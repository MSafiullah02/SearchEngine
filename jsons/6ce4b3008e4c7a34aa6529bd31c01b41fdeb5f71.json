The formation of the replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) through the rearrangement of cellular membranes is currently being actively studied for viruses belonging to different viral families. In this work, we identified doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs) in the cytoplasm of cells infected with the equine torovirus Berne virus (BEV), the prototype member of the Torovirus genus (Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order). Using confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we observed a close relationship between the RTCs and the DMVs of BEV. The examination of BEV-infected cells revealed that the replicase proteins colocalize with each other and with newly synthesized RNA and are associated to the membrane rearrangement induced by BEV. However, the double-stranded RNA, an intermediate of viral replication, is exclusively limited to the interior of DMVs. Our results with BEV resemble those obtained with other related viruses in the Nidovirales order, thus providing new evidence to support the idea that nidoviruses share a common replicative structure based on the DMV arranged clusters.",

            "text": "The torovirus genomic organization is similar to that of all other nidoviruses. The last third of the viral genome encodes the structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), haemagglutinin-esterase (HE), whose coding gene is partially deleted in BEV , and nucleocapsid (N) (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993) , which are individually expressed from a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. As in all nidoviruses, the first two-thirds of the torovirus genome are occupied by two large and overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two partially overlapping replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, of 4569 and 6857 amino acids, respectively (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0C6V7), that are translated from the genomic RNA. Expression of the pp1ab C-terminal end is produced by a ribosomal frameshifting occurring just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon (Brierley et al., 1989; Snijder et al., 1990; den Boon et al., 1991; Siddell et al., 2010) . Among the nidoviruses, the most conserved domain is found in the ORF1b, which includes key enzymes in the viral RNA replication and transcription, like the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the helicase (Hel) among others (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . The mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) are post-translationally released from the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by the viral proteinases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) , the papain-like proteinase and the main proteinase (M pro ), a chymotrypsin-like proteinase responsible for most of the post-translational cleavages. In BEV, this region has been poorly characterized, and thus, the presence of putative functional domains in the torovirus polyproteins has only been predicted by comparative amino acid sequence analysis with other nidoviruses (Snijder et al., 1990; Smits et al., 2006) . The BEV M pro is the only torovirus nsp that has been characterized biochemically to date (Smits et al., 2006) . The BEV M pro is a serine proteinase, like those of arteriviruses (Snijder et al., 1996; Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) and the related bafiniviruses (Ulferts et al., 2011) , but differs from the coronavirus and ronivirus M pro (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Hegyi et al., 2002) , which are cysteine proteinase. Based on the sequence specificity, Smits et al. (2006) proposed a tentative processing scheme for the BEV pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins, where the sequence and localization of the potential cleavage sites of M pro were shown. Also, they pointed out the conservation of the cleavage sites in the BToV sequence published by Draker et al. (2006) .",

The first domain is localized near the papain-like proteinase, and the other two are flanking the M pro domain. These hydrophobic domains are believed to anchor the RTCs to intracellular membranes and are proposed to be responsible for the membrane rearrangement produced during the viral infection (Snijder et al., 2001; Clementz et al., 2008; Gadlage et al., 2010; Angelini et al., 2013) . In this regard, characteristic double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that have been related with the replication/transcription processes have been observed in the cytoplasm of cells infected with different nidoviruses. Specifically, DMVs were observed in cells infected with several betacoronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Gosert et al., 2002; Ulasli et al., 2010) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (de Wilde et al., 2013) , as well as with members of the Alphacoronavirus (NL63-CoV) (Orenstein et al., 2008) and Gammacoronavirus [infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)] (Maier et al., 2013) genera, and with the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) (Pedersen et al., 1999) . Furthermore, the presence of other membranous structures related to the replication/transcription processes was described, such as convoluted membranes Ulasli et al., 2010; de Wilde et al., 2013) or spherules (Maier et al., 2013) . Electron tomography studies performed with SARS-CoV and EAV (Knoops et al., 2012) indicate that actually the DMVs form part of a reticulovesicular network of modified membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that supports the viral replication machinery.",

It has been shown that in cells infected with different nidoviruses, virus-induced membrane reorganization produces characteristic DMVs, as well as other membranous structures, which have been related with the viral RNA replication and transcription processes. However, nothing is known about membrane rearrangements occurring in torovirus-infected cells. Here, E.Derm cells mock infected or infected with BEV for 16 h were subjected to conventional embedding in TAAB-812 epoxy resin and analysed by TEM. In thin sections of infected cells groups of DMVs were observed in the cell cytoplasm, frequently in the perinuclear area and surrounded by mitochondria and ER membranes ( Fig. 1A and B) . These membranous structures were not observed in mock-infected cells (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 , vesicles of different sizes could be observed, ranging from 50 to 150 nm in diameter, but in some cases, large DMVs, bigger than 200 nm, were also seen. Moreover, while some DMVs appeared as empty vesicles, in others, an electron-dense inner content could be observed. Apparently, the DMVs look as independent structures isolated from each other; however, an in-depth inspection of the infected cells revealed the existence of connections between many of them, as well as between DMVs and the ER ( Fig. 1C and D) . In addition, a seeming continuity between DMVs and the mitochondrial-associated ER membranes (MAM) could occasionally be observed ( Fig. 1E and F). The MAM is a subdomain of the ER with different properties and lipid composition, which regulates ER-mitochondria communications and appears as ER tubules closely apposed to mitochondria on the electron micrographs (Raturi and Simmen, 2013) . Although some virions could be seen inside rough ER-derived vesicles close to the DMV clusters (Figs 1B and S1A and B) , at this time post infection (pi), most viral particles appeared accumulated in large vesicles (Fig.  S1C ), usually segregated from these areas.",

Although the freeze substitution protocols have been previously described to improve the preservation of DMVs in other nidoviruses Knoops et al., 2012) , the BEV DMVs were barely identified under these conditions ( Fig. 2A and B) ; nonetheless, those that could be recognized showed a dense inner content. On the other hand, in cryosections from BEV-infected E. Derm, DMVs were clearly seen ( Fig. 2C and D) . As observed in conventional sections of epoxy resin, the DMVs were mainly localized in the perinuclear area and were surrounded by mitochondria and ER membranes. We did not observe differences in the DMV sizes when compared with those observed in epoxy sections; however, in the cryosections, the inner content of most of the DMVs was preserved. Also, some viral particles could be observed in the vicinity of DMV clusters, but in separate areas (Fig. 2C) . However, the large clusters of convoluted membranes found in several coronavirus were not observed in the case of BEV infection.

For these, E.Derm cells infected with BEV were fixed at different times pi and processed for confocal microscopy. The assay was finished at 20 h pi because later times were considered unsuitable for the viral replication studies given that, on one hand, the release of virus progeny already reaches the plateau phase at about 16 h pi, although it is extended until 24 h pi, and on the other hand, cytopathic effects caused by BEV infection are apparent from about 21 h pi (Weiss and Horzinek, 1986 ) and lead to apoptosis (Maestre et al., 2011) . The subcellular distribution pattern throughout the infection was almost identical for the three proteins. As exemplified in Fig. 3A for M pro , for all of them, the first signal was observed between 4 and 6 h pi, but it increased in intensity from 8 h pi onwards. At early times pi, these proteins were localized in dispersed and discrete foci in the cells, which develop into a number of densely labelled areas, giving rise to a ring-like signal distantly surrounding the nucleus at 10-12 h pi, but which moves towards the nucleus later in infection. The mock-infected cells were not stained with any of these antibodies (not shown).",

However, the anti-Hel serum did not react with any specific protein by this assay. On the other hand, the two anti-M pro sera obtained recognized the mature M pro of 33 kDa characterized by Smits and co-workers, but curiously, the serum produced in rabbit detected an additional protein of 16 kDa. Smits and co-workers predicted an internal cleavage site in the M pro of BEV and showed that the protein was processed at this site when expressed in bacterial cells, but they did not find evidence of that internal processing in mammalian cells infected with BEV (Smits et al., 2006) .",

These results confirm that the Hel, the RdRp and the M pro are localized in the same areas, which likely represent the sites where the viral replication and transcription occur. Similar studies were performed using antibodies directed against the BEV structural M protein, a protein essential for the viral assembly process. Previously, we described that at early times pi the M protein accumulates at the perinuclear area, specifically within the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where the virus assembly is thought to occur, and at later times, the signal corresponding to the M protein spreads towards the cell surface once the protein was incorporated into the progeny virions (Garzon et al., 2006) . Figure 4C shows that the M protein does not colocalize with the M pro at 8 h pi. Both proteins showed different distributions along the infection as confirmed by the quantitative colocalization study that gave r values lower than 0.5 (0.22 \u00b1 0.03 at 8 h pi, 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 at 12 h pi and 0.24 \u00b1 0.06 at 16 h pi) (Fig. 4D ). The analysis was extended to the S and N structural proteins with similar results, although there could be a certain degree of colocalization between N and M pro at an earlier time point (6 h pi) (data not shown). The lack of colocalization between the structural proteins and the nsps indicates that the sites of viral replication are separated from the sites of virus assembly.",

To determine whether in BEV-infected cells the nsps are located at the sites of viral RNA synthesis, we used an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody (mAb). E.Derm cells infected with BEV were fixed at 8, 12 and 16 h pi and stained with the anti-dsRNA and anti-M pro antibodies. The dsRNA staining was detected in bright dots, whose number increases along the infection, reaching a steady state at about 10 h pi (data not shown). We did not observe clear colocalization between M pro and dsRNA at any time pi, as exemplified in Fig. 5A for 8 h pi and as determined by the quantitative analysis that showed r values below 0.5 at either time pi analysed in this assay (0.13 \u00b1 0.03 at 8 h pi, 0.13 \u00b1 0.02 at 12 h pi and 0.10 \u00b1 0.01 at 16 h pi) (Fig. 5C ).

For this, E.Derm cells infected with BEV were treated with actinomycin D to block host cell messenger RNA synthesis and simultaneously incubated with 5-bromouridine (5-BrU) for 1 h before fixation, as described in the Experimental Procedures section. The nascent RNA immunolabelled with anti-BrdU-specific antibodies exhibited a staining pattern very similar to those of the nsps (Fig. S4) . The signal associated to the newly synthesized RNA was first detected between 4 and 6 h pi, was more apparent from 8 h pi, and kept increasing along the infection until 16-18 h pi, at which time RNA synthesis was turned off in many cells (Fig. S4 ). This result indicates that viral RNA synthesis takes place mainly between 8 and 12 h pi and ceases at around 16 h pi. As shown in Fig. 5B , in cells stained with anti-BrdU and anti-M pro specific antibodies, a clear colocalization was observed between the nascent RNA (BrU-RNA) and M pro at 8 h pi. The r values for the BrU-RNA-M pro pair at 8 and 12 h pi were of 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.58 \u00b1 0.02 respectively (Fig. 5C ). However, at 16 h pi we observed an r value slightly below 0.5 (0.48 \u00b1 0.06). This low value could be explained by the shutoff of RNA synthesis in some cells at this time pi, since in those cells where the BrU-RNA signal was still observed at 16 h pi, the r value was similar to those obtained at 8 or 12 h pi.",

To analyse if the M pro and the RdRp of BEV are membrane-associated proteins, E.Derm cells mock infected or infected with BEV were homogenized and subjected to differential ultracentrifugation such that cellular membranes were pelleted (P100) and separated from the cytosolic fraction (S100). Both fractions were analysed by Western blot with antibodies against M pro and RdRp, and against specific markers for cytosolic proteins [glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)] or membrane proteins (p-cadherins). As shown in Fig. 6B , both proteins, the M pro and RdRp, were found within the membrane fraction. Clearly, the pattern observed in immunolabelled cryosections reveals that the dsRNA is located inside the DMVs, surrounded by the nsps anchored to the adjacent membranes. However, this pattern was less clear in the immunofluorescence assay shown previously in Fig. 5A . For this reason, sequential z-sections with a step size optimized were captured to generate three-dimensional (3D) images of dsRNA and M pro using confocal images ( Fig. 7 and Movie S1). The 3D reconstruction generated (Fig. 7B) shows that part of the dsRNA is localized inside the volume formed by the M pro (Fig. 7C) .",

            "text": "In this study, the RTCs of a member of the torovirus genus are described for the first time, and a preliminary characterization has been performed. First, we carried out an ultrastructural study to analyse the cellular membrane rearrangements elicited upon torovirus infection. The presence of characteristic DMVs within the cytoplasm of cells infected with BEV was observed both in equine E.Derm cells and in human MRC5 cells, treated under different preservation conditions, such as conventional chemical fixation or cryofixation. However, the BEV DMVs were poorly visualized under the cryofixation and freeze substitution conditions used in this study. A cryofixation and freeze substitution method was previously used by Snijder et al. (2006) to improve the preservation of DMVs in SARS-CoV-infected cells for their examination by TEM, and later utilized for electron tomography studies, with some minor changes . The same group described the presence of DMVs in EAV-infected cells using a similar protocol; however, for the tomography assays, they included highpressure freezing before freeze substitution (HPF-FS) to further improve DMV preservation (Knoops et al., 2012) . In our assay, the membranes appeared poorly contrasted by this technique, probably owing to differences in the cryofixation and embedding conditions with regard to the protocols used for SARS-CoV and EAV. Although the HPF-FS has been recognized as an efficient technique for preserving DMVs (Limpens et al., 2011; Knoops et al., 2012; Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Maier et al., 2013) , the embedding in epoxy resin TAAB-812 protocol used in these assays provided a high preservation of the cellular structures as well as of the DMVs, which exhibit the spherical shape similar to that previously observed in other nidoviruses. Moreover, the great ultrastructural preservation achieved in this study allows us to clearly distinguish the two tightly apposed membranes of the DMVs, most of which show an electron-dense inner content, as well as to visualize membranous connections among different DMVs and between DMVs and ER membranes. Apparently, the DMVs arranged during BEV infection look like independent structures separated from each other; however, as mentioned earlier, an in-depth inspection of the infected cells revealed the existence of connections between many of them and between them and ER membranes. This suggests that, as has been described to occur with the related SARS-CoV and EAV (Knoops et al., 2012) , the BEV-induced DMVs form part of a network of modified membranes derived from the ER. Nonetheless, a more sophisticated ultrastructural analysis would be required to confirm the existence of this network. An apparent difference with SARS-CoV or EAV (Knoops et al., 2012) was the absence of ribosomes associated to the outer membranes of the BEV DMVs. We observed ribosomes attached to ER membrane but not in association with the DMVs.",

The absence of convoluted membranes in torovirus, as well as in cells infected with EAV (van Hemert et al., 2008) or IBV (Maier et al., 2013) , supports the idea that these structures are specific to betacoronaviruses.

Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the presence of these structures in the BEV-infected cells because their appearance in two-dimensional ultrastructural studies is very similar to that of the DMVs, and, therefore, the application of 3D studies is essential to elucidate the presence or the absence of spherules in BEVinfected cell.",

Concerning this, we observed clusters of DMVs with apparent continuity with ER tubules closely apposed to mitochondria, which might represent the areas of communication between these two organelles, known as MAMs. Recently, Friesland et al. (2013) have suggested that the membranes of the MAM could serve as platforms for initial RNA replication during hepatitis C virus infection, a virus that induces DMVs with similar characteristics to those produced by nidoviruses. The interaction between virus replication factories and MAMs is probably due to the fact that viruses need the energy produced by the mitochondria for their processes, and hence, the formation of their replicative platforms from MAMs could be advantageous to obtain this energy. Moreover, MAMs play a major role in lipid metabolism, a function that could be essential for the membrane remodelling process induced by the virus. However, biochemical assays are indispensable to confirm the implication of MAMs with the DMVs of BEV.",

            "text": "To investigate whether torovirus DMVs are the sites where replication and transcription occur, we obtained specific sera for the BEV M pro , Hel and RdRp, three key proteins in the formation and functioning of RTCs. All showed a high colocalization with each other and with newly synthesized RNAs. However, the dsRNA, widely used as a marker of RTC in several positive-strand RNA viruses, only showed a partial colocalization with the nsps. A 3D reconstruction of confocal images showed that part of the dsRNA is localized inside the volume occupied by the M pro . Additionally, the immunolabelling assays on cryosections indicated that the nsps are associated to DMV membranes or to the adjacent membranes, while the dsRNA was exclusively detected inside DMVs. An apparent separation between the bulk of the nsps and most of the dsRNA was previously described for other nidoviruses Maier et al., 2013) . Therefore, in nidoviruses, the relationship between the sites of dsRNA accumulation and RTCs remains an open question. The apparent absence of pores connecting the interior of DMVs with the cytoplasm and the presence of dsRNA inside of these DMVs, as well as the lack of colocalization with replicase proteins, suggested the idea that many DMVs are not actively involved in RNA synthesis and might instead represent shielding structures that protect the dsRNA molecules from the detection by the innate immune sensors (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) . Other authors consider that a huge excess of nsps may be produced in virus-infected cells, with only a fraction of these molecules actively participating in viral RNA synthesis . We believe that the DMVs formed in torovirus-infected cells are the sites where the replication and transcription occur. By confocal microscopy, we observed a clear colocalization between the newly synthesized RNA and the nsps, but attempts to perform similar studies by immunoelectronmicroscopy were unsuccessful. On the other hand, it has to be considered that the colocalization between the newly synthesized RNA and nsps does not necessarily imply that those are areas of active replication exclusively; they can also represent sites of protein translation, as it probably occurs in the regions that are positive for the nascent RNA and the M protein (Fig. S5) . Colocalization studies between the dsRNA and the newly synthesized RNA could help to resolve this question. Our attempts to perform these assays have failed because of the unavailability of an adequate combination of antibodies for the double labelling. Similar assays were performed in MHV-infected cells, where the dsRNA and an analogue of uridine, EU, were placed at closely adjacent locations, but only at an early time pi (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) . Similar results were described for EAV (Knoops et al., 2012) , where a limited colocalization between the nsps and dsRNA was described at an early time pi. In this regard, we did not observe colocalization of the BEV nsps characterized here with the dsRNA at any time of infection, although the signals observed by confocal microscopy corresponding to nsps and dsRNA were closely juxtaposed in many areas at all pi times analysed.",

            "text": "Finally, we have attempted to determine the membranous origin of the DMVs using specific organelle markers. None of the markers used in these confocal microscopy assays, to identify early endosomes, Golgi, ERGIC, lysosomes, ER, mitochondria or MAM, showed a clear colocalization with the M pro protein. However PDI, calnexin, MitoTracker and S1R, markers of ER, mitochondria and MAM respectively, were found surrounding the M pro signal or even partially colocalizing with it. These results together with the fact that the TEM assays showed that the DMVs are connected with the ER, and probably with the MAM, lead us to believe that the membranes of this organelle are the donors for the DMV formation. The absence of colocalization between the traditional ER markers and nsps may be due to the high accumulation of BEV nsps in this region, which could promote the exclusion of these cellular proteins. The origin of the rearranged membranes produced by the studied coronaviruses for their replication is also in question. From the TEM assays, it appears that coronaviruses subvert the ER membrane to establish their replication factories. However, the absence of conventional ER markers in virus-induced membranous structures Ulasli et al., 2010) makes it difficult to undoubtedly establish their origin. Only colocalization with the ER protein sec61 and a partial colocalization with PDI were reported (Knoops et al., 2010) . Some studies indicated that the origin is found in specific organelles derived from the ER, like the autophagosome. By their very nature, DMVs resemble cellular autophagosomes generated during the cellular autophagy process. Nonetheless, the relationship between DMV formation and autophagy is not clear, as although it has been shown that some coronaviruses induce autophagy (Prentice et al., 2004; Snijder et al., 2006) , this process is not required for virus replication (Zhao et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2012) . Furthermore, it has been described that the coronavirus nsp6 protein generates autophagosomes from the ER via an omegasome intermediate (Cottam et al., 2011) . The relationship between BEV and the autophagy pathway is as yet unknown, but we have some ongoing work to clarify this issue. Recent reports described an autophagyindependent role for LC3 in several nidovirus infections, where the ER-derived membranes of EDEMosomes may be the platform for virus replication, showing that the RTCs of MHV and EAV colocalize with markers for cellular EDEMosomes, as EDEM1 and OS-9. Our attempts to explore this possibility in BEV-infected cells were inconclusive.",

Briefly, cells were scraped in PBS, collected by low-speed centrifugation and resuspended in cold sucrose-Tris buffer [10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 200 mM sucrose] with protease inhibitors (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; Roche). The cell suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei. The post-nuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 000 \u00d7 g for 15 min in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge, using a Beckman rotor (TLA-120) to pellet the membranes. The final supernatant was saved as the cytosol material (S100), and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of sucrose-Tris buffer (P100). Immunogold labelling. Ultrathin cryosections were obtained as described earlier with a slight modification in the fixation to preserve the antigen-antibody reactivity. In this case, the infected cells were fixed by adding an equal volume of a 2\u00d7 fixative solution (8% PFA in PHEM buffer) to the culture medium. After 30 min at room temperature, the solution was replaced by a 1\u00d7 fixative solution (4% PFA in PHEM buffer) and cells were incubated for an additional hour. After, the cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a solution with 8% PFA in PHEM buffer and were processed for cryosections as described earlier. Ultrathin cryosections maintained in the sucrose : methylcellulose mixture were incubated in 2% gelatin in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. The sections were then incubated with 0.15% glycine in PBS, with four changes of 2 min each and blocked by incubation in PBS with 10% FCS for 10 min.

The cells were then cryoprotected with glycerol at 4\u00b0C (15 min with 15% glycerol in PBS and another incubation of 15 min in 30% glycerol in PBS). Cells were subsequently subjected to plunge freezing in liquid propane using a KF80 (Leica) cryofixation equipment. Freeze substitution was carried out in an automated freeze substitution system (Leica) in pure methanol containing 0.5% uranyl acetate. Samples were kept at \u00c085\u00b0C for 54 h, after which the temperature was raised by 5\u00b0C h \u00c01 to \u00c050\u00b0C. After being washed with pure methanol several times, the cells were embedded in Lowicryl HM20 (Polysciences Europe GmbH, Germany) at \u00c045\u00b0C following the manufacturer's instructions. Ultrathin sections (70-80 nm) were obtained as described earlier.Cryosections. To obtain ultrathin cryosections (Tokuyasu method)(Slot and Geuze, 2007), E.Derm cells infected with BEV were fixed in situ for 2 h at room temperature in a solution of 4% PFA and 1% glutaraldehyde in PHEM buffer (240 mM Pipes, 100 mM Hepes, 8 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, pH 6.9), followed by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative solution. After several washes, the cells were pelleted, embedded in 12% gelatin and cryoprotected by overnight incubation in 2.3 M sucrose in PHEM buffer. Mounted gelatin blocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections (70-80 nm) were obtained at -120\u00b0C by using a Leica UCT ultramicrotome, equipped with an FCS cryochamber, and were picked up in a 1:1 mixture of 2.3 M sucrose : 2% methylcellulose and deposited on Formvar-coated grids. Ultrathin cryosections maintained in the sucrose : methylcellulose mixture were incubated in 2% gelatin in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. Then, sections were washed with bidistilled water and finally stained and embedded with a mix of 1.8% methylcellulose and 0.4% uranyl acetate.",
