            "text": "Sulfated polyhydroxysterols are naturally occurring metabolites in sponges and echinoderms [1], [2]. These compounds have exhibited a broad spectrum of biologic activities, such as anti-HIV effects [3] and inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases [4]. Among echinoderms, ophiuroids are characterized by their content of sulfated steroids with sulfate groups located at C-3 and C-21 and additional hydroxy groups located in rings A and C. Recently, we have demonstrated the antiviral activity of sulfated steroids isolated from the cold water ophiuroids, Ophioplocus januarii\n[5] and Astrotoma agassizii\n[6], and synthetic derivatives and analogs against pathogenic viruses of humans [7]. Steroids sulfated at C-21 and C-2 (\u03b2) or C-3 (\u03b1) with an additional hydroxyl function at C-2 (\u03b2) or C-3 (\u03b1) were the most effective in their inhibitory action against herpes simplex virus (HSV-2). These results prompted us to synthesize disodium 2\u03b2,3\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u03b1-cholestane (8) disulfate as well as monosulfated and acetylated derivatives of 2\u03b2,3\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u03b1-cholestane (6, 7, 12, 13) (Fig. 1\n) in order to evaluate the antiviral activity of these compounds and gain insight into structure\u2013activity correlations.",

This is in accordance with the chemical shifts observed for C-2 (76.1) and C-3 (76.1) in the 13C NMR spectrum. The 13C NMR spectra of monosulfated compounds 6 and 7 differed in the chemical shifts of C-1 (\u03b4 41.0 in 6, 38.8 in 7), C-2 (\u03b4 70.0 in 6, 78.8 in 7), C-3 (\u03b4 78.5 in 6, 69.0 in 7), and C-4 (\u03b4 30.3 in 6, 32.5 in 7). The downfield shift of 9.5 ppm for C-3 and the upfield shift of 2.2 ppm for C-4 in compound 6 indicated that the sulfate group was located at C-3.

The presence of the sulfate group at C-2 in 7 was confirmed by the downfield shift of 8.8 ppm for C-2 and the upfield shift of 2.2 ppm for C-1. 1H NMR spectra showed signals at \u03b4 4.08 (H-2) and 4.40 (H-3) for compound 6 and \u03b4 4.42 (H-2) and 4.02 (H-3) for compound 7, confirming the sulfate groups positions in monosulfated derivatives 6 and 7.",

These results indicated that, as it was expected, groups attached to C-3 with \u03b1 configuration were more reactive than those attached to C-2 (\u03b2) because of the steric hindrance due to the axial methyl group (C-19) at C-10 (Fig. 2\n).",

From the data shown in Table 3\n, compounds 7 and 8 were the most active against HSV-2 with IC50 values of 19.3 and 23.9 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Monosulfated steroid 6, differing from 7 in the position of the sulfate group as well as acetylated and sulfated compound 13 were not active against HSV-2 at a concentration up to 25 \u03bcg/ml. The four steroids also showed virucidal activity against HSV-2 with values of VC50 ranging from 19.4 to 76.0 \u03bcg/ml. Due to its low cytotoxic effect on Vero cells, the monosulfated steroid 12 containing an acetyl group at C-2 was assayed for antiviral activity at a higher concentration. Nevertheless, only a weak inhibitory activity against HSV-2 was observed (IC50=90.5 \u03bcg/ml). No virucidal effect of this compound was observed up to 100 \u03bcg/ml. Of all the synthetic compounds tested, disulfated steroid 8 showed the best selectivity index (SI=2.8). This result enabled us to test the antiviral activity of 8 against two pathogenic viruses in humans: JV and DEN-2. JV causes a severe disease in humans known as Argentine hemorrhagic fever [16] and DEN infection results in acute febrile illness or a more severe manifestation known as DEN hemorrhagic fever-shock syndrome [17]. Derivative 8 was not active against JV at a concentration up to 25 \u03bcg/ml, while it elicited a marked DEN-2 inhibitory activity (IC50=16.9\u00b10.2 \u03bcg/ml).",
