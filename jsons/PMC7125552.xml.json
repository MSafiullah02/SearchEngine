            "text": "Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) includes non-enveloped, double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses belonging to the genus Orthoreovirus within the family Reoviridae, which are responsible for either symptomatic or asymptomatic infections in mammals and possess a broad host range (Tyler, 2001). Their genome contains 10 dsRNA segments, which are designed as large (L, three segments), medium (M, three segments) or small (S, four segments) on the basis of the electrophoretic mobility (Nibert and Schiff, 2001). Three MRV serotypes have been recognized so far, which are distinguishable by means of the capacity of anti-reovirus sera to neutralize viral infectivity and inhibit hemagglutination (HA) (Rosen, 1960, Sabin, 1959). Neutralization and HA activities are restricted to a single reovirus gene segment, S1 (Weiner and Fields, 1977), that encodes for \u03c31 and \u03c31s proteins. The \u03c31 protein, a fibrous trimer located on the outer capsid of the virion (Fraser et al., 1990, Furlong et al., 1988), is responsible for viral attachment on cellular receptors (Lee et al., 1981, Weiner et al., 1980), serotype-specific neutralization (Bassel-Duby et al., 1986) and hemagglutination (Weiner et al., 1978). Analysis of the S1 gene of MRVs belonging to different serotypes has shown a strict correlation between sequence similarity and viral serotype (Cashdollar et al., 1985, Duncan et al., 1990, Nibert et al., 1990). Conversely, the other genome segments show no correlation to viral serotype, suggesting that mammalian reoviruses have evolved independently of serotype (Breun et al., 2001, Chappel et al., 1994, Goral et al., 1996, Kedl et al., 1995, Leary et al., 2002).",

Cells inoculated with sample 214/04-A showed no cytopathic effect (CPE), in spite of a strong CPV-2 specific intranuclear fluorescence, whereas, unexpectedly, in the cells inoculated with sample 214/04-B a CPE was observed, that was characterized by rounding of the infected cells and deterioration of the cell monolayer, in spite of a very weak signal by the IF assay for CPV-2. In order to prevent CPV-2 replication on cell cultures, CPV-2 was selected against by using a monoclonal antibody (A4E3). There was no evidence for growth of CPV-2 in the subsequent passages, as shown by both IF and real-time PCR assays. In contrast, the CPE progressively increased, with complete destruction of the inoculated monolayers. The inoculated cells were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for detection of inclusion bodies. Negative staining electron microscopy examination was carried out on the cryolysate of the infected cell cultures showing evident CPE.",

To date, there are a few reports on the epidemiology of reoviruses in dogs, although all the three MRV serotypes have been isolated in such species (Binn et al., 1977, Kokubu et al., 1993, Lou and Wenner, 1963, Massie and Shaw, 1966). MRV-1 strains have been recovered from dogs with pneumonia (Lou and Wenner, 1963) or enteritis (Appel, 1987), in association with either canine distemper virus or CPV-2. MRV-2 and MRV-3 have been isolated from dogs with upper respiratory tract disease (Binn et al., 1977) and diarrhea (Kokubu et al., 1993), respectively. However, to our knowledge, none of the isolates was characterized at the molecular level and no sequence data is available in the databases. As in other mammalians, the pathogenetic role of reoviruses in dogs is still unclear, since attempts to reproduce a specific disease in germ- and disease-free dogs resulted in contrasting findings (Appel, 1987, Holzinger and Griesemer, 1966). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that MRV infection may act in synergism with other pathogens, aggravating the course of concomitant infections (Appel, 1987). Herewith, we described a double infection by MRV and CPV-2 in a dog died from severe enteritis. MRV was not detected in the CPV-2 infected dog that survived, even if MRV-specific antibodies were detectable 4 weeks after the onset of the disease, indicating that the dog had been exposed to MRV-3 infection as well.",

In mice and in non-human primates, reovirus infections can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems (Tyler, 2001). In humans, mammalian reoviruses are mainly responsible for respiratory and/or enteric disease. However, MRV-3 infection has been associated to a case of meningitis in a child (Tyler et al., 2004). The ability to induce neurological disease is a characteristic of MRV-3 and a neurovirulent MRV-3 strain has been isolated from a cat with ataxia (Csiza, 1974). Because of the apparent lack of species barriers, MRVs may potentially spread from animals to humans and vice versa. From this perspective, further studies would help obtaining a more in-depth understanding of the ecology of reoviruses.",
