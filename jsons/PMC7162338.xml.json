            "text": "Seizuring in cats is mainly a neurological manifestation of underlying diseases (Boothe et al, 2002). However, cats can suffer from primary epilepsy, also known as probably symptomatic epilepsy or idiopathic epilepsy. The true incidence of the primary epilepsy in cats is unknown but it has been estimated to be as high as 20\u201360% of all seizuring cats (Quesnel et al, 1997; Schriefl et al, 2008). The increasing access to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis confirms that there are a substantial number of cases without a diagnosed underlying cause. Affected cats vary from 1\u201312 years of age with presentation of generalised and/or partial seizures, and have normal interictal neurological examination (Schriefl et al, 2008).",

The diseases of the young animals are mainly the anomalous, congenital or infectious diseases. Multiple littermates can be affected and the only complaint is the seizure activity in many cases. The adult and old cats suffer more common inflammatory or neoplastic disease. The classical examples are anomalous/congenital diseases, usually diagnosed in kittens, that should not be firstly considered as a differential diagnosis for older cats with seizures. A number of different congenital brain malformations can cause seizures in young kittens; these include hydrocephalus, porencephaly, lissencephaly and others. Cats with porencephaly have cystic cavities within their cerebrum, and intrauterine feline parvovirus infection of the queen has been postulated as a possible cause for this (Summers et al, 1995) (\nFigure 1\n). Treatment is aimed at controlling the seizures, and the prognosis will depend on the response to treatment. Cats with an obstructive hydrocephalus may require surgical placement of a shunt to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricular system to the peritoneum (ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Although this is preferential treatment in cats with congenital hydrocephalus, it is not treating the primary condition and is only palliative. However, the outcome is good if no complications of the shunt device do occur. Some patients can be managed conservatively, mainly with the drugs decreasing the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",

Various lysosomal storage diseases can cause seizures through interference of neuronal metabolism or accumulation of intracellular by\u2010products, although seizure activity usually manifests as a late event in the course of the disease. The identification of the affected enzyme and/or the affected gene is usually not possible and the intracellular by\u2010product may be found in whole blood, leucocytes, skin or liver biopsies. In some cases, accumulated storage product can be found in the urine. The prognosis for confirmed lysosomal storage diseases is poor and no specific treatment is available (Dewey, 2008).",

This is important add\u2010on information from the owners because the underlying brain pathology should be considered more likely if the cat presents with such symptoms. If the aggression, along with the partial seizures, is a primary problem then hippocampal necrosis or temporal epilepsy should be considered. Hippocampal necrosis affects the hippocampus and the piriform lobes and is a potential cause of seizure activity. However, it is debatable as to whether this develops as a consequence of inappropriately treated seizure activity or if it is an underlying cause of the seizures. Some authors suggest that seizure activity caused by degenerative, metabolic or toxic disorders can cause bilateral destruction of the hippocampus or of the piriform lobes. Diagnosis is usually made by characteristic MRI features of bilaterally hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted and hypointense lesions on T1 weighted images without a mass effect, and variable contrast uptake in the hippocampus (Schmied et al, 2008).",

The incidence of seizures in cats with permethrine intoxication is about 30%, and other neurological signs, such as tremors, twitching, ataxia, ptyalism and mydriasis, are also very common (Boland and Angles, 2010). Clinical sings are usually noticed immediately after exposure or may be delayed for up to 72 hours. Dermal decontamination should be instituted as soon as possible. Diazepam, methacarbamol and phenobarbitone can be used in case of seizures.

Nowadays, it is more commonly seen secondary to reduced food intake.

Taking the cat's temperature, palpating lymph nodes and thyroid glands, performing abdominal palpation and thoracic auscultation with measurement of blood pressure are basic examinations. When dealing with a seizuring cat, this information will be immensely helpful in constructing the differential diagnoses list and deciding on diagnostic work\u2010up for the most likely causes of seizures, or seizure\u2010mimicking episodes in that particular cat. Disorders causing cerebral hypoxia (e.g. polycythaemia, anaemia, cardiomyopathies) can lead to development of the seizures or episodes mimicking seizures. Hyperthyroidism can cause seizures but more commonly causes encephalopathic signs, such as behavioural change and irritability. The increased circulating thyroid hormone concentration is proposed to cause an alteration in brain neurotransmitter balance and to increase the excitability of the brain parenchyma (Dewey, 2008). Systemic hypertension can arise from hyperglucorticoidaemia (hyperadrenocorticism, iatrogenic), renal disease, hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus. Systemic hypertension leads to interstitial cerebral oedema, which increases intracranial pressure, resulting in subsequent neurological signs, and is referred to as hypertensive encephalopathy (Brown, 2005). Hypertension is also a potential risk factor for developing haemorrhagic or thrombotic infarctions within the brain, which predispose to seizure activity (Brown, 2005).",

The signs of hypertension or other systemic diseases can also be recognised, such as inflammatory or infectious diseases or lymphoma. Feline coronavirus associated meningoencephalitis is one of the most common feline infectious neurological diseases. Cats will often show other systemic signs including pyrexia, lethargy, chorioretinitis and uveitis. The affected cats develop clinical signs when usually under 2 years or later in their life when they are older than 9 years of age. Cerebellar and vestibular signs are the most common presentations, with seizures seen in approximately 25% of cases (Timmann et al., 2008). Characteristic abnormalities on MRI are: obstructive hydrocephalus; ependymitis; and meningitis. Elevated protein and neutrophilic pleocytosis in CSF together with the clinical signs, age, MRI findings and positive coronavirus antibodies or PCR in the CSF are suggestive of the in vivo diagnosis of feline coronavirus infection (\nFigure 3\n).",

            "text": "The seizure is the presentation of forebrain dysfunction. Because forebrain dysfunction is sometimes difficult to assess on the neurological examination in animals, it is important to realise that the seizure can be the only neurological sign. The neurological examination can be completely normal in the interictal period, even in cases with very significant underlying pathology. It is, however, very important to perform the neurological examination, which can reveal symmetrical or asymmetrical neurological deficits. When we are dealing with the cat with symmetrical signs, metabolic or toxic causes should be considered as the most likely differential diagnosis. If asymmetric signs are noted (for example obtundation, aimless pacing, circling, absent or reduced menace response, central blindness or other cranial nerve deficits), intracranial lesions, such as tumours, or a vascular event must be at the top of your differentials list. The incidence of seizures in cats with intracranial tumours is about 20%, and generalised tonic\u2010clonic seizures are commonly seen (Tomek et al, 2006). Meningiomas are the most common intracranial tumours in cats, and seizure activity is reported in approximately 15\u201325% of the cases (Troxel et al, 2003; Tomek et al, 2006). They are usually solitary, well\u2010circumscribed masses, and surgical removal is the treatment of choice with disease\u2010free survival times reported as 2 years (\nFigures 4\n and 5). Lymphoma is very common in cats and, in fact, is the second most common tumour affecting cats\u2019 brains (Troxel et al, 2003). The seizures are seen in about 25% of cases with lymphoma affecting brain (Tomek et al, 2006). Lymphoma can be diagnosed by finding lymphoblasts in the CSF (\nFigure 6\n). It can affect any part of the CNS, and may be part of a multicentric disease process. Other primary or metastatic intracranial tumours can also infrequently cause seizures.",

Minimum biochemical database (ALT, albumin, total protein, Glucose, BUN, Creatinine) and electrolyte tests (Na, K, P, Ca) should be performed in order to rule out a possible metabolic cause of the seizures. Metabolic causes of seizure activity include hepatic, renal and electrolyte\u2010associated encephalopathy, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypocalcaemia (Dewey, 2008). The majority of cases of hepatic encephalopathy are due to underlying liver dysfunction, such as hepatic lipidosis, or from structural abnormalities, such as a portosystemic shunt (\nFigure 7\n). Ptyalism is extremely common in cats with hepatic encephalopathy with stunted growth and copper\u2010coloured eyes also being common presenting features of cats with portosystemic shunts (\nFigure 8\n). Hypoglycaemia can result from severe liver disease, insulin overdose, sepsis or an insulinoma; the latter is very rare in the cat. The investigation for metabolic causes of seizure activity may require a bile acid stimulation test, endocrine testing and urine analysis, with abdominal ultrasonography and histopathology as required. Hyperthyroidism is common in older cats and can cause the seizures (Dewey, 2008). So, to run a total feline T4 test in older cats with seizures is also recommended.",

Therapeutic levels are similar to those reported for dogs at 65\u2013170 \u03bcmol/l (15\u201340 \u03bcg/ml) with the ideal range being between 90\u2013130 \u03bcmol/l (20\u201330 \u03bcg/ml) (Smith\u2010Bailey and Dewey, 2009). The phenobarbitone levels should be measured ideally every 3\u20136 months if the seizure control is adequate. If the seizure control is not adequate or the frequency of dosing increased, the measurement of phenobarbitone level should be performed more frequently. Regular monitoring of haematology and serum biochemistry is important. Phenobarbitone cannot be withdrawn abruptly as \u2018withdrawal seizures\u2019 can occur, but patients can develop a physical dependence on phenobarbitone (Podell, 2004).",

The dose is 10\u201320mg/kg three times daily. The rare side effects reported are salivation, transient sedation and inappetence. The majority of the levetiracetam is excreted in the urine, and dose should be adjusted in the patient with impaired renal function. A recent study has shown that levetiracetam is a useful adjunctive treatment to phenobarbitone in reduction of seizure frequency (Smith Bailey and Dewey, 2009).",
