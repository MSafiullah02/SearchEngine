Some areas continue to provoke debate especially concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. Guidelines recommend maintaining platelet count at 100,000 after a central nervous system bleeding event. This would also be the case immediately prior to and after surgery performed on the central nervous system. This patient has a potentially life-threatening intracranial bleeding. The bleeding source is probably secondary to hypertensive disease and not thrombocytopenia. However, the patient is at continued risk for extension of the intracerebral bleeding because of her thrombocytopenia.

They are prone to gastrointestinal infections such as giardia. They also have an increased risk of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Some patients with IgA defi ciency have anaphylactic reactions to blood products containing IgA. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is the main blood component containing IgA antibodies. Anaphylaxis may occur with a variety of transfusions including FFP, platelets, and erythrocytes.

Atherosclerotic claudication is also seen in older patients. It has a steady progression. It starts with exercise-related pain and progresses slowly to pain at rest. Raynaud phenomenon is seen mostly in women. It is caused by vasospasm of small arterioles. It more commonly occurs in the hands but can be seen in the feet. The vasospasm is precipitated by cold, temperature change, or stress. Color changes, which can be profound, occur in the digits from white to blue to red. Pain is usually not severe and peripheral pulses remain intact even during episodes of vasospasm. In Buerger's disease, among patients who stop smoking, 94 % avoid amputation.

Several studies have confi rmed this. Preoperative malnutrition is an independent predictor of length of hospital stay, 30-day, and 60-day mortality, as well as minor medical complications, in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery.

            "text": "The most likely cause of his paralysis is? A) Early cerebral infarction B) Todd's paralysis C) Malingering D) Migraine variant E) Conversion disorder Answer: C This patient has several factors that suggest malingering. He presents with two relatively easy to mimic symptoms. First, he has a seizure with no eleptiform activity and then paralysis with a normal MRI. His recent travel from another area is also suggestive of the diagnosis. Malingering is not considered a mental illness and its diagnosis and treatment can be diffi cult. Direct confrontation may not work best. Hostility, lawsuits, and occasionally violence may result. It may be best to confront the person indirectly by remarking that the objective fi ndings do not meet the objective criteria for diagnosis. It is important to demonstrate to the patient that his abnormal behavior has been observed and will be documented. At the same time an attempt should be made to allow the patient who is malingering the opportunity to save face. Obviously this can be a challenge. Invasive diagnostic maneuvers, consultations, and prolonged hospitalizations often do more harm than good and add fuel to the fi re. People who malinger rarely accept psychiatric referral, and the success of such consultations is minimal. It may be considered to address a specifi c psychiatric complaint. The most common goals of people who malinger in the emergency department are obtaining drugs and shelter. It may be benefi cial to offer the patient some limited assistance in these areas. In the clinic or offi ce, the most common goal is fi nancial compensation. 259. A 60-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is admitted for a hip fracture sustained after a fall.

B) Parenteral nutrition has not consistently been shown to result in a decrease in mortality, compared with standard care. C) The use of oral supplements in all hospitalized elderly patients has been shown to be benefi cial. D) Immune-modulating supplements are no better than standard high-protein formulas in critically ill patients. E) All of the above Answer: E Comparisons of enteral nutrition with parenteral nutrition have consistently shown fewer infectious complications with enteral nutrition. Several studies have looked at specialized feeding formulas in the treatment of the critically ill. There is little evidence to support their use over standard high-protein formulas. In one study among adult patients breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, immune-modulating formulas compared with a standard high-protein formula did not improve infectious complications or other clinical end points. Elderly patients require special consideration. A trial in 501 hospitalized elderly patients randomized to oral supplements or a regular diet showed that, irrespective of their initial nutritional status, the patients receiving oral supplements had lower mortality, better mobility, and a shorter hospital stay. 261.

In this particular case, a heart rate of 108 bpm is acceptable, and patient the can be discharged on her current medications. Follow-up with her primary care physician should be obtained to monitor heart rate. Digoxin can be used in the acute setting but does little to control the ventricular rate in active patients.

A) Transfusion-related acute lung injury B) Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction C) Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction D) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload E) Transfusion-related sepsis Answer: A This patient has likely developed transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The patient developed dyspnea, diffuse pulmonary infi ltrates, and hypoxia acutely during the blood transfusion. It usually occurs shortly after the transfusion or can be delayed for several hours. Both the classic and delayed TRALI syndromes are among the most frequent complications following the transfusion of blood products. They are associated with signifi cant morbidity and increased mortality. Antileukocyte antibodies in the donor blood product directed against the recipient leukocytes cause this reaction. TRALI can occur with any blood product. Which of the following is most likely regarding cognitive function in patients such as this? A) Return to baseline in an average of 5 days B) Return to baseline in 2 weeks C) Return to baseline in an average of 30 days D) Return to baseline in an average of 6 months E) Permanent loss of cognitive function Answer: A Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is common in adult patients of all ages, recovery in the younger age group is usually within 5 days, and complete recovery is the norm for patients less than 60 years old. Patients older than 60 years of age are at signifi cant risk for long-term cognitive problems, and in this group recovery from POCD may last as long as 6 months and may be permanent. Patients with POCD in all age groups are at an increased risk of all-cause death in the fi rst year after surgery. Most dizziness is benign and is self-limited. Vertigo is often described as an external sensation such as the room is spinning. Vertigo is most commonly from peripheral causes which affect labyrinths of the inner ear. Focal lesions of the brainstem and cerebellum can also lead to vertigo. Vertical nystagmus with a downward fast phase and horizontal nystagmus that changes direction with gaze suggest central vertigo. Signifi cant non-accommodating nystagmus is most often a sign of central vertigo but can occur with peripheral causes as well. In peripheral vertigo, nystagmus typically is provoked by positional maneuvers. It can be inhibited by visual fi xation. Central causes of nystagmus are more likely to be associated with hiccups, diplopia, cranial neuropathies, and dysarthria. 274. You are called to see a 43-year-old female who is 3 days postpartum.

He has done well during his hospitalization and is preparing for discharge to a skilled nursing facility. A catheter, which was placed in the emergency room, has been in for 3 days. He reports no prior incident of urinary retention. It is removed, and patient has diffi culty voiding. Which of the following would be considered an abnormal post-void residual (PVR) amount? A) 15 ml B) 50 ml C) 100 ml D) 200 ml E) 300 ml Answer: C Abnormal residual bladder volumes have been defi ned in several ways. No particular defi nition is clinically superior. Some authorities consider volumes greater than 100 mL to be abnormal. Others use a value greater than 20 % of the voided volume to indicate a high residual. In normal adults, the post-void residual volume should be less than 50 ml. Over the age of 60, a range of 50 ml to 100 ml can be seen but is not known to cause signifi cant issues. Post-void residual (PVR) volume increases with age but generally do not rise to above 100 ml unless there is some degree of obstruction or bladder dysfunction. Urinary retention is common after several days of catheter placement, particularly in males. Caution should be used when placing urinary catheters, as they are a signifi cant cause of urinary retention. Whenever possible urinary catheters should be removed. Bladder training and time may improve the retention. Some consideration may be given to starting the male patient on medications to reduce benign prostatic hypertrophy as well. Ultrasound can be used as a noninvasive means of obtaining PVR volume determinations, especially if a precise measurement is not required. The error using this formula, compared with the standard of post-void catheterization, is approximately 21 %. In patients with ascites bedside measurement by ultrasound of PVR can be inaccurate due to an inability to differentiate bladder fl uid from ascitic fl uid.",

This patient will likely be unable to take in oral nutrition for several days.. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because of its lower complication rate and proven effi cacy in pancreatitis. Enteral nutrition is provided through a feeding tube ideally placed past the ligament of Treitz so as not to stimulate the pancreas.

Early data suggested that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was benefi cial, and this traditionally has been the recommended treatment. However, more recent studies have not shown consistent benefi t with IVIG. Immediate cessation of the offending agent or possible agents is necessary. Systemic corticosteroids may be useful for the short-term treatment of SJS, but these drugs increase longterm complications and may have a higher associated mortality. Therapy to prevent secondary infections is important. In principle, the symptomatic treatment of patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome does not differ from the treatment of patients with extensive burns, and in many instances, these patients are often treated in burn wards. Future studies are required to determine the role of IVIG in the treatment of SJS. The lesions typically begin with blisters developing over target lesions with mucosal involvement. In SJS, the amount of skin detachment is between 10 and 30 % . Mortality is directly related to the amount of skin detachment with a mortality of about 10 % in SJS. Other risk factors for mortality in SJS include older age and intestinal or pulmonary involvement. The most common drugs to cause SJS are sulfonamides, allopurinol, nevirapine, lamotrigine, and aromatic anticonvulsants. 289.

A) Four-point restraints B) One 2 mg dose of intravenous lorazepam C) One 5 mg dose of oral haloperidol D) One 0.5 mg dose of oral haloperidol E) One 5 mg dose of intravenous haloperidol Answer: D Treatment of postoperative-induced delirium is a common issue confronted in the hospital setting. Delirium that causes injury to the patient or others should be treated with medications. This can be a diffi cult management issue. No medication is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of delirium. Current guidelines recommend using low-dose antipsychotics such as haloperidol. The use of benzodiazepines should be limited, unless concurrent alcohol withdrawal is present. A specifi c FDA warning has been issued for intravenous haloperidol due to the risk of torsades de pointes in 2007. Low-dose haloperidol, less than 2 mg, has a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. QTc prolongation monitoring is recommended for patients. If feasible, this patient should have had a baseline EKG as well as a follow-up EKG. Haloperidol at doses greater than 4.5 mg increases the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects and should be avoided. The surgery was uneventful.

Although tight control has been advocated in the past, current consensus guidelines recommend less stringent glycemic goals, typically between 80 and 150 mg/dL. The ultimate goal in the management of diabetic patients (DM) is to achieve outcomes equivalent to those in patients without DM. A meta-analysis of 15 studies reports that hyperglycemia increased both in-hospital mortality and incidence of heart failure in patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction. Several other studies have also demonstrated the benefi ts of glycemic control in the perioperative area. Type 2 diabetes mellitus often requires insulin while in the hospital. The requirements may be unpredictable. This may be due to the stress of hospitalization, dietary changes, glucose added to IV fl uids, and medicine interactions. Sliding scale alone has often been traditionally used in the past. However, this method of control often results in wide fl uctuations in glycemic control.

Osmotic laxatives, such as mannitol, lactulose, and sorbitol, are effective in the palliation of opioid-induced constipation. Although expert consensus supports the use of prophylactic bowel regimens in all patients taking opioids, little evidence demonstrates the effi cacy of one regimen over another. Bulk-forming laxatives increase stool volume but should be used with caution in patients with advanced cancer because they require adequate fl uid intake and physical activity to prevent exacerbation of constipation. Docusate has very little effect when given alone for opioidinduced constipation. Gastric motility is decreased in these patients and softening of the stool alone may not alleviate the symptom. In many situations, its effi cacy has been questioned. N-methylnaltrexone is used for the treatment of opioidinduced constipation in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative care, when response to laxative therapy has been insuffi cient. In this patient adding, starting and continuing with lactulose is the next step. In addition a bowel diary may be beneficial to review on her follow-up appointment.",

Rapid thrombosis of a drug-eluting stent (DES) is a catastrophic complication. The risk of stent thrombosis is increased in the perioperative setting and is strongly associated with the cessation of antiplatelet therapy. To avoid thrombosis with DES, aspirin and antiplatelet agents should be continued throughout surgery. In spite of the increased risk of bleeding, this strategy is acceptable in many types of invasive surgical procedures with no change in outcome. In situations where surgery may be needed on a semi-urgent basis in patients who have received a drug-eluding stent within 1 year and the risk of bleeding is high. In these situations, consultation with cardiology is recommended. Elective surgery with bare metal stents should be delayed for 30-90 days. ",

            "text": "Answer: A Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding affects an estimated 4.5 % of warfarin-treated patients annually and is associated with a signifi cant risk of death. These patients present a dilemma for clinicians regarding when to restart warfarin. A recent study examined patients who had GI bleeds when on warfarin. They found that warfarin therapy resumption within 1 week after a GI bleed was, after 90 days, associated with a lower adjusted risk for thrombosis and death without signifi cantly increasing the risk for recurrent GI bleeding compared to those who did not resume warfarin. The median time to restart warfarin was 4 days. From this study, a reasonable period of 7 days is suggested. 332. An 82-year-old male is admitted for communityacquired pneumonia. During the fi rst 24 h of admission, he undergoes cardiopulmonary arrest. He was subsequently successfully coded on the fl oor. The family cannot be contacted, and full resuscitation measures are taken. He is transferred to the ICU. Which of the following will characterize the patient's post-arrest clinical course? A) Increased intracranial pressure B) Intact cerebrovascular autoregulation C) Myocardial dysfunction D) Minimal infl ammatory response Answer: C The post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is an infl ammatory syndrome that best resembles sepsis. Infl ammatory mediators are released, resulting in activation of the coagulation cascade. Cerebral edema, ischemic degeneration, and impaired autoregulation characterize the brain injury pattern in the PCAS. Brain injury alone contributes greatly to overall morbidity and mortality in the resuscitated cardiac arrest patient. There is impaired autoregulation as well as impaired oxidative metabolism. There is predictable myocardial dysfunction. Myocardial dysfunction in the PCAS seems to be reversible and is characterized largely by global hypokinesis. Elevations of intracranial pressure are not prominent.",

A) Hemodialysis B) Intravenous mannitol C) Rapid infusion of intravenous 0.9 % saline D) Rapid infusion of 5 % dextrose in water E) Surgical consultation Answer: C Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome caused by extensive injury to skeletal muscle. It involves leakage of potentially toxic intracellular contents into plasma. This can occur in both the trained and non-trained athlete. This often occurs with the initiation of a new intense exercise regimen. The most severe complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). Etiologies of AKI may be related to hypovolemia, vasoconstriction, and myoglobin toxicity. Compartment syndrome of infl amed muscles may be either a complication of or the inciting cause of rhabdomyolysis. Mild diffuse swelling of muscle groups is common. Recommendations for the treatment of rhabdomyolysis include fl uid resuscitation fi rst and subsequent prevention of end-organ complications. This is best achieved with 0.9 % saline. Other measures to preserve kidney function may be considered after adequate volume has been given. Other supportive measures include correction of electrolyte imbalances. Fluids may be started at a rate of approximately 400 mL/h and then titrated to maintain a urine output of at least 200 mL/h. Treatment should continue until CPK displays a marked reduction or until the urine is negative for myoglobin. ",

A) CT scan B) Immediate surgery C) Start infl iximab D) Start intravenous hydrocortisone E) Immediate gastroenterology consult Answer: B Early surgical consultation is essential for cases of toxic megacolon (TM). Indications for urgent operative intervention include free perforation, massive hemorrhage increasing toxicity, and progression of colonic dilatation which is the case here. Most guidelines recommend colectomy if persistent dilatation is present or if no improvement is observed on maximal medical therapy after 24-72 h. The rationale for early intervention is based on a marked increase in mortality after free perforation. The mortality rate for perforated, acute toxic colitis is approximately 20 %. Some recommend providing up to 7 days of medical therapy if the patient demonstrates clinical improvement despite persistent colonic dilatation.

This patient very likely has neuromyelitis optica (NMO). She should be tested for the autoantibody marker NMO-IgG. Differentiating between NMO and MS early in the disease may be important because the prognosis and treatment of the two diseases are different. NMO is a more severe disease treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MS is often initially treated with immunomodulatory therapies, such as \u03b2-interferon and glatiramer acetate. The MRI is suggested of NMO. In typical MS, lesions are usually less than two segments in length. The NMO-IgG test is approximately 75 % sensitive and more than 90 % specifi c for NMO.",

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Exercise stress test without imaging B) Exercise stress test with nuclear imaging C) Pharmacologic stress test with nuclear imaging D) Exercise stress with echocardiography E) Cardiology consultation for catheterization F) Discharge home Answer: C This patient has atypical chest pain.

Stress testing is indicated here prior to possible cardiac catheterization. Exercising imaging tests in patients with LBBB can produce false-positive test results.

This differs from hospice care, which occurs in the patient's last 6 months of life. Reference Saito AM, Landrum MB, Neville BA, Ayanian JZ, Weeks JC, Earle CC.

A 57-year-old female with a history of endocarditis has had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for intravenous antibiotics. She presents 3 weeks after line removal with persistent, dull, aching pain in her right shoulder and swelling of her right hand. The pain worsens with exercise. The swelling is relieved with elevation. The physical exam reveals diffuse nonpitting edema of her hand. The ultrasound shows a right subclavian vein thrombosis. What is the best approach to treating her upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT)? A) Serial ultrasound alone to assess resolution of DVT B) Low-molecular-weight heparin and 1 month of warfarin, INR goal 2-3 C) Low-molecular-weight heparin and 3 months of warfarin, INR goal 2-3 D) Initiate warfarin therapy alone E) Aspirin 325 mg for 6 months Answer: C UEDVT is common secondary to increased interventions in the upper extremity. It has become more easily recognized due to improvement and availability of noninvasive ultrasound technology. UEDVT accounts for up to 10 % of all DVT. American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend treating UEDVT patients with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin with the addition of warfarin, with an INR goal of 2-3 for at least 3 months depending upon the overall clinical scenario. Two previous small studies evaluating catheter-related thrombosis reported no subsequent embolic phenomenon. However, since UEDVT has been more widely recognized, most authors are recommending three months of treatment until further studies defi ne the correct duration of treatment.

Her routine follow-up for colorectal cancer requires a follow-up CT scan of the chest and abdomen. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed and it reveals a new 1.6-cm liver mass suspicious for malignancy and a large left main pulmonary artery fi lling defect.Which of the following is the correct treatment? A) Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment dose injections B) LMWH treatment dose followed by warfarin C) LMWH 40 mg daily D) Observation alone Answer: A Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often incidentally found on computed tomography scans performed for various indications. Treatment protocols have not been established.Current guidelines recommend using the same approach as is used for patients with suspected PE. This is in accordance with American College of Chest Physicians and American Society of Clinical Oncology consensus recommendations. The recommended duration of anticoagulation for patients with cancer-related PE is 3-6 months and indefi nitely if the malignancy persists. LMWH is still the treatment of choice in this group as there are less bleeding and less recurrence than with oral vitamin K antagonists. Convenience, life expectancy and patient preference often indicate therapeutic options. References Aviram G, Levy G, Fishman JE, Blank A, Graif M.

She is currently unable to swallow solid foods. She has had fevers for the last week, with rigors starting today. Over the last 3 days, she has had increasing cough. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. On physical examination, the temperature is 39.0 \u00b0C (102.1 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 140/76 mmHg, pulse rate is 110 beats/min, and respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min. The neck is tender to palpation along the left side, without lymphadenopathy. Poor dentition is noted. The pharynx is erythematous. The chest is clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination is normal. Chest radiograph reveals multiple punctate densities.Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the diagnosis? A) Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast B) CT of the neck with contrast C) Radiography of the pharyngeal soft tissues D) Transthoracic echocardiography E) Rapid strep test Answer: B Lemierre's syndrome generally occurs in young adults. The infection usually begins with a sore throat, fever, septicemia, thrombosis, and metastatic abscesses. Poor dentition can be causative as well. This patient should undergo computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast. The diagnosis should be suspected in anyone with pharyngitis, persistent fever, neck pain, and septic pulmonary emboli. CT of the affected vessel with contrast would confi rm the diagnosis. Ultrasonography can also confi rm internal jugular vein thrombosis, showing localized echogenic regions within a dilated vessel. Treatment includes intravenous antibiotics that cover streptococci, anaerobes, and \u03b2-lactamase-producing organisms. Penicillin with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor and carbapenem are both reasonable choices. In the preantibiotic era, Lemierre's syndrome was often fatal. Vascular surgery consultation is reasonable as ligation or excision of the internal jugular vein may be required, and drainage of other abscesses near vascular tissue may be necessary.",

            "text": "However, there have been no prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical studies that have demonstrated a signifi cant benefi t with their use. 348. A 75-year-old woman who lives in a nursing facility fell and fractured her hip. She is admitted to the combined medicine orthopedic service for open reduction and internal fi xation of the hip. She was admitted for an acute myocardial infarction 5 months prior to the current admission, which was treated with angioplasty and a drug-eluting stent. Outpatient medications are omeprazole, alendronate, weekly methotrexate, aspirin (325 mg daily), clopidogrel (75 mg daily), and paroxetine. The patient's outpatient medications are continued perioperatively. The patient is placed empirically on ceftriaxone for a possible urinary tract infection. On day 3 she develops incisional bleeding at the site of her hip fracture repair site.On physical exam, temperature is 38.0 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), pulse rate is 90 beats/per minute, respirations are 22 per minute, and blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. A large hematoma with serosanguinous drainage is noted along the right hip.Which of the following medications is most likely to increase the risk of bleeding in this patient?Answer: D Perioperative use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been linked to an increased risk of bleeding, transfusion, hospital readmission, and death. Despite this, stopping SSRIs preoperatively may not be warranted. In the preoperative setting, abruptly stopping an SSRI before surgery could precipitate an SSRI withdrawal syndrome. In addition worsening of depression or other underlying conditions being treated by the drug could occur. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the risk for SSRIassociated bleeding complications.Reference Labos A. Risk of bleeding associated with combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antiplatelet therapy following acute myocardial infarction. CMAJ. 2011;183(16):1835. 349. A 62-year-old female is admitted for facial and neck cellulitis. Computed tomography of the neck in the emergency department reveals soft tissue swelling and an incidental 1.2-cm nodule on the thyroid gland, which was nonpalpable on physical examination. She responds well to antibiotics and is ready for discharge. All thyroid functions are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient? A) No further evaluation is needed. B) Repeat computed tomography of the neck in 6 months. C) Repeat computed tomography of the neck in 1 year. D) Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland. E) Thyroid uptake scan. Answer: D Current guidelines currently recommend that incidentally discovered thyroid nodules found by CT scan have the same follow-up as clinically evident nodules. Based on this patient having a greater than 1-cm thyroid nodule, the next step in the evaluation should be a diagnostic thyroid ultrasound. This can occur in the outpatient setting as it is not related to the reason for presentation.

Which of the following is the percentage of surrogate decision-makers for critically ill patients experienced bereavement in addition to the normal grieving process several months after the event? Answer: B Surrogate decision-making can place a great deal of stress on caregivers. Approximately 33 % of people who serve as surrogate decision-makers for critically ill patients experience ongoing stress that can last for months and sometimes years. A proactive and formalized approach to treating surrogate decision-makers is needed. In one pilot study, brief counseling and a brochure on bereavement signifi cantly decreased post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms and symptoms of anxiety and depression among family members. Reference Wendler D, Rid A. Systematic review: the effect on surrogates of making treatment decisions for others. Ann Intern Med. Answer: F Severe postextubation dysphagia requiring dietary modifi cation is associated with reintubation, male gender, and ventilator days. Age, weight, and place of intubation are not correlated with dysphagia. Reference Macht M et al. Postextubation dysphagia is persistent and associated with poor outcomes in survivors of critical illness.

            "text": "Answer: D In this patient, the feedings should be increased toward the goal rate. There is no correlation between gastric residual volume and the incidence of aspiration. Evidence shows that checking gastric residuals doesn't provide reliable information on tube-feeding tolerance, aspiration risk, or gastric emptying. Current guidelines recommend withholding feedings for gastric residual volumes greater than 500 mL.Answer: E This man has hematuria without evidence of dysmorphic red cells or casts in urinary sediment. Macroscopic hematuria in the absence of signifi cant proteinuria or RBC casts is an indication for imaging to exclude malignancy or cystic renal disease. Approximately 80-90 % of patients with bladder cancer present with painless gross hematuria. Urine cytology is extremely valuable but would not eliminate the need for cystoscopy, which is the standard for diagnosing bladder cancer. Many bleeding urinary tract lesions arise in the bladder and lower urinary tract, and no imaging technique is completely satisfactory for ruling out disease at these sites. Further imaging may be of use but cystoscopy will ultimately be needed. Answer: E The American College of Gastroenterology practice guidelines defi ne severe colitis as the passage of six or more stools per day with evidence of systemic toxicity. Intravenous corticosteroids, which are essential in severe cases, are effective in the induction of remission in the majority of cases. A daily intravenous steroid dose of hydrocortisone 300 mg or methylprednisolone 60 mg is suggested. Fortunately, most patients with severe UC respond to intravenous steroid therapy. However, 30 % of patients fail to respond after 5-7 days. These patients are considered to be steroid refractory. One of the simplest algorithms predicts that at the third day of intravenous steroid therapy, patients with a stool frequency of greater than eight per day or three per day plus a CRP greater than 45 mg/dl have an 85 % likelihood of requiring colectomy. Medical treatment of steroid-refractory severe UC has expanded with the availability of both cyclosporine and infl iximab as rescue agents. The need for colectomy may be reduced with the use of these agents. In addition, stool samples should be collected for culture and toxin analysis to rule out enteric infection.Answer: D Patients with -RA presenting for TKR represent those patients who have failed medical management and are a high-risk group for cervical spine involvement. Radiographic screening of RA patients presenting for joint replacement surgery reveals cervical spine instability in 44 %, which is typically asymptomatic. Lateral fl exion/extension views are more sensitive and are recommended. Cervical spine subluxation is less likely in RA patients presenting for general surgery, and there is currently no consensus on who should be screened in this population. ",
