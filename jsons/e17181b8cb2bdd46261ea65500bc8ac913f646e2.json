Hence, we sought to determine the existence of any chronic endocrine sequelae in SARS survivors. Design, patients, measurements Sixty-one survivors of SARS prospectively recruited were analysed for hormonal derangements 3 months following recovery. Patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders were excluded. Any endocrine abnormalities diagnosed were investigated and treated where indicated up to a year. Serial evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication of any endocrinological aberrations. Results Twenty-four (39\u00b73%) patients had evidence of hypocortisolism. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3\u00b73%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6\u00b77%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels. Conclusions These preliminary findings highlight a possible aetiologic role of SARS-associated coronavirus in causing a reversible hypophysitis or direct hypothalamic effect, with the HPA axis affected more frequently than the HPT axis.",

Given that the endocrinopathic properties of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is currently an inadequately explored domain, any hormonal aberrations unravelled through this preliminary investigation will contribute new scientific insights to the medical database with the potential of translating into clinically relevant therapeutic strategies for SARS-associated endocrinopathies.",

A total of 238 were infected with SARS, of whom 33 died. All survivors of probable SARS in Singapore aged 21 years and above were eligible. Those with pre-existing endocrine disorders before SARS were excluded. Out of 205 survivors, two with underlying primary hypothyroidism were excluded, and 61 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided written informed consent were prospectively enrolled about 3 months postdischarge, with the last batch of patients entered into the study by 30 September 2003 and followed up till 1 October 2004. Most of the remaining survivors not recruited did not consent for a variety of personal reasons, many of whom cited inconvenience, inability to be followed up over an extended period of 1 year or their reluctance to be subjected to laboratory investigations. A number of survivors refused to participate on grounds of being psychologically unprepared, or being in a state of grief over their deceased relatives who expired from SARS. Some remained noncontactable and could not be recruited and several were underaged individuals excluded for the purpose of this study. Using admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) as an arbitrary criterion for severe SARS, 46 were severe SARS cases admitted to the ICU of whom 20 survived; among them, eight severe SARS subjects were enrolled while 12 declined participation. Thus, among the survivors with severe SARS, 13\u00b71% (8/61) were recruited while 8\u00b73% (12/144) were not recruited. As such, more subjects with severe SARS were represented in the study cohort than those who were not entered into the study.",

Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical profile of the study population. Twenty-four (39\u00b73%) patients had hypocortisolism, of which 20 (83\u00b73%) had unequivocal central hypocortisolism as evidenced by concomitant low or inappropriately normal ACTH levels ( Table 2 ). Four (16\u00b77%) had hypocortisolism associated with plasma ACTH above the upper reference limit of 11 pmol/ l (50 pg /ml). Although this may superficially suggest primary hypocortisolism, the levels of ACTH were not elevated sufficiently to be diagnostic of primary hypocortisolism. In the absence of renin-aldosterone data and overt addisonian crisis, primary adrenal insufficiency was most unlikely, whereas secondary hypocortisolism appear to be the main form of HPA axis dysfunction encountered here. Indeed, the raised ACTH may in fact be a reflection of a recovering HPA axis following steroid-induced suppression. Among these four patients, one who was given systemic steroids during SARS was probably a case of central hypocortisolism rather than primary hypocortisolism, being recruited at a time when the hypothalamo-pituitary unit was recovering from transient HPA axis suppression, while the other three with elevated ACTH who had no steroids exposure during SARS or prior to SARS could arguably be cases of SARS-induced central hypocortisolism showing evidence of early hypothalamo-pituitary recovery rather than primary adrenal insufficiency.",

As a corroborative measure, to determine if hypocortisolism occurred during acute SARS in those steroid-na\u00efve patients without SST data, retrospective data of blood pressures recorded at the height of the febrile period were compared against that during apyrexial phase at discharge. This assumes that any patient with acute hypocortisolism developing in the midst of SARS would manifest profound hypotension. However, the average decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was modest Table 2 . SST1, SST2 and SST3 represent the sequential order (i.e. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) of the low dose short Synacthen test being performed during the followup of hypocortisolic patients. Wilcoxon signed ranked test on 30 min F between SST1 and SST2 revealed a statistically significant improvement in stimulated serum cortisols over time (P < 0\u00b7001).

Although we did not formally evaluate the spectrum of symptoms between those with normal vs. impaired HPA axis using standardized psychometric scales or instruments of health outcomes / quality of life (QoL) measurements (e.g. SF-36), only 37\u00b78% (14 / 37) of those with normal HPA axis compared with 87\u00b75% (21/24) of those with impaired HPA axis volunteered having experienced fatigue and/or orthostatic dizziness at the point of recruitment.",

Although mostly vague, nonspecific and ill-defined, these symptoms were reminiscent of the complaints seen in a host of endocrine disorders, including hypothyroidism, hypocortisolism, thyrotoxicosis, hypercalcaemia, hypopituitarism and Cushing's syndrome. Theoretically, this coronavirus can involve any organ during the viraemic phase. Because certain forms of hypophysitis, thyroiditis and adrenalitis have viral aetiologies, [6] [7] [8] it is instructive to determine the endocrinopathic impact of SARS-CoV.

            "text": "Our investigation set on record an unprecedented effort to chronicle the natural history of endocrine dysfunction, in particular that of the HPA axis, in SARS survivors for up to a year. Serial longitudinal evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication. A sizeable proportion surprisingly exhibited cortisol deficiencies rather than up-regulated HPA axis or thyroid status typical in depression and panic disorder. [11] [12] [13] In this respect, the cortisol disturbances observed are analogous to that reported in chronic fatigue syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder and primary fibromyalgia syndrome, whereby the HPA axis appears to be under-active. 14, 15 Central hypocortisolism consequent to a pathological effect of SARS rather than glucocorticoid-induced HPA axis suppression was suggested by absence of steroid use in nearly two-thirds of this group. Moreover, the transient and minimally suppressive effect on the HPA axis of the glucocorticoid regimen used is backed by those with preservation of a normal response to the low-dose SST despite having received high-dose glucocorticoids. Taken together, this implies that the HPA axis impairment is probably a delayed pathological complication post-SARS rather than merely be ascribed to suppression by exogenous steroid use. Other than mild reduction in MAP during pyrexia from SARS, the absence of overt hypotension during the acute febrile phase of SARS in survivors who developed hypocortisolism subsequently also suggests that SARS-associated hypocortisolism is a late-onset phenomenon. This is supported by evidence of those with intact HPA axis by standard dose SST during acute SARS who subsequently revealed impaired HPA axis by low dose SST at 3 months postdischarge.",

            "text": "Although speculative, the overall data are interpreted to be consistent with the hypothesis that hypocortisolism in SARS survivors develops gradually as a late complication several weeks after the onset of SARS infection. Because the majority of these patients were young (mean age 36\u00b75 years), previously healthy and had no prior corticosteroid exposure, there is a strong likelihood that the SARS-CoV was the aetiologic agent responsible for hypocortisolism. To address the integrity of the HPA axis of SARS survivors postdischarge, the low-dose 1 \u00b5 g SST was employed as it was deemed potentially more appropriate and sensitive than the 250 \u00b5 g SST in detection of any recent onset central hypocortisolism associated with minimal adrenal atrophy, in whom false negatives could result with the supraphysiological 250 \u00b5 g SST. [16] [17] [18] [19] The negative thyroid autoantibodies in all but one patient implicate SARS-CoV rather than autoimmunity as a pathogenetic mechanism causing transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Nonthyroidal illness (i.e. 'euthyroid sick syndrome') was an unlikely confounder as these patients were completely apyrexial at the time of enrolment into the study. Although no radionuclide scans or thyroid biopsies were performed, we postulate that SARS-CoV induced thyroiditis or hypophysitis, either alone or in combination, was the most probable reason for the thyroid dysfunction.",

This finding may be explained by the fact that adrenal androgen production is not solely regulated by ACTH, but also by extra-adrenal peptides including \u03b2 -endorphin and \u03b2 -lipotropin, and by an intra-adrenal neuroimmune system. 22, 23 It is possible that DHEA replacement could further ameliorate symptoms in those with DHEAS deficiency. Because of the dramatic improvement of energy level, mood and resolution of dizziness after achieving satisfactory cortisol levels, DHEA replacement was not instituted in those affected, predominantly female patients in case adverse effects outweigh its benefits. We elected not to investigate the rest of the pituitary hormones and only to focus our attention on the HPA axis and thyroid dysfunction which were better defined in postviral syndromes.",

In this regard, alterations in the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene are associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue syndrome and idiopathic chronic fatigue. 24 Coincidentally, SARS-CoV utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) 25 and a C-type lectin surface glycoprotein called L-SIGN or CD209L 26 as critical portals of cellular entry. Perhaps ACE-2 and/or CD209L could be expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary where they may play a role in postviral fatigue pathogenesis, given our data of post-SARS hypocortisolism, even though neither ACE2 nor CD209L has been shown to date to be expressed on any endocrine organ. Finally, the overall prognosis of hypocortisolism in post-SARS survivors appears favourable. Our results provide compelling evidence that the HPA and HPT axes are candidate targets of SARS-CoV. Pending future SARS epidemics, adequately powered clinical studies to clarify this could prove daunting. In vitro studies and animal models of SARS might better define the endocrine lesions.",

Because the treatment protocol for critically ill SARS patients managed in the ICU included the use of high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, HPA axis suppression as a cause of central hypocortisolism from exogenous steroid exposure remains a possibility. Of the 24 patients with hypocortisolism, six received systemic glucocorticoids during SARS while one was an asthmatic on inhaled corticosteroids. Among the six patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids, three were on prednisolone up to a dose of 60 mg given for 2-5 days; the other three patients had intravenous methylprednisolone 200 mg for 3 days, followed by hydrocortisone 100 mg 8 hourly for about a week before being switched to oral prednisolone tapered over 10 days. Notably, the majority (18 patients) of those with hypocortisolism were glucocorticoid na\u00efve. Four of six patients treated with high-dose parenteral glucocorticoids who escaped hypocortisolism post-SARS demonstrated the lack of prolonged suppression on the HPA axis with the corticosteroid regimen and doses utilized.",
