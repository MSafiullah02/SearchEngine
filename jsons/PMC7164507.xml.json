            "text": "Mechanical ventilation is an indispensable tool for the survival of critical care patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury (ALI). However, the mortality rates of these diseases remains high, approximately 40% (1). In addition, it is widely known that the use of mechanical ventilation is itself the cause of a number of further associated complications (2), which are collectively termed ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). This is despite the more recent adoption of modern protective ventilation strategies, where lower tidal volumes are administered while retaining a positive pressure at the end of expiration, which increases lung functional residual capacity and alveolar recruitment. These protocols improve the situation considerably over conventional ventilation (3\n4\n5). However, there are competing ventilator strategies each with their own merits and drawbacks, for example, the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) required by the patient (6\n7). Biologically, these aforementioned ventilator related diseases manifest themselves at the alveolar level and are characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma, albeit still much controversy surrounds the precise mechanisms (8). VILI can be characterized into separate but not mutually exclusive protocol dependent mechanisms: these are volutrauma (alveolar overdistension), atelectotrauma (recruitment-derecruitment), and biotrauma (inflammation) (9). Predisposition to these conditions is brought about by heterogeneous lung mechanics when the patient is suffering from ARDS or ALI (9), for example, the functional capacity of a diseased lung can be reduced resulting in alveolar overdistension (10). Mortality is usually caused via indirect mechanisms resulting from VILI (11) in which a cascade of events leads to sepsis or multiple organ failure. Understanding the reason why the lungs still become damaged or inflamed during mechanical ventilation is a key question sought by the medical community.",

Of particular interest are what conditions within the lung mechanically differ under both diseased and healthy conditions. Currently, a number of limitations exist for modeling the lower airways (in this paper lower airways and higher generations are used synonymously to mean peripheral vessels). First the resolution of CT imaging is restricted (maximum 0.5 mm resolution), hence, smaller vessels are not visible for segmentation. Second, even if the entire lung was fully segmentable, currently, it is not computationally feasible to simulate the full lung tree. Due to these points, alternative methods for modeling the lung must be sought.",

            "text": "There has been considerable work in the area of lung impedance, specifically related to 1D transmission line models (22\n23\n24\n25). Impedance of the lung is an extremely important phenomenon as it plays a central role in the development and distribution of lung disease. More specifically, the heterogeneity of lung disease is brought about by changes in impedance conditions within the lung. These changes further affect how flow and pressure distribute through the lung. The aforementioned impedance models assume 1D fluid mechanics throughout the entire lung. However, from previous 3D simulations it is well known that the flow in the upper portion of the lower airways is not accurately modeled with 1D equations since typical bifurcating flow phenomena, such as flow recirculation, exist. For this reason, a fully coupled 1D-3D approach must be used and is hence developed in this paper. The developed impedance is based on an asymmetric structured tree methodology as introduced and used for blood in Refs. 26\n27\n28. This cited work has been modified in order to represent the physiological environment in the pulmonary tree. The coupling of the 1D model to the 3D model is achieved utilizing a Dirichlet to Neumann approach introduced in Ref. 29 for arterial blood flow. The aim of this paper is to apply this modeling approach to lung simulations and also to study the mechanics of the lung under artificial ventilation. In particular, using such an approach, the entire conducting airway can be modeled efficiently obtaining important pressure and flow information.",

This 1D approach is modified in order to model the pulmonary tree rather than the peripheral arterial tree. In order to calculate the impedance of the pulmonary tree, the airways are modeled as 1D flexible elastic tubes. To achieve this, the linearized 1D fluid momentum equation is used and is given by\n3\u2202u\u2202t+1\u03c1\u2202p\u2202x=\u03bdr\u2202\u2202r(r\u2202u\u2202r)where u is the velocity in the streamwise direction, t time, \u03c1 density, \u03bd viscosity, and r the radius of the vessel. The approximation of linearized 1D momentum is reasonable for the pulmonary tree due to the high wave speed. In addition to the momentum equation, we also have the 1D continuity equation\n4C\u2202p\u2202t+\u2202q\u2202x=0where p is the pressure, q is the flowrate, and C is the vessel compliance, which is given by the following linearized state equation (22).\n5C=2\u03c0r3Ehwith r as the vessel radius, E as the elastic modulus, and h as the wall thickness.

This method has the advantage of being mathematically well posed and has proven to be numerically stable. In addition, it also has the advantage that the solution of 1D and 3D domain is achieved simultaneously. The method was implemented both explicitly and implicitly into our finite element CFD code, however, little difference was observed between the methods and the explicit version was utilized due to the faster solution times. In brief, given the downstream domain pressure, p\u2217(t) (obtained from the impedance model), the time dependent pressure at the outflow of the 3D domain can be represented by\n12p(t)=\u222b\u0393sw(p\u2217I~\u2212\u03c4~)\u22c5ndswhere \u0393s is the outflow boundary surface, w is a weighting function, I~ is the identity tensor, \u03c4~ is the viscous stress tensor, and n is the outward normal. The second term (\u03c4~) is assumed to be zero, which inherently assumes that the flow is fully developed (\u03c4~=0). To satisfy this condition, the outlets of the 3D model are extruded. All outlet extrusions were deemed suitably long such that the observed profile was parabolic and streamwise independent. Furthermore, the effect that these extensions have on the pressure is minimal. This was further verified using the traction free condition with and without the extensions and comparing the pressure at the equivalent location. Finally, the use of these pressure based boundary conditions, in particular, how the flow distributes, was verified by looking at the mean flow division ratio as a percentage of the inlet flow. The following distribution was obtained: right lobe (57%), left lobe (42%), right superior lobe (19%), right middle lobe (10%), right inferior lobe (28%), left superior lobe (24%), and left inferior lobe (18%). These flow divisions were deemed suitable based on reported literature values (16). The major advantage of this method is that no assumption needs to be made about the flow, hence, flow distribution is completely governed by the downstream region. Further validation was provided by considering the pressure drop calculated with this coupled approach, we considered the pressure drop over the whole model for the varying flowrates. This instantaneous drop was approximately 33 Pa for a flowrate of 0.5 l/s; if we consider the equivalent values reported in literature (36), the value shows good agreement. The bronchial pressure drop over the acceleratory phase is given in Fig.4.",

The current impedance model has the advantage that no a priori assumptions need to be made about the flow since the flow in the 3D domain is governed by the peripheral vessels. This is a major advantage over previous impedance implementations. Here, we consider a light constriction of the left superior lobe, i.e., a lung of reduced functional residual capacity. This could represent clinical scenarios such as alectasis or a derecruited region of the lung. This model is only indicative and is not meant to reproduce the complex nature of true lung disease since lung disease formation tends to be heterogeneous. The constriction of the airways is modeled by increasing the impedance on the outlets. Here, the model responds by letting less flow into this lobe and naturally diverting flow to other regions of the lung. This shows that with our method we can simulate heterogeneous changes in the lung. Furthermore, considering Fig.10, the pressure-flow relationship is only really affected in the vicinity of the occlusion. In Figs. 10a\n10b, it is evident that there is a widening of the loop (hysteresis) indicating an increase in the phase difference between pressure and flow. However, in other parts of the lung the relationship remains very similar (between disease and undiseased scenarios). This suggests the response is quite local, i.e., pressure and flow is increased throughout the lung, however, the dynamic between the two remains similar.",

Ultimately geometry is the major factor in the resulting flow distribution, however, the rapid deceleration observed late in the inspiratory phase results in larger recirculation zones forming in the higher generations. The flowrate difference between the two different boundary conditions shows very similar profiles (data not shown). In addition, the instantaneous flowrate difference is maximal 4% higher under impedance conditions. The most notable change between standard traction free and impedance outflow conditions is again the pressure distribution, both temporally and spatially. In particular the max pressure difference between the two different boundary conditions at peak inspiration is 27% in the second generation (traction free condition is 27% lower than impedance). The observed temporal gradients in pressure are interestingly high in the higher generations, however, the dynamics tended to be similar. This effect is driven by the nonuniform geometry.",

Interestingly in the left lobe of the lung, the pressure over the cycle in the third generation is higher than in the second. This is driven by the flow route, more air is diverted into the left superior lobe, where the pressure is reduced (data not shown). This results in less air flowing into the left inferior lobe. The flow route is primarily driven by the curvature of the second generation of the left hand side of the lung, where the air is skewed toward the interior surface of the lung, hence flow continuity results in secondary currents, which lead to flow diverting back toward the anterior surface. This aforementioned phenomenon is primarily due to the nonuniformity of the geometry, meaning the cross-sectional area change plays an important role in the pressure and flow distribution. This particularly suggests that models based around circular cross sections fail to capture essential dynamics such as pressure variations due to cross-sectional changes.",

This is evidenced by the pressure-flow loop area increase, hence indicating that inertial effects are important (pressure is leading flow). This relationship is also seen to be much more nonlinear. This is specifically true during the acceleration phases. The small lag that does occur comes about due to transient fluid inertia, which results directly from higher slew rates observed during this ventilation protocol. Ultimately the flow in the lung can be characterized as quasi-steady (Womersley numbers \u223c1), which means the flow responds to the changing pressure gradient in a very rapid fashion. Both boundary conditions, under mechanical ventilation, exhibit phase differences; this indicates that the upper generations contribute more dominantly to the lung impedance than the peripheral vessels, this is also backed up by the dynamics being not significantly different. However, the peripheral vessels are obviously important for correct pressure distribution/level in the lower generations, as indicated by the large difference between pressure levels.",

Furthermore, the method is applied in a mathematically well posed formulation, i.e., avoiding a full Dirichlet problem. Currently the impedance model is based purely around a structured tree, however, the present implementation allows essentially any tree to be attached to the end of the 3D domain, for example, a tree developed from a space filling algorithm (37).",

The high slew rate ventilation curve resulted in larger recirculation zones in higher generations, particularly during the deceleration phase. The higher frequencies of the mechanical ventilation profile led to a different pressure-flow dynamic, in particular during the rapid acceleration/deceleration phase and where the flow became slightly negative (compare Fig. 11). The wider pressure-flow loop indicates a phase lag between pressure and flow; this is in contrast to normal breathing, where the pressure and flow remain essentially in phase. This different dynamic is due to the effects of transient fluid inertia. However, generally the flow in the lungs is quasi-steady since there is only a small lag between pressure and flow, i.e., flow responds rapidly to the changing pressure gradient. This is to be expected given the Womersley number is only marginally above one for the lower generations and below one for higher generations.",

The fact that the impedance does not change the flow magnitude significantly suggests that models, which are interested in flow related phenomena only, such as particle distribution, potentially do not require such complicated impedance type boundary conditions. At the very least, such simulations can consider only resistance at the outlet terminals. However, in making such an assumption, a significant number of generations must be considered in the model in order to capture the relevant pressure-flow dynamics, i.e., the impedance is predominantly from the upstream area of the model. This is supported by previous medical observations, where it is reported that around 10% of the resistance comes from the small airways (39\n40). From a flow physics perspective, this does not mean the number of generation levels, rather it requires that the Reynolds number at the outlet is sufficiently low.",

Understanding how the lungs respond under mechanical ventilation is currently an unresolved question still trying to be elucidated by the medical community (41). Here, a partial obstruction of the superior left lobe was investigated in order to see the effects on the rest of the lung. This simulation also demonstrated the usefulness of the coupling method, where no assumption is made a priori about the flow into the peripheral airways, i.e., the flow is realistically governed by the impedance in this downstream region. The obstruction was not meant to model the complexity of lung disease but instead see the effects of the peripheral vessels on the lung dynamics. However, it could be indicative of a downstream derecruited region. The results demonstrated for both normal breathing and mechanical ventilation that the major changes in pressure-flow dynamics tended to be localized to the vicinity of the region, where the constricted vessels are located, i.e., the other regions of the lung showed increased pressure and flow, however, the relationship between the variables is virtually unchanged. In these other regions, the mean outlet pressure was on average approximately 28% higher, which could potentially result in overdistension (volutrauma) of the downstream alveoli due to elevated lobular pressure. The model here, although completely idealized, demonstrates that diseased lungs respond differently to healthy lungs. Further work is required in this area to understand heterogeneous lung disease. This model represents a step in the direction to understand the complex lung mechanics occurring during mechanical ventilation. One of the major areas, which requires understanding is the effect of different mechanical maneuvers on lung mechanics in a diseased state.",

Although these two methods provide some useful insights into flow structures in the conducting airways our approach has a number of advantages: We can model the whole conducting airway utilizing a realistic geometry for the first seven generations and then attach 1D trees as boundary conditions onto the 3D domain; the 1D domain takes into account the effects of wall movement; we are utilizing transient simulations; and we have a framework in which we have demonstrated that we can model diseased state conditions.",

In particular significant changes are expected to be seen in the higher generations due to the reduced wall cartilage content. Currently the 1D model is attached to the outlet of the 3D model obtained from the CT data, future models will include artificial bifurcations based on morphological data to extend the 3D model a few extra generations, this is in order to limit any error associated with using a 1D model. Ultimately, we are working toward a whole lung model, hence, work is currently being undertaken to couple the model presented here to models of the alveolar region (44\n34), therefore we will have a model of the tracheobronchial tree coupled to the acinar region. This is expected to alter the results since this is a major part of the respiratory system. This is in the hope that further understanding of the lung, specifically the alveoli under healthy and diseased conditions can be ascertained.
