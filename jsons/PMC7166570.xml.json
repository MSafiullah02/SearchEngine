This orangutan family group was provided both indoor and outdoor housing. The outdoor yards consisted of natural substrates, while the indoor housing was composed of artificial trees, concrete rockwork, fire\u2010hoses, hammocks, and platforms for climbing and various enrichments for mental stimulation in compliance with USDA requirements. The orangutans were also provided wood wool, hay, blankets, and browse. The orangutans were fed a balanced diet overseen by a PhD\u2010certified nutritionist which was provided in variable ways day\u2010to\u2010day including during training sessions, in enrichment devices, via scatter\u2010feeding, etc. Oral amoxicillin (10 mg/kg mg BID, 50 mg/mL suspension; Virbac AH, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) and acetaminophen (10 mg/kg BID, 32 mg/mL suspension; McNeil Consumer Healthcare, Fort Washington, PA, USA) were given on the day of presentation. Initial improvement was documented, but on the second day, the infant was less active and slow to nurse. Coughing was no longer noted but the depth of respirations was increased in sternal recumbency.",
