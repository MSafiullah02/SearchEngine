            "text": "Three quarters of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses; diseases that are transmissible between vertebrate animals and humans (Taylor et al., 2001). The management of such diseases usually benefits from a One Health multidisciplinary approach as it requires the collaboration of veterinary and medical professionals to mitigate biosecurity and public health risks. Many zoonoses have been known for decades or even centuries (e.g., Q fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, salmonellosis) while others have only been recently recognised (emerging zoonotic diseases). Some emerging zoonoses spill over into humans and progress no further. Others spill over and succeed in making the next transition into human-to-human dissemination, becoming a major threat to human health (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), swine influenza H1N12009, Ebola virus). Although some of the emerging zoonoses that remain confined to the first generation of human victims have a low-incidence, they remain a public health threat because of the severity of their pathogenicity in humans (Belay and Monroe, 2014). Hendra virus (HeV) is a good example of such a zoonosis. It emerged in humans in Australia in 1993 after spilling over from flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) to horses to humans (Murray et al., 1995a, Murray et al., 1995b, Halpin et al., 2000, Halpin et al., 2011). Since its emergence it has remained a uniquely Australian zoonosis where 49 equine outbreaks have occurred on the eastern coast between Far North Queensland (QLD) and Northern New South Wales (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Queensland (DAFF QLD), 2014). During this time, 91 horses have been suspected of HeV infection, 71 of which were confirmed positive; while only seven people have been infected (Murray et al., 1995a, Murray et al., 1995b, O'Sullivan et al., 1997, Hanna et al., 2006, Field et al., 2010, Playford et al., 2010, Mahalingam et al., 2012, DAFF QLD, 2014). Compared to pandemic Influenza and SARS, HeV could be considered a minor threat to public health. However, HeV has a 57.1% case fatality rate in humans and all four who died of HeV had professional or direct caring roles for the ill horses. Two were equine veterinarians, one was a person assisting a veterinarian during a horse necropsy, and one was a horse trainer. Another veterinarian, a veterinary nurse, and a stable hand also became infected with HeV but survived. Those who became infected with HeV, did so through close exposure to infectious blood and/or other bodily fluids such as respiratory secretions from an infected horse (Animal Health Australia, 2013, DAFF QLD, 2014). Currently there is no cure available for those who become infected with HeV. A human monoclonal antibody has been shown to neutralise HeV in primates and has been used as experimental prophylaxis in humans but it is not currently licenced or available commercially (Bossart et al., 2011).",

In 2010, all private veterinarians registered with the Veterinary Surgeons Board of Queensland (VSBQ) received a comprehensive information package about HeV and its management (DAFF QLD, 2010). Up until 2011, the prevention of HeV was solely based on avoiding exposure, through contact with horses potentially infected with the virus, by implementing adequate infection control (IC) measures such as following hygiene and quarantine protocols and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In October 2012 a new HeV vaccine for horses was also released and promoted as a One Health measure that would protect both horses and the people coming into contact with horses, and in particular horse owners and veterinary personnel (Pallister et al., 2011a, Pallister et al., 2011b, Animal Health Australia, 2013, Middleton et al., 2014). However, after more than a year in circulation the vaccine uptake seems to have been moderate despite the initial motivation of veterinarians to encourage horse owners to vaccinate their horses (Mendez et al., 2013a, DPI NSW, 2013. Veterinary IC therefore remains a major component of the management of HeV in private practices providing equine veterinary services.",

ARIA categories are based on the road distance from the closest service centres (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2004). Moreover, participants were asked how often they used PPE depending on the health status of a horse: a healthy horse (HH); a sick horse (SH); or when they were conducting a necropsy on a dead horse (NH). Participants were also asked to detail which items of PPE they used in each of the different horse health scenarios as well as in the case a horse was suspected to be infected with HeV (HeVH). Participants could choose PPE items from 9 different types of PPE: body (overalls, gown or apron), head (hat), feet (gumboots or boot covers), oro-nasal only (surgical mask, surgical mask with fluid barrier or particulate mask [N95/P2]), oro-nasal and ocular (surgical mask with eye shield or face shield), ocular only (goggles), hand (gloves or arm length gloves) PPE; dressing to cover open wounds or skin abrasions; and powered air respirator (PAR).

This may be less a reflection on the level of commitment of equine veterinarians to HeV mitigation than a reflection of the overall IC and zoonoses management strategies in place in these practices. It may also be an indication that IC for the management of HeV is mostly understood by veterinarians as being the usage of PPE. Similar observations were made during the 2009\u20132010 qualitative study amongst QLD veterinarians. Infection control in veterinary practices across Australia has been shown to be less than optimal even in specialised equine practices where the risk of exposure to HeV is highest (Leggat et al., 2009, WHS QLD, 2011b, Dowd et al., 2013). The present study showed a lack of IC related equipment in veterinary practices providing services to equine patients. However, some participants may have misinterpreted questions on this topic as most worked in mixed practices which may only have had clinical premises for attending to small domestic animals while large animals may have been mostly seen in the field. Furthermore, other HeV management plan items such as \u201cstaff HeV training record keeping system\u201d and \u201cHeV related occupational health and safety reporting system\u201d may not have been regarded as essential to the practical management of a suspected HeV case as they related to WHS proof of compliance. These items would only be required if a human under WHS veterinary responsibility became exposed to HeV. Compiling and keeping WHS proof of compliance has previously been reported to be burdensome for private veterinary practices to the point that in some cases equine practice was abandoned because the level of liability became too high (Mendez et al., 2012a).",

Most kits included most items except PPE for head protection; dressings for wound and skin abrasions; and PAR. It is worth noting that the use of PAR, highly recommended by WHS authorities as the best way to avoid exposure to HeV, is still very low in private practice when dealing with horses, including those suspected of HeV.

Male veterinarians may have been attending to horses more regularly or may have been carrying out more risky procedures than female veterinarians which would explain their different approach to PPE usage in this case. However, this difference in PPE usage by gender was not carried over in the other scenarios with SH, NH and HeVH patients. The number of veterinarians who always or sometimes used PPE and the amount of PPE used by participants increased as the health status of horses deteriorated. It is likely that veterinarians were making PPE choices according to their perceptions and assessments of the infectious risks involved. Risk perception and risk assessment were not the only factors determining PPE usage. Veterinarians in highly accessible and accessible ARIA regions were more likely to use PPE when examining a healthy horse. This may be because most of the highly to accessible ARIA regions were located in the known geographic distribution range of HeV in QLD; i.e., coastal areas between Far North QLD and South East QLD (DAFF QLD, 2014). Veterinarians in less accessible, inland areas may have perceived the risk of being exposed to HeV as low or were less used to take HeV risks into consideration. The use of PPE by these veterinarians may have also been influenced by the different nature of their clientele. Horse owners from the racing industry were reported to react differently to the veterinary use of PPE than horse owners in rural areas (Mendez et al., 2012b). Rural clients often had different cost benefit expectations of veterinary service provided than other clients and/or viewed the systematic use of PPE by veterinarians negatively (Mendez et al., 2012b).",

Thus, QLD graduates may have received more formal and practical education about HeV during their undergraduate studies. This may have changed since 2011. However, if discrepancies were to remain, they potentially could put young graduates from other states at a higher risk of exposure to HeV. Early career veterinarians tend to have more than one employer within the first 2 years after graduation while some do not stay in the state they graduated from (Heath, 2008).

Alternatively, those who had already had experience with HeV or HeV management may have been more receptive to the government's campaigns and more motivated to implement the appropriate measures. Participants who rarely or never used PPE with healthy horses and had no experience with HeV or had not sought training or management planning may also have thought that the lack of clinical signs in a horse patient was likely to indicate a low risk of HeV exposure. However, experimentally infected horses have been shown to excrete viral particles at least 48 h before the onset of the first clinical signs, but this was not known until 2011 (Marsh et al., 2011).",

However, of the 49 outbreaks that have occurred to date, over a third happened in the winter of 2011 (17/49), and more than half of the 2011 outbreaks occurred in QLD (10/17) (DAFF QLD, 2014). Despite this increase in HeV outbreaks there were no cases of human infection during this time. The uncharacteristic higher number of HeV outbreaks in 2011 may have increased the relevance of HeV risk for veterinarians in QLD who in turn adopted HeV management strategies more readily during this time. Their improved management of HeV may also be the result of a better understanding of the HeV related risks and HeV risk mitigation strategies by the veterinary profession; an improved support from government to veterinarians in the field as recommended by the Ombudsman in 2011 (Clarke, 2011, Queensland Government, 2011); and a better collaboration of government authorities with private veterinarians. However, since 2011 the number of outbreaks per year has greatly decreased and motivation to sustain HeV management strategies may have changed.",

Hence, practical knowledge about HeV risk and risk mitigation appear to act as a stronger motivator than state wide education campaign promoted by Biosecurity QLD. This concurs with studies conducted in human healthcare settings where the role of education in the adoption of IC measures by health professional was not as strong as expected (Ward, 2011). This should be taken into consideration when devising professional education programmes about the management of specific diseases to increase the effectiveness of these programmes.",

Private veterinarians in QLD were very favourable to the HeV vaccine for horses prior to its introduction (Mendez et al., 2013a). The HeV vaccine has since been promoted as essential to the prevention of HeV in horses and their carer which may give a false sense of safety to veterinarians as not all horses in QLD and NWS have yet been vaccinated (DPI NSW, 2013). The effect of the HeV vaccine release on the veterinary profession's commitment to IC for the management of HeV should be evaluated in the future.",

However, not all participants answered all questions. Although 12.5% may seem a low level of response, this percentage does not represent the true response rate as the total number of private veterinarians providing equine services in QLD and therefore the true response rate could not be calculated. According to the 2009 president of the QLD division of the Australian Veterinary Association, the Equine Veterinarians Association counted 219 members which however did not include all equine veterinarians in the state of QLD (Dr, B. Pott, personal communication). Furthermore, a 2004 study estimated that equine veterinary services were provided by 12% of all Australian veterinarians (Heath, 2004). Assuming these results were also representative of the veterinary population in QLD in 2011, the 200 veterinarians who participated in the present study may in fact represent a high proportion of the total number of veterinarians providing equine services in QLD. Another potential limiting factor to this study was that the private veterinary workforce in QLD had been under high scrutiny from the government in 2010 in relation to IC and HeV management (WHS QLD, 2011b). As a result, eligible veterinarians may have elected to decline participation in another investigative exercise into their practice; while those who chose to participate may have altered their responses in order to show a higher level of compliance with government recommendations in regards to IC/HeV management. Although it is difficult to gauge the validity of the results, the responses given by participating veterinarians in this study corroborate some of the findings from an exploratory qualitative study conducted by the authors in 2009\u20132010 (Mendez et al., 2012a, Mendez et al., 2012b, Mendez et al., 2013b).",

This may indicate that QLD veterinarians were protecting themselves and/or managing HeV better than in the preceding years. The unusual epidemiology of HeV during this time may have served as a motivation boost for the veterinary profession and biosecurity authorities to improve HeV management. It also tested the newly developed HeV management strategies put in place by Biosecurity QLD from 2010 onwards: better flow of information and support in the field to veterinarians and horse owners. The results of this study seem to confirm that private veterinarians can better fulfil their biosecurity, public health and WHS roles, when dealing with emerging zoonoses such as HeV, when supported by the relevant authorities. This should be taken into consideration when devising strategies to manage future emerging zoonoses. However, despite the improved HeV management support provided by government authorities to the veterinary profession in QLD, HeV management strategies and behaviours were not found to be optimal across all participants and their practices, leaving some veterinarians at risk of exposure to HeV. The uptake of improved veterinary IC strategies by the private veterinarians may therefore depend upon other factors, such as risk perception, which should be further investigated. Moreover, until the HeV vaccine coverage of equine populations is consistently high across QLD and Northern NSW; IC, including the use of appropriate PPE, remains the best course of action to prevent human exposure to HeV. Therefore, HeV-related risk information and risk mitigation communication to veterinarians and horse owners need to remain a priority of the overall HeV management plan at the State and National levels. This should include regular updates about HeV to the veterinary profession, particularly advances in knowledge; education of horse owners; practical HeV management education to veterinarians; and the consistent education of undergraduate veterinary students Australia wide. The determinants of veterinary IC should also be further investigated in particular the role of undergraduate and professional education.",
