Ventilatorassociated pneumonia is defined as pneumonia in those patients who have been intubated for at least two to three days, with worsening radiographic features, increasing secretions, bronchospasm, or hemoptysis, or with worsening status on the ventilator. While early treatment is essential, rapid de-escalation of antibiotics in the face of negative culture results is also important. Sampling of the respiratory tract is necessary to further guide management and noninvasive sampling is preferred [1]. Samples may be obtained either through tracheobronchial aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage, mini-BAL, or protected specimen brush (PSB). Careful observation of individual hospitals' bacterial antibiogram is essential to provide treatment targeted to the resistance profile of each institution. The most common MDR pathogens include P. aeruginosa, Escheriochia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acinetobacter species as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [2].", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Question What is this patient's diagnosis?"}, {"text": "A high suspicion for VAP followed by rapid diagnosis and treatment is critically important.

Treatment escalation did not change the risk of death in this single-center study [3] . Unfortunately, treatment is often delayed.
