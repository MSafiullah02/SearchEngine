In 2011, 1.3 million episodes of pneumonia were fatal in children under 5 years of age [Nair et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2013]. Pakistan is one of the 15 countries in the world that accounts for more than 60% of the worldwide disease burden of pneumonia [Liu et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2013]. Although developing countries such as Pakistan have the greatest burden of pneumonia, national data available on epidemiology and etiology of pneumonia is based on studies published over 2 decades ago [Selwyn, 1990]. Since then, diagnostic modalities and treatments have evolved. Widespread introduction of several vaccines in national immunization programs has reduced and modified the current etiologies of infectious diseases, including etiologies of pneumonia [Measham et al., 2006; Theodoratou et al., 2010]. The modern nucleic acid based molecular diagnostic methods can capture viral respiratory pathogens and with greater specificity and sensitivity than previously possible [Weinberg et al., 2004; Mahony, 2008; Caliendo, 2011].",

All of the families were provided contact details for the study physician in case their child experienced any respiratory symptoms at any time throughout the study period. These episodes of ARIs were subsequently recorded by the mobile medical teams. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected by trained study physicians from the eligible subjects who demonstrated symptoms of severe pneumonia. While NP swabs were collected at all eligible severe pneumonia episodes, blood samples were collected for culture and bio\u2010banking from febrile patients only. Treatment and/or referral to a nearby healthcare clinic or hospital was offered to all subjects whether they participated in the study or not. Deaths were recorded by community health workers. Verbal autopsy questionnaires were filled for all deceased children under 2 years of age and reviewed by one independent and trained study physician.",

It is the first study in Pakistan to utilize molecular diagnostic tests to prospectively determine the burden and seasonality of multiple respiratory viruses including coronaviruses, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and human bocavirus in community setting. In this study population, the incidence of laboratory confirmed viral\u2010associated severe pneumonia in children <2 years old was 11.9 episodes per 100 child\u2010years, which was considerably lower than the detection rate reported in a study conducted on inpatient and outpatient wards of children less than 5 years old in rural Kenya (56 cases per 100 child\u2010years) with active community surveillance [Feikin et al., 2012]. However, the number of pneumonia episodes recorded in our study was higher than that reported from a hospital\u2010based study with active population surveillance conducted in rural Bangladesh (50.5 hospitalizations per 100,000 patient\u2010weeks) [Nasreen et al., 2014].

RSV and parainfluenza virus type III were less prevalent in this study than those conducted in other regions of the world, such as in hospital\u2010based studies in rural Madagascar and China and in urban slums of Brazil [Weigl et al., 2007; Bezerra et al., 2011; Feikin et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013]. The NP specimen positivity rate for at least one pathogen in this study was higher or at par compared to other countries in the region. For example, a tertiary hospital\u2010based study of children under 14 years of age in India reported 45.7% NP swab positivity rate [Singh et al., 2014]. The aforementioned study in Bangladesh reported NP swab positivity rates of 52% in hospitalized patients and 55% in non\u2010hospitalized patients, while a previous study following a birth cohort of children for 2 years reported that 77% of pneumonia episodes were associate with a respiratory virus [Homaira et al., 2012; Nasreen et al., 2014].

This low positivity rate may possibly be due to prior antibiotic use. There were just two cultures positive for S. pneumoniae. Although Pakistan introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) in October 2012 in its Expanded Programme for Immunization, the limited rollout at that time was unlikely to affect subsequent bacterial detection in this study; the overall impact of the limited rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine in Pakistan is still under investigation [GAVI, 2012; Ali, 2014].",

This study was a community\u2010based surveillance conducted in a rural area of Pakistan, as opposed to most other studies of pneumonia etiology that have been hospital\u2010based and/or conducted in urban settings. This study helps bridge the gap since the 1980s\u2019 Board of Science and Technology for International Development (BOSTID) studies determining the epidemiology of ARIs, which included surveillance in Pakistan albeit in a different region [Selwyn, 1990]. Limitations of this study include its observational cohort design as opposed to a case\u2010control study, which makes it difficult to determine whether these viruses are truly responsible for the symptoms, or whether they are detectable in healthy children as well in that area. Viral detection does not necessarily have a causal association with acute illness. Presence of respiratory viruses in controls has been reported in many other similar studies in the literature, and lack of viral testing from asymptomatic children in our study is a limitation [Mathisen et al., 2010; Singleton et al., 2010; Feikin et al., 2012; Hammitt et al., 2012]. The Luminex assay used in this study, similar to most other commercial assays was unable to distinguish between enterovirus and rhinovirus, hence, the results were grouped together as enterovirus/rhinovirus.",

Respiratory viruses are frequently detected at the time of these pneumonia episodes, though causal association cannot be established based on this study. The role of bacterial co\u2010infections in these cases cannot be completely ruled out. Nonetheless, it appears that prevention of viruses whether through vaccines or other measures is likely to reduce the burden of pneumonia irrespective of the fact whether these viruses cause the infection alone or as an inciting event for a secondary infection to occur.",
