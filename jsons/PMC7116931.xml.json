            "text": "During the process of economic and social globalization in the 21st century, the world is undergoing an unheard-of period of crisis so far. A substantial emergency events arose, such as September 11 attacks in 2001, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, Tianjin explosion accident in 2015, Jiuzhai Valley earthquake in 2017, and so on, which demolished the country or the society involving massive humans, material resources, economic, or local environment. The influences of the emergency incidents ordinarily beyond the ability of the affected country or society to dispose of its own resources. As a consequence, the topic about emergency response has touched off the heated discussions in recent times (Ren, Xu, & Hao, 2017). Emergency decision making, one of the significant domains in the emergency response, is urgent to be explored by building the decision making techniques to polish up the efficiency and productiveness of the emergency response, which can enormously reduce the casualties, environment disruption and the economic losses. Every barber knows that one of the momentous characters of the emergency response is timeliness, which implies that the rescue forces are required for taking impactful actions in the short time. Meanwhile, for the time-starved in the emergency response, there exists much uncertain and unknown information. Under such circumstance, the experts make decisions with a great power in distinguishing the optimal alternative rather than in low differentiated alternatives. Furthermore, the indeterminacies of the emergency circumstance determine that the experts can\u2019t offer the precise decision making information when they confront diverse choices. While a wide diverse of the existing theories such as theory of fuzzy set (Zadeh, 1965), theory of probability, and theory of rough set (Pawlak, 1982) have been initiated to simulate vagueness. Each of these theories has its inherent insufficiencies as pointed out in (Molodtsov, 1999) nevertheless. The theory of soft set (SS), poineered by Molodtsov (Molodtsov, 1999), has come fresh from the deficiency of the parameterization tools of those groundbreaking theories (Pawlak, 1982, Zadeh, 1965). It has potential applications in diverse fields such as rule mining (Feng, Cho, Pedrycz, Fujita, & Herawan, 2016), game theory (Deli & \u00c7a\u011fman, 2016), feature selection (Yang, Xiao, Xu, Wang, & Pan, 2016), decision making (Akta\u015f & \u00c7a\u011fman, 2016), parameter reduction (Xie, 2016).",

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to tackle the three challenges mentioned above by developing three MCDM approaches to managing evaluation information for IVFSSs, which not only have a great power in distinguishing the optimal alternative, but also can obtain an optimal alternative out of counterintuitive phenomena and parameter selection problems. The decision making methods are shown in the following.(1)Weighted Distance Based Approximation (WDBA), poineered by Rao and Singh (2012), measures the distance from the optimal point (best value of alternatives) and non-optimal point (worst value of alternatives). Finally, the alternatives are ranked by their suitability index (SI). The alternative having the least value of SI is ranked at first position and with the maximum value at last. WDBA approach has already been applied in many fields such as E-learning websites selection (Garg and Jain, 2017, Jain et al., 2016), COTS component selection (Garg, Sharma, & Sharma, 2016), selection of software effort estimation (Bansal, Kumar, & Garg, 2017).(2)Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS), presented by Ghorabaee, Zavadskas, Turskis, and Antucheviciene (2016), measures the overall performance of an alternative by Euclidean and Hamming distances from the negative-ideal point. The CODAS utilizes the Euclidean distance as the primary measure of assessment. If the Euclidean distance of two alternatives is very close to each other, the Hamming distance is utilized to compare them. The degree of closeness of Euclidean distance is set by a threshold parameter. The Euclidean distance and Hamming distance are measured for l2-norm and l1-norm indifference spaces, respectively (Yoon, 1987). Therefore, in the CODAS method, we first assess the alternatives in an l2-norm indifference space. If the alternatives are not comparable in this space, we go to an l1-norm indifference space. To perform this process, we should compare each pair of alternatives. CODAS approach has already been applied in market segment evaluation (Ghorabaee, Amiri, Zavadskas, Hooshmand, & Antuchevic\u0306ien\u0117, 2017).(3)In order to compute the information measure (distance measure, similarity measure and entropy) of two interval-valued fuzzy soft sets, we propose a new method for constructing of distance measure and similarity measure. Meanwhile, some special properties are discussed in detail. Later, we apply the proposed similarity measure for decision making.\n",

This model is not the same from the existing interval-valued fuzzy soft weight determining methods, which can be divided into two aspects: one is the subjective weighting evaluation methods and the other is the objective weighting determine methods, which can be computed by the new proposed entropy determining method. The subjective weighting methods concentrate on the preference information of the experts (Feng et al., 2010), while they overlook the objective information. The objective weighting determine methods do not take the preference of the decision maker into consideration, in other words, these methods fail to take the risk attitude of the decision maker into account (Xiao et al., 2013). The feature of our weighting model can show both the subjective information and the objective information. Consequently, combining objective weights with subjective weights, a combined model to achieve parameters\u2019 weights is presented. Moreover, our weight determining method has keep in accordance with the references (Peng et al., 2017, Peng and Yang, 2017) when using the corresponding decision making method for achieving the final decision results.",

For simplicity, we call i=[I-(x),I+(x)] an interval-valued fuzzy number (IVFN) denoted by i=[i-,i+].\nDefinition 2.2Xu and Da, 2002Let x=[x-,x+] and y=[y-,y+] be two IVFNs, \u03bb\u2208[0,1], then their operational laws are defined as follows:(1)\nx+y=[x-,x+]+[y-,y+]=[x-+y-,x++y+];(2)\n\u03bbx=[\u03bbx-,\u03bbx+];(3)\nx\u03bb=[(x-)\u03bb,(x+)\u03bb];(4)\nx\u00b7y=[x-,x+]\u00b7[y-,y+]=[x-\u00b7y-,x+\u00b7y+];(5)\nx=y iff x-=y- and x+=y+;(6)\nxc=[1-x+,1-x-];(7)\n-x=[-x+,-x-].\n\nRemark 2.3From (1), Peng and Yang (2017) see that it may be not satisfied the definition of IVFN when x=[0.4,0.5],y=[0.6,0.7], but it has fundamentality of computation. Moreover, for (7), although it can be easily known that it will be out of positive number range, it also has fundamentality of computation. That is to say, it can see IVFN as a special interval number which can satisfy the above cases.\nDefinition 2.4Son, 2007Let U be an initial universe and A be a set of parameters, a pair (F,A) is called an interval-valued fuzzy soft set over P\u223c(U), where F is a mapping given by F:A\u2192P\u223c(U). P\u223c(U) denotes the set of all interval-valued fuzzy subsets of U.\n\u2200\u03b5\u2208A,F(\u03b5) is an interval-valued fuzzy subset of U, and it is called an interval-valued fuzzy value set of parameter \u03b5. Let F(\u03b5)(x) denote the membership value that object x holds parameter \u03b5, then F(\u03b5) can be written as an interval-valued fuzzy set that F(\u03b5)={x/F(\u03b5)(x)|x\u2208U}={x/[F-(\u03b5)(x),F+(\u03b5)(x)]|x\u2208U}.\nDefinition 2.5Son, 2007The complement of an interval-valued fuzzy soft set (F,A), is denoted by (F,A)c and is defined by (F,A)c=(Fc,A). \u2200\u03b5\u2208A,x\u2208U,Fc(\u03b5)(x)=[1-F+(\u03b5)(x),1-F-(\u03b5)(x)].In the following, Peng and Yang (2017) give a comparative law based on interval-valued fuzzy soft sets by score function and deviation function.\nDefinition 2.6Peng and Yang, 2017Let (F,A) be an interval-valued fuzzy soft set, then the score function of (F,A) is defined as follows:(2)sp((F,A))=\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nF-(\u03b5j)(xi)+F+(\u03b5j)(xi)-12mn.\n\nDefinition 2.7Peng and Yang, 2017Let (F,A) be an interval-valued fuzzy soft set, then the deviation function of (F,A) is defined as follows:(3)d((F,A))=1mn\u2211i=1m\u2211j=1nF-(\u03b5j)(xi)+F+(\u03b5j)(xi)-12-sp((F,A))2.\nBased on above score function and deviation function, Peng and Yang (2017) derive the following comparative law.\nDefinition 2.8Peng and Yang, 2017For two interval-value fuzzy soft sets (F,A) and (G,A), then(1)if sp((F,A))>sp((G,A)), then (F,A) is superior to (G,A), denoted by (F,A)\u227b(G,A);(2)if sp((F,A))<sp((G,A)), then (G,A) is superior to (F,A), denoted by (F,A)\u227a(G,A);(3)if sp((F,A))=sp((G,A)), then(a)if dp((F,A))>dp((G,A)), then (G,A) is superior to (F,A), denoted by (F,A)\u227a(G,A);(b)if dp((F,A))=dp((G,A)), then (G,A) is equivalent to (F,A), denoted by (F,A)\u223c(G,A);(c)if dp((F,A))<dp((G,A)), then (F,A) is superior to (G,A), denoted by (F,A)\u227b(G,A).\n\nFor simplicity, we only take m=n=1 into consideration for computing the score function of two IVFNs. The deviation function has no reference value due to dp(F(\u03b5)(x))=0. Hence, the above score function can be rewritten as follows:\nDefinition 2.9Peng and Yang, 2017Let F(\u03b5)(x) be an IVFN, then the score function of F(\u03b5)(x) is defined as follows:(4)sp(F(\u03b5)(x))=F-(\u03b5)(x)+F+(\u03b5)(x)-12.\n\nRemark 2.10Suppose that F(\u03b5)(x)=[0.5,0.6] and G(\u03b5)(x)=[0.45,0.65]. If we use the above score function to select the desirable alternative, we can get sp(F(\u03b5)(x))=sp(G(\u03b5)(x))=0.55. Hence, we can\u2019t make a distinction between F(\u03b5)(x) and G(\u03b5)(x), which means that this score function can\u2019t achieve the order in this case.Notice the deficiencies of the score function proposed by Peng and Yang (2017), in the following, we give a superior score function which can identify the difference of two IVFNs.\nDefinition 2.11For an IVFN F(\u03b5)(x)=[F-(\u03b5)(x),F+(\u03b5)(x)], its score function is defined as follows:(5)spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))=eF-(\u03b5)(x)+F+(\u03b5)(x)-11+F+(\u03b5)(x)-F-(\u03b5)(x).\n\nTheorem 2.12\nFor an IVFN\nF(\u03b5)(x)=[F-(\u03b5)(x),F+(\u03b5)(x)],spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))\nmonotonically increases with respect to\nF-(\u03b5)(x)\nand\nF+(\u03b5)(x)\n, respectively.\n\nProofAccording to Eq. (5), we get the first partial derivative of spxd(F(\u03b5)(x)) with F+(\u03b5)(x), \u2202spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))\u2202F+(\u03b5)(x)=eF+(\u03b5)(x)+F-(\u03b5)(x)-1(F+(\u03b5)(x)-F-(\u03b5)(x))(1+F+(\u03b5)(x)-F-(\u03b5)(x))2\u2a7e0\nSimilarly, we can obtain the first partial derivative of spxd(F(\u03b5)(x)) with F-(\u03b5)(x), \u2202spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))\u2202F-(\u03b5)(x)=eF+(\u03b5)(x)+F-(\u03b5)(x)-1(2+F+(\u03b5)(x)-F-(\u03b5)(x))(1+F+(\u03b5)(x)-F-(\u03b5)(x))2\u2a7e0.\nHence, we can have spxd(F(\u03b5)(x)) monotonically increases with respect to F-(\u03b5)(x) and F+(\u03b5)(x), respectively. \u25a1\nTheorem 2.13\nFor an IVFN\nF(\u03b5)(x)\n, a new score function\nspxd(F(\u03b5)(x))\nsatisfies:\n(1)\ne-1\u2a7dspxd(F(\u03b5)(x))\u2a7de;(2)\nspxd(F(\u03b5)(x))=e iff F(\u03b5)(x)=[1,1];(3)\nspxd(F(\u03b5)(x))=e-1 iff F(\u03b5)(x)=[0,0].\n\nProofAccording to Theorem 2.12, we can know that if we only take F-(\u03b5)(x) or F+(\u03b5)(x) into consideration, spxd(F(\u03b5)(x)) obtain the min-value or max-value when F(\u03b5)(x)=[0,0] or F(\u03b5)(x)=[1,1]. That is to say, spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))min=e-1 and spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))max=e. Therefore, e-1\u2a7dspxd(F(\u03b5)(x))\u2a7de. \u25a1\nTheorem 2.14\nLet\nF(\u03b5)(x)=[F-(\u03b5)(x),F+(\u03b5)(x)]\nand\nG(\u03b5)(x)=[G-(\u03b5)(x),G+(\u03b5)(x)]\nbe two IVFNs, if\nF-(\u03b5)(x)>G-(\u03b5)(x)\nand\nF+(\u03b5)(x)>G+(\u03b5)(x)\n, then\nspxd(F(\u03b5)(x))>spxd(G(\u03b5)(x))\n.\n\nProofAccording to Theorem 2.12, we can know that spxd(F(\u03b5)(x)) monotonically increases with respect to F-(\u03b5)(x) or F+(\u03b5)(x).Hence, if F-(\u03b5)(x)>G-(\u03b5)(x) and F+(\u03b5)(x)>G+(\u03b5)(x), then spxd(F(\u03b5)(x))>spxd(G(\u03b5)(x)). \u25a1\n",

The mine explosion is one the most hazardous dangers in mine accidents. The mine explosion enormously threatens the safety of work and life and imperils the safety production of mine. Since the explosion accidents often occur unexpectedly and suddenly, it is not easy to predict the accident to a crumb and have enough preparations and emergency actions ahead of time. Therefore, the emergency response plans and the simulations of the accidents are a requisite approach in disaster preparedness and appropriate responses. The high quality and feasibility of the emergency plans will directly influence the later emergency actions, and affect the evolution of disasters. Consequently, the evaluation and decision of the given emergency plans with simulations is considered essential for the disaster management of mine accidents (Hao, Xu, Zhao, & Fujita, 2017).Example 4.3Assume that there are five emergency plans U={x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} to be considered for an explosion accident in the coal mine. The expert chooses the decision parameters set E={e1,e2,e3,e4,e5} to be the noxious gas concentration e1 (denoted as gas), reducing casualty of current events e2 (denoted as casualty), the smoke and the dust level e3 (denoted as smoke), the feasibility of rescue operations e4 (denoted as feasibility) and repairing facility damages caused by the emergency e5 (denoted as facility). Based on the general evolving principle and the characteristics of the mine accidents, we can determine that all parameters are benefit parameters. Suppose that the expert has the following prior weight set given by his/her prior experience or preference: w=(w1,w2,w3,w4,w5)=(0.3,0.2,0.14,0.16,0.2). The assessments for emergency plans arising from questionnaire investigation to the expert and constructing an interval-valued fuzzy soft set (F,E) with its tabular form given by Table 3\n.In what follows, we utilize the algorithms proposed above to select emergency plans under interval-valued fuzzy soft information.According to Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3 shown in Table 4\n, we can conclude that the final decision results are the same, i.e., x3 is the most desirable emergency plan.

However, the limiting condition that the probability of equality of final decision results is great. That is to say, we can hardly make decision.\nExample 5.3Suppose that we invite another expert to evaluate the coal mine in Example 5.3. The weight information given by expert has the prior weight set given by his/her prior experience or preference: w=(w1,w2,w3,w4,w5)=(0.35,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.2). The assessments for emergency plans arising from questionnaire investigation to the expert are different, which is shown in Table 5\n.The final decision results and ranking are shown in Table 6\n. Based on the above discussion in Remarks 6.1 and 6.2, we know that the unreasonable results for MABAC method (Peng et al., 2017) owe to the \u201c0\u201d problem.From Fig. 4\n, we observe that the proposed algorithms (WDBA, CODAS and similarity measure) are moderately correlated with similarity measure (Peng et al., 2017) and MABAC (Peng et al., 2017) (90%). The reason for such variation is implicit from the nature of formulation used by each of these methods. To further demonstrate the strength of our algorithms, we compare them to existing methods (Peng et al., 2017). Fig. 5\nshows the comparison of these five methods which clarifies the power of proposed algorithms better in distinguishing the optimal alternative and obtain the optimal alternative without counterintuitive phenomena. In Fig. 6\n, we can find that the proposed weight determining model can effectively reflect the subjective information and objective information, but the combined weight proposed by Peng et al. (2017) can\u2019t reveal the difference compared with the given weight information. That is to say, our weight determining model can illustrate the data law given by expert, not limit to the known subjective weight.\n",

(2009) comes from the use of interval fuzzy choice values. As it was pointed out by Feng et al. (2010), the \u201cinterval fuzzy choice value\u201d presented by Yang et al. (2009) is just the sum of membership degrees and non-membership of an alternative with respect to all parameters, interval fuzzy choice value can\u2019t be interpreted as the number of the parameter satisfied by the alternative. It can be seen as a synthesized measure to size up each alternative by a fusion of all parameters. However, this direct addition of all the membership values and non-membership values with respect to diverse parameters is not always rational. In fact, it just like the addition of weight and height.The following example will illustrate that algorithm in Yang et al. (2009) may not be successfully applied to some soft decision making problems.\nExample 5.5Suppose that (F,E) is an interval-valued fuzzy soft set and Table 7\ngives its tabular representation with choice values and scores.From Table 7, we can find that the scores of all alternatives are identical, in other words, all of them could be selected as the best choice by algorithm in Yang et al. (2009). Hence, it is unreasonable in current case. But in fact, we can achieve an optimal alternative by our pioneered algorithms and the existing algorithms (Peng et al., 2017). Suppose that we use Eq. (13) to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by our algorithms and use Eq. (7) in Peng et al. (2017) to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by Peng and Dai\u2019s algorithms Peng et al. (2017). Meanwhile, assume that there is no discriminative power of cost parameters and benefit parameters, i.e., we think that the parameters are benefit parameters. Therefore, we can have the decision results by our algorithms and the existing algorithms (Peng et al., 2017), which is presented in Table 8\n.\n",

Algorithm 8comparison table (Yuan & Hu, 2012) \n\n\nRemark 5.12As stated in Yuan and Hu (2012), the given approach is in fact a comparable table method. Some of these problems are essentially humanistic and thus subjective in nature; there does not exist a uniform criterion for evaluating the alternatives. Apparently, the comparable table proposed by Yuan and Hu (2012) cannot be applied to IVFSS based decision making in some cases.\nExample 5.13Peng et al., 2017Assume that (F,E) is an interval-valued fuzzy soft set. Then Table 11\ngives its tabular representation and their decision results.From Table 11, we can find that the score values of all alternatives are identical, in other words, all of them could be selected as the best choice by algorithm in Yuan and Hu (2012). Hence, it is unreasonable in current case. But in fact, we can achieve an optimal alternative by our proposed algorithms and the existing algorithms (Peng et al., 2017). Suppose that we use Eq. (13) to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by our algorithms and use Eq. (7) in Peng et al. (2017) to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by Peng and Dai\u2019s algorithms Peng et al. (2017). Meanwhile, assume that there is no discriminative power of cost parameters and benefit parameters, i.e., we think that the parameters are benefit parameters. Therefore, we can have the decision results by our algorithms and the existing algorithms (Peng et al., 2017, Yuan and Hu, 2012), which is presented in Table 12\n.\n",

(2017) can\u2019t reveal the difference compared with the given weight information.(4)We propose three algorithms to solve interval-valued fuzzy soft decision making problem by Weighted Distance Based Approximation (WDBA), COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment (CODAS) and similarity measure. Compared to the existing interval-valued fuzzy soft decision making methods, are (i) it can obtain the optimal alternative without counterintuitive phenomena (Peng et al., 2017); (ii) it has a great power in distinguishing the optimal alternative (Feng et al., 2010, Peng et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2009, Yuan and Hu, 2012); (iii) it can avoid the parameter selection problems (Feng et al., 2010).\n",
