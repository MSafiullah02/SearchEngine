Though many factors may contribute, such as environmental changes and social behavior, it has been demonstrated, and rigorously proven for finite populations, that internal fluctuations in a system\u2019s dynamics can organize in such a way to induce a large fluctuation along a most probable, or optimal, path to extinction [3\u20135]. Such fluctuations to infection-free states have been studied extensively inwell-mixed systems, including the role of vaccination and treatment programs in reducing the average time to extinction [3,6]. Similarly, the most probable extinction paths have been found in networks with homogeneous degree, but the behavior appears to be independent of network topology, as in the well-mixed limit [7].",

In the latter, we demonstrate an interesting multistep structure in which low-degree node infections decrease first, followed by a quick, nearly complete extinction in high-degree nodes, and finishing with a low-degree extinction. The approach is then used to design a novel targeted optimal treatment strategy that can exponentially reduce extinction times, but does not trivially treat the most well connected nodes, minimize the epidemic size, or maximize the number of treatments. Instead, the optimal control minimizes the \u201caction\u201d associated with a transition to extinction with respect to the network topology. Such controls that manipulate finite-size fluctuations inherent in contact processes based on topology are also novel in the study of complex networks [6,15].",
