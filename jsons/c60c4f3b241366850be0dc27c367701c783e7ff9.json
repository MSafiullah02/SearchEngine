Limited testing capacity across the country has been widely identified as a key driver of suppressed coronavirus case-counts. The calls to increase testing capacity are well-justified as they become a more frequent point of discussion in the public sphere. While expanded testing is a laudable goal, selection bias will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction number until the entire population is sampled. Moreover, tests are imperfect as false positive/negative rates interact in complex ways with selection bias. In this paper, we attempt to clarify this interaction. Through simple calculations, we demonstrate pitfalls and paradoxes that can arise when considering case-count data in the presence of selection bias and measurement error. The discussion guides several suggestions on how to improve current case-count reporting.",

The reason is straightforward: current models do not account simultaneously for selection bias and measurement error. Selection bias enters due to differences in testing strategies across countries and states. In the US, for example, limited testing capacity has caused local and state health departments to focus on testing only high-risk populations. Moreover, testing requires the individual to self-select into asking for a test and then receiving approval by their doctor. Demands for increased testing capacity, while laudable, ignore the issues of self-selection and measurement error. While increasing testing capacity increases data quantity, there is no guarantee for increased data quality. We will show that aggressive pushes for ramped up testing capacity that are tied to decreases in data quality may have a mitigated impact in our ability to estimate quantities of interest such as prevalence and effective reproduction number.",

Without a complete understanding of these interactions, we are destined to misinterpret case-counts and come to erroneous conclusions. We will demonstrate why there is a strong need for more precision and care in presenting COVID-19 analyses to the broader research and non-academic communities.",

            "text": "1.1. Outline. This article discusses the relationship between three statistical concepts: selection bias, measurement error, and the too often forgotten population size. We clarify mathematically why the situation is much more complex than it first appears. Through simple mathematical arguments, we clarify five important issues related to COVID-19 case-count analysis. First, we show that unadjusted prevalence rates are (unsurprisingly) biased when tests are imperfect. What is surprising is that the direction and magnitude of the bias can vary substantially and interacts with the sampling fraction. Next we show that data quality for adjusted prevalence rates includes an additional term in the error decomposition that captures the interplay among measurement error, selection bias, and prevalence. Third, we show that daily trends in rate of positive tests is equally problematic even if testing rates and selection protocols are held constant. We show that the rate of change in COVID-19 observed case-counts overestimates the true rate of change prior to the peak time and underestimates it immediately after. This implies a data scientist analyzing observed rates will be (on average) overly pessimistic in the early stages of the pandemic, and overly optimistic subsequent to the peak times. We show that estimates of the effective reproduction number may be similarly impacted. Fourth, we show that cross-country comparisons are difficult at best with population size, sampling fraction, and data quality all interacting to impact null hypothesis testing. Fifth, we discuss a sensitivity analysis method for estimating data quality and its use in understanding the potential biases in COVID-19 case-count analyses. We then end the paper with a discussion of the benefits of randomized testing and use of auxiliary information to improve over simple random sampling.",

For simplicity, we start by ignoring the dynamic nature of the viral outbreak as well as the fact that individuals can recover from the disease and assume either individual j is COVID-19 positive and Y j = 1 or is COVID-19 negative and Y j = 0.

            "text": "This points to a troubling and paradoxical situation: the error relative to SRS increases as a function of population size. Meng [2018] termed this the \"Law of Large Populations\" (LLP). This points to a critical issue in the current media practices in communication of case-count data: two countries with the same testing strategy (i.e., E I [\u03c1 I,Y ] equal) can yield wildly different estimates due to population size. Large countries like the US may have similar true prevalence rates as smaller countries like the UK. Even under similar testing strategies, the mean-squared error in the prevalence rate for the US will have substantially more variation in comparison to SRS. Comparing the US to the UK, for example, the MSE will increase by a factor of almost five. Thus conclusions drawn from observed case-count records may be not just wrong, but very wrong. Second, there have been calls for increased testing. While important, many conflate increased testing capacity with increased quality of testing. We will discuss this point further in Section 5. As of May 8th, the US has performed 8, 412, 095 tests in total. Figure 1 shows the trajectory of testing per day and positive cases per day in the US. The US population is roughly 328 million, meaning the fraction sampled is f = 0.026. After smoothing, the empirical prevalence is 9.1% on May 8th. Supposing COVID-19 positive individuals are 2 times more likely to get tested than those individuals who are COVID-19 negative, the question is \"What is the sample size from a SRS that would yield equivalent MSE in the estimated prevalence?\" Using the above MSE result, Meng showed the effective sample size is equal to n ef f \u2264",

The above statistical decomposition clarifies the importance of this quantity f . In particular, note that the statistical error also includes a bias term due to measurement error and this term increases as the sampled fraction f increases. Therefore, how the first two terms interact with the final term depends on the fraction of the population sampled.

Here, we discuss the impact of the interaction on the effective sample size when testing capacity is tied to measurement error. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been well-justified calls for increases in testing capacity. These increases, however, may come at the cost of increases in false-positive and false-negative rates. In terms of effective sample size, if the data quality term remains constant, then testing increases may not significantly improve the effective sample size. Consider the simplest case where f increases from 0.05 to 0.1; suppose this increase was associated with false positive rate increasing from 0.5% to 5% and the false negative rate rising from 5% to 20%. Then the standard analysis would suggest a reduction in the MSE by 47% but the actual decrease is by 26%. This implies that doubling the sampling rate will only increase the effective sample size by a factor 2.9 rather than the expected 4 fold increase that is expected.

All I want to know is when we hit the point at which the curve flattens and number of deaths decrease. That can't be too hard, surely! Unfortunately, ratio estimators do not cancel errors as now both the numerator and the denominator are uncertain. This means selection bias and measurement error can have paradoxical effects. Here we consider the ratio estimators for the relative change in the prevalence rate. We let\u0232 t\u22121 and\u0232 t denotes the prevalence (across the entire population) at time step t \u2212 1 and t respectively (i.e., prevalence on two consecutive days).

Testing appears relatively stable over a week which suggests assuming \u2206 t (i.e., differential in the selection rate) varies slowly over time may be a plausible assumption. Note, however, that constant \u2206 t does not imply constant data quality (see Appendix B for details). Figure 5a shows the number of tests has remained relatively constant in the last few weeks, specifically relative to the total NY population, assuming f t also varies slowly in time is reasonable. Finally, the measurement error adjustment is likely to be constant as no new testing procedures have been reported. This would not be true in states like Michigan, where testing criteria have been expanding every few weeks. The final component is an adjustment to this differential error based on the statistical error at the first time point.

In each case, the rate of change in prevalence is likely to be overestimated prior to the peak and then underestimated afterwards. From a decision making perspective, such biases have potential impact. First, the overestimation may give lawmakers and governors more leverage in proposing aggressive actions that reduce prevalence. Of course, the analysis supports the argument that the estimates based on available data are overly pessimistic. What both sides miss is that the direction of bias is non-constant over time. After we hit the peak, estimates will likely under-estimate prevalence. Such bias puts pressure on lawmakers and governors to prematurely relax social distancing measures. Moreover, the question is \"Can we trust the observed data to let us know if we have reached the peak?\" It appears that the peak time is the easiest to estimate in terms of having minimal error using availability data. Note, however, that the standard errors on such estimates will be incredibly wide due to the low effective sample size as discussed in Section 2.",

As of May 5th, Canada has performed a total of 24.92 tests per 1,000 people while the US has performed a total of 22.01 tests per 1,000 people 2 so the data quantities are approximately equal to f = 23/1000 = 0.023.

We can write the difference in the rates as R t1 \u2212 R t2 = 1 \u03b3 log 1 + e 1t 1 + e 2t where e jt is the error associated given in Section 2.3. Recall that the error allowed for over-estimation prior to the peak and then under-estimation post-peak. Here, these errors can mingle in interesting ways. Consider two countries (A and B) in which the peak occurs 2 weeks prior for country A then country B but other. Figure 4 presents such a comparison where each country's disease trajectory follows an SIR model as described in Section 2.2 with different parameters. Figure 4b shows how the errors interact in complex ways. First, the gap is correctly estimated; then the gap is over-estimated as country A sees a rapid rise in cases; then the gap is even more over-estimated as country A improves and the rate is under-estimated while country B sees a rapid increase in their case-count and their rate is over-estimated; then country A's rate is correctly estimated while country B's rate is under-estimated as it sees improvement in infection rates; finally, the gap disappears. We are not claiming this will always be the case, and indeed for small enough selection bias and/or large gaps in case-counts such complex behaviour will not occur; however, this is simply to point out how observed information can tell a more complex story than the truth (i.e., country A recovers 1 month prior to country B).",

Here, we try and address the empirical question of how to estimate the data quality E I [\u03c1 I,Y ] in the current context. In Meng [2018] , estimation of the data quality relied on observing the true outcome. In election data, for example, we observe the vote totals after the fact and can use this as ground truth. We are not so lucky in the current crisis. Here, we propose a simple procedure that uses survey samples as noisy but unbiased estimates of the true prevalence. Our goal is less inferential and more to provide a sensitivity analysis that can aid in understanding the amount of information in observational COVID case-count data. On April 23rd, Andrew Cuomo announced results from a study in New York state. It found 13.9% of 3,000 people tested across the state had signs of the virus. The study did not report sensitivity and specificity; therefore, we take reported measures from the Santa Clara study [Bendavid et al., 2020] 3 . The reported specificity is 82.8% (95% CI: 76.0-88.4%) and sensitivity is 99.5% (95% CI: 99.2-99.7%). This corresponds to a false negative rate of 17.2% (11.6-24.0%) and false positive rate of 0.5% (0.3 -0.8%). Correcting for these rates we have an estimated prevalence of 15.9% with a range of 14.8% to 17.0% using the ranges of the false positive and negative rates. Figure 5a plots the number of new total and positive tests per day. Figure 5 plots the fraction of tests that were positiver per day. In both cases, we applied an exponential smoothing to the reported values because the spiky pattern is likely due to testing backlogs. Given the report was on the 23rd, we suppose for simplicity that the study was run several days prior on the 20th of April. On the 20th, there were 19, 654 tests performed and 617, 555 tests had been performed up to to and including the 19th. The population of New York state is 19, 378, 102. Subtracting off the number of individuals who had already been tested yields a sampling fraction Here, we assume the New York survey is a simple random sample from the state's population. We recognize that the survey is not such a sample, but techniques like poststratification and raking can be applied to calibrate estimates. Then the error is 16.6%. Using (1), we can use the error to construct an estimate of the relative sampling rate:",

While nothing above is definitive, it points to the interplay of selection bias and measurement error. This calculation gives us simple tools to understand how sensitivity and specificity impact our estimators and therefore how much we should trust conclusions based on these assumptions.

Being skeptical of observed data does not imply governments and communities should wait for high quality data to act; this is especially true in the current high risk scenario.

Indeed, epidemiologists and public health officials have a strong understanding of the basic facts of pandemics and disease spread. Social distancing, contact tracing and mass testing are all important. Individuals and communities with low quality data and only basic information will hopefully make decisions that respect inherent risks to their well being as well as the high degree of uncertainty in the observed data.
