Emergency is a state which derivates from some kind of imbalance in complex system. The essential reason is that energy accumulates to a certain extent which throws the system in a critical state, an incentive to break the balance. Such critical state always occurs spontaneously in imbalanced system, called as the selforganized critical state. The critical state bridges the gap between the rules and disorder in concept, as a medium state. This state is not static, not lapsable casually but approximate to an extremely unstable balance, just like sand is always on the edge of the upheaval [6] .",
