We analyze here the occurrences of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, which are putative pathogen-associated molecular patterns, along the viral sequence. Carrying out a comparative analysis with other ssRNA viruses and within the Coronaviridae family, we find the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2, while low compared to other betacoronaviruses, widely fluctuates along its primary sequence. While the CpG relative abundance and its associated CpG force parameter [1] are low for the spike protein (S) and comparable to circulating seasonal coronaviruses such as HKU1, they are much greater and comparable to SARS and MERS for the 3'-end of the viral genome. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein (N), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3'UTRs of all subgenomic RNA, has high CpG content. We speculate this dual nature of CpG content can confer to SARS-CoV-2 high ability to both enter the host and trigger pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in different contexts. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a new application of selective forces on dinucleotides to estimate context driven mutational processes, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG force in the N protein, leading to a loss in CpG content. Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein (ZAP) protein.",

            "text": "The innate immune system and RNA processing machinery recognizes \"non-self\" patterns and motifs in viruses that are rarely seen in the hosts they infect. These patterns can differ between species [2] . When a virus enters a new host, it can present pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in its new host that are rarely seen in circulating strains that have adapted to that host's immune environment over evolutionary timescales. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, therefore, provides a rare window into innate immune signaling that may be relevant for understanding immune-mediated pathologies of SARS-CoV-2, anti-viral treatment strategies, and the evolutionary dynamics of the virus, where evidence for selective pressures on viral features can reflect what defines \"self\" in its new host. As a case in point, the 1918 influenza pandemic was likely caused by a strain that originated in water fowl and entered the human population after possible evolving in an intermediate host. That viral genome presented CpG dinucleotides within a context and level of density rarely found in the human genome where they are severely underespressed, particularly in a set of genes coding for the proteins associated with antiviral innate immunity [3, 2, 4, 1] . Over the past century the 1918 H1N1 lineage evolved in a directed manner to lower these motifs and gain UpA motifs, in a way that could not be explained by its amino acid usage of codon bias [5, 1] . It has since been found that these motifs can engage the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system [6, 7] , and directly bind the Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein (ZAP), both in a CpG dependent manner [8, 9, 10] . Hence, the interrogation of emergent viruses from this perspective can predict novel host virus interactions.",

It has been characterized by a large heterogeneity in the immune response to the virus [11, 12, 13] and likely dysregulated type I interferon signaling [14, 15] . Various treatments to attenuate inflammatory responses have been proposed and are currently under analysis or being clinically tested [16] . It is therefore essential to quantify pathogen-associated patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 genome for multiple reasons. The first is to better understand the pathways engaged by innate immune agonism and the specific agonists to help build better antiviral therapies. Another is to better predict the evolution of motif content in synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2, as it will help understand the process and timescales of attenuation in humans. Third is to offer a principled approach for optimizing vaccine strategy for designed strains [17, 18] to better reflect human-genome features.",

            "text": "In this work we will use the framework developed in [1] to carry out a study of non-self associated dinucleotide usage in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The statistical physics framework is based on the idea of identifying the abundance or scarcity of dinucleotides given their expected usage based on host features. In [1] some of us introduced a parameter, which we call the selective force, that characterizes the deviation with respect to a null model in which the number of dinculeotides is the one statistically expected under a set of constraints. For instance, the selective force on CpG dinucledoties is zero if the number of CpG is exactly the one expected, is positive when it is larger than what is expected and negative otherwise. Such a force generalizes the dinucleotide relative abundance introduced in [2] , not only when choosing the nucleotide bias as the null model, but also to a null model built on other features such as a fixed amino acid sequence and reference codon bias. CpG forces could be related to the evolutionary constraint to lower or increase CpG number under the pressure of host PRRs that recognize a pathogen. Such formalism has further been applied to identify non-coding RNA from repetitive elements in the human genome expressed in cancer that can also engage PRRs [19] , to characterize the CpG evolution through synonymous mutations in H1N1 [1] , and to characterize local and non-local forces on dinucleotides across RNA viruses [7] .",

To calculate such forces we need a reference nucleotide bias, to give a null model for nucleotide usage (See Methods Sec. 6.1, 6.2). We will in the following use as nucleotide bias, the one calculated from the human genome [25] . This is the natural choice since we ultimately want to predict regions sensed by PRRs as non-self, which may engage the human innate immune response. We have verified that the specific choice of such bias does not change qualitatively the results in the comparative analysis, as long as the same set of reference frequencies is used to compute the forces across viral genomes.

It is worth noticing that SARS-CoV-2 is among the viruses with smallest global CpG force and some hCoV that circulate in humans with less pathogenicity have a global CpG force comparable or higher than that of SARS-CoV-2, so there is not a straightforward correlation between global CpG force and the pathology of a coronavirus in humans. For the force on UpA dinucleotides, it is clear already from this comparison that it is anti-correlated with the CpG force, as we expect for the complementarity between such motifs 1 . Due to the fact that the genes and the global length of viruses in the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera are quite similar, the comparison of CpG forces gives the same outcome than the direct comparison of the number of CpG along the sequence, see Supp. To go beyond the global analysis we have performed a local analysis on CpG motif usage, by looking to the local forces in fixed-length windows along the genome (similar results are also obtained by looking directly at the Forces computed on the whole genome. Species are well clustered, due to the large conservation of the sampled sequences, except for the strains originating in bats which is a grouping of several diverse strains. The anticorrelation of the CpG and the UpA force is due to their complementarity. (b, c, d): Local analysis in sliding windows of 3 kb along the genome. Local forces along the genome (b, c): while the average CpG force of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low, the variance along the genome is high with greater CpG forces in certain regions (such as the coding region for protein N) and lower CpG forces in other (e. g. coding region for protein S). (b)-lower panel: maximum value of the local CpG force showing that values for SARS-CoV-2 moves closer to the most dangerous viruses.

The high CpG content at the extremities can have an important effect on the activation of the immune response via sensing, as the life cycle of the virus is such that the initial and final part of the genome are those involved in the subgenomic transcription needed for viral replication [26, 27] . During the infection many more RNA fragments with these regions are present in the cytoplasm, than the other regions of the viral genome. In this sense, despite the relatively low CpG content of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other coronaviruses, there is can be a high concentrations of CpG rich RNA due to the higher transcription of these regions.",

This suggests a comparison among the coronaviruses based on the part of the sequence with the highest CpG and UpA force, which is presented in Fig. 2b (lower bar plot) . In this case, the results are much closer to what may be expected: MERS and SARS, viruses that are likely less well adapted to a human host, have the highest local peaks in CpG content, followed by SARS-CoV-2 and then by seasonal strains that circulate in humans. These results are corroborated by the same qualitative picture which comes from the analysis of CpG motif density, as shown in Suppl. Fig. SI .2c. It is interesting to notice that high and very high levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) have been observed in, respectively, SARS and MERS and, at times, SARS-CoV-2 infection [28, 11] .",

However, most of the viral genome codes for proteins, so the analysis should take this feature into account. The advantage of the method of dinucleotide forces is that its statistical physics framework allows such constraints to be introduced in a straightforward manner (Methods Sec. 6.2). In Fig. 3a we perform the local analysis of forces on dinucleotides with the coding constraints, by using as reference codon usage bias the human one, along all the coding regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and in Figs. 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e, we focus on the genome regions coding for the nucleocapside (N) and spike (S) proteins [29, 30, 17] . A first, relevant observation is that the high variability which we discussed in Fig. 2c is confirmed by this analysis, and in particular the 3' peak of high CpG density and force is still present. Moreover, in Fig 3a some of the small non-coding regions which are excluded from the figure (as they are not used for the computation of the local force) are pointed out with black solid lines. It seems that large changes in local force happen in the vicinity of these lines, thus hinting at a possible role of recombination in the generation of this complex and heterogeneous local CpG-force landscape, though such a hypothesis would have to be confirmed by phylogenetic analysis.",

The first protein (in the standard 5'-to-3' order) is the S protein, and it corresponds to the low-peak in CpG force and density for SARS-CoV-2 in Fig. 2c . The S protein has to bind with ACE2 human receptor and TMPRSS2 [30] . It is also the longest structural protein. In Fig. 3e the CpG force along the region coding for S (S ORF) computed. SARS-CoV-2 shows the lowest average of CpG force among the human-infecting betacoronaviruses, see Fig. 3b , and also locally it has a force lower than most of the other beta-CoVs. A fascinating (as well as speculative) reason that could explain the low CpG force on the S protein, is again recombination: the S protein coding region may come (at least in part) from other coronaviruses that better bound human entry receptors [31] .",

Moreover, according to our model, mutations are not only driven by the local CpG force, but also by viral codon bias computed on the reference sequence 2 . It is therefore theoretically possible (and in full accord with our model) that, even in low CpG force regions, a mutation decreasing the CpG number is favorable due to the biases introduced by the distribution of synonymous codons. We developed a computational framework to estimate the odds of transition to a mutated sequence from SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan, 26-12-2019) based on the CpG-force model (Methods Sec. 6.3). For a synonymous mutation that does not change CpG, our synonymous mutation score (SMS), defined in Methods Sec. 6.3, will only depend on the change in codon biases due to the mutation. Additionally, mutations affecting CpG content bring contributions to the transition probabilities that depend on the local CpG force. In Fig. 4 we show our predictions for synonymous mutations in the N (4b, 4c) and the S (4d, 4e) proteins. Figs. 4b and 4d show SMS along, respectively, the N and S sequences and the mutations, respectively, lowering (blue), increasing (red), or leaving unchanged (black) the CpG content. We observe that the majority of mutations (taking into account multiplicity, labeled by stars in the figure) in SARS-CoV-2 correspond to high SMS, in agreement with our model. To make our arguments more quantitative, we tested the ability of our model to discriminate between observed and non-observed mutations. In Figs. 4c and 4e we show the histograms of the SMS corresponding to observed synonymous mutations (in green) and to putative mutations that would leave amino-acid content unchanged but have not been observed so far (in yellow). The distribution of SMS for observed mutations is shifted to higher values compared to their counterparts for non-observed mutations, both for the proteins N and S. Hence, our model is able to statistically discriminate between non-observed and observed synonymous mutations (ANOVA F-test: 94 for N and 247 for S). Note that for the null mutational models in which synonymous mutational rate are uniform, the score distribution for observed and unobserved mutations is equally peaked at zero (ANOVA F-test=1). A simpler model for the SMS using codon bias only, without force (Suppl. Fig. SI.5) is also able to discriminate between observed and non-observed mutations, albeit with a smaller score for protein N (ANOVA F-test=35) and a comparable result for S (ANOVA F-test=239), further demonstrating that S ORF synonymous mutations are likely due to a neutral reversion to the mean, while N ORF mutations may contain an additional pressure.",

The results of these additional tests are shown in Suppl. Fig. SI.6 . The ANOVA F-test and p-values are shown in Table 2 and confirm that while the uniform rate and the transition versus transversion bias are not enough to separate the score distributions between observed and unobserved mutations, for the N ORF adding a CpG force gives a very clear separation, in the two cases, while for the S ORF we observe a still present but less marked separation. Consequently, mutation data seem to confirm the hypothesis that the CpG force drives the evolution of synonymous mutations to lower number of CpG motifs in the N ORF. For the S ORF, which already has quite low CpG number, the situation is less clear: the observed tendency to CpG increase through synonymous mutations is compatible with the presence of a force pushing up this number, but is equally well explained by the viral codon bias model. This uncertainty is expected from the relatively small number of mutations with a CpG change in S protein region in the sequences collected so far.",

Notably the segment coding for the S protein has a much lower CpG content and force. Other regions, in particular the region after the slippage site in ORF1ab and the initial and final part of the genome including the N ORF, are characterized by a larger density of CpG motifs (and corresponding CpG force), which are comparable to the SARS and MERS viruses in the Betacoronavirus genus.",

            "text": "Interestingly the initial and final part of the genome are implied in the full-genome and subgenomic viral replication. In particular, the coding region of the N protein and its RNA sequence, present in the 3' untranslated region (UTRs) of all SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs, has been shown in [27] to be the most abundant transcript in the cytoplasm. The high concentration of this feature could contribute to a dysregulated innate immune response. SARS-CoV-2, due to its complex replication machinery, does not express its RNA at uniform concentration. A mechanism generating different densities of PAMPs being presented to the immune system at different points in the viral life cycle can affect immune recognition and regulation. The precise way this can contribute to immuno-pathologies associated with COVID-19 and how this is related to the cytokine signaling dysfunction associated with severe cases, need further experimental investigation. The sharp heterogeneity of the CpG abundance along the SARS-CoV-2 genome is also compatible with viral recombination, in agreement with the hypothesis stated in [31] . The degree to which this heterogeneity in any way reflects zoonotic origins should be further carried out using phylogeny. A first analysis of the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of COVID-19 shows that mutations increasing CpG content have occurred in the middle and low CpG content regions, in particular the S protein region. Conversely, mutations lowering the number of CpG have taken place in regions with higher CpG content, in particular, the N protein region. The sequence motifs preceding the loci of the CpG removed by mutations match some of the strongly binding patterns of the ZAP protein [9] .",

More data, collected at an unprecedented pace [34, 23, 22] , and on a longer evolutionary time are needed to confirm these hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate for an RNA virus due to the presence of a proofreading mechanism in its replication [35] .

Before any of our analyses, we discarded all the sequences where one or more nucleotides were wrongly read. This left us with 3329 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. To obtain Fig. 2 we considered, in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are taken from GISAID, other Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus sequences (whole genomes and genes) which have been obtained from VIPR [22] . The pre-processing consisted again of discarding all the sequences with one error or more. After this process we collected 341 SARS, 48 MERS, 20 hCoV-229E, 48 hCoV-NL63, 14 hCoV-HKU1, 124 hCoV-NL63, 166 bat-CoVs and 5 pangolin-CoVs whole genomes. For Fig. 2a and for Fig. 2b (lower panel) we used the largest number possible of sequences, up to a maximum of 100. For Fig. 2b (upper  panel) and Fig. 2c we chose a single sequence for each species. However, we checked that the result is qualitatively the same if we use other sequences from the same species for human coronaviruses. To obtain the plots in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 , we considered as reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence the one which has been collected on 26-12-2019 (ID: EPI ISL 406798). Sequences has been processed to ensure the correct reading frame. This means, for instance, that the ORF1ab gene is read in the standard frame up to the ribosomal shifting site, and it is read in the shifted frame from that site up to the end of the polyprotein. To produce the bar plots in Figs. 3b and 3d we collected genes data on VIPR. Then we discarded as usual all the sequences with one or more errors, and we computed for each gene an average of up to 20 different sequences (coming from the same species). For some structural proteins we did not find 20 different genes but in any case the standard deviation of the averages presented in Figs. 3b and 3d is smaller than 0.025 (and, for most of the viruses, much smaller).

Therefore, we have To proceed further, we can consider the case where g 1. This is a good approximation when x 0, and it is also fairly good as long as x is lower than 0, as in all the cases studied here. Under this hypothesis, we have where in the last step we used also that N 1. From this, by using that n = \u2202x log Z and requesting n = n0 = N f ab , we obtain Eq. (4). Fig. SI.1 shows the correlation between the CpG force with the nucleotide bias and the CpG relative abundance . Figure SI.1: Comparison between the CpG force and the CpG relative abundance index. As discussed in Sec. SI.2, these two quantities are almost identical when the genome is long. To show that, here 10 different genomes for several coronavirus species are used to compute these two quantities, and the dashed blue line is a linear fit of the resulting points. ",

(a): Local Forces, on sliding windows over 900 nucleotides, on all the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 (pre-processed to ensure the correct reading frame, see Methods Sec. 6.5). The horizontal line denotes the average force. Many large fluctuations coincide with boundaries of protein domains, suggesting that recombination could have had a role in creating theses CpG force fluctuations. In panels (b) and (d): bar plots for average local forces for structural proteins in the Coronaviridae family. The two largest structural proteins, N and S, have very different forces in SARS-CoV-2. Each bar is obtained by averaging the CpG force over several sequences (from VIPR[22] and GISAID[23], see SI.1), and the standard deviation of the average (not shown) is lower than 0.025. (c) and (e): local forces for N and S compared with the same proteins of other beta-coronaviruses. Horizontal lines denote the average forces.",
