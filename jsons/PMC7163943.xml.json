We initially chose cell lines with different characteristics such as a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (A\u2010431) and a human mammary tumour cell line (MCF\u20107). In order to allow us to delineate any potential uptake mechanism we also selected two mammary cancer cell lines (MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 and MDA\u2010MB\u2010468) which, according to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), express different cell surface receptors. Finally, we added another type of cell from a human pancreas adenocarcinoma (Capan\u20101).",

In this study 1 \u03bcm cystatin C was used, as this is within the physiological concentration range in different human body fluids (0.1\u20134 \u03bcm) [20]. Following incubation with cystatin C, cells were detached from the bottom of the wells by trypsin, which also meant that labelled protein attached to the cell surface was cleaved and could be washed away. Flow cytometry using the fluorophore Alexa\u2010488 as the protein label was used in these experiments. The resulting scattergram showed a dominating, easily defined group of cells that could be gated (Fig. 1A). Typically < 15% of the events were excluded. The reproducibility of the experiments was high and internalization of the labelled protein could be demonstrated easily (Fig. 1B). All five human cancer cell lines internalized Alexa\u2010488\u2010labelled cystatin C (Fig. 2A\u2013C). Incubation for 10 s was used to ensure that the washing conditions were sufficient, and demonstrated that cystatin bound at the cell surface was cleaved by trypsin and washed away. After 5 min an increase in some of the cell lines could be detected and after 30 min the cell fluorescence had increased in all five strains. The pattern of internalization was more or less equal in the five strains. Two unrelated proteins acting as protein inhibitors, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI; 4.3 kDa) and equistatin (22.3 kDa), were studied for comparison. Compared with cystatin C, a very low level of uptake of these molecules was detected in the different cell lines. To investigate whether the internalization of cystatin C was an active process, a similar experiment was carried out at 4 \u00b0C. None of the three cell lines tested showed any uptake of labelled cystatin C under these conditions (Fig. 2C\u2013E).",

A\u2010431 cells were selected initially because they showed negligible auto\u2010fluorescence when incubated for 6 h with 5 \u03bcm Alexa\u2010488\u2010labelled cystatin C. In principle, all cells possessed detectable cystatin C labelling. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses further demonstrated that cystatin C was present within the cells, in both cell bodies and processes, but was not detected in the plasma membrane. A large number of A\u2010431 and MCF\u20107 cells (Figs 3A and S1) showed widespread low\u2010signal cystatin C fluorescence in the cytoplasm, although fewer also contained larger fluorescence accumulations (in \u223c 10% of the cells). Similar intracellular localization of cystatin C was detected when cells were exposed to unlabelled cystatin C followed by immunolabelling of the cystatin C (endogenous and internalized), using a primary antibody against cystatin C and a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa\u2010568 fluorophore (Fig. S2). There was no fluorescence labelling in control cells or in cells used in antibody specificity tests (see Experimental procedures for a description of the control experiments). Live imaging experiments clearly showed uptake within 5 min and the Alexa\u2010488\u2010labelled cystatin C co\u2010localized with lysosome\u2010like structures stained by LysoTracker (Fig. 3B\u2013D).",

The concentration chosen is within the physiological range, between that in cerebrospinal fluid (0.5 \u03bcm) and seminal plasma (3.7 \u03bcm) [20]. These experiments clearly showed that the cystatin C content of the cells increased rapidly during the first 5 min and then continued to accumulate for at least 6 h, which was the final time\u2010point of these experiments (Fig. 5A). Repeated experiments showed that after 6 h the cystatin C level had increased to four to six times baseline steady\u2010state levels, as shown by ELISA. A plateau noted for the increase in cystatin C at longer incubation times is likely due to increased competition with cystatin C\u2010binding proteins (i.e. target cysteine proteases) when the extract concentrations of cystatin C approach the equilibrium constants for enzyme binding [4], affecting cystatin C\u2010directed antibodies used in the assay and leading to an underestimation of the real intracellular cystatin C concentration.",

In order to determine the concentration of active papain used in the assay, a fixed amount of enzyme was incubated with various concentrations of E\u201064. A titration curve was drawn and the amount of active papain calculated. The baseline cysteine protease inhibitory capacity of the Capan\u20101 cell lysate was then approximated by analysing various volumes of an extract from cells incubated for 24 h with NaCl/Pi, i.e. cells that had not been exposed to cystatin C. Before the experiment, the extract was boiled to denature all proteases and abolish their activity, a procedure that does not affect cystatins, which can withstand high temperatures without losing their inhibitory activity. It showed a concentration of \u223c 200 pmol cysteine protease inhibitor\u00b7mg protein\u22121. To elucidate whether the total cysteine protease inhibitory capacity changed after exposing cells to cystatin C, cells were incubated for 24 h with 1 \u03bcm cystatin C. The cysteine protease inhibitor concentration in these cell extracts was estimated to be 250 pmol\u00b7mg protein\u22121 by papain titration, indicating a substantial increase caused by the uptake of cystatin C, affecting the total cysteine protease inhibitory capacity (which should be mainly due to cytoplasmic cystatin B) within the cells [4].",

The other, N39K\u2013cystatin C, lacks inhibitory activity against the C13 family cysteine protease, legumain, because of removal of the key amino acid in the legumain\u2010binding site of cystatin C [22]. The amino acid substitutions reside in opposing parts of the cystatin C molecule, which makes these protein variants interesting. Experiments were carried out in cells from a human pancreas adenocarcinoma (Capan\u20101) using Alexa\u2010488 labelling of the cystatin C variants. Both variants of the inhibitor were internalized (Fig. 7B).

It is not clear, however, to what extent the implicated proteases function intra\u2010 or extracellularly. Recently, it has also been proposed that cystatin C has the capacity to promote astrogenesis and suppress oligodendrogenesis and these functions seemed to be independent of its cysteine protease inhibitor activity [23]. Thus, it is clear that cystatin C has various effects on the cell. Some of these seem to be independent of its cysteine protease inhibitory activity and some might be associated with its intracellular activity.

All five cell lines exhibited cystatin C internalization when exposed to extracellular cystatin C. In most experiments uptake could be detected after 30 min, but in some cases it could be seen after 5 min. The uptake curves were very similar in the cell strains studied and showed that all cells exhibited fluorescence after 6 h exposure to 1 \u03bcm fluorescence\u2010conjugated cystatin C. In addition, flow cytometry recorded that the uptake of a specific labelled protein in one specific cell strain was highly reproducible within, as well as between, runs. However, the fluorometric method used to measure the degree of protein labelling is not precise, although it provides a good estimate, and detailed comparisons of the quantity of uptake can therefore not be concluded. The lack of uptake in experiments carried out at 4 \u00b0C, as well as the competition experiments supported the idea that internalization is an active process and not a passive flow of molecules into the cells [24], thus suggesting receptor\u2010mediated uptake.",

These results agreed well with the flow cytometry data and suggest a linear uptake rate over a relatively long period (Fig. 5C).",

In the MCF\u20107 and A\u2010431 cell lines, CLSM demonstrated that internalized cystatin C was distributed through all parts of the cytoplasm, visualized as both smaller and larger accumulations. In addition, CLSM analyses indicated that \u223c 10% of the cells contained relatively high levels of cystatin C, which appeared to be localized in discrete cellular compartments, co\u2010localized with LysoTracker, thus indicating localization in acidic compartments such as lysosomes. Differences between cell types were also observed in the amount of cystatin C uptake and/or its intracellular localization. The heterogeneous cell morphology shown by microscopy further supports that subpopulations of cells possess different abilities in cystatin C uptake.",

This suggests that cystatin C constitutes \u223c 1% of the total cysteine protease inhibitor capacity in cells grown in medium, which is reasonable because cystatin A and B are the dominating intracellular, cytoplasmatic, cysteine protease inhibitors [4]. After 24 h exposure to 1 \u03bcm cystatin C the total cysteine protease inhibitor capacity as well as the cystatin C concentration of the cells increased. As indicated by the experiment in which the uptake was measured by ELISA, the cystatin C level increased at least fivefold (Fig. 5). Thus, internalized cystatin C appears to influence the balance between proteases and their inhibitors in cancer metastasis and growth, particularly when considering that it is a more efficient cathepsin B inhibitor than are cystatins A and B. It is possible that the intracellular increase in inhibitory capacity has an even greater impact on this balance than is suspected at first, because the cystatin molecules responsible for the increase are probably localized to, and hence concentrated in, just some cell compartments (e.g. endosomes).",

It seems possible that internalization will also be seen in normal cells, i.e. it is a general, physiological phenomenon, but this has to be investigated further. In conclusion, by using cell culture experiments and flow cytometry we were able to convincingly demonstrate that the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C is internalized in all five of the cancer cell lines investigated in this study. Using confocal microscopy, western blotting and quantification by ELISA, internalization of the cysteine inhibitor was verified and further delineated. Previously, target enzymes of this cysteine protease inhibitor have been shown to be involved in cell invasion and metastasis in cancer, and the cystatins have also been proposed to inhibit virus replication in cell cultures. Our findings open conceptually new lines of research in order to further elucidate the extension, the mechanism and the biological importance of this phenomenon.",
