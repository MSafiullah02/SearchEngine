This treatment experience was unconventional, poorly documented, and ethically complicated, and it has been dismissed by international scientists and health officials. Instead, this elite group has called for complex and costly \u2018top down\u2019 initiatives (directed by themselves and their chosen colleagues) to develop new treatments that target these viruses.

Later, in January 2015, WHO staff were told of the apparent success of treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with the statin/ARB combination (DS Fedson, unpublished observations); again they showed little interest. One month later, one of the healthcare workers who had treated some of these patients attended an Ebola meeting at WHO headquarters. When he was asked for information about his experience, he replied \u201cthe data will not be forthcoming\u201d (DS Fedson, unpublished observation). One of Sierra Leone\u2019s senior health officials later told an international journalist that statins and ARBs had never been given to Ebola patients (DS Fedson, unpublished observation), although there is incontrovertible evidence that contradicts his statement (DS Fedson, unpublished observation). Ebola scientists and WHO staff have never sought to directly validate the statin/ARB treatment experience in Sierra Leone, yet, it is difficult to imagine that local physicians would have treated such a large number of patients (when they were not obligated by a clinical trial protocol to do so) if treatment were having no effect on patient survival.",

In addition, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) has concluded that an uncontrolled clinical trial of a previously untested treatment can be considered in any situation in which (1) the disease has a uniformly poor prognosis; (2) no other treatment is available to serve as a control; (3) the proposed treatment is known to be safe; (4) the benefits of treatment would be sufficiently large to make interpretation of the results unambiguous; and (5) its underlying scientific rationale is so strong that a positive result should be widely accepted [23].

In response to this news, the Registrar of the PBSL asked local health officials and physicians several questions about how the drugs should be further studied. Two of these authors (SMO and DSF) learned of his inquiry and immediately wrote to the PBSL with suggestions on how these studies could be structured. They wrote several follow-up letters to the PBSL and also wrote to local physicians and government officials. In addition, DSF sent letters to Ebola scientists, physicians who had cared for Ebola virus-infected healthcare workers who had been evacuated, and to WHO and major institutions involved in the international Ebola response. The letters urged recipients to evaluate the statin/ARB treatment experience in Sierra Leone (e.g., by using a matched pair case\u2013control study) and undertake further studies of this treatment regimen [8, 9].

Drugs such as statins, ARBs, and other agents (e.g., PPAR and AMPK agonists) counteract endothelial dysfunction, but they also affect many other aspects of the host response: e.g., pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and redox metabolism, coagulation pathways, complement activity, macrophage and T cell polarization, and mitochondrial biogenesis (see Table 1 in [44]) [11]. They undoubtedly have major effects on immunometabolism [45, 46]. That said, several clinical trials and observational studies have failed to demonstrate convincingly that statin treatment by itself improves outcomes in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (there are few such studies of ARBs and other immunomodulatory drugs). The limitations of these studies have been discussed previously [11, 44].",

For this reason, they must vigorously advocate for and generously support the clinical trials needed to show convincingly whether these drugs will be effective. Clinical investigators should undertake these trials in patients with many forms of acute critical illness before the emergence of the next pandemic virus [55]. There is no guarantee that any of these trials will be successful, but if they are, the findings could be immensely important for global health, global equity, and global security. This is a lesson that physicians and public health officials in all countries must be prepared to learn.",
