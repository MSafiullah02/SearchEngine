Data from China revealed that 3.2% (2,583 of 79,824) of all confirmed COVID-19 cases required intubation and invasive ventilation [1] . A case series from Washington State showed that 12.5% of the 24 critically ill patients continued to receive mechanical ventilation at day 14 of their ICU admission [2] . One preliminary study from Italy showed that among 1300 patients, 88% of those hospitalized required mechanical ventilation and 58% of their patients still resided in the ICU 5 weeks after admission [3] . Similarly, in an article recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine describing hospitals in NYC, 33% of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation during the course of 4 to 5 weeks. Of those 130 patients that required intubation, only 33.1% were extubated at the time of publication. [4] .",

During the ICU course, the need for a tracheostomy in a COVID-19 patient will need to be entertained to avoid sequela from longterm intubation, simplification of care, ease of ventilator weaning, and improved patient mobility. However, performing a tracheostomy on a patient infected with corona virus places healthcare workers in an environment of high exposure to aerosolized airway secretions. There is a dearth of publications describing tracheostomy procedures performed in high risk patients infected with virulent respiratory pathogens such as SARS. Wei et al. reported his team's experience with 3 tracheostomy cases during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [5] . Our current COVID-19 pandemic has far outpaced the 2003 SARS epidemic in terms of the number of patients that are requiring mechanical ventilation [1] [2] [3] [4] . When approached to assist in a tracheostomy for a COVID-19 positive patient, a multi-disciplinary pre-procedure meeting should be called to assess the absolute need to perform the surgery. Meticulous and vigilant forethought and planning to mitigate the risk of infection must be made prior to initiating these procedures.",

Distracting alarms in the ICU and noise dampening PPE equipment can hinder hearing and effective communication during procedure. Under normal conditions, other personnel may be readily available to provide assistance when necessary. Due to the enormous risk of this type of procedure to healthcare workers, only the most experienced and minimal number of providers should be present in the procedure room. Vigilant communication between these individuals is crucial to coordinate pauses in ventilation prior to surgical airway entry as well as interruptions in circuit connections. Pausing ventilation prior to tracheal dilation minimizes the risk for aerosolization [5] . Furthermore, eliminating unnecessary circuit disconnects preserve PEEP and oxygenation for these patients with severe pulmonary impairments [5] .",
