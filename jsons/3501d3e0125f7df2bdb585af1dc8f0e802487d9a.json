Unlike healthy individuals where decreased hemoglobin levels and hypoxia trigger almost immediate production and release of EPO, this response is blunted in the critically ill patient. This blunted response can be explained by the high prevalence of renal failure in this population. In addition, infl ammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1) inhibit EPO gene transcription in renal juxtaglomerular cells and the response to EPO in the bone marrow, suppress iron release from storage sites, and increase iron sequestration.",

Serum iron is not a particularly reliable test because it is altered by a variety of conditions including infection, infl ammation, neoplasm, and liver disease. Its sensitivity and specifi city are 78 and 35 %, respectively, and thus it should not be used alone in determining the etiology of anemia. Serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant, is increased with chronic infl ammation, and can also be affected by acute infl ammation, infection, and malnutrition. Although a low ferritin level is highly suggestive of iron deficiency (sensitivity and specifi city are 71 and 69 %, respectively), an iron-defi cient patient can have a high ferritin level. The normal range for ferritin is between 100 and 800 ng/ml. Although cut-off values for iron supplementation in the ICU have not been established, some authors suggest using ferritin <100 ng/ml as an indication to begin iron therapy. Transferrin saturation provides information about the amount of iron available for erythropoiesis. The National Kidney Foundation recommends values of 20-50 %. Transferrin saturation of <20 % indicates diminished iron availability and depending on the clinical setting, the need for iron supplementation. However, in critically ill patients with low transferrin saturation and high ferritin levels, this can indicate functional iron defi ciency [ 2 ] .",

Critically ill patients have decreased circulating concentrations of EPO, as well as a blunted response to it, which initially increased interest in determining whether administration of exogenous EPO could improve outcomes. Several trials have since demonstrated that in the environment of restrictive transfusion, EPO therapy does not improve survival and may increase thrombotic complications. One potential explanation for this lack of effi cacy may be due to the signifi cant lag time between administering EPO and its onset of action. It is important to note that when EPO therapy is considered, it should always be given concomitantly with iron supplementation to ensure maximum benefi t. Neither epoetin alfa nor darbepoetin alfa (the latter having an increased half-life and bioactivity) are approved for the treatment of anemia of critical illness.",

Since both measurements represent concentration relative to volume, polycythemia can be classifi ed as relative or absolute. Relative polycythemia can occur when the plasma volume is reduced as a result of intravascular volume depletion (diarrhea, vomiting, massive capillary leak) which causes hemoconcentration.

Arterial thrombotic events are more common than venous events in patients with PV, with transient ischemic attacks, ischemic strokes, and myocardial infarctions being the most common thrombotic complications. Patients with PV who undergo surgical procedures are also at a higher risk of post-operative thrombotic complications. Secondary polycythemia is associated with hypoxemia due to cyanotic heart and/ or pulmonary disease. EPO production is triggered when PaO 2 is sustained at <67 mmHg. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), high altitude, tobacco use, and carbon monoxide poisoning are common conditions that have been linked to secondary polycythemia. Other less common conditions associated with secondary polycythemia are post-renal transplant erythrocytosis (found in up to 15 % of renal allograft recipients), renal cell carcinoma, polycystic kidney disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma. Polycythemia may also be secondary to drugs such as corticosteroids or androgens [ 10 ] .",

There are many different causes of neutropenia including congenital, infectious, autoimmune, nutritional defi ciencies, malignancy or drug-related. Because the underlying cause of neutropenia may also be associated with an increased risk of infection, it must also be considered when evaluating the patient. For example, patients with neutropenia due to leukemia have a much higher infection risk than those with ethnic neutropenia or chronic idiopathic neutropenia. The most frequent sites of infection in neutropenic patients are skin, oral mucosa and lungs. Importantly, the paucity of neutrophils results in a blunted immune response and decreased frequency or severity of the typical signs and symptoms of an infection.",

The onset of neutropenia is highly variable depending on the drug and can range from days to weeks after initiation. There are two mechanisms involved: repeated exposure causing myelosuppression, or intermittent exposure leading to immune-mediated antibody production. The latter is most commonly due to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and anti-thyroid medications. A bone marrow biopsy can elucidate the expected duration of neutropenia-if precursors are present but there are no mature cells, recovery can take 5-7 days. If no neutrophil precursors are present, recovery can take up to 14 days. With regard to treatment, the offending medication should be discontinued. There is no clear role for giving granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the setting of neutropenia induced by medications other than chemotherapeutics, but empirically administering broad spectrum antibiotics while awaiting count recovery is warranted if infection is suspected.",

Thrombocytopenia is a very common occurrence in the ICU, with studies reporting prevalence upon admission of 8-67 %. Furthermore, patients may develop thrombocytopenia during their ICU stay with an incidence ranging from 13 to 44 % [ 15 ] . Thrombocytopenia may impact both the treatment of critically ill patients (such as the risk of providing deep vein thrombosis [DVT] prophylaxis or performing invasive procedures) and their prognosis. Several studies have indicated that the development of thrombocytopenia is associated with increased length of stay and morbidity, and is an independent predictor of death. These associations have been noted in both pediatric and adult populations, as well as medical and surgical patients. Thrombocytopenia seems to be an especially strong mortality predictor in patients with sepsis. Not surprisingly, patients who develop thrombocytopenia have higher severity of illness scores and patients whose platelet counts do not recover or remain persistently low have a higher mortality. Although one of the most feared complications of severe thrombocytopenia is major bleeding, the cause of excess mortality in thrombocytopenic patients does not seem to be related to uncontrolled bleeding but rather to the process causing the severe thrombocytopenia [ 16 ] . Spontaneous bleeding is rarely seen unless platelet count is <10,000/\u03bcL.",

Expert opinion recommends 50,000/\u03bcL as a threshold for transfusion in patients undergoing invasive procedures. Platelet transfusion is relatively contraindicated in TTP and HIT because transfusion in these circumstances can fuel thrombosis and potentially have catastrophic consequences. In patients with ITP, immunoglobulin infusions may enhance the response to platelet transfusion in addition to being primarily therapeutic. With advancements of technology, 6-10 units of leukocyte-reduced platelets can be collected from a single donor in one pheresis setting, which can avoid pooling from multiple donors and decrease the incidence of alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. HLA-matched platelet transfusions are used in patients with alloimmunization.

Due to the importance of making a timely diagnosis and expeditiously initiating treatment, the current diagnostic criteria include only thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without an alternative cause [ 31 ] . Changes in the diagnostic criteria and the availability of effective treatment have led to an increase in the number of patients treated for TTP with plasma exchange. Acute idiopathic TTP, an autoimmune disease, is the most common form of TTP and is characterized by antibodies against ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase also known as von Willebrand Factor Cleaving Protease [ 32 ] . Other subtypes of TTP include HIV-associated, pregnancy-associated (5-25 % of cases), and drug-associated TTP (<15 % of cases). The diagnostic term HUS is used to refer to children who have thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in the presence of renal failure. Most children have a diarrhea prodrome, and plasma exchange is rarely used since supportive care is associated with good survival. The term HUS is not used to describe adults with the same criteria. Multiple disorders can occur similarly to TTP, such as disseminated carcinoma, infections, malignant hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), and renal disorders; therefore, it is important to consider and exclude alternative causes. ADAMTS13 activity <5 % is specifi c for TTP, but does not identify all patients that may relapse, whereas a level of <10 % may better capture patients at risk for relapse. However, an ADAMTS13 level of <10 % is not as specifi c for TTP and may also occur in patients with sepsis and cirrhosis.",

Estimated to occur in up to 1 % of transfusions, it can manifest within 1-2 h of transfusion with tachycardia, dyspnea, cough, hypertension with widened pulse pressure, and distended neck veins. Patients at risk include those with pre-existing cardiac or renal failure. Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive and includes supplemental oxygen, diuretic therapy, and in severe cases, positive pressure ventilation. Future transfusions in patient with TACO should be administered at a slower rate [ 36 ] . Mortality rate is reported to be between 3.6 and 20 %.",

Since citrate is metabolized in the liver, patients with liver failure and shock are at higher risk. Treatment includes correction of hypocalcemia and judicious use of blood products. Hyperkalemia occurs due to RBCs naturally leaking potassium during storage. Usually this is not a problem, unless the patient receives massive transfusion and has compromised cardiac, liver or renal function. Hypothermia (due to infusion of a large volume of cold blood products) can increase the toxicity of hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia leading to possible arrhythmias. In addition, hypothermia, together with acidosis, worsens coagulopathy. Blood warmers can prevent hypothermia but the temperature should be closely monitored since overheating blood products can induce hemolysis. Acidosis occurs due to the decreased pH of stored RBCs and tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of shock.",

Most current data on rFVIIa are from trauma patients and suggest that while it can reduce the use of RBCs it does not change the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate or platelet products, and does not affect mortality. PCC contains coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X and the anticoagulation proteins C and S and may especially benefi t patients with acute bleeding from coagulopathy related to vitamin K antagonism. Unlike FFP transfusion, which requires time to test for ABO compatibility, thawing and usually larger volumes to correct the coagulopathy, PCC can be administered very quickly and can correct the INR more predictably. TA is a synthetic derivative of lysine which inhibits fi brinolysis by blocking the lysine binding sites of plasminogen. TA has been successfully used in trauma patients and has been shown to reduce both the need for blood products and mortality. Additionally, it is often used off-label in hemophilia patients and perioperatively to reduce bleeding.",
