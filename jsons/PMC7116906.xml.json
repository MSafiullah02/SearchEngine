International Agency for Research on Cancer included BY2 among chemicals for which there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals due to its bio-transformation to reactive species in target organs of both rats and humans [2]. The conventional methods used in sewage treatment, such as primary and secondary treatment systems, are insufficient in removing of dyeing and finishing agent, for example: adsorption and chemical coagulation processes are two common techniques of wastewater treatment. However, these methods merely transfer dyes from the liquid to the solid phase causing secondary pollution and requiring further treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are alternative techniques of destruction of dyes and many other organics in wastewater and effluents. These processes, generally, involve UV/H2O2, UV/O3 or UV/Fenton's reagent for the oxidative degradation of contaminants. Semiconductor photocatalysis is another developed AOP, which can be conveniently applied to remove different organic pollutants [3], [4]. However, the potential of alternative AOPs to improve the removal performance is always of interest and the photochemical oxidant, peroxydisulfate, could be a good candidate for such a purpose.",

The peroxydisulfate is normally available as a salt associated with ammonium, sodium, or potassium. Potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) recently was shown to be an effective disinfectant and/or oxidant for the Norwalk virus, foot and mouth disease and Coronaviridae (causing severe acute respiratory syndromes SARS). It has also been reported to be effective for degrading organics in hazardous wastewaters in acidic or basic media through direct chemical oxidation (DCO), where peroxydisulfate is used as a sacrificial reagent [5], [6]. However, since the reactions of peroxydisulfate are generally slow at normal temperature, the thermal or photochemical activated decomposition of S2O8\n2\u2212 ion to S2O8\n2\u2212 radical has been proposed as a method of accelerating the process [6], as summarized in the following reactions:(1)S2O82\u2212 + photones or heat \u2192 2SO4\u2022\u2212\n(2)SO4\u2022\u2212 + RH2 \u2192 SO42\u2212 + H+ + RH\u2022\n(3)RH\u2022 + S2O82\u2212 \u2192 R + SO42\u2212 + H+ + SO4\u2022\u2212\n(4)SO4\u2022\u2212 + RH \u2192 R\u2022 + SO42\u2212 + H+\n(5)2R\u2022 \u2192 RR(dimer)(R is an organic material)",

Since peroxydisulfate will start reacting exothermally only at 100 \u00b0C [5], [6], it is not recommended for use in conventional water purification processes, other factors such as different light intensity, water pH, and temperature might also affect its decomposition rate.",

Although Graham et al. [5] recommended APS due to its exceptional solubility; we observed in our screening tests that KPS gave a more rapid removal of BY2 than APS at initial neutral pH. The difference in the removal efficiency is apparently due to the presence of the ammonium ion. The aqueous ammonium can undergo photo-oxidation [10] leading to nitrate and/or nitrite by the available oxidants in the solution, such as, S2O8\n2\u2212 and its related intermediates H2O2 or O2. Furthermore, the reaction of NH4\n+/NH3 with UV/S2O8\n2\u2212 process are proved to be able to convert it to nitrate under the 254 nm photolysis at a rate constant of 0.25 mg l\u22121\n min\u22121 or 4 \u00d7 10\u22123\n mM min\u22121\n[11], thereby making the ammonium a competitor of BY2.

            "text": "The concentration of S2O8\n2\u2212 was found to be an important parameter for the degradation of BY2 in the UV/S2O8\n2\u2212 system. The decay of BY2 was indicated in Fig. 5\n. For different S2O8\n2\u2212 concentrations that increased from 0.1 to 5 mM, the photooxidative reaction rate constants increased from 0.0042 to 0.0642 min\u22121, respectively. This is likely because sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals are generated simultaneously and improved the photooxidative decolorization of BY2 [5], [7]. Furthermore, when the S2O8\n2\u2212 concentration increased beyond 5 mM, the increment of BY2 decay rate slowed down slightly. According to Qiao et al. [12] at higher S2O8\n2\u2212 dosages, excessive generation of hydroxyl radicals (Eqs. (1), (6)) would be recombined to form less reactive H2O2 (Eq. (13)), which is a known quencher of OH\u2022 radical (Eq. (14)). Therefore, the rate increment of BY2 photooxidative decolorization is slightly slowed down at higher S2O8\n2\u2212 dosages. However, such a recombination effect of the radical is likely not very effective due to the low steady-state concentrations of the radicals; higher decay rates of BY2 at higher S2O8\n2\u2212 dosages are still expected.(13)2OH\u2022 \u2192 H2O2 (only in acidic to neutral pH)\n(14)OH\u2022 + H2O2 \u2192 H2O + HO2\u2022\n",

Although a high degree of photooxidative decolorization by the UV/S2O8\n2\u2212 process was observed, at all tested pH levels, the decolorization performance increased from low to initial neutral pH (pH 6.72) levels but decreased under basic conditions as shown in Fig. 7. This is likely due to the concentration effect of active radicals in the solution. The BY2 decay increment from acidic to initial neutral pH is known due to the increase of OH\u2212, which induces a higher generation of OH\u2022, and therefore the photooxidative decolorization efficiency. However, the decreasing photodecay at pH \u2265 7 can be explained by the following reasons: (a) the instability of H2O2 at high pH level, (b) relatively higher amounts of OH\u2022 and SO4\n\u2022\n\u2212 were generated catalytically in alkaline conditions, which induced recombination of these two radicals (Eq.
