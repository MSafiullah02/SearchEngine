Aspergillus fumigatus, the most pathogenic species, is responsible for about 90% of all cases of invasive aspergillosis (64). There are three main clinical syndromes caused by A. fumigatus, which has the greatest predilection of all species for the respiratory tract (60). Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity reaction to the colonization of the airways/sinuses/lungs with Aspergillus spp, which predominantly affects patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. The clinical syndrome of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis affects approximately 1% of those with asthma and 5\u201310% of those with cystic fibrosis (92). Aspergilloma is an infection of a pre\u2010existing pulmonary cavity with a mycetoma (fungal ball) of Aspergillus species. This has a variable prevalence depending on the amount of cavitating lung disease affecting the population in question (33). Invasive aspergillosis is a disseminated infection affecting immunocompromised individuals that often starts in the lungs but may involve other organs and tissues by hematogenous spread. Invasive aspergillosis is extremely rare amongst immunocompetent patients.

Aspergillus spp are universally distributed and are found in soil and other organic matter. Four other Aspergillus spp cause most of the remaining cases of aspergillosis, namely Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus nidulans. A. terreus is associated with high mortality. A. flavus may cause sinusitis more commonly. A. niger is a more frequent colonizing species and is commonly associated with external otitis. A. nidulans is particularly associated with infection in chronic granulomatous disease (5). A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus with a worldwide distribution, which is a result, in part, of the production of small spores called conidia that have an average size of 2\u20133.5 \u03bcm. These are easily dispersed into the air and remain in the atmosphere for prolonged periods of time, but are dependent upon the external environment, such as temperature, humidity and seasonal variations (108). The spores of A. fumigatus have a hydrophobic protein\u2010coat layer, which may enable them to withstand host defences and harsh environments. In addition, their very small size enables penetration deep into the lung, particularly A. fumigatus. All Aspergillus spp also form hyphae, which are septate and hyaline. This is one of the key virulence factors of Aspergillus and is required for tissue invasion. A. fumigatus grows the most rapidly, is extremely thermotolerant, and binds laminin and fibrinogen more efficiently than other species of Aspergillus, making it a\u2010well adapted pathogen. The morphology and colour of the conidiophores vary between species (59).",

Cough may be severe, resulting in expectoration of large mucous plugs and hemoptysis, which may be coupled with generalized malaise and severe headache. Aspergilloma may present with hemoptysis, which can be life\u2010threatening. Cough and/or fever are less frequent. The condition may be asymptomatic, and can be detected after radiographic changes in patients with pre\u2010existing cavitating lung disease. Invasive aspergillosis presents with a cough combined with a fever, shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. Pneumonic consolidation may develop with a rapidly worsening clinical condition and severe hypoxia, including hemoptysis. The fungus may spread in the blood and affect the kidneys, brain, heart, spleen, liver, thyroid, gastrointestinal tract and eyes (52).",

            "text": "Diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult, and requires a high index of suspicion. Histopathology of lung biopsies remains the \u2018gold standard\u2019. The presence of acute dichotomous branching septate filamentous forms invading tissue combined with a pure culture is diagnostic (115). Chest radiographic features are also important, but not in the early stages of disease. Signs include bronchopneumonia, consolidation, segmental pneumonia, multiple nodules, masses, cavitary lesions and pleural effusion. Computed tomography scans of the chest reveal multiple nodules and the characteristic halo sign. Culture from bronchoalveloar lavage often provides a useful indicator of infection and adjunct to other diagnostic tests (5). More recent advances have seen the use of galactomannan detection by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay. Galactomannan is a cell wall polysaccharide that can be detected in blood at levels as low as 0.5 ng/ml, and prior to the development of clinical signs. However, although it provides a high negative predictor of infection, it is limited by a poor positive predictive value as a result of cross\u2010reactivity with other species and/or foodstuffs. Beta\u2010d\u2010glucan is another recent antigenic detection test that appears a promising addition to the diagnostic arsenal. Prospective clinical trials are necessary to evaluate this technology further. The PCR is a further test that is currently under development, which may offer both high specificity and sensitivity (53). However, distinguishing infection from colonization, and optimizing specimen collection, are problematic.",

Aspergilloma may be treated surgically, but this has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. For an aspergilloma, percutaneous administration with amphotericin B may be performed, but some studies show no apparent benefit. Conversely, itraconazole shows limited success because of its high tissue penetration. In terms of invasive aspergillosis (IA), amphotericin B has been the first\u2010line therapy for aspergillosis for many years, but is associated with serious side effects, such as nephrotoxicity. However, liposomal formulations of these have been introduced that have fewer side effects (29). Voriconazole, a broad\u2010spectrum triazole, has recently been approved for the treatment of IA because it has more favourable outcomes than amphotericin B and fewer side effects. Other azoles include posaconazole, which may be used as salvage therapy when conventional antifungals fail. The echinocandins such as caspofungin, which are cell wall inhibitors, have been introduced and used for salvage therapy (32). Although limited clinical study data are currently available, there is potential for combination therapy of the echinocandin with liposomal amphotericin B or the triazoles (91). Prophylaxis of high\u2010risk patient groups is preferential, as itraconazole can be used with relative effectiveness. In addition, there are reports of immunotherapy for managing patients with invasive aspergillosis. These include colony\u2010stimulating factors, such as granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor, granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor, or interferon\u2010\u03b3 (81).

It is a ubiquitous encapsulated round\u2010to\u2010oval yeast\u2010like fungus measuring 4\u20136 \u03bcm. It is initially inhaled prior to causing the disease coccoccosis, affecting immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS, immune deficiencies, cancer, steroid use and diabetes (88). It possesses a characteristic polysaccharide capsule of variable thickness (up to 30 \u03bcm) that surrounds the yeasts. Within the environment the capsule is thinner and the yeast smaller, while thicker capsules tend to be found in infected tissues. The polysaccharide capsule, the phenoloxidase enzyme and the organism\u2019s ability to grow at 37 \u00b0C, are its major virulence factors (78). Respiratory manifestations of the disease can be both acute and chronic. Acute forms of the disease are rare, occurring in patients with AIDS and presenting as severe acute respiratory distress. Chronic pulmonary forms are associated with the production of nodules or masses (usually in the upper lobes), cavities, segmental pneumonia, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy. Histologically, these infections appear with inflammation of a gelatinous appearance (88). This is composed of yeast cells that become granulomatous. Diagnoses can be made directly through visualization of the yeast cells in biopsy samples or from isolation. Indirect diagnosis can be made from detection of the cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen using commercially available latex agglutination assays (79).",

A few cases of P. jiroveci pneumonia occur in otherwise healthy children, but by far the most important expression of the disease is in the immunocompromised, especially in patients with AIDS (101).

A number of respiratory tract infections (including legionellosis and tuberculosis) can potentially be transmitted during dental treatment. Aspiration pneumonias associated with members of the oral flora are common among hospitalized, debilitated patients. In tuberculosis, there is global concern about antibiotic resistance, particularly among those strains known as XDR TB, which are virtually impossible to treat with chemotherapeutic agents. The influenza virus H5N1A is causing widespread concern, because of the potential for a pandemic if a strain develops that can transmit readily between humans. On a more positive note, improved understanding of the genetics and epidemiology of two important bacterial pathogens, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, have resulted in significant advances in prevention, through improved vaccine availability and effectiveness. Respiratory tract infections will continue to be prevalent in all human populations and provide an ongoing challenge for modern medicine.",
