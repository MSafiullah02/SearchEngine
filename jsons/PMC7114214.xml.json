            "text": "Graphene, a free-standing 2D crystal with one-atom thickness, has become one of the hottest topics in the fields of materials science, physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology [7]. This allotrope of carbon comprises layers of six-atom rings in a honeycombed network and can be conceptually viewed as a true planar aromatic macromolecule [8]. As a basic building block of other carbon allotropes, graphene can be wrapped to generate 0D fullerenes, rolled up to form 1D carbon nanotubes, and stacked to produce 3D graphite [9] (Figure 1a). Although graphene is the fundamental basis of different carbon forms, it was first prepared unambiguously in 2004, 440 years after the invention of graphite, by peeling a single layer of graphene using sticky tape and a pencil [10]. During the past several years, various methods for producing graphene have been developed, such as micromechanical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition, epitaxial growth, and chemically synthesis (see Box 1\nfor more details). Graphene samples produced by chemical method are also called chemically modified graphene (CMG). Here, we use graphene and graphene-based nanomaterial to define the graphene materials referred to in this review.Box 1Methods for production of graphene and graphene-based nanomaterialsGraphene was first prepared in 2004 by peeling a single layer of graphene using sticky tape and a pencil [10]. During the past several years, various methods for producing graphene have been developed, such as micromechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth or chemical vapour deposition (CVD) epitaxial growth, and chemical synthesis from graphite.The sticky tape and pencil strategy is also considered as the micromechanical exfoliation or peel-off method, which can be used successfully against the strong exfoliation energy of the \u03c0-stacked layers in graphite, to produce pure and single-layered graphene sheets with a honeycomb lattice. However, this process has a disadvantage in terms of yielding small samples. A method of liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in surfactant/water solutions has been demonstrated recently. This method produces graphene that consists of 40% of sheets thinner than five layers and about 3% monolayers [70].Graphene synthesis by epitaxy on transition metals has been reported. For example, epitaxial growth of single- and multi-layered graphene epitaxy on Ru (0001) has been observed by in situ surface microscopy, with characterization by electron scattering and microscopy [71]. CVD epitaxial growth is another approach for production of graphene, by dissolving carbon into a nickel substrate, and then forcing it to precipitate out by cooling the nickel. The thickness and crystalline ordering of the precipitated carbon is controlled by the cooling rate and concentration of carbon dissolved in the nickel. After chemical etching of the nickel, the graphene membrane detaches and can be transferred to another substrate [72].Chemical synthesis of graphene from graphite is becoming a promising method with some advantages such as scalable, high-volume production and ease of chemical modification. However, the chemical approach does introduce some defects in graphene during the oxidation or reduction steps, and results in structural damage of the graphene. Hence, graphene produced by chemical methods is also called CMG in some reports and reviews [73]. Here, we use the terms graphene and graphene-based nanomaterial. Briefly, the chemical method for graphene production involves initial oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide, followed by mechanical or thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide to GO sheets. GO sheets are hydrophilic, oxygenated graphene sheets and graphite oxide is a layered material that consists of GO sheets, which bear oxygen functional groups on their basal planes and edges. To derive graphene from GO, chemical reduction is the final step to remove the functional groups, which makes the product strongly hydrophilic. Reduction of GO to graphene can be carried out by using reducing chemical agents such as hydroquinone, dimethylhydrazine and hydrazine hydrate, electrochemical reduction [74], thermal reduction [75], and photocatalytic reduction [76].",

            "text": "Although it is considered as the basic block of carbon allotropes, graphene exhibits distinctly different properties, such as its unusual structural characteristics and electronic flexibility 11, 12, 13. Other extraordinary properties include high planar surface (calculated value, 2630 m2/g) [14], superlative mechanical strength (Young's modulus, \u223c1100 GPa) [15], unparalleled thermal conductivity (\u223c5000 W/m/K) [16], and remarkable electronic properties. Typically, the notable electronic characteristics of graphene are a high integer quantum Hall effect at room temperature [17]; a Dirac fermion system with linear energy dispersion [18]; an ambipolar electric field effect, along with ballistic conduction of charge carriers [19]; and electron-hole symmetry and freedom internal degree [20]. For example, electronic dispersion in the graphene lattice is shown in Figure 1c. According to the linear dispersion of the electron energy (E) with respect to the wave vector (k), the Dirac equation that describes the linear E-k relation is E=\u210f\u03bdFkx2+ky2, where the Fermi velocity v\nF is about 106 m/s. It is expected that quasiparticles in graphene behave differently from those in conventional metals and semiconductors, which exhibit a parabolic dispersion relation [21]. Specific information on graphene synthesis, as well as its chemical and physical properties, has been discussed in several reviews 6, 7, 9, 13, 22, 23, 24.",

Importantly, ssDNA can be strongly interfaced onto the graphene surface. In particular, the tethering process of ssDNA on graphene is preferential on thicker sheets (\u223c8 nm), and on wrinkled rather than flat surfaces of chemically modified graphene. Patterning ssDNA on graphene layers increases the hole-density in the graphene layer in the order of 5.61\u00d71012/cm2. The resultant ssDNA\u2013graphene biointerface has been used in a field-effect transistor (FET) for the label-free, reversible detection of complementary ssDNA [40]. Through a self-assembly process under strong ultrasonication, monolayers of ssDNA molecules have been adsorbed on both sides of graphene sheets by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking [41]. In another example, graphene adsorbed with ssDNA has been used directly for the study of surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) [42]. Graphene efficiently preconcentrated the ssDNA and served as a direct platform for SELDI-TOF-MS analysis. Another elegant approach of graphene tethering with DNA includes formation of nanoparticles (NPs) decorated with graphene biosystems. Thiolated ssDNA is first adsorbed onto GO sheets. The resultant thiol-DNA\u2013GO sheet is used as a 2D bionanointerface for assembly of gold NPs. Furthermore, the gold NPs maintain optical properties after assembly [43].",

Then, peptide/graphene core/shell nanowires were immediately created as soon as an organic peptide solution (100 mg/ml solution of diphenylalanine in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol) was diluted in aqueous graphene dispersion under mild mechanical shaking.

As a result of the FRET effect between FAM and GO, fluorescence is quenched rapidly; however, binding between probe ssDNA and a complementary ssDNA alters the conformation, and consequently, releases FAM\u2013ssDNA from the GO surface and results in fluorescence recovery. Detection of cDNA is therefore realized. Similarly, multicolor DNA analysis has been accomplished with graphene-based FRET biosensors [56]. The planar GO surface allows simultaneous quenching of multiple ssDNA probes labeled with different dyes, which leads to a multicolor sensor for the detection of multiple DNA targets. In this case, a graphene-based FRET biosensor is able to detect different DNA targets with various sequences by using ssDNA probes with different sequences. In another example, a graphene-based FRET platform has been developed for detection of helicase-mediated unwinding of duplex DNA [55]. By reliance on the preferential binding of GO to ssDNA over dsDNA, the dsDNA substrate that contains a fluorescent dye at the end of one strand is prepared first. As helicase unwinding of dsDNA proceeds, the fluorescence decreases and is quenched completely because of strong interaction of GO with unwound ssDNA. Helicase activity can thus be monitored in real time.",

Typically, the two ends of an MB are labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher. MBs do not fluoresce until they have hybridized with the target NAs. The unique thermodynamics and specificity of MBs have led to their broad application in biotechnology [58]. However, the dual labeling limits the preparation of MBs, and variable or residual fluorescence can limit detection sensitivity. In studies of MB-based FRET biosensors, graphene can serve as a nanoquencher for fluorophores as well as a nanoscaffold for MBs. The incorporation of graphene into a MB-based FRET biosensor not only provides a more convenient synthesis/purification protocol compared to conventional MBs, but also improves the sensitivity. As an example, GO has been employed as the \u2018nanoquencher\u2019, with increased sensitivity and single-base mismatch selectivity for target DNA [59]. An MB-based GO FRET biosensor has also been integrated with QDs as fluorophores owning to its broad absorption and narrow emission spectra [58]. The MB-QD GO-based FRET biosensor has displayed good selectivity and high sensitivity, with a detection limit for target cyclin DNA of 12 nM (Table 1), and could be used for quantification of NAs and for single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.",

Aptamers boast high specificity to a wide range of targets, which is advantageous for many bio-analytical applications (reviewed in [53]). By using aptamers as probes, we can extend the targeting field of graphene-based FRET biosensors from DNA to ions, small molecules, and proteins. Ag+ ion detection has been realized by using GO and an Ag+-specific aptamer [60]. The target-induced conformational change of the aptamer leads to the recovery of FAM fluorescence. Ag+ ions can be easily differentiated when some other metal ions are present with a 10-fold higher concentration, which demonstrates a sensitive responding ability of the proposed graphene FRET biosensor. Another highly specific FRET sensor has been developed for detection of bovine thrombin, based on a dye-labeled aptamer probe and graphene 54, 61. To obtain a good water-dispersion graphene sample, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) has been used for the chemical reduction of graphite oxide to produce SDBS-graphene [61]. Thrombin aptamer labeled with FAM was first incubated with SDBS\u2013graphene. When thrombin was introduced into the aptamer/graphene solution, obvious fluorescence recovery was observed. This is mainly due to the quadruplex structure formed by thrombin and its aptamer, which owns the weak affinity to graphene. The graphene-based FRET aptasensor has a sensitive detection ability for thrombin in buffer (down to 31.3 pM) and in serum solutions (Table 1). The graphene-based FRET aptasensor has exhibited an extraordinary response in buffer and serum solutions.",

For example, a graphene-based FET has been used to investigate electrogenic cells [64]. The FET conductance signals that are recorded from beating chicken embryonic cardiomyocytes yields well-defined extracellular signals with a signal-to-noise ratio routinely above 4, which exceeds typical values for other planar devices. A graphene-based FET (with active channel of 20.8 \u00d7 9.8 \u03bcm) has also been used as a biosensor to detect hormonal catecholamine molecules in neuroendocrine PC12 rat adrenal medulla cells [65].

            "text": "Another exciting area of graphene research is drug delivery in living cells. For instance, modified GO has been investigated as a cargo for the delivery of water-soluble cancer drugs [66]. Nanoscale GO (NGO) was first functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to render high solubility in aqueous solutions, as well as stability in physiological solutions, such as serum. A water-insoluble aromatic molecule, SN38, has been attached to PEGylated NGO (NGO-PEG). Finally, the NGO-PEG\u2013SN38 complex exhibits high potency with IC50 values of 6 nM for HCT-116 human colon cancer cells, which is 1000-fold more potent than camptothecin (CPT-11), and has similar potency to that of free SN38 [67]. To enhance the loading efficiency and targeting ability of anticancer drugs, NGO can be covalently modified with folic acid (FA) [68]. Controlled loading of two anticancer drugs, doxorubicin and CPT-11 onto the FA-conjugated NGO (FA-NGO) has been investigated. In this case, FA-NGO loaded with the two anticancer drugs shows specific targeting to MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and remarkably high cytotoxicity compared to unmodified NGO loaded with doxorubicin or irinotecan. In a final example, PEG-modified nanoscale graphene sheets (NGSs) have been prepared, and the strong optical absorbance of NGSs in the near-infrared region has been utilized to achieve ultra-high in vivo tumor uptake of anticancer drugs, which can be used for photothermal therapy of cancer [69]. The behavior of PEGylated NGSs in mice has been studied by fluorescence imaging, and surprisingly high tumor accumulation was observed. NGSs with a biocompatible coating might therefore constitute a novel type of 2D nanomaterial with great potential in cancer therapy. With the success of the above studies, it is likely that graphene-based nanocarriers will find widespread application in biomedicine in the future.",

However, the merging of graphene and biotechnology is in its infancy, with many challenges remaining. Control of the size and number of single layers of graphene separated from bulk graphite might be the foremost challenge for the application of graphene as the building block of functionalized biosystems. Pristine graphene possesses a super quenching ability for FRET applications, but it is highly hydrophobic. Likewise, GO has been widely used in the fields of FRET biosensor studies because of its good solubility, but it is lack of super fast electron transfer. Preparation of soluble, well-defined graphene or graphene derivates with high quenching efficiency is another challenge. Cytotoxicity, the cellular uptake mechanism, and the intracellular metabolic pathway of graphene and its derivates remain almost unknown, which are highly important research areas and are crucial if we are going to use graphene in living cell studies and for in vivo applications.",
