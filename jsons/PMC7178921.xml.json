Given its status as an international hub with close geographical and business ties to China, Singapore was a natural route of dissemination. Indeed, by early February 2020, our densely populated urban island nation had the second most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of China [2]. At the onset, there was admittedly some panic, largely due to gaps in knowledge about the virus. Misinformation being circulated did not help; some early rumors suggested that the primary mode of spread was via aerosol transmission. Most evidence today suggests COVID-19 primarily spreads by way of large droplets [3].",

Given the heterogeneous patient population coursing through any radiology department, definitions of how to categorize patients into non-suspect, suspect, and confirmed COVID-19 cases allow ground staff to understand which patients they can use standard precautions on versus those that require enhanced measures and additional personal protective equipment. In the earlier days of the outbreak, it was much easier to risk stratify patients; symptomatic patients with recent travel to Hubei Province or with occupational exposure to Chinese tourists were deemed at risk for COVID-19. With the recent global explosion of cases in Europe and America with known community spread, it is becoming more challenging to categorize patients into different risk categories and there may be a time in the near future when anybody coming into the radiology division may well be a possible COVID-19 case, and sustainable enhanced universal precautions are likely to become the \u201cnew normal.\u201d",

However, PCR testing may not be sensitive enough to exclude COVID-19, and many patients may need radiological investigations prior to disease confirmation [6, 7]. To image these patients, we have taken additional safety measures at the expense of patient throughput. For general radiography and ultrasound, we have leveraged upon the use of portable examinations to minimize patient movement. For examinations, we lack portable capability for, including MRI and CT, carefully planned routes of transportation ensure minimal spread of pathogen and contact with personnel [4]. Simulation of these transfers have helped identify gaps in the process and should be carefully rehearsed. Further, as far as possible, we have performed examinations for all suspect or confirmed cases in negative pressure CT and MRI rooms, installed in response to our previous 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, and use full personal protective equipment [8]. Meticulous vetting of examinations is being made to ensure examinations are being done appropriately and add value to patient care [4]. Decontamination for portable x-ray machines includes surface cleaning to the entire machine with standard anti-microbial wipes. Our CT procedure for COVID-19 patients includes wrapping potential contact areas (gantry, couch, injector controls) with plastic covering; after the plastic is removed, we use standard anti-microbial wipes to clean the machine, and then proceed with terminal cleaning and UV-C irradiation to the scan room. The decontamination process for portable x-ray and CT takes 20 min and 90 min, respectively.",
