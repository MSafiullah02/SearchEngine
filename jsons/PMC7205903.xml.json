A novel coronavirus, initially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of this disease by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (3). This disease, now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO, rapidly spread to other cities of China, and has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) following its global spread. COVID-19 clinically manifests as fever, cough, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea and pneumonia, and can cause death in severe cases (4\u20136). Up through March 20, 2020, China has reported 81008 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 3,255 fatalities (7).",

A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts (4\u20136). However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated. We retrospectively analyze here the clinical data from 522 cases of COVID-19 who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theater Command and Hanyang Hospital in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020. We also compare the expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Our results thus provide a preliminary demonstration of T cell exhaustion during COVID-19 infection and suggest that more urgent, early intervention may be required in patients with low T lymphocyte counts.",

Within the analyzed cohort, 43 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of <300 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation of 93% or lower. According to the staging of infectious disease (10), the prodromal period is a phase in which the host begins to experience general signs and symptoms. The illness period (overtly symptomatic period) is a phase in which the signs or symptoms of disease are most obvious and severe, with positive laboratory findings and chest/lung pathological manifestations. For ICU patients, ICU period is a phase in which the symptoms are most obvious and severe. The decline period is a phase in which the clinical symptoms begin to decline, laboratory findings and chest pathological signs improve, and arterial oxygen saturation normalizes.",

Among milder disease patients in the Non-ICU group, the median value of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were 652, 342, and 208, respectively; the median value decreased to 261, 198, and 64.3, respectively, in the ICU group (Figure 1A). The counts of total T cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in ICU patients than Non-ICU cases (Figure 1B). All these patients were further categorized into three groups based on age (<20 years old, 20\u201359 years and \u226560 years), and an age-dependent reduction of T cell numbers was observed in COVID-19 patients, with the lowest T cells numbers found in patients \u226560 years old (Figure 1C), suggesting a potential cause for increased susceptibility in elderly patients. It is worth noting that the age range of the ICU patients was 26\u201387 years [64.5 (53\u201370.75), Median (IQR)], suggesting that some young patients can become critically ill.",

Interestingly, serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly decreased in these patients in the decline (i.e., disease resolution) compared to the illness period, while counts of total T cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets recovered during the decline period (Figure 2C). We also noted that serum levels of IL-2 and IL-4 had no difference between these two periods (Supplementary Figure 1B).

Similarly, higher percentages of Tim-3+ cells were observed in CD4+ T cells from patients in the ICU stage, although PD-1 expression in CD4+ T cells was not obviously affected during disease progression (Figures 3C,D). Furthermore, PD-1 and Tim-3 protein expression tended to increase throughout the stages discussed above in PD-1+ or Tim-3+ CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Figure 1C).

However, persistent stimulation by the virus may induce T cell exhaustion, leading to loss of cytokine production and reduced function (15, 16). Earlier studies have been unclear regarding the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients, albeit with suggestions of depressed lymphocyte counts (4, 6). In this report, we retrospectively reviewed the numbers of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets in a total of 499 COVID-19 patients. In Non-ICU patients, we found that over 70.56% cases had a decrease in total, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, in the ICU group, a total of 95% (19/20) patients showed a decrease in both total T cells and CD4+ T cells, and most importantly, all of the patients displayed decreases in CD8+ T cells. We also analyzed Non-ICU patients in greater detail, and found that urgent intervention may be necessary to preempt the development of severe symptoms in patients with low T cell counts.",

Dysregulated and continual synthesis of IL-6 has been shown to play a pathological role in chronic inflammation and infection (25, 26).

            "text": "The source of these cytokines during COVID-19 disease remains an open interesting issue. While previous studies have validated that the secretion of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1, mostly derives from T cells, macrophages and monocytes etc. (30, 31), based on our (inverse correlation) results, we suggest that the secretion of these cytokines does not originate from T cells. However, the cytokine storm in turn may promote apoptosis or necrosis of T cells, and consequently leads to their reduction. Our previous work demonstrated that monocytes and macrophages can produce pro-inflammatory cytokine during murine hepatitis virus strain-3 infection (32, 33), yet whether SARS-CoV-2 also triggers cytokine release from monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients needs further investigation and current work around this is in progress in our hospital.",

            "text": "T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction that arises during many chronic infections and cancer. It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells (34). By FACS analysis, we found that both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells have higher levels of PD-1 in virus infected patients, particularly in ICU patients (Figure 3). IL-10, an inhibitory cytokine, not only prevents T cell proliferation, but also can induce T cell exhaustion. Importantly, blocking IL-10 function has been shown to successfully prevent T cell exhaustion in animal models of chronic infection (35, 36). We demonstrate here that COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-10 following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also displaying high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their T cells, suggesting that IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible. The application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to T cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery. We have read with great interest the successful application of Remdesivir to cure a COVID-19 patient in the US, and clinical trials indicate that this drug may have significant potential as an antiviral (37, 38).",
