The second principle underlines their joint commitment to the public to enhance the quality of this workforce through appropriate standards for physician certification and appropriate accreditation of training programs, including adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology.15 The third principle in this joint statement is that during the stressful period of the pandemic crisis, assessment by the program clinical competency committee and the program director guides the decision-making as to whether a trainee is ready for independent practice and assessment of board eligibility. This is especially important when time-and volume-based standards for cases and procedures are adjusted due to the extended nature of the coronavirus crisis.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The fourth guiding principle is that these assessments should be thorough and multimodal, including direct observation, simulation, quality improvement, case logs, procedural logs, and multi-source feedback.15 The fifth and final principle is that the assessments by the program director and clinical competency committee are a core responsibility for the sake of patients, fellow trainees, and the public.15 This set of principles from the ACGME and the ABMS provide guidance for both the fellows and program leadership about the process for determining trainee readiness for graduation.",

The NBE administers the examination of special competence in advanced perioperative transesophageal echocardiography that has become a benchmark for recognized excellence in echocardiography for fellows in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology.6, 7 The typical requirements to be eligible for this board-style examination are fully explained in the handbook, but do include a total of 300 echocardiographic examinations, of which at least 150 must be personally performed by the applicant under the supervision of a board-certified perioperative echocardiographer.15 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NBE has announced a postponement of the administration date for this examination until September 2020 (www.echoboards.org, last accessed April 17th 2020). It is likely that the NBE will also modify the volume-based procedural requirements for this examination, given the protracted nature of the pandemic and the consequent attrition in perioperative echocardiography due to cancellation of elective cardiac surgical cases as part of the surge planning for COVID-19.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n",

Each hospital will have developed their own general policy with a staged approach to redeployment of services. The program leadership should engage in the decision-making process and communicate clearly with the fellows regarding their potential new roles, the expected duration of redeployment in the setting of adequate supervision, training and respect of duty hours. Regarding deployment duties, consideration should be given to each fellow's individual background; for example, whether they completed internship and/or residency at their current institution or have additional advanced training in arenas such as critical care. Their redeployment should serve, as much as possible, in balance with their ACGME described fellowship roles but be viewed, overall, as an opportunity to emerge as leaders amongst the residents in modeling flexibility and professionalism in clinical care.",
