            "text": "Many factors contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance (See Fig. 1); antibiotic usage is considered the most important factor promoting the emergence, selection and dissemination of antibiotic\u2010resistant microorganisms in both veterinary and human medicine (Marshall and Levy, 2011), and exposure to livestock is a risk factor for emerging zoonotic diseases, including antimicrobial\u2010resistant pathogens, coronaviruses (SARS, MERS) and filoviruses (Ebola) (Morens et al., 2004). In the modern poultry industry, antimicrobials are used in high quantities \u2013 not only for therapy and prevention of bacterial disease but also as antimicrobial growth promoters (AMGPs) in animal feeds \u2013 which may constitute the greatest selection pressure for the emergence of resistance (Angulo et al., 2009; Marshall and Levy, 2011). The faecal flora of chickens, for example, contains a relatively high proportion of resistant bacteria. Studies from high\u2010income countries have reported that poultry are a source of antibiotic resistance for poultry farm workers (van den Bogaard et al., 2002; Price et al., 2007). Studies from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMIC) have shown that poultry farm workers and their family members are at an increased risk for carriage of antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria and diarrhoeal pathogens than the general population (Al\u2010Ghamdi et al., 1999; Raghunath, 2008; Donkor et al., 2012) (See Fig. 1). In LMIC, people generally live in closer contact with livestock than in high\u2010income countries (HIC) and this is linked to increased risk for diarrhoeal diseases (Al\u2010Ghamdi et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 2003) (See Fig. 1). Limited data are available on household\u2010level antibiotic use for humans in Bangladesh, and no data exist on household\u2010level antibiotic use for animals in Bangladesh or in other low\u2010income countries (Hossain et al., 1982). One of the few published studies on human antibiotic use in Bangladesh suggested a high rate of medicine use; 189 individuals took 261 drugs, patients rarely obtained a full prescription, and about 95% of purchases were from private pharmacies (Hossain et al., 1982). According to this study, there was minimal antibiotic use in animals and none in animal feed in the early 1980s. An extensive literature review did not uncover any additional references on antibiotic use in Bangladesh.",

In Bangladesh, specifically, there are no published data available on animal healthcare practices at the household level. This study was conducted to (i) quantify animal health treatment practices at the household level, specifically antibiotic use, animal healthcare provider utilization and animal medicine sources; (ii) quantify animal husbandry practices that increase the risk for the potential transmission of antibiotic resistance determinants from animals to humans in the study area; and (iii) compare healthcare seeking and treatment trends for household members and animals.",

Projahnmo was a 3\u2010year trial to evaluate the impact of a package of obstetric and neonatal care that includes community health education, clean delivery, essential newborn care and management of neonatal infections in north\u2010east Bangladesh.

A list of households that met these eligibility criteria was generated from a census carried out by Projahnmo (Baqui et al., 2008). From this list, an equal number of households were randomly selected from low (\u22641 USD/day), medium (1.01\u20133.99 USD/day) and high socio\u2010economic status (SES) groups (>4 USD/day) to identify differences in animal husbandry practices by SES using cut\u2010off values previously defined (Baqui et al., 2008). An equal number of women with young children from each of the SES strata were then randomly selected because they were believed to be a good source for information on both human and animal medicine use and care and were most likely to be at home during the day when interviews were conducted.",

The qualitative research uncovered important themes related to antibiotic use that this study quantified (Roess et al., 2013). The qualitative research uncovered local language terminology for animal husbandry practices including types of treatments (antibiotics and feed additives) given to livestock and animal health problems (poor growth, diarrhoea). These terms were used in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to elicit information on and quantify (i) human and animal medicine use at the household level, (ii) animal husbandry practices and (iii) human and animal healthcare provider utilization in rural Bangladesh. The dependent variable of interest was reported recent animal treatment (animal treatment was defined as seeking advice for addressing an animal health concern) within the 6 months prior to the survey. Possible factors associated with recent animal treatment were recorded, including socio\u2010economic and demographic factors, specifically household structure, drinking water source and education status; type of animal healthcare provider (homoeopath, drug seller, village doctor, veterinarian); ownership of animals (type of animal, number of animals); type of animal illness; characteristics of the use of medicine for household members (type of medicine, source of medicine, purpose of medicine use); and household member farm worker status (any member working on a farm, any poultry farm workers, any dairy farm workers, any agricultural farm workers). Each of these factors has been shown to have an association with human medicine use variables (Radyowijati and Haak, 2001). Because limited literature is available on household\u2010level animal medicine use and because literature has described animals as an important investment, we hypothesized that some of the same socio\u2010economic factors influencing household\u2010level human antibiotic use would also influence animal antibiotic use.",

We surveyed 700 households because this was the sample size required to meet the objectives of the larger study (Roess, 2006). At the end of the survey, interviewers inquired whether a male animal caretaker was available to answer animal health questions, and in 117 households, we were able to collect animal healthcare data from both male and female members of the household for data triangulation.",

The majority of treatments were recommended by a fellow household member (61.6%) (Fig. 1). Additives, medicines and injections were the most common treatments reported (39%, 23.3% and 18.1%, respectively). Based on the results of the preceding qualitative study, we determined that the term \u2018additive\u2019 referred to commercial feed which contained grains and sometimes antimicrobials and \u2018medicines\u2019 referred to antibiotics in the majority of instances [we also compared terms reported for medicine to the packages presented in those same households in subsample]; homoeopathic treatments or other substances obtained from a healthcare provider (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013). The most common animal illness reported was poor general health and slow growth (Roess, 2006). Respondents sought treatment for this from household members more often than from other healthcare providers (350/469 versus 119/469, respectively) (Table 2), and additives were almost exclusively used for treatment (245/246) (Table 3). For diarrhoea and fever, respondents visited village doctors more than government doctors or drug sellers (Table 2), where the medicines that were purchased differed significantly according to who recommended the medicines. For instance, village doctors sold what they recommended in more than half of cases (73/135); household members recommended treatments that were most often obtained from pharmacies (331/388); and drug sellers sold what they recommended (30/33). In this context, drug sellers were generally in the informal sector and may or may not have formal training as pharmacists. They generally travelled with their products or had small stalls in a market. Pharmacies on the other hand were well stocked and generally run by pharmacists who had formal training. They were generally larger stalls in market places or small stand alone building.",

While some have estimated it to contribute more to the overall burden of drug resistance than human use of antibiotics; the attributable fraction of this practice on the burden of antibiotic resistance in clinically important pathogens to humans is unknown (Angulo et al., 2009; Marshall and Levy, 2011). The prevalence of antibiotic\u2010resistant pathogens has increased steadily in LMIC since the introduction of antibiotics (Radyowijati and Haak, 2003). Despite the recognized importance of examining both animal and human antibiotic use at the household level in a LMIC setting, no other studies have been published that report this information. We report frequent animal medicine use at the household level in rural Bangladesh (Sylhet district) and frequent treatment purchase from pharmacies which are indicative of non\u2010human antibiotic use. Respondents reported using medicines in almost a quarter of animal treatment events specifically for diarrhoea and fever more than other treatments, and medicines were recommended and obtained from trained healthcare providers and drug sellers. We conducted qualitative interviews with drug sellers and village doctors to triangulate the findings of this study, and we found that the terms that respondents used for medicines were used by drug sellers and village doctors for antimicrobials (most commonly referring to oxytetracycline and metronidazole). The reported use of medicines may be a proxy for antibiotic use, yet information on the extent of non\u2010human antibiotic use is lacking (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013). Additives were most often recommended by household members and were a common treatment. As described, additives referred to grain and commercial animal feed that included antimicrobials and were used primarily to treat animals that were in general poor health or were not growing (Roess, 2006). Living with a household member who was working on a poultry farm or another type of farm was associated with using animal medicines and additives. We previously reported that commercial poultry farms in Bangladesh use prepared animal feed and antibiotics and that poultry farm workers reported applying these techniques for their personal livestock holdings (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013).",

This is also the case for human treatment (Schorling et al., 1991; Dua et al., 1994; Calva and Bojalil, 1996). Other important animal healthcare providers that emerged in our studies included government veterinarians, livestock office doctors (poshudaktar) and \u2018locals who know about animals\u2019 (Roess, 2006). The lack of infrastructure was perceived by the household respondents and by the veterinarians interviewed as an obstacle to seeking adequate health care for themselves and their livestock when it is needed (Roess, 2006). Livestock are important culturally: in establishing the status of the farmer as providers of employment to the farmer and family members; as a store of wealth; and as a form of insurance (Riethmuller, Chai et al. 1999). Livestock provide an opportunity for low\u2010income farmers to accumulate capital, which in turn helps reduce hunger (Riethmuller, Chai et al. 1999; Peeling and Holden, 2004). The loss of an animal for a small farmer can have severe consequences, such as the loss of a source of income or social standing in the community. These are important justifications for spending a significant portion of household income on animal medicines, health care and other means of protecting livestock.",

Respondents reported that treatments obtained from a government source were on average almost twice as expensive as those obtained from pharmacies (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013). Although these treatments are officially free of charge, various factors may contribute to this. For example, because there is often a lack of paved roads and other infrastructure deficits, employees incur costs to reach their posts that they then pass on to their customers (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013).

Respondents provided local terms to describe the products used. To address this limitation and potential source of misclassification bias, we applied the results of our qualitative research to the development of the survey and to the interpretation of our results. In addition to the respondents' use of the same terms for medicines as the healthcare providers used for antibiotics, we found that villagers who reported using animal medicine presented medicine packages or pills that were for antibiotics (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013). The use of additives (39%) may be indicative of commercial animal feed that may contain antibiotics as previously described. In\u2010depth interviews with personnel of pharmaceutical distribution centres uncovered frequent animal pharmaceutical sales to drug sellers in rural markets during the study period, and more than 50% of animal products sold in any reporting period were antibiotics (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013). Rationale for animal antibiotic use in rural Bangladesh is similar to that of American farmers in the 1950s and 1960s when agricultural antibiotic use was beginning (McEwen and Fedorka\u2010Cray, 2002) \u2013 specifically respondents report that it is an effective way to protect herds of animals who lived in closed quarters from diseases and thus appears to be economically sound. Future studies should examine the prevalence and emergence of antibiotic\u2010resistant microbes in similar settings in the context of household\u2010level antibiotic use for humans and animals. Due to logistic constraints and the lack of financial resources, we were unable to do so. Nevertheless, the emergence of antibiotic\u2010resistant pathogens is quickly outweighing the perceived benefits of animal agricultural antimicrobial use. Several European countries and the European Commission banned avoparcin in animal feed, and this led to a decrease in human cases of vancomycin\u2010resistant enterococcus (Angulo et al., 2009); similar interventions may be useful in Bangladesh. Another limitation in our study is that it was nested in the comparison arm of an impact evaluation and participants had to meet the inclusion criteria which included the following: be married or divorced or widowed and have a baby <18 months old. It can be argued that families that do not have infants may behave differently with regard to the use of animal household products.",

Environmental health impacts of agricultural antibiotic use, including the observation of antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria of animal origin in areas surrounding livestock operations, could also be mitigated by such measures (Landers et al., 2012). Globalization and the documented epidemics during the study period, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah\u2010like virus and H5N1, are evidence for the need to strengthen surveillance of emerging diseases, including resistant strains in even remote areas of the world (Xing et al., 2010; Kerkhove, 2013). In May 2005, the World Health Organization passed an amendment mandating the reporting of seven diseases in member countries (Steiger, 2005). Although none of these reportable diseases include antibiotic resistance, this important step can be a platform on which surveillance programs can be built to monitor the emergence of resistance in the environment in remote areas. Information gathering of agricultural antibiotic use is necessary to inform treatment recommendations for people in affected areas. Improvement of government animal health services to strengthen outreach to the remote populations is needed to assist them to protect their livelihood, monitor animal health and prevent emergence of resistant bacteria in such populations.",
