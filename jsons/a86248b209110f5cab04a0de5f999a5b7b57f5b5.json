            "text": "Background Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the two most common bariatric operations. With the implementation of enhanced recovery protocols, the use of drains should decrease. Methods The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database was queried for the years 2015-2017. Our inclusion criteria included all patients undergoing a primary LRYGB, SG, and revisions. We examined demographics, operative characteristics, the use of drains, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and proportions. Student's T test (Wilcoxon sum rank test in the case of skewed data) and chi-squared analysis were used to assess the baseline differences in drain utilization. Results From 2015 to 2017, there were 388,239 bariatric cases performed without drains and 100,221 performed with drains. Twenty-nine percent of LRYGB patients had a drain placed but only 16.7% of SG patients. The percentage of LRYGB that had a drain dropped from 33.1 to 24.6% during the study period and that of SG dropped from 20.3 to 13.6%. Patients that had drains placed were more likely to have a provocative test at the time of surgery (prevalence ratio (PR) 2.24) and to have a postoperative swallow study (PR 1.93). Conclusions Drains are still commonly used in bariatric patients. Over the study period, there was a decrease in the use of drains in both bypass and sleeve patients. Patients with a drain were more likely to have had a provocative test and a swallow study and have a higher rate of complications and mortality.",

            "text": "Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses (LRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the two most common bariatric operations. The most far-reaching advance in bariatric surgery was the introduction of laparoscopic surgery, with widespread adoption by the mid-1990s [1, 2]. Wittgrove and Clark performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass in 1993, and by the turn of the century, bariatric surgery became almost exclusively performed using the laparoscopic technique [3] . This has led to decreased length of stay, rare utilization of intensive care units for the standard bariatric operation, and a progression towards enhanced recovery methods [4, 5] . With the implementation of enhanced recovery protocols, surgeons tend to use less invasive methods of perioperative management. This includes decrease in urinary catheterization and the use of nasogastric tubes and abdominal drains (referred to as drains hereafter). Despite the guidelines provided by the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons in 2009, there is still controversy about the routine use of drains and indications for drain placement [6] . As practice patterns change and enhanced recovery protocols are adopted, the use of drains should decrease.",

This database includes patients that underwent metabolic or bariatric surgery and reports 30-day outcomes. The Participant Use Data File (PUF) has been completed and made available for study for the years 2015-2017. The use of drains has been evaluated in the database by Doumouras et al. in their seminal article evaluating the PUF for the year 2015 [8] . They showed that the overall drainage rate was 24.4%. They looked at 5 major outcomes: leak, reoperation, morbidity, readmission, and mortality. They found that the use of a drain increased the odds of a leak by 30%. There was also an increase in reoperation, morbidity, and readmission, but there was no difference in mortality. They concluded that routine abdominal drainage should not be used because it Bincreased the rate of all-cause morbidity, reoperations, and anastomotic leaks....D espite this conclusion, we felt that abdominal drainage was not the cause of increased complications and proposed building on this work but including 3 years of MBSAQIP data. We wanted to see if we could find common preoperative characteristics that might have led to drains being placed, operative variables that were associated with drain placement, and differences in postoperative complications in those patients receiving drains. This can be summed up by two questions: what are the characteristics of patients that have drains placed, and what are the outcomes of those patients? Our secondary outcomes of interest were trends in drain utilization in bariatric surgery for the years 2015-2017.",

Once the drain was placed, those patients had a higher rate of swallow studies and longer length of stay. Complications were more likely in the drain group as was the risk of reoperation, readmission, and death. Drainage may reflect the surgeon's intraoperative evaluation of the difficulty of the case or the value assigned to the likelihood of a postoperative complication, but this cannot be proved with the MBSAQIP database. There is also no way to determine from the MBSAQIP database what kind of drain was used. This could range from a simple silastic drain to a closed suction drain. As a suction drain could theoretically cause a leak, this is potentially important information lacking in this dataset.",

            "text": "Dourmouras et al. wrote the first analysis of drain usage using the MBSAQIP database. We too found an increased relative risk of complications in patients that had abdominal drainage [8] . They used a regression analysis to look at the five outcomes of interest to come to this conclusion. There was an increased risk of having these outcomes in patients who underwent drainage in their study. As noted in the BIntroduction,^they felt that routine abdominal drainage was possibly harmful to the patient, and noted an increased risk of all-cause morbidity, reoperations, and anastomotic leaks. The MBSAQIP database does not have the ability to differentiate between statistical association and causality. A randomized controlled trial would be able to do this, but an Although patients in the ND group still had routine and selective swallow studies postoperatively, there was a PR of 1.9 and 1.8, respectively, for the WD group. WD patients also had a more than double rate of having a provocative leak test (PR = 2.24). While the MBSAQIP database does not provide the granularity to examine individual surgeon preferences, we feel it is a safe inference that those surgeons were worried enough to perform not only a provocative test at the time of the operation on patients they drained, but also to order a swallow study postoperative. Thus, it is reasonable based on these findings, to draw the opposite conclusion from the previous authors, namely that the drain is a Bsymptom^of a higher-risk patient, not a Bcause^of complications and increased morbidity. The MBSAQIP database was also studied by Alizadeh et al. regarding the risk factors for gastrointestinal leak after bariatric surgery. They used the 2015 PUF and looked at SG and GB patients. Among other risk factors, patients with a drain had a higher leak rate of 1.6% vs. 0.4% in patients with no drain [10] . They noted the association of leakage to drain placement and provocative testing with an adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) of 3.46 and 1.41, respectively. They felt the provocative testing could have been performed in an aggressive manner with a nasogastric tube, thereby causing the leak, and preferred using an endoscope. There is no way to tease this data out of the PUF, as the technique used is not specified. Alizadeh et al. felt the APR for leaks with drainage was likely a selection bias, which is supported by the current paper. So, what is the benefit of drainage? This data, and the referenced literature, do not show a clear benefit. Drains can be used to detect bleeding and also leaks. Some surgeons have advocated sending the drain fluid for amylase, which has been shown to be sensitive for a leak [11] . Others recommend having the patient drink methylene blue and assessing the drain output for any blue discoloration [12] . Postoperative hemorrhage can also be detected by intra-abdominal drainage [13] . Drains may facilitate early detection of leak or bleeding, leading to a shorter time for definitive surgical care. Bariatric surgeons must be ever vigilant to these complications and should not be distracted by the presence or absence of a drain and must be careful to evaluate the entire clinical picture. In cases of uncertainty and/or an unstable patient, prompt operative exploration is paramount.",

The database is non-randomized, so the comparison is retrospective between cohorts. Also, individual surgeon outcomes are not obtainable from this database, and there is no way to account for the variable results of different accredited centers. This is an especially glaring limitation regarding the questions of drains. We can infer that surgeons left drains in higher-risk patients, but there may be a sizeable percentage of surgeons who routinely leave drains. The strength of this study is the size of this database. It spans 2 countries and collects data on all accredited centers. The data collection process is validated and less subject to bias.
