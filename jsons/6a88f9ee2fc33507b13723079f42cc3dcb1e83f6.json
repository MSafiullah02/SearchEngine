The Structural Proteomics In Europe (SPINE) consortium (http://www.spineurope.org) is committed to working predominantly on high-value (in terms of impact on human health) viral and human targets despite the observation that many such proteins are notoriously intractable targets for expression in Escherichia coli. In prokaryotes, the lack of post-translation modification, limited disulfide-bond formation and the absence of various chaperones often hinder the generation of properly folded fully functional eukaryotic proteins. A variety of eukaryotic expression systems have been developed in response to such problems. Although expression in these eukaryotic systems is, in general, time-consuming and more expensive than expression in prokaryotic systems, many structural biologists studying viral and human proteins have found that they often provide the only route forward. This was recognized at the earliest planning stages of SPINE, with the acceptance that in order to successfully tackle targets from a broad range of protein families, high-throughput (HTP) methodologies for eukaryotic expression would be required.",

The challenge for SPINE was therefore twofold: ab initio development of robust HTP methodologies for eukaryotic expression in a subset of partner laboratories, followed by dissemination of these technologies to laboratories with little or no previous experience of such expression systems.",

Flanking recombination sequences (40 nucleotides each), which are homologous to the CUP1 promoter and to the terminator region of the yeast vector pYEXTHS-BN, respectively, were thus added to the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the expression cassette. The PCR products were co-transformed with the linearized expression vector pYEXTHS-BN in yeast and the expression cassette was integrated by homologous recombination. Correct integration was confirmed by analytical PCR and sequencing analysis. HTP expression screening and IMAC purification of the expressed fusion proteins was carried out in 96-well format. Two PCR-verified yeast clones of each cDNA insert were screened for protein expression. Clones were checked by Western blot analysis of their total cellular proteins by using the PentaHis antibody (Qiagen). Proteins were purified under native conditions from cleared cell lysates using the amino-terminally fused His 6 tag and the resulting eluates were assessed by using the C-terminal StrepII-tag to detect the proteins and to confirm the fulllength translation of the gene products.",

A key, and traditionally cumbersome, step is the generation of the recombinant baculovirus. The Reading group described genetic modification of the baculovirus genome to ensure 100% recombinant formation (Zhao et al., 2003) . In brief, the strategy uses a defective baculovirus genome that is rescued through recombination with a cotransfected plasmid containing the gene of interest. A commercialized version of this methodology has been implemented in the Oxford laboratory (see below). The Reading group also piloted a combined approach to E. coli and insect-research papers cell expression through the use of dual promoter vectors (Xu & Jones, 2004; Chambers et al., 2004) . This multi-promoter strategy was adopted in Oxford, where the pTriEX 2 vector was modified for In-Fusion cloning (see Table 1 ). Oxford also adapted the pBac2 (Novagen) baculovirus transfer vector to allow Gateway cloning. Similarly, Strasbourg developed a set of Gateway-based vectors (see Table 1 ) which, after recombination to create the baculovirus, encode N-terminal fusion(s) as well as a C-terminal His 6 tag in frame with the subcloned ORF. This design followed the same model as that used in Strasbourg for prokaryotic expression vectors (i.e. providing the possibility of inserting a new fusion encoding sequence using specific restriction sites located both upstream and downstream of the Gateway cassette; Busso et al., 2005; D. Busso, in preparation) .",

Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in lysis buffer and disrupted using a 24-probe sonication head, after which expression and solubility were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Since all the constructs harbour a His 6 tag (either N-or C-terminal), automated mini-purification screening can be used as for prokaryotic expressed proteins. Soluble factions are applied After extensive washing, bound proteins are analyzed on SDS-PAGE by adding directly loading buffer to the resin. SPINE laboratories typically reported protein expression in flasks to be a convenient and adequate means of production for most protein targets; for example, in Strasbourg scale-up (1-2 l cultures) used Bellco flasks (several of which could be used in parallel for different targets). However, where larger scale production was required (for targets which gave low expression but were of high scientific value) Oxford and Reading established large-scale (5-10 l) suspension cultures of insect cells using disposable bioreactors (Wave Biotech).",

The BaculoDirect approach also requires an initial Gateway cloning step, but the cost per reaction is substantially higher and there is less flexibility in terms of construct design (e.g. addition of different fusion tags). The Bac-to-Bac approach (Strasbourg) is less expensive but more complex since it involves an additional E. coli-based step and takes around one week before recombinant virus is obtained. Bacto-Bac provides a robust methodology for a semi-automated approach to baculovirus expression; however, it is somewhat slower than FlashBac and BaculoDirect, which also have the advantage that they can be readily automated, exemplified by Oxford/Brookes where cell seeding into 24-well plates, transfections, infections, viral dilutions and parallel expression screening have all been implemented on a simple liquid handling robot (King et al., manuscript in preparation).",

Two standard cell lines were used, Sf9 and TnHi5 (Invitrogen), and both were grown in SF900II media with SeMet added to give concentrations of either 100 or 500 mg l \u00c01 (see x2.2.2). For each of the four experiments the level of SeMet incorporation was assessed using polyhedra produced in the cells after wild-type baculovirus (AcMNPV) infection. AcMNPV polyhedrin, the protein which forms polyhedra in the infected insect cells, contains six methionine residues. The incorporation levels for Sf9 cells were 1.03 and 3.14 Se atoms per protein for 100 and 500 mg l \u00c01 SeMet concentrations, respectively. For High5 cells the selenium incorporation rates were 2.11 and 3.78 per protein for 100 and 500 mg l \u00c01 SeMet concentrations, respectively. These initial results show two clear trends. SeMet incorporation is higher in High5 cells than Sf9 and the higher the concentration of SeMet in the media the greater the level of incorporation achieved (the maximum in this set of experiments being 63%).",

Arrows indicate the predicted positions of the proteins. Lane 1, analysis of a 15 ml culture supernatant following 2 d induction; lane 2, proteins obtained upon elution from Ni-NTA agarose beads.

After 3 d, the protein was purified from the tissue-culture supernatant by metalchelation chromatography. HPLC-based analysis of the released 2AB-labelled glycans indicated that whereas the large and heterogeneous N-glycans from the 293T cell line consist of multiantennary complex N-glycans typical of most mammalian expression systems, mutation of the GnT1 gene yields a pattern dominated by the Man 5 GlcNAc 2 N-glycan. Moreover, virtually all the protein was sensitive to EndoH (Fig. 4) . EndoH-treated RPTP formed crystals that diffract beyond 3 \u00c5 , whereas native glycosylated protein produced in 293T cells diffracted to >6 \u00c5 (Aricescu et al., unpublished work) , an observation consistent with the Oxford group's previous experience with this strategy of deglycosylation. Because yields from these cells are reduced by the absence of the SV40 large T antigen, however, Oxford have examined the effects of additional processing inhibitors on 293T cells, have attempted to derive ethyl methanesulfonate-mutated GnT1 \u00c0/\u00c0 -deficient 293T cell lines (Chang et al., in preparation) and have established methods for deglycosylating proteins expressed in insect-cell-based expression systems (Chang et al., in preparation).",

A survey of the relative usage in structural biology worldwide of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems (based on Protein Data Bank depositions in 2004 and 2005) reveals that out of a total of nearly 7000 PDB entries deposited in the last 2 y, only 396 (less than 6%) record the use of an eukaryotic expression system. For these 396 entries the relative ratios for use of baculovirus, yeast and mammalian-based systems are approximately 3:2:1. These statistics are broadly representative of the level of eukaryotic expression system usage across most of the partner laboratories prior to the start of SPINE.",

Firstly, there are systems which are not considered promising candidates for use in HTP strategies. As noted above (x1 and x3.4) stable expression in mammalian (CHO) cells is a tried and tested route to protein production for structural studies (and has yielded a SPINE structure; Love et al., 2003) , but is not well suited to incorporation within a HTP-based strategy. Insect cells, like mammalian cells, can be used directly for stable expression of proteins. As part of SPINE, Stockholm tested a set of 25 human protein targets for stable expression in insect (S2) cells; however, the results were not encouraging since although $50% of the targets were expressed as soluble proteins the levels of expression were in all cases less than 2 mg per litre of culture medium and in most cases were less than 1 mg per litre (G. Schneider; unpublished results). Thus, this strategy has not been pursued further and has not been detailed in the previous sections.",

            "text": "Within SPINE, baculovirus-infected insect cells have remained the most frequently used eukaryotic system; however, mammalian cells appear poised to overtake yeast as the second most used system. Several of the partners have implemented eukaryotic expression as a standard route for production of proteins that fail to give soluble expression in HTP E. coli-based expression screening; to date, this has been predominantly for the expression of human rather than pathogen protein targets (see Banci et al., 2006; Fogg et al., 2006) . The success rates reported by SPINE laboratories for the soluble expression of human and viral target proteins in E. coli-based systems are 20-30% (see Alzari et al., 2006) ; in comparison, insect and mammalian cell expression systems have delivered success rates of 45 and 76%, respectively (see Banci et al., 2006) . Whilst these success rates for the eukaryotic expression systems are still based on a relatively small sample set of SPINE targets (which is biased in terms of certain protein families, e.g. kinases, nuclear receptors, secreted proteins), they have clearly provided valuable rescue routes for high-value SPINE targets. The results for yeastbased expression are complicated by the small number of specifically SPINE target constructs tested (18 in total reported by the Amsterdam, Munich and Weizmann laboratories); for this small sample the success rate, 22%, was similar to that for E. coli. However, one of the SPINE laboratories, Berlin, has run a significant number of human proteins though a yeast-based expression pipeline and reports a success rate of 58% for soluble expression (x.1.1), which is double that obtained in E. coli.",

Expression of RPTP in 293S/GnT1 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells leads to a larger fraction of the protein being 'nicked'.

In addition to work within SPINE laboratories, much progress has been made elsewhere in the development of the baculovirus system; the use of unified vectors and robotics (Albala et al., 2000) , transfection in suspension and deep-well culture of insect cells (Bahia et al., 2005; McCall et al., 2005) and streamlining the overall process of recombinant baculovirus isolation (Phillips et al., 2005) have all contributed to HTP baculovirus expression such that its systematic use, for example for herpesvirus open-reading-frame-encoded proteins, has been described (Gao et al., 2005) . Even the most streamlined system for expression screening in baculovirus takes approximately one week longer than a system based on transient expression in mammalian cells. Mammalian cellbased expression has, over the course of SPINE, emerged as a fast, robust and cost-effective method for efficient small-scale expression screening. For large-scale protein production comparative studies (Oxford) on the performance of baculovirus and mammalian cell-based expression systems are in agreement with the commonly held view that yields of cytosolic proteins are typically higher in the baculovirus system. However, for secreted proteins the converse is observed; transient mammalian expression significantly outperforms baculovirus-based insect-cell expression. Thus, mammalian cell-based expression strategies appear poised to complement insect cell based approaches for HTP protein expression.",
