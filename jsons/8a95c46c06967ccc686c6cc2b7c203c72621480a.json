The patient was treated with 8-cycles of induction chemotherapy, consisting of vincristine, carboplatin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide, as per the SIOP high-risk neuroblastoma protocol. Chemotherapy was administered at 10-day intervals with G-CSF prophylaxis. Induction was uneventful, with no episodes of febrile neutropenia. A re-evaluation bone marrow examination performed post-induction demonstrated a complete response. At this stage, tumor excision along with left nephrectomy was performed with resection of approximately 95% of the tumor. On histology, it was categorized as differentiating neuroblastoma. Postsurgery, patient was taken up for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). Myeloablation was performed with busulfan and melphalan with dose adjustment for weight (10 kg). Busulfan was administered orally with a cumulative dose of 480 mg/m 2 and melphalan (120 mg/m 2 ) was administered on day -1. Busulfan level monitoring was not performed due to non-availability. Prophylaxis for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) was ensured with ursodiol. The dose of CD-34+ cells infused was 4 \u00d7 10 6 / kg. The child had a relatively uneventful post-transplant period with fever and mild mucositis lasting for 2 days.",

It is clinically characterized by tender hepatomegaly, jaundice, weight gain and ascites. Strong clinical suspicion and an early recognition of clinical signs are essential to establish the diagnosis and institute effective regimen. Another complication of cytotoxic drugs given for cancers, is development of busulfan-induced lung injury. A strong index of suspicion is needed for its diagnosis, especially in setting where opportunistic fungal and viral infections manifest similarly. We illustrate the clinical and autopsy finings in a 2\u00bd-year-old boy who received autologous stem-cell transplantation following resection of stage IV neuroblastoma. He subsequently developed both hepatic veno-occlusive disease and busulfan-induced lung injury. The autopsy findings are remarkable for their rarity.",

There was single episode of fever on the day of admission (38.7 o C) with a subsequent afebrile period throughout the hospital stay. Progressive respiratory distress worsened into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ventilation strategy was modified accordingly. On day 63, there was development of hypotensive shock, initially responding to fluid boluses. On day 65, the shock necessitated inotropic support (dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline and pre-terminally, and vasopressin). There was development of left sided pneumothorax followed by cardiac arrest on the same day. The patient could be revived and pneumothorax was drained. Multi-organ dysfunction developed with acute kidney injury (onset day 63), requiring peritoneal dialysis. Significant transaminitis with elevated bilirubin levels was documented. Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenam on day 63; azithromycin was continued. Intravenous co-trimoxazole and gancyclovir were added in therapeutic, renal modified doses. Platelet concentrates were transfused to maintain a platelet count above 20 \u00d7 10 6 /mm 3 . There was development of refractory shock on day 67.

However, the child deteriorated despite administration of gancyclovir from day 2 onwards, which is unusual. Typically blood PCR is positive in such cases, though not mandatory for diagnosis of CMV pneumonia. Fungal infections are the next possibility, supported by the presence of candida in ETA on two occasions. Presence of normal neutrophil count and a normal serum Galactomannan are odd points. Galactomannan <0.5 has shown a good negative predictive value for Aspergillus infection [2] . Other viral infections that are important in post-SCT scenario include Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Para-Influenza virus, Influenza, Metapneumovirus, and Coronavirus. Multiorgan failure and lymphopenia is common in these patients. Patients with RSV often require ventilation. Associated co-infection with fungus, especially aspergillus can be seen. In the absence of investigations directed towards the myriad respiratory viruses, it is difficult to rule in or rule out these infections. Tuberculosis should be considered in an immunocompromised patient in an endemic country; however, the rapid onset of disease, absence of a contact and negative evaluation make it unlikely. In our case other bacterial infections typically seen in an immunocompromised child are also unlikely in view of sterile cultures, complete absence of fever and normal Creactive protein (CRP).Though this clinical presentation can be caused by infection with PCJ, it is an uncommon infection. Other atypical infections like Nocardia and Cryptococcus are rarer still. The non-infective etiologies causing respiratory symptoms in a post-transplant setting can be pulmonary GvHD, Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), Cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) and SOS. IPS is a very common disease in this situation, but is typically seen post allo-SCT and hepatitis is not an associated feature. On-going hepatic SOS is unlikely as there was no weight gain or tender hepatomegaly. GvHD and BOS are also typically diseases seen in allo-SCT setting. Pulmonary SOS is very rare and normal echo findings negate this possibility. The clinical presentation is consistent with COP, though it is more common in females undergoing allogenic transplant.",

The primary pathogenetic event is the endothelial injury of sinusoids and small hepatic veins. Following which, there is deposition of fibrin-related aggregates and oedema in the subendothelial zone [3] . Accumulation of these aggregates and entrapment of fluid and cellular debris progressively occlude the hepatic venous flow and leads to post-sinusoidal intrahepatic hypertension. This is accompanied by necrosis of perivenular hepatocytes. Histologically, acute, sub-acute and chronic forms of SOS have been described depending upon collagenization and fibrosis of terminal hepatic venule. Incidence of SOS varies from 0-70%, as it depends on the conditioning regimen used as well as upon the patient's risk factors [4] [5] [6] . SOS occurs more often after allo-than after auto-HSCT (8 v/s 3%, respectively), suggesting a role of immune reactions in this disorder [7] . Few independent studies have documented increase in circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a molecule released by the endothelial cells, in patients developing SOS [8, 9] . Increased PAI-1 levels might be of clinical utility in challenging clinical situations in patients with hyperbilirubinemia occurring after HSCT. It forms one of the therapeutic targets for defibrotide, which reduces circulating PAI-1 levels along with other actions. Other endothelial markers, like intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and thrombomodulin may also be helpful in early identification of patients at risk of SOS who may benefit from early introduction to therapies [10] . Diagnosis of SOS is based on constellation of signs and symptoms and serum bilirubin levels. Hepatic SOS is clinically characterized by jaundice caused mainly by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, tender hepatomegaly, fluid accumulation manifested as rapid weight gain and ascites [4] . Most commonly used diagnostic criteria for SOS includes the Seattle criteria [11] , the modified Seattle criteria [1] , and the Baltimore criteria [12] . Because of its high incidence and mortality, prophylaxis for hepatic SOS is widely practiced, using different regimens in different centres. When hepatic SOS is established, specific therapy is usually given in addition to general supportive care, especially in moderate or severe cases. Hepatic SOS is a formidable challenge both for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation and for their physicians.",
