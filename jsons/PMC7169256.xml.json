            "text": "A 14\u2010year\u2010old neutered Abyssinian\u2010mix female in\u2010 and outdoor cat was presented for dermatological examination of a progressive lesion on the left lateral muzzle. The cat had no health problems except for a 3 years\u2019 duration of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated since with 6 mg Atenolon (Tenormin Submite\u00ae, AstraZeneca, Zug, Switzerland) daily. A single episode of vomiting unrelated to the treatment was observed. Three months before referral the cat was presented to the referring veterinarian with an exudative lesion on the left latero\u2010rostral muzzle. There was no previous history of rhinotracheitis and/or conjunctivitis. As the lesion did not respond to either antibiotics or prednisolone, the referring veterinarian took a skin biopsy and submitted it to the dermatopathology service of the Institute of Animal Pathology (Vetsuisse Faculty University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland). Histologically, a diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma was made. Upon diagnosis, the cat, weighing 3.5 kg, was further treated with oral prednisolone, 5 mg day\u22121 for 6 weeks and with oral clindamycin (Antirobe\u00ae, Pfizer Animal Health, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), 25 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. The lesions did not show any response to therapy. Dermatophyte culture was negative. Two months after the biopsy, the cat developed a new lesion on the right nasal ala. The cat was then referred to the dermatology service. At presentation, the cat had two lesions. The lesion on the left side of the muzzle bordering on the nasal planum and lip margin was 1.5 \u00d7 3 cm, firm on palpation with thickening of the lip. The lesion was erythematous, alopecic, had a shiny appearance and had several erosions and small crusts. Some whiskers remained. A second small, ulcerated lesion with a thin crust was present on the right ala of the nose (Fig. 1). The lip margin itself and the oral cavity were not affected. Physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. Treatment with oral cephalexin 20 mg kg\u22121 twice daily for 3 weeks was started in order to reduce possible secondary bacterial infection to obtain a good quality biopsy. To limit a possible corticosteroid influence on histology, a recheck was scheduled after 3 weeks to biopsy the lesions. Clinical differential diagnoses consisted of feline herpes dermatitis, mosquito bite hypersensitivity, mast cell tumour, and dermatophytosis. At re\u2010evaluation of the histological sections of the skin biopsies taken by the referring veterinarian, intranuclear inclusion bodies were detected and a presumptive diagnosis of infection with FHV\u20101 was made. During the second visit a conjunctival swab was taken to confirm and assess the actual FHV\u20101 status of the cat by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Detection limits of PCR techniques vary widely and they do not discriminate between viable cultivable virions and immature, immunologically inactivated DNA.\n10\n For ethical reasons, the planned skin biopsies were not taken. PCR for detection of FHV\u20101 was performed at the Institute of Virology (Vetsuisse Faculty Z\u00fcrich, University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), following an established protocol for real time TaqMan PCR,\n11\n which confirmed the diagnosis of a FHV\u20101 infection. After obtaining the owner's consent and discussion with a representative of Virbac Switzerland, the following treatment schedule with recombinant interferon omega (rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9) (Virbagen omega\u00ae, Virbac SA, Carros, France) was started. Day 0: injection of 1.5 million units (MU) kg\u22121 of rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9, half of which was injected perilesionally and intradermally and the other half subcutaneously on the lateral thorax while the cat was sedated with propofol (Propofol\u00ae1% Fresenius, Fresenius AG, Bad Homburg, Germany), as needed (2\u20135 mg kg\u22121). The lesion on the nose regressed very rapidly, showing a clear improvement at day 2 already.",
