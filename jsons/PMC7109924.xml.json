For example, genome-wide association studies are enabling assaying of more than a million of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in thousands of individuals [6,7]. It is to be expected that understanding the functioning of disease-associated genetic variants and elucidating the underlying architecture of diseases will bridge the gap between scientific research and its ultimate application in clinical practice [8]. A decade-long effort to map human disease loci, followed by the positional cloning and genome-wide association studies has produced an impressive database of disease\u2013gene associations. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [9] database contains over 4500 phenotypes for which the molecular basis is known and describes almost 3000 genes with phenotype-causing mutations [10]. We are currently witnessing the shift from a \u2018single gene single disease\u2019 paradigm towards the \u2018interplay of different disease modules\u2019 [2,3] and ultimately to the notion of a \u2018personalized genome/diseasome\u2019 [11\u201313], but that shift is yet to gain momentum.",

The largest available molecular network for a human is that of PPIs. Network data on physical PPIs for many model organisms [14\u201320], humans [21,22], bacteria [23\u201325] and viruses [26\u201328] are obtained using high-throughput screens, such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays [14\u201317,21,22,29] and affinity purification with mass spectrometry (AP/MS) [18,19,30,31]. Since techniques for detecting physical interactions between proteins do not work well for membrane proteins, the new technology of membrane Y2H assays is becoming available [32\u201335]. Discovering membrane-interacting proteins is a key to understanding disease, since integral membrane-interacting proteins have a role in cell signalling and hence, their alterations can produce disorders rooted in disruption of signalling pathways. Membrane proteins account for one-third of the proteome. The difficulty in studying them lies in their hydrophobic nature, which makes conventional biochemical and genetic assays unusable. The above mentioned new technology allows for large-scale screening of membrane proteins\u2019 interactors in a range of organisms by utilizing the split-ubiquitin principle which overcomes this limitation. The effectiveness of this methodology was demonstrated by using the mammalian ErbB3 receptor as a bait to identify previously unknown ErbB3 interactors [32].",

The complexity of such a network is overwhelming, as humans have approximately 25 000 protein-coding genes and an unknown number of proteins due to many splicing variants [44] and post-translational modifications. Hence, the number of proteins that take part in the interactome is argued to be in the six-digit range [45]. The current state of art datasets are approximated to around 50 000 unique proteins that participate in close to 200 000 interactions [43]. When the quality score of measurements is taken into account, the human PPI dataset is pruned down to around 10 000 proteins participating in some 50 000\u201360 000 high-confidence interactions. This shows that currently available interactome data are still noisy and incomplete. Numerous biases are introduced by data collecting and data sampling techniques, as well as averaging-out the species population by using universal models of the genome and interactome [46\u201355]. Nevertheless, even such sparse data are often too large to be efficiently analysed by present day network analysis algorithms. This is due to their large sizes and the fact that many graph theoretic algorithms are computationally intractable (NP-hard or NP-complete) [56]. Hence, new approximate (also called heuristic) methods for analysing network data that can cope with the underlying complexities are being developed [57\u201360].",

It depends on the way in which the data will be analysed and thus must be tailored for the specific question that is to be answered. For instance, metabolism is a process which keeps the organism in homeostasis. The current representation of metabolism in literature is through metabolic pathways which describe smaller parts of the metabolic system that act upon molecules through a series of reactions. Thus, this description of metabolism can be hierarchically broken down into pathways and further into specific chemical reactions that comprise these pathways. The reactions themselves constitute processes that transform sets of chemical substances. However, modelling this system using a network can be done in a number of different ways, with substantially different outputs [61\u201374]. Consequently, this dimensionality reduction from the complex intertwined metabolic system down to a graph requires logically splitting up the entire metabolism into two categories: its basic elements and the relations between them, that is, it requires determining which parts of it will be described by nodes and which by edges.",

This is known as the \u2018metabolite-centric\u2019 mapping [66\u201369], and is the most common one in use for general-purpose extraction of knowledge about metabolism from these networks, as it closely mirrors the real-world structure of metabolic reactions. The second way is \u2018enzyme-centric\u2019 [70,71]: nodes represent enzymes, and a pair of nodes is connected by an edge if the corresponding enzymes catalyse at least one common reaction. This representation is used for understanding molecular wirings around enzymes. The third model, a reaction-centric map [72\u201374], is obtained by having nodes represent individual reactions and placing links between them if they are commonly catalysed by at least one enzyme, or if they act upon the same chemical compounds. However, even when we choose the nodes in the network representation of metabolism, it is still not clear how the edges between them should be drawn (details given in Figure 1).\n",

From this bipartite graph, two projections are made as follows: that of diseases, in which nodes are disorders and a pair of disorders is linked if they share at least one gene whose mutation is known to be involved in both disorders, and that of genes, where nodes are genes and a pair of genes is linked if they are both involved in at least one same disorder. When the former projection network is clustered, major disease classes are discovered, such as the cancer cluster, which is densely connected due to the fact that many genes are associated with multiple types of cancers [1]. Similarly, neurological disorders cluster together, but metabolic disorders do not, and are dispersed throughout the network [1]. Subsequent studies have shown that metabolic disorders are better modelled using adjacency via metabolic pathways, rather than via sharing of disease-related genes [75] (see below).",

Co-morbidity analysis of MDN showed a 1.8-fold co-morbidity increase in diseases linked in this network when compared to the ones that are not. A substantially different representation of metabolism, termed Network of Interacting Pathways (NIP), was used to show that the complexity of an organism\u2019s lifestyle determines how large, dense and efficiently organized its metabolism is, quantifying the changes in evolution of metabolism across archaea, bacteria and eukarya [75].

Recently, miRNA-based network reconstruction was implemented by Lu et al. [81], where they connected disease pairs whose associated genes are targeted by one or more shared miRNAs. A network constructed in such a way had clusters associated with diseases, such as cancer or cardiovascular diseases. Also, a negative correlation was found between tissue-specificity of a miRNA and the number of diseases associated with it. Another study has shedded additional light on the biological meaning of miRNA-based network reconstruction by strengthening the fact that a set of mRNA targets which are regulated by a single miRNA generally consist of functionally-associated molecules in human cells, rather than a random set of functionally-independent genes [82].",

Furthermore, clustering of nodes based solely on graphlet-based topology of human PPI networks was used to successfully predict RNAi targets as novel components of melanogenesis regulatory pathways that could not have been identified by other existing approaches [111]. Similarly, involvement of genes in cancer was successfully predicted and validated both through literature curation and experimentally, thus providing evidence that topological wiring around cancer genes differs from wiring around non-cancer genes [113].\n",

Several measures of topological centrality have been proposed, including degree centrality (i.e. hub nodes described above), betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, sub-graph centrality and graphlet centrality [114]. A general consensus is that topologically central proteins in PPI networks are involved in disease and aging. The concept of a dominating set (DS), that is, the set of nodes in a network such that all nodes are either in it or adjacent to it, has also been explored. Finding a DS of minimum size in a network is another computationally intractable problem, so heuristics are being sought. It was shown that proteins in a DS of the human PPI network constitute the \u2018spine\u2019 of the PPI network: this DS is statistically significantly enriched with disease, aging, and proteins participating in signalling pathways [114].",

Also, genetic interactions, that is, pairs of genes whose joint mutation produces a distinct phenotype, have been indicated as potential targets for therapeutic intervention [125]. A very small number of driver genes are currently known and it is believed that the complete set of driver genes is not very large [125]. Thus far, there does not exist a standard method for finding driver genes. Hence, a new method for analysing PPI network topology has been proposed aiming to give insight into network parts that are rich in driver genes [129]. This method, which effectively captures a large portion of known driver and other disease-related genes, is based on an iterative pruning of the human PPI network: it uses k-core decomposition, a method that first removes nodes of degree one (k = 1), then from the remaining network it removes nodes of degree at most two (k \u2264 2) etc., until it reaches the value of k where removing nodes would result in an empty graph [130\u2013133]. The largest value of k that leaves the graph in a non-empty state is called kmax. In this way, the part of the human PPI network that remains after kmax-core decomposition is obtained and examined for structural (i.e. topological) and functional uniqueness: this central, tightly-knit sub-network of the human PPI network is statistically significantly enriched with disease genes, driver genes and genetic interactions currently targeted by many drugs. Hence, it is termed \u2018The Core Diseasome\u2019 [129].",

Also, systems-level biological networks are currently only static representations of all interactions that we have ever observed under any condition and in any tissue, while cells are in fact dynamic, time- and condition-dependent systems. Hence, our data and methods should be extended to capture this systems-wide dynamics of biological processes [134\u2013139].

            "text": "Putting into the context of biological network data other approaches for analysing molecular causes of disease may to lead further insight. For example, it has been demonstrated that a significant number of diseases with early-life onset result from defective enzyme-coding genes, whereas adulthood onset diseases are caused by alterations in receptors and modifiers of protein function [140]. Also, it has been indicated that age-related diseases are a consequence of accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction over the life of an individual [141,142]. Mitochondria perform oxidative phosphorylation that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by utilizing energy released from oxidation of nutrients. In this process, toxic side-products, reactive oxygen species (ROS), are generated, which are molecules such as oxygen ions and peroxides. Increased ROS levels may lead to significant aberration of cell structure, specifically to DNA damage. Hence, many studies examine the role of energy and in particular, energy deficiency in human disease [141\u2013143]. A direct link between mitochondrial dysfunction and disease was established and it was shown that mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alone are sufficient to generate major clinical phenotypes [144]. In particular, mtDNA is present in thousands of copies in a cell and it mediates effects of the environment onto genes by accumulating somatic mutations in post-mitotic tissue and resulting in delayed-onset of age-related diseases [141]. Analysing these processes in the context of systems-level biological networks may yield further insight. Another way in which the disruption of one gene was shown to trigger the onset of a seemingly unrelated disease is through what is known as the neighbouring gene effect (NGE) [145], which is also termed the \u2018uncertainty principle of genetics\u2019 [146]; It posits that the deletion of a genomic locus may affect the function of one or more neighbouring loci [146], effectively disrupting events downstream of the unintentionally affected loci. Hence, NGE may lead to erroneous gene annotation: it is estimated that NGE erroneously affects the annotation of 10% of the human interactome [147]. Due to these effects, global changes in the currently available interaction maps may soon be necessary.",

However, it is not always the case that a reaction has transitive elements. If there are no transitive elements in this reaction, (b) the metabolite-centric network map would usually link A to both C and D, as well as B to both C and D, even though this might not be completely biologically accurate, since for the production of C (and D) both A and B are needed together, and this subtlety is lost in this type of network representation. However, the issue could be solved by using more involved mathematical concepts, such as hypergraphs instead of graphs, as edges in hypergraphs consist of any sub-sets of nodes and not just node pairs. By using hypergraphs (c), {A, B, C} and {A, B, D} would be hyperedges, which would better describe the real-world product\u2013substrate relationships. However, algorithms for analysing hypergraphs are far more mathematically and conceptually involved than those for graphs.",
