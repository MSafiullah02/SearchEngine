The discovery of these facts led to a change in the general concept of the role of H2O2, from a cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS; Box 1\n) variant to a signaling messenger. Since then, several studies have shown that the intracellular H2O2 can be generated via the stimulation of a variety of growth factors, cytokines and G-protein-coupled receptors 3, 4. Thus, it is now generally accepted that membrane receptor-dependent signaling is accompanied by transient and intracellular H2O2 production. Yet there is no quantitative measurement method that gives an accurate concentration of intracellular H2O2. It is therefore difficult to resolve whether the cell is being subjected to H2O2-dependent signaling or to oxidative stress (Box 1).Box 1Reactive oxygen speciesReactive oxygen species (ROS) are oxygen-derived reactive molecules. They include the superoxide anion (O2\u2212\u00b7), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH\u2022), singlet oxygen (O\u2022) and ozone (O3) in nature; in biological systems, the former three species are significant. The superoxide anion is not freely diffusible through the lipid membrane because of its negative charge, but probably can penetrate cells via anion channels. The superoxide anion attacks iron\u2013sulfur centers in respiratory chains and iron-responsive proteins. NADPH oxidases actively produce superoxide at the expense of NADPH in mammalian cells. H2O2 is both membrane permeable and relatively stable and oxidizes proteins, particularly methionine to methione sulfoxide or on highly reactive cysteine residues to cysteine sulfenic, sulfinic and sulfonic acids in sequence. Among the ROS, the hydroxyl radical is known to be the most reactive and toxic, and it rapidly attacks proteins, lipids and nucleic acids via a free radical chain reaction.",

            "text": "Mammals have a diverse set of peroxidases that collectively function to reduce H2O2 to water. There are three classes of peroxidases: catalase, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) and peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Catalase is a heme-containing H2O2 dismutase, exclusively localized in the peroxisome, a subcellular organelle devoted to oxidizing organic substances, and catalase is believed either to remove H2O2 that passively diffuses into the organelle or to prevent H2O2 leakage [5]. Five GPx isoforms are distinguishable by their tissue and subcellular distribution and substrate specificity 6, 7, 8. Among them, GPx1, also called cGPx, is the only cytosolic enzyme that reduces H2O2 by utilizing the electrons donated by NADPH via the glutathione\u2013glutathione reductase system. GPx1 is a selenoprotein that is produced at low levels and is dispensable in unstressed animals [6]. 2-Cys Prxs represent a new type of peroxidase, because they are coupled with thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, forming an electron-conveying system [9]. Thioredoxin reductase transfers electrons from NADPH to thioredoxin, which in turn reduces a disulfide linkage formed during the peroxidase reaction in 2-Cys Prxs. Thus far, five 2-Cys Prx isoforms have been recognized in mammals. On the basis of the peptide regions that harbor a conserved cysteine residue, they can be classified into typical and atypical 2-Cys Prxs (Figure 1\n) [10].",

            "text": "Distinct from catalase and glutathione peroxidase, the 2-Cys Prxs have several interesting molecular features. Firstly, their peroxidase activity relies exclusively on a cysteine residue in the N-terminal region. Secondly, they are fairly abundant proteins, present in an approximate range of 100 nanograms to a few micrograms per milligram of cellular protein [11]. Thirdly, they are distributed broadly in intracellular compartments: they are present in the cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum and, more importantly in the plasma membrane [10]. Fourthly, members of the 2-Cys Prx subgroup have a high degree of affinity for H2O2; that is, the H2O2 concentration to achieve half maximal activity is <20 \u03bcM in the presence of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase [11]. It is believed that the receptor stimulation triggers the generation of H2O2 intracellularly from the plasma membrane, so that H2O2 meets its target signaling molecules immediately. Indeed, non-phagocytic isoforms of NADPH oxidase that are integral membrane proteins with six transmembrane \u03b1 helices are implicated in PDGF-, angiotensin II- and insulin-dependent signaling [12]. For example, the PDGF receptor signals to NADPH oxidase via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Rac 13, 14. The direct interaction of Toll-like receptor 4 with the NADPH oxidase 4 isoform has been reported [15]. It is also believed that intracellular H2O2 generated in response to receptor stimulation is in the sub-lethal range, that is, several micromolar or less. In this context, the molecular features of 2-Cys Prxs implicate them as prime candidates for H2O2 signal regulators, although their catalytic efficiencies are less than those of catalase and GPxs [10].",

Similar studies have since followed using other ligands, such as thyrotropin (TSH), TNF-\u03b1, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), as well as further work on EGF-dependent H2O2 production, in various cell types 17, 18, 19, 20.

            "text": "Recently, systematic studies on the signaling role of 2-Cys Prxs have been published. One of these found the differential regulation of different MAP kinases by Prx II [21]. Under conditions of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation in which Prx II activity was either partially blocked using a dominant negative mutant version or was completely abolished by gene knockout, JNK and p38 MAP kinase activation was enhanced whereas the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) was suppressed. Given the fact that all three MAP kinases are activated by exogenously added H2O2\n[22], this is a surprising result in that, although it is structurally simple and reactive, endogenously produced H2O2 has a differential selectivity for different target signaling pathways. Another study demonstrated the regulation of PDGF signaling by Prx II [23]. It was asserted that the endogenous H2O2 regulated by Prx II targets the phosphorylation of the tyrosines at sites 579/581 and 857 in the PDGF receptor, but has no effect on any of the other tyrosine sites that are known to be phosphorylated (Figure 2\n), whereas exogenously added H2O2 was shown to induce the phosphorylation of all possible tyrosine sites. It was also shown that the site-selective response is controlled solely by Prx II and not by other peroxidases, and is achieved through the inactivation of the membrane-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Although these studies delineate the selective and specific roles of H2O2 as a second messenger and Prx II as a signal regulator in PDGF signaling, they are unsuccessful in elucidating the exact molecular identity of H2O2 targets. Further investigations are needed to determine a molecular link between endogenous H2O2 and its downstream signaling.",

By contrast, 2-Cys Prxs are irreversibly inactivated during the in vitro enzyme reaction in the presence of millimolar concentration of H2O2\n[11]. Whether or not this unusual biochemical property is meaningful in a cellular context has recently been addressed intensively by several laboratories. An acidic shift of the 2-Cys Prxs has been shown with the use of 2D gel analysis of H2O2-treated cell lines 26, 27, 28, 29. Mass spectrometric analysis of the shifted acidic spot indicated that the reduced active site cysteine in one 2-Cys Prx was overoxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid (-SO2). More importantly, this overoxidation was the cause of irreversible inactivation and was shown to require the complete peroxidase reaction cycle, such that 0.017% of active enzyme was overoxidized per reaction cycle [29]. The overoxidation is observed in cells challenged with oxidative stress or with long treatment with TNF-\u03b1 27, 29, but not in growth factor-treated cells [23].",

Although the chaperone activity of the overoxidized 2-Cys Prx in cells has yet to be proven, it seems to be crucial for the survival of oxidatively damaged cells. The reversal of the overoxidation is kinetically slow (the turnover number is 3\u00d710\u22123\n s\u22121) [35]; this makes sense, in that the chaperone function, if it exists, could this work throughout cell recovery.",

In normally growing cells, 2-Cys Prxs catalyze the peroxidase reaction through which the H2O2 signal induced by receptor stimulation is attenuated. When cells are damaged to an abnormal degree by exogenously added H2O2, however, 2-Cys Prxs become subjected to an overoxidation and multimerization, which in turn could endows them with a function as chaperones. Their role appears to be preventing protein aggregation and thereby assisting cellular recovery.

By contrast, a 2-Cys Prx appears to be recruited to the receptor in PDGF stimulation [23], suggesting that 2-Cys Prxs stay in the cytosol in resting cells.

Given that growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the generation of intracellular H2O2\n1, 2, it has been hypothesized that self-sufficiency in growth signals, one of the crucial factors for tumorigenesis [67], is accompanied by the ligand-independent amplification of H2O2 signal. In this context, Prx II has been surmised to be a fundamental intracellular regulator that determines the amplitude of intracellular H2O2 appropriate for hyperproliferation but insufficient for apoptosis. In support of this hypothesis, the suppression of Prx II expression using antisense cDNA has been demonstrated to render cancer cells more susceptible to radiation-induced apoptosis [68]. Prx III knockdown by RNA interference also appears to sensitize cervical cancer cells to death receptor- and stress-mediated apoptosis, possibly through the disruption of mitochondrial function [69]. Prx III has been reported to be a Myc target gene product [70]. Considering these data collectively, a plausible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer might be to screen for chemical drugs that target Prx II or Prx III activity, rather than targeting their transcriptional control. This approach could prove useful when applied in conjunction with radiation therapy.",

Therefore, it might be possible to design active site-directed chemical inhibitors specific to each 2-Cys Prx isoform.",

In addition, 2-Cys Prx inhibitors are postulated to be more useful than inhibitors of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase for controlling H2O2 signaling, because the latter enzymes have diverse cellular functions (e.g. they also couple with ribonucleotide reductase).",

In particular, it will be interesting to study 2-Cys Prx effects on insulin-receptor-, EGF-receptor- and vascular-endothelial growth-factor receptor-mediated signaling further, because these receptors are important in various human pathophysiological conditions. What is the bona fide target molecule of endogenous H2O2 in a particular signaling pathway? This will provide new insights into the mechanism by which 2-Cys Prxs regulate H2O2 signaling. And finally, what is the quantitative level of H2O2 that triggers the switch between signaling and stress? To answer this question, a novel probe for the quantitative measurement of intracellular H2O2 must be developed.",

Upon the engagement of PDGF (a), the PDGFRs form homodimers and phosphorylate one another (b). At the same time, H2O2 is thought to be produced transiently near the receptor. In this situation, a PTP in charge of dephosphorylation at tyrosine 579/581 and 857 is presumably located close to the receptor and is ready to react with phosphotyrosines at both sites. The generated H2O2 immediately oxidizes, however, and then inactivates the PTP. Phosphorylation at both sites is preserved, thereby activating the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The RTK actively propagates the phosphorylation signal to downstream molecules, which eventually induces cell proliferation. Because of the necessity for signal attenuation (c), Prx II is recruited by the activated receptor complex, eliminating H2O2. PTP is therefore activated and removes the phosphoryl groups from sites 579/581 and 857. RTK activity is consequently reduced, and the growth signal is diminished. In this model, the exact location of H2O2 generation and the presence of PTP responsible for dephosphorylating tyrosine 579/581 and 857 are tentative.",

Catalytic response: In normally growing cells, in which H2O2 generation is transient or pulsed, 2-Cys Prx efficiently controls H2O2 concentration through a canonical reaction cycle coupling with thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Stress response: Under oxidative stress, however, 2-Cys Prx initially undergoes a canonical reaction cycle but cannot avoid overoxidation to cysteine sulfinic acid (-SO2H), as a result of the persistent peroxidase reaction. The overoxidized 2-Cys Prx proteins then multimerize into a high molecular weight chaperone complex, which presumably protects the cells from protein aggregation. If the oxidative stress is weakened, the overoxidized 2-Cys Prx is gradually converted to active enzyme by sulfiredoxin in the presence of ATP. This model would be confirmed when it has been proved that 2-Cys Prx overoxidation does not occur during receptor-mediated signaling, which is a highly controversial issue.",
