Scott estimated the cost of HAIs to range from $28.4\u2013$33.8 billion after adjusting to 2007 dollars. Research has demonstrated that the cost associated with drug resistant strains is $27,000\u2013$127,000 higher than the cost of non-resistant strains.[5] Cost has been a particular concern for the healthcare industry because in 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began denying payments for HAIs.[6] The issue of HAI cost is complex and is influenced by many factors including the type of patient procedure and the type of infectious agent. A 2011 study by Umscheild et al. found the percentage of HAI that were preventable ranged from 45\u201369%.[7] This could result in up to 134,800 fewer infections, 3,100 fewer deaths, and a savings to the nation's healthcare system of $160\u2013$630 million annually.",

Two alternative strategies include room fumigation and ultraviolet C (UVC) surface disinfection.[10,11] Stronger liquid disinfectants, chemical room fumigation, and UVC germicidal irradiation are being deployed in healthcare facilities because of concerns about the role of the environment as a cause of HAIs and a perception that current surface cleaning and disinfection methods are ineffective. It is important to remember that germicidal chemical disinfectants have the potential to not only inactivate microbes but to harm patients and workers. A significant concern is that not only the employee using the chemical germicide but patients who may be in the room during or shortly after cleaning have the potential to be exposed. These patients may be more susceptible to harm due to immunocompromising illnesses and may have continuous exposures while they are hospitalized. It is also important to remember that exposure to ultraviolet radiation can damage the skin, eyes, and immune system.[12] It is also well established that all forms of ultraviolet radiation, including UVC can cause skin cancer.[13,14] On the positive side, UVC is the least likely of the UV bands to cause skin cancer because of relatively low penetration, permitting the radiation to be absorbed in the outer layer of dead skin cells.[15]",

Stewart and Hollenbeak found that C. difficile's contribution to costs and mortality have been overestimated due to reporting bias.[28] They found that previous researchers had not controlled for differences in types of hospitals, differences in patient populations, and the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes when estimating the total costs of C. difficile to healthcare systems.

Patients infected with MRSA and other communicable diseases will shed these microorganisms and may potentially serve as a source of HAIs.[33,37,39,45\u201348] Since C. difficile is a spore-former, it would be expected to be viable for months.[49] More importantly, the patient's environment has long been known as an important reservoir for C. difficile infections.[50] Even gowns and gloves worn to protect the healthcare worker have been found to be contaminated and to serve as potential vehicles of transmission.[51] A particular concern is that hospital textiles such as linens, surgical drapes, uniforms, patient apparel and many more may play a role in infection transmission.[52] There is evidence that the type of species or strain of microorganism affects survival in the environment. For example, A. baumannii strains survive desiccation better than other Acinetobacter sp.[45,53] In the case of C. difficile, there is evidence that the Type 027/NAP1 strain has mutated and now has greater toxin production, pathogenicity, and infectivity.[19,54] Akerlund et al. refer to this mutated organism as \u201chypervirulent.\u201d",

The actual mechanism of transfer of the infectious agent to the patient is not well understood. A large scale observational study attempted to identify the kinds of contacts between patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors that present a risk of HAI.[55] The researchers found that in 21.6% of interactions between patient and healthcare provider or a visitor, there was no contact with either the patient or the environment. The most frequent interaction was contact with the patient's environment only (33.5%), followed by contact with intact patient skin (27.1%). The interaction with the highest potential for infection transfer was contact with the patient's blood or body fluids (17.8%). A particular concern was the proper use of gloves while touching blood or body fluids. The study revealed that healthcare providers complied over 94% of the time, whereas only 33% of visitors complied. This is an important consideration because failure to comply with hand hygiene and gloving policy by visitors may significantly increase the potential for infection transmission.",

Black lights have been used to identify the presence of rodent infestations and in hand hygiene demonstrations (Glo Germ). This same approach has been recently applied by environmental services to assess the quality of surface disinfection.[56] UVC has been used for upper air disinfection in the control of tuberculosis or other respiratory diseases for over 100 years.[15] The most effective design involves upper-room placement of the germicidal lamps that are shielded to reduce human exposure. Another effective approach is to place the UVC lamps in the exhaust system ductwork, or they may be used in the disinfection of ventilation system cooling coils.[57\u201359] To be most effective, the design of the dilution exhaust ventilation should bring the airborne pathogens into close proximity to the UVC germicidal lamps. Chang and Young found that in situations where the UVC radiance is high, the air turbulence is high, and the air velocities are low, germicidal effectiveness is reduced.[60] They emphasized the importance of conducting tracer turbulence studies before considering the use of germicidal UVC to assure that the airborne microorganisms come into close proximity to the lamps.",

Some examples would include keyboard, patient bed rails, bedside tables, and even cell phones. Recently, there has been concern that mobile phones could serve as a reservoir for nosocomial infections.[66] Researchers found that 100% of healthcare workers' phones were contaminated with microbes due to poor disinfection and poor hand hygiene. A germicidal UVC wand could be an effective alternative to liquid disinfectants to disinfect these fomites. There are a number of challenges using this germicidal modality because, in general, microbes are easier to inactivate in the air than on surfaces. Unfortunately, current research has not considered some of the factors that limit UVC efficacy such as photoreactivation, relative humidity (RH), beam output stability, and beam angle in determining microbial kill rates.[67\u201370] Our research explores the effects of RH, beam output, and beam angle on UVC efficacy to determine appropriate uses and limitations of this technology.",

Our results support that high RH interferes with the ability of UV systems to successfully kill pathogens. There has been little research on the effects of low RH (<30%) on the efficacy of UVC irradiation.[72] We found that low RH also interferes with UVC's ability to kill S. epidermidis. The effects of RH on B. subtilis kill rates were less pronounced, and the primary factor affecting kill rates was the drying time of the test surfaces. When only a 10-min surface drying time was used, this significantly increased the ability of B. subtilis to survive the effects of UV disinfection. The 30-min drying time of test surfaces resulted in a significantly higher kill rate and was determined to present a more realistic measure of actual use conditions.",

At lower target distances (Figure 3), positions 1 and 3 only receive indirect beam exposure. At maximum distance of 50 cm, positions 1 and 3 receive direct beam exposure, providing a similar kill rate as position 2. The effects of distance on beam intensity and beam geometry are important considerations when using UVC as a surface germicidal agent. Placement of the UVC lamp at the minimum source to target distance will result in the highest intensity, but it will also treat the minimum surface area. Placement of the lamp at a longer target distance will increase the treatment area, but it may be necessary to increase the exposure time to maximize the kill rate. Our tests demonstrated that at a target distance of 12.7 cm, 10-sec exposure time resulted in the optimum kill rate (4.9-log reduction).",

Source to target distance and beam geometry were critical factors regarding radiation intensity and kill rates. Also, there is a tradeoff when considering the optimal source to target distance. A short target distance provides higher intensities and kill rates but treats a smaller surface area. Humidity had an effect on kill rates for S. epidermidis but not B. subtilis. For B. subtilis, surface dryness was a critical factor. Irradiating a damp surface treated with B. subtilis resulted in a significant reduction in kill rate. A limitation of this research was that we did not test photoreactivation. We cannot rule out that some of our results may have been affected by this phenomenon. A final concern is that exposure to UVC may result in ocular or dermal effects. Our results suggest that there is a potential for significant amounts of scatter radiation to the worker using the handheld UVC lamp. Therefore, it is essential that all individuals operating the device, take special care to avoid exposing themselves or exposing patients.
