Th17/Treg ratio could be positively correlated with APACHE II score, SOFA score, and Lung Injury Score, while there was a negative correlation with PaO2/FiO2 index. Moreover, ARDS patients with a Th17/Treg ratio >0.79 had higher 28-day mortality (P <0.001), with a sensibility of about 87,5% (better than APACHE II score and SOFA score alone). The authors concluded that Th17/Treg imbalance, favoring a Th17 shift, could represents a potential therapeutic target to alleviate lung injury and a novel risk indicator in patients with early ARDS [10]. In a murine model Q. Li et al. confirmed these findings, with also a correlation between IL17 BAL concentration and body weight loss; moreover, neutralization of IL17 by monoclonal antibodies significantly abrogated lung damage of ALI mice. In the same work, IL17 serological levels were also positively correlated with IL6 and VEGF levels in ARDS patients (n. 20 patients).

This procoagulative state is very often found in COVID-19 patient, that are at increased venous thromboembolism risk [14] . IL-6 and TGF-initiate Th17 cell differentiation by activating STAT3. Th17 cell population maintenance and expansion can also rely on IL-23 and on autocrine secretion of IL21 (via STAT3 activation) [16] .

STAT3 inhibitor fedratinib has an unfavourable side effects profile (including thrombocytopenia, that is already common in COVID-19 patients, neutropenia, ALT, AST, bilirubin elevation, and Wernicke's encephalopathy), and more drug interactions (interacts with CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors and with CYP2C19 inhibitors), compared with IL17 or IL17RA direct inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies) which could quickly stop the lung injury process from early stages, safely.",

On the other hand it would be of paramount interest to check how patients already on IL17 inhibitors treatment (for other clinical indications) react to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a recent retrospective multicenter observational study including 5,206 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis being treated in northern Italy (the area with the highest number of COVID-19 related deaths in the country) with biologic therapy and also with anti IL17 monoclonal antibodies, Gisondi et al reported no cases of deaths from COVID-related disease, 4 out of them required medical assistance in an hospital for COVID-related disease. The only patient treated with anti IL17 (secukinumab) did not required intensive care unit assistance, and was hospitalized for 12 days in internal medicine unit and fully recovered [21] . These results are not statistically significant, but indicate the urgent need for further studies.",
