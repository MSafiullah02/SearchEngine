Finally, we try to draw some lessons from this epochal experience, envisaging changes that could be potentially useful for improving the INHS performance, and hopefully that could be relevant to other European countries too.",

Local autonomy implies financial accountability, which allows regions to develop substantially different health strategies without national endorsement [3]; it is a common view among experts that Italy has 20 NHSs. Conversely, a national policy is not necessarily applied by all regions homogeneously. So, the central and regional tasks have been intertwined in the last few decades on account of many piecemeal legislative measures issued by the quite numerous governments over time.",

Altogether there are around 52,000 GPs fairly homogeneously distributed throughout the country\u2019s areas, ranging from 1.3/1000 inhabitants in the north-west area to 1.1/1000 in the islands [1]. As yet there is no national academic specialty in general practice in Italy, only 3-year postgraduate training courses that vary substantially in content by region [4]. Similar to the UK, GPs are self-employed physicians mainly paid on a capitation basis under national contracts, although additional financial incentives and fees for service can be agreed at a regional level. Unlike the majority of their British counterparts, many Italian GPs still work single-handedly, somewhat isolated within the INHS [4], despite several regional efforts to financially incentivize group practices since the late 1990s [5]. Patients are still registered with one GP, which is a major obstacle to them working in group practice. As a consequence, the weekly access to GP practices is limited. According to a survey we conducted 5 years ago on 731 GPs in three large northern regions [6], the average opening hours to the public were 3.5 per weekday, confirming the disappointing results of a previous survey conducted a decade before throughout the country [7]. So, the political slogan \u201c24-h access target\u201d of a recent reform\u2014drawn from the British experience\u2014proved unsurprisingly unrealistic [4]. Last but not least, since around half the Italian GPs are over 55 years old, an aging workforce is a further barrier to change in the culture of care.",

Around 80% of public hospitals have AEs [1], which generate a high rate of trust by Italian people and are perceived as the most appropriate place to attend for receiving reliable emergency care. However, overcrowding has increasingly become a major issue for the Italian AEs in the new millennium [9]. Because of the aforementioned weaknesses, GPs have great difficulty in playing their \u201cgate-keeping\u201d role in primary care, a crucial limitation in the aim of minimizing unjustified access to AEs for problems that could potentially be treated in the community. According to a recent INHS survey [10], more than 70% of the total access to public AEs was inappropriate, and empty AEs after the outbreak (for fear of contagion) may be considered indirect evidence of usual inappropriate use.",

Many efforts to make public hospital networks more rational have failed, eventually leading to questionable reorganizations at local level [11]. For instance, the two AEs in which the first and second outbreaks started in Lombardy are both located in very small hospitals. Lacking alternatives in primary care, a widespread (justified) sentiment in people living outside big cities is that increasing the distance to acute hospital services undermines easy access to healthcare, especially to emergency care [6]. This feature has traditionally fostered the political resistance to closing AEs in local hospitals despite their limited spectrum of clinical competences and technological equipment.",

According to the last European survey [18], the variation in number of ICU beds was really substantial between countries. Of the main Western countries, the lowest figures were recorded in Sweden and the UK, the highest in Austria and Germany. Since both the former countries also have a low density of total acute care beds, whereas the latter two have a high density [18], the idea that the number of ICU beds is tightly related to the domestic planning and funding of the other acute hospital services is strongly supported [19].",

            "text": "The first issue is institutional, which needs a political reform, since Italy can no longer afford to have 20 different regions. There are too many regions, which are too heterogeneous, with populations varying from an average-sized European country down to a modest-sized county. This makes it impossible for all of them to be equally organized for managing and providing the same kinds of health services. Moreover, the regional institutional autonomy makes the INHS too open to influence from local politics, undermining its technical governance [3]. In practice, regions can launch local policies without national endorsement. Besides working out a few but clear-cut \u201crules of the game\u201d at a central level to coordinate regional health authorities, the first bold and inevitable step to harmonize the INHS is to drastically reduce their number. For instance, assuming a minimum threshold of 5,000,000 inhabitants and taking account of the Italian geography, the number of regions could easily be halved or even reduced further \u2013 two each (West and East) for Northern, Central, and Southern Italy in addition to Lombardy (by far the most populated) and the two major islands (isolated by definition). Although politically challenging, this reform cannot be considered an insurmountable hurdle, especially after the catastrophic event we have just witnessed. For instance, Denmark achieved this kind of reform 13 years ago\u2014moving from 13 counties to five (new) regions\u2014despite tough political resistance [20]. The management of the Danish health service has benefited a lot from this reduction.",

Improving the consistency of non-hospital healthcare services at a local level is vital, starting from general practice. An initial rational step would be to merge all the existing sites providing different services in districts into single \u201chealth services\u201d open at least 12 h per week day [4]. These single facilities should bring together all the health professionals who work in primary care, GPs as well, who should become employees of the INHS like their colleagues in hospitals. Much easier to plan and supervise, these organizations would extend daily access to services in the community and appropriately filter minor ailments away from AEs in hospitals. A co-location of a wide range of health professionals in large-scale organizations open on a daily basis would also improve the provision of home services for elderly people who are unable to travel [6], besides facilitating their informal care-givers (e.g., relatives). Moreover, this would help people appreciate that the INHS does not consist only of hospitals, the hitherto easily identifiable health facilities that they often inappropriately attend as a consequence. It is not by chance that low levels of AE crowding are reported in countries with strong outpatient healthcare services, such as in the Scandinavian case [9]. Last but not least, this should help politicians close small and inefficient acute hospitals, as the above-mentioned Danish reforms have done successively [20], and as occurred with the closure of cottage hospitals many years ago in the UK.",

The outfit of ICUs in public hospitals is rather homogeneous throughout Italy and their average occupancy rate is acceptable during \u201cnormal\u201d times, so an increase of public beds could lead to long-term inefficiencies. Conversely, the sudden influx caused by a pandemic like COVID-19 quickly puts under strain any critical-care capacity. Therefore, the best strategy in such circumstances is an emergency national plan, which should allow prompt central intervention, and coordination of regions, and involve the national network of civil volunteers and the army for building up new ICU beds if necessary. Finally, it seems obvious to recommend assigning the management of pandemics to a special unit of a national health authority charged with ensuring national preparedness. This has not been the case for COVID-19.",
