Range cattle and sheep in arid environments, for example, may occupy sparse grassland regions of thousands of hectares and move freely over many kilometers in search of forage. In these situations, pest management strategies must be effective and sustainable with minimal human input or supervision. At the other extreme are intensive, confined animal operations that are growing in popularity, particularly in developed countries in western Europe, Australia, and North America. In these facilities, poultry, swine, cattle, and fur-bearers such as mink are held at high density. These confinement systems may exacerbate certain pest problems, such as muscoid flies, which develop in the accumulated manure, and facilitate the spread of some permanent ectoparasites such as lice or mites.",

These fundamentals of integrated pest management can be much more difficult to define in animal systems. Certain production parameters, such as losses in weight gains, reduced milk yield or quality, or losses in feed utilization efficiency due to pests, can be measured. They can then be related to expected economic benefits when considering the costs and benefits of control efforts. Animals also feel discomfort and are subject to humanitarian concerns for their welfare, which may affect pest control decisions. Further, many pests associated with livestock and poultry, for example manurebreeding house flies, are less important as direct pests of the animals than they are of people nearby. This may result in very significant pest control costs to producers, who are compelled by public health authorities to control the problem or cease operations. These humanitarian and public health concerns are very difficult to define economically.",

There have been few inoculative efforts in animal systems, but there is still potential for this approach as a part of integrated control programs. One example is the nematode parasite of house flies, Paraiotonchium muscadomesticae (Geden, 1997) , which has significant sublethal effects at lower infection levels and causes direct mortality at higher levels. Inoculative releases, as in classical biological control, may assist in suppressing pest levels below a nuisance or damage threshold. Certain pathogens are relatively easy to produce in fairly large quantities, but also are found naturally at low prevalence; for example, Beauveria bassiana. Other pathogens may not be found naturally in the area of interest, but can be very effective when applied, such as certain strains of Bacillus thuringiensis. In most cases, it is hoped that inoculative releases may result in establishment, or at least allow the pathogen to persist and be retransmitted within a target population. Pathogens used in augmentative or inundative programs most often are biological insecticides and are not expected to persist.",

In its indigenous regions, L. cuprina appears to have evolved as a species feeding on carrion during its larval stages. In Australia, where the many coprophagous species create intense competition for carrion, it has adapted to exploit live animals, mainly sheep, as a larval food source. Female L. cuprina lay their egg masses on the soiled or wet wool of live sheep. The neonate larvae migrate to the skin of the animal where they mass together and scrape the host's skin with their mouth hooks, creating a cutaneous myiasis, a suppurating abrasion on which they feed. Each myiasis frequently is created by several thousands of larvae and can extend over the entire back or flank of the sheep. Unless treated without delay, the sheep will die within a few days, apparently of a syndrome similar to toxic shock; the larvae do not invade into deep tissues until after the death of the host. These myiases are called \"flystrikes\" by sheep farmers. It has been estimated that L. cuprina flystrikes cause sheep deaths and losses of wool production in Australia valued at over A$ 280 million every year (Australian Wool Innovation, 2007) .",

The host's response to the severe irritation caused by lice is a reduction in wool production of up to 1 kg/sheep (Wilkinson, 1986) , which represents a loss to the farmer of ca A$ 8.00/sheep at time of writing. Equally serious is that the sheep will rub against any solid structure available, such as rocks, fences, and gate posts.

In 1986, control failures of some of these backline treatments were reported and resistance of sheep lice to the synthetic pyrethroids was confirmed. By 1990, resistance factors to the synthetic pyrethroids in lice from some flocks were as high as 26.1 (Johnson et al., 1990) and at time of writing, resistance factors very much higher have been recorded in lice from many commercial flocks throughout the Australian wool producing areas. Current control measures include the continued use of synthetic pyrethroids where sheep lice are still susceptible to these compounds, and the use of plunge or shower dips containing the chitin synthesis inhibitor diflubenzuron or a variety of organophosphate insecticides where synthetic pyrethroid resistance is prevalent.",

To provide the reader with examples of field trial scale and design, the Australian requirements for sheep blow fly and sheep lice product registration trials are described below. Sheep are mustered and inspected and animals with abnormal physical or fleece conditions are rejected. Sheep to be used in the trial should be as uniform as possible in age, frame size, wrinkle, fleece type and wool length. As a general rule, weaners or young wethers are preferred because these are most susceptible to flystrike and lice and so provide the most sensitive test of the control agent. If a mixed commercial flock of ewes and mature wethers is to be used, these should be assigned so that there is no sexual bias in any of the dose or treatment groups. With this proviso, the sheep are assigned randomly to the different dose or treatment groups. At this preliminary stage, it is a wise precaution to have larger numbers of sheep in the dose or treatment groups than will actually be used in the forthcoming field trial. This preserves the desired group size while allowing for any sheep which fail pretreatment inspection to be eliminated from the trial. The sheep in each dose or treatment group are then ear-tagged with plastic tags bearing an individual identification number for each animal. For ease of drafting after muster and throughout the trial, ear-tags of different colors may be used to indicate the different doses or treatments to be used.",

Sheep to be treated are mustered into a permanent or temporary sheepyard, from where a sheepdog works the sheep so that they move in single file through a drafting race. As each sheep passes the operator, it receives its backline treatment. This application method has the advantages of high rate of throughput of sheep and low labor input (one person and a dog). A possible disadvantage of the backline application method is that the control agent forms a concentration gradient from dorsal to ventral around the animal, which may result in only low or discriminating doses being achieved in the axils or on the ventral side of the animal.

Qualitative assessment of persistence often is based on the duration of efficacy of the microbial agent, and this has a direct and practical utility. The duration of efficacy also is an essential element in the validation of predictive dose models. Estimation of the duration of efficacy may be made by continual or repeated, natural challenge of the treated animals or substrate by the pests in the field. For example, the sheep may be exposed to gravid L. cuprina or to untreated sheep with heavy lice infestations. Alternatively, the treated animals may be artificially challenged at intervals by an implant technique using L. cuprina neonate larvae or by \"seeding\" the animals with a known number, usually 50, of young adult lice.",

The lice assessments are made using the 40 site scoring method described above. The house fly is thought to have originated in eastern or central Africa, but has readily spread around the globe with human movements and is now cosmopolitan. It is regarded as a synanthropic fly, since it develops in large numbers in organic materials accumulated near people (e.g., household garbage) or their livestock and poultry (West, 1950; Axtell and Arends, 1990) . House flies readily develop in manure, especially from confined swine and poultry. They also may develop readily in other types of animal dung, but on dairies and cattle feedlots usually are most abundant in decaying foodstuffs or straw/hay contaminated with manure and urine. House flies prefer moisture levels above 60% for larval development, and cease development at temperatures below 12 C (West, 1950; Stafford and Bay, 1987) . House flies disperse readily to nearby houses and are serious human nuisance pests, and most farmers will try to keep fly numbers in check for this reason. Proper manure management, particularly moisture control, is critical for both the house fly and stable fly. Many producers use insecticides for adult control (surface residual sprays, toxic baits). There is a growing awareness of the importance of biological control agents (predacious beetles and mites, parasitic wasps), and many producers now tend to avoid treating the larval habitat (accumulated manure) with broad-spectrum pesticides because of nontarget effects on beneficial arthropods. Economic losses from fly nuisance are difficult to quantify, but regulatory agencies may require significant and expensive control efforts such as intensive insecticide use or frequent manure removal. In extreme cases producers can be fined, sued or forced to cease operations. In addition to their direct nuisance potential, house flies defecate and regurgitate on surfaces they visit. These spots are unsightly. The behavior also contributes to the potential of flies to transmit or harbor pathogens such as trachoma (which may cause blindness), and particularly bacteria or viruses that cause enteric diseases of humans or animals (Greenberg, 1971) . Recently, concern for fly transmission of such pathogens has increased in accordance with development of antibiotic resistance and particularly virulent strains such as Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (Szalanski et al., 2004; Alam and Zurek, 2004) . Other flies can be common and problematic in manure, garbage, and similar organic habitats, particularly Fannia canicularis. These are similar enough to the house fly for many of the same management principles to apply.",

Parasitic wasps which attack the pupal stage of the house fly and stable fly (particularly species of Muscidifurax and Spalangia) are reared commercially and sold to producers for release. Results of experimental releases have been inconsistent but may be beneficial, especially in habitats such as semi-enclosed dairy calf pens, where parasitoid releases can be focused. There also has been interest in sticky stable fly traps, which may reduce stable flies locally, provided fly numbers are not too high. At the farm level, however, it is most common for producers to try to protect their animals using insecticides such as pyrethroids applied directly to the host.

In other cases only certain life stages are found on the host, but they remain there for substantial periods of time (days to weeks). This category includes adults of the horn fly and buffalo fly (Haematobia spp.) and to a lesser extent the face fly and bush fly (M. autumnalis and M. vetustissima). These flies spend much, but not all, of their adult life on the host, while immatures are found in dung.

An exception to this would be a pathogen capable of persisting on the hair or skin of a host or within a trap which utilizes host cues (e.g., kairomones) to attract and infect the target pest fairly quickly. Because the direct association between pest and host is of primary interest, monitoring often focuses on pests coming to the host or associated cues (e.g., CO 2 -baited traps), while monitoring of the microbial agent often requires sampling the immatures in developmental habitats.

The Entomophthora muscae species complex (E. muscae and E. schizophorae) have been observed to cause epizootics in muscoid flies for many years (Mullens, 1990) . Principal natural hosts include M. domestica and Fannia spp., and infection prevalence may exceed 70-80% during epizootics. A number of hosts may be infected by a given strain, although there is evidence for host specificity even within the Muscidae. More recently several attempts have been made to release infected flies and stimulate epizootics. These fungi can be maintained indefinitely in vivo in laboratory-reared M. domestica or grown (predominantly vegetatively) in tissue culture media such as Grace's medium. In the latter case, patent infections may be induced by injecting protoplasts into susceptible flies and then using cadaver-to-fly transmission to increase numbers of infected flies for release. While resting spores of E. muscae group fungi are reported in the literature, primary and secondary conidia are normally produced for expulsion from conidiophores; they are sticky, short-lived and almost impossible to handle or disseminate directly. Natural E. muscae epizootics typically occur when host populations are high and temperatures are not too hot (maximum temperatures below 26-28 C). Several researchers have managed to increase prevalence and stimulate earlier M. domestica epizootics on New York dairies through introduction of infected flies in two ways-deploying freshly killed cadavers with heads inserted into dishes of water agar in fly aggregation areas or release of laboratoryinfected flies Steinkraus et al., 1993) . The level of infection was not sufficient to exert control, however. Short-term establishment of E. schizophorae, which is not naturally found in house flies on southern California dairies, was achieved by releasing critically ill flies in a covered calf-rearing facility. The pathogen did not persist, possibly due to behavioral fever (Six and Mullens, 1996) . Enclosed habitats, such as poultry buildings, may offer more potential for control by E. muscae complex fungi (Kuramoto and Shimazu, 1997) . Flies probably cannot bask to induce behavioral fever and are in fairly close proximity to wild flies. Kalsbeek et al. (2001) , however, showed that house flies infected with E. schizophorae also exhibited behavioral fever indoors by resting on heat lamps provided for piglets in a swine barn.",

In general the effective concentrations of conidia in these tests have been high > 10 6 /cm 2 . The tendency of house flies to rest inside structures such as calf hutches at night makes an inside surface application of conidia an attractive prospect for control. Natural B. bassiana prevalence in flies is usually < 1%, but prevalence was increased to 43-47% on treated farms (Watson et al., 1996) . The fungi, in general, have incubation periods of several days to a week or more, theoretically allowing flies to reproduce before death. Kaufman et al. (2005) recently tested B. bassiana sprayed as a coarse fog (mostly residual application to surfaces) and releases of pteromalid pupal parasitoids against house flies in caged layer houses. The results were compared with applications of pyrethrin insecticides plus the parasitoids. Fly numbers post-treatment were reduced by the fungusparasitoid treatment. Renn et al. (1999) tested M. anisopliae against M. domestica in large enclosures 10 m 3 by using bait stations (sugar and muscalure) to attract/arrest flies and expose them to cultures of the fungus nearby. Flies did acquire many thousands of conidia, and almost all were killed in 10 days; the authors discussed how later fly-to-fly transmission could enhance the effectiveness of such an approach.",

Mated adult females in the larval habitat (in this case, cow dung) invade the host larva. They produce a parthenogenetic female generation whose progeny invade the ovaries of the adult host. Infected female flies then deposit gamogenetic nematodes, rather than eggs (parasitic castration). Recently a new member of the genus, P. muscadomesticae, was discovered infecting M. domestica in Brazil; the potential of this agent has yet to be assessed.

            "text": "Entomopathogenic nematodes in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis can be readily mass-produced and have been tested in the laboratory, where they can infect several Diptera of veterinary importance. Field trials have been variable. Early experiments generally indicated these nematodes were ineffective and did not live very long or disperse well in poultry manure, especially wet manure where M. domestica was common Renn, 1995) . Somewhat drier poultry manure (< 60% moisture) appears to be more hospitable for the nematodes, particularly if they are encapsulated in alginate (Renn, 1995) . Alginate encapsulation resulted in little infection and death of adult flies feeding on the capsules, but promising laboratory results were achieved when adult flies were exposed to nematode bait pads (Renn, 1994) . This raised the potential of a bait formulation. The encapsulation may serve not only to protect the nematodes from desiccation, but from ammonia and similar chemicals in a hostile habitat such as poultry manure. Other types of animal manure also generally are not as nitrogen-rich as that of poultry, and the entomopathogenic nematodes may have better prospects there. If used in a bait station type approach, the porosity of substrate can have substantial effects on how well flies may be infected by such nematodes; cotton poplin was good, while Perlite was poor, for example (Renn and Wright, 2000) . Renn (1998) demonstrated suppression of house fly in swine barns (farrowing) using S. feltiae or H. megidis incorporated into baits, or manure applications of S. feltiae (encapsulated or not). Control was comparable with, or better than, methomyl bait. The larvicidal application was targeted to drier areas of the manure, and it is possible that the nematodes persisted well there and attacked larvae preparing to pupate in these drier areas. Taylor et al. (1998) screened a number of species and strains of Steinernema and Heterorhabditis for infectivity against larvae of M. domestica in bovine manure in the laboratory, and nematodes significantly reduced emergence of flies added to this substrate. Some nematodes remained infective in cattle manure (detected by Galleria sentinels) for up to 10 weeks after application. Nematodes similarly have been utilized against lesser mealworm beetles. Geden et al. (1987) applied 900,000 S. feltiae in 8 liters of water per 8 4 m 2 areas of floor soil (using a watering can) in broiler and turkey houses in North Carolina, USA. The target was particularly lesser mealworm pupae that might persist in soil between poultry flocks. Treated houses experienced slower and lower level increases in beetle populations after new flock introduction, but numbers were about equal after 10-13 weeks. They found evidence that nematodes could persist at least 7 weeks after application in the field, and one container bioassay showed persistence out to 6 months.",

            "text": "The following section refers primarily to filth flies such as M. domestica, S. calcitrans, or Fannia spp. The egg stage typically is short-lived, and it is assumed the primary target for control is the larvae or perhaps the pupae. Plot selection varies with the distribution of the target pest. In moist to wet substrates, the eggs of most flies hatch quickly (< 2 days), the larvae spend several days to a couple weeks maturing, and larvae move to a drier area nearby to pupate. Pupae emerge after several days to a week or two. In confined animal systems, muscoid fly development occurs commonly at edges. The center of a feedlot, for example, is heavily disturbed by animal hooves, and flies cannot survive in numbers there. Rather, they are concentrated in relatively undisturbed manure under fencelines, or along feed bunks or water troughs. Even in undisturbed organic waste habitats, such as silo leakage or mounded manure stacks, flies are usually most common near the edges or near the surface. This may be due to fermentation heat or anoxia deeper in the manure mass. In certain situations, such as rows or areas of undisturbed manure accumulating beneath confined poultry in cages or dairy calves or swine on wooden slat floors, fly development can be extensive and relatively uniform, provided the moisture is consistently high (e.g., 65-70%). Even here, however, it is much more common for immatures to be highly aggregated. Typically, moisture variation etc. results in areas where flies are concentrated, and these areas constitute a small proportion of total available habitat. Given limited time and resources, it thus is necessary to find the areas where flies are most abundant and focus attention on them. If time and resources permit, preliminary sampling should be done in a statistically sound way, and numbers of samples required can be adjusted according to the degree of fly aggregation and level of resolution desired (e.g., Stafford and Bay, 1994) .",

For flies which frequent animals regularly, such as the horn fly Haematobia irritans or the stable fly S. calcitrans, counts on animals are frequently used. Exact estimates are very difficult, and quick visual estimates are more often used. With practice and comparison with more exact counts (e.g., comparing one's estimate with a count from an enlarged photo taken at the same time), fairly accurate estimates are possible. Often only one side of an animal is counted, and this number used in a relative way to assess control (e.g. before vs. after treatment). Binoculars are an aid under field conditions with pastured or range animals. Visual counts are somewhat subjective and thus, it is important to have the same individual do the counts over time if at all possible.

In either case, numbers should be counted at the same time of day, in the same location and by the same researcher. 4. Baited traps, using attractant materials such as the house fly pheromone, z-9-tricosene (Muscalure), with a toxicant also are useful in some settings. Such traps attract and kill flies which can be counted regularly (e.g., weekly). A convenient trap can be fashioned from a 3.8 liter plastic milk jug (size is not critical, but such jugs are common in the USA). From 3 to 4 entrance holes 4-5 cm in diameter can be cut out in the top 1/3 of the jug and a small amount of toxic fly bait sprinkled in the bottom. Flies enter, feed on the bait and die there, where they can be counted later. Such traps are best used under cover (e.g., hung from roof rafters) and care must be taken to keep animals and people from consuming the toxic bait accidentally. 5. Sweep net samples sometimes also are used to estimate relative fly numbers. If this is done, sweeps should be made in the same location for a set length of time or number of sweeps and at the same time of day to minimize the influence of fluctuating diurnal temperatures on fly activity.",

            "text": "Reducing adult fly numbers is usually the goal of control efforts, even though it is likely that application of a microbial agent might be directed at the immatures. The mobility of adult flies provides another major source of experimental error; adult flies taken in one area did not necessarily come from there. Further, it is dangerous to assume that fly numbers will be comparable even in enclosed poultry or swine houses of the same design and managed on the same schedule. Unanticipated factors may result in certain houses producing far higher numbers of adult flies than others. For these reasons it is desirable to sample the developmental substrate directly if possible, to attribute changes in numbers to a microbial treatment. This is particularly true if one is able to recover the microbial agent, or at least link it to dead hosts (e.g., dissecting fly larvae to determine presence of nematodes). Such samples, coupled with adult sampling, allow one to attribute control unequivocally to the treatment. It is assumed that sampling adult flies would most likely be in conjunction with discrete confined animal housing such as swine or poultry. Keep in mind that the treatment unit here is the house; replicate houses may be quite limited, and it therefore is quite critical that good pretreatment assessment be done. Sampling adult flies in conjunction with a microbial treatment might proceed as follows.",

            "text": "1. Determine by observation where the adult flies rest, and where they are most active in daylight hours. Placement of sticky fly tapes may help determine the species composition and distribution. If the target is a single dominant species such as M. domestica, spot cards (white index cards) are useful. Place at least 4-6 of these in each house; the ends of the houses often have larger numbers of adult flies. It is good to have some sampling tool to establish whether the fly species composition shifts over the course of the study. Sticky fly tapes placed near the spot cards, placed and changed on the same schedule, are useful. 2. If the pathogen affects adults (e.g., many fungi), a sweep net can be used to capture a sample of at least 100 flies (pooled from different regions of the house) to hold for determining pretreatment pathogen prevalence (e.g., Six and Mullens, 1996) . Establish baseline levels of fly activity (pretreatment sampling) over several days to a week. 3. If possible, pair the treatment and control houses according to the fly activity. Take the 2 houses with the highest numbers of flies, and randomly assign one to the treatment and the other to control. Repeat with the next pair of houses, etc. 4. Apply the microbial agent. 5. Take post-treatment samples at intervals similar to those used for the substrate sampling discussed above. Again, if the pathogen affects adults, a net sample of flies can be held or dissected to determine pathogen prevalence directly. If one expects activity of the pathogen might extend beyond 2 weeks (e.g., retransmission from initially infected flies or excellent persistence of the agent), sampling longer may well be warranted. If at all possible, one should not depend only on estimated numbers of flies to assess efficacy, since fly numbers can easily fluctuate for reasons unconnected to the treatment. While reduced fly numbers are of course the goal, cause and effect is more convincing if there is direct evidence of fly mortality caused by the pathogen in question.",

            "text": "Entomopathogenic nematodes can be mixed and prepared for application as a fly larvicide or against beetles to manure or organic substrates using standard techniques (Kaya and Stock, 1997) . Some work against M. domestica in wet, high nitrogen poultry manure habitats suggests nematode survival and infectivity for fly larvae are very poor (e.g., Georgis et al., 1987) , but some subsequent work in other manure substrates is more promising (Taylor et al., 1998) . As discussed by Renn (1998) , targeting drier portions of the manure (< 60% moisture), where flies may move for pupation, may be a more effective strategy than trying to kill larvae directly in wetter manure. As a larvicidal application, this study had better efficacy using a direct nematode spray to swine manure compared with nematodes applied in calcium alginate capsules. However, the encapsulated nematodes also can be deployed in a bait station against adult flies. There is some laboratory (Renn, 1994) and field (Renn, 1998 ) evidence that such baits (design not yet published) can control flies in intensive swine units (or probably similar settings). Many confined animal facilities, especially poultry operations, are very dusty. This might be a serious problem in using a bait (e.g., entomopathogenic nematodes) that must be delivered damp or wet. Based on available literature it is difficult to recommend a specific nematode rate for larvicidal purposes. Much probably depends on the nematode strain selected and habitat characteristics. High application rates of 8-9 million/m 2 were insufficient to compensate for low infectivity on wet poultry manure , and such levels are economically prohibitive in most cases. Renn (1998) applied 0.5 million nematodes/sow stall (probably at least 2 m 2 of manure substrate below the pigs) twice weekly with results comparable to fly control using methomyl baits. Based on laboratory trials, Taylor et al. (1998) suggest that moderate numbers of Steinernema spp. also might be sufficient for fly control on bovine manure, but field trials remain to be done. Trials of nematodes against A. diaperinus have shown infectivity when applied to soil where beetles pupated, but control has been short-term (see Geden and Axtell, 1988) .",

In selected cases, it might be possible to achieve some degree of control of a localized fly population with such an application. For example, one might spray adult flies in their overnight resting areas under the roof or eaves of confined animal houses and hope to hit a significant proportion of them directly. Indeed, the tendency of flies to rest in stereotypical areas on a farm provides some reasonable hope of placing them in proximity with a pathogen that can infect on contact.
