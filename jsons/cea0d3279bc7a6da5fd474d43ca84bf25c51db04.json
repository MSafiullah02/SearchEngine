However, the problem of COVID-19 is that around 70-80% of patients do not have productive cough. 1 To protect healthcare workers during sampling for diagnosis, the US CDC recommends not inducing cough to collect sputum samples, but rather the collection of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate. Nasal swabs are reported to have higher viral titers than throat swabs; 2 accordingly, nasopharyngeal swabs are the preferred samples in Japan. However, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs cause discomfort to patients and can potentially increase the risk of direct exposure of healthcare workers by provoking coughing. Moreover, the sensitivity for virus detection is low with these swabs; viral load is reportedly higher in sputum samples. 3 Here we report a case in which gargle lavage samples yielded a positive PCR result.",

Four days prior to his fever, he had had contact with a COVID-19 infection cluster. On admission, his vital signs were within the normal range and his breathing sounds were normal. His blood tests on admission (Day 6) revealed mild lymphocytopenia (720/\u03bcL) and slightly elevated C-reactive protein (0.88 mg/dL). Although his chest X-ray was not remarkable, his CT-scan revealed patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly in left lower lobe (Supplement Figure 1, 2) . Samples were taken to test for COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction, using primers from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 4 Oropharyngeal swabs and gargle lavage (using 10 mL of normal saline) were collected because he did not produce sputum. Additional gargle lavage samples and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested on Days 8 and 9 and found to be positive, with a slightly higher amount of viral genome in the gargle lavage sample (Supplement Figure 3) . His PCR became negative on Day 16 and 19, and discharged on Day 19.",
