In 2011, a novel member of the 39 Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of 40 diseased swine. Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among 41 livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure 42 to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the 43 viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of 44 humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny 45 virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of 46 IDV revealed many similarities to the human-associated Influenza C virus, including the cell 47 tropism preference for ciliated cells. Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-48 directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.",

            "text": "After the initial discovery of Influenza D virus (IDV) in 2011, among swine with like symptoms, knowledge about this new genus in the family of Orthomyxoviridae is 53 increasing (1, 2). Epidemiological studies have shown that the virus has a worldwide 54 distribution, whereby at least two distinct genetic lineages are cocirculating and reassorting 55 (3-10). Because of the high seroprevalence, cattle is the proposed natural reservoir of IDV, in 56 which IDV causes mild respiratory disease symptoms (11). In addition to cattle, IDV-specific 57 antibodies have been detected in swine, feral swine, equine, ovine, caprine and camelid 58 species, suggesting a broad host tropism for IDV (3, 4, 9, 12, 13) . However, the most striking 59 observation is the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational 60 exposure to livestock (14) . 61 There are several indicators that IDV has a zoonotic potential. For instance, the 62 utilization of the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a receptor determinant, that allows 63 the hemaglutinin esterase fusion (HEF) glycoprotein of IDV to bind the luminal surface of the 64 human respiratory epithelium (1). Interestingly, the utilization of this receptor is also 65 described for the closely related, human associated Influenza C virus (ICV) (15, 16) . 66 Furthermore, the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational 67 exposure to livestock and the molecular detection of IDV in a nasopharyngeal wash of a field 68 worker with close contact to livestock indicates that cross species transmission occurs (14, 69 17). However, thus far, there is no indication of wide spread prevalence among the general 70 population although the virus has been detected during molecular surveillance of aerosols 71 collected at an international airport (18, 19) . Therefore, it remains unclear whether IDV can 72 indeed infect cells within the human respiratory tract and thus whether it has a zoonotic 73 potential. 74 The respiratory epithelium is the main entry port for respiratory pathogens and is 75 therefore and important first barrier for intruding viruses. For more than 15 years, the human 76 well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (hAECs) culture model has been applied as an in 77 vitro surrogate model of the in vivo respiratory epithelium to investigate a wide range of 78 emerging and zoonotic respiratory viruses on their capability of direct transmission to humans 79 (20-24). The aim of this study is to investigate the transmission capability of IDV to humans 80 by inoculating hAEC cultures with the ruminant-associated IDV. In addition, we sequentially 81 passaged IDV further on na\u00efve hAEC to determine whether infectious progeny virus is 82 produced. This revealed that IDV is able to efficiently replicate in hAEC cultures and can be 83 subsequently passaged. Moreover, due to the similarity of IDV with the human associated 84 IDV, we compared their viral kinetics and cell tropism. This showed that both viruses have 85 similar replication kinetics and share a cell tropism preference towards ciliated cells. These 86 results emphasize that there is no fundamental restriction of IDV replication within the human 87 respiratory epithelium. Therefore, these findings might explain why IDV-specific antibodies 88 can be detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock.",

However, commercial antibodies against IDV are currently 110 unavailable, so we ordered a custom generated antibody directed against the nucleoprotein pattern, but some of those also appeared to have a nuclear staining pattern. To analyse if IDV progeny virus is able to infect na\u00efve hAECs of a new donor, we 121 sequentially passaged a 10-fold dilution of the previous obtained 72 hpi apical wash from our 122 three donors on a na\u00efve donor (P2). That was further subpassaged at 48 hpi upon hAEC 123 cultures of the same donor (P3). Like before, we performed the experiment at both 33\u00b0C and 124 37\u00b0C to assess whether there are temperature dependent effects. We monitored the production 125 of viral progeny at 48 and 96 hpi for each of the sub-passaging experiment. In the first 126 passage, viral RNA was detected at 48 hpi and increased with one order of magnitude at 96 127 hpi ( Figure 1I ). However, we observed that the viral yield at 37\u00b0C was approximately one 128 order lower in the first round compared to the viral yield at 33\u00b0C, while at 96 hpi this 129 difference slightly reduced. Interestingly, no difference between the different incubation 130 temperatures was observed in the second passaging experiment ( Figure 1J ). Also, no 131 pronounced differences were observed in the viral titres between the different temperatures or 132 passage numbers at 96 hpi ( Figure 1J ). However, at 48 hpi, we only detect infectious virus in 133 the apical wash from the last passaging experiment that was performed at 37\u00b0C (P3; Figure   134 1J). These results show that the viral progeny from the initial experiments on hAEC cultures 135 is infectious and that IDV can be sequentially passaged on hAEC cultures from different 136 donors at both 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C.",

The viral replication kinetics were monitored as before, by collecting apical washes 143 every 24 hours for a duration of 72 hours. We observed similar replication kinetics for both 144 viruses, although the viral RNA yield for ICV was higher compared to IDV (Figure 2A and 145 B). The replication kinetics of the IDV-infected hAEC cultures were similar compared to the 146 previous experiment at 33\u00b0C ( Figure 1A ).

We 155 used our IDV-NP-antibody for detection of IDV infected cells, whereas for ICV we used the 156 commercially available pooled human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). We used the 157 IVIg since most people have encountered one or multiple ICV infections during their life (28, 158 29). By overlaying the different cellular marker stains with that of the virus antigen, we 159 observed that for both ICV and IDV the virus-antigen signal overlaps with that of the ciliated 160 cell marker ( Figure 2C and 2D) . 161 To accurately define the cell tropism, we counted all cell types among ten random with our initial observation and shows that both IDV and ICV have a predominant preference 168 for ciliated cells. In addition to the cellular tropism, we also calculated the overall infection 169 rate for IDV and ICV, which is 4.1 and 3.3 percent, respectively (Supplementary table 1) . 170 These infection rates are in accordance with the previous observed replication kinetics 171 (Figure 2A and B) . 172 Collectively, our results demonstrate that IDV and ICV have similar kinetics in hAEC 173 cultures and share a cell tropism preference towards ciliated cells. Most importantly, these 174 results show that there is no intrinsic impairment of IDV propagation within the human 175 respiratory epithelium.",

Because cattle are proposed as the main reservoir, we first selected 202 to use only the prototypic D/Bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 strain, and therefore at that time did 203 not include the prototypic D/Swine/Oklamhoma/1334/2011 strain as a representative of the 204 other lineage. However, due to strict national import regulations for animal pathogens, we 205 currently cannot assess whether both circulating lineages of IDV exhibit similar 206 characteristics in human respiratory epithelium. Although, it is worth mentioning that IDV 207 has been detected in a nasopharyngeal wash of a field worker with close contact to swine(17).208 Suggesting that both lineages might exhibit similar characteristics in the human airway 209 epithelium. 210 Both IDV and ICV utilize the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as their receptor 211 determinant for host cell entry (15, 27). We have shown that both viruses have a predominant 212 affinity towards ciliated cells, suggesting that the distribution of this type of sialic acid is 213 limited to ciliated cells within our in vitro model. This tropism is similar to what we 214 previously observed for the human Coronavirus OC43, from which it has been reported to 215 also utilize the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as receptor determinant (36, 37). 216 Nonetheless, whether this cell tropism for both IDV and ICV corresponds to that of the in vivo 217 airway epithelium remains to be determined. Although, we previously have demonstrated that 218 the hAEC cultures recapitulates many characteristics of the in vivo airway epithelium, 219 including receptor distribution (36, 38). 220 In summary, we demonstrate that IDV replicates efficiently in an in vitro surrogate 221 model of the in vivo respiratory epithelium. This shows that there is no intrinsic impairment of 222 IDV propagation within the human respiratory epithelium and might explain why IDV-223 directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.",
