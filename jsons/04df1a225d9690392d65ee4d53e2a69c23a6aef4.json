Moreover, parents and children know they need help managing these circumstances. Perhaps for the first time, behavior analysts hold the reinforcers for increasing parental involvement in effective child-rearing practices. In fact, behavior analysts can help parents enlist their children in managing the household by framing their behavior in terms of hidden superpowers. In the current article, we argue that behavior analysts have a range of tools to offer that are grounded in evidence-based principles, strategies, and kernels-or essential units of behavioral influence. When combined into scheduled daily practices and invoked by children taught to see their use of the tools as nothing short of heroic, these practices function as \"vaccinations\" that inoculate families against toxic and unsafe behaviors.",

For many, staying home is an unprecedented demand. Day care, school, sports, clubs, playdates, and parties that ordinarily occupy time before dinner and bedtime are off limits. Many outlets are racing to post activities for parents to try with their children. Although these strategies could be effective for some children, they may inadvertently produce unwanted outcomes for others. For example, Amlen (2020) suggested quarantined parents ask their kids to play 20 Questions, a guessing game in which the aim is to identify a person, place, or thing by asking fewer than 20 questions. The game requires several component verbal repertoires, including intraverbal conditional discrimination and relational responding with respect to arbitrary conventional cues for size, hierarchy, distinction, and coordination. Social skills required include waiting to speak and tolerating ambiguity or periodic losses. Although this game may be fun for some typically developing children who already demonstrate these skills, others receiving behavior-analytic services may engage in aggression or escape behaviors during this game due to the complexity of the verbal skills involved or the advanced social requirements for delayed gratification and friendly competition.",

The Sierra Leonean Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016 followed just 12 years after the nation ended a brutal civil war. Reports of child abuse during Ebola soared compared to rates during the war, and importantly, the number of reported adverse childhood events that occurred in homes since then has not decreased (U.S. Department of State, 2011 State, , 2012 State, , 2013 State, , 2014 State, , 2015 State, , 2016 State, , 2017 State, , 2018 State, , 2019 . A behavioral interpretation of these figures would be that once parents learned the fastest way to decrease a child's unwanted behavior was to use corporal punishment, they resorted to this class of behavior even after the lockdown ended because the negative reinforcement it produced was immediate and certain. Because punishment does not directly teach an alternative response, it is possible that children's actions that led to these parent behaviors continued, thus potentially contributing to a loop of policedocumented child abuse that persists to this day.",

            "text": "The behavior-change strategies listed previously form the foundation upon which evidence-based kernels are situated. Embry (2008) and Embry (1984) described four distinct categories of evidence-based kernels that are easily taught and used in clinical contexts. Kernels may alter the potency of behavioral consequences. For example, making a prize bowl transparent and just out of a learner's reach increases the value of the reinforcers found within the bowl. Alternatively, kernels may affect behavior primarily via antecedent control. A red card placed on the kitchen door when it is off limits, and a green card placed on the door when it is okay to enter, is an evidence-based kernel that decreases dangerous behavior and increases engagement in other activities. Kernels may also affect behavior by evoking relational framing. When a parent reinforces sharing by saying, \"What you just did was great, Pietra. In this family we share because sharing is our superpower,\" the parent has promoted deictic framing, or perspective taking with respect to the family unit. The parent has also facilitated the child's use of hierarchical framingcategorizing \"sharing\" as a prosocial behavior that is likely to be reinforced by other family members. And the parent has formed an augmental, \"sharing is our superpower,\" a phrase that when repeated often alters the value of giving things away and helps evoke this behavior. Finally, kernels may affect behavior through physiology. Getting the family together for a run or a yoga session increases everyone's heart rates and reduces the adverse effects of being stationary within the house for long periods of time. Each of these kernels has an evidence base that is beyond the scope of this article to include. For a more thorough explanation, see Embry and Biglan (2008) .",

The whole point of handwashing as a public-health strategy is to reduce not only sepsis as described by Semmelweis (Pittet & Allegranzi, 2018) but also the epidemic. For example, Embry and colleagues used simple self-modeling stories to reduce pedestrian injuries to young children (Embry, 1984) , which could be easily adapted to children helping keep a home \"virus-free\" by washing their hands in a self-modeling story using mobile phone photos and a simple script (Embry, 1980 Together, these studies provide evidence that rules can help decrease problem behavior across various populations. This strategy of simply providing verbal and/ or written reminders of rules is particularly useful as it involves low-effort behavior on the part of the implementer. To whatever extent desired, the entire family can be involved in establishing acceptable rules to be followed within the household. An additional strategy would be to let children know that when they implement contingencies for each other, or remind each other of the rules, they are being heroic. Everyone needs a reminder once in a while. For example, most of us touch our faces often.",

Use activity schedules. Activity schedules can be utilized to help promote independent behavior (e.g., McClanahan & Krantz, 1999) , to increase on-task behavior (e.g., Bryan & Gast, 2000) , and to create smooth transitions between activities (e.g., Dooley, Wilczenski, & Torem, 2001) . Parents can be encouraged to construct interactive and visually stimulating textual and/or pictorial schedules to create structure in the home environment. This can help give structure around transitions during both typical home activities (e.g., getting ready in the morning) and not previously typical home activities (e.g., homeschooling, teleconferencing with teachers). In addition, to the extent possible, children can be included in creating the schedule and be given a choice in the order of activities (Kern et al., 1998; Watanabe & Sturmey, 2003) . Involving the children in the constructing of the schedule and providing them with choices may help promote a sense of independence and control over their own environment, especially at a time when there is little control over many other circumstances. 3. Teach parents to use timers. Timers can be used in a variety of ways. One evidence-based strategy is called \"Beat the Timer.\" In this exercise, learners are instructed that if they complete tasks before the timer runs out, they win a prize. Beat the Timer can be programmed with independent, interdependent, or dependent contingencies (Adams & Drabman, 1995; Ball & Irwin, 1976) . Be sure to set this up as a fun challenge and avoid a time-based requirement that may be stressful and result in negative punishment for \"trying.\" Timers can also be used to aid in transitions from one activity to the next and function as a visual or auditory cue for upcoming shifts among activities. The timer is a simple technology that can evoke appropriate behavior, increase the independence of the learner, and decrease response effort on the part of the parent. 4. Give \"tootles.\" Family members can be given a stack of cards with spaces for writing another person's name and what that person has done. They are instructed to look for others engaging in prosocial behavior and to write a \"tootle,\" or a praise note that can be posted on a wall, read aloud, or placed in a photo album of praiseworthy moments (Cabello & Terrell, 1994; Embry et al., 1996) . During family conflicts and other stressful situations, offering a tootle for something a sibling does is a remarkably heroic act that runs counter to most children's social conditioning and reinforcement histories. Yet doing so can defuse explosive situations and improve the likelihood of reciprocal reinforcement from others. Teaching children that giving tootles is a superpower and challenging them to try it and see what happens can improve their probability of contacting much-needed reciprocal reinforcement from their brothers and sisters.",

            "text": "Behavior analysts have begun to adopt strategies for teaching empathic responding and perspective taking with children diagnosed with autism (e.g., Schrandt, Townsend, & Poulson, 2009 ). In addition, these behaviors may be useful among siblings, children to parents, parents to children, and among partners and other family members to create therapeutic support networks and help build tolerance for or alleviate stress across the family unit (Arciniega, Szabo, & Tarbox, 2020; Szabo, 2019; Szabo et al., 2020) . For example, Arciniega et al. (2020) taught experimenters to use empathic statements when listening to the concerns of siblings who had been aggressive with children with autism, and then taught the participants to use similar empathic statements when engaging in activities with their siblings with autism. To further supplement this skill, members of the family may be taught to first engage in value-clarification exercises. For example, after drawing a coat of arms with four to six sections, family members can illustrate those aspects of their connection with each other that are of the highest value to them (Asen & Scholz, 2009 ). Sections of the coat of arms could include images of superpowers that family members use to protect one another's health and well-being. 2. Use a 5-min pause: acting without reacting. Stay-athome orders are likely to increase the frequency of verbal conflicts between parents. Children observe the actions of their parents, and if parent actions are reinforced, children are likely to imitate what they see. Parents may be negatively reinforced when using coercion in their interactions with each other, and thereby teach their children to do the same. Behavior analysts should discuss the way that these practices are transmitted from parents to their children through the parents' unintentional modeling of them. Parents can therefore be taught to pause before responding to conflict or stressful disagreements with others. The practice of pausing when agitated can be discussed with children as a heroic family value and established as a norm that is immediately reinforced by adults . 3. Use a Jumble Jar. Sitting still and remaining at family meals may be challenging for many children because it is not clear what they will talk about and because topics preferred by parents (e.g., the latest news on COVID-19) may not be preferred by children. A Jumble Jar provides structure to family meals and a simple way for members to connect with themselves and each other. A jar is filled with sentence starters, or \"jumbles,\" that family members take turns pulling from the jar and discussing during meals (e.g., Price & Nelson, 2019) . Family members should be instructed to use active listening skills (e.g., \"I hear you saying that you dream of going snorkeling because you want to learn about sea creatures.\") and to ask respondents to expand on shorter answers that they offer.",

Use daily visioning. Families can be instructed to begin their day by reciting a written statement of their family vision and constructing a list of activities for the day that are consistent with their vision. This can be combined with the creation of activity schedules, as described earlier. The daily vision can state the family's position on how to face challenges (e.g., \"Our family steps up to the plate when things get tough, and we do our part to help others.\"). The combination of the day's activities constitutes a vaccination schedule aimed at reducing toxic and unsafe behavior (Embry & Biglan, 2008) . 5. Use value-clarification exercises. Identifying patterns of behavior that orient toward large, remote reinforcers often makes engaging in these behaviors themselves reinforcing. One simple activity that can be repeated and modified each time it is used is the Life Timeline. Tape can be stretched out across the floor or carpet, and photos or drawings of important life events are then laid chronologically on top of the timeline tape. Family members can then take turns talking about how these events impacted them, what they learned, and how they use what they learned then in their current circumstances (Flentroy, Young, Blue, & Gilbert, 2015) .",

            "text": "Increasing Positive Reinforcement 1. Target and reinforce patience and resilience. In general, behavior analysts teach replacement behaviors that are functionally equivalent to unwanted behaviors. However, some situations in which children engage in escapemaintained behavior cannot or should not be escaped from. When ordered to stay at home, children must do so, even if the home environment is cramped and avoiding others is impossible. To address these situations, behavior analysts should teach tolerance to nonpreferred activities and situations using graduated exposure and reinforcement (e.g., Cook, Rapp, & Schulze, 2015; O'Rourke, Richling, Brogan, McDougale, & Rapp, 2019) . Increasing rates of, lengthening durations of, or shortening delays to reinforcement improve the efficiency and effectiveness of graduated exposure to nonpreferred activities and situations. Additionally, verbal augmentals such as \"Superheroes model being patient with their sisters and brothers. I love seeing you show your brother how to be so patient\" serve to increase the reinforcing effectiveness of others seeing a child behaving resiliently. 2. Make use of group contingencies among siblings. The PAX Good Behavior Game (PAX GBG; Turkkan, 1988) is a set of practices that improve norms in the home environment. The school-based version of the PAX GBG is being used in more than 50,000 classrooms across three nations and is impacting more than a million children and their families (PAXIS Institute, 2018) . Empirical studies have shown behavioral and protective benefits in terms of problem-behavior reduction (Embry, 2002) , improved physical health (Krug et al., 1997) , and improved emotional health (Jiang, Santos, Josephson, Mayer, & Boyd, 2018; Wilson, Hayes, Biglan, & Embry, 2014) . In the home environment, behavior analysts can ask families to map the things that they would like to see, hear, feel, and do more of and also less of in their homes. The map of these four kinds of events can be colorful and pictorial if doing so will serve as a discrimination and self-regulation aid. The PAX GBG follows and is used anytime the family engages in challenging activities, such as personal care routines or academic tasks. The family can be divided into teams, and for the duration of the game, one parent announces how each team is doing. Parents can also be members of the teams in smaller families. For 1 min at first, and subsequently longer intervals afterward, teams aim to remain focused and engaged in specified, desirable (\"good\") behaviors. After each interval, teams that met the criterion celebrate with 10-s giggle fests, tickles, or other preferred activities. As with other practices in this section, the PAX GBG can be mixed with other kernels to promote desired family norms (Jack et al., 2020) . The classroom version can be easily adapted to fit family contexts (Embry & Biglan, 2008) , and the general strategy has had systematic and direct replications in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia presently (e.g., Kellam & Anthony, 1998; Kellam et al., 2014) . 3. Incorporate games to provide opportunities for frequent reinforcement.",

Turning academics into games adds play and adventure to tasks that might otherwise be difficult to engage children in. In Math Mountain, a rock cliff is climbed in several \"pitches\" or rope lengths. Each player leads a pitch by solving a math problem that is adjusted to his or her individual math skill level. When each player has solved a problem, the team arrives at the top of the mountain and must now rappel down the other side by each person solving another problem. Teammates earn bonuses for helping each other without solving the problems for each other. Parents can include metaphors to transform the functions of the aversive properties of math (e.g., teammates may be encouraged to \"climb past Frustration Yeti\") or may use metaphors to reconnect with family values (e.g., \"We are all tied together on the same rope in this climb. In this family, no one gets left behind. And if you fall off the cliff by getting a problem wrong, I promise I'll use our climbing rope to catch you, and you will be safe to climb back up.\").",

Antecedent strategies are simple and useful to decrease the chance of problem behavior occurring at the level of the individual and also for groups of individuals (e.g., McDougale et al., 2019) . Parents can be taught to utilize timers to deliver noncontingent attention and interest in the form of asking questions or making comments about an activity the child is engaged in or providing statements of empathic support on manageable, periodic, time-based schedules. 2. Designated activity spaces/rooms. It may be helpful for some learners who have difficulty transitioning from one activity to the next to be provided with visual cues, such as pictures, indicating the next activity on an activity schedule so that they can match that visual cue to one placed where that activity is to take place (Schmit, Alper, Raschke, & Ryndak, 2000) . Designating areas or rooms within the home for specific activities (e.g., meditation, work, art) may help to promote stimulus control and increase compliance and on-task behavior. The family and children may come up with fun names for the designated spaces and correspond them to the activity schedule.",

Similarly, to help with potential sleep problems, children should not be allowed to do schoolwork or watch television in bed. Instead, a nighttime routine can be established that involves activities such as bathing, brushing teeth, being read to, and so on to help evoke compliance and elicit sleep (Marquenie, Rodger, Mangohig, & Cronin, 2011) . 3. Present-moment exercises. There are simply too many stimuli competing for our attention during the COVID-19 crisis. Both overt stimuli (e.g., social media, television news) and covert verbal stimuli (e.g., thoughts and worries about what the future may bring) can distract much-needed attention away from effective parent-child interaction strategies. Paying attention to present-moment stimuli is a behavioral skill repertoire that can be strengthened and generalized through practice and reinforcement across multiple tasks, settings, times of day, and sensory modalities (Little, Tarbox, & Alzaabi, 2020) .",

Human behavior that is otherwise easily distracted by worries about the past and the future can be refocused on the present moment by asking family members to pet and find the softest part of their animal. This is often a preferred activity for pets and children alike (Feuerbacher & Wynne, 2015) . Try taking a few deep, slow breaths while petting the pet and really focus on the tactile experiences of the warmth and texture of the fur. Try connecting that experience to other more difficult aspects of your life (e.g., \"If I can be this in the moment right now, maybe I can really be present while struggling with homeschooling my child.\"). Five-min daily meditation. Useful for the whole family, meditation can be done lying down, walking, jogging in place, and even while doing household chores. Incorporate \"doing one thing and one thing only\" into each family member's activity schedule to improve focus and reduce defective stimulus control (Lunsky, Fung, Lake, Steel, & Bryce, 2018) . Daily meditation has been shown to improve challenging behaviors in individuals with developmental disabilities, both through direct training and via parent training (Singh & Hwang, 2020) . As with other new behaviors, it is important to use graduated exposure. A 1-min meditation may be the best place to start. Also, you can increase the value of this activity by teaching parents to let everyone know that even superheroes need to recharge their batteries, and this is how they do it. Parents can model doing one thing, and one thing only, by putting away their phones for fixed and specified periods of time, for example, while helping their child with a particular task. 5-4-3-2-1. It is easy to become overly focused on the past or the future; 5-4-3-2-1 encourages learners to bring their attention back to the present moment.",
