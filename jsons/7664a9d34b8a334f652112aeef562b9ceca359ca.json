All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: -10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the prelockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 -April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.",

Since people's movements and industrial activities are closed down for weeks, it is expected that pollution loads to the environment also get decreased. As expected, in a matter of days, the carbon emissions level has dropped significantly (Stone, 2020) . According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China, the air quality went up 11% in the category 'good' in as many as 337 cities (Henriques, 2020) . Scripps Institute of Oceanography reported that the use of fossil fuel would decline by about 10 percent around the world owing to the COVID-19 spread (SCRIPPS, 2020) .

Satellite-based data from Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on ESA's Sentinel-5 satellite and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite shows a decreased level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere (ESA, 2020) . On the other hand, the status of pollution in the hydrosphere that includes lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater reservoirs, has not been investigated. For decades, the hydrosphere has been severely polluted because of rapid urbanization, industrialization, and overexploitation. During the lockdown period, the major industrial sources of pollution that affect aquatic ecosystems, such as industrial wastewater disposal, crude oil, heavy metals, and plastics (H\u00e4der et al. 2020) , have shrunk or completely stopped. Therefore, the level of pollution is expected to be reduced. For example, news media reported that the Grand Canal in Italy, where the COVID-19 crippled the whole nation, turned clear, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reappearances of many aquatic species (Clifford, 2020) . Similarly, the Ganges, a sacred but severely polluted river in India, turns cleaner at several places during the nationwide lockdown period that started on 21 st March 2020 (Mani, 2020) .",

The lake area covers approximately 250 km 2 and its catchment area including seven small river basins covers more than 14,000 km 2 (Padmalal et al., 2008) . The lake is one of the famous scenic attractions in the state. It has also been served as a livelihood for the local population in the form of tourism and aquaculture being the main income source. The lake is polluted severely -the abundance of microplastics recorded from the sediment samples is as high as 496 particles m \u22122 (Sruthy and Ramasamy, 2017) . High concentrations of toxic elements such as mercury are reported from surface and subsurface sediment samples, as well as from fish samples (Mohan et al., 2014; Ramasamy et al., 2017) .

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) caused by sedimentation, siltation, sewage disposal, other pollutants, metals, and bacteria results in high turbidity in aquatic environments. In the earliest literature, a Secchi disk was used to measure water transparency or turbidity. However, field-based methods have inherent limitations in spatial coverage because of the time and cost of observation. With the advent of remote sensing techniques, researchers investigated the relationship between turbidity and reflectance in waters bodies (Curran et al., 1987; Novo et al., 1989) . The results of these studies are promising and showed that reflectance increases with increasing turbidity. For instance, Doxaran et al. (2002) concluded that reflectance between 400 and 1000 nm increases with turbidity, in particular, when the turbidity level is 35 to 250 mg/l, the reflectance between 400 and 700 nm correlates well with the turbidity. Several empirical calibrated models have been developed using linear, log-linear, non-linear, and exponential relationship with reflectance J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 products from satellite images in the visible spectrum (Dogliotti et al., 2015; Doxaran et al., 2003; Nechad et al., 2010; Song et al., 2011; Sravanthi et al., 2013; Tassan, 1994; Wass et al., 1997) . With a large number of optical satellite sensor orbiting the earth, mapping of turbidity in aquatic environments in the form of surface SPM or total suspended matter (TSM) has been widely conducted using Landsat, Spot, SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS Aqua and Terra, OceanSAT, Sentinel-2, and recently released Sentinel-3 OLCI images (e.g., Ritchie et al., 1990; Tassan, 1994; Vanhellemont and Ruddick, 2014; Wei et al., 2018) .

On the other hand, the northern zones (A -E) located close to the mouth of the Vembanad lake opening to the Arabian Sea recorded the lowest SPM concentrations in previous years (e.g. 2016). A possible explanation is that seawater intrusion into the lake during the high tide condition, which is typical in this region, could alter the original state of lake biophysical parameters at the closest points to the mouth. Balchand and Nair (1994) reported that saline water intrusion from the Arabian Sea to the Vembanad lake is as much as 26 km from the bar mouth during the pre-monsoon period, both at surface and subsurface levels. Thus, variation in SPM concertation even when the industrial activities are shut is possible at A -E. Further, zones L, O, R and T also recorded their lowest SPM concentration not in 2020, possibly because of their closeness to the river mouths on the south-eastern margin. The percentage decrease in SPM tabulated for April 2020 is, up to 34% from the previous minima (Table A .1). 1 for zone identification).",

We selected one of the severely polluted freshwater lakes in India to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 spread on water quality. The analysis of SPM concentrations in Vembanad lake based on the Landsat-8 OLI data revealed that the concentrations during the lockdown period were lower than those in the pre-lockdown period by 15.9% on average (-10.3% -36.4%). The decrease was observed in 18 out of 20 zones of the lake. Eleven of the zones showed that the concentration was the lowest in April of 2013 -2020 (Table A .1). While non-industrial pollution (e.g. discharge of domestic wastewater) remained during the lockdown period, our results suggested that pollution from industries and tourism had a severe impact on lake water quality. As we have limited satellite data during the lockdown period, further analysis using longer time-series data that include the post-lockdown period (presumably starting from 3 rd May 2020) is needed to confirm the effect of industrial pollution load on lake water quality. Another potential extension of this work is to apply MODIS Terra 250 m archived data to derive the time series SPM that dates back to the year 2000. One of the advantages of the remote-sensing-based water quality analysis (over on-site observation) is that we can evaluate past water quality as long as cloud-free satellite images are available. We recommend similar works in other environmental settings to understand the overall impact of COVID-19 in the hydrosphere.",

In another study,Vinita et al. (2017)  showed that the in situ SPM measured in the lake ranged between 20 mg/l (wet season minimum) and101 mg/l (dry season maximum). Both aforementioned studies suggested that the turbidity level in the lake is less than 110 mg/l throughout the year. Nechad et al. (2010) proposed a single band empirical algorithm to retrieve the SPM concentrations for waters where SPM value is below the range of 110 mg/l. Considering both analyses reported a similar range of turbidity, it is safe to assume that applying the Nechad et al. (2010) empirical model can retrieve SPM with an RMS error of less than 10 mg/l.The SPM is computed from water-leaving reflectance (Rrs) of the red band (655 nm) using the following equation(Nechad et al., 2010):where is Rrs from the red band (655 nm), A and C are empirical coefficients: A = 289.29 and C = 0.1686.",

Visual interpretation ofFig. 2clearly shows a decrease in SPM concentration during the lockdown period. For quantitative verification, the lake area was divided into 20 zones (seeFig. 1). Eighteen out of the 20 a decrease in the SPM concentration, showing that the decrease was observed in the almost entire lake. Comparing the average SPM concentrations of the period of lockdown (31st March and 16th April) with those of the pre-lockdown period (28th February and 15th March), a significant decrease in SPM concentrations was observed (15.9% on average; range: -10.3 -36.4%) (Table 2). The mean values of SPM in each zone decreased to a maximum of 8 mg/l. One can argue that the decrease in SPM concentrations can be attributed to the intermonthly variation in the suspended loads from the 7 small rivers in the lake catchment. In order to nullify the effect of inter-monthly variation, time-series SPM analysis for images from April 2013 (Landsat-8 OLI launched in 2013) to April 2020 was conducted. Altogether, eight Landsat scenes are available for the time series analysis; the results are presented inFig. 3.",
