The extremely rapid international spread of the disease with significant morbidity and mortality made finding possible therapeutic interventions a global priority. While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients. Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment. Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies. While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rational the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.",

CQ can also affect early stage of virus replication by inhibiting virus-endosome fusion, likely via increasing endosomal pH [41] . CoVs such as SARS-CoV were shown to be able to enter target cells via pH-dependent mechanism in which the acidic pH of the lysosome triggers fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes resulting in viral particle uncoating and subsequent release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm [42] . CQ can also impair posttranslational modifications of viral proteins through interfering with proteolytic processes [43] and inhibition of glycosylation via specific interactions with sugarmodifying enzymes or glycosyltransferases [28] . CQ can also hamper lysosomal protein degradation and lysosomal fusion with autophagosomes [44] [45] [46] . Moreover, it has been suggested that CQ has the ability to affect the cytotoxic mechanisms and works as antiautophagy agent in vitro [47] . CQ works as anti-inflammatory agent through reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) release and suppressing TNF receptors on monocytes [26, 28] .",

            "text": "However, a full understanding of these parameters has been challenging despite the numerous reported studies. Generally, PK parameters for CQ and HCQ are comparable (Table 1) [54, 55] . Following oral administration of CQ and HCQ, their bioavailability can reach up to 80% with plasma peak time around 2-4 hours [56] [57] [58] . Thus, parenteral administration, if available, might be a better route especially that oral administration has shown huge interpatient variability [56, 59, 60] . The long half-life of both CQ and HCQ which could range from 30 to 60 days is likely attributed to their large volume of distribution (200 to 800 L/kg) and extensive tissue uptake [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . CQ and HCQ are metabolized via CYP-450 enzymes to other active compounds, which are responsible for the extended pharmacological actions and increased toxicity [61, 69] . Up to 60% of CQ and HCQ is primarily excreted renally as unchanged or metabolized forms, and the remaining (40%) is usually cleared through the liver, feces and skin or stored in other lean body tissues [54, [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . It's important to note that CQ and HCQ have a chiral center, which produces two enantiomers R(\u2212) or S(+) forms or isomers [75] , in which little is known about the differences in their pharmacological activity and their corresponding metabolites. Most clinically used CQ and HCQ exist as a racemic mixture (50:50) of both isomers which complicates the understanding of their PK and associated toxicity as they could behave differently inside the body [57, [75] [76] [77] .",

These toxicities could be related to the very long half-life and the large volume of distribution of both drugs. One of the significant toxic effects of CQ and HCQ is the possible ocular pigmentation due to their binding to melanin, which could lead to damage in different parts of the eye including the cornea, ciliary body and retina [88] . Notably, the incidence of such ocular toxicity is usually rare. For instance, it was shown that only 0.5% out of ~400 patients treated with HCQ (\u22646.5 mg/kg/day) for 6 years due to RA or SLE had developed ocular related complications [89] . Most studies have shown that such complications might only occur with long term treatment of chronic diseases which extends for more than 5 years with doses above or equal to 6.5 mg/kg/day [90, 91] . However, ocular toxicity and changes could still occur with shorter treatments. Other complications such as development of proximal myopathy associated with respiratory failure have also been reported in patients treated with either CQ or HCQ [92] [93] [94] [95] . Nonetheless, most of these complications were seen in elderly patients with an average age of 70 years suffering from chronic RA or autoimmune diseases.",

Since then, several studies have tested the ability of CQ and HCQ to inhibit the replication of a wide range of CoVs and non-CoV viruses in vitro as shown in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. The majority of 9 these studies have revealed a substantial ability of CQ and HCQ as well as some of their derivatives to inhibit viral replication with no to low toxicity. Specifically, CQ has been shown to inhibit the replication of different CoVs including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 among others in several studies (Table 2) [37, [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] . Only two studies showed no significant inhibitory effects of CQ on MERS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV4) [116, 117] . Other CQ derivatives such as amodiaquine (AMD), Ferroquine (FQ), Hydroxy ferroquine (HFQ) have been also shown to exerts some antiviral activity [105, 106] .",

Furthermore, it was shown that CQ could lead to disease exacerbation correlating with increased type I IFN response and delayed immune responses in CHIKV infected macaques [133] , increased mortality rate of SFV-infected mice [154] and NiV or HeV infected hamsters [148] .",

These published clinical trials have clearly shown no significant benefit of using CQ in the prevention or treatment against influenza, DENV or CHIKV infections in patients [133, [155] [156] [157] [158] . In fact, in one study, patients treated with CQ were more likely to develop adverse effects such as arthralgia at day 200 post-treatment [157] . On the other hand, few studies have reported that HCQ could decease HIV-1 viremia, stabilize CD4 T cell count and reduce IL-6 and IgG levels in infected patients [159] , although others showed contradicting finding of increased HIV RNAemia in HCQ treated patients [160, 161] . Interestingly, while few clinical studies have suggested that the use of HCQ alone or with azithromycin (AZT) could be beneficial for COVID-19 patients as it reduces viral shedding and time to clinical recovery [162] [163] [164] , others have reported no effect in infected patients [165, 166] . However, it is important to note that most of these studies have several limitations in study designs with small sample sizes. Nonetheless, around 104 clinical trials are ongoing in different countries to asses and evaluate the therapeutic and prophylactic effects of both CQ and/or HCQ in COVID-19 patients (Table 6 ).",

Nevertheless, while our literature review showed that this is quite rare, it is not yet evident whether there would be any additive or possible synergistic risk when these drugs are combined with other medications such as AZT [83] . In fact, it is challenging to base a treatment decision in the absence of a complete research cycle and a clear vision of drug efficacy and safety. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rational the use of these drugs in 13 COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.",

(1) CQ and HCQ inhibit virus binding to its cell surface receptor, (2) CQ inhibits sialic acid biosynthesis through suppressing quinone reductase 2 activity which affect ACE2 receptor activity, (3) CQ and HCQ inhibit virus pH-dependent endocytosis through increasing pH, (4) CQ interferes with virus uncoating, (5) CQ interferes with assembly/budding leading to accumulation of viral vesicles within trans-Golgi network, (6) CQ interferes with lysosomal protein degradation and lysosomal fusion with autophagosomes. HCQ can interfere with lysosomal activity and prevent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, (7) CQ interferes with TNF release and binding from macrophages and/to monocytes, (8) CQ inhibits phosphorylation of P38 MAPK and caspase in Th1 cells which in turn inhibits proinflammatory cytokines production and virus replication, (9) HCQ blocking of MCH expression prevents T cell activation, expression of CD145 and cytokines release, (10) HCQ impairs TLR signaling through increasing endosomal pH and interfering with TLR7 and TLR9 binding to their DNA/RNA ligands thereby inhibiting transcription of proinflammatory genes, (11) HCQ inhibits the binding of DNA to the cGAS and therefore reduce cytokines transcription and production.
