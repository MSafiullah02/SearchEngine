In this paper, we propose a Temporal Convolutional Network with ATTention (TCN-ATT) architecture, which processes sequences with high parallelization and is robust to sequence length. The proposed TCN-ATT consists of three components: (1) a TCN module which processes sequence with convolutional structure, (2) an attention layer to select effective features and (3) a split-and-combine mechanism to fit inputs with various size. A formalized deduplication method is also proposed to reduce redundancy with less information loss. According to our experiments, the proposed model reaches an accuracy of 98.60% and reduces time cost by over 60% compared with existing RNN-based models.",

Malware attacks have also increased greatly in both quantities and categories. Malware detectors based on signature database [1, 6, 17] or static analysis [14] are faced with increasing difficulty because they are often vulnerable to obfuscation methods [11] . So many researchers put effort into dynamic analysis and develop algorithms to identify malicious programs through their behaviors. In dynamic analyses, system API call sequences are most frequently used to represent the behaviors of programs. Data mining and traditional machine learning methods are often employed to handle malware detection tasks based on API call sequences [7, 15, 19] . These methods usually require low dimensional statistical features as the input and thus expertise-based feature engineering is necessary. These requirements lead to a bottleneck in accuracy.",

These RNNbased models reach better accuracy than data mining and traditional machine learning methods but challenges still exist. The recurrent architecture causes inevitable low parallelization when processing and brings uncertainty in receptive field size on input sequences. Furthermore, recently published models become increasingly complicated and are combined with various other analysis methods. In this situation, we propose a Temporal Convolutional Network with ATTention (TCN-ATT) architecture, which is a relatively simple and effective nonrecurrent model, to detect malwares based on API call sequences. Noticing that the length of API call sequences varies from 100 to 20000, these whole sequences are not proper inputs for either recurrent or convolutional models.

[10] and Xiaofeng et al. [18] mentioned some methods to remove continuous same API functions in sequences. [10] dose not consider the case of repetition of an API group and [18] simply removes all the duplicates. In this paper we propose a deduplication method which is similar to theirs but more flexible. In our consideration, the duplicates of an API call subsequence pattern should be reduced to avoid information redundancy but should not be totally removed because the repetition itself contains program behavior information. So, we define two parameters for the duplicate reducing method: l m , the max length of a target pattern; k, the max number of consecutive duplicates kept for a pattern.

Thus the input of the TCN model will be the subsequences instead of the whole API call sequence. Sequence splitting also brings a benefit that the size of the model only depends on the subsequence length setting regardless of whole sequence size. A proper subsequence length n for the model is chosen by experiments, which will be described in Sect. 4.4. Although this method solves the issue of sequence length variation, it brings some difficulties in combining partial results into a sample-level classification conclusion. Therefore, a task-specific loss for training phase and a result-combining method for predicting phase are designed to cooperate with splitting method, which will be described in Sect. 3.4.",

A set of 1000 samples is randomly selected from our dataset and is expanded to 10000 by repeating samples. Experiments are conducted in both training phase and testing phase on this dataset and the time cost of each model is recorded. This is performed on TCN-ATT model as well as RNN/LSTM/GRU with splitting and attention mechanism. In these experiments, only one GPU is used in case that TCN can run on multi-GPU mode while recurrent models are not able to. All models involved use settings that can reach the best accuracy as described in Sect. 4.3 and the batch size is set to 32. Table 4 shows the results. As expected, LSTM and GRU cost more time than the original RNN while reaching higher accuracy. However, taking advantage of convolutional architectures, TCN-ATT outperforms above three recurrent models in terms of time cost. It saves time by 62% in training and 60% in testing compared with the GRU+attention model. So it's indicated that the TCN-ATT model has not only high accuracy but also excellent efficiency.",

A temporal convolutional module and an attention layer are employed for stronger feature extraction ability. We also design a sequence splitting method and a task specific loss to enhance robustness for long sequences while controlling the model size. For sequence preprocessing, a formalized deduplication method with two parameters is proposed. It brings accuracy rise for our architecture and other sequence-based models. With above techniques, the proposed architecture obtains an accuracy of 98.60% and reduces time cost by over 60% compared with recurrent models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is an effective classifier for automatic malware detection task. In the future, a sub-prediction combining method with more intelligence technique can be designed to bring more robustness and adaptability. Furthermore, analyses on attention layer values can be conducted to find out what the model focuses on and help to improve the performance.",

A LSTM-based model containing two bidirectional layers with residual connection proposed by Xiaofeng et al. [18]. -TCN-ATT. The proposed model in this paper. The dropout rate is 0.5 and single feature size (c in Sect. 3) is 128 for RNNs/LSTMs/GRUs/TCNs envolved.
