The 156\u2010ha property consisted of improved pastures with a total population of 300 Angus and Murray Grey purebred cows or their crosses with Limousin and Charolais bulls. The cattle were segregated in groups of 25 head in 4\u2010ha paddocks with a central feed trough, but shared water troughs on the fence lines. The production system was characterised by frequent turnover of stock, with weekly slaughter of 15\u201325 animals after approximately 70 days on a ration of cereal hay, biscuit meal and dried distillers\u2019 grain. Replacement cattle were sourced at approximately 9 months of age, predominantly from saleyards, but also directly from breeder's holdings, and were transported up to 450 km. The newly purchased cattle were held in a nearby holding, in groups of 40\u201360 head, for 1 week prior to introduction to the feedlot. During this time they were vaccinated with a 5\u2010in\u20101 clostridial vaccine (Ultravac, Pfizer, West Ryde, NSW, Australia), drenched with triclabendazole (Fasinex 240, Novartis, West Ryde, NSW, Australia) and fenbendazole (Panacur 100, Coopers Animal Health, Bendigo, VIC, Australia) and dosed with an oral chelated trace element mixture (Maxi\u2010Min\u00ae, Virbac, Milperra, NSW, Australia). Treatment with the clostridial vaccine and trace element preparation was repeated after 4 weeks.",

Exposure to BVDV occurred prior to entry to the feedlot in cohorts 1 and 2, but active transmission in cohort 3, may have contributed to the course of disease through immunosuppression.22 An assay to detect antibodies to BCoV was not available during this study. Such an assay could provide a sensitive herd test for BCoV infection because a study in feedlots in the USA indicated that seroconversion occurred at higher prevalence and persisted for a greater period of time compared with viral shedding.23 Detailed analysis of production and morbidity data in combination with serology could assist in determining the effect of BCoV infection, but pathogen detection is required to discriminate between respiratory and enteric infections.24\n",

A similar qRT\u2010PCR assay for BCoV detected as few as 10 copies of viral RNA in clinical specimens.26 However, the detection of BCoV by qRT\u2010PCR can be affected by differences in the RNA sequence in the target region of the genome.27 The qRT\u2010PCR assay used in the present study was designed using nucleotide sequence from a recent isolate of BCoV that caused neonatal diarrhoea in Australian calves.13 The assay amplified a target in the ORF1b region, which is a relatively conserved portion of the coronavirus genome.27 It is unclear if different strains of BCoV are responsible for enteric and respiratory syndromes. Antigenic and phylogenetic differences between isolates of BCoV from enteric and respiratory disease have been identified28, 29 and the quasispecies structure of BCoV produces nucleotide sequence variation within a single isolate.30 However, in other cases, isolates of BoCV with >98% phylogenetic similarity have been identified in enteric and respiratory disease31 and an isolate of BCoV from a case of winter dysentery demonstrated both respiratory and enteric tropism after experimental infection.32 Phylogenetic differences between BCoV isolates from different geographical locations are greater than the differences between isolates from different clinical syndromes.29, 33 Further characterisation of BCoV isolates from Australian cattle is required and the potential for variation in the genome sequence needs to be considered when interpreting qRT\u2010PCR assays.",

Multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells have been observed previously in the lungs of cattle with viral infection.18 In the present cases, the syncytia were confined to the bronchioles, whereas syncytia associated with BSRV may be found in both airways and alveoli.34Syncytial cells have been also observed in humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV).35 Hyperplasia of BALT in the lungs of some cattle is suggestive of infection with Mycoplasma spp.,36 but these organisms were not cultured and M. bovis was not detected by qPCR in the present investigation. Interestingly, hyperplasia of BALT was observed after experimental infection of ferrets with SARS\u2010CoV.37\n",

In Canada, calves with low neutralising titres for BCoV were more likely to require treatment for respiratory disease after commingling in a feedlot.39 Furthermore, intranasal administration of an infectious, modified BoCV vaccine reduced the risk of clinical signs of respiratory disease after feedlot entry in an experimental trial in the USA.40\n",
