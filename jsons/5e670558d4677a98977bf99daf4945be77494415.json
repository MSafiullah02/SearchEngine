Participants were healthy men and women aged 18-55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18\u00b75-30\u00b70 kg/m\u00b2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1 \u00d7 10\u2077 plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1 \u00d7 10\u2078 PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-\u03b3-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23",

Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime-boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1-3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=0\u00b786 [95% CI 0\u00b76960-0\u00b79427], p=0\u00b70001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group.",

Although optimal animal models for the identification of protective immune correlates for MERS are still scarce, current mouse models suggest a crucial role for antibodies and T cells in the induction of protective immunity. [6] [7] [8] In humans, one study showed a positive correlation of CD4 T-cell responses and neutralising antibodies with severe disease progression, and a positive correlation of strong virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses with reduced mor bidity; 9 conversely, another study reported a positive association between early CD8 T-cell responses and disease severity in acute MERS-CoV infection. 10 A role of antibodies in protection was shown in mice that received convalescent sera from survivors. 9 The animal and human data underline that a MERS vaccine candidate should preferentially induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and that the timing and dose of a vaccine could be crucial for protection.",

MERS is under active surveillance scrutiny by WHO, and so far there is no licensed vaccine available to prevent disease and viral spread. MVA-MERS-S, a novel vaccine candidate based on the recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine vector platform, has been reported to be safe and immunogenic in mice and dromedary camels. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov on Aug 23, 2019, with the keywords \"MERS\" and \"vaccine\"; five studies were listed. Except for one study that evaluated immunoglobulins as treatment against MERS, the other four tested MERS vaccine platforms. Three of these vaccine platforms were to be tested in phase 1 trials: ChAdox1, MVA, and a DNA vaccine, with the latter progressing to a phase 1/2a trials. The DNA vaccine phase 1 trial was done in the USA and a phase 1/2a study was recently initiated in Seoul (South Korea). The first human data on a MERS vaccine candidate were published in July, 2019, presenting the safety and immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine candidate GLS-5300. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity data of the first MVA viral vector vaccine candidate against MERS proceeding to clinical trials.",

All participants experienced transient, self-limiting, mild-to-moderate adverse events, mostly dose-dependent local reactions as well as unspecific systemic adverse events. These data demonstrate a favourable safety profile for both doses and two administrations. Safety signals were similar to those observed in a phase 1 trial testing the influenza vaccine MVA-H5-sfMR, 18 in which participants received the same doses with the identical MVA backbone. Similar safety profiles have been observed in other trials using the MVA platform with inserted antigens derived from pathogens. 11, 12, 19 Comparison of MVA-MERS-S vaccine-induced safety profiles suggests vector-specific rather than insertspecific safety signals. No MERS-CoV-specific adverse events as outlined by the Brighton Collaboration were observed. Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses to MERS-CoV spike, which were mostly detectable following boost rather than prime immunisation. The humoral immune responses, measured by ELISA and two different viral neutralisation assays, revealed a peak of antibody responses at days 42 and 56, were maintained through day 84, and declined to baseline levels in the majority of study participants by end of study (6 months after vaccination). Although the exact contribution of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies to immune protection against MERS remains to be further elucidated, preclinical data support their role in protection against virus challenge in animal models. 6, 9, 20, 21 A significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts in MVA-MERS-S-vaccinated dromedary camels was observed following MERS-CoV challenge that was associated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies. 16 Albeit not an optimal animal model, mouse studies can support the investigation into protective mechanisms. Mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, but with expression of human DPP4 (transgenic mice or adenoviral-mediated delivery), MERS-CoV can infect mouse cells and challenge experiments can be supported. The impact of antibodies on immune protection through passive immunotherapy with subsequent challenge experi ments was evaluated. Passive immunotherapy before MERS-CoV challenge using MERS-CoV-specific mono clonal antibodies or sera obtained from MERS-CoV-positive immune dromedary camels showed protection in mice expressing human DPP4. [20] [21] [22] Although safety and tolerability of anti-MERS-CoV polyclonal antibody treat ment in humans has been demonstrated, 23 protection against MERS in humans has not yet been documented.",

            "text": "Notably, mouse experiments demonstrated the generation of neutralising antibodies upon MVA-MERS-S vaccination, which only partially mediated neutralisation by the receptor-binding domain (RBD), 6 indicating that other parts of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein might also induce neutralising antibodies. In this context, a notable outcome of the mouse experiments was the protective capacity of S1-specific non-RBD and S2-specific neutralising mouse antibodies against MERS-CoV. 6, 7, 24 Furthermore, it was demonstrated that S2 monoclonal antibodies showed only moderate neutralising capacity in vitro but were highly protective from challenge in vivo, suggesting that strong neutralising activity is not conditional for protection. 7 Future analyses should therefore include not only MERS-CoV S1-specific but also S2specific antibody assays, and other functional antibody read-outs beyond neutralisation capacity, which are currently understudied. Systems-serology approaches including non-neutralising functions such as antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis might provide insight into MVA-MERS-S-induced immunity and dissect addi tional mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection. However, it should be noted that although animal studies indicate a crucial role for antibodies in protection against MERS, the human data available from MERS-CoV-infected individuals so far did not reveal a clear and strong correlation between MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses and MERS-CoV viral load. 25, 26 Reports on individuals with MERS-CoV infection revealed predominantly T-cell responses as opposed to antibody responses in survivors as well as exposed dromedary camel workers. 9, 27 Although it has not yet been determined that T-cell responses are crucial for MERS-CoV clearance in humans, animal models have provided evidence that T cells support viral clearance in mice. 8, 15 In this study, we detected vaccine-induced T-cell responses against MERS-CoV spike, which were present even before the second immunisation. Responses persisted until day 180 in a third of study participants (seven [32%] of 22 participants), suggesting that vaccine-induced T-cell responses were maintained slightly longer than humoral immune responses (three [14%] of 22 participants). We observed stronger and more robust T-cell responses in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. Although this finding was not significant, it might be considered in future studies that focus on dose finding when including a larger number of participants. However, the exact contribution of T-cell immunity to vaccine-induced or natural protection against the disease and viral clearance remains to be determined and needs further investigation.",

Although MVA-specific neutralising antibodies were induced, no correlation with MERS-CoV-specific binding or neutralising antibody responses was observed. Currently, there is no strong evidence that induced or preexisting MVA-specific immunity interferes with vaccineinduced immune responses when using MVA as a vector. Our study and the trial using MVA-H5-sfMR 18 show that MVA-based vaccines can elicit antibody responses against the antigenic insert following the second and third immunisation, despite the induction of anti-vector immunity after the prime injection.

In the context of limited human data on correlates of protection, it is currently challenging to predict whether MVA-MERS-S is suitable for rapidly evolving epidemic situations, because it remains unclear which specific parameters are relevant for the defence against MERS-CoV. It is conceivable that homologous MVA prime-boost vaccination might not be the final and optimised vaccination schedule for MVA-MERS-S. Different strategies including heterologous prime-boost regimens should be evaluated in future trials. Several MERS vaccine candidates are currently being tested in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is funding five different vaccine platforms, with MVA-MERS-S, ChAdOx1, and DNA being the most advanced. In the first MERS vaccine trial in humans reported to date, which investigated a DNA-based vaccine (GLS-5300), 28 a homologous primeboost-boost regime was used. Similar to our study, the authors observed a favourable safety profile and induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses.
