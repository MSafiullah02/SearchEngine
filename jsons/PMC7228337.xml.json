Typically, the flex\u2010base (1 \u03bcmol) and thymidine used as the 2\u2032\u2010deoxyribose donor (4 \u03bcmol) were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of LlNDT (different amounts of enzyme) in a 10 mm citrate buffer (0.1 mL) at the optimum pH of 6.5. Due to the low water solubility of flex\u2010bases, the transferase reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 % v/v DMSO in the medium.42 The rate of glycosylation (% conversion) was monitored by analytical reversed\u2010phase HPLC as a function of time and enzyme concentration (Table 1). The incubation temperature (37 in place of 50 \u00b0C) was selected in an attempt to optimize the enzyme activity and further isolate all the possible glycosylated products. Indeed, we previously showed that it is possible to manage the regioselectivity of the transferase reaction (N1 vs. N3) of some 4\u2010substituted imidazole derivatives.43 All the glycosylation products were purified by reversed\u2010phase HPLC, and their chemical structures, particularly the glycosylation site, were confirmed by NMR analysis.\n",

Experimental conditions were designed to manage the regioselectivity in the NDT\u2010catalyzed transfer reaction (i.e., at the N1 versus N3 position of the imidazole ring) and also the bis\u2010glycosylation side reaction (at the pyrimidine nitrogen). Thus, proximal fleximers in both deoxy and ribose series are easily obtained from flex\u2010bases 1 and 2 by transglycosylation catalyzed by NDT and PNPase, respectively. On the other hand, distal fleximers are not accessible from the corresponding flex\u2010bases 3 and 4, as glycosylation catalyzed by LlNDT or PNP occurs at the N1 position of the imidazole ring. Importantly, enzymatic glycosylation of the tricyclic base 5 into the deoxy\u2010 and ribonucleoside 5 a and 5 d should provide a simple and efficient chemoenzymatic access to the target distal deoxy\u2010 and ribo\u2010inosine fleximers, thereby overcoming the tedious and low\u2010yielding approach that has been used to date.",
