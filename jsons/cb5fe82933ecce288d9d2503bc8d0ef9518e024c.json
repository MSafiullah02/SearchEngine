Rapid testing protocols also ensure the optimal use of isolation room and other facilities at the hospitals. Through widely available testing and contact tracing, followed by isolation and quarantining, this will be a part of the strategy of breaking the transmission chains.

Many provinces in China made it mandatory by law to wear a facemask in public during COVID-19. In contrast, citizens are advised to wear facemask only when they are ill in most non-Asian countries. Some opposing parties believe that the limited supply of facemask should be reserved for healthcare workers. This has led to racial stigmatism and aggravation among mask wearers in some of the countries in the current pandemic. As a public health intervention, mass masking protects the wearer but also each 5 other, and would eliminate discrimination. There is limited evidence, but not evidence of absence, on whether mask masking is effective in protection against coronavirus infection. 6 An adequate supply of medical masks to the public is likely to be a key bottleneck that determines whether such a strategy could be implemented as one of the non-pharmaceutical interventions in a country.",

If relying on social responsibility for voluntary quarantine is unsuccessful, state-issued quarantine orders should be enforced. The lockdown of 11 million residents with closure of all transportations (urban public transport, subway, ferry, and airport) in and out of Wuhan is the largest quarantine in history. Close contacts were quarantined at home or indesignated quarantine facilities. All school and commercial facilities are closed except those related to essential daily supplies and infection control utilities. Rewards were offered to those reporting violators. Community volunteers were organized to support the needs of those under quarantine. The time-varying effective reproduction number (R t ) in Wuhan declined from 2.35 to 1.05 in late January 2020 which coincided with the introduction of these interventions. 2 While the freedom to travel domestically is protected by the constitutional rights in western countries, these are not absolute when it puts the State at risk, particularly at the time of the pandemic. A combination of isolation, social distancing of the entire population, and either household quarantine or school closure are required to reduce the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) to \u22641; where all 4 interventions combined would have the greatest effect. 3 Cordon sanitaire is a continuum of social distancing and should only be considered if there are no other less restrictive alternatives. Due to political and economic factors, the willingness of the citizens to receive such draconian measures would vary from country to country.4",
