            "text": "The later stage of twentieth century witnessed an alarming spread of Tuberculosis (TB) across the European nations, and this sparked an extensive research in the field of infection control techniques [1]. This led to development in the field of infection suppression in order to reduce the spread of disease. A logical solution to the problem was isolation of the infected patient. Deadlier threats like AIDS, bioterrorism (anthrax attacks, Tokyo Metro Sarin Gas attack etc.) and SARS have triggered many concerns about the control of the indoor environment and unveiled the role of ventilation system design in isolating an infected or vulnerable patient [2]. More recent global outbreaks like swine flu, bird flu and Ebola virus have shown that even though we have advanced technologically, there is still a lot left to be done in the field of contaminant suppression [3].",

            "text": "Medical facilities are places where relatively high levels of pathogenic (disease-causing) micro-organisms are generated and concentrated by an infected patient population or by procedures that handle infected human tissues and bodily fluids. These pathogens are spread by a number of contact and noncontact (airborne) causes. Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs, also referred to as nosocomial infections) have a significant impact on patient care. Mortality rates from HAIs are significant and affect the overall cost of healthcare delivery. It is agreed that 80\u201390% of HAIs are transmitted by direct contact, with 10\u201320% resulting from an airborne transmission (representing 0.4\u20131% of admitted patients) [4]. It is, therefore, imperative that we take a closer look at the design of healthcare facilities with respect to suppression of contaminants while at the same time providing patient comfort to ensure that the patient does not get worse after admission and leaves the facility healthy. For achieving this goal, the design of the heating, ventilation and cooling (herein referred to as HVAC) system of a healthcare facility is important and has to be economically viable. The term is often used interchangeably with the more common \u2018air conditioning\u2019. The term air conditioning refers to a system that controls temperature, moisture in the air (humidity), supply of outside air for ventilation, filtration of airborne particles, and air movement in the occupied space. HVAC systems in healthcare facilities provide a broad range of services in support of populations who are uniquely vulnerable to an elevated risk of health, fire and safety hazard. The role of the HVAC system in life safety and infection control becomes more important with increasing complexity of the medical services provided and the acuity of illness of the patient population [5].",

            "text": "Isolation refers to the separation of a seriously ill patient to stop the spread of infection or protect the patient from irritating factors. A patient known or suspected to harbour transmissible micro-organisms should be placed in a single room. A single room with appropriate air handling and ventilation is particularly important for reducing the risk of airborne transmission of micro-organisms from a source patient to susceptible patients and other persons in hospitals. Airborne transmission is just one of the means by which nosocomial infection spreads. Other modes of infection include contact, droplet, common vehicle and vector-borne. An isolation room is designed and provided with all the facilities that are required to ensure protection from all the above-mentioned modes of transmission of infectious microbes. Standard isolation rooms have a pan sanitizer near the room, a staff hand-wash basin within the room, an en suite bathroom, a self-closing door, a label as a standard isolation room. The most predominant mode of infection communication, i.e. airborne transmission is taken care of by an appropriate HVAC system. Broadly speaking, there are two classes of isolation rooms: Class N\u2014negative pressure room and Class P\u2014positive pressure room [6]. Negative pressure rooms are for patients who are suffering from infectious or contagious diseases like TB and SARS. The aim of placing infected persons in negative pressure rooms is to reduce transmission of disease via the airborne route. Conroy et al. [7] came up with a list of features, which should exist in a negative pressure room to effectively isolate the patient. Positive pressure rooms are installed in certain facilities to isolate profoundly immune-compromised patients, such as those suffering from AIDS. A lot of research has hence been focussed towards the design of isolation wards with respect to ventilation strategy for contaminant suppression and patient comfort.",

As per healthcare guidelines [8, 9], ventilation strategy in an isolation room should be such that there are no stagnant and under-ventilated areas where infectious particles might be accumulated. In addition, healthcare providers subjected to an uncomfortable environment may not function at peak performance levels [5]. A study [8] of isolated patients concluded that healthcare workers visited patients in contact isolation less often than they visited regular patients, which might compromise patient safety and healthcare quality. Keeping this in mind, a proper ventilation strategy must be devised which provides for infection control and mitigation, comfort of both patients and healthcare providers, and efficient power consumption.",

            "text": "As such, there are many challenges to overcome in the design of an efficient HVAC system for contaminant suppression. The initial design problem of an isolation room is to fix a location of the supply and exhaust vents inside the isolation room. Cheong and Phua [10] proposed a ventilation strategy for effective removal of pollutant from hospital isolation wards and inferred that a low-lying exhaust together with a ceiling supply duct delivering laminar air was the best combination. The role of air changes per hour (ACH) in order to reduce the effective residence time of contaminant was also of prime research interest. Memarzadeh and Xu [11] investigated the role of air changes per hour in possible transmission of airborne infections by simulating various ventilation system configurations and concluded that the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust, and not the airflow ventilation rate as was expected. This observation was also corroborated experimentally by Mousavi and Grosskopf [12] and Walker et al. [13]. More in-depth studies on the path of a contaminant inside an isolation ward and its response to various strategies have been carried out. Tung et al. [14] carried out a study on contaminant (sulphur hexafluoride, SF6) dispersion inside isolation room by varying the room negative pressure (from \u22122.5 to \u221215.0 Pa), the ventilation rates (12 and 24 h\u22121), by factoring in the local air quality index, and the exposure index of hospital workers. Derakshan and Shaker [15], in an attempt to reduce energy consumption by increasing the efficiency of natural ventilation, investigated volumetric flow rate in a building for various aspect ratios of the windows and their locations for various wind directions. Wan et al. [16] proposed a new method for selecting optimum indoor temperature and relative humidity to achieve minimum energy consumption for a required indoor thermal comfort level, which is evaluated with effective temperature. The research into contaminant suppression can be further extended to general hospital wards in order to reduce HAIs. Beggs et al. [17] conducted research into the need of ventilation system inside general multi-bed hospital wards. They found that bio-aerosol concentration was least when the supply and exhaust were ceiling mounted as opposed to other strategies.",

A three-dimensional k-\u03b5 turbulence model using a finite difference code (UNIC), which was developed by Engineering Science Inc., USA, was adopted in this work. The numerical simulation was first adopted to predict the airflow patterns and ventilation performance and later, a laboratory experiment at room air and contaminant distribution in a full-scale test chamber was conducted to validate the simulation results. The results indicated that the location of inlet and outlet diffusers severely affected the ventilation efficiency. The arrangement of inlet/outlet diffusers can cause different flow recirculation patterns, and this may change the mean age of indoor contaminant, thus deciding how quickly the indoor contaminant can be removed. Yu et al. [19] conducted a study on ventilation strategies for hospitals to mitigate the risk of infections. They studied the effects of location of infected patients and air change per hour to minimize deposition and floating time of airborne virus particles while maximizing energy efficiency. Although there is a plethora of research [7\u201315, 17, 18, 20\u201323] on making contaminant removal systems efficient and optimizing power consumption in buildings, a comprehensive research that amalgamates effective ventilation systems with infection control in isolation wards of hospitals has a long way to go.",

In this method, the physical domain is subdivided into a number of contiguous control volumes on an unstructured tetrahedral grid, as shown in Fig. 3. Unstructured tetrahedral grids are constructed by dividing the computational domain into small cells that have a tetrahedral shape. The strength of this type of grid lies in its flexibility for handling very complex geometries. A commercial software package (ICEMCFD) was used to generate meshes. The generated mesh was made very fine near the patient body (0.01 m) and coarse towards the isolation room walls (0.2 m). A refined mesh was also generated at the air supply inlet and the exhaust. To effectively capture the air flow around the patient body, a mesh density box was generated with elements of size 0.025 m as can be seen from Fig. 3b. Equations (1\u20138) were discretized using FVM Techniques. Convective term is discretized using hybrid upwind scheme. The diffusion terms are discretized using second-order central difference. Weighted average of surrounding cell-centred properties is used for determining nodal quantities. SIMPLE like algorithm is used for handling pressure velocity decoupling. Collocated grid arrangement is applied, and movement interpolation is used to determine the face flux of each cells. System of algebraic equation is solved using BICGStab.",

It can be observed that the recirculation zones above and below the bed have decreased and stagnation zones have formed. This ventilation strategy as such is not recommended for an immune-suppressed patient because he might start complaining about draught sensation. Placing an infectious patient in the room is not recommended as well due to significant stagnation zones that exist inside the room. Another recirculation zone is formed above the jet, as can be seen from Fig. 8a, and this could possibly lead to a stagnation zone above the jet further deteriorating the ventilation of the room. These effects can be linked to the short-circuiting of the airflow due to reduced vent height. The temperature inside the room is more evenly distributed than in the previous case.\n",

It offers better control over the HVAC and ventilation parameters due to the multiple inlet vents.In this study, many simplifications/assumptions were taken that render our results only approximate.
