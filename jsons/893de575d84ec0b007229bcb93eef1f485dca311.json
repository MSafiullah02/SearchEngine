            "text": "Some recommendations have been suggested in the case of IBD patients in COVID-19 epidemic areas[39]. As IBD patients taking immunosuppressants should be considered as being at potentially high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (particularly if they are in an active stage of the disease, malnourished, elderly, or have co-morbidities such as hypertension or diabetes), specific care should be taken to implement preventive strategies, including the avoidance of jobs at higher risk of transmission the restriction of social activities, and limitations on hospital medical examinations.Patients can continue their treatment if they are in a stable condition. Expert opinion suggests continuing the use of immunosuppressants, particularly thiopurines and biological agents, because any interruption may be associated with an increased risk of recurrence. This may involve therapeutic measures that also prevent hospitalisation and, in some cases, even the possibility of surgery because these are conditions that increase the risk of infectious complications, including It is also worth remembering that, even if they are discontinued, these drugs continue to have effects for some weeks.Biological drugs (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) should not be discontinued for the same reasons as those indicated above, although it may be necessary to favour domiciliary treatment with adalimumab injections if infliximab infusions are not accessible[39]. It is generally not recommended to change treatments or increase the doses of immunosuppressants in epidemic areas unless it is really necessary, but temporary discontinuation can be considered provided that the risk of relapse is taken into account [39]. If it is suspected that a patient receiving immunosuppressive or biological treated is undergoing a relapse with fever and needs to be seen as outpatient, treatment should be discontinued if COVID-19 cannot be ruled out. Patients with biological agents who are at low risk of relapse, such as those in long-term and stable clinical remission, can postpone the infusion, although those at high risk should continue. It is also necessary to remember that, although the risk of a relapse of CD and UC during the first year after the withdrawal of a biological drug or immunosuppressant is 20-50%, it is less for shorter periods of discontinuation (albeit unpredictably so), which means that the risk needs to be assessed before postponing an infusion. In the absence of precise and objective diagnostic instruments that can help decision making (e.g. an endoscopic evaluation of mucosal healing), it is possible to rely on calprotectin or CRP levels. Finally, the factors favouring a reduced risk of relapse are immunomodulatory co-treatment, the absence of complex perianal or severe rectal disease, no history of intestinal or colonic stricture, intra-abdominal abscesses or fistulae, and a limited extent of the disease in the past[40]. In the absence of these, it is wiser not to stop biological treatment.",

Depending on studies a different therapeutic regimen is suggested [50]. The Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical disease (Lombardy section) recommend the use of 500 mg of chloroquine twice a day for ten days, or 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg per day[3][. However, we would like to point out that, although studies of antimalarials and COVID-19 are promising and have a mechanistic justification, data and controlled studies to support the use of anti-malarial for COVID-19 patients, are still lacking [51,52].Unjustified tweets come from politicians like President Trump that have emphasized the use of these drugs as: \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\", have led to a current shortage of HCQ for our rheumatic patients. Another raising question if as whether these drugs can be used to prevent COVID-19. Given the lack of scientific evidence, the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT) has pronounced against this possibility[3] and we believe that, even though they have a good safety profile, it is necessary to evaluate them further in clinical trials.",
