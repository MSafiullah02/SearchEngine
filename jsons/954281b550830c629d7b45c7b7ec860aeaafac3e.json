Seven tweets (5 %) suggested that the WHO has collaborated with the gaming industry on this campaign. The tweets that did not suggest WHO joining the gaming industry on the campaign were liked and retweeted significantly more as compared to the ones that suggested such a collaboration (p = 0.001 and 0.026, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Thirteen tweets (9.2 %) suggested either a possibility of consideration of discontinuation of gaming disorder or WHO finding some benefit in gaming. The tweets that did not suggest discontinuation of gaming disorder as a diagnostic category were liked significantly more than the other tweets (p = 0.023, Mann-Whitney U test). Interestingly, around fifty percent (73 tweets) of the tweets encouraged physical distancing and supported the WHO for its efforts. However, the retweets were comparable irrespective of this message (p-value > 0.05). Fifty-six tweets (39.7 %) carried a promotional message for a game or a gaming console or device. Finally, tweets that suggested partnership of the account holder with WHO to encourage or support #PlayApartTogether were liked and retweeted significantly more than the other tweets (p = .002 and .002, respectively on Mann-Whitney U test).",
