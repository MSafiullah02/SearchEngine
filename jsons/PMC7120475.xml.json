These simple instruments were constructed so as to trap air in glass tubes with the open end of the tube submersed in a reservoir of water. These open thermometers were termed thermoscopes. In 1610, Galileo used wine instead of water and was one of the first to use an alcohol thermometer. It was, of course, found that when carrying such a device up a mountain to a different altitude that the level in the tube was affected by the changing atmospheric pressure. These devices illustrated changes in sensible heat, before the concept of temperature had been recognized. While it is sometimes claimed that Galileo was the inventor of the thermometer, what he actually produced was a thermoscope. He did discover that glass spheres filled with aqueous alcohol of different densities would rise and fall with changing temperature. Today, this is the principle of the Galilean thermometer, which is calibrated with a temperature scale.",

At the end of the sealed tube, he had a bulb blown of the optimal size to be inserted in the mouth. The open end was submersed in fluid. As the air expanded due to the oral temperature, fluid was expelled from the tube. After a fixed period of time, the bulb was removed, the air cooled, causing the fluid to rise in the calibrated tube (Fig. 3.1) [1].",

This was the first thermometer to depend on the expansion and contraction of a liquid, which was independent of barometric pressure. Many variants of this concept appeared, each unique as there was no standard scale. Christian Huygens in 1665 suggested using the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water as standards. The Danish astronomer Ole R\u00f8mer in Copenhagen used these upper and lower limits for a thermometer that he used to record the weather. There was still uncertainty about how well these parameters would work at different geographical latitudes. In 1694, Carlo Renaldini suggested that the ice and boiling water limits should be adopted as a universal scale. In England, Isaac Newton proposed in 1701 that a scale of 12 \u00b0C could be used between melting ice and body temperature!",

He manufactured high-quality thermometers with mercury (which has a high coefficient of expansion) with an inscribed scale with greater reproducibility. It was this that led to their general adoption. Fahrenheit first calibrated his thermometer with ice and sea salt as zero. Salt water has a much lower freezing point than ordinary water, so he chose the freezing point as 30 \u00b0F. The temperature inside the healthy human mouth was 96 \u00b0F, and he established the boiling point of water at 212 \u00b0F. He later adjusted his freezing point to 32 \u00b0F, so he established 180 \u00b0F between boiling and freezing which he measured at sea level [2].",

He may have already at that early stage in his career realized that there was a need for a common international scale. He was appointed as professor of astronomy at Uppsala (as his father had been before him) and was involved in meteorological surveys. Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments leading to the establishment of an international temperature scale based on scientific data. (He was for many years secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences at Uppsala.) His paper \u2018Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer\u2019 described his detailed experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude and atmospheric pressure. He also determined the dependence of boiling water on atmospheric pressure and gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a standard pressure [3].",

No single person was given credit. A century later, Carl August Wunderlich stated in the English translation of his treatise on \u2018Temperature in Diseases\u2019 that he preferred to retain all his measurements in the centigrade scale, because the convenience of this scale will probably shortly lead to its general adoption by all scientific men. Celsius is now internationally recognized for his major contribution through his careful experiments and in using fixed points for calibration. This was recognized by the adoption in 1948 by an international conference on weights and measures of the preferred scale for temperature now referred to as degree Celsius (\u00b0C).

By 1863, John Davy had noted the variations in temperature resulting from exercise, the intake of food and drink, the influence of external temperature, and the differences in body processes in children.

His treatise was based on regular temperature measurements made on all his patients over the course of 15 years, some as many as four to six times daily. After some 100,000 observations, Wunderlich showed that when the temperatures were plotted on charts, the disease could be shown to follow certain laws, which could be characterized by the trend in temperature. Overall, he studied some 25,000 specific cases. This was clearly a significant contribution to the subject and places Wunderlich at the forefront of discovery in this aspect of clinical observation. He had established that the temperature in a healthy person is constant and that variation of temperature occurs in disease. From this, Wunderlich laid down a code based on principles that he had derived from his large set of observations.

Here are some examples:The temperature of healthy person is almost constantly the same, although not absolutely. So, indeed there are spontaneous variations in the course of every twenty-four hours, but these seldom exceed half a degree of the centigrade scale.A normal temperature does not necessarily indicate health, but all those whose temperature either exceeds or falls short of the normal range are unhealthy.The range of temperature in the most severe diseases is between 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and 42.5 \u00b0C (108.5 \u00b0F), and it is very seldom that it exceeds 43 \u00b0C (109.4 \u00b0F) or sinks below 33 \u00b0C (91.4 \u00b0F).Alterations of temperature may be confined to special regions of the body, which are the seat of disease actions (local inflammation), while the general temperature remains more or less normal.A rapid increase in temperature of the body from a chill, or in the normal warmth of the hands, feet, nose, or forehead, is commonly associated with strong feelings of chilliness and convulsive movements (\u2018cold shivers\u2019, rigors, \u2018fever-frost\u2019).A more or less permanent and noticeable rise in temperature amounting to 38.5 \u00b0C (101.3 \u00b0F) or more, is generally accompanied with subjective feelings of heat, and lassitude, as well as with thirst and headache\u2026and rapidity of the pulse \u2026(\u2018feverishness\u2019, pyrexia, fever).When there are extremes of temperature, we know that there is great danger. High fever is indicated by temperatures above 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) in the morning, and above 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) in the evening.Temperatures in every known disease except relapsing fever, in all probability, indicate a fatal termination (42 \u00b0C [107.6 \u00b0F] or more-hyperpyretic temperatures).Abnormally low temperatures may seriously disturb the various functions of the body; and when the fall is very considerable, it may render the continuation of life impossible [8].",

He also discusses the various sites on the human body where thermometry may be applied. Of the many potential areas, he showed that in the hand or between fingers and toes was too unreliable. Rectal and vaginal sites were also criticized, the former being affected by masses of faeces, and the latter lacking in clinical evidence of reliability. The axilla and the mouth were advocated, with warnings of the effects of ingestion of food and drink, and or oral breathing when suffering from nasal congestion.",

A local company, Harvey and Reynolds, first manufactured this special thermometer in 1867, followed by Thackeray in London. Allbutt made the design of his thermometer freely available to others, and it was quickly taken up by British physicians. It was notable in that the instrument, 15 centimetres long, had a constriction in the capillary tube that held the mercury at its reading after use, until shaken down to the lower limit of calibration (Fig. 3.3).",

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, this technology came into practical use, accelerated by the needs of the military during the Second World War. In the late 1950s, once infrared technology had been declassified, thermal imaging became available to medicine and industry. Although the early systems were slow scanners, it became clear that it was possible to record the temperature distribution of a human subject or an object. An important conference in 1964 at the New York Academy of Sciences revealed the true potential of this technology in the study of human body temperature [11].",

In contrast to the very expensive early thermal imaging systems, this device promised a low cost and reliable means of measuring temperature close to the brain, but without the invasive contact of thermocouples. Initially only used for military and space technology, the tympanic radiometer came into medicine some 30 years later. This was undoubtedly stimulated by the concerns about the use of mercury on thermometers and its subsequent banning. The radiometer was further developed in the United States for measuring temperature over the temporal artery and was also used to measure forehead temperature. The latter application is not always successful, as the forehead may be a site of profuse sweating, either from physical exertion or from fever.",
