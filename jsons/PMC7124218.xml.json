In the midst of an outbreak of SARS, this event was ominous in a hospital that had no previous SARS cases and it was classified as a possible SARS outbreak. The source was unknown but we assumed that all patients in both wards had been exposed to the virus. A later epidemiological study using contact tracing pointed to an index case having infected a total of 24 HCWs, patients (excluding those in the study cohort) and visitors in the two wards. In view of the speed of the outbreak and the potential for spread to the rest of the 1400 bed general hospital, the SARS taskforce in the hospital together with the Ministry of Health (MOH) decided to isolate the entire cohort of patients on the two wards.",

The patients were triaged on admission to the wards. Those requiring close hourly monitoring, invasive central venous pressure monitoring and tracheostomy care were admitted to the high-dependency ward (ward C). The less seriously ill were admitted to the general wards. These patients were triaged accordingly: ward A, those who had a current fever or a recent history of fever related to a surgical cause (e.g. surgical infections and postoperative complications); and ward B, those who had no history of fever in their admission before transfer and included patients with chronic surgical problems. The wards were of an open design and patients were subject to cohorting. Limited numbers of isolation rooms were available on the general wards and in the high-dependency ward. No visitors were allowed and there was no interaction of patients between wards. Patients were discouraged from interacting with one another within the ward, but as their condition improved, many, in fact, did so. They shared facilities within the ward such as the toilets and bathing facilities. The HCWs looking after them wore full personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times using precautions for airborne, droplet and contact transmission. The PPE included 3M (1860/1860S) N95 particulate respirator masks, long-sleeved disposable gowns, goggles or visors, hair covers and gloves. The technique of applying and removing the PPE was standardized for all HCWs. The N95 masks were test fitted for all HCWs before patient contact. Gowns and gloves were discarded after each patient contact and strict handwashing was observed. Contaminated goggles and stethoscopes were cleaned with 70% alcohol before re-use as was other equipment necessary for routine physical examination. The use of PAPR (powered airway pressure respirators, 3M Jupiter) was indicated for procedures involving aerosolization such as suctioning and chest physiotherapy. The use of nebulizers in the general ward was prohibited. Surgical procedures were carried out in a specially designated operating theatre.",

The entire cohort was deemed not to have SARS at the onset of quarantine. Subsequently, patients were classified into four groups: (1) non-SARS; (2) observation for unexplained fever (temperature >38 \u00b0C); (3) suspected SARS; and (4) probable SARS. Case definition of suspected and probable SARS status was according to prevailing guidelines at the time of the outbreak.9., 10. Patients were followed up daily and clinical parameters monitored at least three times per day. A fever >38 \u00b0C or development of symptoms suspicious for SARS prompted a detailed clinical review and a possible upgrading of SARS status. Patients who were upgraded to an observation, suspected or probable SARS status were subsequently removed from the cohort and placed in isolation in a different part of the hospital.

No post-mortem examination or biological confirmation of SARS infection was carried out. The sixth mortality (patient 46) occurred in a probable SARS patient who was a 74-year-old man admitted for intestinal obstruction secondary to adhesions.

The role of triaging and cohorting as a public health measure in the management of a large number of exposed institutionalized individuals in a SARS outbreak have not been investigated or reported previously. With such measures, the clinical incidence rate was 10% (7/70) with one SARS-related mortality. There was no transmission within the cohort.

This experience differs from some previous reports where up to 78% had chest radiographic changes at initial presentation.11 This difference is because temperature and symptom monitoring allowed us to identify SARS early before manifestation of radiological changes. The predominant symptom of unexplained fever, or fever followed by the onset of respiratory symptoms, should serve to heighten the suspicion of a possible SARS infection, especially in the light of contact with SARS patients.",

Unlike in the community where exposed individuals are usually clinically well, the cohort had underlying co-morbidities and surgical diseases that may mask the symptoms of SARS. More than 50% had also recently undergone a surgical procedure with postoperative complications in the chest or wound complications that produce symptoms and signs that mimic SARS. In the high-dependency ward, no cases of SARS were seen. These patients were the most ill but they were also the least mobile and the most closely monitored. Suspected cases, if any, could have been easily identified and isolated. In ward A, nine cases were suspected and six were eventually classified as probable SARS. The patients triaged and cohorted here had a history of fever related to an infective surgical condition or post-surgical complication. However, they were also less closely monitored compared with those in the high-dependency ward and more mobile around the ward. Three patients (patients 42, 46 and 52) in this ward were identified and isolated early after the quarantine [Figure 1(b)]. In the other three patients (patient 47, 49 and 55) with probable SARS, the original surgical admission was for infective conditions of the biliary and urinary systems. These patients were subsequently identified when their fever recurred despite adequate treatment of their infective condition. This could have masked and delayed identification of the SARS symptoms. This remains a limiting factor if clinical criteria are used for diagnosis. Long incubation periods of up to 16 days after exposure have also been documented and this accounts for their presentation of symptoms after the first week of quarantine.11., 13., 14. Correspondingly in ward B, only one probable SARS case was identified. Although patients were also mobile and less closely monitored, their principal surgical condition made identification and isolation of the fever and symptoms suspicious for SARS easier.",
