Providers who work on the \u201cfront-lines\u201d as first-responders or in the emergency department, as well as in hospital wards, the intensive care unit, or the outpatient setting, need to implement a variety of mechanisms to help curb the spread of this viral pandemic.",

Other coronaviruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and SARS-CoV-1, have been reported to remain viable on inanimate surfaces such as glass, plastic or metal for up to nine days, but can be inactivated by alcohol solutions, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hypochlorite.6\n,\n7\n",

Furthermore, \u201ccommunity\u201d stethoscopes used by multiple individuals and sharing of stethoscopes should be avoided, if possible, in the midst of this pandemic in order to prevent nosocomial spread and potential self-inoculation.
