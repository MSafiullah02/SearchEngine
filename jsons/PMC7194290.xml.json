            "text": "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus with a linear single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA genome of approximately 11,000 nucleotides. The IHNV genome encodes a non\u2010virion protein (NV) and five structural proteins including nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase protein (L) (Kurath, Ahern, Pearson & Leong 1985; Morzunov, Winton & Nichol 1995). IHNV causes an acute disease in wild and hatchery\u2010reared salmonid fish in North America, Europe and Asia (Wolf 1988; Bootland & Leong 1999). Phylogenetic analysis of IHNV glycoprotein (G) sequences differentiated North American IHNV isolates into three genogroups, denoted as U, M and L (Kurath, Garver, Troyer, Emmenegger, Einer\u2010Jensen & Anderson 2003). There are general host preferences associated with the U and M genogroups. Most of the U genogroup viruses were isolated from sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum), and the M genogroup viruses were mostly from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) (Kurath et al. 2003). In addition, the U and M genogroup viruses show host\u2010specific virulence in vivo (LaPatra, Fryer & Rohovec 1993; Garver, Batts & Kurath 2006). While the U genogroup viruses are highly virulent to sockeye salmon but not rainbow trout, the M genogroup viruses are highly virulent to rainbow trout and not to sockeye salmon. Detailed studies comparing U\u2010 and M\u2010type strain virus infections in rainbow trout (Pe\u00f1aranda, Purcell & Kurath 2009) and sockeye salmon (Purcell, Garver, Conway, Elliott & Kurath 2009) revealed that in each host, higher virulence was associated with more rapid virus replication to higher viral load and persistence, despite a strong host innate interferon (IFN1) response. However, the molecular basis for the host\u2010specific virulence difference of the U and M genogroups is not known.",

            "text": "Based on numerous observations from phylogenetic studies and historical literature on IHNV (Kurath et al. 2003), we have previously hypothesized that the U genogroup in sockeye salmon represents the ancestral IHNV host\u2013virus association, and the M genogroup arose following a host jump into rainbow trout. A viral pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a novel host. It must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors and evade inhibitory host products (Webby, Hoffmann & Webster 2004). Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen. Entry of a virus particle into a cell is initially mediated by the interaction of a virus protein with its corresponding host cell receptors. Different viruses use various host molecules as receptors, some of which are more globally conserved than others. For example, arenaviruses, the causative agents of several haemorrhagic fevers, use the widely conserved \u03b1\u2010dystroglycan protein as a receptor (Meyer, de la Torre & Southern 2002). Coronaviruses, by contrast, generally show a restricted host range that is mediated by specific interaction of the viral spike protein with glycoproteins on the host cell surface (Holmes, Zelus, Schickli & Weiss 2001). For rhabdoviruses, the viral G protein is the only viral protein on the external surface of virions, and it mediates attachment to cellular receptors. In the well\u2010studied mammalian rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), two major serotypes, New Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV), have been described based on neutralizing antibodies to the surface glycoprotein (G) (Cartwright & Brown 1972), and these serotypes differ in virulence for swine (Bridges, McCluskey, Salman, Hurd & Dick 1997). By using recombinant VSV viruses that differed only in their G genes, Martinez, Rodriguez, Jimenez, Pauszek & Wertz (2003) demonstrated that the G protein was a determinant of VSV virulence in this natural host.",

            "text": "Once inside a cell, the virus has to produce copies of its genome and virion components. With the exception of some larger DNA viruses, most viruses with limited coding capacity have to rely on host functions for virus replication. Within host cells, VSV transcribes viral mRNAs and replicates viral RNA genomes by using an RNA polymerase complex consisting of the viral L, P (Emerson & Yu 1975) and N proteins (Qanungo, Shaji, Mathur & Banerjee 2004). It is reported that phosphorylation of the VSV P protein by a host casein kinase II (CKII) is required for regulating RNA synthesis (Barik & Banerjee 1992) and that mutations altering the phosphorylation of the P protein affect RNA transcription or RNA genome replication (Das & Pattnaik 2004). Besides CKII, protein kinase B (PKB) is reported to play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis of non\u2010segmented negative\u2010stranded RNA viruses by phosphorylation of P protein (Sun, Fuentes, Timani, Sun, Murphy, Lin, August, Teng & He 2008).",

            "text": "Virus\u2010infected cells synthesize and secrete type I interferons (IFNs), which are considered the first line of host defence against virus infection (Garcia\u2010Sastre & Biron 2006; Haller, Kochs & Weber 2006; Sadler & Williams 2008). Secreted IFNs stimulate susceptible cells to express more than 300 IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs), whose concerted action leads to limiting further viral growth and spread (Biron & Sen 2001; Sadler & Williams 2008). The myxovirus resistance gene Mx, the PKR protein kinase stimulated by dsRNA and the 2\u2032\u20105\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) are among the best characterized ISGs with antiviral activity (Biron & Sen 2001). Viruses would not replicate successfully in a host if they had not evolved efficient escape strategies allowing them to evade the host IFN response. It is becoming increasingly clear that IFN antagonistic properties can determine viral virulence in a given host (Webby et al. 2004). Strategies used by viruses to suppress IFN production, to down\u2010modulate IFN signalling and to block the action of antiviral effector proteins have been reported (Haller et al. 2006; Haller, Kochs & Weber 2007). In the case of VSV, virally produced dsRNA plays a crucial role in inducing an antiviral state in virus\u2010infected cells (Ostertag, Hoblitzell\u2010Ostertag & Perrault 2007). VSV M protein is reported to suppress the IFN gene expression through inactivation of transcription factor II D (Ahmed, McKenzie, Puckett, Hojnacki, Poliquin & Lyles 2003). However, once IFN signalling establishes an antiviral state, VSV replication is inhibited by IFNs at multiple stages of infection (Trottier, Palian & Reiss 2005). VSV grows readily to high titres in PKR\u2010null cultured cells, which suggest that protein kinase R (PKR) plays a critical role in limiting VSV replication (Balachandran, Roberts, Brown, Truong, Pattnaik, Archer & Barber 2000).",

The growth difference between the U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV viruses was correlated with a difference in viral RNA synthesis in RTG\u20102 cells. In this study, we further investigated the molecular basis for the growth difference between the U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses in RTG\u20102 cells. Our data suggest that a specific host protein kinase is required for IHNV replication, possibly for viral RNA synthesis. We hypothesize that during the adaptation to rainbow trout as a new host, the M genogroup virus developed a requirement for different host protein kinases to achieve optimal growth, and different host protein kinase requirements are at least partially responsible for the different growth of U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells.",

Recombinant viral progeny of the full\u2010length clone pIHNV was designated rIHNV. To generate chimeric recombinant viruses, coding regions (open reading frames, ORFs) of the G and NV genes of the U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV strains were amplified by RT\u2010PCR from RNA extracted from infected EPC cells. RT\u2010PCR was performed with primers as follows: GU: GAGCAGAGGTGAAGACTAGA, GATAAGTAACTTGCCACTGC; GM: CACGTAAAGTACCAGGTCATC, ACACACCCACAGTATCACT; NVU: AGTGAGCAGGAAGACTC, GGTAGGAGCTATGGCGACT; NVM: AGTGAGCAGGAAGACTC, GGTAGGAGCTATGGCGACT. Unique SpeI and SmaI restriction enzyme sites surrounding the G or NV ORFs of pIHNV were created by site\u2010directed mutagenesis with the Quick Change kit (Stratagene). The entire G ORF of pIHNV was deleted by SpeI\u2013SmaI digestion and replaced with amplified DNA fragments containing the GU or GM ORFs to generate pIHNV\u2010GU or pIHNV\u2010GM. Similarly, the entire NV ORF of pIHNV was deleted and replaced with DNA fragments containing the NVU or NVM ORFs to generate pIHNV\u2010NVU or pIHNV\u2010NVM, respectively (Fig. 1a). The presence and position of the inserted genes were confirmed by RT\u2010PCR and restriction enzyme analysis, and sequencing of the inserted sites in the plasmids. Recombinant viruses were recovered from EPC cells as previously described (Biacchesi et al. 2000). Briefly, EPC cells were infected with the vaccinia virus recombinant that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7\u20103) (Fuerst, Niles, Studier & Moss 1986) and transfected with the full\u2010length cDNA clones and three support plasmids that expressed the N, P and L proteins required for RNA encapsidation and replication.

As a control for background levels of luciferase activity induced by IHNV in the supernatant, RTG\u2010P1 cells were incubated for 48 h with supernatant harvested from IHNV\u2010infected EPC cells, which do not appear to have a homologous IFN1 response but support IHNV replication to levels comparable to the RTG\u20102 cells.

            "text": "One of the interesting features of IHNV is that IHNV isolates vary in virulence for different salmonid species (LaPatra et al. 1993); M genogroup viruses isolated from rainbow trout are highly virulent to rainbow trout, but U genogroup viruses isolated from sockeye salmon show low virulence to rainbow trout (Garver et al. 2006). We previously observed that while the M\u2010type strain grows well in rainbow trout\u2010derived RTG\u20102 cells, the growth of U\u2010type IHNV is restricted in the same cells (Park et al. 2010). The purpose of this work was to investigate the basis of the difference in growth between U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells. Several factors suggested the hypothesis that the viral G protein may be responsible for this difference in growth: (1) IHNV genogroups are based on G nucleotide sequences (Kurath et al. 2003); (2) rhabdovirus G protein is responsible for the first steps of infection, attachment and fusion (Matlin, Reggio, Helenius & Simons 1982); (3) G protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of rhabdoviruses including rabies virus and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) (Dietzschold, Wunner, Wiktor, Lopes, Lafon, Smith & Koprowski 1983; Gaudin, de Kinkelin & Benmansour 1999; Ito, Takayama, Yamada, Sugiyama & Minamoto 2001); (4) G protein of the rhabdovirus VSV activates a specific antiviral TLR4\u2010dependent pathway (Georgel, Jiang, Kunz, Janssen, Mols, Hoebe, Bahram, Oldstone & Beutler 2007); and (5) VHSV G induces type 1 interferon expression in neighbouring cells (Acosta, Collet, Lorenzen & Ellis 2006). In this study, to assess a role of G protein in the differential growth of U\u2010 and M\u2010type strains, we generated recombinant IHNVs that expressed the G protein of representative U\u2010 or M\u2010type viruses. Both rIHNVs grew equally well in RTG\u20102 cells, indicating that the growth difference between the U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV in these cells was not a result of differences in G.",

Thoulouze, Bouguyon, Carpentier & Br\u00e9mont (2004) previously reported that although an NV deletion mutant of rIHNV is able to replicate, the NV protein is essential for the efficient growth of IHNV in cell culture and also for pathogenicity in rainbow trout. Although the function of the IHNV NV protein is not clearly understood, it is possible that the NV proteins from the U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses possess different capabilities for down\u2010regulation of the host immune system, leading to their different growth in RTG\u20102 cells. Here, we tested whether NV is responsible for the different growth between U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses in RTG\u20102 cells by using chimeric recombinant IHNVs that express NV of U\u2010type or M\u2010type within the same genomic background. However, the growth of these two recombinant viruses was not significantly different in RTG\u20102 cells, which means that NV does not play a key role in the difference in growth between U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNVs.",

Viruses, in turn, have evolved multiple strategies to block or evade the induction of interferon and also ISGs, which would otherwise suppress virus growth early in infection (Haller et al. 2006). Recently, IFN genes have been identified in a number of species of teleost fish including rainbow trout (Robertsen 2006). To determine whether antiviral activities induced by the IFN system can block the growth of the U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses differently, cells were treated with poly I:C, a dsRNA homologue that induces a strong IFN response in rainbow trout. Poly I:C pretreatment of cells 24 h before infection induced the expression of the IFN and Mx1 genes and blocked the growth of both U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses in RTG\u20102 cells. However, the inhibitory effects of poly I:C pretreatment on the growth of U\u2010 or M\u2010type viruses were different; while the growth of U type was completely blocked by poly I:C pretreatment until 72 h p.i., the M type grew steadily, although more slowly, and reached a titre that was only 10\u2010fold less than that of the untreated control infections at 72 h p.i. Thus, the antiviral activities induced by poly I:C blocked the growth of both U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses at the early stage of virus infection, but the U type was more severely restricted. This suggests that the M type, but not the U type, has some mechanisms to withstand the antiviral activities induced by poly I:C and can continue to grow in IFN1\u2010induced RTG\u20102 cells. This may be reflective of the higher titres reached by M\u2010type virus in the absence of poly I:C stimulation, and/or it could be that the slower growth of the U\u2010type virus allows the host more time to mount an effective antiviral response. After 72 h, the U type began to grow, presumably owing to waning of the strong poly I:C\u2010induced IFN1 response. Eventually, the U type reached a titre equivalent to the M\u2010type virus at 192 h p.i., probably due to extensive cell death in the M\u2010type infections at that time as reported previously (Park et al. 2010).",

If this is true, we would expect the M\u2010type virus to more effectively block the IFN1 response, facilitating its higher growth. However, several lines of evidence showed that the growth restriction of the U type was not caused by induction of a higher level of IFN or ISGs: (1) M\u2010type virus induced more up\u2010regulation of IFN1 and Mx1 gene expression than U\u2010type virus in RTG\u20102 cells; (2) M\u2010type\u2010infected cells produced a higher level of IFN1 activity in cell culture supernatant relative to U\u2010type\u2010infected cells, as indicated using RTG\u2010P1 cells; (3) the PKR inhibitor did not exert any effects on the growth of either the U or M type. These results were somewhat unexpected, as IFNs, Mx and PKR are well known to have antiviral activities and suppress the growth of viruses, including the fish rhabdovirus VHSV (Haller et al. 2006; Tafalla, Sanchez, Lorenzen, DeWitte\u2010Orr & Bols 2008). Our data revealed that poly I:C treatment before virus infection induced a high level of IFN1 and Mx1 and limited production of both U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses. However, when cells were treated with poly I:C after virus infection, there was no effect on the growth of either of theU\u2010or M\u2010type strains. Given that IFN1 is usually induced after virus infection, any effect of the poly I:C treatment post\u2010infection would have been in addition to the IFN1 induced by the viruses themselves. Nevertheless, conventional antiviral activity induced by IFN1 does not appear to be a major factor responsible for the difference in growth between U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses in RTG\u20102 cells.",

            "text": "What then is the factor responsible for the different growth of the U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNVs in RTG\u20102 cells? Previously, we reported that expression levels of viral mRNA and genome RNA of the U\u2010type virus were significantly reduced compared with those of M type in RTG\u20102 cells (Park et al. 2010). Until now, regulation mechanisms of IHNV RNA synthesis have not been well studied. However, work with the mammalian rhabdovirus VSV revealed that viral RNA synthesis is carried out by two RNA polymerase complexes; a complex of the viral L and P proteins for transcription and a complex of viral L, P and N proteins for replication (Gupta, Shaji & Banerjee 2003; Qanungo et al. 2004). Both viral transcription and replication are affected by phosphorylation of viral P protein by host kinases (Barik & Banerjee 1992; Das & Pattnaik 2004; Sun et al. 2008). If P proteins of the U and M genogroups differ in phosphorylation sites and, thus, require different protein kinases for their activation, the growth of U and M strains could be controlled by specific protein kinases of host cells. Using the NetPhosK server (Blom et al. 2004), we predicted differences in five kinase\u2010specific phosphorylation sites in the P proteins of the U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV strains; three PKC, one CKII and one p38MAPK phosphorylation sites. To determine whether any of these protein kinases are important for the differential growth of U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses, RTG\u20102 cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors against these protein kinases and viral growth was analysed. It is not certain whether protein kinase inhibitors used in this study are effective against kinases of RTG\u20102 cells. However, several reports have confirmed the inhibitory effects of protein kinase inhibitors, including the p38MAPK inhibitor used here, in trout and salmon (Lacroix & Hontela 2001; Ebner, Fiechtner, Pelster & Krumschnabel 2006; Hansen & J\u00f8rgensen 2007). This suggests that protein kinase inhibitors are likely to inhibit enzymes in RTG\u20102 cells. We found that the PKC and p38MAPK inhibitors did not exert effects on the growth of either the U or M types, but the CKII inhibitor specifically blocked the growth of the U\u2010type virus. Although we did not determine the phosphorylation of P protein after treatment of inhibitors, the specific block of growth of the U\u2010type suggests that it requires CKII activity for its growth in RTG\u20102 cells, but the M\u2010type may use a different protein kinase than CKII. We therefore hypothesize that P proteins of U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV are phosphorylated by different host protein kinases that have different activities in virus\u2010infected RTG\u20102 cells. This could cause a difference in RNA polymerase activities and result in different growth between U\u2010 and M\u2010types. If this is the case, the observation of equal growth of U\u2010 and M\u2010types IHNV in EPC cells (Park et al. 2010) would suggest that the U\u2010virus P protein is able to interact with an EPC cell kinase that is either not present in RTG\u20102 cells or the RTG\u20102 kinase is sufficiently different from the EPC cell kinase such that it cannot recognize the U\u2010type virus P protein.",

Studies of host innate immune responses showed that even though the growth of both U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV was suppressed by antiviral activities induced by poly I:C, the U\u2010type virus restriction was not caused by the induction of higher levels of IFN1 or ISGs, and the IFN1 system did not appear to be a major determinant of the growth difference. Finally, kinase inhibitor studies showed that a CKII kinase inhibitor significantly reduced the growth ofU\u2010type, but not M\u2010type virus, in RTG\u20102 cells. These data suggest that host protein kinase is required for IHNV replication, possibly for viral RNA synthesis. We hypothesize that during the adaptation to rainbow trout as a new host, the M genogroup viruses developed a requirement for a different host protein kinase(s) to achieve optimal growth, and differences in host protein kinase requirements are at least partially responsible for the differential growth of U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells. At present, it is not known whether the CKII inhibitor blocks the growth of U\u2010type through modulation of viral RNA synthesis and whether CKII activity is IFN1 dependent or not. These possibilities will be examined in future studies.",
