The most pathogenic species is M. haemofelis, which can cause hemolytic anemia [5], [6] in immunocompetent cats. Coinfection of hemoplasmas with other pathogens such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may worsen the severity of the hemoplasma-induced anemia and result in anemia following infection with less pathogenic hemoplasmas such as \u2018Ca. M. haemominutum\u2019, and \u2018Ca. M. turicensis\u2019 [7], [8].",

These are given intramuscularly to anesthetize the animals followed by femoral vein sampling. Approval was granted for the study from the Iran Veterinary Organization since samples were taken as part of a national and international cooperative project for conservation of Persian leopards, supported by the Iranian Department of the Environment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, The Wildlife Conservation Society and Panthera. The sampled animals were kept either in Tehran zoo or in the Tandoureh National Park. Tandoureh National Park has been protected since 1968 and is located in north eastern Iran and is around 355 km2 in size. Signalment data for these wild felids, as well as their origin and current residence are shown in Table 1\n.",

            "text": "This study documents the presence of hemoplasmas in wild felids for the first time in Iran in the Middle East. It is also the first documentation of hemoplasma infection in the endangered Persian leopard species [12]. The prevalence of hemoplasma infection in wild felids has varied in different studies but is not frequently high. In a surveillance study in Brazil on neotropic and exotic felids, 9.2% of 109 felids were hemoplasma positive (all \u2018Ca. M. haemominutum\u2019) [30], whilst in free-ranging Cheetahs in Namibia, only one of 63 Cheetahs was positive [31]. However higher prevalence was reported in another study evaluating a large sample size (275) from worldwide geographical areas where prevalence of 18%, 32% and 20% were found for M. haemofelis, \u2018Ca. M. haemominutum\u2019, and \u2018Ca. M. turicensis\u2019, respectively [9]. In the current study, hemoplasma infection was confirmed in just two of 19 samples (10.5%), although the sample size was small since access to wild felid samples in the Middle East is very limited due to the difficulties in access to hosts and collection of blood. Both \u2018Ca. M. haemominutum\u2019 infected wild felids in the current study were old male Persian leopards, an indigenous species in Iran. This is in agreement with other studies in domestic cats showing that being male and, older, are risk factors for \u2018Ca. M. haemominutum\u2019 infection [27], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Fighting behavior is also regarded as a risk factor for hemoplasma infection [27], [36], [38], although the fighting behavior of the cats sampled was not completely known and leopards (Panthera pardus) are generally not regarded as an aggressive species [39]. However, in the literature there are cases of intraspecific killing among leopards over a kill, territory or cannibalism, so aggression is possible [40], [41]. There are also two reports of intraspecific killing from Persian leopards in Tandoureh in 2007 and 2016 over food and territory (Memarian. I, personal communication).",

In a Japanese study, the identities of the detected hemoplasma sequences was very high, such that it was not possible to assume the origin of M. haemofelis and \u2018Ca. M. turicensis\u2019 from endangered Iriomote cats. In agreement with our findings, previous studies describing feline hemoplasma phylogenetic analysis based on the RNaseP gene revealed similar close relationships between the hemoplasma species of both domestic and wild felids [9], [31], [48].",
