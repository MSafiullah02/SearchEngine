One of the possible mechanisms for this anticancerous activity was delineated by Kim et al. (2011) in a study of skin cancer. In this study isorhamnetin blocked epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced neoplastic cell transformation by suppressing the expression of COX-2 protein. COX-2 is a major inflammatory mediator and exerts pro-tumorigenic activity (M\u00e9ric et al. 2006) . Furthermore it exerted a negative effect on anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of A431 human epithelial carcinoma cell line . Many other evidences support isorhamnetin's role in reducing cell growth and weight and size of tumors (Ma et al. 2007a; Steffen et al. 2008) . Another set of experiments revealed antitumor role of isorhamnetin by inhibition of the cell cycle protein, farnesyl protein transferase (FPTase) (Oh et al. 2005 ). Previously, quercetin was shown to be a potent anticancer agent, but newer studies have signified the increased potential of isorhamnetin an effective anticancer entity. Such isorhamnetin showed elevated levels of cytotoxicity against cancerous cells as compared to quercetin. It induces necrosis and apoptosis in human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116) (Jaramillo et al. 2010) .

These functions were mediated through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-\u03b3) which is known to be involved in promoting tumorigenesis in gastric cancer. The results by Ramachandran et al. provide a strong basis for establishment of combination therapy involving the use of isorhamnetin to reduce the side effects and enhance treatment efficacy for gastric cancer (Ramachandran et al. 2012 ). Hakkinen et al. 1999) , and other dietary plants (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011) . Previously during epidemiological research, it has been observed that these dietary plants also used for human health betterment and during various preclinical and clinical trials have revealed that kaempferol-rich diet overcomes the human malignancy development (Kim et al. 2003) . Many naturally occurring glycosides of kaempferol are extracted from different plants. These glycosides are kaempferitrin (kaempferol 3,7-dirhamnoside) (Vishnu Prasad et al. 2009 ), astragalin (Wei et al. 2011) , afzelin (kaempferol 3-rhamnoside) (Markham et al. 1992 ), kaempferol 7-O-glucoside (Ibrahim et al. 2008) , robinin (kaempferol-3-O-robinoside-7-O-rhamnoside) (March et al. 2004 ), sophoraflavonoloside (kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside) , and trifolin (kaempferol-3-Ogalactoside) (Nowak and Wolbis 2002) . Kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside-7-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside is one of the most bitter-tasting glycoside compounds and has been isolated from the methanolic plants (Gohar et al. 2000; Ragasa et al. 2005) . During the metabolism process by the activity of enzyme transferase, these flavonoid kaempferol compounds can transfer the product of kaempferol and S-adenosyl methionine to kaempferide (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011; Curir et al. 2001) . Kaempferide is defined as 4\u2032-O-methylkaempferol which is also included in chemical flavonoid compound (Curir et al. 2001 ). These isolated flavonoid and chemical compounds have an antimicrobial , antioxidant (Choi et al. 2013 ), anticancer (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011 , neuroprotective (Filomeni et al. 2012) , antidiabetic (Habtemariam 2011) , immunomodulatory , antiosteoporotic, antiestrogenic (Oh et al. 2006) , anxiolytic (Vissiennon et al. 2012) , analgesic (Tsiklauri et al. 2011) , and anti-allergic activities . Therefore naturally occurring plants are usually used as medicinal plants and for pharmaceutical products. The study of immunopharmacological properties of these plants has clearly shown the result to inhibit the cell growth, oxidative low-density lipoprotein (LDLP) suppression, viral inhibition, and reduction of apoptosis and strengthen the immune system . Kaempferol and kaempferide are developed by the metabolic activities of bioactive plants and are agents to treat many disorders . Ginkgo biloba, Moringa oleifera, Equisetum spp., Tilia spp., propolis, and Sophora japonica are the species of medicinal productivity (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011) . For the cure of free radical damages and different infectious diseases, these pharmacokinetics species have often been utilized (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011). It was indicated that kaempferol compound in plants can be used as an agent of chemo-protection (Chen and Chen 2013) . Recently it was observed that hypertension stress that associated with cardiac risks has been suppressed by the consumption of this anticancer compound in tea and broccoli (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011 ). It has been concluded that kaempferol also plays a vital role to overcome the inflammatory response (Choi et al. 2013) . Kaempferol also suppresses the translational activity of particular protein that may help to inhibit the growth of inflammatory lesions (Choi et al. 2013 ). Kaempferol has been isolated from B. pinnatum which is a medicinal herb used as drug for the antimicrobial activity (Tatsimo et al. 2012) . It also inhibits the aggregation of the foam-producing cells, and these foam-producing cells increase the low-density lipoprotein oxidation (Li et al. 2013 ). These naturally occurring compounds are also used to eliminate cholesterol and lipids from macrophages (Li et al. 2013) . Therefore it can reduce the effect of atherosclerotic disorder (Li et al. 2013 ) and toxicity of neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease (Filomeni et al. 2012) . Secondary glycosidic metabolites of kaempferoid have the ability to develop products like kaempferol as anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-glycine (Al-Musayeib et al. 2011). While these metabolites not only target the tumorous cells but are also capable of minimizing the side effects of the combination of both radio-and chemotherapies (Al-Musayeib et al. 2011 ). Productivity of kaempferol and phytochemically active compound kaempferide has a key importance to act as antiestrogenic property (Hung 2004) . Photochemicals inhibit the estrogen and progesterone receptors to control the proliferation of inflammatory cancerous cells (Frigo et al. 2002) . Kaempferide has structural capability to suppress the attack of fungal infections (Curir et al. 2001) . It was hypothesized that kaempferol reduces the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors too. VEGF receptor increases the risk of ovarian cancer; it can be controlled by taking dietary fruits and vegetables having flavonoid products (Luo et al. 2010) . In vivo investigations induced the role of flavonoid kaempferide acting as an antioxidant to treat the liver patients by the use of isoforms such as P450 (Otake and Walle 2002) . Another side in vitro studies show that kaempferide has anti-plasmodium and antimalarial activity against the strains of Plasmodium falciparum (De Monbrison et al. 2006 ). Therefore in this study it was analyzed that naturally occurring flavonol and chemically active compounds can be used as therapeutic agents. These therapeutic products play an important role to save human life and suppress the activity of various infectious diseases with the help of development of these compounds. , anti-osteoporotic, antiestrogenic (Oh et al. 2006) , anxiolytic (Vissiennon et al. 2012) , analgesic (Tsiklauri et al. 2011) , and anti-allergic activities ). Therefore in this study it was analyzed that naturally occurring flavonoid and chemically active compounds can be used as therapeutic agents. These therapeutic products play an important role to save human life and suppress the activity of various infectious diseases with the help of development of these compounds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 510, "text": "(Ramachandran et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 514, "end": 535, "text": "Hakkinen et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 563, "end": 593, "text": "(Calderon-Montano et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 859, "end": 876, "text": "(Kim et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1057, "text": "Prasad et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1089, "text": "(Wei et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1146, "text": "(Markham et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1196, "text": "(Ibrahim et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1268, "text": "(March et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1388, "text": "(Nowak and Wolbis 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1573, "text": "(Gohar et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1593, "text": "Ragasa et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1812, "text": "(Calderon-Montano et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1831, "text": "Curir et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1936, "end": 1954, "text": "(Curir et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2059, "text": "(Choi et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2103, "text": "), anticancer (Calderon-Montano et al. 2011", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2144, "text": "(Filomeni et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2178, "text": "(Habtemariam 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2249, "text": "(Oh et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2287, "text": "(Vissiennon et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2323, "text": "(Tsiklauri et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 2981, "end": 3011, "text": "(Calderon-Montano et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3270, "end": 3290, "text": "(Chen and Chen 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3465, "end": 3494, "text": "(Calderon-Montano et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3598, "end": 3616, "text": "(Choi et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3755, "end": 3772, "text": "(Choi et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3892, "end": 3913, "text": "(Tatsimo et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 4056, "end": 4071, "text": "(Li et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 4178, "end": 4194, "text": "(Li et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 4260, "end": 4275, "text": "(Li et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 4332, "end": 4354, "text": "(Filomeni et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4693, "end": 4717, "text": "(Al-Musayeib et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 4851, "end": 4862, "text": "(Hung 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 4989, "end": 5008, "text": "(Frigo et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 5093, "end": 5112, "text": "(Curir et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 5362, "end": 5379, "text": "(Luo et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 5536, "end": 5558, "text": "(Otake and Walle 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 5704, "end": 5729, "text": "(De Monbrison et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 6085, "end": 6101, "text": "(Oh et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 6115, "end": 6139, "text": "(Vissiennon et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 6152, "end": 6175, "text": "(Tsiklauri et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biological Properties"}, {"text": "Rhamnetin is also one of the chemical O-methylated flavonoid compounds (Ozipek et al. 1994; Yun et al. 2000) .

This transferase enzyme uses S-adenosyl methionine and isorhamnetin to produce S-adenosylhomocysteine and rhamnazin (Khouri et al. 1988) . Basically rhamnazin is known as 3,5-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-methoxychromen-4-one (Khouri et al. 1988) . It is also the naturally occurring 3\u2032,7-dimethylquercetin flavonoid compound (Joe et al. 2010) . Like other naturally occurring chemical compounds, rhamnetin and rhamnazin also have anticancerous Ma et al. 2012) , antioxidant (Pande 2001) , and anti-infectious activities (Ahmed et al. 2001) , etc. The O-methylated flavonoid compounds are chemically methylated on hydroxyl groups. Chemical formation of this methoxy bond is difficult because methoxylation is possible in any position of molecule . So the usage of specific enzyme O-methyltransferase plays an important role which interacts substrate on specific position of molecule (Mattarei et al. 2010) . That enzyme implies the O-methylation on a specific hydroxyl (3-OH) position. Multile hydroxal functional groups greatly contribute towards the therapeutic potential of polyphenols (Mattarei et al. 2010) . In the metabolism these substrate molecules are rapidly being converted into sulfates, glucuronides, and methyl ethers (Biasutto et al. 2007 ; Fig. 1 Core structure of flavonols Mattarei et al. 2010) . The effect of O-methylation depends on the solubility of flavonoids (Mattarei et al. 2010) . In vivo experiments induced that chemical modification of these molecules were to enhance the solubility effect while reduces the metabolic effects to provide the low bioavailability of polyphenols (Biasutto et al. 2007; Manach et al. 2005; Silberberg et al. 2006; Williamson and Manach 2005) . These studies observed the overall survival of polyphenol OHs (Mattarei et al. 2010) . As shown in Fig. 1 , structurally rhamnetin is a monoethyl ether of quercetin while rhamnazin is identified as quercetin dimethyl ether (Martini et al. 2004) . Therapeutic potential could be attributed to functional groups i.e. C-ring of 3\u2032-hydroxyl and 4\u2032-hydroxyl groups contribute towards redox activity (Metodiewa et al. 1999) , while 3-OH act as inhibitor (Sarno et al. 2002) .
