            "text": "Intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) has been shown to function as second messenger and to be associated with activation of different cell types including microglia. Previously, in human focal cerebral infarctions an early expression of macrophage-related protein-8 (MRP8/ S100A8), a member of the Ca 2+ -binding S100-protein family, in microglia has been reported. On the other hand, a delayed activation of microglia was observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). We therefore examined immunohistochemically microglial expression of MRP8 and allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1), identical to microglial response factor-1 (mrf-1) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (iba1) in human brains after TBI and in control brains. Both, MRP8 and AIF-1 are Ca 2+binding peptides which have been associated with microglial activation in experimental models and in human cerebral infarctions. Detection of AIF-1 in controls confirmed constitutive expression of this peptide in a subset of microglial cells. After TBI, the density of AIF-1 + microglia did not increase significantly. Lesional expression of AIF-1 did not significantly differ from other brain regions. Furthermore, following TBI, we found no significant differences in the density of AIF-1 + microglia as compared to controls. Microglial MRP8 expression was not detectable in controls and within the first 3 days post TBI, but increased rapidly after 3 days post TBI, suggesting a subpopulation of microglial cells to be AIF-1 -/MRP8 + . We conclude that the delayed expression of MRP8 and the lack of AIF-1 up-regulation in microglia after TBI is in contrast to ischemic brain lesions and might reflect different activation cascades of microglia.",

            "text": "Calcium (Ca 2+ ) functions as an intracellular second messenger and is associated with activation of many cells, including monocytes [6] and microglia [18, 19] . In these cell types, Ca 2+ responses precede phagocytosis and oxidative burst. It induces the transcription of a number of eukaryotic genes through transcription factors interacting with Ca 2+ response elements [22] . Several Ca 2+ -binding peptides, in particular members of the S100 supergene family such as S100A8 (macrophage-related protein 8, MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) are preferentially expressed in activated microglia ( [13, 16, 20, 23] , for review see [24] ). MRP8 expression has been reported in various inflammatory conditions, including active inflammatory bowel disease [15] , HTLV-I-associated myelopathy [1] , coronavirus-induced demyelination in rats [31] , human cerebral malaria [25] and human focal cerebral ischemia [20] . The allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a polypeptide of 17 kDa that contains a 12-amino acid region, similar to Ca 2+ -binding EF-hand domains [29] . AIF-1 has been detected in cultured rat microglial cells [11] , in rat brain tissue by immunohistochemistry [3] , in chronically rejected rat heart allografts [29] and in human heart transplants [30] . Human and rat amino acid sequences are 98% homologous [2] . AIF-1 is constitutively expressed in lymphatic tissue [2, 11] and is up-regulated in monocytes/ macrophages under various pathological conditions such as chronic rejection of rat and human allografts [29, 30] and in autoimmune lesions [3, 26] . In the central nervous system (CNS) AIF-1 immunoreactivity is restricted to microglial cells [11] . Increasing AIF-1 expression was found to be associated with microglial activation. Following axotomy, increased AIF-1 expression in activated microglia surrounding injured central motor neurons in adult rats has been reported [7, 12, 28] . In acute inflammatory au-tomimune lesions of rat CNS, increased AIF-1 immunoreactivity was detected in microglia [25] .",

Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry for AIF-1 was performed using a recently established monoclonal antibody [25] . In brief, slices were rehydrated and pretreated for 10 min in a microwave oven (600 W) in citrate buffer pH 6.0. Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with 1% H 2 O 2 in methanol (15 min), and normal rabbit serum (1 : 10) was used to block nonspecific binding sites (15 min at room temperature). AIF-1 antibody-containing hybridoma supernatant was applied overnight at 4\u00b0C.

This is in contrast to experimental data following axotomy [7, 12, 28] , in which AIF-1 was reported to be up-regulated in microglial cells surrounding injured central motor neurons and to peak at 7 days post injury [12] in rats. In human cerebral infarctions Postler et al. [21] observed both, an increase in the intensity of immunoreactivity and in the density of AIF-1 + cells, including ramified/amoeboid and round cells. Although in the present study only ramified/amoeboid cells were considered, our data demonstrate a differential expression pattern of microglia following human TBI and cerebral infarction. This observation was supported by the analysis of MRP8-expressing microglia. As previously described by Engel et al. [5] no MRP8 + microglia were seen in the first 3 days post TBI, as in controls, whereas after 3 days the number of MRP8 + microglia increased strikingly in all brain regions examined and remained elevated at all time points investigated (Fig. 4) . Following human cerebral infarctions, in contrast, an early onset of MRP8 expression in microglia was reported that declined within the first days and was no longer detectable by 3 days post infarction [20] .",

Regular AIF-1 immunoreactivity of ramified cells in controls indicated constitutive expression of AIF-1 in a subset of human microglia, which corresponds to the findings of Postler et al. [21] . Following TBI increasing numbers of CD68 + and MRP8 + microglia/macrophages appeared at the lesion. Double immunolabeling showed that only some of the CD68 + or MRP8 + microglia/ macrophages coexpressed AIF-1. Thus, AIF-1 was expressed only in a subset of microglia/macrophages after human TBI.",
