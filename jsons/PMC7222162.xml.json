Sleep is particularly important among patients recovering from critical illness. Unfortunately, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently experience sleep deprivation (reduced quality and/or quantity of sleep compared to healthy subjects) [1, 2]. After reviewing methods for measuring sleep, this review highlights common causes of sleep deprivation in the ICU and its impact on the functioning of major organ systems. While there is a focus on topics pertinent to the neurological ICU (NeuroICU), we note that much of the literature comes from general critical care rather than a neurocritical patient population.",

Portable PSG is feasible in the ICU, but limited by cumbersome and costly equipment and the difficulties in interpretation among the critically ill [4]. Standard staging criteria in these patients have not been shown to reliably distinguish between sleep and wake as the K complexes and sleep spindles that classically characterize stage 2 sleep are often absent [5].

A recent study by Foreman et al. to evaluate sleep in the NeuroICU found that 65% of patient EEG recordings could not be scored, typically due to the lack of a distinguishable posterior dominant rhythm [13]. Using scorable recordings, the authors found that patients spent significantly more time in lighter (N1) than deeper sleep stages as compared to normal values. Moreover, sleep was abnormally distributed across the day\u2013night cycle\u2014similar to findings in critically ill patients without neurological injury. Studies of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [14] and traumatic brain injury (TBI) [15] have also noted grossly abnormal or even absent sleep architecture in the majority of subjects; greater degrees of abnormality correlated with poorer prognosis.",

Actigraphy (which estimates sleep using a motion sensor worn on the wrist or ankle) is a convenient, noninvasive technique that can be used for extended periods of time; however, it likely overestimates sleep in a largely bedridden, sedated population [17]. It may be useful for assessing sleep fragmentation [18, 19]. Originally employed to monitor anesthesia in the operating room, BSI uses a single foam EEG sensor applied to the forehead. The BSI is calculated as a weighted sum of several EEG parameters and is scaled from 0 to 100, with larger values corresponding to a higher likelihood of alertness. BSI monitoring may predict depth of sedation in critically ill patients with brain injury [20], but further research is necessary to demonstrate its correlation with depth of sleep in this population [21].",

Our search yielded only two studies that quantify the number of care events occurring during patient sleep in the ICU. Using PSG and time-synchronized environmental monitoring, Gabor and colleagues found activities occurring approximately eight times per hour of sleep, accounting for just 7% of total arousals and awakenings (68% of sleep disruption events did not have an identifiable cause; 21% were due to sound) [8]. Tamburri et al. found an average of 42.6 interactions per night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.), but did not directly measure sleep via PSG [23]. Nevertheless, patient care activities consistently rank as a major source of sleep disturbance in surveys of ICU survivors, even more so than noise level [5]. Although many patient care activities are unavoidable or temporally fixed, efforts have been proposed to minimize and reschedule as possible to reduce sleep disruption (see \u201cStrategies for Sleep Promotion in the NeuroICU\u201d). Specific to the NeuroICU, hourly neurological assessments (neurochecks) are performed on many patients and are often cited to justify increased nursing needs [24]. In conjunction with neuroimaging surveillance requiring travel off-unit, neurochecks have been demonstrated to impact surgical decision making in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) [25] and severe TBI [26]. The appropriate duration and frequency of these neurochecks for most diagnoses is often at attending provider discretion [26]. Evidence from patients admitted for ICH suggests that the initial 12 h is a period of frequent and prognostically important neurological change [27], while TBI patients appear to be at highest risk of expansion of a traumatic intracerebral hematoma within 24 h from onset [28].",

Environmental light exposure appears to play a smaller role in sleep disruption than patient care activities or noise, and its effect may be mediated by inadequate daytime light exposure [5, 35].",

In general, sedation shares characteristics with sleep (similar receptor and network effects, muscle hypotonia, altered mentation, respiratory depression) but does not produce the full spectrum of restorative benefits found in sleep [36, 37]. Benzodiazepines, while frequently prescribed for insomnia, have actually been found to suppress REM and deeper N3 sleep stages in favor of lighter N2 sleep in healthy individuals [38]. Similarly, opioids have a sedating effect, but decrease total sleep time and time spent in deeper sleep stages [39, 40]. Other sleep-disrupting medications commonly administered to ICU patients include vasopressors [41] and beta-blockers [42] via their impacts on melatonin production; antidepressants [43, 44], which can decrease time spent in REM sleep; continuous intravenous drips and diuretics, which may increase the frequency of toilet visits or require uncomfortable indwelling urinary catheters [16]; and corticosteroids, which reduce REM sleep and increase the incidence of nightmares [45].",

Pain, either related to illness severity or on its own, is associated with poor sleep and increased arousals due to discomfort [55, 56]. In fact, pain causing loss of sleep may trigger an unfortunate feedback loop in which lack of sleep leads to hyperalgesia, which in turn inhibits adequate rest [57].

            "text": "One area that has been thoroughly investigated is that of mechanical ventilation, and the mode most conducive to sleep. Mechanical ventilation can disrupt sleep due to mismatch between patient demand and ventilator supply (inadequate support leading to dyspnea or excessive support leading to apnea). Studies by Parthasarathy et al. [58] and Toublanc et al. [59] found that when compared to assist control ventilation (ACV), pressure support ventilation (PSV) led to episodic hyperventilation with resulting decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide, causing apneic events. However, work by Cabello and colleagues showed no differences in sleep architecture between non-sedated ICU patients on clinically adjusted PSV, automatically adjusted PSV, or ACV. The authors therefore suggested that it is not PSV itself that causes sleep disruption but the specific ventilator settings: They used lower levels of pressure support, standard minute ventilation, and tidal volume across all modes as compared to previous authors in an effort to better mimic physiological conditions [60]. Other studies looking at proportional assist ventilation [61]\u2014in which pressure is applied in proportion to the patient\u2019s own inspiratory effort\u2014and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist\u2014in which pressure is applied in proportion to the electrical activity of the patient\u2019s diaphragm\u2014also find improved sleep quality [62]. Thus, evidence from multiple studies indicates that patient\u2013ventilator mismatch, rather than any given ventilator mode, is most responsible for sleep disruption. However, it can be challenging to find the appropriate settings most reflective of patient physiology, and clinical conditions (e.g., intracranial pressure crises in the setting of hypercarbia) may demand certain ventilator modes. Additionally, when generalizing the results of critical care ventilation studies to neurological patients one must consider the underlying need for ventilation (e.g., airway protection versus hypoxemic respiratory failure). Moreover, NeuroICU patients may already experience frequent spontaneous hyperventilation and periodic breathing apneas from their primary injuries, making it difficult to apply optimal ventilator settings based on studies in non-neurological populations.",

It appears that poor sleep quality on PSG in the early stages of noninvasive ventilation is correlated with eventual failure (patient death, endotracheal intubation, persistent noninvasive ventilation requirement after 6 days) [63]. Of particular interest in the NeuroICU is the impact of ventilation mode on sleep in patients with neuromuscular disease. Much of the respiratory research in this population is done using noninvasive ventilation [64]. Similar to findings with invasive ventilation, Fanfulla and colleagues found that noninvasive pressure support set with physiological parameters (tailored to the patient\u2019s respiratory effort via measurement of esophageal pressure) among neuromuscular patients with chronic respiratory failure improves nighttime gas exchange, sleep architecture, and sleep efficiency [65].",

Many studies have found increases in blood pressure and heart rate after a single night of experimental deprivation [67\u201369], though effects can vary with subject posture during deprivation and vital sign measurement [70, 71]. Hospitalization itself is also associated with higher morning blood pressure in older adults [72]. The hypertensive effect of sleep deprivation has been attributed to an increase in sympathetic activity [73], a reduction in maximum endothelium-dependent vasodilation [52], and an upward resetting of the baroreflex set point [50, 57]. This relationship between sleep deprivation and blood pressure has particular relevance for NeuroICU patients with strict blood pressure parameters, e.g., patients with hypertensive and aneurysmal bleeds. In addition to its hypertensive effect, sleep deprivation is also correlated with increased blood pressure variability [74], which may worsen stroke outcomes [75, 76].",

This relationship holds true in OSA, in which higher numbers of apneic events correlate with increased blood pressure variability during wakefulness, a phenomenon which may precede the development of persistent hypertension [80]. OSA patients also have increased sympathetic activity and resting heart rate. An elevation in blood pressure and inflammation\u2014which also increases with chronic lack of sleep [81]\u2014may underlie this relationship, increasing cumulative cardiovascular risk. For example, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker shown to be an independent predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke in apparently healthy individuals [82, 83], are higher after experimental sleep deprivation [84]. Newly diagnosed OSA patients have also been found to have elevated levels of CRP, with severity proportional to the CRP level [85].",

In humans, Chen et al. found a significant reduction in maximal voluntary ventilation after 30 h of sleeplessness, with no change in respiratory muscle strength, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity [94]. Studies in rats [95] and exploratory work in humans [96] have suggested that the underlying mechanism is impairment of respiratory motor plasticity (i.e., inspiratory drive in response to hypoxia) with sleep deprivation, a finding that may be especially problematic among patients hospitalized for brain injury.",

The reduction of CBF in OSA may be attributed to damage to brain areas essential for vascular regulation (including the insular, cingulate, and medial frontal cortices; raphe and ventrolateral medulla) and an unexplained blunting of the typical vasodilator response to increased PaCO2 [104].

Several authors report a decline in NK cell function with sleep deprivation, and a return to baseline after one night of recovery sleep [112\u2013114]. One study did not find NK cell function recovery after resumed sleep [115], and one found an increase in NK cell activity after severe sleep deprivation (64 h) [116]. This variation might be explained by the difference in timing of blood draws across experiments, which may be confounded by the natural circadian rhythm of NK cell activity, and the small number of subjects in each of these studies (10 or fewer).",

A meta-analysis of 72 studies evaluating CRP (n > 34,000), IL-6 (n > 30,000), and TNF-a (n = 672) levels after sleep deprivation found higher levels of CRP with sleep disturbance and the extremes of short or long sleep, higher IL-6 with sleep disturbance and the extreme of long sleep, and no changes in TNF-a.

ICU survivors exhibit cognitive impairments across a similarly wide range of domains so-called post-intensive care syndrome. Between 25 and 78% of ICU survivors experience neurocognitive impairments, with acute respiratory distress syndrome patients particularly afflicted [151\u2013154]. While cognitive function has been found to improve in the first year after discharge, long-term studies assessing outcomes several years post-ICU stay have found persistent impairment after 6 years [155]. The extent of this cognitive impairment is notable: Jackson et al. found impairments in visual domains, psychomotor speed, and verbal fluency in ICU survivors at 6-month follow-up that were clinically equivalent to mild dementia [156]. The mechanisms by which this impairment occurs in the ICU include hypotension, hypoxemia, hyperglycemia, and delirium during admission [73]. The relationship between sleep deprivation and cognitive impairment in this setting has not been investigated directly.",

However, sleep deprivation of healthy subjects impairs mood as assessed using the Profile of Mood States rating scale [64, 159]. Underlying confinement to a laboratory setting can have a negative impact on mood [49, 160], which may confound findings in sleep studies lacking controls [69].

The conventional perspective is that pain impairs sleep, but sleep deprivation may also interfere with pain processing. Correlational studies in fibromyalgia patients have found more arousal episodes during sleep as compared to healthy controls [189], as well as an inverse relationship between subjective sleep quality and sensitivity to pressure pain [190]. In the acute setting, poor sleep has also been associated with a significantly greater pain experience among hospitalized burn patients [191]. Experimental work in healthy subjects has found that 24 to 40 h of total sleep deprivation causes either no [192, 193] or a generalized hyperalgesic effect [194], with a return to baseline following a night of recovery sleep [195]. The disruption of slow wave sleep seems particularly important in lowering the pain threshold [196, 197].",

Basic noise reduction interventions such as earplugs and white noise machines have been shown to promote longer and better quality sleep [198, 199]. New ICUs can consider noise reduction in their designs [200].

The timing of indoor lighting to reflect or augment the physiological 24-h circadian sleep\u2013wake cycle has been demonstrated to improve mood in seasonal affective disorder and non-seasonal depression [202]. A small pilot study with hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors found that full-spectrum white light administered for 30 min every morning for 4 weeks improved cancer-related fatigue as compared to non-stimulating dim red light [203]. For Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementia patients residing in healthcare facilities, lighting schemes that favor stimulating light with blue undertones in the morning appear to improve sleep time and efficiency [204]. Artificial light exposure during the daytime has been shown to decrease the incidence and duration of delirium [184]. Although more research is necessary to determine the benefits of circadian lighting schemes in the ICU setting, past work has shown subjective patient satisfaction with dynamic lighting environments without clear sleep benefits [205].",
