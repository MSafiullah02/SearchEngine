Given the current Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the infection among medical and nursing personnel is a common occurrence, ever since the first 15 affected cases were reported in Wuhan [2] . It was estimated that a total of 1716 Chinese HCWs were infected by COVID-19 till February 11, 2020 [3] . To better understand how to protect staff, it is necessary to understand the predisposing factors for HCWs infection and nosocomial transmission. This retrospective cohort study of HCWs with acute respiratory illness in the designated hospital of Wuhan University sought to determine risk factors and behaviors associated with the development of COVID-19.",

Our results highlight the importance of hand hygiene after contacting or caring for COVID-19 patients, which is highly consistent with other researches [11, 12] . As we all know, washing hands can significantly reduce the residual viruses or bacteria on your hands. Our research has some limitations. Recall bias on the part of HCWs is possible inherent in the survey study. To minimize the bias, investigators were required to verify the information using medical records in the hospital information system. Potential unmeasured confounding, especially with regards to gender differences was possibly another limitation. Hence, effect confounding was controlled as much as possible in the analysis. Limitations lie in small sample size, single-center aspect, and less representative research subjects, making the results difficult to be generalized.
