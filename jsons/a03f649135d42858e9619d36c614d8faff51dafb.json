Here, we report the discovery that this naturally occurring antibiotic inhibits two human neutral aminopeptidases, the cell-surface alanine aminopeptidase and intracellular methionine aminopeptidase type 2. These metallo-containing exopeptidases participate in tumor cell expansion and motility and are targets for anticancer therapies. We show that the peptide portions of Actinomycin D and Actinomycin X 2 are not required for effective inhibition, but the loss of these regions changes the mechanism of interaction. Two structurally less complex Actinomycin D analogs containing the phenoxazone chromophores, Questiomycin A and Actinocin, appear to be competitive inhibitors of both aminopeptidases, with potencies similar to the non-competitive macrocyclic parent compound (K i in the micromolar range).",

Particularly in the areas of antibiotic and anticancer therapies, natural products and their derivatives comprise a significant percentage of clinically used drugs [1] . Actinomycin D (ActD), also known as Dactinomycin, a small molecule naturally produced by Streptomyces bacteria [2] , was the first antibiotic shown to have anticancer activity. Approved for medical use in [3] , Dactinomycin has been mostly used as a remedy for a variety of mainly pediatric tumors, such as Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . ActD is a neutral molecule consisting of a planar phenoxazone ring substituted with two carboxylatelinked cyclic pentapeptides ( Figure 1 ). Its anticancer role has been associated with DNA functionality, leading to RNA, and consequently, protein synthesis inhibition [10] . ActD binds to double and single-stranded DNA (but not to RNA) with its phenoxazone ring intercalating with high specificity between GpC base pairs. Moreover, it stabilizes cleavable topoisomerase I and II complexes with DNA, in which the polypeptide lactone rings occupy a position in the minor groove of the DNA helix or the drug penetrates the topoisomerase-DNA binding area [11, 12] . After years of Actinomycin D usage, its action was also correlated with apoptosis; at low doses, the drug is a potent inducer of apoptosis [13, 14] , triggering this process in normal and tumor cells, as well as in cells that rarely undergo apoptosis [15] . It was shown that the molecular mechanism of Actinomycin D-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of the apoptosis FAS surface protein, which is also known as CD95 (cluster of differentiation 95) [16] , the non-mitochondrial stress-activated protein/Junminoterminal kinases apoptotic pathway, and with increased expression of the apoptosis regulator BAX [13] . Cells inducing apoptosis in the immune response pathway via Actinomycin D may also be associated with the expression of the CD69 surface antigen [17] . Additionally, the presence of intracellular ATP is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by Actinomycin D [18, 19] . In recent years, intensive research in laboratories and clinics has focused on the correlation between Actinomycin D activity and cellular tumor antigen p53 functionality and expression [20, 21] . ActD induces p53 expression [20, 22] . Apoptosis in patients with mutated or deleted p53 suggests a p53-independent cell death mechanism [23] . However, the function of p53 was restored after low doses of Actinomycin D in various TP53 wildtype tumor cell lines [22, 24] .",

MetAP2 is the best recognized member of the three known intracellular methionine aminopeptidases that catalyze the removal of the N-terminal methionine residue from a number of nascent proteins. This step is required before folding into their functional forms [35, 37] . The enzyme binds two cobalt [37] or manganese ions [38] in its active site. As higher MetAP2 expression was observed in tumor (mesothelioma, [39] neuroblastoma, [40] and colorectal carcinoma [41] ) cells compared with normal cells, the enzyme serves as a target for anti-angiogenic compounds of natural origin, such as fumagillin and ovalicin [42] . Selective inhibition of MetAP2 stops vascularization and tumor growth in animal models [43, 44] .",

In contrast to MetAP2, its active site is accessible to the exterior environment of the cell and the cell membrane anchoring its N-terminus [47] . Aminopeptidase N is described as a moonlighting protease with multiple functions, including antigen presentation. It is also a receptor for some human viruses, e.g., coronaviruses. These functions are connected not only to peptide cleavage but also to endocytosis, signaling and ligation or the inhibition of its enzymatic activity, which might result in complex and systemic effects [48] . APN overexpression has been observed in tumor cells from melanoma [49] , renal [50] , colon [51] , gastric [52, 53] , pancreatic [54] , and thyroid [55] cancers and on leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia [56] .

Inspired by these accounts we have suggested the 2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one scaffold as capable of binding to the aminopeptidase active sites. Indeed, the well-known antibiotic and anticancer drug Actinomycin D inhibits the two aminopeptidases HsAPN and HsMetAP2 with inhibition constants approximately 10 \u03bcM (Table 1 and Figure 2A ). Kinetic studies allowed us to determine the mechanism www.oncotarget.com of inhibition of Actinomycin D as non-competitive, with steady-state binding being achieved immediately ( Figure  2B ). Comparable results (within the experimental error) were obtained for Actinomycin X 2 , a structure closely related to ActD. A minor variation in the amino acid composition of the \u03b1 peptide side chain ( Figure 1 ) did not influence their binding affinities. Despite structural similarity to ActD medicinal properties of Actinomycin X 2 have been scarcely investigated. For example, Actinomycin X 2 was reported to show higher cytotoxicity of the human leukemia cell line HL-60 (LC 50 = 8 nM, LC 50 is the lethal concentration for a half of population) than Actinomycin D (LC 50 = 45 nM) [64] . Further studies proposed Actinomycin X 2 as an inducer of apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells through the mTOR pathway compounded by miRNA144 [65] .",

The modeled binding of ActD/Actinomycin X 2 with HsAPN ( Figure 3 ) and HsMetAP2 ( Figure 4 ) showed complex sets of contacts based on typical peptide-protein interactions at different conformations. In the case of APN [76] , both drugs most typically penetrated the interior of the enzyme and filled the characteristic central cavity, which was apt to accept large peptide substrates ( Figure 3A and 3B). The modeled assembly was generally stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network ( Figure 3C and 3D), particularly welldefined for Actinomycin X 2 . Arg381 of HsAPN has been identified as a residue highly involved in binding. For Actinomycin D its terminal guanidine nitrogen atom forms a convenient hydrogen bond bridge between both C=O groups of the heteroaromatic ring-substituting carboxyamides (2.91 \u00c5 and 3.34 \u00c5, respectively, Figure 3C ). In contrast, for the most favorable Actinomycin X 2 conformation ( Figure 3D) , the corresponding N atom of Arg381 is engaged in interactions with the \u03b1 cyclic peptide via two tight contacts with C=O of D-Val (2.54 \u00c5) and Thr (2.61 \u00c5). The extra oxygen atom of oxoPro is pointed towards the \u03b1-nitrogen of the same enzyme residue (3.29 \u00c5). The \u03b2 peptidyl ring of the inhibitor is also favorably bound by the guanidine residue of Arg829, with distances 2.76 \u00c5 and 2.81 \u00c5 to C=O of Thr and N-MeVal, respectively. The Thr residue is in additional contacts with the hydroxyl group of Ser861 (2.64 \u00c5, via C=O) and the carboxylate of Asp855 (2.90 \u00c5, via N-H). Finally, the amino group of phenoxazinone interacts with -OH of Tyr477, a group which is involved in the transition state stabilization during the natural substrate cleavage.",

The heterocyclic system is exposed to the outside and hardly contributes to this lipophilic binding. Nevertheless, the functional groups of 2-amino-3Hphenoxazin-3-one form a set of hydrogen bond contacts. The 2-amino group is bridged between the carboxylate of Asp442 (2.81 \u00c5) and the hydroxyl O atom of Tyr444 (2.94 \u00c5). The latter is also in a favorable position to N-H of d-Val of the cyclic peptide \u03b1 (2.95 \u00c5). In addition, the 3-oxo group of the inhibitor forms a contact with the N-H of Phe387 (3.10 \u00c5).

For human APN, the heteroaromatic ring is conveniently positioned in the hydrophobic environment while a functional group oxygen atom is directed towards the Zn ion. Interestingly, flipping the molecule does not seem to disturb the preferential binding. The highest rating docking score was shown for the conformation where the carbonyl oxygen atom is involved in an interaction with the metal cation (1.88 \u00c5, Figure 5A ). The oxygen was also in a tight hydrogen bond proximity to the Tyr477 -OH group (2.58 \u00c5). These two contacts and the stabilization of the neighboring amino group by Glu355 (2.88 \u00c5) and Gln213 (3.14 \u00c5), similar to the peptide N-termini, closely resembles the substrate-enzyme complex, including the carbonyl positioning for the nucleophilic water attack.

This interaction was further strengthened by the close three-dimensional fit of the molecule in the active site provided by hydrophobic contacts with Phe219, Ala230, Ile338 and His382 and hydrogen bonds. In particular, the latter involved interactions between the 2-amino group and the Ala229 (2.82 \u00c5) and Lys 249 (2.30 \u00c5) oxygen atoms, as well as the 3-oxo group and the Ser224 hydroxyl (2.41 \u00c5). This set of favorable interactions gave rise to the highest theoretical docking score for Actinocin to MetAP and was consistent with the lowest obtained inhibition constant values. Lacking both carboxylate groups, Questiomycin A loses the affinity of Actinocin to both APN and MetAP. The decrease in inhibitory activity is not dramatic, approximately one order of magnitude, but demonstrates that the metal-binding moieties are important but not critical for the structure and potency of a good ligand. Indeed, according to the molecular modeling results, the general fit of the heteroaromatic system and specific hydrogen bonds are reproduced for Questiomycin A in the active sites of the human metallopeptidases ( Figure   7A and 7B). For HsAPN ( Figure 7A ) the 3-oxo group of Questiomycin A is firmly bridged between Arg381 guanidine nitrogen atoms (2.66 \u00c5 and 2.70 \u00c5, respectively) while the heteroaromatic ligand core is nested in the hydrophobic environment of Ala351, Ala353, Val385 and His388. Similarly, the structurally simplest inhibitor reproduces interactions of the functional groups with MetAP. 2-Amino group is hydrogen-bonded with C=O of Ala229 (3.07 \u00c5), Lys 249 (2.88 \u00c5) and Gln457 (2.84 \u00c5), while the 3-oxo group with the Ser224 hydroxyl (2.44 \u00c5). The lipophilic contacts involve Ala230, His231 and Ile338. Taking in account these close similarities of Questiomycin A versus Actinocin binding, it can concluded that the difference in their activities are predominantly caused by the absence of metal coordination by carboxylates.",

It is still present in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines [78] , which contains the most effective and safest medicines required by any proper health system. While ActD is widely used in the treatment of cancer, intensive research on its mechanism of action, as well as on clinical trials with Actinomycin D in combination with other drugs, are progressing. At low concentrations, Actinomycin D inhibits proliferation and induces cell death in neuroblastoma cell lines, as well as tumor regression in xenograft tumor models. Cortes et al. proved experimentally that apoptosis is the major cell death mechanism caused by Actinomycin D treatment in p53wt cells, though less so in p53-deficient cell lines [79] . The combination of Actinomycin with drugs as Nutlin-3 [80] and the immunotoxin RG7787 [81] have improved the anticancer activities of the latter by activating apoptosis and p53.",

Accordingly, in recent years, methionine aminopeptidase type 2, as well as alanyl aminopeptidase, have become extremely specialized targets for the development of new inhibitors [48, 58-63, 76, 77, 84, 85] . Most known MetAP2 inhibitors are irreversible binding synthetic analogues of fumagillin [77, 86] , two of which, TNP-470 and Beloranib, have advanced to clinical trials. TNP-47 has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. It entered clinical development for cancer as an anti-angiogenic agent and has achieved Phase I/II trials for Kaposi's sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer. However, the trials have not led to its approval for clinical applications. Beloranib was originally designed as an angiogenesis inhibitor similar to TNP-470 for the treatment of cancer. Once the potential anti-obesity effects of MetAP2 inhibition became apparent during trials, clinical development began to focus on these effects, and Beloranib has shown positive results Inhibitor and enzyme amino acid residues are shown as sticks.

Nevertheless, there is no correlation between these properties and the inhibition of the neutral aminopeptidases MetAP2 and APN that is highly important in cancer progression. Blocking the activity of MetAP2 and APN with Actinomycin D or its analogs seems to be promising for the development of new generations of potent anticancer agents that would be implicated in different mechanisms of action and directed against multiple molecular targets. In view of the network nature of cancer [98] , the use of combinations of inhibitors appears to be indicated, as well as alternative drugs with multiple specificities. Actinomycin D may prove to be such a drug for targeting a network rather than a single molecule. The discovery reported here may contribute to the development of better therapies.",

For the initial state measurements, the enzymes were preincubated for 15-30 min at 37\u00b0C before adding the substrate and inhibitor to the wells. The following conditions were used: (1) total volume 100 \u03bcL, (2) eight different inhibitor concentrations, and (3) enzyme concentration of 0.3 nM for human APN and 1 nM for MetAP2. The release of the AMC fluorophore was monitored. The linear portion of the progress curve was used to calculate the velocity. hPhePCH 2 Phe [62, 95] for APN and ebselen [63] for MetAP2 were used as a positive control. The inhibition mechanism was determined from the Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plot ( Figure 2B and 2D) . The IC 50 values were calculated from the reaction velocity to inhibitor concentration plot fitted to the equation log[I] vs. response. The K i values were equal to the IC 50 for non-competitive inhibitors [66] and were calculated for competitive inhibitors using the following equation: K i = (IC 50 -[E]/2)/ (1 + ([S]/Km)) [66] , where the IC 50 is the concentration of the inhibitor that effected 50% inhibition, [S] and K m are the substrate concentration and Michaelis constant in the absence of inhibitor, respectively, and [E] is the concentration of the enzyme. www.oncotarget.com",

The enzyme models were protonated at pH 7.5 and minimized with the CHARMM force field. The water molecules and former ligands were removed. New ligands were protonated at the same pH and the partial charges of all the atoms were computed using the Momany-Rone algorithm. Minimizations used the CHARMM force field with the Smart Minimizer algorithm up to an RMS gradient of 0.1 \u00c5. Actinomycin D, Actinomycin X 2 , Actinocin and Questiomycin A were docked into the enzyme active center using the LibDock docking algorithm.
