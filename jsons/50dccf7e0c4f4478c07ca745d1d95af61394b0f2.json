Cities with poor sanitation are important locations to investigate this aerial exposure pathway as their rapid growth will pose unprecedented challenges in waste management. To address this issue, simple surveillance methods are needed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to optimize a community exposure bioaerosol surveillance strategy for urban outdoor locations with poor sanitation, and to determine which bioaerosols could contribute to exposure. Passive Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 and active bioaerosol sampling methods were used to characterize the fate and transport of sanitation-related bioaerosols during the rainy and dry seasons in La Paz, Bolivia. Median coliform bacteria fluxes were 71 CFU/(m 2 \u00d7h) during the rainy season and 64 CFU/(m 2 \u00d7h) during the dry season, with 38% of the dry season samples testing positive for E. coli. Wind speed, relative humidity and UVB irradiance were identified as significant covariates to consider in bioaerosol transport models in La Paz. Active sampling yielded one positive sample (10%) for human adenovirus (HadV) and one sample (10%) for influenza A virus during the rainy season.",

Even so, the exposure to enteric pathogens through the air and associated risk of infection is scarce in the literature outside of narrowly defined settings. It has been shown that concentrated sources of fecal matter can release bioaerosols through different mechanisms, e.g., wind erosion or mechanical disturbance (Farling et J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 Considering people living in cities with poor sanitation are broadly exposed to a variety of fecal pathogens through multiple pathways, e.g., fluids, fingers, flies, floors or food (Wagner and Lanoix, 1958) , it is paramount to better understand fecal pathogen transport and exposure routes in order to minimize disease transmission. Moreover, cities with rapid urban growth will face unprecedented challenges in waste management, potentially causing an increase in diarrheal diseases that could create lifetime health deficits (Neiderud et al., 2015) . Recent modelling efforts have found high risks of infection and illness from airborne Rotavirus and Norovirus emitted from wastewater treatment plants in Iran (Pasalari et al., 2019) as well as identification of key areas in such facilities that increase the risk of illness from bioaerosol exposure (Carducci et al., 2018) . Hence, we are conducting a series of studies looking at sanitation-related bioaerosols in developing countries to better understand their potential health impacts. The main goals of our study were 1) to optimize a robust and practical community exposure bioaerosol surveillance strategy in outdoor environments with poor sanitation and 2) explore if these bioaerosols are at personal exposure levels (~3-13 L air /min (EPA, 2011)) in such contexts. We conducted this study testing different sampling methods to characterize the fate and transport of sanitation-related bioaerosols during the rainy and dry seasons in La Paz, Bolivia in 2019, as seasonal effects on aerosolized pathogenic microorganisms have been observed (Fan et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019) . Thus, we evaluated multiple environmental factors to explore their impact upon bioaerosols in real-world scenarios using low-cost instrumentation, identifying the key parameters to be included in future context-specific risk assessments and surveillance efforts.",

With a unique geography, the city lies in a canyon with poor urban planning.

Unfortunately, the percentage of positive samples for E. coli during the rainy season is unknown due to growth medium presumably being damaged by sunlight, making it difficult to reliably differentiate E. coli from total coliforms (only 1 out 60 replicates had noticeable pink CFUs). CFU differentiation was possible during the dry season but we still noticed changes on the agar, shown in the positive controls in Figure B1 ",

This regression model addressed the fact that 35% and 33% of our passive samples were below detection limit (<1 CFU per plate) in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. We also fitted a negative binomial distribution to these data to account for its overdispersion (residual variance >> predicted variance). We found that wind speed had a significant positive, and UVB irradiance a significant negative effect on fluxes (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively) in the rainy season while positive effects from RH and UVB (p<0.05 for both) were found in the dry season. While the trends during the rainy season are as expected, the positive effect of UV during the dry season is puzzling. We suspect that it could be due to i) higher bacterial flux rates compared to UVB induced death rates during the study (Tong and Lighthart, 1997) . ii) Light shielding effects J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 by large particles attached to the bacteria (Tong and Lighthart, 1998), or a reduction in inactivation potential due to an effect of low RH on UVB-induced bacterial decay, suggesting that the average spherical irradiance may not be independent of UV dose at RH<40% (Peccia et al., 2001) . Overall, our results suggest that sanitation-related bioaerosols' viability and transport are likely to be most affected by UV radiation and wind speed, in agreement with previous bioaerosol studies that found a negative effect from solar radiation (Tong and Lighthart, 1997), wind speed playing a key role in bioaerosol dispersion, affecting mechanical turbulence and particle deposition, and RH having both positive and negative effects on inactivation rates (Van Leuken et al., 2016). Further investigations are needed to better quantify these effects.",

We did not find a significant difference in the CFU fluxes observed after 24 h of incubation between plates with or without mineral oil (p=0.9055, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n=60).

Continuous surveillance efforts would allow further hypothesis testing and improvement of bioaerosol transport modelling. Second, the damage that happened to the growth media may have resulted in viable but non culturable organisms, leading to an underestimation of fluxes or misidentification of E. coli. Third, the low volumes sampled for molecular analysis, while realistic from an exposure perspective, resulted in a low number of positive hits. Increased sampling flow-rates or longer sampling periods would permit better quantification of pathogens as well as the use of the data for microbial source tracking.",

MI agar and Compact Dry plates were tested in the field as alternatives to AT medium for bioaerosol passive sampling (n=60, in duplicates). However, they were outperformed by AT medium in determining CFU fluxes (Fig. B1 ). While Compact Dry was deemed better in identifying E. coli qualitatively in the laboratory, its medium was damaged after 2 h of exposure to field conditions while sampling, regardless of the time in the day (Fig. B1 , image I), preventing the identification and quantification of E. coli. In addition, its dry surface may not allow accurate flux determination as particles may be more likely to bounce back into the air (Pepper and Dowd, 2009 ). MI agar E. coli-staining chromogen was damaged by extended sunlight exposure while sampling, as E. coli colonies did not turn blue (Fig. B1 , image II and III) consistent with the manufacturer's instructions to keep plates in the dark (BD Diagnostics, 2009). MI agar was also affected by the lower relative humidity in the Dry Season, losing surface area coverage (Fig. B1 , image III). Relative humidity (RH) during the rainy season campaign had a mean with standard deviation of 46\u00b16% while the dry season campaign had a mean RH of 30\u00b112%.",

Finally, we noticed a reduction in CFU in AT and MI positive controls when plated before and after being taken to the field while sampling (Fig. B1 , images II and V), which was expected as solar inactivation of bacteria can happen (Paez-Rubio and Peccia, 2005) . Our findings suggest that UVB irradiance plays an important role on AT's performance to identify and quantify E. coli accurately and that AT medium is more resilient to environmental conditions compared to Compact Dry plates and MI agar.

Recent research has focused among others on developing real-time bioaerosol sensors using fluorescence spectra to monitor bioaerosol emissions (Tian et al., 2020), characterizing the effect of aeration on bioaerosol generation during wastewater treatment (Wang et al., 2019) and chemical and molecular fingerprinting of outdoor bioaerosols to track their source and transport in different meteorological conditions (Garcia-Alcega et al., 2020).

All other sites were only sampled in the rainy season. Three to six 100 mm settle Petri dishes (replicates) were set for 2 hours at 1 m from the ground and 1 m from any obstacle, based on published methods for passive sampling (Haig et al., 2016; Pasquarella et al., 2000). We calculated the fluxes (CFU/(m 2 \u00d7h)) by dividing the CFU counts by the area of the Petri dish (7.854\u00d710 -3 m 2 ) and the time at each site (2 h). We used the open-source Aquatest (AT) (Bain et al., 2015) selective J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 growth medium, Difco TM MI Agar (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and Compact-Dry-EC plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) for sampling and enumeration of viable fecal coliforms and E. coli. We conducted active sampling using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) BC 251 Personal Aerosol Samplers (Cao et al., 2011) in parallel to passive sampling, for 2 hours at each sampling event (n=10 in rainy season, n=25 in dry season). The NIOSH sampler was selected because it had been used for personal exposure studies (Coleman et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018, Bailey et al., 2018). It uses a sampling rate of 3.5 L/min which simulates human breathing and thus is relevant to personal exposure. For the experiments reported herein, the sampler was located \uf0b32 m next to the passive sampling setup. The sampling flowrate was calibrated at 3.5 L/min before each sampling event. The NIOSH device sorts organisms by size in three compartments: greater than 4 \u00b5m, 1-4 \u00b5m, and < 1 \u00b5m. These particles were collected in a 15 mL falcon tube, a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) back-up filter (0.3 \u00b5m pore, 37 mm), respectively (Choi et al., 2018).

The sampling site located at the beginning of the open sewer (location a on Fig. A1) had the highest next to the river in both seasons and our concurrent transect samples taken at 10-100 m downwind of the open sewer at two different locations showed a reduction in fluxes asthe distance from the river increased(Fig. 1). The deposition of aerosolized pathogens on food, water or fomites is known to be a potential source for exposure(de Man et al., 2014). For example, it was the suspected cause of an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak at a county fair in Oregon, USA(Keene et al., 2004). Continuous passive sampling with a highly selective medium such as AT could allow rapid and low-cost monitoring of bioaerosols to better understand the prevalence of such events, without needing highly trained personnel or high-tech equipment.We conducted molecular analyses (RT-PCR) of actively sampled aerosols (using the NIOSH sampler) for influenza viruses, HadV, coronaviruses, and enteroviruses to test for potentialpresence of respiratory pathogens with aerosolized enteric bacteria. One sample (10%) was positive for HadV (positive hit on >4 \u00b5m compartment and in the <4 \u00b5m combined eluent) and one sample (10%) was positive for influenza A virus during the rainy season (positive hit on >4 \u00b5m compartment only). The HadV positive sample was from the site with the highest bacterial flux. Four samples (8%) were positive for influenza A virus in the dry season (all in the <4 \u00b5m compartment). HadV is commonly found in faecally-contaminated water and can cause enteric and respiratory infections through ingestion and inhalation, typically resulting in mild illness (WHO, 2005). A 2018 risk assessment study found high risks of illness from aerosolized HadV at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Carducci et al., 2018) supporting previous findings of adverse occupational-health effects in WWTPs (Thorn and Kerekes, 2001; Douwes et al., 2001). Influenza A virus, on the other hand, is well known to infect animals and humans alike through aerosols, causing respiratory illnesses with the potential to result in epidemics(Tellier,  et al., 2019)  and detecting it through environmental sampling would enable local authorities to respond adequately. We did not detect any of the coronaviruses we tested for (NL63/OC43/HKU1/229E), and we did not test for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the 2020 pandemic, as the study took place 5 months before the first known case of COVID-19 was identified(Andersen et al., 2020). The detection of viruses at low-flow rates (3.5 L/min) in short sampling periods (2 h) is of interest as viruses cause ~60% of infection cases, and to date, there are limited vaccines or antiviral medications(Boone and Gerba, 2007). In this light, itis likely that open sewers could be contributing to community exposure to viruses in places with poor sanitation, but the magnitude of the exposure needs further characterization (i.e., concentration measurements and infectivity assays to determine if the virus remains infectious).The recent coronavirus pandemic highlights the susceptibility of our society to viral infection and the needs for surveillance systems for early detection of disease outbreaks.Our efforts to sequence aerosolized viruses to identify the sub-types were unsuccessful because the concentration of DNA was too low. However, our detection of viruses at sites with high enteric bacterial fluxes indicates that open sewers may be associated with enteric virus detection through aerosolization of contaminated water and sewage. Enteric viruses are known to remain viable for weeks to months, while respiratory viruses can do so for hours to multiple days(Boone and Gerba, 2007). Nevertheless, the contamination of non-porous fomites, such as the several playgrounds of La Paz located near our sampling sites, could harbor enteric viruses, potentially remaining infectious. At minimum, fomite sampling at those location is needed to begin understanding personal exposure. Total Coliform fluxes at three sampling sites during the rainy season and dry season.",

A 2018 study in Beijing suggested that bioaerosols may represent a greater health hazard during the winter (dry season), after finding that microbial compositions of PM 2.5 had more pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Du et al., 2018). In contrast, Masclaux and collaborators found aerosolized HadV in 100% of their samples taken from 31 WWTPs in the summer and 97% in the winter in Switzerland Masclaux et al., 2014). The latter findings indicate a more uniform emission of bioaerosols from well-managed systems, commonly found in the developed world. Places with poor sanitation face a bigger challenge as open sewers or animal and human waste are not restricted spatially, increasing the possibility of community exposure.",

The experimental deposition velocity was in the same order of magnitude of the theoretical deposition velocity (10 -4 m/s), calculated using the Stokes settling velocity equation corrected by the Cunningham factor (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). A summary of the collected data can be found in Appendix A -Table A2. The concentration at 10 m downwind from the river was found using the Gaussian plume model (Equation 2) and with the following assumptions: i) Bioaerosols only traveled in the wind direction and estimates were for ground level concentrations only (z=0, y=0) ii) Concentrations were back-calculated using bacterial fluxes and theoretical particle deposition velocities. iiii) The stack height was fixed at 4.68 m above the sewer, incorporating the height (3.68 m) from the water level to the ground and adding one meter above ground at which the measurements were made. iv) Wind speed was constant for each site. v) One outlier data point was removed for the model. vi) The theoretical deposition velocity was estimated to be 1.37 m/h for spherical particles with a diameter range of 2-5 \u00b5m and a density of 1000 kg/m 3 .",

Comprehensive guidelines for model development and modelling software are available, e.g., through the Unites States EPA Support Center for Regulatory Atmospheric Modeling (EPA, 2020).
