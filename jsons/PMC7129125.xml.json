Questionnaires were distributed to midwives between March and November 1998. However, they were received primarily by women who gave birth in the spring and autumn months of the same year, as midwives were often on vacation during the summer months. The authors argued that there was no possibility of selection bias (where errors are present in the selection of study participants and may skew trial data). The study found no significant effect on birth weight following pre-natal consumption of glycyrrhiza. However, it was noted instead that heavy glycyrrhiza use correlated strongly with lower gestational ages. When gestational age of 38 weeks was considered as a cut-off point, odds ratio for preterm delivery associated with heavy glycyrrhiza intake was 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.1\u20135.5, p\n = 0.03).",

Consequently, in a subsequent study published in 2002 (Strandberg et al., 2002) by the same authors, the effect of glycyrrhiza on pregnant women was examined. This study involved a sample of 95 Finnish women who delivered preterm births and were then compared with women who delivered babies of normal gestational age in the same hospital. To establish glycyrrhizin intake, questionnaires were issued to each of the women to ascertain their liquorice consumption. Glycyrrhizin consumption was graded in three strata: low (<250 mg/week), moderate (250\u2013499 mg/week), and heavy (\u2265500 mg/week). The results showed that heavy consumption versus a lower level of consumption was associated with, in excess of a twofold increased risk of preterm (<37 weeks) delivery, with a borderline significance. The association was more apparent in the fully adjusted model when only the 40 births classified as early preterm delivery (<34 weeks) were included (odds ratio = 3.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.17\u20138.05). As a result of these studies, WHM recommends caution if prescribing glycyrrhiza to pregnant women.",

As illustrated by the trial flow in Fig. 2\n, this study exhibited several issues. First, because data on liquorice consumption was collected through the use of a retrospective postnatal questionnaire, the actual amount of liquorice consumed by a subject may be different to that reported. Second, in a case-control study, statistical analysis is conventionally based on the \u2018odds ratio\u2019. The odds ratio is defined as the ratio of odds in the case group (i.e. the proportion of people given exposure divided by that of people not given exposure) to the corresponding odds in the control group (Fig. 3\n). In this study, the odds ratio is 2.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.98\u20134.86, p\n = 0.056), thus termed as insignificant. Similar issues with this study have been reported by Slattery and Morrison, where they called for further assessment of the role of liquorice in preterm births (Slattery and Morrison, 2003).",

According to the study, more than half of the pregnant women received medication containing glycyrrhiza to treat acute illness, including influenza. Infection is an important cause of stillbirths (Goldenberg et al., 2010). Maternal infection might lead to systemic illness in the mother and thus cause the foetus to die because of high maternal fever, respiratory distress or other systemic reactions. Alternatively, if infection occurs early in gestation, the foetus might not die immediately but development of a congenital anomaly could cause foetal death at a later stage.",

It should be understood that, in Korea, patients do not generally know the ingredients contained in their prescription because Korean medicine doctors often modify original herbal medications according to their examination. Additionally, there are many Korean medicine doctors who prescribe herbal medications based on the principles of \u2018Four-Constitution\u2019 medicine. These principles represent a branch of traditional Korean medicine in which patients are assumed to consist of four types (i.e. greater yang, lesser yang, greater yin, and lesser yin person). According to these principles, glycyrrhiza can be prescribed to only \u2018lesser yin\u2019 patients, although the majority of Korean people are known to be \u2018greater yin\u2019 in nature.
