The most common cause of community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia in adults is viral with the most frequently detected pathogen being human rhinovirus, followed by influenza (9\u201315% and 4\u20136%, respectively) (4\u20138). Other commonly detected causes of viral pneumonia include adenovirus, conventional coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza. The prevalence of viral respiratory illness is temporal in North America, with peaks of influenza, HMPV, and RSV normally seen in the winter months (Table 1) (1).",

The common clinical presentation of acute viral respiratory infection includes cough, dyspnea, fever, and pleuritic chest pain. Viral etiologies of lower respiratory infection are less likely to cause sputum production, and if present, tends to be watery or scant. In contrast, sputum production tends to be mucopurulent when due to bacterial pneumonia (8, 9). Clinical signs of viral respiratory illness include fever, rales (crackles) on auscultation, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. These four signs together have a positive predictive value of 57.1%, with fever as the strongest clinically predictive sign of a viral respiratory infection versus that of bacterial etiology (10). Typically, patients with viral pneumonia also will present with a normal leukocyte count and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph (9). Severe viral pneumonia can manifest as sepsis and respiratory distress requiring intensive care (11). In many moderate to severe cases of pneumonia, hypoxemia occurs from impaired alveolar gas exchange (12), often necessitating mechanical ventilation.",

In a recent single-center study, differences in admission plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and INF-\u03b3 were observed between different etiologies of CAP, with INF-\u03b3 most elevated in viral CAP (24). Conversely, a similar study demonstrated, admission plasma cytokine levels were not statistically different based on etiology (bacterial vs viral vs mixed bacterial-viral vs unknown etiology) (25). Other studies noted that serum transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) levels predicted viral pneumonia, as opposed to other etiologies of CAP, where TGF-\u03b2 had negative correlations with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in patients that progressed to sepsis (26, 27). Therefore, although the specific cytokine profile elicited by particular viruses is unknown, it is clear that, as with most etiologies of sepsis, an elevation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are responsible for the host septic and systemic inflammatory response syndrome response in all severe viral cases of pneumonia (23, 28\u201330).",

Pattern recognition receptors on respiratory epithelial cells, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), detect evolutionarily conserved microbial ligands, or PAMPs (31, 32). Viral PAMPs are typically viral envelope proteins or nucleic acids motifs within the DNA or RNA genomes of the virus, which are critical for structure and function (33). The recognition of viral PAMPs leads to transcription and release of type I interferons (33) which effect decreased expression of viral proteins and replication, enhance antigen presentation and NK cell function, and augment adaptive immune responses. Additional recognition of host cell constituents from damaged or dying cells, recognized as DAMPs, are thought to control the magnitude of the immune response (34\u201336). Together, PAMPs and DAMPs play a major role in the initiation of both the innate and adaptive immune response to viral lung infection (31, 35, 37\u201340).",

Most research on viral-bacterial respiratory coinfection has been focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of influenza viruses given its high propensity to cause pandemics and higher mortality when compared with the other viruses (13). Influenza A causes a reduction in murine alveolar macrophages and dysregulation of remaining macrophages and neutrophils, one of the body\u2019s primary defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens (47\u201349). Additionally, prior infection with influenza virus attenuates bacterial induced release of IL-17 leading to decreased innate T cell-mediated bacterial clearance (49). Replication of IAV in respiratory epithelium impairs mucociliary clearance, allowing for increased bacterial colonization (34, 50, 51). Additionally, there is evidence of sustained desensitization of TLR ligands following viral infection, leading to decreased chemokine release and nuclear factor kappa B activation in macrophages (52, 53). This in turn results in attenuated neutrophil recruitment, further decreasing the ability to reduce bacterial load in secondary bacterial infection (52, 53).",

The most severely ill group of 12 patients demonstrated impaired expression of numerous genes participating in adaptive immune responses (e.g., diminished antigen presentation, B-cell development, T-helper cell differentiation, and apoptosis), suggesting impaired adaptive immunity in severe viral pneumonia (55).

There are many trials underway attempting to attenuate the disease with remdesivir, IL-6 receptor blockers, IL-7, and antiretrovirals such as lopinavir-ritonavir (82). The New England Journal of Medicine recently published a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care alone in the treatment of adult hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. There were no differences in hospital mortality, time to clinical improvement, or viral RNA levels. Although the median time to improvement was 1 day shorter with lopinavir-ritonavir on intention-to-treat analysis, 14% of patients had adverse events requiring treatment discontinuation. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no benefit observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment versus standard treatment of severe COVID-19 patients (83). Historically, hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory agent, has shown some promise in reducing mortality from SARS and, therefore, is currently being studied for COVID-19 (84). In one very limited study from France (n = 20 per group, nonrandomized), hydroxychloroquine was associated with reduced viral load and reduced duration of viral detection which was further attenuated by the addition of azithromycin (85).",

Additionally, rules limiting the people entering the isolation room and requiring logging of healthcare workers involved in COVID-19 patient care should be followed to effectively monitor patient contact and limit spread. All equipment (monitors, etc.) in the isolation room should be designated for the case patient only. Physicians should limit potential spread by recognizing any necessary aerosol-generating procedures and preparing accordingly (e.g., for intubation using controlled measures including paralytics, video laryngoscopy, N95 masks).
