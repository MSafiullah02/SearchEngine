Second, one must identify autoantibodies within a lesion or serum of patients with a direct correlation to disease activity or observed clinical improvement after immunosuppressive treatment. In systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), a well-characterized autoimmune disorder, the presentation of autoantigens by T cells promotes antibody formation and hence, the clinical manifestations.9 It is also critical to reproduce the clinical and histopathologic aspects of the human disease after administration of the autoantibody or autoantigen within an animal. For example, when transferring anti-DNA antibodies to na\u00efve recipient mice, there is an immunologic reaction against glomerular antigens leading to nephropathy similar to that seen in SLE.10 Diseases like SLE have an experimental-based extensive literature that meets all the criteria and proves the role of autoimmunity in the pathophysiology.",

The idea is plausible because other demyelinating diseases of the CNS like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy are caused by a virus: the JC virus in immune-compromised individuals.37 Recently, much attention has focused on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) because EBV antigens are expressed at significantly higher levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of some MS patients compared with controls.38 However, studies show an absence of intrathecal anti-EBV antibody synthesis in nearly 93% of patients with MS, which argues against this hypothesis.39 Hence, the association of EBV with adult MS is not well established, and its role in pathogenesis remains to be determined. Other viral agents like varicella zoster and rubella are considered as possible risk factors but not causal agents.40, 41 Of note, vitamin D deficiency has been linked as a causal agent in relapsing remitting MS. Vitamin D has a role in regulating immune function. Low levels of this vitamin could produce an immune-deficient state against viral agents. Although clinical trials and observational studies using high levels of vitamin D have only shown modest reductions in the levels of interleukin 17, it has not been seen in other inflammatory markers.42, 43 The fact that high dose treatment of vitamin D in MS patients has scant effect on the overall course of the disease does not support this theory.",

Recent studies found that in MS, damage to myelin is not enough to produce the spectrum of symptoms. In humans, levels of demyelination are not strictly correlated to disease stage, neurologic deficits, or lesion pathology.50, 51, 52 Imaging studies in postmortem brains using MRI have shown how axonal injury is the primary event leading to clinical deficits (more than demyelination).53, 54\n",

The extensive characterization of MS pathology, immunology, and serology has misled many investigators to conclude that MS is an autoimmune disease. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the role of active autoantigens and autoantibodies driving the inflammatory and demyelinating cascades seen in patients with MS. Understanding the role of axonal injury and its relationship with clinical deficits is essential for a future drug. Future trials should aim a multifaceted approach with several reagents that target remyelination, protections of axons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell, and suppressive therapies against active inflammatory cell populations.",
