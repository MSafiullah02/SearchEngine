A study has suggested the efficacy of combination therapy with ART-123 and PMX-HP; however, it did not evaluate the effect modification between them. We hypothesised that coadministration of ART-123 and PMX-HP has a significant positive effect modification on survival outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect modification between ART-123 and PMX-HP treatment on the survival outcome of sepsis using post hoc analysis of the dataset of the Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation registry.",

Coagulopathy is a complication of sepsis that causes organ dysfunction and leads to high mortality [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In addition, coagulopathy and sepsis adversely affect each other via crosstalk between coagulation and inflammation pathways [14] . Therefore, several anticoagulants expected to control coagulopathy and reduce the mortality of sepsis have been investigated [15] [16] [17] . ART-123 (recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin) is a novel anticoagulant that also has an anti-inflammatory effect [18] . Although the clinical efficacy of ART-123 in reducing the mortality of sepsis has been thoroughly investigated [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , its effects were not significant in a recently published phase 3 randomised controlled trial (RCT) known as the SCARLET trial [25] .",

            "text": "Although recently published RCTs have not confirmed the significant positive effects of ART-123 and PMX-HP on sepsis survival outcomes, previous studies using a dataset of 3195 registered adult patients with sepsis revealed significant efficacy for these approaches in reducing hospital mortality [35, 36] . It has been suggested that specific target populations may obtain survival benefits from these therapies [24, 37, 38] . Therefore, differences in the characteristics of the patients analysed in these studies compared to those enrolled in the RCTs may explain the conflicting results. However, because the retrospective design makes it difficult to completely eliminate factors that can affect outcomes, there might be other reasons for the discrepancies, such as effect modifications with other therapies. In a 22-patient, single-centre study in 2013, Yamato et al. [39] reported the efficacy of a combination therapy with ART-123 and PMX-HP for patients with septic shock accompanied by DIC. However, the study did not evaluate the effect modification between these therapies, because, generally, a large sample size is needed to reveal a significant effect modification. The above dataset, named the Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (J-Septic DIC) registry, is a unique published dataset that includes many patients who received anticoagulant therapies for septic coagulopathy and/or blood purification for septic shock [40] . The knowledge of effect modifications between these therapies, which cannot be assessed within a single RCT including only one of them, would be useful for further research and clinical decisions. Therefore, we hypothesised that there would be a significant effect modification between ART-123 and PMX-HP, which would affect survival outcomes in this dataset. In the present study, we evaluated the effect modification between the administration of ART-123 and treatment with PMX-HP on survival outcome using the dataset of the J-Septic DIC registry.",

In that report, survival times between propensity score-matched ART-123 and control groups were significantly different (HR: 0.781, 95% CI 0.624-0.977; P = 0.030). In this study, although the inclusion criteria and statistical model used were different, the main effect of ART-123 administration, before adjusting for product terms, was also significantly beneficial to survival (adjusted HR: 0.834, 95% CI 0.695-0.999; P = 0.049). However, we also observed a significant effect modification between treatments with ART-123 and PMX-HP. Thus, the effect of ART-123 observed in the study by Hayakawa et al. may also have been influenced by that effect modification. In that study, 31.6% of patients in the ART-123 group after propensity score matching also received PMX-HP therapy. In addition, in 2017, Nakamura et al. [36] reported a significant positive effect of the PMX-HP therapy on survival outcome using the same dataset and propensity score matching. In their study, they used a different indicator for survival outcome (the odds ratio for hospital mortality) in the population different from that in the present study, making the comparison of the results of these two studies complicated. However, 38.9% of patients in the PMX-HP group after propensity score matching received ART-123, thus the effect of PMX-HP observed in the study by Nakamura et al. [36] might also have been influenced by this effect modification. Propensity score matching and other propensity score analyses can be useful to control biases in observational studies [44] ; however, the bias reducing capabilities of propensity scores may decrease when the propensity scores are estimated without considering interactions [45] .",

Although the predominant effect of PMX-HP is thought to be endotoxin removal, it has also been reported that PMX-HP traps activated leukocytes and platelets [28] . Activated blood cells are known to mediate the development of coagulopathy, which is followed by organ dysfunction and shock during sepsis. Iba et al. [46] suggested that the adsorption of such activated blood cells might be a therapeutic strategy against the complex mechanism of shock development during sepsis, in which the coagulation pathway plays an important role. Yamato et al. [39] reported efficacy for ART-123/PMX-HP combination therapy in patients with septic shock accompanied by DIC, suggesting that simultaneous control of high-mobility group box-1 protein, a late mediator of sepsis, through ART-123 and PMX-HP therapy might be a putative mechanism underpinning the beneficial effect. Although the present study could not reveal the detailed mechanism of the effect modification between ART-123 and PMX-HP treatments, our analysis of a large multicentre sample of 2350 patients supports the possibility of clinical efficacy of the combination reported by Yamato et al. We believe that in addition to the independent primary mechanisms of each therapy (anticoagulation and endotoxin removal), the simultaneous targeting of multiple mediators related to the development of organ dysfunction and shock in sepsis likely explains the effect modification between these therapies.",

Analysis of effect modifications is difficult to perform with a small sample size dataset, because the sample size of each variable evaluated for the effect modifications is smaller than overall sample size. In this study, ART-123 was administered to 720 patients [47] , whereas PMX-HP treatment was approved for the indication of severe Gram-negative bacterial infection in 1994 [27] . To the best of our knowledge, it is only in Japan that both these therapies can be used in general clinical setting. Thus, the nationwide dataset compiled in Japan, which comprised hundreds of patients who received unique treatments for sepsis, was useful for the evaluation of effect modification between these relatively novel approaches. It should be noted that numerous RCTs designed to evaluate the effects of each individual therapy in comparison to the standard of care [20-22, 25, 31-33] could not examine effect modifications between the novel treatments. This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective observational design is associated with a risk of unmeasured or unknown biases. Second, approximately a quarter of eligible patients were excluded because of missing data for some of the analysed variables. This selection process might also have introduced the risk of bias. However, there were several analysed variables that were not reported in over 10% of patients; therefore, we did not use the multiple imputation method. Third, the J-Septic DIC dataset is relatively old, and the definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock used in the dataset were proposed in 1991 [41] , whereas the current definitions of sepsis and septic shock were published in 2016 APACHE acute physiology and chronic health evaluation, DIC disseminated intravascular coagulation, ECMO extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ICU intensive care unit, JAAM Japanese Association for Acute Medicine, PMX-HP polymyxin B-immobilised haemoperfusion, RRT renal replacement therapy, SIRS systemic inflammatory response syndrome, SOFA sequential organ failure assessment Table 3 Adjusted hazard ratios of product terms between ART-123 and PMX-HP and related therapeutic variables",

Fourth, we used the JAAM-DIC score, which is predominantly used in Japan, and our conclusions might not extend to hospitals that use the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria [48] . However, we found that the JAAM-DIC score diagnosed most of the overt DIC cases, as do the ISTH criteria [42, 43, 49, 50] . In addition, 911 patients (28.5%) had missing data in variables necessary for the calculation of the ISTH criteria. Therefore, we reasoned that it would be difficult to use the ISTH score in the present study, as it would require adjustments to many factors in the Cox regression model. Fifth, in Japan, continuous intracircuit infusion of nafamostat mesylate (NM) may be used as an anticoagulant treatment during PMX-HP. Because the main effect of NM was significant in the Cox regression model used in the present study, there is a possibility that the results were affected by NM infusion during PMX-HP. However, no significant effect modification between ART-123 and NM treatments was observed (data not shown). Sixth, we did not evaluate simple main effects of ART-123 and PMX-HP, because the subgroups did not have adequate sample size to be evaluated by the Cox regression model used in the present study. Further studies will be needed to validate our findings; however, the results of the present study might help designing optimal RCTs to evaluate the effects of ART-123 and/or PMX-HP and impact clinical decision-making.",
