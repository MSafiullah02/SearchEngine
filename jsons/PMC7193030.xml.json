In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with SARS, only four studies provided conclusive data, all indicating higher mortality (6). One recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified ten observational studies investigating the administration of corticosteroids in 6,458 patients affected by influenza (7). The review identified increased mortality in patients who were given corticosteroids. Moreover, the length of stay in an intensive care unit was increased, as was the rate of secondary bacterial or fungal infection. Corticosteroids have also been investigated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in clinical trials in children with no conclusive evidence of benefit, and are therefore not recommended (8).",

(15) showed the group treated with corticosteroids experience a doubled risk of being admitted to an ICU, while in Ling et al. (14), the duration of viral RNA for oropharyngeal swabs and feces was almost doubled in corticosteroids group than controls. Liu et al. did not report any benefit of the use of intravenous methylprednisolone (30\u201380 mg/day) on clinical outcomes (i.e., short-term disease progression) in 137 participants (17). Finally, Wu et al. carried out their study among 201 participants with different stages of pneumonia due to COVID-19, and found that, in more severe forms (i.e., in subjects having ARDS due to COVID-19), the administration of standard doses of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the risk of death by 62% (16).",

When considering patients with SARS and MERS, the use of corticosteroids therapy is still debated (20, 21). Corticosteroids therapy was used in the treatment of severe SARS because early anecdotal experience supported it, and radiological findings, and histologic features of critically ill patients with SARS were similar to those of patients with ARDS (22, 23). In March 2003, China summarized its experience in the management of SARS, and suggested that high-dose glucocorticoids should be used if patients had a fever persisting for more than 3 days, or if radiologic findings were suggestive of persistent lung involvement or progressive deterioration (24). One systematic review of studies on patients with SARS-CoV, including 29 studies documenting glucocorticoid use, found 25 studies that were inconclusive regarding the role of the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids to standard therapy, and four studies demonstrated that the use of systemic glucocorticoids in SARS patients may cause possible harm (6). Moreover, a prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial compared early hydrocortisone treatment (before day seven of the illness) with a placebo and found that early hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load (25).",

The use of corticosteroids in patients presenting with ARDS of different etiologies remains controversial owing to mixed results in the existing literature, mainly derived from observational studies (27). Globally, high-dose glucocorticoids is among the most frequently used adjuncts in ARDS (17.9%) (28). Systemic corticosteroids have long been used among critically ill patients presenting with ARDS given their role in lowering the circulating levels of proinflammatory mediators (29, 30). Moreover, adequate and prolonged glucocorticoid supplementation have proved to mitigate the Critical Illness Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI), thus enhancing resolution of lung and systemic inflammation (31). One systematic review conducted an analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials, and found that, compared with the placebo group, prolonged glucocorticoid treatment improved clinical outcomes (32). A recent individual patient data meta-analysis combined four RCTs evaluating prolonged methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS and reported a significant reduction in mortality, with an increase in ventilator-free days (13 vs. 7, p < 0.001) (33).",
