Two of them had a history of fever at home. One totally afebrile child was hospitalized for stridor. The mean maximum temperature (\u00b1SD) for the 12 children who were febrile in the hospital was 39.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C, and the mean total duration of fever (\u00b1SD) for all children who were ever febrile was 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 days (range, 1\u20135 days). Most children presented with respiratory symptoms, although 1 child presented with febrile seizure without obvious respiratory infection (table 3). Chest radiography was performed for 8 patients, but all findings were normal. Five children (35%) had an alternative microbiologic diagnosis (influenza A H3N2 for 3 children, group AStreptococcus species isolated from a throat culture for 1 child with scarlet fever, andCampylobacter jejuni in the stool of a child with upper respiratory infection and diarrhea). One child with influenza A and HCoV-NL63 coinfection also hadEscherichia coli urinary tract infection. The 11 children who had HCoV-NL63 as the sole cause of infection and the patient with diarrhea who had respiratory symptoms not explained byC. jejuni infection were compared with age-matched children with influenza A or RSV infection. Children admitted for influenza A had a longer mean duration of fever than did those infected with HCoV-NL63 (table 4). Children with HCoV-NL63 infection were less likely than those with RSV infection to have lower respiratory involvement (9% vs. 63.6%;P = .02).",

In addition to causing upper respiratory disease, we found that HCoV-NL63 infection can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, and febrile seizures. The peak age for hospitalization with HCoV-NL63 infection was 2\u20133 years, which is similar to that for HCoV-OC43 infection. In comparison, the mean ages (\u00b1SD) of children admitted to the hospital with influenza, hMPV infection, and RSV infection in the same cohort were 30.2 \u00b1 22.6, 31.7 \u00b1 18.7, and 19.5 \u00b1 17.2 months, respectively [4]. In contrast to an earlier report, the majority of children with HCoV-NL63 infection in our study had no major underlying disorders [3]. A coinfecting pathogen was identified in 5 of the 15 children. The child withC. jejuni diarrhea also had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection that were not explained by the bacterial infection but were probably attributable to HCoV-NL63. In the other 4 children, the coinfecting pathogen could fully explain the clinical presentation, and it is difficult to comment on the contribution of HCoV-NL63. When age-matched children with influenza A or RSV infection and HCoV-NL63 infection were compared, children with HCoV-NL63 infection had a shorter duration of fever than did those with influenza A, and they were less likely to have lower respiratory tract involvement than were those with RSV infection. The duration of hospitalization seemed to be equivalent for all 3 infections. Rapid virological diagnosis of RSV infection and influenza were available to clinicians, but diagnosis of HCoV-NL63 infection was retrospective. Availability of rapid diagnosis has been shown to result in shorter hospital stay [7].",

The viral load appears to correlate inversely with time after onset of clinical symptoms, withr = -0.8 (by Pearson Correlation coefficient). The equation log10 (viral load) = -1.09 (day) + 4.96 was found to predict HCoV-NL63 load in the NPA specimen in relation to symptom onset.",
