Because this new coronavirus (CoV) genetically approximates the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV]), the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses termed this new virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated human illness as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1 On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared this global health emergency a pandemic.2,3",

During initial ICU stay, basic opioid sparing is necessary, for example, using \u03b12 agonists to prevent opioid dependence after ICU discharge.15 Other preventive measures include early physical rehabilitation to maintain full range of motion of joints and to mitigate against muscle atrophy, virtual reality to distract patients from pain, and music therapy to improve the endogenous opioid system.15 After discharge from hospital, ARDS survivors must be tracked to ensure that an integrated cognitive therapy plan is instituted for PTSD with medications for depression and sleep disturbances.",
