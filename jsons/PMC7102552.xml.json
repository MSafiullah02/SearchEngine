Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process to eliminate pathogens [1]. This catabolic process sequesters cytosolic components including misfolded proteins, injured organelles, and intracellular pathogens through a lysosome-dependent pathway [2]. Accumulated evidence shows that successful pathogens can hijack autophagy for their own replication [3]. This review focuses on a chronic gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, which often inhabits mucosal layers and causes dyspeptic symptoms of varying severity. Findings of previous studies indicate that autophagy plays an important role in host defense, lessening H. pylori burden [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. However, H. pylori is a facultative intracellular pathogen and is capable of invading and surviving not only in non-phagocytic cells but also in professional phagocytes [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. In addition, H. pylori is detected in double-layered autophagosomes, indicating that autophagosomes serve as a peculiar niche for H. pylori multiplication to sustain intracellular infections [8,12,13]. However, the underlying mechanisms through which H. pylori coopts the autophagy machinery to affect bacterial clearance efficiency in host cells remain to be elucidated.",

Genomic analysis reveals that H pylori contains more than 30 outer membrane protein (omp) genes including the Helicobacter OMPs (Hop) and the hop-related group (hor) [15]. The two most important adhesins in H. pylori are Lewis b (Leb) blood group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA) and sialyl Lewis X antigen-binding adhesin (SabA), and both these adhesins are Hop proteins [[16], [17], [18]]. Thus, the host and pathogen interact partly through the binding of adhesins to specific carbohydrate moieties of the gastric epithelium, promoting infection and inflammatory processes in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Purification and subsequent studies on this unique toxin showed that VacA is synthesized as a 140-kDa polypeptide precursor, which undergoes trimming to yield a mature 95-kDa toxin and is secreted via an auto-transporter encoded in its C-terminal domain [[20], [21], [22]]. It can assemble into water-soluble oligomeric forms including a single layer structure consisting of hexamers/heptamers and a double-layered assembly [23]. It is interesting that VacA disassembles at acidic pH, interacts with the lipid membrane and reassembles into a pore-forming hexameric structure in membranes, enabling the transport of chloride ions [22,24]. This unique channel-formation activity contributes to vacuolation in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments as well as increases in mitochondrial membrane permeability which leads to cytochrome c release [22,23].",

Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase \u03b2 (RPTP\u03b2) binds to VacA through its terminal sialic acid domain in gastric epithelial cells [25,26]. RPTP\u03b1 also serves as a functional VacA receptor in human kidney tumor cell G401 that lacks RPTP\u03b2 [27]. The interaction of VacA and RPTP\u03b1 activates Src phosphorylation, resulting in CagA phosphorylation at Tyr972 in AZ-521 cells [28]. Notably, VacA is able to target the membrane of multiple cell types including gastric epithelial cells, T cells, and parietal cells. Therefore, VacA with high pore-forming activity is associated with increased disease severity [29]. It has been described that removing the membrane-associated region of VacA blocks its vacuolating activity and prevents VacA from integrating into the inner-mitochondrial membrane [30]. Recent evidence also shows that VacA binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and is involved in triggering autophagy as discussed below [31].",

The mechanisms that pathogens have exploited in order to introduce the virulence factors into the host cells. In another study conducted, H. pylori cag-T4SS interacts with the \u03b21 integrin of the host cells in an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-independent manner, which initiates effector protein translocation [33]. When H. pylori contacts with the host membrane, CagA interacts with the externalized phosphatidylserine to facilitate its entry into target cells, which is important for the pathophysiological activity of CagA [34]. In addition to \u03b21 integrin, a recent study by K\u00f6niger et. al. describes that HopQ specifically interacts with human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family (CEACAMs), facilitating CagA translocation into host cells [35]. These studies suggest that H. pylori exploits multiple ways to exert CagA translocation into the host cells. The translocated CagA can be phosphorylated and interacted with several host signaling proteins, thus interfering with host cell signaling [36]. It is known that CagA translocation and phosphorylation are mediated through cholesterol-rich microdomains present on the cytoplasm membrane (also referred as lipid rafts) [34,[37], [38], [39]]. Lipid rafts are important for efficient T4SS-mediated CagA translocation, inducing an elevated level of the cell hummingbird phenotype and increased IL-8 production [37]. The host membrane lipid phosphatidylserine plays a crucial role in CagA delivery and localization [34,40]. Moreover, simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which reduces the level of cellular cholesterol and decreases translocation and phosphorylation of CagA, indicating that cholesterol is crucial for CagA-mediated actions [39].",

            "text": "The O-Glycans of the human gastric mucosa diminish the levels of H. pylori infection by inhibiting the bacterial cholesterol-modifying enzyme, cholesterol-\u03b1-glucosyltransferase (CGT) encoded by the type 1 capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis protein J (capJ) [41]. CGT catalyzes the conversion of host cholesterol into cholesteryl-\u03b1-glucoside (\u03b1CG) [41]. Further modification of \u03b1CG yields cholesteryl-6\u2032-O-acyl-\u03b1-glucoside, cholesteryl-6\u2032-O-phosphatidyl-\u03b1-glucoside, and cholesteryl-6\u2032-O-lysophosphatidyl-\u03b1-glucoside, which constitute a large proportion of the glycolipids in the cell wall [41]. Cholesterol glucosylation of H. pylori by CGT, interestingly, promotes H. pylori evasion of immune defenses [42]. We have previously shown that knockout of capJ (\u0394CapJ), which abolishes the production of cholesteryl glucosides (CGs), greatly decreases the degree of T4SS-induced activities, including CagA translocation/phosphorylation, subsequent signaling events, the scattering hummingbird morphology in AGS cells, and IL-8 secretion [43]. This is mainly because CGs of the wild-type H. pylori-infected AGS cells are essential for reorganizing the lipid-raft membranes for efficient T4SS function [43]. Furthermore, cholesterol-glucosylated H. pylori is largely internalized via a lipid-raft-dependent pathway, which delays the maturation of phagosomes and facilitates the evasion of macrophages [44], suggesting a role in interfering with autophagy, which is discussed in a later section [45]. H. pylori harboring CGT, inhibits interferon gamma-induced signaling, which avoids host inflammatory responses [46]. Noticeably, CGs also contribute to cell wall integrity, morphology, and antibiotic resistance [47]. Collectively, these findings highlight the multiple strategies employed by H. pylori for persistent colonization.",

The increased levels of ammonia from hydrolysis of urea by urease as well as the metabolites from recruited neutrophils disrupts the gastric epithelium, which synergistically facilitates the development of gastric malignancies [49,50]. In addition, H. pylori possesses four to eight unipolar flagella that are important in bacterial colonization and induce inflammatory response [51]. The flagellar sheath of H. pylori provides the protection of acid-labile flagellar structure from the attack of the acid environment [52]. Additionally, H. pylori harbors two main heat-shock proteins, GroES-like HspA (Hsp10), and GroEL-like HspB (Hsp60). The regulation of heat-shock proteins expression by H. pylori is crucial for bacteria to adapt and survive in the hostile environment of the stomach [53].",

The three major forms of autophagy include microautophagy, macroautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy [55,56]. Microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy are directly recruited to a lysosome, which engulfs small portions of cytosol and receives chaperone-associated cargo [57]. Macroautophagy can sequester cytosolic molecules, including damaged organelles or pathogens, in the autophagosome [57]. In mammalian cells, macroautophagy occurs in the cytoplasm; the organelles are surrounded by a phagophore or cytoplasmic double-membrane-bound structure, which start growing at both ends to create an autophagosome [58,59]. The autophagosome subsequently fuses with a lysosome, forming a single, large, and membrane-surrounded vesicle (autophagolysosome); both the membrane and its contents are then degraded by lytic enzymes [60,61]. Autophagy has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in biological processes, such as cell protection, response to starvation, recycling nutrients from digested organelles and macromolecules by removing damaged organelles and aberrantly folded proteins, diseases, and host defenses [62].",

Therefore, the interplay between the initial entry of these pathogenic microbes into the host cells and the response of the host cells plays a critical role in determining the fate of the microbes. Wang and Hajishengallis previously reported that Porphyromonas gingivalis relies on the lipid rafts of the macrophages to enhance its intracellular bacterial load and survival [64]. There is mounting evidence that shows parasites [[65], [66], [67]], viruses [68,69], and prions [70,71] target the lipid rafts of the host cells, which benefits infections. Lipids cluster together to form microdomains in cell membranes, i.e., lipid rafts. Lipid rafts composed of high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids [72], that modulate a wide array of cellular processes such as signal transduction [73], membrane trafficking [74,75], and cytoskeletal organization [76,77].",

Salmonella secretes secretor effector protein (SifA) via its type 3 secretion system (T3SS) from the Salmonella-containing vacuoles to the cytoplasm [87]. SifA then binds to kinesin-interacting protein (SKIP), a host protein, which downregulates the recruitment of kinesin to the bacterial vacuoles, thereby promoting the membrane dynamics of vacuoles [88]. Upon invading the host cells, a few pathogens escape from the vacuoles and replicate in the host cytoplasm. These pathogens express factors that initiate the process of actin polymerization, facilitating their propagation in the cells. For example, L. monocytogenes secretes the virulence factor listeriolysin O (Llo), a pore-forming exotoxin which degrades the membrane of internalized vacuoles in the infected host cells [89], eventually resulting in vacuolar dissolution, and thereby promoting intracellular survival [90]. Furthermore, the pathogen is able to translocate across the infected cell wall to spread and invade adjacent cells through actin-based motility [91]. This phenomenon is attributable to the presence of the protein actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA) on the bacterial surface. ActA acts as a nucleator, which induces actin polymerization allowing the bacteria to move forward in the host cells [92].",

One example is M. tuberculosis, which produces a phosphatase identified as secreted acid phosphatase (SapM). SapM is capable of converting PI(3)P to PI, inhibiting late phagosome endosome fusion which in turn inhibits phagosomal maturation [93]. Another example is Salmonella enterica, which injects effector sigma D factor (SigD) into host cells, leading to the modulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (VPs34) and increasing vacuolar PI(3)P, thereby averting phagosome maturation and preventing fusion with a lysosome [94].",

Recently, another survival strategy employed by the pathogen has been discovered. While employing this strategy, the pathogen directly interferes with the maturation of the autolysosome.

            "text": "Several virulence factors and host genes have been shown to affect H. pylori-induced autophagy (Table 2\n). Of these, VacA was first reported by Terebiznik et al. to induce autophagy in the AGS cell line [101]. H. pylori infection of AGS cells increases LC3 puncta and promotes the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Moreover, formation of LC3 puncta was decreased in atg5\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) challenged with H. pylori, indicating that H. pylori-induced autophagy in AGS cells follows the canonical pathway [101]. Treatment of AGS cells with purified toxin or conditioned culture media supernatants revealed that VacA but not CagA, CagE, urease, or the T4SS is essential and sufficient to induce autophagy [101]. In contrast, another study using AZ-521 cells found that treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a PtdIns3K inhibitor, or knockdown of BECN1 did not inhibit VacA-induced autophagy, suggesting that it does not use the canonical pathway [31]. This finding contradicts the results in AGS cells reported by Tang et al. [102], possibly due to the different cell lines used. Interestingly, autophagy in turns modulates the activity of intracellular VacA, indicating that autophagy protects host cells against H. pylori infection. However, the mechanism by which these virulence factors induce autophagy remains to be investigated. One clue is that VacA damages mitochondrial function and causes nutrient depletion which may be linked to inhibition of mTOR signaling and induction of autophagy [107].",

Raju et. al. showed that prolonged exposure (24 h) to a toxin disrupts subsequent autophagosome-lysosome fusion and causes the accumulation of autophagsomes in the cells [108]. This observation suggests that the underlying mechanisms of autophagy are not the same in acute and chronic exposure (Fig. 2\n). The final step of autophagy is formation of autolysosomes, which are the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. For instance, after prolonged exposure to conditioned culture media, AGS cells show a reduced level of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D, due to disruption of lysosome acidification [108]. The defective autophagosomes in AGS cells caused by VacA may lead to the accumulation of SQSTM1, a major cargo ubiquitin-binding receptor. This phenomenon is also observed in patient biopsies [108]. Other reports also showed the accumulation of different proteins due to VacA-disrupted autophagy, leading to changes in cellular ROS levels [109] and gene mutations [110]. The accumulation of p62 activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) which controls the expression of ROS detoxification genes in AGS cells [108,110]. A contradictory result showed that CagA and HspB, but not VacA, regulate the antioxidant response [111]. Therefore, a detailed investigation of the effect of p62 and NRF2 on H. pylori virulence factors that regulate autophagy is warranted.",

Interestingly, s1m1 VacA, but not s1m2 or s2m2 interacts with LRP1 and stimulates autophagy [31]. Moreover, knockdown of LRP1 significantly reduces autophagy, indicating that VacA internalization is crucial for the induction of autophagy. Internalized VacA may further alter the membrane permeability of mitochondria, causing the release of cytochrome c and leading to the induction of mitophagy and apoptosis [29,111]. In addition, the internalization of H. pylori is unaffected by VacA and CagA, but is correlated with H. pylori invasin NudA in AGS cells [112]. Notably, the internalization of H. pylori also requires the activation of PI3-kinase and PKC in AGS cells [105].",

H. pylori infection may increase the expression of MIR30B in different gastric cell lines (i.e. MIR30D in AGS and GES1 cells). Both MIR30B and MIR30D target several genes involved in autophagy, such as ATG12 and BECN1. Interestingly, a very recent report by Tsugawa et al. showed that overexpression of capping actin protein of muscle Z-line alpha subunit 1 (CAPZA1) blocks the CagA-degraded autophagy by downregulating the expression of lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in H. pylori-infected cells [113]. Moreover, Tsugawa et al. showed that CagA accumulation in CAPZA1-overexpressing cells is essential for the upregulation of CD44v9 which is a cancer stem-cell marker, suggesting that overexpression of CAPZA1 could be a key risk factor in gastric cancer development [114]. This notion is supported by an earlier study that the abundance of CD44v9 is a superior prognostic predictor than the presence of open-type gastric mucosal atrophy for the recurrence of gastric cancer in patients after the resection of early gastric cancer [115]. These lines of evidence together suggest that H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa exhibits negative regulation of autophagy through an orchestrated array of actions from multiple virulence factors. As such, H. pylori-mediated defective autophagy links to an increased gastric cancer risk, thereby promoting the development of various gastrointestinal diseases.",

This study also demonstrated that ATG12 is involved in the autophagy pathway, which is essential for H. pylori intracellular survival [45].

For instance, several gene polymorphisms are associated with Crohn disease, an inflammatory bowel disorder, which affects H. pylori induced autophagy. ATG16L1, which is involved in autophagosome formation with the T300A mutation makes host more susceptible to H. pylori infection and reduces H. pylori-induced autophagy [108]. However, the detailed underlying mechanism remains to be explored. Another gene involved in this autophagy is the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a pattern recognition receptor. During H. pylori infection, NOD2 activates nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling which induces inflammation. However, the R702W mutant cannot activate NF-\u03baB signaling [118]. Therefore, the mutation is associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, which is usually associated with H. pylori infection [118]. In addition to NOD2, TLR4, a pattern recognition receptor, also plays an important role in stimulating macrophage autophagy by binding to lipopolysaccharides on the bacteria [7,45]. TLR4 polymorphisms have been shown to correlate with gastric cancer [116]. However, further experiments are needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms.",

            "text": "Autophagy is increasingly recognized as a vital route for host defense. Thus, it is not surprising that successful intracellular pathogens are evolved to dysregulate autophagy, contributing to disease pathogenesis. H. pylori, a small pathogen, shows remarkable capabilities to enhance its intracellular survival and propagation by means of a limited number of virulence factors, exemplified by multiple strategies that have evolved to negatively regulate autophagy. This, in turn, increases the risk of developing H. pylori-associated diseases. However, there are discrepancies in the results obtained to date, mainly due to the different types of cell models and/or bacterial strains used. Furthermore, the connection between virulence factors, dysregulated intracellular trafficking, disease etiology and its clinical relevance remains largely unanswered. For instance, does CagA, VacA, or CGT mediate membrane remodeling and interfere with intracellular trafficking, and how does this relate to a defective autophagy? Although VacA-induced autophagy is dependent on LRP1, the detailed mechanisms and signaling underlying the autophagic trafficking remains to be clarified. Negative regulation of autophagy in H. pylori-infected gastric biopsies harboring abundance of CAPZA1, accumulation of CagA, and expression of CD44v9 is considered to increase gastric cancer risk. It will be of interest to characterize CagA accumulation in CD44v9-negative gastric epithelial cells. It is important to examine these data using cell models, in vivo studies, and in clinical settings. Further investigations are required to provide a mechanistic basis for better understanding the host-pathogen interplay in the context of autophagy and disease progression. This may facilitate the development of new strategies for combating diseases affected by infection and autophagy.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is capable of surviving in the phagosome after being internalized into the host cell by preventing phagosomal maturation and inhibiting autophagosome fusion with lysosome. M. tuberculosis is able to survive and replicate in the phagosome. However, cytosolic translocation of M. tuberculosis can occur when it expresses the early secretory antigenic target of M. tuberculosis (ESAT-6) secretion system (ESX-1) and type VII secretion system (TSSS). Listeria monocytogenes employs various virulence factors in its escape from autophagy. Upon escaping from the phagosome using its pore forming toxin (Listeriolysin O), L. monocytogenes expresses another virulence factor ActA to inhibit the recruitment of p62 and NDP52 to its surface. Another group of virulence factors, two phospholipases C (PlcA/B) then prevent the formation of the autophagosomal membrane. In Legionella infections, L. pneumophila escapes from the vacuole and enters the host\u2019s cytosol via LepB using a type IV secretion system. The cytosolic L. pneumophila is subsequently recognized by the autophagic machinery but delays phagocytosis by using its effector protein RavZ. In the autophagosome L. pneumophila also delays the fusion of the autophagosome with lysosome to allow it time to develop into an acid-resistant form. This acid-resistant form of L. pneumophila can then replicate in the acidic autophagolysosome.",

The initiation of infection starts with the internalization of H. pylori and VacA, the formation of VacA pores or the binding of VacA to LRP1. The internalization of H. pylori and VacA may induce autophagy. VacA forms pores in the mitochondria, causing nutrient depletion which induces autophagy, mediated through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Autophagy may proceed through either the canonical or non-canonical pathway depending on the cell lines used. In addition to inducing autophagy, H. pylori can hijack the autophagy process. H. pylori infection may induce the expression of MIR30B and MIR30D, which subsequently inhibit autophagy by targeting different autophagy-related genes. Also, the acidification of lysosome is disrupted by chronic exposure to VacA, causing the accumulation of pro-cathepsin D. These mechanisms allow H. pylori to survive and replicate in the autophagosome.",

The disrupted lipid rafts result in a lower internalization of H. pylori and interfere with autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. Another study has shown that H. pylori infection may increase the expression of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II).
