Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to construction of VLPs, making them attractive as possible nanocarriers (Carrico et al., 2008, Kovacs et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2005). Combining a good safety profile with strong immunogenicity, VLPs are expected to gain widespread use in numerous fields, such as in vitro diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutic modalities.",

First, MS2 VLPs can offer effective, convenient ways to package and deliver RNAs or DNAs, epitope peptides, and drugs within bacteriophage capsids (Sun et al., 2011, Wei et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2015a, Zhang et al., 2015b). Second, they can have excellent adjuvant properties and thus induce innate and cognate immune responses. Additionally, they are safer and more effective than traditional vaccines derived from attenuated or inactivated infectious viral strains. Furthermore, they are capable of tissue-specific targeting after modification with a ligand, and this feature can ensure that the targeted agents carried by MS2 VLPs are more effective.",

            "text": "Clinical applications of MS2 VLPs are perhaps their most exciting feature. Their main applications belong to the field of vaccine development. A series of research findings showed that an MS2 VLP-based vaccine can effectively induce innate and cognate immune responses and can be used as a specific preventive intervention in some diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (Bittle et al., 1982, Dong et al., 2015, Van Lierop et al., 1992, Wong et al., 2000), prostate cancer (Li et al., 2014), and illnesses caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) (Tumban et al., 2012). Another important application of MS2 VLPs is therapeutic modalities because these particles can deliver drugs or biologics to a specific tissue (Ashley et al., 2011, Pan et al., 2012a, Yao et al., 2015). Moreover, by packaging specific RNA molecules into the recombinant MS2VLPs, researchers can construct so-called armored RNAs. Because their structure is similar to that of the native virus and their concentration is already calibrated, the armored RNAs can be used as \u201cstandards\u201d or \u201ccalibrators\u201d for detection of the corresponding native viruses and for validation of an experiment with the help of a \u201ccontrol\u201d (Das et al., 2006, Zhan et al., 2009). Our objective here is to review the novel delivery platform based on Bacteriophage MS2 VLPs, including introduction to their structure, their potential as a delivery platform, and their expected use in medicine and other fields.",

The FG loops of the B conformation of CP surround the fivefold vertices of the icosahedron, and the A and C conformations interdigitate at the threefold vertices of the icosahedron, thus forming an icosahedron of 60 A/B dimers and 30 C/C dimers (Golmohammadi et al., 1993, Valeg\u00e5rd et al., 1990).

(1994) reported that the assembly of this bacteriophage can be achieved via interaction between the bacteriophage CP and a 19-nucleotide sequence-specific MS2cistron, the so-called pac site. That is to say, the MS2 RNA genome has a special functional structure when encapsidated inside the virus particle. Borodavka et al. (2012) and Rolfsson et al. (2010) showed that CPs and RNA act as mutual chaperones by altering each other\u2019s conformation because of formation of the complex in a context-specific way, as the capsid shell grows from an initiation complex. Toropova et al., 2008, Toropova et al., 2011 reported that 90% of the encapsidated RNA is well ordered and forms two layers inside the icosahedral viral particle. Dykeman et al. (2011) stated that the symmetry of the icosahedron and the locations of the RNA hairpins in the A/B dimers point to possible assembly mechanisms for aseries of hairpins in the MS2 genome. Thus, according to the above findings, the CP-binding RNA hairpins may play an important role in the assembly of the virus particle with the correct size and symmetry (Basnak et al., 2010, Koning et al., 2003, Morton et al., 2010, Stockley et al., 2007).",

The final covalent CP dimer (CCPD) gene encoded 257 amino acid residues. The CCPD molecules were then found to assemble into VLPs. These particles are indistinguishable from the VLPs assembled from the wild-type CP at the resolution of an electron microscope. Another study showed that both wild-type and the CCPD particles are more stable than the dimers of the wild-type subunits (Peabody, 1997, Peabody and Lim, 1996), even though they appear to have a similar diameter: 280 \u00b1 20 \u00c5 (Plevka et al., 2008).",

Nevertheless, these approaches do not offer a perfect carrier for delivery. First, the greatest challenge is still the relative instability of mRNA owing to degradation by prevalent RNases. Besides, the high costs of gold particles and the gene gun with inconvenient settings for administration to experimental animals hinder the development of ballistic delivery of mRNA for vaccination. Furthermore, in vitro mRNA-transfected DCs have been used for cancer treatment in the clinic and turned out to be expensive (Van Lint et al., 2013), let alone the scarcity of the source of autologous DCs. All of these disadvantages hamper practical applications and development of mRNA vaccines. Thus, there is a high demand for a simple, safe, efficient, stable, and inexpensive method for the delivery of mRNA.",

As a nonviral delivery system, MS2 VLPs can be designed to deliver an epitope peptide for clinical purposes. First, after insertion of a DNA oligonucleotide into a unique site of the MS2CP gene, MS2 VLPs can present the epitope peptide to the immune system (Mastico et al., 1993, Peabody et al., 2008, Wei et al., 2008). It is, of course, not difficult to elicit a desired antibody response by a specific epitope peptide (Meloen et al., 2000, Partidos and Steward, 2002). Furthermore, VLPs can present viral antigens as dense repetitive arrays, which are known to be highly stimulatory to immunocytes (Bachmann et al., 1993, Milich et al., 1997). Additionally, compared to other VLP platforms MS2 VLPs are advantageous because of their good stability and proper size for effective presentation of viral antigens (Bundy et al., 2008). When MS2 VLPs are used as a platform for the presentation of epitopes, in the majority of cases, this approach is implemented through modification of the VLP gene sequence, so that fusion proteins of VLP components with the foreign epitope are assembled into VLPs during the expression of these proteins.",

A number of approaches to miRNA delivery involving the use of viral or nonviral vector systems have also been explored (Davidson and McCray, 2011). Nonetheless, the typically low transduction efficiency, possible cytotoxicity, and integration-induced tumorigenesis are always concerns when plasmid or viral vectors are used for miRNA expression (Davidson and McCray, 2011).

In this study they also demonstrated that miR-146a levels in mice, after delivery via MS2VLPs, first significantly increase, and then this miRNA exerts its therapeutic action on lupus-prone mice via inhibition of production of a pathogenic autoantibody. In other words, this treatment with MS2-miR146a VLP can have profound effects on lupus-prone BXSB mice by upregulating mature miR-146a, which causes significant downregulation of autoantibodies, of total IgG, and of proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6.

Nevertheless, Zhan et al. (2009) constructed a long armored RNA containing a 3034-base exogenous RNA, which can be used for detection of HIV-1 in a one-plasmid double-expression system. It is completely resistant to RNases, remains stable in normal human EDTA-preserved plasma at 4 \u00b0C for at least 6 months, and yields reproducible linear results in the Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay.",

It should be noted that when a large protein domain serves as an antigen, it may pose difficulty for display on MS2VLPs because such an insertion may disrupt the VLP assembly. In that case, chemical conjugation may be a solution. Another problem with the delivery of RNA within MS2 VLPs is that these VLPs are immunogenic, and antibody responses to the particles may interfere with the delivery to the intended destination.",

Thus, MS2 VLPs possess extensive prospects for practical applications. The most promising applications of MS2VLPs are vaccine development and therapeutic modalities.

The middle panel depicts surface representation of Bacteriophage MS2: a crystal structure of in vitro assembled MS2 coat protein (CP) with synthetic RNA hairpins. A/B dimers are blue and green. C/C dimers are purple. The right panel depicts an electron-microscopy image of wild-type MS2. The scale bar is 100 nm. (B) Structures of the A/B and C/C dimers. The FG loop (highlighted) exists in an extended conformation in the A and C subunits but is bent back toward the core of the protein in B subunits. Sixty A/B dimers and 30C/C dimers assemble into the icosahedron of MS2. (C) Genetic map of the MS2 genome. The genome of Bacteriophage MS2encodes four proteins: CP (the major protein), the maturation protein (A-protein), the replicase (an RNA polymerase necessary for genome multiplication), and the lysis protein.

After being packaged into MS2 VLPs, an mRNA-based vaccine can easily stimulate the immune system and serve as an effective vaccine. (B) Delivery of peptides. Exogenous peptides can be easily recombined with MS2VLPs via genetic engineering, and the chimeric VLPs are strongly immunogenic when carrying either B- or T-cell epitopes. (C) Delivery of miRNAs. miRNAs perform powerful gene-regulatory functions in many diseases. As a novel attractive delivery system, MS2 VLPs bonded with miRNAs can be applied to gene therapy. (D) Delivery of drugs. MS2VLPs possess several features that make them attractive as potential nanocarriers for passive and targeted drug delivery and can be effective against certain diseases (in animal models).
