This transformation is expansive and most obvious in the changes that has been occurring over the past fifty years in the provisioning of healthcare services [2]. The dependence of health, rehabilitation, and wellness programs on technology for the delivery of services has never been greater [3]. Therefore, it is essential that health technology (HT) be strategically guided and optimally managed [4]. Guidance can only be provided by educated and experienced professionals who can safely lead the full life cycle of the technology, starting with innovation and progressing to development, regulatory compliance, evaluation, installation, training, integration, performance assurance, and risk mitigation. However, these professionals must be familiar with the relationship between contributions from HT and their impact on patient outcomes. The understanding of this relationship is a fundamental requirement for achieving optimal return on investment and improvement of outcomes. Such practitioners are critical members of the healthcare team and should be in position to facilitate technology-related plans.",

The flood of scientific and technological innovation is radically redefining the nature of healthcare in virtually every dimension, from vascular nano-engineered interventions and predictive diagnostic tests to image guided surgery and remote telehealth-based services at the national and global levels. However, most healthcare systems are not adequately staffed to safely and effectively manage these forces of change. Most systems are structured around vertically-expert professions (medical doctors, medical physicists, nurses, administrators), but lack the \u201chorizontal expertise\u201d that trained Biomedical and Clinical Engineers (BE&CE) provide. For example, the expertise in assessing and managing the integration and the performance of complex smart systems that have varying areas of service, durations of technological lifecycle [5], hardware and software platforms, and middleware in support of integrated medical and surgical services.",

This allowed us to answer the question whether their participation contributed to improvement in overall healthcare outcomes. In the field of HT management and CE, the incentives to publish studies are lower than it should be, resulting in limited volume of resources to develop best practice measures. Despite these perceived limitations, our results were recently published [3].

Our data answers these concerns. If the knowledge and the expertise of the global CE community does have a critical role in optimal guidance of HT deployment, how can that expertise be best demonstrated. The collection of the case studies (that were later called success stories) from all over the world can facilitate the determination if there is competency unique to CEs around the world that leads the development and optimal management of these technology life cycles.

Low resources countries in particular face a challenge of improving their health services because, in addition to the above stated challenges, they also have scarce availability of professional expertise trained to address technology-related issues [7]. Varied availability and state of infrastructure and human resources place higher demand on adequate management of HT innovation and deployment. The effective health workforce of the twenty-first century consists of more individual practitioners caring for complex health-issues and thus charged with deploying the most optimal benefits from medical technology, such as proper selection, effectiveness, timely access, and affordable. In academia, government, and industry, teams of BE&CE translate design innovations and integrate knowledge of science, engineering, standards and regulations with clinical strategy to create new tools that save and improve lives while building more quality into patient outcomes. In hospitals, BE&CE practitioners ensure that proper acquisition, installation, integration and operation of devices and systems are safe and efficient.
