Data available from one centre alone over the same period a year previously revealed 488 cases referred by A&E. This is likely to be due to reluctance of people attending hospitals due to COVID-19, and reduction in the incidence of trauma as most people stayed at home. The proportion of injuries sustained at home was significantly higher than injuries sustained outside of home. However, the gap began to reduce towards the end of the lockdown as the overall number of cases also rose. The sharp reduction in the number of cases triggered rota changes in some centres, allocating reduced number of doctors in on-call duties, freeing up members of the team to either remain at home or be redeployed to other duties (Fig. 1\n).",

It was not possible to compare directly the figures of domestic violence and self harm seen in our study to previous figures, however it may be fair to suggest that we may have seen a higher proportion of such cases during the study period. The cases we encountered included a shotgun suicide attempt and assaults by partners, all of which resulted in severe injuries. There is a need for the government to invest in the support systems for the victims of domestic violence and those with mental health issues during the pandemic (Fig. 2\n).",

All clinicians who undertook surgical intervention within the oral cavity utilised the appropriate PPE including FFP3 masks. There was a varying use of PPE for examination only and extra-oral surgery, however there was no evidence to suggest inadequate protection (See Fig. 3\n). It was interesting to note that not a single patient was known COVID-19 positive at the time of their presentation, and remained disease free during their inpatient stay. The vast majority of the patients had an unknown COVID-19 status, however were treated as if they were asymptomatic carriers of the infection (see Table 1, Table 2).",

A domestic violence case of severe panfacial fractures was treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of parasymphyseal mandible fracture, however the midface fractures were managed conservatively. Such cases would have required extended operating times with the use of PPE, and there may have been reluctance in undertaking surgical intervention with high risk of aerosol generation. When ORIF were undertaken, some clinicians implemented steps to try and minimise the aerosol generated by keeping the drill underwater when entering screw holes or using lubricant such as Instillagel or Aquagel instead of water irrigation.",

Of those patients who attended the hospitals, the assessing clinicians felt that nearly one-fifth could have been managed purely by remote consultation.

The significant reduction in the emergency workload may allow for members of the team to be redeployed to other duties in the hospital. There may be a scope for merging emergency service with other units to allow for cross-cover if one particular hospital were to be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients and unable to safely run a service.
