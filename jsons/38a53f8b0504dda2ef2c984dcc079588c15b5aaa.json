Some have proposed possible transmission during the incubation period [4] . The suggestion that the incubation period can be extended beyond fourteen days is receiving support [5] . Although it is more common for the incubation period to be less than one week, 97 to 99% confidence intervals for the tail-end of excretion are more than double the latter timing. If the majority of patients become ill in less than two weeks, the finding of outliers beyond the latter may not be common in a small affected population. To the contrary, a very large population being affected is very likely to have such outliers which could complicate the pattern of spread.",

Extension to the quarantine period for a patient with a laboratory-confirmed infection or for a definitive close contact should be considered.

In these uncertain times, given the crescendo to a global pandemic and given the observed morbidity, some further consideration should be given to these very important epidemiological topics.
