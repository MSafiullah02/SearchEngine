            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-21 is a pleiotropic type I cytokine secreted by multiple CD4 T cell subsets, including follicular helper T cells (TFH), T helper 17 (TH17) and natural killer (NK) T cells (Yi et al., 2010a). It acts as a co-mitogen to drive CD8 T cell activation, expansion, differentiation and/or survival (Zeng et al., 2005, Casey and Mescher, 2007, Ostiguy et al., 2007, Elsaesser et al., 2009, Frohlich et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009, Barker et al., 2010, Novy et al., 2011) and is a critical regulator of humoral immunity (Ozaki et al., 2002, Linterman et al., 2010, Zotos et al., 2010, Rankin et al., 2011). The IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) is expressed on several cell types, including T, B, NK cells, and NK T lymphocytes, as well as dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Yi et al., 2010a) and consists of an IL-21 binding protein and the common cytokine receptor \u03b3-chain, which is shared by the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15 (Rochman et al., 2009). During peripheral viral infections IL-21 plays a beneficial role by supporting multiple CD8 T cell functions, survival and generation of long-lived memory (Barker et al., 2010, Novy et al., 2011, Pallikkuth et al., 2012). IL-21 deficiency during chronic infection induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results in impaired long-term CD8 T cell functionality, enhanced CD8 T cell exhaustion, and viral persistence (Elsaesser et al., 2009, Frohlich et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009). IL-21 also influences long-lived humoral responses during peripheral viral infections including LCMV, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus infection (Elsaesser et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009, Rasheed et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The role of IL-21 during neuroinflammatory diseases is relatively unexplored. In multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica elevated cerebrospinal fluid IL-21 levels and polymorphisms in the IL-21R gene implicate IL-21 in autoimmune pathogenesis (Nohra et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2012). In white matter MS lesions IL-21 expression is primarily restricted to CD4 T cells, while IL-21R is predominantly detected on T and B lymphocytes, and sparsely on cortical neurons (Tzartos et al., 2011). Administration of IL-21 before induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) enhances encephalitogenic T cell and NK function in the periphery and increases disease severity supporting IL-21 as a factor promoting pathology (Vollmer et al., 2005). By contrast, severe neurological impairment during EAE in the absence of IL-21 signaling, associated with a defect in peripheral CD4 T regulatory cells, implicates a protective role for IL-21 (Liu et al., 2008, Piao et al., 2008). More recently, IL-21 was shown to be essential for maintenance of local T cell responses in the central nervous system (CNS) during chronic parasitic infection with Toxoplasma gondii (Stumhofer et al., 2013). However, the influence of IL-21 on CNS immunity during viral encephalitis has not been studied.",

            "text": "Infection with the sub-lethal glia-tropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) induces an acute encephalomyelitis that resolves into a persistent infection restricted primarily to oligodendroglia (Parra et al., 1999, Bergmann et al., 2006). CD8 T cells are the primary effectors reducing virus replication using both perforin and gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3)-mediated mechanisms (Lin et al., 1997, Bergmann et al., 2004, Gonzalez et al., 2006). CD4 T cells play a vital supportive role by enhancing peripheral CD8 T cell priming/expansion and promoting local effector function within the CNS (Phares et al., 2012b). By contrast, humoral immunity is essential to control the persistent phase of infection (Lin et al., 1999, Tschen et al., 2002, Ramakrishna et al., 2003, Tschen et al., 2006). As CD4 T cells express IL-21 within the CNS during JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2011), we explored a potential role of IL-21 as a prominent factor providing local help for CD8 T cells as well as B cells. Infection of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed that expansion and activity of antiviral CD8 T cells in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) as well as their accumulation within the CNS was independent of IL-21 signaling. However granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3 and most prominently IL-10 expression were diminished in CNS-derived IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 expression was also reduced in CNS-derived IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells. The absence of IL-21R further delayed peripheral B cell activation and significantly impaired CNS humoral responses. While altered T cell activity in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice did not impede early viral control, infectious virus persisted prior to and subsequent to emergence of CNS humoral responses. Nevertheless, clinical scores and the extent of myelin loss were comparable throughout the early persisting phase. Overall, these data support IL-21 as a cytokine optimizing both CNS T cell antiviral activity and humoral responses, thus lowering the set point of viral persistence and ultimately preventing mortality.",

T cell accumulation in the CNS peaks between days 7 and 10 post-infection (p.i.), however, effector function as monitored by IFN-\u03b3 secretion is maximal at day 7 p.i. and declines thereafter, coincident with a prominent decline in viral replication (Bergmann et al., 2006, Savarin et al., 2010, Phares et al., 2012b). This potent antiviral activity elicited by antigen re-encounter within the CNS is enhanced by CD4 T cells (Phares et al., 2012b). Similar to increased IL-21 in CLN, IL-21 expression is sustained throughout T cell-mediated clearance in the CNS (Phares et al., 2011). To assess whether IL-21R is upregulated upon prolonged antigen exposure in the CNS, we monitored the kinetics of IL-21R expression in activated WT CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CLN and CNS following JHMV infection. For this purpose, IL-21R transcripts were assessed in FACS purified populations of CLN-derived na\u00efve CD44loCD62Lhi and activated CD44hiCD62Llo T cells, as well as CNS-derived T cells, which have an activated CD44hiCD62Llo phenotype (Bergmann et al., 1999). IL-21R mRNA levels were higher in CLN-derived na\u00efve relative to activated T cells at both day 5 and 7 p.i., with no differences comparing the respective CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets or time points (Fig. 1A). In the CNS, IL-21R mRNA levels in CD4 T cells were similarly low to activated counterparts in CLN at day 7 p.i., but increased ~ 2.5 fold by day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B). Transcript levels in CNS-derived CD8 T cells also increased ~ 3-fold between days 7 and 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B). Comparison between CNS-derived T cell subsets revealed that IL-21R mRNA levels were ~ 30 and ~ 50% higher in CD8 relative to CD4 T cells at 7 and 10 days p.i., respectively (Fig. 1B). The overall ~ 3-4 fold increase in IL-21R transcripts in both T cell subsets from day 7 to 10 p.i. suggested an increased IL-21 signaling capacity in the CNS, possibly to sustain T cell effector function.",

We therefore monitored a potential influence of IL-21 on peripheral virus-specific CD8 T cell activation in the CLN prior to analysis of CNS T cells by comparing responses in infected WT and IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice. Total numbers of T and B lymphocytes were similar in CLN by flow cytometric analysis in both groups (data not shown). There were also no differences in the expression of the activation markers CD69 or CD44 (data not shown), or numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells by tetramer analysis (Fig. 2A) or IFN-\u03b3 secretion (Fig. 2B) in the CLN of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice at days 7 and 10 p.i. The apparent IL-21R independent T cell activation in CLN was verified by analysis of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-10 mRNA, produced by both CD4 and CD8 T cells, and IL-21 mRNA, expressed mainly by CD4 T cells, during JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2011, Puntambekar et al., 2011, Phares et al., 2012a). Transcript levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-21 were all comparable or slightly increased in total CLN mRNA of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice (Fig. 2C \u2013 F). Consistent with enhanced IL-21 mRNA at day 10 p.i., TFH cells, identified as PD-1hiCXCR5+ CD4 T cells, were also elevated in the absence of IL-21R (Fig. 2G). The absence of IL-21 signaling thus did not impair T cell activation at the priming site following CNS infection.",

IFN-\u03b3 protein levels were significantly reduced in the CNS of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 7 p.i., and dropped to the same low levels as in WT mice by day 10 and 14 p.i. (Fig. 4B). To assess whether decreased IFN-\u03b3 in the CNS of infected IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice was attributed to diminished IFN-\u03b3 production by CD4 or CD8 T cells, T cell subsets were purified from the infected CNS at 7 and 10 days p.i. to directly assess transcriptional T cell activity in vivo. IFN-\u03b3 transcripts were reduced by ~ 35% in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells compared to WT counterparts at day 7 and 10 days p.i., (Fig. 4C). IFN-\u03b3 transcripts were also ~ 30% lower in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells relative to WT CD4 T cells at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 4B), suggesting IL-21 acts on both CD8 as well as CD4 T cells to promote IFN-\u03b3 production. The overall greater IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in CD4 relative to CD8 T cells (Fig. 4C), yet higher numbers of CD8 T cells in the CNS at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 3), argue the reduction in total CNS IFN-\u03b3 protein was attributed to both T cell populations. To determine whether other T cell effector molecules were also diminished in absence of IL-21 signaling, expression of IL-2, IL-10, IL-21 and CCL5 transcripts was assessed. IL-17 analysis was excluded, as there is no evidence for involvement of this cytokine during JHMV infection (Kapil et al., 2009). Recent findings demonstrated that highly lytic CNS-derived CD8 T cells during JHMV infection are marked by IL-10 expression (Trandem et al., 2011). Surprisingly, IL-10 transcripts were decreased by > 50% in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i., and ~ 65% by day 10 p.i. (Fig. 5A) further suggesting impaired cytolytic capacity by IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells. IL-10 mRNA was also lower in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT CD4 T cells, however the decline was less severe (Fig. 5B). In EAE, IL-21 deficiency impaired the generation of CD25+CD4 T regulatory cells (Liu et al., 2008, Piao et al., 2008), a prominent source of IL-10 in the CNS of JHMV-infected mice (Puntambekar et al., 2011). However, frequencies of CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells within total CD4 T cells were similar in the CNS of JHMV infected IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice (Day 7: WT 22 \u00b1 2% vs IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 26 \u00b1 2%; Day 10: WT 19 \u00b1 1% vs IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 16 \u00b1 1%). IL-21 independent CNS accumulation of CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells, yet reduced IL-10 mRNA in CNS-derived IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells supports diminished IL-10 production on a cellular basis. In contrast to lower IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 mRNA levels in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells at day 7 p.i., IL-21 mRNA was only diminished at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 5B). Importantly, no reductions in IL-2 or CCL5 transcripts in either CD8 or CD4 T cells demonstrated that IL-21 signaling selectively affects distinct T cell responses (Fig. 5A and B).",

There were also no detectable differences at day 10 p.i. in the frequencies of Annexin-V+ CNS-derived CD8 T cells (WT 8.3 \u00b1 1.1%; IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 7.2 \u00b1 1.5%) or CD4 T cells (WT 23.0 \u00b1 3.3%; IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 22.5 \u00b1 3.0%) analyzed directly ex vivo without peptide stimulation. Similar T cell recruitment (Fig. 3) and apoptosis thus supported IL-21 independent T cell survival within the CNS. Nevertheless, both transcriptional and flow cytometric analyses demonstrate a role for IL-21 in selectively optimizing both CD4 and CD8 T cell functions at the effector site.",

Notably, viral antigen and RNA persists in spinal cords of WT mice despite absence of infectious virus (Gonzalez et al., 2006).

Moreover, although JHMV infection is controlled by T cells through day 14 p.i., independent of humoral responses, Ab-secreting cells (ASC) prevent reemergence of persisting virus (Lin et al., 1999, Tschen et al., 2002, Ramakrishna et al., 2003, Tschen et al., 2006). Humoral responses were therefore analyzed in the periphery and CNS to monitor whether impaired Ab production contributes to sustained virus replication in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice. Serum neutralizing Ab were both delayed and reduced in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice, but nevertheless increased by 10-fold between days 14 and 21 p.i. in both groups (Fig. 7A). Decreased circulating Ab correlated with lower frequencies of CD138+ ASC in the CLN of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice at days 7 and 10 p.i. (Fig. 7B). These data support that IL-21R deficiency diminished, but did not abrogate peripheral ASC activation following JHMV infection, similar to peripheral infections (Elsaesser et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009, Rasheed et al., 2013). To assess whether Ab production in the CNS was also altered, IgG and \u03ba-light chain transcripts were measured as a reliable readout for ASC (Marques et al., 2011). IgG and \u03ba-light chain mRNA levels were barely detectable in the CNS at day 7 p.i. and increased progressively throughout day 21 p.i. in both groups (Fig. 7C and D). However, the relative increase was very modest in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice, only reaching 10% of WT values by day 21 p.i. Taken together the results indicate that impaired local Ab production contributes to the inability to clear infectious virus in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice subsequent to day 14 p.i.",

Both infection of oligodendrocytes and T cell effector activity contributes to the severity of demyelination, which is evident by day 10 p.i. and peaks between days 14 and 21 p.i., consistent with paralytic clinical disease. We therefore assessed whether increased viral load at day 14 p.i. in IL-21 R\u2212/\u2212 mice correlated with enhanced demyelination. Surprisingly histological analysis indicated that demyelination was similar in both WT and IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, overall onset and progression of clinical symptoms were comparable in WT and IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 8B) out to 21 days p.i. despite higher CNS viral loads in the IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice after day 10 p.i. (Fig. 6). However, morbidity increased thereafter with mortality beginning 4\u20135 weeks p.i. and the majority of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice ultimately succumbing to infection (Fig. 8C). The inability to clear infectious virus was thus not associated with an immediate increase in demyelination or clinical disease.",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which IL-21 regulates CNS inflammation have only been explored in a limited number of experimental models including EAE and parasite infection (Vollmer et al., 2005, Nurieva et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2008, Piao et al., 2008, Stumhofer et al., 2013). IL-21 signaling appears protective in EAE by promoting peripheral CD4 T regulatory cell function, thus limiting expansion of auto reactive T cells (Liu et al., 2008, Piao et al., 2008). However, impaired TH17 differentiation and protection against EAE in IL-21\u2212/\u2212 mice suggest a detrimental role (Nurieva et al., 2007). Following T. gondii infection, IL-21 acts to promote both peripheral humoral immunity and T cell responses in the CNS, thus controlling persisting CNS infection and preventing mortality (Stumhofer et al., 2013). Following sub-lethal JHMV induced encephalomyelitis CD4 T cells are the predominant cell type expressing IL-21 (Phares et al., 2012a), and unlike EAE, there is no evidence for a contribution of IL-17 to pathogenesis (Kapil et al., 2009). As CD4 T cells are vital in promoting antiviral CD8 T cell function within the CNS (Phares et al., 2012b), and IL-2 is dispensable for antiviral CD8 T cell function during JHMV infection (Zhou et al., 2005), IL-21 was tested as the likely candidate providing T cell help. While the present study supports a role for IL-21 signaling in enhancing IFN-\u03b3 and cytolytic effector molecules by CD8 T cells within the CNS, a more prominent effect was observed in aiding IL-10 transcript expression by both CNS-derived CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets; moreover, the major effect of IL-21R deficiency was significantly impaired humoral responses. These combined deficiencies resulted in loss of initial viral control, albeit without a concomitant increase in demyelination and clinical disease. Mortality was gradually observed after 3 weeks p.i., similar to B cell deficient mice (Ramakrishna et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Overall, the effects of IL-21R deficiency on CD8 T cells during JHMV infection were modest compared to CD4 T cell ablation, which impairs both peripheral CD8 T cell activation and function within the CNS (Phares et al., 2012b). IL-21 can directly regulate T cells at numerous levels (Zeng et al., 2005, Casey and Mescher, 2007, Ostiguy et al., 2007, Elsaesser et al., 2009, Frohlich et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009, Barker et al., 2010, Novy et al., 2011), but can also modulate DC function and antigen presentation to T cells (Brandt et al., 2003a, Brandt et al., 2003b, Strengell et al., 2006). No differences in JHMV-specific CD8 T cell expansion and expression of T cell-derived cytokines in the CLN of IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice suggest IL-21 independent DC licensing and initial T cell activation, consistent with results in LCMV infected IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice (Elsaesser et al., 2009, Frohlich et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009). However, IL-21R independent CNS chemokine expression and mobilization of activated T cells to the CNS contrasted the reduced chemokine production and T cell recruitment into the lung of pneumovirus infected IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice (Spolski et al., 2012). The modest effect of IL-21 on T cell effector molecules specifically in the CNS was indicated by decreased granzyme B, as well as perforin and IFN-\u03b3 transcript expression in purified CNS-derived IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells analyzed directly ex vivo. The more severely diminished IL-10 transcripts further supported fewer highly cytotoxic IL-10+ CD8 T cells within the CNS (Trandem et al., 2011). However, this is difficult to confirm in ex vivo T cell assays, as the infected target cells in vivo express distinct levels of inhibitory molecules (Phares et al., 2009, Phares et al., 2012a). Notably, the decreases in granzyme B and IL-10 transcripts were similar in magnitude to CNS-derived CD8 T cells from CD4 T cell depleted versus WT JHMV-infected mice (Phares et al., 2012b). Whether IL-21 directly promotes granzyme B and IL-10 production by T cells, or indirectly via effects on local antigen presenting cells, remains unclear. Nevertheless, transcript levels of IL-2, CCL5 and tumor necrosis factor (data not shown) were similar in CNS-derived CD8 T cells from WT and IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting IL-21 selective enhances specific functions. In this context it is of interest to note that IL-21 can support CD8 T cell activity via the transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) (Sutherland et al., 2013), which binds to the promoters of IFN-\u03b3, granzyme B, and perforin (Szabo et al., 2002, Pearce et al., 2003, Sullivan et al., 2003). However, we found no differences in T-bet mRNA levels in purified CNS-derived WT and IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells (data not shown), suggesting IL-21 mediated effects on CD8 T cells are not associated with altered T-bet activity. Similar to JHMV infection, no differences in peripheral CD8 T cell expansion or expression of T cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 were detected between T. gondii infected IL-21\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice; however, during chronic infection loss of IL-21 reduced CNS-derived T cell-mediated IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 production (Stumhofer et al., 2013) arguing IL-21 to be essential for maintenance of local T cell responses in the CNS. Lastly, although Annexin-V+ CD8 T cells increased ~ 2.5 fold in the CNS of JHMV-infected WT mice following CD4 T cell depletion (Phares et al., 2012b) and IL-21 is known to promote CD8 T cell survival (Novy et al., 2011), IL-21R deficiency did not alter frequencies of CNS-derived Annexin-V+ CD8 T cells. These results indicated CD4 T cell-mediated survival of CNS-derived CD8 T cells during JHMV infection is IL-21 independent contrasting chronic T. gondii infection (Stumhofer et al., 2013).",

During JHMV infection higher expression of IL-21R transcripts in CNS-derived CD8 relative to CD4 T cells with time suggested that CD8 T cells may be more dependent on IL-21 signaling at the effector site. This is supported by greater reductions of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 transcripts in CNS-derived IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD8 than CD4 T cells relative to their respective WT counterparts. By contrast, during peripheral LCMV infection IL-21R deficiency increases the numbers of IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-2+ CD4 T cells (Elsaesser et al., 2009), suggesting that IL-21 suppresses distinct facets of CD4 T cell function. During EAE IL-21R deficiency is associated with a defect in CD25+CD4 T regulatory cell generation resulting in severe neurological impairment (Liu et al., 2008, Piao et al., 2008). CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T regulatory cells are a prominent source of IL-10 in the CNS of JHMV infected mice (Puntambekar et al., 2011). However, distinct from EAE (Liu et al., 2008, Piao et al., 2008), IL-21R deficiency did not alter frequencies of CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells compared to WT mice. Similar accumulation of CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells, yet reduced IL-10 mRNA in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells, thus supports diminished IL-10 production on a cellular basis, similar to CD8 T cells. While diminished IL-10 is associated with enhanced CNS viral clearance and tissue damage (Trandem et al., 2011), reduced IL-10 in JHMV infected IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice coincided with impaired control of infectious virus without affecting demyelination or clinical disease over the first 3 weeks of infection. These data support additional functions of IL-21 on CNS resident cells as suggested by detection of IL-21R on some neurons (Tzartos et al., 2011).",

Similar to impaired serum Ab responses following LCMV infection (Elsaesser et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009, Rasheed et al., 2013), IL-21R deficiency diminished peripheral ASC activation and antiviral serum Ab following JHMV infection. However, this was not associated with impaired generation of TFH cells, which corroborates similar results during LCMV (Rasheed et al., 2013), T. gondii (Stumhofer et al., 2013) and Heligmosomoides polygyrus (King et al., 2010) infection as well as following live recombinant rabies-based vaccination (Dorfmeier et al., 2013). The significant increases in TFH cells compared to WT mice were also noted during H. polygyrus infection and live recombinant rabies-based vaccination in IL-21R\u2212/\u2212 mice (King et al., 2010, Dorfmeier et al., 2013), suggesting that IL-21 signaling may play an inhibitory role in TFH cell development. Whether the severely impaired Ab production in the CNS is a direct consequence of suboptimal peripheral humoral responses or whether IL-21 further acts directly on B cells within the CNS warrants further investigation. Similarly, the characteristics of the IL-21 producing CD4 T cells in the CNS remain to be identified, as preliminary analysis shows no evidence for TFH cell phenotype.",
