            "text": "The dialogue between the immune system and brain tumors has been strongly influenced by two key hypotheses, immune privilege and cancer immunosurveillance, both of which originated more than 50 ago. In the 1940s, Medawar reported that allografts in the CNS survived longer than those in other tissues (Medewar, 1948), which led Barker and Billingham to coin the term immune privilege to describe such sites (Barker and Billingham, 1977). The concept of limited immune responsiveness in the brain was interpreted as being consistent with the overriding need to control inflammatory reactions and their potentially damaging consequences to neuronal networks with low regenerative capacity. The absence of a lymphatic system within the CNS and the presence of a specialized blood-brain barrier (BBB) in most CNS compartments suggested immune isolation achieved by restricting entry of blood-born molecules such as immunoglobulins, as well as leukocytes, albeit by mechanisms that are under constant revision (Bechmann et al., 2007). With several decades of more detailed observations of immune responses in the CNS, it is now clear that both protective (e.g., antiviral) and pathogenic (e.g., autoimmune) immune responses can and do occur in the CNS, but these may be quantitatively and qualitatively different to those occurring in other sites. In a reappraisal of CNS immune privilege (Bechmann et al., 2007), many compelling arguments were made for a redefinition of privilege, underlining that it is a relative state, and only applicable to the parenchyma of the intact, noninflamed brain.",

            "text": "Moreover, perhaps in view of the longstanding, oversimplistic interpretations of immune privilege, one of the cornerstones of modern tumor immunology, the cancer immunosurveillance\nhypothesis of Burnet and Thomas (Burnet, 1970) was not immediately seen to directly concern brain tumors. The theory proposes that the immune system continually surveys the organism and recognizes and destroys abnormal cells. Recognition of cancer certainly occurs, but it is now clear that the outcome of such detection is not always protective immunosurveillance. This led to a refined theory of immunoediting (Dunn et al., 2006) in which different outcomes are described following cancer and immune system interaction: namely, elimination, equilibrium, and tumor escape. Analysis of mouse models with clearly defined immunodeficiencies shows that both innate and adaptive immune responses influence tumor outgrowth: mice lacking T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and those with deficiencies in Type 1 or Type 2 interferons (IFNs) have higher tumor incidence. Moreover, analyses of large cohorts of immunosuppressed patients show that incidence of not only virally associated cancers but also cancers with no known association with infection is increased. However, to date, brain tumors have not been among the tumors noted to occur more frequently. This is likely due to the lower expected frequency of these malignancies, but it may also be because brain tumors are rarely eliminated spontaneously, and more likely persist in equilibrium with the host. Or else they rapidly escape immune control, as would appear to be the case once malignant gliomas are detected. In this case, the notion of immunoediting predicts that outgrowing tumors will have been sculpted by interaction with the immune system, for example, by selection of tumors able to neutralize immune effector mechanisms, as will be discussed (see below).",

            "text": "The first step in tumor immunity is alerting the immune system to the presence of tumor; this is achieved by innate immunity. The innate immune system comprises soluble factors such as components of the complement system, but more important for tumor immunity are the cells, such as the macrophages/microglia, granulocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). These cells efficiently detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns by means of germline-encoded pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) that include the toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, their role is now understood to be wider than merely detecting infection by a pathogen; they can also detect perturbations to the organism that can be considered \u201cdangerous\u201d (Matzinger, 1994), and PRR can also be viewed as \u201cpattern\u201d recognition receptors able to deliver danger signals. For example, endogenous ligands have been identified for all human TLRs except for TLRs 5 and 10. These include the heat shock proteins (HSPs) upregulated by stressed cells (binding to TLRs 2 and 4) and nucleic acids released by dying tumor cells (binding to TLRs 3, 7, and 9) (Barrat and Coffman, 2008; Barton and Medzhitov, 2002; Pulendran, 2005).",

            "text": "Detection of cancer will be initially mediated by tissue-resident sentinel cells of the innate immune system, which for most tissues are the DCs and the macrophages. But for the brain, DCs are not resident in the parenchyma (although they may appear at later stages of a response), and the most important endogenous sentinels are the microglial cells (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007). These specialized brain macrophages are widely distributed throughout the brain parenchyma and may actually be recruited to the site of glioma occurrence, where they can represent up to a third of the cells composing the tumor (Graeber et al., 2002). Microglia express several TLRs, including TLR 4 that is proposed to bind several factors produced by dying cells in the glioma microenvironment (Hussain et al., 2006). If TLR ligation leads to full activation of the microglial cell, subsequent functions potentially include phagocytosis, chemokine and cytokine release, antigen presentation, and even tumor cell killing. However, other less useful outcomes have been suggested, including neurotoxicity and enhancement of tumor invasiveness through the upregulation of metalloproteinases. These contrasting functions may be attributed to the extreme plasticity of microglia in response to their local milieu. Indeed, the brain microenvironment in which they must function is also comprised of astroglial cells which exhibit characteristics of innate immune function, including PRR expression, activation to a reactive state, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines (Farina et al., 2007). Furthermore, in the case of malignancy, microglial function will also be subject to modulation by the local tumor microenvironment (Hussain et al., 2006; Markovic et al., 2005).",

            "text": "In a protective antitumor immune response, once the endogenous sentinels of innate immunity are alerted, there are two subsequent events: to limit (or eliminate) the source of danger by innate effector functions of resident cells and to recruit further resources (particularly T cells, as discussed in the next section). For glioma, there is little in vivo evidence to suggest that tumoricidal microglia spontaneously restrain brain tumor growth (Graeber et al., 2002). The other innate effector cell that has the potential to recognize and kill tumor cells is the NK cell, which has been the subject of intensive investigations to characterize the receptors that regulate its function. In order to mediate cytolysis, NK cells must receive a signal through one of their activating receptors such as NKG2D, but to result in activation, there must be an absence of signaling through inhibitory receptors (e.g., members of the CD158 family of receptors) (Lanier, 2008). Expression of ligands for NKG2D is low on normal cells, but upregulated on cells subjected to genotoxic stress, as occurs in neoplastic transformation. Indeed, certain human glioma fulfill the requirements for NK cell recognition and activation, with expression of the NKG2D ligands MICA/B (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-chain-related molecules A and B) and UL16-binding proteins (ULBP) 1\u20133 (Eisele et al., 2006), and a downregulation of some HLA molecules which are ligands for the CD158 inhibitory receptors (Facoetti et al., 2005). NK cells are not only cytotoxic but also an early source of IFN-\u03b3, which can be angiostatic and can amplify T-cell mediated tumor immunity. However, little is known about the NK cells or their potential impact at the tumor site in human glioma; although in a murine intracranial tumor model (B16 melanoma), interactions between DCs, NK cells, and T cells facilitated protective tumor immunity (Prins et al., 2006c).",

Full activation of na\u00efve T cells to become effector cells requires a second signal, which is usually delivered by costimulatory molecules such as members of the B7 family (particularly CD80 and CD86) expressed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the innate immune system, the most efficient of which are the DCs (Fig. 48.2). Activation of na\u00efve T cells (priming) by APCs within the secondary lymphoid tissue triggers clonal expansion of T cells and a differentiation program that will influence the magnitude and quality of the antitumor immune response, i.e., T-cell effector functions (cytotoxicity, cytokine release, suppression), tissue tropism, and persistence as T effector or T memory cells. Although this is occurring in the LN, these factors are principally predetermined by the innate immune reaction, upstream at the tumor site (or at a vaccination site). The resulting clonally expanded T cells (now highly enriched for tumor antigen specificity) can then exit the LN via the efferent lymph, enter the bloodstream, and traffic more or less efficiently to the tumor site, depending upon the pattern of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors (their \u201choming phenotype\u201d) with which they have been programed to express by the DC.\n\n",

For brain tumors, this scenario is complicated by the particularities of CNS cellular composition and anatomy: there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain, and there are no resident DCs in the healthy brain parenchyma.

More recently, particulate material was also shown to reach cervical and submandibular LN after intracerebral injection (Walter and Albert, 2007). These studies confirm functional drainage in the absence of lymphatics, but they do not adequately explain the initiation of adaptive immunity. For this to occur without induction of immune tolerance, there must be not only antigen presented to T cells in the cervical LN but also a second signal indicating danger or infection. The best understood source of such a second signal is an APC that has sensed danger at its source, i.e., at the tumor site in the brain.",

The microglia are the most abundant phagocytes in the brain, and they can be induced to express costimulatory molecules, and they can present antigens to MHC class II restricted CD4 T cells in vitro (Aloisi et al., 2000). The more demanding function of cross-presentation, i.e., uptake of exogenous antigens and presentation of processed peptides derived therefrom on MHC class I molecules, has only been reported in one in vitro study using ovalbumin as antigen (Beauvillain et al., 2008). Whether these in vitro results apply to microglia in vivo is debatable, partly because of the criteria used to define microglia, such as morphology, anatomic location, and level of expression of macrophage associated markers, and even function (Davoust et al., 2008). Indeed, efficient antigen presentation in vitro requires a phenotype and function of a reactive, or activated microglial cell, which is virtually indistinguishable from any activated macrophage. The final function necessary for in vivo initiation of T-cell immunity is migration to the LN. Expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 is associated with migration to LN and has been reported for murine microglia (Dijkstra et al., 2006), but functional LN homing experiments were not performed.",

However, phenotypic studies do not always allow extrapolation to function, and in different mouse models, CNS DC interactions with T cells have been defined as either stimulatory (Fischer and Reichmann, 2001; Ling et al., 2008) or inhibitory (Suter et al., 2003). Overall, these studies confirm that the plasticity of microglial cells may give rise to cells that resemble macrophages or DCs, but they do not give definitive answers for the origins and identity of the cell that is ultimately able to form the link between innate immune detection of malignancy in the brain and the induction of adaptive immunity in the LN.

However, it is currently unclear whether endothelial cells would be as efficient in phagocytosing and cross-presenting tumor-derived antigens as they are in presenting soluble peptide, and so it remains to be determined whether such a mechanism will have relevance for tumor immunity. Generally, there are considered to be more opportunities for T cells to interact with their specific antigen once they traverse the endothelium barrier, as demonstrated by the preferential retention in the brain of autoreactive and virus-specific CD4 T cells (Hickey, 1999) and of tumor specific CD8 T cells (Calzascia et al., 2003).",

This facilitates contact between chemokine receptors on the T cell (such as CCR5) and corresponding immobilized chemokines on the luminal face of the endothelial cell (such as CCL5). Chemokine receptor signaling leads to conformational changes in T-cell-expressed integrins, allowing firm adhesion to the cell adhesion molecules on the endothelium, arrest, and diapedesis (Butcher et al., 1999).

            "text": "The adhesion molecule that is consistently implicated in T-cell entry to the CNS in most species and models tested is \u03b14 integrin (CD49d). Integrins are expressed as heterodimers and \u03b14 partners with either \u03b21 (CD29) or \u03b27 integrin chains. For the CNS, the \u03b14\u03b21 integrin (also called VLA-4) and its interaction with VCAM-1 on endothelial cells are central. In EAE, \u03b14\u03b21 may facilitate both lower affinity rolling interactions and higher affinity arrest, according to the particular CNS microvasculature involved (Engelhardt, 2006). In mouse brain tumor models, \u03b14\u03b21 integrin was also shown to be a key molecule for T-cell entry to the tumor site. We found that high levels of \u03b14\u03b21 integrin are induced on tumor-specific CD4 T cells (PRW and PYD unpublished data) and CD8 T cells (Calzascia et al., 2005), when they are primed by endogenous APC in the cervical LN of brain tumor-bearing mice. This was functionally relevant since \u03b14-specific blocking antibody significantly reduced brain entry of these T cells. Further exploration of the role of integrins in brain tropism has been performed on CD8 T cells polarized toward different cytokine-secreting profiles. Mouse CD8 T cells with a type 1 profile (IFN-\u03b3-secreting) expressed higher levels of \u03b14\u03b21 integrin and trafficked to the brain more efficiently than type 2, interleukin (IL)-4 secreting CD8 T cells (Sasaki et al., 2007). This finding is particularly relevant for brain tumor immunotherapy, since T cells receiving the same in vitro or in vivo stimuli can manifest two key characteristics for efficacious antitumor function: appropriate tissue tropism and cytokine expression. The same key \u03b14\u03b21 integrin is also implicated in CNS entry of T cells in humans. Patients with MS receiving a novel treatment in which \u03b14 integrins were targeted using the humanized antibody natalizumab had reduced levels of inflammatory leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, and generally showed some clinical improvement (Stuve et al., 2006). Taken together, the results from these different studies unequivocally establish an important role for \u03b14\u03b21 integrin in T-cell homing to the CNS. However, this should not be interpreted to mean that \u03b14\u03b21 specifically targets T cells to the brain, since most of the studies have analyzed a single tissue, the brain. Rather, it is likely that if \u03b14\u03b21 integrin is abundantly expressed by a T cell; this molecule can facilitate entry to the CNS. Nevertheless, since the inhibition or blocking of \u03b14\u03b21 does not totally abrogate T cell entry to the CNS, other molecules are probably also involved and may either substitute for or synergize with \u03b14\u03b21.",

Nearly all of this data derives from studies on EAE and MS, with findings that are often specific for particular CNS regions and specific stages of the disease. Roles in T-cell extravasation to brain tumors, either in spontaneous immunity or in immunotherapy applications, cannot be excluded. An induction of E- and P-selectin ligands on tumor-specific CD8 T cells dividing in the cervical LN was observed in mice harboring intracranial tumors, but the functional significance of this observation was not analyzed (Calzascia et al., 2005). P-selectin (and to a lesser extent, E-selectin) and their ligands were found to contribute to T-cell rolling on certain inflamed CNS microvessels using intravital microscopy and in vitro studies. This study concluded that CD8 T cells from MS patients preferentially rolled via P-selectin, whereas CD4 T cells rolled via \u03b14 integrin (Battistini et al., 2003). However, others have found that CNS inflammation was not altered following genetic ablation or overexpression of E- and P-selectins or their ligands, or after antibody blocking (Engelhardt, 2006). Therefore, the real in vivo significance of the selectins, at least in EAE, has been difficult to establish.",

In vitro studies in EAE suggested potential roles for LFA-1 particularly during the transendothelial migration of T cells.

Antibody blockade experiments showed that CD4 T cell and monocyte transmigration across brain endothelial cells was partially ALCAM dependent, and ALCAM neutralization in vivo reduced EAE severity. It was noteworthy that among the T cells, only the CD4 T-cell subset appears to use ALCAM during transmigration, since CD8 T cells were totally unaffected, even though they express similar levels of the CD6 ALCAM receptor. These findings, if confirmed in the context of brain tumor immunity, may open up future possibilities to modulate T-cell subset brain infiltration in future immunotherapies.",

Unraveling the roles of individual chemokines (\u02dc50) and their receptors (\u02dc20) is complex because chemokines can bind multiple receptors, and receptors can bind multiple chemokines. Furthermore, in the context of brain tumors, the tumor itself is a source of chemokines which may influence the quantity and quality of the resulting immune infiltrate (van Meir, 1999, Dey et al., 2006, Brown et al., 2007; Jordan et al., 2008). Chemokines are proposed to influence multiple steps of CNS infiltration, from the blood to migration within the brain parenchyma, although not all steps have been validated in vivo in the CNS (Rebenko-Moll et al., 2006). In the lumen of CNS microvessels, chemokines immobilized on endothelial cells can trigger integrin activation of tethered leukocytes (particularly \u03b14\u03b21 in the context of brain tropic T cells) and facilitate high-affinity interactions and arrest. Diapedesis can then be promoted by chemokines mediating locomotion to interendothelial junctions. T cells may then sample abluminal chemokines by extending processes through intercellular junctions. And finally, chemokine gradients exist within the brain parenchyma to attract T cells to the tumor site.",

The proportion of T cells expressing CXCR3 is enhanced among T cells present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS and in EAE, and the levels of two of its ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, are elevated in the CSF during acute phase of MS. However, in vivo experiments with blocking antibodies and CXCR3 deficient mice have yielded conflicting results, probably because CXCR3 influences EAE at multiple levels (e.g., IFN-\u03b3 production) and not just at the level of trafficking. Similar considerations exist for CCR5 and its ligand CCL5, which are suggested to have roles in CNS viral infection (including West Nile virus, HIV, and coronavirus) but probably relate to T-cell function rather than trafficking. Another chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, CCR7, and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 may have multiple roles in CNS pathologies. The cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS and brain lesions of mice with progressive EAE accumulate CCR7-expressing T cells. Moreover, in addition, two ligands of CCR7, CCL19 and CCL21, are expressed at the BBB in brain of mice with EAE and at least in vitro, can mediate adhesion of CCR7+ T cells. However, studying the in vivo functional significance of this is difficult when using blocking antibodies or gene deficient mice, since na\u00efve T cells, a subset of memory T cells (Tcm), as well as some DCs, all express CCR7.",

Nevertheless, the level of infiltration of tumor-specific T cells will be a factor that will limit the efficacy of immunotherapies. Many current tumor T-cell immunotherapy protocols are adapted directly from therapies being tested for tumors in other sites, and yet the tumor pathology is fundamentally different. The lethality of most extracranial tumors is due to metastases, and the goal of T-cell immunotherapy will be that therapeutic T cells can reach the many sites of tumor dissemination. For primary CNS malignancies such as malignant glioma, the situation is different; these tumors are unique in oncology because they very rarely metastasize from their tissue of origin. The immunological problem for such tumors is thus strictly one of regional immunity. Thus, promoting efficient brain tropism of protective immune cells will undoubtedly benefit future glioma immunotherapies. For this it will be necessary to not only understand and induce the key molecules for T cell-entry to the CNS but also avoid induction of a homing phenotype that may lead to their entrapment elsewhere (for example, the mucosal surfaces if there is high \u03b14\u03b27 and CCR9 expression). In this regard, preclinical models in which multiple sites are studied will be helpful (Calzascia et al., 2005), for which the emerging technology of whole body imaging will be particularly appropriate (Prins et al., 2008b). A further refinement would be to ensure infiltration of only protective T cells, since a gross augmentation of any inflammatory infiltrate will be inappropriate and dangerous for the brain. An understanding of how subset-specific trafficking can be achieved would be a useful objective in the optimization of therapies.",

If the CD8 T cell has been fully activated in the periphery, the tumor cell needs only to express MHC class I/peptide (costimulatory molecules are not essential at the effector stage) for it to become a CTL target. Cytotoxicity occurs by the polarized exocytosis of the contents of cytotoxic granules into the immunological synapse formed between the CTL and the tumor target, and it is exquisitely specific, with no bystander killing. The granule contents include perforin and granulysin that perturb the tumor cell membrane and serine proteases known as granzymes that induce tumor cell death mainly through caspase-dependent pathways.

Cross-presenting DCs in the brain have not yet been reported, to our knowledge, for human malignant glioma. One consequence of cross-presentation of antigen is that antigen-specific T cells will be retained at the site of this cellular interaction. Indeed, we observed retention of tumor-specific CD8 T cells in the brain in a mouse model designed to address the issue of cross-presentation (Calzascia et al., 2003). In this model, intracranially implanted MT539MG astrocytoma cells were unable to directly present a defined tumor antigen, and so the presentation of this tumor antigen to T cells in the brain was occurring solely through cross-presentation, although the identity of the APC in this study was not determined. In several other experimental situations, indirect stimulation of CD8 T cells at the tumor site has been achieved by intracranial injection of DCs (Ehtesham et al., 2003; Kikuchi et al., 2002; Masson et al., 2007; Nishimura et al., 2006; Pellegatta et al., 2006).

Interestingly, these characteristics are associated with higher grade astrocytomas (Facoetti et al., 2005; Mehling et al., 2007). Of importance for future immunotherapy strategies are the in vitro observations that MHC can be upregulated on glioblastoma cell lines by IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b1 (Yang et al., 2004). Tumor cells escaping T-cell mediated immunity by downregulating MHC expression may risk attack by NK cells, which are normally inactive if their inhibitory receptors are ligated by MHC. However, several adaptations of malignant glioma may guard against this. Expression of MICA and ULBP2, ligands for the NKGD activating receptors on NK cells, was low or absent for WHO grade III and IV astrocytomas (Eisele et al., 2006), whereas an array of ligands (HLA-E, HLA-G, lectin-like transcript-1) for inhibitory NK receptors was overexpressed (Roth et al., 2007; Wischhusen et al., 2007). A further major consideration that can be considered as a factor leading to immune escape is the presence of areas of hypoxia, well documented in human glioma (Louis, 2006). These areas of tumor will be a particularly hostile microenvironment for immune cells, and the function and survival of T cells may be particularly sensitive to low oxygen tension (Sitkovsky and Lukashev, 2005).",

In some cases, the same molecule may function in multiple ways, the most notorious example of which is TGF-\u03b2. This multifunctional cytokine not only directly suppresses NK and T-cell proliferation and antitumor functions (including granzyme, FasL and IFN-\u03b3 expression) but also promotes other suppressive cells (see below), angiogenesis, and tumor invasion (Wrzesinski et al., 2007). TGF-\u03b2 (and in particular the TGF-\u03b22 isoform) is produced by glioma cell lines and by glioblastoma in vivo (Bodmer et al., 1989; Liau et al., 2005). Moreover, in a phase I DC vaccination trial for glioblastoma, we noted increased intratumoral infiltration by CTLs in four of eight patients who underwent reoperation after vaccination, which was inversely correlated with TGF-\u03b22 expression within the tumor and positively correlated with clinical survival (P = 0.047) (Liau et al., 2005). Consequently, TGF-\u03b2 or its effects have become attractive targets, and novel therapeutic approaches with inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides are being actively explored. Other soluble factors of astrocytoma origin that may have immunosuppressive potential include prostaglandin E2, gangliosides, and IL-10 (Walker et al., 2003), but the real in vivo concentration and impact of these factors has yet to be firmly established.",

Gliomas express Fas ligand in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, Fas ligand expressing glioma cell lines can kill Fas (CD95) expressing CD4 and CD8 T cell lines from the autologous donor, but in vivo, the role of Fas ligand expressing tumor cells is controversial (Walker et al., 2003, 1997). Gliomas also express B7-H1 (also called PD-L1), a member of the B7 family that is able to interact with T-cell expressed programed death-1 (PD-1) receptor expressed by T cells (Wilmotte et al., 2005; Wintterle et al., 2003), an interaction which negatively regulates T-cell activation. Interestingly, the expression of B7-H1 has been associated with a genetic event in gliomas, the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which activates the PI3 kinase pathway (Parsa et al., 2007). The immunosuppressive potential of PD-1-B7-H1 interactions in vivo has yet to be explored in intracranial tumors. CD70 is another cell surface molecule proposed to facilitate glioma immune escape as it can engage the counterreceptor on immune cells and induce apoptosis. CD70 is expressed by glioma in vitro and can indeed trigger apoptosis of immune cells (reviewed by (Walker et al., 2003)). However, the first in vivo studies of gliomas transfected with CD70 indicated an immune stimulatory role, and the authors even suggested exploiting the CD70\u2013CD27 axis in immunotherapy (Aulwurm et al., 2006). The role of CD70 expressed by non-manipulated human glioma in vivo therefore awaits clarification.",

Cells of different origin (see below) can be involved in suppressing immune responses and have valuable roles in regulating autimmmunity and controlling inflammation. However, these functions may also blunt spontaneous or vaccine-induced tumor immunity. Furthermore, immunosuppressive cells can in some cases be recruited or induced by factors (e.g., cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2) produced by tumor cells. Mesenchymal stem cells have strong anti-inflammatory or antiproliferative effects on immune cells but may increase glioma cell proliferation. They are attracted by glioma culture supernatant and purified factors including IL-8, VEGF, and TGF-\u03b2 (Birnbaum et al., 2007), but in vivo immunosuppressive roles in glioma remain to be determined. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are another potentially immunosuppressive cell type receiving increasing attention in the context of cancer, and it is noteworthy that they are stimulated by prostaglandin E2, which can be secreted by glioma cells (Marx, 2008). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells have also been studied in the context of brain tumor models (Prins et al., 2002), although little is known about their presence at the brain tumor site in patients.",

Either Tregs are produced as a functionally mature T-cell subset in the thymus (natural Tregs) or other na\u00efve CD4 T cells can differentiate into induced Tregs under the influence of certain cytokines including TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2. The role of Tregs in immune homeostasis is now well defined. They maintain immunological tolerance to self-antigens, and mutations leading to their absence in animals (Scurfy mice) or patients (IPEX), or their inhibition or ablation, leads to autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Tregs function by an array of cell contact and cytokine-mediated mechanisms to suppress T cells, B cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs at both the induction and effector stages of immune responses. In the context of malignancy, Tregs accumulate in many tumors, including human glioma (El Andaloussi and Lesniak, 2007; Fecci et al., 2006a; Hussain et al., 2006), and Treg depletion or inhibition in murine brain tumor models can reveal spontaneous tumor immunity, or enhance induced immunity (Curtin et al., 2008; El Andaloussi et al., 2006; Fecci et al., 2006b; Grauer et al., 2007). While the importance of Treg in the antiglioma immune response is widely accepted, there are many challenges in identifying and modulating these cells. Foremost is the lack of a unique marker to identify Tregs. Most markers are shared with activated effector T cells (e.g., CD25), and the best specific Treg marker in mice (the transcription factor Foxp3) is intracellular (and so inaccessible to antibodies in vivo), and expression is not restricted to Treg in human T cells.",

            "text": "Significant progress in defining the nature of the antitumor response has been made by the discovery and characterization of TAAs, beginning with the report of the first melanoma antigen (MAGE) in 1991 (Van den Eynde et al., 1995; van der Bruggen et al., 1991). Intensive research is underway into the use of TAAs as potential targets of immune-based cancer treatments. The key TAAs under investigation are MAGE-3, MART-1, tyrosinase, TRP-2, and gp100 for melanoma (Panelli et al., 2000; Parkhurst et al., 1998, 1996; Ribas, 2006; Ribas et al., 2000); PSA and PAP for prostate cancer (Murphy et al., 1996\n1999); survivin for many solid tumors (Katoh et al., 2003); and HER-2/neu for breast and ovarian cancers (Disis et al., 2002, 2004; Knutson and Disis, 2001; Knutson et al., 2001). A prominent issue that distinguishes cerebral malignancies from other tumors, such as melanoma, is the paucity of well-defined tumor-specific antigens. Indeed, the difficulties of immune response monitoring are particularly acute in patients with malignant gliomas because, in contrast to patients with melanoma, there are few extensively characterized tumor antigens that can be recognized by T cells. Unless advances in this domain occur, rational advances in immune-based brain tumor therapy may be significantly hampered.",

            "text": "In recent years, genome-wide techniques have dramatically accelerated our ability to obtain molecular profiles of gene defects in gliomas, resulting in a more readily accessible source of information on the genes and gene products that produce antigens (TCGA, 2008). Advances in brain tumor \u201cimmunomics\u201d have led to the recent identification of several TAAs expressed by human gliomas. These include tumor-specific antigens unique to the oncogenic transformation process (EGFRvIII) or overexpressed following activation of oncogenic pathways (EphA2, IL-13R\u03b1) (Husain et al., 2001; Kuwashima et al., 2005; Okano et al., 2002; Saikali et al., 2007; Shimato et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2006) (see also Chapter 35), cancer-testes antigens normally expressed only during development (cancer-testes antigens; NY-ESO-1, MAGE, GAGE, SART, SSX) (Bodey et al., 2008; Chi et al., 1997; Sahin et al., 2000), neuroectodermal antigens involved in pigment synthesis (e.g., melanoma-associated antigens; gp100, tyrosinase, TRP-1, TRP-2) (Liu et al., 2004a, b; Saikali et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008), and other antigens associated with proliferation and cell survival (hTERT, Survivin, B-cyclin, Her-2/neu) (Katoh et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004a; Saikali et al., 2007; Ueda et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). Recent studies have additionally suggested that many human gliomas are latently infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Cobbs et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2008), and that CMV may be a clinically relevant target for immune-based therapies (Prins et al., 2008a).",

A similar attempt to identify antigens recognized by the immune system in an IL-4-secreting rat 9L glioma immunization successfully identified mouse Id-associated protein 1 (MIDA) as an antigen that could induce antitumor immunity (Okada et al., 2001). In human gliomas, however, attempts to identify T-cell antigens have been less successful (Pallasch et al., 2005; Schmits et al., 2002). Nevertheless, some recent studies have demonstrated that many established human glioma cell lines express well-characterized TAAs that can be recognized by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (Zhang et al., 2007). Interestingly, the pattern of antigen expression seems to differ between adult and pediatric human gliomas (Okada et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008).",

            "text": "With the rapid advances provided by high throughput microarray chip technology, the entire compendium of genes showing elevated expression in tumors will soon be established, and the repertoire of potential glioma-specific antigens defined (Horvath et al., 2006; Liau et al., 2000; Mischel et al., 2003a, b). Furthermore, recent progress in our understanding of tumor immunology can link the information generated from gene-expression profiling of CNS tumors to the identification of precise immunogenic epitopes that can serve as useful targets for specific immunotherapy (Freije et al., 2004). For instance, since T cells can only recognize antigens in the context of MHC, tumor-associated genes can be scrutinized for amino acid sequences that can interact with relevant MHC molecules and efficiently bind via the proteosomal degradation system. Candidate tumor-specific peptide epitopes for CTLs can now be identified using available computer algorithms that predict the MHC binding affinities of specific peptide and epitope sequences (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/, http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/kxi/). By subsequently testing the stability of MHC molecules with candidate tumor-specific peptides in vitro, an estimation of the potential immunogenicity of an in silico-identified antigen can be determined (Maecker et al., 2001). The immunogenicity of human cancer genes or their predicted CTL peptide epitopes can also be assessed in animal models using HLA transgenic mice (Butterfield et al., 2001), providing even better estimates for immunotherapy targets in vivo. Recently, experiments involving the screening of human tumor samples for CTL reactivity have identified human glioma-associated antigen epitopes to EphA2 and IL13R\u03b1 specifically recognized by the immune system and associated with extended survival (Okano et al., 2002; Ueda et al., 2007). Based on these recent advances, it is suggested that cancer genomics can be directly linked to tumor immunotherapy by \u201creverse immunology,\u201d which paves the way for the design of new, more specific targets for brain tumor immunotherapy.",

Sometimes, these cells are injected into the tumor cavity to maximize the exposure of the infused cells to tumor cells, while other strategies call for systemic infusion. Cytolytic effector cells are cultured in vitro with cytokines to activate them to attack tumor tissue in vivo. This approach was not clinically applicable until the discovery of IL-2 and other cytokines that modulate T-cell growth and survival. Before that time, it was not possible to obtain sufficient numbers of immune cells and maintain them in culture during the in vitro sensitization period. IL-2, originally called T-cell growth factor, is a cytokine that mediates lymphocyte activation and stimulates division.",

Preclinical studies in rat and murine glioma models first demonstrated that polyclonal, glioma-specific T cells could eradicate CNS gliomas (Baldwin et al., 1997; Kruse et al., 1990; Plautz et al., 1997; Rice et al., 1997) and was associated with enhanced trafficking of these lymphocytes to the brain (Hazelrigg et al., 2002). Subsequent work demonstrated that the draining LN population, from which these lymphocytes are isolated, also includes suppressor populations that can impair the efficacy of the adoptively transferred population (Peng et al., 2002). Removal of the CD62Lhigh population enriched the lymphocyte population with enhanced antitumor activity (Plautz et al., 1997). This contrasts with other recent studies on adoptive immunity, in which clonally derived CD8+ T lymphocytes were used. In this case, the CD62L+ population identified CD8+ T cells of the central memory phenotype that possess enhanced trafficking, expansion, and survival (Klebanoff et al., 2005). Different models may account for the differences observed but suggest that careful characterization of the cellular infusate is critical for antitumor activity.",

In an adoptive transfer model where antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were polarized to a type 1 (Tc1) cytokine profile using IL-12 and blocking antibodies to IL-4 (Nishimura et al., 2006), the T cells showed preferential homing to intracranial tumors (probably due to high expression of VLA-4/\u03b14\u03b21 integrin, as discussed above) and enhanced antitumor efficacy (Sasaki et al., 2007). Other work has demonstrated that chemokines, such as tumor-derived monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) Desbaillets et al., 1999, can be sufficient to mediate the tropism of tumor-specific T cells to intracranial tumors (Brown et al., 2007). Most recent studies have also demonstrated that tumor-specific CD8+ T cells primed with antigen, IL-2, and IL-15 can lead to enhanced trafficking to intracranial tumors and migration through the cervical LNs, spleen, and bone marrow (Prins et al., 2008b). In this adoptive transfer setting, endogenous host cytokines are also important for the survival and effector functions of the transferred cells. Host lymphodepletion, via whole body radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy, can facilitate the homeostatic expansion of adoptively transferred T cells by improved competition for endogenous cytokines (Gattinoni et al., 2005), such as IL-7 and IL-15, eliminating endogenous regulatory T cells (Chang et al., 1986) and/or enhancing the intratumoral accumulation of the transferred cells (Wang et al., 2005).",

The advantage of using such materials is that this approach is applicable against neoplasms for which immunogenic tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens are unknown. The disadvantages, however, are that such autologous tumor extracts may be heterogeneous and are therefore difficult to characterize and quantitate. Also, the use of unfractionated tumor material may lead to relatively low concentrations of effective immunogens in the mixture, as antigenic tumor peptides may conceivably be diluted by relatively non-immunogenic proteins and thereby lower the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Furthermore, a risk for inducing immunity against self-antigens that may lead to autoimmune encephalitis is real (Bigner et al., 1981).",

As such, it was demonstrated that tumor-specific, MHC class I-restricted peptides can be pulsed onto DCs and used to induce significant antitumor immunity to intracranial tumors (Ciesielski et al., 2008; Hatano et al., 2004; Heimberger et al., 2002, 2003; Prins et al., 2003). Similarly, viral transduction of DCs with tumor antigens (Broder et al., 2003), cytokines (Kim et al., 2006; Tsugawa et al., 2004; Yamanaka et al., 2003b), and/or fusions of DCs and tumor cells (Kjaergaard et al., 2005) has generated antitumor immunity that is being translated into clinical trials. Currently, DCs are recognized as a promising vehicle for active immunotherapy of cancer. Numerous animal experiments have demonstrated the potential of DC-based immunotherapy in both protecting mice from tumor formation and eliminating established tumors. However, other work has shown that DC vaccination is more effective at priming tumor-specific T-cell responses but relatively inefficient for boosting the same response (Jouanneau et al., 2006). Thus, there is a rationale for incorporating DC vaccination with chemotherapy, adjuvants, and/or viral vectors that may synergize to induce therapeutic antitumor immunity.",

            "text": "It is becoming clear from preclinical studies and human trials that enhancement of DC vaccines with adjuvants will be required to generate an antitumor immune response that is both reproducibly effective and long lasting. DCs express numerous TLRs (see above) that are important in host defense against bacteria and other microbial pathogens (Barrat and Coffman, 2008; Barton and Medzhitov, 2002; Pulendran, 2005). Stimulation of TLRs ultimately results in gene expression profiles that lead to the production of cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12 as well as type I and type II IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) (Barton and Medzhitov, 2002; Pulendran, 2005). TLR ligation on DC induces a maturational signal that can up-regulate MHC and costimulatory molecule expression, induce migration to LNs, and induce expression of cytokines that can promote and enhance T-cell priming against tumors (Steinman and Banchereau, 2007). Since it is commonly believed that activated DCs can prime T-cell responses more effectively (Steinman and Banchereau, 2007), numerous groups have utilized adjuvants to effectively mature DCs for cancer immunotherapy. For example, the TLR-7 agonist, imiquimod (Aldara\u00ae), could synergize with peptide-pulsed DC vaccination paradigms to induce effective antitumor immunity to intracranial tumors (Prins et al., 2006b). Imiquimod enhanced not only DC survival and trafficking to LNs but also the priming of self, tumor antigen-specific T cells (Prins et al., 2006b). Similar findings were reported with poly-ICLC, a TLR-3 agonist (Zhu et al., 2007), and CpG, a TLR-9 agonist (Wu et al., 2007).",

Tregs (see above) have recently been shown to accumulate in the peripheral blood and tumors of mice (Grauer et al., 2007) and patients (El Andaloussi and Lesniak, 2007; Fecci et al., 2006a) with malignant glioma, and this was associated with the degree of malignancy and immune competency (El Andaloussi and Lesniak, 2007; Fecci et al., 2006a; Heimberger et al., 2008; Learn et al., 2006). These data suggest that a tumor-derived factor may influence this type of immune evasion so as to prevent proper immune surveillance of tumors arising in the CNS. As such, recent studies have demonstrated that blockade of the negative costimulatory molecule, CTLA-4, can ameliorate changes to the CD4+ T-cell compartment and confer long-term survival in intracranial tumor-bearing animals (Fecci et al., 2007). Similarly, others have recently demonstrated that functional blockade of Tregs with in vivo CD25 mAb administration can enhance the antitumor immunity to vaccines in a prophylactic setting (Fecci et al., 2006b; Grauer et al., 2008). However, these studies highlight the difficulties of Treg depletion, since the CD25 mAb (PC61) used therein can also bind and inhibit activated T cells, completely removing any beneficial effect of an active vaccination immunotherapy in established intracranial tumor-bearing mice (Curtin et al., 2008). Such studies highlight the importance of the T-cell compartment in CNS tumor immunity. New methodologies are being explored to functionally reverse the Treg influence in combination with antitumor vaccination strategies.",

Such cytokine-secreting tumors revealed that multiple facets of the cellular immune response could be mobilized to induce antitumor immunity. Other groups have utilized intracranial injections of viral vectors, which encode cytokines and/or conditional cytotoxicity (HSV-TK) (Ali et al., 2005; Curtin et al., 2005) (see also chapters 46 and 47).",

Antigens expressed by LM can access both MHC class I and class II processing pathways and are presented to both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Additionally, LM has been shown to stimulate TLRs (Barton and Medzhitov, 2002) on the surface of APC and activate internal pattern recognition molecules, which may contribute to its immuno-stimulatory action (Ulevitch, 2004). In published studies, it has been demonstrated that immunization with an attenuated, recombinant Listeria monocytogenes\n(rLM) expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP) led to the rejection of a glioma expressing the heterologous NP antigen (Liau et al., 2002). Interestingly, animals clearing these tumors were subsequently immune to re-challenge with subcutaneous and intracranial glioma cells that did not express NP, suggesting that epitope spreading had occurred, which is a phenomenon whereby T cells can recognize other endogenous glioma epitopes along with the targeted antigen(s) (Liau et al., 2002). Given the heterogeneity of human brain tumors and the possibility for the immune escape, exploiting the process of epitope spreading will be valuable in the clinical context of future tumor vaccine design. These studies reveal the complexity of the multiple mechanisms by which antitumor immunity can be generated.",

LAK cells have been implanted into the resection cavity during surgery (Dillman et al., 2004; Hayes et al., 1995; Merchant et al., 1988a, b), and sporadic clinical responses were observed. However, LAK cell therapy is nonspecific in that the cells are not stimulated in vitro with any glioma-specific antigens. The limitations of LAK cell adoptive transfer to eradicate tumor cells in clinical trials may be due to its inherent non-specificity, the fact that cells do not migrate efficiently to tumor sites, and/or the induction of diffuse cerebral edema from IL-2 and other cytokines.",

The theory is that antigen-stimulated CTLs would be more specific than LAK cells.

Contrary to other antibody-based approaches, which call for injection of massive doses of purified antibodies, a recent study has shown tumor regression in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients by treating patients with very low doses of recombinant bispecific antibodies (blinatumomab), which render the cancer cells sensitive to almost all CTLs that they may encounter (Bargou et al., 2008).

This strategy involves ex vivo exposure of a patient's DCs to their tumor antigen followed by their in vivo infusion to stimulate an endogenous immune response (Liau et al., 1999; Prins et al., 2003). The theory behind this therapeutic strategy is based upon evidence that tumor cells are poor APCs, and do not adequately stimulate endogenous professional APCs. The lack of immune activation may affect not only CD8+ T cells but also the CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells (Th) that require antigen presentation in association with MHC class II. Unless tumor antigens are secreted as soluble proteins and can be processed by professional APCs, the CTL response will be handicapped by the lack of critical Th function such as cytokine secretion and full DC activation. Soluble antigen may be released by tumor cells in later stages with the development of necrotic areas; but by this time, the tumor may be past the threshold from which its growth can be impeded by immune activity. To circumvent this, investigators are using ex vivo cytokine stimulation of DC and antigen exposure of autologous DCs with autologous tumor lysate, tumor peptides, or tumor cell fusions (Table 48.3)\n.\n",

Patients received standard of care, which included surgery followed by external beam radiation therapy. Glioma cells were dissociated from the tumor specimen and cultured in vitro. After approximately 5 weeks in culture, MHC-bound tumor peptides were eluted from the surface of the tumor cells using an acid-elution protocol (Liau et al., 1999). The patient\u2019s own autologous DCs were then harvested from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and subsequently loaded with the autologous acid-eluted tumor peptides. The patients then received three intradermal injections of peptide-pulsed DCs at 2-week intervals. Although this phase I study was not powered to detect clinical efficacy, it provided further evidence on the feasibility, safety, and in vivo bioactivity of autologous peptide-pulsed DCs in patients with glioblastoma, as did other similar studies (Kikuchi et al., 2004, 2001; Liau et al., 2005; Yajima et al., 2005; Yamanaka et al., 2003a; Yu et al., 2004, 2001). Although admittedly a select population of patients, prolonged survival times and significant immunological responses were observed in some of these patients, which supports the possibility of an immune-related effect on tumor control. A recent study correlated quantitative T-cell immune responses, as measured by IFN-\u03b3 enhancement, with clinical time to tumor progression (TTP) and survival (Wheeler et al., 2008). Proof of clinical benefit from DC-based vaccines remains to be established in future multi-center phase II clinical trials for malignant glioma patients, which are currently underway.",

It should be noted that as with any other targeted treatment modality for brain tumors, immunotherapy trials might only realize significant potential clinical efficacy if given to the appropriate subgroup of patients and/or if administered in combination with other therapies. With the current experience in cancer treatments, it appears that simultaneously targeting several components essential to the neoplastic process should provide maximal chances of tumor control. Therefore, therapies based on immuno-enhancement and cancer vaccines could be combined with the traditional surgery, radiation, and chemotherapies, along with molecularly targeted biological agents. Such integrated treatment strategies may prove to be of low toxicity and should be synergistic. In addition, the combined use of conventional treatments within the context of clinical trials of immunotherapy will allow evaluation of efficacy, yet retain the ethical requirements for human investigation.",

Resident or recruited APC (i) phagocytose tumor-derived antigen (e.g., cellular debris) and transport it to LNs (ii). Tumor antigens can also arrive in the LN following peripheral vaccination (iii). Immigrant DC or LN resident DC presents antigen to na\u00efve T cells, leading to their activation and clonal expansion (iv). Activated T cells exit the LN and infiltrate the site of tumor growth (v) to exert their effector functions",

Na\u00efve T cells are activated (primed) in secondary lymphoid tissue by DCs that are able to present tumor antigens (i.e., exogenous antigens) on MHC class I (cross-presentation) and MHC class II molecules to CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively. In addition, all DCs present endogenous antigens to CD8 T cells. The DCs also express costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80/CD86) that deliver a second signal to receptors on the T cells, ensuring T-cell activation rather than tolerance (see text)",
