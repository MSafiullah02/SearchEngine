Subsequently, the labeled virions or molecules can be tracked in real time. Here, we reviewed the recent applications of click reactions in virus-related research, including viral tracking, the design of antiviral agents, the diagnosis of viral infection, and virus-based delivery systems.

In this system, an alkyne group was quantitatively attached to the tyrosine residues on the surface of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) via diazonium coupling and the CuAAC reaction (Bruckman et al., 2008) . This study also proved that the CuAAC reaction did not depend on the structure of the starting materials and will not affect the function of the azide (Bruckman et al., 2008) . However, copper-catalyzed ligation between Cu(II) and 1,2,3-triazoles has cytotoxicity and might affect the viral structure Wang et al., 2003) . Moreover, Cu(II) can greatly decrease the fluorescence of the quantum dots (QDs) (Beaune et al., 2011; Bernardin et al., 2010) . Therefore, a copper-free reaction was used to label the vaccinia virus and avian influenza A virus in live cells with QDs by linking azideclicked virions to the dibenzocyclooctyne-derived QDs, resulting in intact, fluorescence-labeled and infectious virions for single-virion tracking, with an 80% labeling efficiency (Fig. 1a) (Hao et al., 2012) .

One protocol is based on genetic code expansion. First, an amber stop codon (UAG) was introduced into the target protein by site-directed mutagenesis (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Nikic et al., 2014) . Then, a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) could be incorporated into the amber stop codon when the engineered protein was coexpressed with the aminoacyl tRNA synthase/tRNA pair in the host cell, resulting in translation continuing through the amber stop codon, which was designated as amber suppression (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Nikic et al., 2014) . As the ncAA bears a ring-strained alkyne or alkene, the ncAA is clicked to azide-or tetrazine-containing dyes via SPAAC or SPIEDAC reactions, and thus, the mobility of the target viral protein, such as HIV-1 Env, can be measured in a real-time manner (Fig. 1b) (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Nikic et al., 2014; Sakin et al., 2017) . Moreover, HIV-1 particles can be generated by adding eGFP-tagged Gag to the system, and therefore, the Env accumulating sites of particle budding can be visualized by stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Sakin et al., 2017) . However, the Fig. 1 . Application of click chemistry in viral tracking. (a) Virions were labeled with quantum dots (QDs) via copper-free click chemistry by linking azide-clicked virions to the dibenzocyclooctyne-derived QDs, resulting in intact, fluorescence-labeled and infectious virions (Hao et al., 2012) . (b) An amber (UAG) stop codon was inserted into the HIV Env protein by site-directed mutagenesis, followed by coexpression of the protein with an aminoacyl tRNA synthase/tRNA and noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) in the target cell (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Sakin et al., 2017) . Subsequently, the ncAA was incorporated at the amber stop codon, allowing the continuous translation through the amber stop codon (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Sakin et al., 2017) . When H-Tet-Cy5 was added, the Env was labeled between ncAA and tetrazine via a click reaction (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Sakin et al., 2017) . (c) Viral glycoprotein was labeled with a metabolically incorporated unnatural sugar (Ac4ManNAz), followed by a click reaction with organic fluorescent dyes, allowing virus-cell fusion to be visualized during the infection . efficiency of amber suppression used in this strategy was low (Fernandez and Freed, 2017; Plass et al., 2012; Sakin et al., 2017) , which limits the incorporation of ncAA into the target protein. Another metabolic incorporation strategy describes the labeling of the viral membrane glycoprotein via metabolic incorporation of unnatural sugars (Ac4ManNAz) followed by a click-reaction with organic fluorescent dyes, allowing the visualization of the fusion of a single virus with cells during the infection (Fig. 1c) . The result showed that unnatural sugars did not affect membrane fusion, while it can interfere with the function of the Env . Moreover, the methionine analogue homopropargylglycine (HPG) was also used for incorporation into newly synthesized protein of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) using click chemistry (Su Hui Teo et al., 2016) . Due to that the HPG can be selectively coupled by fluorochrome-capture reagents, the newly synthesized proteins can be tracked by a fluorescence microscope. The results showed that the newly synthesized proteins were rapidly accumulated in the nucleus and formed numerous subcompartments (Su Hui Teo et al., 2016) . The immediate-early proteins ICP4 and ICP0 of HSV were excluded from these newly synthesized protein domains (NPDs), whereas ICP22 was selectively recruited in the NPDs, and the NPDs formed adjacent to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) domains (Su Hui Teo et al., 2016) . These results indicated that NPDs recruit host and newly translated viral protein during the early stage of infection (Su Hui Teo et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 217, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 218, "end": 235, "text": "Lin et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 236, "end": 255, "text": "Nikic et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 256, "end": 275, "text": "Plass et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 276, "end": 295, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 448, "end": 475, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 476, "end": 495, "text": "Nikic et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 798, "end": 825, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 826, "end": 845, "text": "Nikic et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1136, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1156, "text": "Nikic et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1176, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1420, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1440, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1751, "text": "(Hao et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 2010, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2030, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2163, "end": 2190, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2191, "end": 2210, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2307, "end": 2334, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2354, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2644, "end": 2671, "text": "(Fernandez and Freed, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2672, "end": 2691, "text": "Plass et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2711, "text": "Sakin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3406, "end": 3431, "text": "(Su Hui Teo et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3722, "end": 3747, "text": "(Su Hui Teo et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3989, "end": 4014, "text": "(Su Hui Teo et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 4135, "end": 4160, "text": "(Su Hui Teo et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1099, "end": 1108, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1462, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3088, "end": 3097, "text": "(Fig. 1c)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Viral tracking"}, {"text": "In addition to viral protein, viral nucleic acids can also be labeled using click chemistry to track the dynamics of the nucleic acids.

Thereafter, viral transcription can be visualized and quantified in the virus-infected cells through fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively (Kalveram et al., 2013) . It was found that newly synthesized viral RNA and nonstructural protein (NSP) were colocalized with dsRNA in the early stages of infection of Coronaviruses but not in the late stages of infection, indicating that dsRNA does not play a necessary role in activating viral RNA synthesis (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) . However, both nascent viral RNA and host transcripts can be labeled using this protocol (Kalveram et al., 2013) . To solve this problem, virus-infected cells can be treated with actinomycin D (ActD) to suppress host cell transcription, as ActD can inhibit DNA-dependent transcription by binding to dsDNA but has no effect on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Kalveram et al., 2013; Reich and Goldberg, 1964) .

Using 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU)-labeled HSV-1 DNA, it was found that promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) blocked viral replication by entrapping viral DNA during the entry of the viral genome into the nucleus (Alandijany et al., 2018) . However, when the viral PML-NB antagonist ICP0 was added, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression was induced in a PML-, interferon gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16)-, and Janus-associated kinase (JAK)-dependent manner, while the ISG expression was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid, indicating that viral DNA polymerase was involved in the induction of ISG expression (Alandijany et al., 2018) . These results demonstrated that PML played dual roles in the regulation of intracellular host immunity, which depended on viral genome delivery and viral DNA polymerase, respectively (Alandijany et al., 2018) . Senkevich and colleagues incorporated EdU into the nascent DNA of the vaccinia virus (VACV) in the virus-infected cells and found that the newly synthesized DNA was colocalized with the viral single-stranded DNA binding protein I3 in virus factories surrounded by the endoplasmic reticulum (Senkevich et al., 2017) . Further research demonstrated that nuclear DNA synthesis stopped immediately after VACV infection, whereas the synthesis of viral DNA was enhanced in the virus factories of the cytoplasm (Senkevich et al., 2017) . Viral proteins, host proteins (including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as well as topoisomerases II\u03b1 and II\u03b2) as well as nascent viral DNA were identified in the complexes, indicating that these proteins were required for poxvirus DNA replication (Senkevich et al., 2017) . Unexpectedly, it was demonstrated that EdU has cytotoxic properties, which may be responsible for cell death and/or apoptosis (Cieslar-Pobuda and Los, 2013; Kohlmeier et al., 2013) .

Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are important antigenic determinants on the surface of the influenza virus. Therefore, HA and NA are key targets for the development of anti-influenza agents. Nagao and coworkers designed glycopolymers carrying sialyl oligosaccharides by click chemistry and found that the glycopolymers can specifically recognize different types of influenza viruses (Fig. 2a ) (Nagao et al., 2017) . Among the glycopolymers, GP4-6\u2032 can significantly inhibit viral infection by interacting with viral hemagglutinin (Nagao et al., 2017) . Excitingly, many groups reported that multivalent antibodies or ligands generated by click chemistry exhibited high anti-influenza activity. Multivalent interactions with multiple binding sites of the virus were found to be more efficient in inhibiting viral infection, and the lipidation of the polymer structures played an important role in inhibiting the viral infection (Nagao et al., 2017) . Similarly, human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated with S-sialoside showed moderate NA inhibitory activity and higher affinity to HA due to the multivalent effect as well as optimized three-dimensional presentation of sialosides on the protein (Yang et al., 2016) . To overcome the intrinsic limitations of the conventional influenza vaccine, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were conjugated with HA and flagellin (TLR5 agonist) by click chemistry, resulting in specific and stable conjugated proteins (Wang et al., 2017) . The dual-conjugated AuNPs are effective in inducing a strong immune response in vitro and in mice, indicating that the proteins have effective immunogenicity and immunostimulation (Wang et al., 2017) . Furthermore, per-O-methylated cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives functionalized with multivalent pentacyclic triterpene were synthesized using a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition click reaction (Tian et al., 2017) . Compound 28 showed the most potent anti-influenza activity by being tightly bound to influenza HA protein to inhibit the entry of the influenza virus into the host cell (Tian et al., 2017) .

A cocktail of thermally stable capture agents generated using click chemistry can be used to detect the anti-gp41 antibodies of HIV-1 from human sera with high sensitivity and specificity (Pfeilsticker et al., 2013) . To increase the sensitivity of the biosensor, a variable domain of llama heavy-chain antibodies, which can specifically recognize the foot-and-mouth disease virus, was clicked with azides to generate bioorthogonal reactive groups (Trilling et al., 2014) . The sensitivity of the resulting biosensor increased up to 800-fold compared with that of randomly oriented bioreceptors, indicating that the device may facilitate early diagnosis (Trilling et al., 2014) . To detect infection by the dengue fever virus (DENV), an automated biosensing platform was designed by coating high-affinity monoclonal antibodies of DENV biomarker NS1 protein via bio-orthogonal Cu-free click chemistry (Fig. 3a) (Antunes et al., 2015) . The resulting biosensor takes only 8 min for DENV detection using a 6 \u03bcL serum sample, and the detection limit of the method was 25 ng/mL (Antunes et al., 2015) . Recently, a boron-doped diamond (BBD) electrode clicked with sialic acid-mimic peptide, a common receptor of influenza viruses, was designed to capture influenza virions during the early stages of infection (Fig. 3b) (Matsubara et al., 2016) . Using the BBD, 20-500 pfu of H1N1 and H3N2 virions can be detected, indicating that the BDD device integrated with the receptor-mimic peptide has high sensitivity in the early phase of infection (Matsubara et al., 2016) .

The result showed that the detection limit was 0.13 nM using the PEDOT-based biosensor (Galan et al., 2015) .
