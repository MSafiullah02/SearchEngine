Sinus disease may be a part of multisystem or systemic conditions that frequently also involve the nasal passages, eyes, upper and lower airways, and even the gastrointestinal tract. It has been proposed that parts of the human airway from top to bottom, including the nasal passages, sinuses, pharynx, bronchi, and bronchioles, are all of the same histomorphological makeup. The corollary of this theory is that a common airway will be uniformly susceptible to any insults or disease processes. Diseases of the lower and upper respiratory tract, therefore, are all intricately linked. The truth is, as always, not that simple. The reason for the interrelationships between these diseases may not be simply based on a single airway theory, but on systemic changes in immunologic paradigms of the individual during his or her lifetime. For example, immunologic and autoimmune conditions that affect both the sinuses and the lower airway are well known, as in the case of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis). The immunologic basis that leads to the susceptibility of both sinuses and lower airways in these diseases is a subject of ongoing research.",

This theory has in fact never been proven, and modern studies have revealed that radiolabeled allergen introduced into the nose found its way not to the lower respiratory system, but to the digestive system [3, 4]. This does not, on the other hand, discount the possibility of upper airway pathology influencing lower airway symptoms. Even in the absence of direct contact or direct transmission of the inciting agent, other mechanisms may be in play.",

The rates vary from region to region, but a comprehensive review of the literature presented by Cruz et al. in their ARIA report describes coexistence of these two conditions in almost all regions of the world [7]. One of the exceptions was in certain areas in China, where only 6.2 % of asthmatic patients described concurrent nasal rhinitis symptoms. The rates of asthma in rhinitis patients and vice versa are presented in Table 11.1. Much of the available data on the impact of allergic rhinitis on asthma is derived from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). Perennial rhinitis is considered to be a risk factor for nonatopic asthma [20, 21]. In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, evaluation of 20\u201344-year-old subjects revealed that asthma is more common in patients with both atopic and nonatopic individuals. Moreover, even in nonasthmatic patients, those with symptoms of rhinitis were more likely to have concurrent bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In a study in Rochester, Minnesota, health-care costs for patients with concurrent asthma and allergic rhinitis were found to be higher than for patients with asthma alone [22].\n",

In allergic patients with BHR, they found that BHR and FeNO levels increased during the pollen season [29]. Further evidence of the link between rhinitis and asthma is presented in a study on 20 grass allergic patients, in whom a number of functional and inflammatory parameters including nasal airflow, FEV1, eosinophils, IL4, and interferon-\u03b3 levels were measured. A Th2 cytokine profile correlated with airway flow and was present in both the upper and lower airways [30]. Studies such as these establish a link that supports the unified airway concept.",

This finding was further confirmed by Brinke et al., who discovered that the frequency of abnormal CT scans in severe asthma patients was 84 %. They also noted that there was a correlation between sinusitis in severe asthma patients and sputum eosinophilia, providing an additional link between the upper and lower airways [38].

Both the lower and upper airway mucosae consist of a pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium which covers a reticular basement membrane. Ciliated cells predominate over goblet cells, and triangular basal cells also populate the tracheal and bronchial epithelium [50]. The basal cells are small cells which attach to the basement membrane [51, 52]. Under the basal cells lies the subepithelium or lamina propria. Blood vessels populated the submucosa, along with nerves, mucous glands, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and other vascular elements. The bronchioles of the lower airway also possess airway smooth muscle cells arranged in a helical pattern, while the nasal mucosa has more subepithelial capillaries and venous cavernous sinusoids. Clara cells are more unique to the lower airway and predominately exist in the membranous bronchioles. Clara cell-specific protein may have a role in the generation of local inflammatory responses in the airway (Table 11.3) [53]. In the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles are cartilage that starts in the upper airway and gradually becomes less prominent toward the periphery of the lung. The 18\u201320 C-shaped rings in the trachea become even less complete rings in the bronchi and disappear by a bronchiolar diameter of about 1 mm.\n",

The authors found that the number of eosinophils was elevated in patients with rhinitis, whether or not they had asthma, when compared with the atopic non-symptomatic group and the control group. Thickening of the reticular basement membrane in both the upper and lower airways was also detected in the former two groups in a manner similar to the eosinophilia findings. In all groups of atopic individuals, there was significantly increased epithelial desquamation. Airway remodeling, defined as a change in structure of the mucosa and submucosa of the airway, specifically epithelial fragility, thickening of the reticular basement membrane, airway smooth muscle mass increase, and fibrosis [58], was detectable in the lower airway but not in the nasal mucosa. The reverse is also true whereby evidence of inflammatory markers in upper airways has been detected in patients with lower airway disease, including nonallergic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [5]. Nitric oxide, a marker of inflammation, has been attributed to both lower airway inflammation and nasal polyposis. A study of surgical tissue from 15 patients with nasal polyps demonstrated an increase in all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthetase in leukocytes from nasal polyp tissue which contrasts from normal middle turbinate tissue [59].",

In addition, an increase in bronchial eosinophilia was also detected [61]. Immunologic unity has also been demonstrated in human studies. A correlation between IL-4, interferon-\u03b3, eosinophilia in nasal cytology specimens, nasal airflow, and airway function (FEV1) was detected in a study of 20 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma [30]. A nasal allergen provocation study showed that out of season nasal introduction of grass pollen leads to the infiltration of eosinophils into the epithelium and lamina propria of both the nasal and bronchial mucosae 24 h after nasal provocation. In addition, increased levels of ICAM-1 and an increase in the percentage of CD31 vascular endothelial expression of ICAM1, E-selectin, and VCAM1 were detected in the nasal and bronchial mucosae. The authors concluded that out of season nasal provocation in patients with grass allergy leads to inflammatory infiltrates and cytokine and chemokine expression in both the upper and lower airways [62].",

The authors conducted the nasal challenge at the beginning of the study in July (considered a low exposure time) and at the end of the study (during the winter which was considered a high exposure season). The results showed that baseline nasal IgE levels were higher in the summertime compared to winter. Also elevated from baseline in allergic or asthmatic subjects compared to controls were sputum ECP and exhaled nitric oxide eNO levels. The response to nasal challenge in asthmatics was mixed, with 3/15 asthmatics experiencing an increase in ECP in summer but 11/15 experiencing the increase in the wintertime. A similar result was seen in the rhinitis patients. Again, a more frequent response in eNO to nasal challenge was seen in the winter compared to the summer. The link between lower airway and upper airway is perhaps best illustrated in this study from the observed increase in sputum ECP and eNO levels in asthmatic children in winter upon nasal challenge with dust mite allergen. However, in rhinitis patients, only the increase in eNO was detected after challenge in winter.",

It is known that rhinovirus binds to an intracellular adhesion molecule, leading to infection of airway epithelial cells. Included among the many functions that are mediated by activation of NF\u03baB is the upregulation of an adhesion molecule known as intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Binding of rhinovirus to ICAM-1 allows rhinovirus to enter airway epithelial cells and leads to further activation of other proinflammatory mediators, which subsequently leads to recruitment of other proinflammatory cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. This positive feedback loop involving upregulation of the expression of ICAM-1 opens the door for further infection by rhinovirus. What results is the induction of an inflammatory state that is enhanced by the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, and IL-16. Further recruitment of inflammatory cells to the bronchial tree can ultimately lead to lower airway inflammatory symptoms, including cough, wheezing, and dyspnea [70].",

Increased G-CSF levels lead to higher neutrophil counts and activity and may play a role in the increased inflammatory state at sites distant from the upper airway.

So what is it about lung mucosa that renders it less prone to the development of polyps? The authors suggest that this observation could be explained by comparing differing mucosal characteristics of the nose and the lung. One factor that stands out is TGF-\u03b2 which plays an important role in the remodeling process. Epithelial injury results from increased TGF-\u03b2, which is upregulated in asthmatics and downregulated in nasal polyposis. On the other hand, the presence of TGF-\u03b2 in the lung prevents the development of polyps. In the nose, the nasal reticular basement membrane becomes less thickened which is a feature of nasal polyposis. Incidentally, TGF-\u03b2 also plays a protective role in the development of benign polyps in the large intestine as well, in that a mutation of SMAD4 disrupts TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in juvenile polyposis syndrome.",

Bucca has reported that increased lower airway hyperresponsiveness occurs in patients with sinusitis. In some of these patients, the increased airway hyperresponsiveness also included extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness, as measured by MIF50. The authors suggested that the mechanism by which this occurs is through activation of a nasopharyngeal-bronchial reflex. A study of 24 nonasthmatic patients with sinusitis investigated the relationship between pharyngeal mucosal changes and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The authors used histamine PC20 as a threshold for bronchial responsiveness and PC25MIF50 as a threshold for extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. In these patients, they found that the epithelial thinning, representing pharyngeal mucosa damage, correlated with extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was also associated with long-standing sinusitis, increased submucosal nerve density, increased eosinophils in the nasal lavage fluid, and a lower PC25MIF50. The authors interpreted these results as an indication that pharyngeal damage contributes to airway dysfunction through the stimulation of mucosal nerve endings to activate constrictive reflexes leading to increased extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. They also postulated that it is pharyngeal damage and the failure of normal physiologic filtering functions that grant access of irritants and allergens to submucosal nerve endings [81].",

Intuitively, it seems to make sense that postnasal drip, facilitated by gravity, will end up in the lower airway. If the mucous contains allergic or inflammatory mediators, then an inflammatory response in the lower airways is expected. However, in two separate studies, nasal application of radioactive-labeled allergen only showed deposition in the digestive tract and not in the lower respiratory tract [3, 4]. In contrast, there have been studies to support the concept that a cough can be associated with postnasal drip [83\u201385], suggesting an alternative mechanism for the effect of upper airway secretions on lower airway inflammation. It is possible that aspiration of stomach contents may be responsible for a cough in these patients or that the stimulation of pharyngolaryngeal receptors by inflammatory mediators emanating may be the key mechanism for postnasal drip-related cough [86].",

Asthma is usually diagnosed 2\u20133 years after the onset of upper airway symptoms and is commonly difficult to treat. Nasal polyps are recurrent and frequently require multiple surgeries. The aspirin sensitivity usually occurs in these patients who were previously able to tolerate aspirin. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and its mode of action is through inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1. The result of this inhibition is an increase in the substrate arachidonic acid, leading to increased activity of the lipoxygenase pathway and the release of leukotrienes into the circulation and surrounding tissue. Leukotrienes are potent mediators of inflammation. The details of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease are discussed in other chapters of this book. This discussion will focus only on why this mechanism predisposes patients to disease of both the upper and lower airways, in the context of a unified airway disease.",

As early as the 1,800 s, William Osler had identified a link between the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, noting that overeating can induce coughing paroxysms in asthmatics [92]. In general, the majority of asthmatic subjects will describe having symptoms of reflux. Similarly, many patients with asthma will complain of respiratory symptoms related to reflux. Even to this day, it is not yet clear if asthma causes reflux or vice versa. A study on upper airway obstruction and gastroesophageal reflux performed in dogs suggested that it is the upper airway obstruction that causes gastroesophageal reflux by generation of a negative inspiratory pressure. Temporally, they showed that it was induction of the airway obstruction that led to gastroesophageal reflux about 1 week after creation of the obstruction [93]. Why abnormal pressures on the esophagus in airway obstruction can predispose patients to reflux can be explained by Bernoulli\u2019s principle [94]. Bernoulli\u2019s principle states that there is an inverse relationship between the velocity of a fluid through a tube and the pressure exerted perpendicularly by that fluid. On the other hand, it has been suggested that gastroesophageal reflux can trigger asthma through aspiration-induced inflammation resulting in hyperresponsiveness of the airway. In support of this concept, a review of the literature suggests that treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux improves asthma symptoms [95]. However, this has not been valid in the case of silent or asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. The effects of reflux on asthma thus remain unclear. It is probable that putting these two events together produces a vicious cycle, where one disease exacerbates the other. Treatment of either disease will break the cycle and improve symptoms.",

Part of this evidence included the observation that gastric acid contents can be found in the middle ear of patients with otitis media with effusion [96]. Additionally, Wong et al. showed that a hyperactive reflux can induce autonomic nervous system and lead to sinonasal edema, a compromise in normal drainage, and chronic rhinosinusitis [98]. This was previously described by Pinto et al. [97]. Thirdly, patients who had successful treatment of gastroesophageal reflux experienced a higher degree of resolution of sinus symptoms and global well-being [98, 99].

The presence of asthma and the use of inhaled corticosteroids were confounding variables that were controlled for in the study. Curiously, however, the use of intranasal corticosteroids, while presumed to be either an exclusion criteria or a variable that would be controlled for, was not specifically mentioned in the paper [101]. Earlier reports have also noted that allergic rhinitis patients who may benefit from immunotherapy were at least three times more likely to have dysphonia than normal controls [102]. Other investigators have also proposed a link between vocal cord problems and allergic rhinitis symptoms that may or may not be simply attributed to postnasal drainage [103, 104]. The relationship between sinusitis and voice abnormalities has also been proposed, and parameters necessary to evaluate vocal characteristics in sinusitis patients were established, although no differences in these parameters were detected in this pilot study of 10 chronic sinusitis and 9 control subjects.

Effective treatment of allergic rhinitis has been associated with a reduced frequency of emergency department visits for asthma and a reduced risk for hospitalization for asthma [108]. Antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis may have some benefit in asthma. Glucocorticoids, of course, will treat both areas of the respiratory tract, when applied \u201ctopically\u201d to that region. Perhaps more interesting is the effect of immunotherapy on asthma. Because it is believed that immunotherapy works on a systemic basis to modulate the immune system, then one might infer that immunotherapy used to treat allergic rhinitis should help with allergic asthma as well. In fact, numerous studies have supported the role of immunotherapy in asthma [109]. An illustration of the parallel strategies in treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma is shown in Table 11.4.\n",

The role of aspirin in sinusitis is discussed in the chapter on aspirin-induced sinus disease.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists have also been found to play a role in the treatment of chronic sinusitis. These conclusions have mostly been established through the study of leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of AERD whereby both asthma (the intended indication) and chronic sinusitis (unintended consequence) have shown improvement [113].",

IL-4 has been shown to be able to increase CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptor levels in eosinophils and lymphocytes. Thus, targeting of cytokine pathways may be a means to reduce the effects of leukotrienes.

A randomized controlled trial studying the effect of omalizumab on allergic rhinitis symptoms was conducted on 536 patients between the ages of 12 and 75 years [118]. Outcome measures included self-assessment of daily nasal symptom scores, antihistamine use, and quality-of-life assessments. Free IgE levels were also measured. The results indicated that omalizumab was an effective mode of therapy with improvements in all three outcome measures. No increase in adverse side effects was noted in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. Similar results were found in studies on the use of omalizumab in birch pollen- [119] and cedar pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis [120]. In the lower airway, Holgate et al. showed that omalizumab has similar beneficial effects in asthma, and patients were more likely to be able to reduce their inhaled corticosteroid usage with an accompanying reduction in asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits [121]. Quality-of-life improvements were also detected in the INNOVATE study, one of the earlier studies on the effectiveness of omalizumab in allergic asthma [122].

Other maintenance medications include the leukotriene receptor antagonists, montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, which, as a class effect, may be variably effective in treating symptoms of both the lower and upper respiratory tract. Antihistamines are useful in allergic rhinitis, and their role in allergic asthma is not quite so clear.

This study showed that biofilm-forming bacteria and asthma were independently associated with a risk for refractory chronic rhinosinusitis requiring revision endoscopic surgery. This would suggest that treatment of asthma may be an important factor in determining the efficacy of surgical treatment of sinus disease, illustrating the bidirectional nature of the association between asthma and sinus disease.",

            "text": "From ancient times, physicians have appreciated the connection between the upper airway and lower airway. Throughout history, the link has been consolidated, and our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms behind this link has been cultivated, and now it is no longer simply an intuitive or presumed relationship. Several mechanisms are in play, and these involve neural, vascular, immunologic, and physical pathways. It is now known that there are anatomical and histomorphological similarities between the upper and lower airways that would lead one to believe that effects on one part of the airway should be duplicated in other parts. However, there are also differences between the upper and lower airways. The relationship between the upper and lower airways may in fact be mediated by a multitude of factors. Nasobronchial reflexes may trigger vascular changes between the two parts of the airway. Allergen challenge to one part of the airway may trigger local changes that can lead to similar changes in other parts of the airway but may also mediate inflammatory effects by a systemic inflammatory response, leading to infiltration of inflammatory cells and generation of inflammatory cytokines in distant sites. It has been shown that this may involve the action of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and that Th1 cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 may actually provide a protective effect. There are similar cytological changes in nasal polyp tissue and lower airway tissue, but polyps themselves are not often seen in the lower airway. Further research on the pathologic mechanisms of upper and lower airway inflammation will bring about a better understanding of the similarities and differences of inflammation in these two areas of a contiguous organ and hopefully lead to better and safer therapeutic modalities.",
