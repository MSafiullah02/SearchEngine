            "text": ". The ECMO team was not available 3 times due to simultaneous calls. Only one ECMO was initiated during night shift. Four patients (50%) were discharged from ICU. Characteristics, outcomes and complications of patients were detailed in table 1. The role of ECMO in covid-19-related ARDS is still unclear. To date, only limited case-series are available. Our report is in accordance with previous reports on limited cases-series of Covid-19 patients under ECMO support. Li et al. reported a similar rate of 50% of weaning for 8 patients under ECMO 5 . Jacobs et al. in a larger case-series of 32 covid-19 patients under ECMO, have a weaning rate of 16% (5/32) but the majority of their ECMO treatment were still ongoing at time of publication 6 . To the contrary to other team, we performed only veno-venous ECMO therapies as all treated patients were hemodynamically stable without acute ventricular dysfunction 7 .To conclude, the setup of a mobile ECMO team within an experienced ECMO centre is feasible and may help to tackle the outbreak. To date, there is only limited case-series on ECMO for covid-19 patients and larger studies are mandatory to draw any conclusion.However, sharing experience between ECMO expert centers is necessary to improve our practice.",
