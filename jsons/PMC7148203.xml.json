Moreover, it can not deal with unseen words. There are also some models which recognize entities in character-level, which solve the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) [19].

The generic model mentioned above is shown in Fig. 1(a), these methods divide each sequence into several characters, and then represent these character vectors as a comprehensive representation through LSTM networks or other models. About word vectors, they concatenate each word vector with the representation of its corresponding characters, and then form a new multi-granularity representation of the word. In the process of generating the final word representation, the intermediate dimensional transformation may lead to original information loss. Moreover, for each word, the concatenation of the two granularity representations at the word-level does not express well the relationship between characters and words.

Different from the previously mentioned model, our model captures character content features and the information of token structure in word level (as shown in Fig. 1(b)). Our model uses two sequences of character and word segmentation as input, and outputs the final character-based recognition tags through the attention mechanism. The model preserves the character-level semantic representation and the word tokens structure completely, and uses self-attention to assign the weight of both. Multi-granularity semantic and structural features are combined with word representation to enrich character representation and reduce the loss of original information. Moreover, the character level and the word segmentation structure are complementary to each other, and a single character can correct the word boundary error caused by the word segmentation level.",

Early named entity recognition methods are based on rules and statistical machine learning such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [1], Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [12], and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [11]. In recent years, with the development of machine learning, more and more neural network models are used for the NER task. Collobert et al. [4] propose a unified neural network architecture that can be used in various NLP tasks. Zhou et al. [27] formulate Chinese NER as a joint identification and categorization task. Huang et al. [10] first apply BiLSTM-CRF model to NER, and achieve the advance results at that time. The BiLSTM-CRF model is now also the benchmark model for many pieces of research. Lample et al. [13] use BiLSTM-CRF as the basic model, rely on character-based word representations learned from the supervised corpus and unsupervised word representations learned from unannotated corpora. For Chinese NER, Zhang et al. [26] investigate a lattice-structured LSTM model, utilize information on words and character sequences, and solve the problem of Chinese words boundaries. Dong et al. [6] utilize both character-level and radical-level representations based on bidirectional LSTM-CRF. Besides, incorporating the five-stroke information into the network also achieves outstanding performance [24]. [14] add gazetteer-enhanced sub-tagger on hybrid semi-Markov CRF architecture and observe some promising results.

For example, Beijing People\u2019s Park is composed of Beijing/ people/ park. Compared with English, there is usually no need for prepositional connections in phrases, which leads to the poor distinction of the boundaries in long phrases. It is also a difficult point in the recognition of Chinese named entities. Dictionary-based word segmentation usually divides sentences into short words. For long phrases that do not appear in the dictionary, there is currently no good solution. This paper proposes a method to improve the above problem by using two granularity semantic representations to assist each other. The model uses the self-attention mechanism to calculate the similarity on different levels of representation subspace, sequentially calculates each character with all tokens in the total sequence. This method captures the structural information of the word sequence, in order to compute similarity and correlation with character context information to further identify the combined boundaries of the long phrases.",
