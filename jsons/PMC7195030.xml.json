            "text": "Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been gaining popularity over the past 2 decades as an atraumatic and a reliable approach for the management of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior cranial fossa lesions. Visual field defects, headaches, ophthalmoplegia, hypopituitarism, and hormone hypersecretion are common presentations of a pituitary adenoma, one of the most common sellar lesions.1, 2, 3 Microsurgical transsphenoidal approaches had been the gold standard for sellar and suprasellar procedures for decades before the introduction of EES into the neurosurgical field in the mid to late 1990s.2 The sellar and suprasellar EES technique was a translation from the field of otolaryngology, where it was initially used to replace the previous \u201copen\u201d method of sinus surgery.3 Microscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery had not evolved significantly since its introduction by Harvey Cushing in 1909, until the pioneering work of Hae-Dong Jho in 1997 at the University of Pittsburgh school of medicine.4 Jho et al5 demonstrated that endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches were possible for pituitary surgery and could facilitate faster postoperative recovery compared with the gold standard microsurgical approach. EES has continued to gain favorability over conventional microsurgical transsphenoidal approaches for sellar-suprasellar lesions whatever the size and type of the tumor due to the panoramic view of the surgical field, easier mobility of surgical instruments, and better views of anatomic corners with angled lenses.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n",

As well, neurosurgeons in favor of the traditional microscopic approach prefer maintaining stereoscopic vision and direct instrument visualization throughout the procedure. Initially, there were concerns regarding instrument maneuverability in EES; however, technologic advances such as the binarial endoscopic approach have resolved early concerns.14\n",

All patients received intravenous cefazolin 30 minutes before surgery and another single dose 8 hours after surgery, which is similar to previously reported regimens.20\n,\n21 After the patient was generally anesthetized and endotracheally intubated, the area of the nose was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Next, the otolaryngologist lateralized the middle turbinates bilaterally, followed by harvesting a vascularized unilateral nasoseptal flap. In recurrent cases, the vascularized nasoseptal flap of the contralateral side of the previous approach was harvested. Depending on the location and extent of the tumor, the bony access was expanded from the sphenoid to include transclival and/or transplanum exposure (extended endonasal) as needed. In the olfactory groove meningioma patient, the tumor was accessed through a transethmoid approach. The dura over the tumor was coagulated and opened in a cruciate fashion. The tumor excision/biopsy was carried out according to the pathology of the tumor. After excision/biopsy of the tumor, adequate hemostasis was achieved, followed by reconstruction of the skull base using a simple layer of Surgicel (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA), a layer of Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA); a small layer of fat graft in the sinus, followed by of Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA); and finally a vascularized nasoseptal flap (added only in the second half of patients). In cases of intraoperative high-flow CSF leak and extended approaches, an additional layer of inlay and onlay fascia lata graft were used. Valsalva maneuver was done to confirm no CSF leakage. Medialization of the middle turbinates were done as the final stage of the procedure.",

            "text": "It is difficult to evaluate or compare the extent of resection when discussing the many different types of sellar and suprasellar lesions that may be approached and resected through endoscopic endonasal surgery. Certain lesions require an attempt for GTR, while others, such as metastatic lesions, have high levels of success when combined with adjuvant therapy. Definitions of GTR, subtotal resection, decompression, and/or biopsy are unique and can vary for each study. In a review of 16 studies of giant adenomas, Komotar et al46 noted the microscopic transsphenoidal cohort had a lower rate of total resection and worse visual outcome than the endoscopic group. Pituitary adenomas are the most frequently studied and managed endoscopically. A 2018 metanalysis of 50 studies by Almutairi et al47 demonstrated a GTR rate for pituitary adenomas of 74%. For tumors invading the cavernous sinus, many authors noted a higher resection rate with an endoscope than a microscope, indicating the advantage of the panoramic and angled views of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus provided by endoscopes. In addition, endoscopic endonasal surgery has been reported to be a valid option for resection in recurrent adenomas.48 Graffeo et al49 demonstrated in their metanalysis that current GTR rates are 89.7% for olfactory groove meningiomas, 79.9% for tubercula sella meningiomas, 59% for craniopharyngiomas, and 58.8% for clival chordomas. Our series showed that GTR was achieved in 62.2% of pituitary adenomas, 50% of tuberculum sellae meningiomas, olfactory groove meningioma and mucocele patient, subtotal resection of the tumor in the craniopharyngioma patient, and decompression and biopsy of the tumors in all metastasis patients. The main reason for not achieving GTR in our series was the cavernous sinus invasion (23.1%). Due to the paucity of cases of olfactory groove meningiomas, metastasis, craniopharyngioma, mucocele, and Rathke cyst, we could not compare our results with the literature for such pathologies.",

This significant decrease is attributed to the use of vascularized nasoseptal flap in the second half of patients. Our small sample size may be the reason that the other complications did not reach statistical significance. However, this is consistent with other studies that have also not shown statistical significance for a decrease in complications.30\n,\n58\n,\n59 One study has even shown an increase in the complication rate, which was hypothesized to be due to increased surgeon confidence and aggressiveness in attempting GTR as surgeons gained experience with the procedure.51 Despite this, the decrease in complication rate is certainly clinically significant and reduces the burden on surgeons and patients when reintervention is necessary.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Firstly, this is a retrospective study with an extremely heterogeneous patient population in regard to pathologic diagnosis encompassing a variety of pituitary adenomas, tuberculum sellae and olfactory groove meningiomas, metastasis, craniopharyngioma, Rathke cyst, and a mucocele. The patient population was small with 56 cases, with each of surgeons A, B, C, and D completing 10, 21, 12, and 13 operations, respectively. All of these challenges were overcome. We think that there is a better outcome in terms of patient care when there is interspecialty teamwork among neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, endocrinologists, ophthalmologist/optometrist, and neurointerventionist. One challenge in regards to initiating the EES, especially in a community hospital setting where EES is relatively new, is that neurosurgeons do not have an abundance of previous experience with endoscopic nasal anatomy. Therefore if there were any intraoperative complications regarding nasal anatomy, an otolaryngologist would be called into the operating room without any prior notice. This was going to lead to increased levels of frustration, especially between neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists. The obvious solution was to increase teamwork and collaboration between the specialties. In this regard, 2 neurosurgeons and 2 otolaryngologists attended several cadaveric courses to learn this new technique together. Only 2 of the local otolaryngologists agreed to participate in the EES operations. This presented another challenge. If any of the postoperative patients presented to the emergency department after discharge, none of the uninvolved otolaryngologists would consider seeing these patients. The otolaryngologists had to better intercommunicate so that they were all comfortable seeing patients post EES presenting with purely nasal problems such as epistaxis. The neuronavigation billing code for remuneration also needed to be alternated between the neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists to better develop the working relationship between the specialties. Other challenges that arose included administrative issues, such as a lack of funding for and a shortage of nasal instrument sets; the logistics of arranging an otolaryngologist and neurosurgeon to be available at the same time; and education of the neurosurgical operating room nursing staff in regards to otolaryngologic procedures. We overcame all these challenges.",

We hope that new trainees will be trained and confident in performing these surgeries in community hospitals.",

However, complex cases (e.g., anterior cranial fossa lesions and craniopharyngiomas) should be referred to an experienced surgeon, such as a well-trained endoscopic skull base surgeon in the same center or in an academic center. The learning curve for EES is steep and improves greatly and quickly with adequate practice. So, endoscopic endonasal resection of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions is safe, minimally invasive, and efficient in a community hospital setting, provided the presence of a multidisciplinary team such as neurointervention and neuroendocrinology. Extent of resection, visual, and postoperative outcomes after gaining experience are similar to those reported in larger academic centers. In the future, as time will allow for the progression of endoscopy instruments and increased surgeon experience, this approach should become first line for the treatment of sellar and suprasellar lesions in hospitals of all settings (academic centers, community hospitals, and developing country hospitals).",
