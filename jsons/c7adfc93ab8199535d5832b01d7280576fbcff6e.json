Such benefits can stem from improved access to capital by firms, better allocation of capital to investment projects, greater risk management, and enhanced portfolio diversification and liquidity for individual investors. While existing economic research shows the development of financial services is generally important for economic growth, a number of previous studies by Outreville (1990) and Ward and Zurbruegg (2000) provide empirical evidence that insurance market development in its own right can promote economic development.

Net written life and non-life insurance premiums for 1998-2003 are included in Table 17 .2. This helps to establish a comparative basis to examine insurance market forces within the region, starting below with an analysis of demand. In many of the emerging markets of Asia, data by underwriting class is unfortunately difficult to obtain. Therefore, in Table 17 .3 we only provide a breakdown of non-life underwriting classes for the developed economies of Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore.

            "text": "With the recent growth of the South and East Asian Insurance market, it is no wonder that it is attracting much attention from the global insurance market. Life insurance premiums for South and East Asia reached a phenomenal growth rate of 18.3 percent in 2002 and non-life insurance premiums grew by 13.8 percent in the same period (Swiss Re 2003b). As Figure 17 .1 indicates, patterns of growth within the region's insurance industry suggest that changes in premiums are correlated with GDP growth, and with GDP predicted to grow at a real rate of 5.7 percent per annum between 2003 and 2006, this growth is likely to continue (Swiss Re 2003b) . This link between GDP and demand for insurance can be explained through the S-curve relationship (Enz 2000) , which indicates that as GDP grows, people begin to have sufficient income and assets to warrant insurance protection. This leads to a steep increase in insurance demand greater than the growth in GDP. However, eventually, as more and more people reach a level where they have already attained insurance, growth in premiums stabilizes. This particular level tends to be different depending on the social security system in place within the particular country.

This is not surprising when considering the changing socio-economic structure of the Chinese population. A rising middle class with a greater income to protect has opened a new market for insurers. Assisted by a decline in restrictive regulations, insurers have been able to offer more insurance products to this developing middle class resulting in a higher growth rate in premiums.

The financial volatility experienced within the region's previous decade has meant that people are looking for safer options to invest their savings, and insurance has recently been seen as one way to reduce risk. By capturing a wide customer base, insurance companies have been able to diversify this risk on behalf of the investors within the region. A culture of self-reliance within many of these countries has also fueled the demand for insurance. As faith in the ability of some governments to provide for people in later life fades, people are procuring insurance policies to ensure their well-being. Also, as with much of the world, an ageing population in South and East Asia is driving demand for pension and investment-linked insurance products, either through direct personal investment or through governments searching for ways to fund their pension schemes.",

Initially, the real estate market experienced a downturn that significantly changed the security holdings of banks. Additionally, bad corporate debt insfigated the collapse of many banks within the region (Roubini 2004) . As a result, the currencies within Asia started to plummet and central banks unsuccessfully tried to support their weakened position. As international funds were being funneled out of the region, and assets were declining in value, companies, governments, and the public within the region became more aware of the risks of investing and relying on established financial bodies to provide good credit assessments. For the insurance industry, this has fueled an increase in demand as a currently limited, but growing public awareness of insurance develops.",

Although their prevalence as the primary means of distribution was a result of their ability to capture a dispersed customer base with a physical presence, there are other burgeoning alternative avenues for distribution such as direct marketing, insurance brokers, financial planners, and the topic in question, bancassurance, which is when a bank distributes insurance products.

The motor insurance market is one form of non-life insurance that has not been developed heavily by the South and East Asian bancassurance merchants, as it is less related to the banks' existing products. Varying degrees of regulation in different countries also dictate the use of this form of insurance distribution. Countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong have been using bancassurance for some time and have little or no restrictions as opposed to countries, such as South Korea, where bancassurance is gradually being introduced through the staged relaxation of rules (Asia Insurance Review 2005). Where restrictions do apply, they are quite varied between countries. For example, in Thailand, the restrictions are focused on particular products and licenses. For instance, a bank cannot issue non-life insurance products unless it is under a brokerage license and until recently, an insurance company was not permitted to pay commissions to banks (SCOR 2003) . Alternatively, in China, restrictions focus on the parties of the arrangements, where it is often stipulated that insurers have to deal with each bank branch individually. In South Korea, the introduction of bancassurance has been gradual and restrictions have focused on the types of insurance products permitted to be sold by banking institutions (Asia Insurance Review 2005). Overall, restrictions governing affiliations between banks and insurance companies as well as restrictions on the distribution of insurance products by non-insurers have been relaxed after the introduction of market liberalization, thus contributing to the rise of bancassurance.",

Alternatively, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan provide all three types of insurance as well as other lines such as crop insurance, workers' compensation, and motor vehicle insurance (Swiss Re 2003b). Some governments have even started to provide insurance against terrorism, particularly for the aviation industry.",

However, increases in both consumer and commercial lending have been met with more prudence, to avoid any future investment bubble. The continued confidence of financial intermediaries is an important facet of the recovery from the previous decade's slump. In particular, insurance companies' role in allowing risks to be spread throughout the region (and the world) and their injection of funds back into the region is pivotal. Large and foreign insurers are more conservative in their investment activities focusing on more passive investments such as cash and deposits. Wide ranging regulation of insurance investment is still prevalent, although changes are expected to increase flexibility and allow for higher yield investments (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 1999).",

Over the 1997 Asian financial crisis, equity investments declined and bond investments increased (Swiss Re 2003a). This is not surprising as the volatility of the South and East Asian stock markets increased over the last decade. Thus, insurers are adjusting portfolios because regulators have consequently maintained a stringent policy on investing in equity markets and because many insurers were negatively affected by their higher weighting of equity holdings during the financial crisis. Moreover, despite the fact that the proportion of real estate investments remained relatively stable, there was an overall decrease in the value of insurers' investments. Consequently, solvency concerns have come to light as regulators are now looking at insurers' balance sheets with more scrutiny. Losses incurred on local investment assets have meant that reshuffling of investments has had to take place to secure appropriate reserves, particularly within Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea.",

Due to the long-term nature of life insurance, companies within this sector experienced a greater mismatch between assets and liabilities. In Indonesia, problems arose because too few investments were denominated in U.S. dollars to offset the policies that were based in the same currency. This currency risk, which was a by-product of insurers trying to gain fi^om higher returns on domestic investment, proved to be quite detrimental once the financial crisis emerged. There was a mismatch in the maturities of assets and liabilities, where longer-term policies were matched with what proved to be shorter-term investments with diminishing value. Perhaps a closer look at what is determining demand and supply within the region will help to alleviate problems such as that experienced in Indonesia.

Moreover, excessive inflation can be linked to macroeconomic instability, with consequences for consumption, investment, and exports. Ward and Zurbruegg (2002) provide evidence that inflation is around 2.5 times more important for insurance demand in Asian economies than it is for developed OECD countries. This emphasizes the role that broad macroeconomic ^' In this discussion, the 'Asian tiger economies' are categorized as consisting of Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. stability plays in the long-term development of the demand for insurance, a role that is mirrored by the accelerated growth of insurance within the relatively stable economies of Singapore, Hong Kong, India, and China. Recent debate on economic development and economic stability has been dominated by discussions of the function played by legal and political institutions. Prominence, however, has usually been given to the effectiveness of legal systems in promoting commercial transactions within an economy. As a contractual exchange of risks, insurance market development is arguably very sensitive to legal and political effectiveness. Ward and Zurbruegg (2002) and Esho, et al. (2004) find clear support for this hypothesis in both the life and non-life sectors. Importantly, a direct positive correlation seems to exist between an improvement in the legal systems within a country and life insurance demand. It is, therefore, highly evident that the effectiveness of the legal environment within an economy is very important for the development of the insurance sector.",

The higher the index the more effective the legal and political system is. In the case of Indonesia where the index was low, weak functioning legal systems are associated with low GDP growth and low insurance market growth.

In particular, national income seems to have a stronger impact on life insurance consumption in Asia, than on the OECD markets. Decision makers should, however, not overvalue these results. Recent research indicates that the effect of national income on insurance demand decreases enormously after controlling for legal and political factors. The empirical resuhs generally suggest that economic stability, conditioned on legal and political stability, appears to be more crucial for long-run success than economic development alone. These findings are also reflected in the impact of income per capita on the demand for life insurance in the Asian 'Tiger' economies. After controlling for legal and political factors, income elasticities tend to be smaller. While economic development may occur at faster rates in Asia, the link to insurance market development does not appear to be as strong.",

However, in contrast to the life insurance industry, existing research highlights that the non-life insurance business is largely unaffected by cultural and institutional factors. In fact, Esho, et al. (2004) state that the development of non-life insurance is 'technically rather than culturally located' indicating the importance of the legal and regulatory environment.",

While many manufacturing industries view South and East Asia as a source of low-cost inputs, global insurance companies view South and East Asia as a potential source of premium growth. The empirical evidence suggests that intra-industry trade in insurance is promoted by a convergence in economic activity across economies. Therefore, an increasing international supply of insurance in South and East Asia will benefit from increased economic growth, and more importantly, salaried employment and rising personal disposable income. All factors which are likely, however, to impede further development of low cost manufacturing and subsequent export growth. It is without a doubt that the South and East Asian economies are now arriving at an important economic crossroad, with pressures to expand into the financial services industry while also trying not to lose their cost-advantages in their already established manufacturing sector. How successfully these economies migrate from manufacturing to service-based economies may have important implications for the medium term economic development of their respective markets, and the consequential desire to purchase insurance.",
