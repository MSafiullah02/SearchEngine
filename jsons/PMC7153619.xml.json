Moreover, viable bacterial strains in the environment can become non-cultivable (viable-but non-cultivable (VBNC)) leading to an underestimation of pathogen numbers or a failure to isolate a pathogen from a contaminated sample. Successively, mass spectrometry has been proposed to increase the speed and sensitivity of culture methods, but these methods have high a cost and require expertise for analyze and interpretation of the data. On the contrary, biochemical immunoassays, such as ELISA, although simple and rapid, can have low sensitivity for the detection of pathogens.",

The biosensor is commonly composed of a biologically active sensitive element (biological element) and an electronic part (sensor or transducer). The operating principles are as follows: \u201cthe biological element\u201d interacts with the substrate to be analyzed and a transduction system; \u201cthe sensor\u201d converts the biochemical response into an electrical signal. This signal digitized into a numeric value, giving the final information. Biosensors can be classified according to the transduction technologies used. In the past decade, different groups of transductions have been introduced; these have led to the formation of three main classes: Optical, mass-based and electrochemical transducers (Figure 2) [12]. The front part of the biosensor, the probes, plays a major role in the identification and detection of the pathogens. These give biosensors the ability to analyze a wide range of complex samples in various fields, including the diagnosis of food pathogens, clinical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. Biosensors have been used and played as a useful tool for the direct detection of the pathogen in the factories during the food processed food. Unlike microbiological and molecular methods, biosensors can detect the pathogen immediately and accurately, and this helps to detect the contamination level and the type of food contamination [6].",

It is important to understand the characteristics of phages, such as the physical and chemical properties, in order to design the biosensor platform able to bind the phage without losing their ability to recognize the bacteria target. Phages can bind to the gold surface trough van der Waals bonding, hydrophobic bonding and covalent bonding between the gold surface and the amine and thiol groups. This strategy is also used in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor using phage as a probe for pathogen detection [17]. Nevertheless, optimal condition of physical absorption has been found for lytic phages able to detect S. aureus by SPR with detection limit ~104 cfu/mL\u22121, or using magnetic elastic sensors [18] capable of detecting Salmonella (detection limit ~103 cfu/mL\u22121) in milk and fat-free [19]. However, physical absorption has several limitations, such as non-specific and weak bonding between phage and sensor surface, leading to desorption during the analytic detection and low surface coverage of deposited phages [17].",

One of the main factors in these methods is the creation of a strong chemical bond between the phages and biosensor surfaces, which leads to the development of a stable capture system. In this case, the purity of the suspension of phages, such as their chemical properties, are important to be aware of before performing any chemical reactions [20]. Gervais et al. developed an oriented immobilization of T4 phages using the commonly recognized streptavidin-biotin reaction. The tail-phage was able to detect E. coli through the expression of biotin in the T4 head, and using the streptavidin-coated gold surface [21]. Moreover, the T4 phage has been used in the functionalization of magnetic nanobeads, and is used to capture and concentrate E. coli from milk by Mortari et al. The successive lysis of the bacteria-binding phage leads to the analysis of endoplasmic material through impedance, with the potential detection limit of 10 CFU/chamber in 30 min [22].",

The phages have an enzyme activity relative to their bacterial host [23]. This kind of enzymatic activity on the biosensor surface causes contradictory signals that contribute to the efficiency of the pathogen diagnosis. Moreover, results recommend that whole phage bound on sensor platforms miss their bacterial binding capacity upon drying [24]. As the phages fall on the biosensor surface after upon drying, it likely makes their tail fibers unable to bind to their bacterial host. In order to overcome these limitations, engineered phages or derived phages have been applied in the development of biosensors devises, as discussed later in this review article.",

            "text": "Reporter Phages - A reporter phage is an engineered phage to produce a signal upon infection of target bacteria. This group of phages detects only live and functional cells because when the phages infect the target bacteria, they activate the cells\u2019 machinery to produce a readily detectable signal, which indicates that the target is both present and viable. This technique is an advanced method of bacteria typing [8]. Phage lambda-based cloning vectors bearing a functional bacterial bioluminescence lux operon was used to improve the reporter phage method. Here, lux operon is expressed in the process of infection by phage in the host cell as part of the phage gene [13]. \u2018\u2018Lux-\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Gfp-\u2019\u2019 expressing phages were successfully used in Salmonella enterica and pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 detection, as well as for detection of Listeria and Mycobacteria [26]. In a study by Zhang et al., the design of a phage that contains luciferase NanoLuc (Nluc), reporter phage, was able to detect E. coli 0157:H7, about 5 CFU/mL, in a food sample by bioluminescence over 9 h [27]. The benefit is that the phage specificity and the strength of the analysis of the phage remove the essential for purification or lengthy sample preparation [28]. Moreover, recently has been shown a proof-of-concept drinking water diagnostic assay for low-cost, rapid and sensitive detection of E. coli using T7 reporter phage. T7 was engineered to express the luceriferase, NanoLuc (NLuc), after the fusion of crystalline cellulose. This novel chimeric reporter allow the detection of <10 CFU mL\u22121\nE. coli in 3 h from 100 mL water sample [29]. However, some structural disadvantages associated with this group of phages also have to be stated. To study the structure of these phages there is a need to have accurate genetic information as their structure is labor-intensive. The capacity of the phage capsid naturally creates limitations for the amount of genetic material that can be presented in the phage genome. General ways to exhibit reporter genes contain recombination, transposition, direct cloning and homologous [8].",

            "text": "The phage display technology must be considered separately. Since, it was first reported in 1985 in Science, phage display technology has evolved as a powerful method for discovery of antigen-specific peptides. A researcher found that bacteriophages can be genetically manipulated through the incorporation of exogenous (poly) peptides into its coat proteins, making a peptides phage library. The filamentous phages, such as fd and M13, are the most commonly used vector to create random peptide display libraries. Filamentous phages appear as a flexible rod-shaped structure, with a total length of 880 nm and a diameter of 6.6 nm. Its circular genome, of 6000\u20138000 bases, is enclosed in a coat composed of up of 2700 copies of major coat protein (pVIII), 3\u20135 copies each of the minor proteins (pIII, pVI and pVII, pIX), on the two ends of the phage particle. In particular, the foreign peptides (length from 6 to 21 amino acids) have been displayed fused to surface exposed N-terminus of all coat proteins. However, the most commonly-used coat proteins for phage display are pIII and pVIII. The phage display libraries consisted of up to 1010 different variants of phage particles with the linear random peptides [30]. This allows ligands to be screened that have a high affinity towards the desired antigen, such as eucariotic cells, bacteria or inorganic material. The phage clones were found to bind, with high affinity, the target, which can be used as a bio-probes in biosensor devises. In this way, for all possible targets, it is possible to find a \u201cphage-clone\u201d able to recognize them. The advantage are robust, stable and resistant to temperature variations and hard pH conditions, such as the wild-type. Moreover, the phage clone presents several copies of peptide of interest, thus increasing the avidity of the specific target binding, compared to the classic wild-type [31]. It has introduced several opportunities in various fields, including vaccine design, targeted drug delivery and antiviral studies [31]. These characteristics make phages an attractive choice as probes for developing biosensors in several fields [32,33].",

            "text": "For the first time in 1990, SPR was used to detect a spectrum of materials [46]. SPR biosensors are optical sensors that use special surface plasmon-polaritons\u2014electromagnetic waves, to monitor the interactions between an analyte in solution and a recognition layer, such as recognize molecules and phages, immobilized on the SPR sensor surface. SPR biosensing, as a spectroscopic technique, enable the quantitative and real-time detection of the binding events without labeling the interacting molecules. The optical system is comprised of an optical surface, a light emitting diode (LED), a glass prism and a photodiode array. The molecular interactions at the surface cause changes in the refractive index, leading to changes in the SPR angle of the reflected light. The photodiode array detects SPR angle changes, and expresses the signals as a response unit (RU). RU is directly proportional to the total mass of the bound ligands. The chips in these sensors usually contains a gold surface functionalized with specific biorecognition elements by chemical bounds [47]. Advanced SPR biosensors have been designed to detect pathogens using a variety of bio-probes in diagnosis of pathogens such as antibodies [48,49], bacteriophages [50] and lectins [51]. Bacteriophages are designed as diagnostic probes for specific detection of pathogens at the SPR level. For example, Singh et al. used immobilized engineered tail spike proteins derived from the P22 bacteriophage onto gold surfaces using thiol-chemistry, in order to selective real-time analytical detection of Salmonella with the sensitivity of 103 CFU/mL\u22121 [24]. This technique successfully detects E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [52], S. aureus, E. coli K12 [13] and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [53]. Full-length recombinant Det7 phage tail proteins (Det7T) are recently used in novel SPR devise for detection of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Det7T is covalently immobilized on gold-coated surfaces by amine-coupling, and can specifically bind to S. typhimurium. Rapid detection (~20 min) of 5 \u00d7 104\u22125 CFU/mL S. typhimurium in water and 10% apple juice was observed by this biosensor [54]. In Table 2 several microorganisms that have been detected using this technique are summarized. The Plasmon waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy, as a relatively new biophysical method, has the structures, which can couple high sensitivity of the SPR sensors and the small resonance width of the dielectric WG sensors. The PWR consists a glass substrate, a thin metallic layer, and a dielectric layer on the top of the metallic layer. The metallic layer plays a very important role in exciting the dielectric waveguide modes (transverse magnetic (TM), and transverse electric (TE). As an example, optical metal clad leaky waveguide (MCLW) sensor can detect Bacillus subtilis var. niger using index changes, scattering and fluorescence from bacterial spores bond to immobilized antibody [55].",

In this case, a bio-receptor is usually an enzyme, such as glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) [71]. In general, this technology includes a thin plate of gold or platinum or carbon. The main advantage of these biosensors is that they are simple and easy to use, and at the same time, highly sensitive. The limitation of this method is low specificity due to interference with active inhibitors, and then the signal inaccuracies. In this method, a quantification of coliform E. coli K-12 with intermediary phages and intracellular release of bacterial enzymes, such as D-galactosidase and carbon oxides can be investigated [72]. This sensor detected 1 CFU/100 mL of bacteria from the sample, but need to pre-incubation phase. Neufeld et al. combined the phage typing technique with amperometric for the specific detection of Mycobacterium smegmatis, E. coli K12, and Bacillus cereus [72]. The basis of these sensors is that through phage infection, it causes bacterial leakage and the spread of intracellular bacterial content, including the enzyme. Enzymatic activity is measurable in a specific substrate. The recent advanced reports, nanoparticle transducers were used to reduce the limitation of electrochemical biosensors. The Gold nanoparticle is one of the most common nanoparticles used in MRI, biosensors and targeting drug delivery for treating brain diseases, significantly increased electrodes sensitivity to the detection of pathogens. Xu et al. designed micro-gold electrodes with phage T4 for the detection of E. coli. The sensitivity of this biosensor is in the range of 1.9 \u00d7 101\u20131.9 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL bacteria [17].

            "text": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique in detecting the electrochemical system. Functional sinusoidal in the system measures the changes in the electrical impedance in the medium. The analysis is carried out based on changes in capacitance, conductance, and impedance. The capacity is often reduced due to the process of microbial metabolism and impedance decreases [79]. Here, bacteriophages are used as diagnostic probes to detect pathogens at the electrode surface. In a study, the impedance was reduced as bacterial concentration enhanced, which is contrary to normal attachment of entire cells on EIS, a promising electrochemical biosensor. Bacteria can be detected by capturing electrons on the electrode surface. In EIS electrochemical sensors with bacteriophage, as a probe, are used to detect bacteria, trough catching the bacteria target the immobilized phages on electrodes, functional groups [17,80]. The main cause of this is the activity of lytic phages on bacteria, which causes the intracellular content to drop out and decrease the conductivity. E. coli was easily detected in pure culture media or inoculated samples in a range between 104\u2013107 CFU mL\u22121 using this method [81]. Webster et al. extend an impedimetric microelectrode array biosensor bacteriophage-based for the detection of bacteria. The results have shown that decreased the width and gap of an electrode and using the working solution with lower relative dielectric permittivity can enhance the sensitivity of impedimetric biosensors for pathogenic bacteria [82]. Graphene is wonder materials with superior properties and using graphene a screen-printed graphene electrode (SPE) for the detection of S. arlettae. Specific lytic phage against S. arlettae was immobilized on the sensor surface for quantitative analysis of the bacterial cells and capturing bacteria using EIS biosensor. Accordingly, the increase in the concentration of bacteria (2\u20132 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL) leads to an increased quantity of charge transfer resistance (Rct). The limit of detection was defined as around 2 CFU/mL [83].",
