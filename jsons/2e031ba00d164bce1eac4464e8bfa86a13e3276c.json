Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myopathy (acquired before icU admission) account for the majority of chronic underlying neuromuscular disorders that are most commonly observed in the icU.",

            "text": "various neuromuscular diseases can impair the different functional components of the respiratory system. some diseases may affect the cortical center of breathing, whereas others predominantly affect the pump function of the respiratory muscles and chest wall to drive air in and out of the lungs. in addition, upper airway muscle weakness can lead to swallowing difficulty and recurrent aspiration that results in hypoxemia and aspiration pneumonia. The end result of the pathophysiological impairments caused by neuromuscular weakness on the respiratory system is respiratory failure (Fig. 29-1) . The most typical changes in the respiratory system observed in patients with moderately advanced chronic neuromuscular dysfunction are listed in Control of Breathing chronic respiratory insufficiency in patients with chronic neuromuscular disorder is primarily due to respiratory muscle weakness. However, several studies have shown that some patients afflicted with congenital myopathies exhibit hypoventilation out of proportion to the severity of their respiratory muscle weakness, suggesting the possibility of impaired central respiratory drive. 1 several studies have shown that the hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses are blunted in patients with congenital myopathies. 2, 3 in normal individuals, the relationship between oxyhemoglobin desaturation and ventilation is linear; that is, a fall of oxygen saturation by 1% is approximately associated with a 1-l/min increase in minute ventilation. a much steeper linear increase in minute ventilation is seen during hypercarbic challenge. Thus, for every 1 mmHg rise in pco 2 , ventilation increases by 2.5-3 l/min. This normal predictable increase in minute ventilation in response to hypoxia and hypercapnea may be altered in certain neuromuscular disorders. in addition to a decrease in central neural drive, a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxia and/or hypercapnia may be related to other factors such as respiratory muscle dysfunction and/or abnormal chest wall and lung mechanics.",

These patients can present in the icU with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is often associated with community-acquired pneumonia. since these patients do not have prior respiratory complaints, respiratory muscle weakness is often not suspected until difficulty weaning from the ventilator is encountered. in one study, 27% of patients with moderately advanced neuromuscular disease who had severe reductions in both inspiratory and expiratory muscle function had no prior respiratory complaints. 4 in another report, 50% of patients with severe respiratory muscle weakness due to chronic neuromuscular disease were asymptomatic. 5 it is unclear why respiratory muscle weakness correlates so poorly with patient reported symptoms. it is possible that the presence of significant respiratory muscle weakness is masked by concomitant generalized muscle weakness and a sedentary lifestyle. The severity and the pattern of involvement of the respiratory muscles by the different neuromuscular disorders are not uniform. some diseases cause global respiratory muscle dysfunction, whereas others cause preferential weakness of the inspiratory or expiratory muscles. Moreover, a decrease in both inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength may not correlate with a general assessment of muscle strength. Primary muscle diseases like polymyositis cause more significant impairment of the respiratory muscles compared to the neuropathies.

The sniff test is not useful in the evaluation of bilateral diaphragm paralysis and may result in an apparently false-normal study. a false negative test may result when both hemidiaphragms appear to descend normally during a sniff maneuver, despite profound weakness, due to a sudden relaxation of the abdominal muscles (i.e., passive inspiration). in addition, a positive sniff test should also be interpreted with caution because this can be seen in up to 6% of normal individuals.

The current concept suggests that GBs is a self-limited, reactive autoimmune disease in which an aberrant immune response is directed against bacterial lipopolysaccharides that share similar epitopes with the myelin sheath or schwann cell basement membrane. viral infections associated with GBs include cytomegalovirus, epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and varicellazoster virus. cytomegalovirus is the most frequently identified viral infection; it has been documented to precede GBs in 11-22% of cases. 12 in such cases, serologic testing may reveal positive anti-cMv immunoglobulin M (igM) antibody, high serum antibody titers to GM2 gangliosides or to sulfated glycolipids of peripheral myelin. GBs associated with cMv infections has the predilection to affect female and younger patients, and is commonly associated with facial and bulbar palsies, respiratory failure, and severe sensory loss. Campylobacter jejuni is the most frequent bacterial infection preceding the diagnosis of GBs. in 23-45% of sporadic cases of GBs, recent C. jejuni infections can be documented by serologic testing or bacterial culture. The actual risk of developing GBs following C. jejuni is 1 in 1,000, suggesting that host susceptibility plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GBs. Unlike GBs preceded by cMv infection, C. jejuni associated GBs often presents as pure motor axonal neuropathy, and seldom involves the cranial nerves. However, it can present as Miller-Fischer syndrome characterized by opthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. serum from such patients often contains high titers of antibodies against gangliosides. High serum GQ1b titer is considered pathognomonic of Miller-Fischer syndrome. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is the second most common cause of bacterial infection linked to GBs occurring in approximately 5% of GBs cases. some cases of GBs have been linked to influenza vaccination, recent surgery, trauma, and malignancy (lymphoma).",

The patient was admitted to the neurology service and was immediately started on intravenous immunoglobulin. On admission, his FVC was 2.8 L and his PI max was 110 cmH 2 O. An arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.39, PaCO 2 of 42 mmHg, PaO 2 of 80 mmHg, and a HCO 2 of 24 mEq/dL. He appeared comfortable, and denied shortness of breath.

Blood gas analysis is used to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Hypercapnia is a late sign of ventilatory failure and should not be relied upon as an indication for when to start mechanical ventilation.

However, in patients with rapidly deteriorating clinical symptoms, plasmapheresis may still offer some benefits even if the duration of the disease is greater than 3 weeks. in approximately 10% of patients, relapse of neurologic symptoms may follow plasma exchange treatment due to antibody rebound. in such circumstances, additional plasma exchange treatment or intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is helpful. intravenous immunoglobulin (iviG) (usually given at a dose of 2 g/kg divided over 2-5 days) given within 2 weeks is as effective as plasma exchange therapy. since iviG is easier to administer, it is preferred over plasma exchange unless there are specific contraindications to its use such as low serum immunoglobulin, a presence of uncontrolled hypertension, and a hyperosmolar state. There is no additional benefit conferred by sequential treatment, consisting initially of plasmapheresis followed by iviG, when compared to either treatment alone. 24 corticosteroids alone confer no therapeutic benefit and may slow recovery in GBs; it is not recommended. 25 The combination of iviG and intravenous methylprednisolone may hasten recovery, but there has been no documented beneficial effect on the long-term outcome.",

            "text": "critical illness polyneuromyopathy (ciPnM) is the most common cause of acquired neuromuscular weakness in both surgical and medical icU patients. The incidence of ciPnM depends on the severity of illness, the diagnostic criteria used, and the timing of examination from the onset of the critical illness. in prospective studies, 25-63% of patients who required mechanical ventilation for at least 7 days developed ciPnM. 26, 27 Patients with sepsis and sepsis syndrome have the highest incidence of ciPnM and it approaches 70-100%. 28 axonal polyneuropathy was initially thought to be the main pathologic changes in icU-acquired weakness. However, electromyography (eMG) and muscle biopsy studies showed that acute myopathy coexists with polyneuropathy, and in fact, often exists as separate clinical entity. accordingly, ciPnM is divided into four categories, namely critical illness myopathy, critical illness polyneuropathy, neuromuscular junction abnormalities, and combined polyneuromyopathy 29 (Table 29-10 ). in a prospective study of 30 patients with critical illness polyneuropathy, biopsy of the quadriceps femoral muscle showed neuropathic changes in 37%, myopathy in 40%, and both neuropathic and myopathic changes in 23% of patients. 30 Muscle necrosis was also present in 30% of the muscle biopsies specimen. several risk factors commonly encountered in the icU setting have been identified in the development of ciPnM. These include severe systemic inflammation especially due to sepsis, sepsis syndrome, multisystem organ failure, use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality, immobility, use of aminoglycosides, and duration of mechanical ventilation. indices that measure the severity of critical illness, such as the acute Physiology, age, and chronic Health evaluation (aPacHe) iii, or the sequential organ Failure assessment score (soFa), are also important predictors of the occurrence of ciPnM. 31 The detrimental effect of hyperglycemia on neuromuscular function is supported by a recent study showing that intensive insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia (blood glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/dl) decreases the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy by 44% compared to conventional insulin therapy (blood glucose level between 180 and 200 mg/dl). [32] [33] [34] [35] in addition, the cases of ciPnM in the intensive insulin treatment group resolved faster. The risk of ciPnM was linearly correlated with the mean blood glucose level. in multivariate analysis, independent predictors of polyneuropathy include conventional insulin treatment (odds ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.6-4.2), vasopressor support of more than 3 days (odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 1.4-4.2), bacteremia (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.1), and dialysis (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.8). similarly, intensive insulin therapy decreased the incidence of ciPnM in patients who required mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days in the medical icU compared to conventional treatment with an absolute risk reduction of -11.6%. Moreover, the cumulative risk of ciPnM over time was also significantly reduced compared to conventionally treated patients, partially explaining the decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation. 36 The pathogenesis of ciPnM is not well understood. since the systemic inflammatory response and multisystem organ failure almost always precedes ciPnM, an exaggerated immune response to injury is thought to be the main pathogenic pathway leading to nerve and muscle injury. The resulting unmitigated systemic and local inflammatory response, in Sepsis and sepsis syndrome is an important risk factor of critical illness polyneuropathy.",

This causes increased microvascular permeability and endoneural edema that decreases blood flow to the nerve and muscle tissue. The end result of this inflammatory cascade is primary axonal degeneration of the sensory and motor fibers and muscle atrophy with loss of contractile proteins and membrane inexcitability. an animal model of sepsis showed that sepsis triggers enhanced muscle protein proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteosome and calpain system causing myofibillar degradation and disruption of the sarcomere. recent studies suggest that critical illness myopathy is not only due to selective myosin loss, but also due to muscle fiber membrane electrical inexcitability caused by defective sodium channel regulation. 37 animal models of critical illness myopathy reveal altered membrane expression and function of the sodium channels. 38 The syndrome is often initially suspected because of distal symmetrical muscle weakness seen after 5-7 days of mechanical ventilation in awake patients, or in those patients who are difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation. These patients usually have no prior history of neuropathy or myopathy. The muscle weakness is most prominent in the lower extremities and is accompanied by muscle wasting and reduced or absent tendon reflexes. Facial muscle weakness, presence of asymmetrical weakness of the limb, or pyramidal signs should prompt further workup to rule out other neurologic causes of weakness. assessment of peripheral muscle strength can be difficult because of sedation, delirium, or the presence of metabolic encephalopathy. nevertheless, if motor strength assessment is possible, a standardized muscle examination can be used to assess the degree of weakness in individual muscle groups. The Medical research council (Mrc) scale for muscle examination includes strength assessment of three different muscle groups on each limb and ranks them on a scale from 0 to 5 as seen in Table 29 -11. 23 The Mrc score is easy to use, and reproducible even in mechanical ventilated patients. Three muscle functions are evaluated in the upper and lower limbs. each function score ranges from 0, which denotes no detectable movement, to 5 denoting normal power. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. a score of less than 48 reflects significant weakness.",

Thymomas are associated with a more fulminate course of MG and are present in one third of patients who experienced myasthenic crises. acute respiratory failure has been reported as the initial presentation of MG. 45 The most common causes of myasthenic crises are respiratory infections (including aspiration) and surgery. other precipitating factors include discontinuation or decreased dosage of anticholinergic or immune modulating medications, or the administration of new medications that precipitate MG. commonly used medications such as corticosteroids, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones class of antibiotics, neuromuscular blocking agents, and neuropsychiatric drugs may precipitate myasthenic crises and should be avoided if possible. The initiation of corticosteroid therapy can paradoxically cause a transient increase in muscle weakness during the first or second week of therapy, especially in patients with severe bulbar symptoms and generalized myasthenia gravis. cholinergic crisis due to excessive dosing of an anticholinesterase medication can mimic myasthenic crisis; this is thought to be due to a depolarization blockade at the neuromuscular junction. other clinical signs of cholinergic crisis that are not present in myasthenic exacerbations include the presence of muscarinic symptoms such as miosis, hypersalivation, increased bronchial secretions, bradycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), sweating, and muscle fasciculation. The Tensilon test has been used routinely in the past to differentiate myasthenic from cholinergic crises. However, this practice is currently not recommended because of the potential for respiratory arrest due to cholinergic weakness and increased secretions and mucus plugging, especially in patients with renal insufficiency.

The dosing schedule of anticholinesterase medications will affect the measurement of these respiratory parameters. The maximum improvement in respiratory muscle strength occurs about 2 h after the drug is given and slowly declines until the next dose is given. consequently, Fvc, Pi max , and Pe max should be measured 30 min before the next dose of anticholinesterase agents.

Myopathy induced by glucocorticoids is largely due to their direct catabolic effects via gluconeogenesis and interference with the insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, which leads to increased myocyte apotosis. steroid myopathy usually presents subacutely as proximal limb weakness, although high-dose corticosteroid therapy can induce clinically important weakness within 2 weeks of therapy. High-dose glucocorticoids given in conjunction with neuromuscular blocking agents may lead to critical illness myopathy as previously discussed (see chap. 58). Myopathy can occur with any glucocorticosteroid preparation, but is unusual in patients treated with less than 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. Muscle enzymes are usually normal. eMG is either normal or reveals slight myopathic changes. in contrast to critical illness myopathy, a steroid-induced myopathy biopsy usually shows loss of type iia muscle fibers with no evidence of inflammation or fiber necrosis. There is poor correlation between the total dose of steroids administered and the severity of muscle weakness. However, a gradual improvement in muscle strength follows discontinuation or reduction of administered corticosteroids.",

The benefits and limitations of both forms of noninvasive mechanical ventilation are listed in Table 29-14. negative pressure ventilation, the iron lung in particular, was the first widely used method of mechanical ventilatory support in the management of respiratory failure due to neuromuscular diseases. during the poliomyelitis epidemics in the 1930s, negative pressure was highly effective in augmenting alveolar ventilation and decreasing the mortality due to poliomyelitis. The early success of nv in the treatment of acute respiratory failure due to poliomyelitis has since been repeated in patients with chronic respiratory failure from other forms of neuromuscular and chest wall diseases.",

For example, synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (siMv) combined with pressure support is useful in patients with nocturnal hypoventilation who have a decreased spontaneous respiratory rate as may occur during sleep. some features that are available on standard ventilators that are useful in the acute clinical setting are the ability to monitor respiratory pattern and to supply variable amounts of enriched oxygen. in patients with acute or chronic respiratory failure who are otherwise hemodynamically stable, small pressure-limited, flowor time-cycled portable ventilators (bilevel positive airway pressure) have been used with success. These devices are particularly useful in partial chronic ventilator support in patients with progressive neuromuscular dysfunction once the acute illness that requires icU care has resolved. The initial tidal volume or inspiratory setting of the ventilator should start at a low setting and ramp up gently, usually every 3-5 min based on patient tolerance, to achieve an increase in assisted tidal volume of 30-50% above baseline or a decrease of 5-10 mmHg in Paco 2 . The expiratory airway pressure on BiPaP is usually set at 4 cm to ensure continuous flow of gas during expiration, thereby flushing out the expired gas. if supplemental oxygen is required, oxygen tubing is connected to the ventilator tubing using a T-connector. The expiratory airway pressure may also be titrated up to increase Frc and improve gas exchange. The initial duration of ventilatory assistance depends on the severity of respiratory failure and patient tolerance. in an acute setting, ventilatory assistance of 20 h/day may be needed. in a chronic setting, we allow the patient to use nPPv during the daytime for a few hours, followed by nocturnal use of 6-8 h once they are accustomed to nPPv.",

The prognosis of patients with neuromuscular dysfunction who require icU admission depends on the type and clinical stage of the neuromuscular disease, the nature of the precipitating illness, and the therapeutic response of the patient to medical interventions. in many cases of neuromuscular disorder, therapy is primarily supportive; avoidance of complications arising from the chronic illness is also crucial to patient recovery.

The answer is e. serial measurement of Fvc is a useful test to detect impending acute respiratory failure. early intubation should be strongly considered once the Fvc is < 12 ml/kg. other signs of impending respiratory failure include severe bulbar symptoms, inability to hold the head up, hypoxemia, and inability to handle oral secretions. The presence of anti-GQ1b and demyelinating form of GBs have also been reported as predictors of acute respiratory failure.2. The answer is c. except for some form of congenital myopathies, central respiratory is usually normal or slightly elevated in patients with neuromuscular disease. There is a linear increase in minute ventilation with every 1% decrease in oxyhemoglobin or 1 mmHg increase in Paco 2 . The linear relationship between hypercapnia and minute ventilation can be used to assess central respiratory drive. However, significant respiratory muscle weakness makes the ANSWERS 569 C HAPTER 29 \u2022 N EU ROMYOPATH I ES I N TH E C R ITICALLY I LL REFERENCES test inaccurate. P 100 , by measuring the pressure generated very early during the inspiratory effort, is a more accurate test of the central respiratory drive since it is unaffected by the degree of respiratory muscle weakness.3. The answer is d. aminoglycosides may potentiate muscle weakness in susceptible patients with neuromuscular disorders. acquired weakness in the icU is most commonly the result of acute myopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy. risk factors commonly associated with these conditions are sepsis, multisystem organ failure, shock, and prolonged use of neuromuscular blocking agents, especially in the presence of renal and hepatic failure. 4. The answer is e. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice in patients experiencing myasthenic crisis. iviG can be used in lieu of plasmapheresis in patients who have hemodynamic instability or difficulty with central venous access. it is prudent to discontinue the anticholinergic agent during myasthenic crisis because of the possibility of concomitant cholinergic crisis. corticosteroids can cause paradoxical weakness 5-7 days after starting corticosteroid treatment and should be withheld until clinical improvement is documented following plasmapheresis. nPPv decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and decrease the duration of icU and hospitalization. 5. The answer is e. all have been identified as risk factors in icUacquired weakness. approximately 70 to as high as 100% of patients with sepsis develop varying degrees of critical illness polyneuropathy. Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation; the need for vasopressor support for more than 3 days. aggressive control of stress-induced hyperglycemia with intravenous insulin therapy has been done to decrease the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy.570 F.C.
