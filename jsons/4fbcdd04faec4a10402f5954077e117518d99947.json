Appropriate empiric therapy is likely to be suboptimal without narrowing diagnostic possibilities to the most likely possibilities pending definitive pathogen identification. Adults ill enough to be hospitalized with a viral ILI may be caused by any one of several respiratory viruses, e.g., hMPV, rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (R/E), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses (COR), adenoviruses (AdV), or human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV). 7e11 In hospitalized adults, some viral ILIs may mimic influenza. Alternately, some ILIs may mimic LD, e.g., adenovirus, HPIV-3. 1,7e10, 15 Viral PCR of respiratory secretions has provided a rapid and definitive diagnosis of the viral etiology of ILIs in hospitalized adults. However, PCR is expensive and not available/utilized at all institutions. 7e13 In such situations, clinicians are faced with the diagnostic dilemma of differentiating influenza and ILIs influenza from adenovirus and LD. 15 Adults hospitalized with LD usually have high fevers (>102 F) with relative bradycardia. Extrapulmonary clinical features with LD include headache, mental confusion, watery diarrhea (AE abdominal pain). Leukocytosis is the rule as is relative lymphopenia. Non-specific laboratory tests common in LD include hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, mild/elevations of serum transaminases, highly elevated serum ferritin levels (>2 \u00c2 n), elevated CPK levels, or microscopic hematuria. 16e18 Diagnostic specificity of non-specific findings is increased when combined. 19, 20 ILIs are so named because they have clinical features in common with influenza. Influenza A findings are strain dependent, i.e., during the swine influenza A (H 1 N 1 ) pandemic, a normal WBC count or leukopenia was the rule. Whereas in the last influenza A (H 3 N 2 ) epidemic, leukocytosis was the rule. Both H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 influenza A pneumonia are accompanied by relative lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Some influenza patients have mild transient elevations of serum transaminases. Findings that argue strongly against a diagnosis of influenza include relative bradycardia, a highly elevated ESR (>90 mm/h) or a highly elevated serum ferritin (>2 \u00c2 normal) level. 16, 20 In our case of hMPV pneumonia there some were features that suggested influenza A, e.g., thrombocytopenia. However, relative bradycardia suggested LD (Table 1) . 16, 19, 20 The presence of hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and mildly elevated serum transaminases also mimicked LD. Our hMPV patient had a CXR with focal patchy infiltrates unusual for a viral CAP but usual for LD. Arguing against the diagnosis of LD, was the presence of thrombocytopenia and lymphocytosis rather than relative lymphopenia and a normal platelet count (Table 2) .
