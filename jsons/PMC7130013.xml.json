To be more precise, about 1012 human cells for every 1013 bacteria, as an adaptive advantage of the replication of bacteria that occurs every 20\u201340 min, as against tens of years in the human species.",

Only thus can we minimise the risks of exposure, ensure early detection and timely diagnosis, and adopt the most effective infection control, therapeutic and preventive measures. We must never lose the humility to learn from mistakes and bear in mind the fundamental role of social communication in safeguarding a transparent and coherent risk assessment and management strategy. In other words, we must learn how to evolve in the wake of these new Coronaviruses, the nCoVs, to make a sustained and responsible change in our behaviour and attitudes.
