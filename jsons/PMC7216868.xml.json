Upon the arrival of the first infected subject, the model evolves as follows: among the susceptible people, some become infected (passing from group S to group I) and, over time, some infected patients die while others heal (passing from group I to group R). In our model, moreover, we take into account the fact that, after a certain period of transitory immunity, the healed ones go back to being susceptible (that is, passing from group R to group S).
