In this context, we were interested in analyzing heptapeptide and large sequences characterized by identical amino acid sequence but with a different conformation in proteins of known three-dimensional structure. Identical pentapeptide sequences [1] and hexapeptide sequences [2], [3] are known to adopt different conformations in protein tertiary structures. A synthetic protein comprising 11-residue segment that formed alpha-helix in one context and a beta-sheet in another stabilized by non-local interactions was successfully designed and dubbed as \u2018chameleon\u2019 sequence [4]. Later, a challenge by leaders in protein folding [5] prompted [6] to convert a much larger, i.e., 56-residue protein domain to a different fold by changing no more than half the number of residues. Subsequently, three instances of identical heptapeptide sequences (then known to be the longest) in naturally occurring proteins were observed in both helix and sheet conformation along with thirty-six newly identified hexapeptide sequences [7]. In later studies [8], four identical octapeptide sequences and eight new heptapeptide chameleon sequences were identified. In a recent study comprising 6962 proteins, 2 octapeptides and 52 heptapeptides of helix in strand (HS) conformation and 7 heptapeptides and 37 hexapeptides of helix in sheet (HE) conformation were reported [9]. Another study on \u2018redundant\u2019 sets of experimental models of protein structures, showed the presence of \u201cdual-personality\u201d (DP) fragments that differentiate between regular fold and intrinsically disordered fragments [10].",

For instance, chameleon sequences have been suggested to play a role in the structural fold conservation and functional diversity of alternative splicing protein isoforms [9]. Chameleon sequences have been implicated in the context of theories on immune recognition [11], or in the induction of amyloid-related fatal diseases [12]. Chameleon sequences are known to inherently possess the property of \u201cconformational contagion\u201d, i.e., to take on alpha-helix or beta-sheet conformation depending on the sequentially neighboring secondary structure if little other non-local interaction occurs [13]. In the case of \u2018redundant\u2019 proteins, the \u201cdual-personality\u201d fragments are often targets of regulation [10].",

The present analysis included the search for chameleon sequences that represent the coil conformation as \u2018probe\u2019.

Only high resolution crystal structures, i.e., refined at \u22642.5 \u00c5 resolution was used for the analyses. The amino acid sequences corresponding to helices and strands in these proteins were defined according to the PROMOTIF program [15] and were readily available from PDBsum [16]\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/. These were retrieved using a Python script. The PROMOTIF program identifies helices and strands using a slightly modified method described in the DSSP program [17], in order to include one extra residue at the end of each strand and helix where possible (according to the IUPAC convention rule 6.3 that is most commonly used among crystallographers). The heptapeptide and large sequences corresponding to the coils in protein structure were later extracted. Three files were prepared corresponding to heptapeptide and large sequences; one for helices, the second for strands and the third for coils. From these three files, another equivalent set of files were prepared that corresponded only to the representative (or non-redundant) helix, strand and coil sequences. These were selected based on identical peptide sequence length and amino acid sequence. These representative sequences were used for identifying chameleon sequences in the PDB.",

We observed \u223c548 heptapeptide and large chameleon sequences from our analysis of the type where an entire helix, strand or coil conformation, in one protein is observed with a different conformation in another protein. However, by selecting non-redundant chameleon peptides from protein crystal structure data with resolution \u22642.5 \u00c5 and B-factor for chameleon peptide atoms \u226440.0, we observed only ten chameleon peptides in different proteins as shown in Fig. 1(A) (supplementary data). Our analysis suggests that the largest chameleon peptide observed in the PDB in this manner is restricted to a maximum of seven amino acid residues. The chameleon peptide type, PDB code/chain, location in the protein chain, chameleon peptide sequence, peptide length, protein superfamily (or protein name) and the crystal structure resolution are indicated. These proteins cannot be structurally superimposed and often belong to different species. Majority of these chameleon peptides represent an entire strand in one protein that corresponds to subsequence of a larger helix sequence in another protein. Two examples of heptapeptide chameleons associated with the coil conformation were also observed. For instance, the heptapeptide chameleon sequence; TPIVTLY in coil conformation in the lyase protein (PDB_code: 2ZSJ/A) corresponds to a strand in the hydrolase protein (PDB_code: 2E9L/A).",

The chameleon decapeptide; SGINASVVNI, in the L-chain (PDB code: 1ZV8) is in coil conformation and in the A-chain (PDB code: 1ZV7), the peptide represents subsequence of helix sequence. Entry of the SARS coronavirus into its target cell requires large-scale structural transitions in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein in order to induce fusion of the virus and cell membranes [22]. This suggests that chameleon peptides and their associated conformations observed in structurally similar proteins may be important for the corresponding protein function. The different protein environments, such as interaction with solvent or ligand or both contribute to identical peptides with different conformations in structurally similar proteins.",

This \u201cconformation contagion\u201d property of chameleon sequence has been proposed as a new nonlocal determinant factor in protein structure and misfolding related to protein conformational diseases [13]. From Fig. 1(A), we see that certain sequences in the helix conformation (\u2018VCSTYLT\u2019 in PDB code: 1B2R/A) constitute the latter half of the strand conformation as in (PDB code: 2HJR/A-chain). Likewise, a strand sequence (\u2018VQAVVSR\u2019 in PDB code: 2O2G/A) is observed as latter half of helix conformations as in (PDB code: 1QNO/A). These may be due to a chameleon sequence taking on a satellite state through contagion by the power of a secondary structure as proposed by the \u201cconformational contagion\u201d hypothesis [13]. In the same context, what would happen to a chameleon sequence that adopts a coil conformation in protein structure when fused at the end of a helix or beta-strand that has little interaction with rest of the protein remains to be understood.",

These types of chameleon peptides are different from those hitherto reported in the literature. We did not, however, identify situations where a whole strand sequence was observed as a whole helix sequence, or a whole helix sequence as whole coil, and so on, corresponding to the heptapeptide and large sequences in protein structures. Most importantly, our analysis suggests that there are far fewer heptapeptide and large chameleon sequences in the PDB, when strict quality criterion are applied for the selection of crystal structures that include the B-factor corresponding to the chameleon peptide atoms; these criterion may be important for possibly recognizing the \u201ctrue chameleons\u201d in the PDB.
