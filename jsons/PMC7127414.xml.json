The mechanically ventilated patient must have a period of stability followed by deterioration and increased support (VAC), a suspected infectious cause (IVAC), and finally meet the confirmatory criteria for either possible-VAP or probable-VAP. Each tier has specific and clearly defined, objective criteria that must be met to qualify for the next level. This system is substantially different from the previous NHSN definition of VAP (PNU1), which was more subjective with many of the parameters not clearly stipulated. The PNU1 diagnosis was made when a patient met radiographic, systemic, and pulmonary function criteria. The guidelines were less precise allowing significant leeway in the interpretation, which led to high degree of variability between providers in defining when a patient had pneumonia. One ramification of the interobserver variability was that it limited the ability to compare reporting within institutions and across hospital systems. To highlight how the new diagnosis of VAP differs, we next review the three categories comprising the diagnosis of PNU1 (Box 1\n).Box 1NHSN PNU1 definition\nRadiologic criteria (\u22652 serial radiographs with at least one of the following)1.New or progressive infiltrate2.Consolidation3.Cavitation\nSystemic criteria (at least one of the following)1.Fever (>38\u00b0C or >100.4\u00b0F)2.Leukopenia (<4000 white blood cell/mm3) or leukocytosis (\u226512,000 white blood cell/mm3)3.For adults \u226570 years old, altered mental status with no other recognized cause\nPulmonary criteria (at least two of the following)1.New onset of purulent sputum, or change in character of sputum, or increased respiratory secretions, or increased suctioning requirements2.Worsening gas exchange (eg, desaturations, increased requirements, or increased ventilator demands)3.New-onset or worsening cough, or dyspnea, or tachypnea4.Rails or bronchial breath sounds\n",

Although radiographic evaluation may be helpful in identifying causes for worsening pulmonary function, a finding on plain chest radiograph may easily be interpreted as an infiltrate, atelectasis, effusion, or pneumonia between providers and frequently may not manifest until well after a patient with pulmonary dysfunction has clinically improved. Radiographic studies are an adjunct to the diagnosis of pneumonia but are not required and have been eliminated from VAE surveillance criteria.",

These criteria are similar to the standards that determine when a patient has an IVAC, except there is not a stipulation regarding hypothermia, temperature less than 36\u00b0C in the PNU1 definition.

New onset of purulent sputum, change in the character of the sputum, or need for more frequent suctioning were considered one element but there were no specific cutoffs leaving the evaluation of purulent, character, or frequency purely subjective. The new VAP definition has defined qualitative and quantitative values of neutrophil count and colony-forming units that must be met to establish possible-VAP and probable-VAP. The second of the four pulmonary criteria vaguely defined worsening gas exchange. However, these criteria were described as desaturations, increased oxygen requirements, or increased ventilator demand but did not define the increment or duration of time. In comparison the diagnosis of VAP is contingent on the patient having met the criteria of a VAC. The VAC criteria clearly establish minimum increases in Fio\n2 and/or PEEP and stipulate the duration of time relative to a previous period of stability and to the diagnosis of VAP. The two remaining pulmonary criteria for PNU1 were comprised of patient symptoms: worsening cough, dyspnea, or tachypnea; and patient examination findings, such as rales or bronchial breath sounds. In contrast, the VAE surveillance definition does not use any symptoms or examination findings as criteria for defining VAP.",

Clinical complications, such as venous thromboembolic event, pulmonary edema, aspiration, and ARDS, can adversely affect the duration of mechanical ventilation; ICU LOS; increase mortality; and further convolute other important aspects of care, such as sedation, prevention of ICU delirium, and early mobility.

One of the first studies to evaluate how the surveillance criteria for VAE could be used to identify patient complications used retrospective data collected from three academic medical centers in different regions of the United States. Each unit submitted 100 patients that were mechanically ventilated 2 to 7 days and 100 patients that ventilated for greater than 7 days. Each patient was independently assessed using the VAC criteria and according to the PNU1 definition. This study demonstrated that patients who met criteria for VAC and PNU1 had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS. VAC diagnosis was associated with increased mortality, whereas PNU1 diagnosis was not, and VAC assessment was considerably less time consuming for the assessors to perform compared with evaluation with the PNU1 criteria.3 Another early study performed in 11 ICUs in Canada and the United States prospectively evaluated 1320 patients using VAC, IVAC, and PNU1 criteria.4 This study demonstrated that patients meeting criteria for VAC and IVAC had increased mortality compared with patients diagnosed with VAP using PNU1. The results also highlight the importance of the subjective surveillance definition, because there was a poor correlation agreement between patients that met the criteria for VAC or IVAC and patients diagnosed with VAP using the PNU1 definition. Similarly, another retrospective study from a tertiary, teaching hospital in Australia evaluated 543 patients intubated greater than or equal to 2 days, using the VAC surveillance criteria, and demonstrated patients with VAC had increased duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS, and duration of antibiotic therapy.5\n",

In this group, 27 patients met criteria for VAC, which means most patients (n = 56) that were diagnosed with clinical pneumonia in this study did not have any evidence of increased oxygen requirements. An even smaller number of patients in this cohort had either qualitative (possible-VAP, n = 18) or quantitative (probable-VAP, n = 4) microbiologic data supporting the VAP diagnosis. Another study by Chang and colleagues10 demonstrated similar results; only one-third of the 165 episodes of clinically diagnosed VAP would have met VAC criteria with even fewer possible-VAP (12.1%) and probable-VAP (1.2%). Although this study demonstrated that patients with VAC had higher mortality than patients with clinical VAP, it is one of the few that demonstrates patients with possible- and probable-VAP have increased hospital mortality compared with the patients with clinical VAP.",

One study prospectively evaluated all patients admitted to an ICU and mechanically ventilated 2 or more days using the VAC surveillance criteria during a 12-month period from 2013 to 2014 in large teaching hospital. They identified 67 VACs in 1209 patients. They substantiated the finding that the mortality in patients with VAC was significantly higher than patients without VAC, and characterized the most common causes of VAC: IVAC (50.7%), ARDS (16.4%), pulmonary edema (14.9%), and atelectasis (9.0%). Probable-VAP and possible-VAP accounted for 44.1% and 17.6% of the IVACs, whereas the remaining cases did not have microbiologic data to delineate the cause. This study also attempted to determine which cases of VAC were preventable. Two investigators reviewed each case and identified cases where medical error contributed to the respiratory complication or whether the VAC was a result of the patient\u2019s underlying disease process. They determined that 25 (37.3%) were potentially preventable events.11 The other study was a large retrospective review of 16 years of data from a French national ICU database (OUTCOMEREA). This study evaluated the data for patients who were intubated a minimum of 5 consecutive days. They identified 3028 patients, 77% of them had VAC and 29% had IVAC. Patients with either possible-VAP or probable-VAP accounted for only 14.5% of VAC events and only 27.6% of the IVAC events. Other significant causes of VAC and IVAC were attributed to other nosocomial infections, failed extubation requiring reintubation, derecruitment during patient transport, and overresuscitation. The authors attribute the high rate of VAC to the study group; patients that require mechanical ventilation a minimum of 5 days are higher risk for adverse events. Both of these studies are important because they begin to characterize the frequent causes of respiratory deterioration in mechanically ventilated patients. By understanding how VACs occur clinicians can identify methods to prevent future events.12\n",

            "text": "Although the NHSN surveillance definition of VAE has been shown to be an effective method of characterizing respiratory deterioration, several areas may require further clarification. The current definition requires a 2-day period of stability with subsequent sustained increases in either PEEP or Fio\n2. This requirement necessarily eliminates any patient with a primary process that adversely affects the pulmonary status at the time of admission to the ICU. Stoeppel and colleagues14 demonstrated a large number of surgery patients (77%) were excluded from meeting VAE criteria, because they never had a period of stability before their respiratory deterioration. In these patients, this deterioration was an evolution of their inciting process. Similarly, several studies have discussed that VAE criteria does not account for airway pressure release ventilation or similar modes that do not use PEEP, which results in underreporting the number of patients that would otherwise have VAE.11, 14, 15 Potential solutions that would accommodate the use of these modes would be to include increasing requirements of mean airway pressure or potentially using changes in the P/ ratio. Although the goal of tracking VAE may be to track and trend preventable causes of respiratory failure; it is important for the surveillance criteria to have the broadest view including modes that directly affect the mean airway pressure so as to capture all events so that even these patterns of care may be analyzed for possible improvement.",

Frequently the clinical pneumonias were characterized using a hybrid of the objective probable-/possible-VAP criteria but allows the inclusion of the subjective radiographic criteria of PNU1. The comparisons have demonstrated that using the objective VAE surveillance criteria to identify pneumonia correlates poorly with the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia. Nearly all of the studies demonstrated that ventilator days, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS correlates more closely with VAC compared with clinical VAP.

Each participating ICU designated a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist to champion the education and data collection. The results of the study were impressive. Initial compliance with SAT and SBT in most centers was low but through the course of the study rates of daily SAT and SBT significantly improved while the rate of VAC and IVAC per episode of mechanical ventilation was significantly decreased. During the study, the duration of mechanical ventilation decreased by 2.4 days, ICU LOS by 3.0 days, and hospital LOS by 6.3 days. There were no changes in the rate of hospital morality or VAP. Not surprisingly, the rate of self-extubations per episode of mechanical ventilation increased but there was no change in the rate of reintubation within 24 hours.

This bundle has been shown to improve patient outcomes by eliminating sedative and narcotic infusions, decreasing delirium, increasing patient participation in SATs and SBTs, and promoting early participation with occupational and physical therapy. All of these efforts, in turn, reduce duration of mechanical ventilation, and translate to decreased incidence of VAE.16 Other efforts that may play a role in reducing VAE include using lung-protective ventilation and preventing overaggressive fluid or blood product resuscitation. Although there have not been any studies to date demonstrating the effects of these strategies on VAE, each has been shown to mitigate lung injury, which may lead to deterioration of pulmonary function in ventilated patients.",

Many of the publications reviewed in this article were performed in mixed populations and so how the criteria apply to surgical patients is unclear. Many surgical patients require mechanical ventilation secondary to another insult or injury and not from a primary pulmonary process as in many of the medicine patients. There is a bimodal distribution of pulmonary dysfunction in surgical patients. Some patients have early progressively worsening respiratory failure as a consequence of their initial injury or process and other patients develop late pulmonary dysfunction as a consequence of pneumonia or aggressive resuscitation secondary to the treatment of their primary event. The VAE criteria do not readily identify the first group because they never have a period of stability, but readily identify the other group. The appropriate resuscitation of a surgical patient with abdominal sepsis or the trauma patient with acute hemorrhage may secondarily exacerbate pulmonary dysfunction. Future studies that investigate VAE in these subsets of patients may help identify new end points for resuscitation that minimize pulmonary dysfunction while providing correction of acidosis and restoration of end-target organ perfusion.",

The VAE criteria stratify respiratory compromise of ventilated patient into a tiered system that includes VAC, iVAC, possible-VAP, and probable-VAP. Each classification has defined objective criteria that eliminate the subjectivity of previous PNU1 definition. The implementation of VAE criteria is intended to better characterize and quantitate the broader causes of respiratory deterioration in ventilated patients, and to shift the focus away from VAP as the only relevant ventilator-associated complication. This new definition eliminates radiographic finding as a component of the definition and, as a result, may underestimate the rate of clinical pneumonia. Instead these categories are intended to also capture all of the other noninfectious causes of respiratory compromise in ventilated patients. These objective criteria facilitate the automated collection of data from the EMR and reduce variability in reporting, which allows for easier comparison of data within institutions, between health care systems, and even across international borders. The current definition has been well studied in medicine patients but has not been well vetted in the surgical population. Additionally, these criteria may need to be amended to account for nonconventional modes of ventilation, such as airway pressure release ventilation. Using the new VAE surveillance definition serves as a quality indicator proxy. Adherence to the best practices standards of daily awakening and breathing trials and initiating early mobilization reduces the duration of ventilator dependence and the subsequent incidence of all classifications of VAE.",
