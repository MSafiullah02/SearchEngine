There are two possible reasons for this; on one hand, LMWH is a glycosaminoglycan 41 that partially inhibits the SARS-related coronavirus strain HSR1. 42 Mycroft-West et al. also showed that LMWH can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein (Spike) S1 Receptor Binding Domain and block the replication of the virus, thus, showing potential antiviral effects. 43 Additionally, LMWH can reduce lymphocyte death caused by the direct viral infection of lymphocytes. 13 On the other hand, preliminary research has confirmed that proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, can induce lymphopenia. 14 Therefore, decreases in the number or activity of relevant inflammatory factors may have some significance for the increase in LYM%.",

At the same time, studies have shown that LMWH is not easily inactivated by Platelet Factor 4(PF4) 24,25 , and has a strong affinity with VWF, which can prevent the interaction between VWF and platelet 26,27 , significantly reduce the release of VWF 28 by platelet and endothelial cells, and reduce platelet aggregation and consumption. In the difference analysis of this study, the mean difference of platelet count in heparin group and control group was 5.57, -52.48(P < 0.05), which was consistent with the results of the above study. Clinical observations have shown that nearly 20% of patients with COVID-19 have coagulopathy, including nearly all severe and critically ill patients. 7,29 Studies have shown that IL-6 and IL-8 can cause hypercoagulation, leading to scattered fibrin clots, shortening the clot dissolution time and maximum dissolution rate, 30 which suggests that the hypercoagulation status of COVID-19 patients may be related to the body increased cytokine levels. In previous studies of patients with COVID-19, D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients admitted to the ICU with severe cases. 31 The research of Ning Tang et al. showed higher levels of d-dimer and FDP in fatal cases, 32 but Li et al. believe that while monitoring for venous thromboembolism, the correlation between D-dimer and COVID-19 severity must be considered. 33 However,there is currently no conclusive evidence supporting the use of D-dimer as an evaluation index. 34.35.36 A large sample analysis is required to determine whether D-dimer is associated with COVID-19 severity.
