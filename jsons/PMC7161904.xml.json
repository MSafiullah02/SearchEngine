Anti\u2010D immunised patients were not taken into consideration because we were unable to discriminate whether anti\u2010D was caused by unmatched transfusions, or (mainly regarding fertile women) was due to recent anti\u2010D administration in the context of a D\u2010positive pregnancy or transfusion. Patients who formed antibodies, yet either lacked exposure to a (documented or assumed) antigen\u2010positive red cell unit or expressed the antigen themselves (i.e. auto\u2010immunised patients) were deemed ineligible. In addition, alloimmunised patients were excluded if their first\u2010time alloantibody positive screen occurred within 7 days of the first mismatched transfusion, as these were more likely to represent boosting of earlier primary immunisations. By consulting the nationwide alloimmunisation registry (http://www.sanquin.nl/producten-diensten/diagnostiek/trix), we additionally excluded patients previously diagnosed with alloimmunisation in other hospitals. Considering the above\u2010mentioned criteria, we specifically aimed to exclude previously alloimmunised patients, including pregnancy\u2010induced immunisations in women. Finally, haemoglobinopathy patients and infants below 6 months of age were not included.",

Consequently, we used the following strategy. First, we identified a subset of covariates to be confounders of a given determinant based on their observed association with the determinant within the source population (i.e. the non\u2010alloimmunised controls). Such an association was defined as a \u22653% difference in covariate presence between controls exposed and controls not exposed to the determinant. Covariates in the causal pathway between the determinant and the outcome were not considered as confounders (Hernan et al, 2002). Second, to be able to accurately control for confounders with low prevalences, we estimated a probability score for each determinant using logistic regression with the potential confounders as predictors (Brookhart et al, 2013). Third, to minimize bias due to missing data on the confounders, we used multiple imputation. Details on the used imputation model can be found in the Data S1 and Table SI. Finally, we evaluated the association between various types of infections and red cell alloimmunisation by subsequently entering the corresponding probability scores into the logistic regression model with alloimmunisation as the outcome and conditioning on the matched variables.",

Missing CRP and leucocyte values were multiply imputed using the same strategy as described above. While the likelihood that an increased inflammatory parameter has been recorded at least once increases with the number of measurements and thus with the duration of hospitalization, we repeated these analyses limited to parameters measured within the week following the implicated transfusion.

Analogous to viral infections, these findings require confirmatory research. Yet, they again corroborate animal experiments showing significantly attenuated alloimmunisation responses upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pretreatment in mice (Hendrickson et al, 2008). LPS, an endotoxin in the outer cell membrane of Gram\u2010negative bacteria, strongly stimulates innate immunity by agonizing TLR4 on macrophages and dendritic cells. Conversely, LPS is also implicated in a transient, possibly self\u2010protective immune paralysis, known as LPS tolerance (Lauw et al, 2000; Weijer et al, 2002; Gould et al, 2004). Restimulation with LPS in this respect initiates blockage of CD4+ T cell functioning via impaired release of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)12 and IL18 from monocytes and dendritic cells, together with a diminished upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class\u2010II and costimulatory molecules (Mattern et al, 1998; Gould et al, 2004). While regulatory T cells selectively express TLRs (including TLR4), their LPS\u2010induced proliferation might also contribute to the observed effects in both mice and humans (Caramalho et al, 2003). Finally, we cannot exclude an indirect role for Gram\u2010negative bacteraemia on red cell alloimmunisation due to their common association with other modulators. Indeed, suppressed mitogenic B and T lymphocyte responses were observed following administration of antibiotics, including cephalosporins, an antibiotic class frequently used in the treatment of Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections (Borowski et al, 1985; Pomorska\u2010Mol et al, 2015).",

Although one could argue that this strategy could possibly dilute some effects, on the other hand, it assures inclusion of most factors of influence at the time of exposure. For example, repeated LPS exposure might induce a state of tolerance persisting for up to 30 days (Cross, 2002). In addition, a recent study showed that poly(I:C) facilitates red cell alloimmunisation for at least 14 days with its maximum effect reached 7 days after administration (Elayeb et al, 2016). As a validation of our chosen risk period length, a sensitivity analysis on infections diagnosed during the week preceding or following the implicated transfusion did not change our conclusions (data not shown). Similarly, only the duration of fever accompanying severe bacterial infections, rather than its timing in the risk period, affected alloimmunisation.

Indeed, a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded the 53 patients in whom alloantibodies were discovered during the second week following their first antigen\u2010incompatible transfusion did not substantially change RRs (data not shown).
