The HCV causing virus is mainly transmitted to humans by transfusion of human body fluids similar to HIV [1]. According to the world health organization (WHO), 3\u20135 lakh death cases among 130\u2013150 million hepatitis C virus infected individuals are being reporting each year across the world [2]. The existence of hepatitis C was suggested in the 1970s and is discovered in 1989 [3]. Hepatitis C infects only humans, chimpanzees according to few studies it is also found the in blood samples of horses in the form of non primate hepacivirus (NPHV) [4]. About 85% viral persistence in the liver of HCV infected individuals is reported. The infection is petite, if the diagnosis become delayed it leads into chronic infection (in 70\u201380% of cases) and development of liver cirrhosis increases the death aspects of the infected individuals (Fig. 1\n).",

The symptoms of HCV is not provoked immediately and thus majority of infected individuals may not be physically ill [2]. HCV infections can be quickly detected through serological assays by confirming the presence of antibodies related to HCV virus. The other virological assays include ELISA, RT-PCR and immunoblot assays can be employed for the respective detection. The vaccine therapy for prototypes of Hepatitis A and B is available and vaccination program to combat Hepatitis C is still under development. Though, the treatment has been progressed rapidly, but morbidity and mortality rates are still predicted to rise, efficacious and tolerable therapies are urgently needed [6]. The standard drug therapy for the treatment of HCV infection is combination of peginterferon (PEG-Inf) and ribavirin, with either boceprevir or telaprevir cured the 65% of HCV positive people [7]. The drug ribavirin is also a best choice for other viral diseases like respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus [8].",

In 2013\u201314, the toll of 17.5% chronic cases among the total diagnosed HCV infections in European Union has stunned the health agencies to initiate preventive strategies and treatment regimen on priority. The prime concerns in the spreading the acute and chronic HCV infections is through the contact of blood products by intravenous mode of Drug Use (IDU), unsafe surgical procedures and untested body fluid transfusion. The others mode includes sharing of injectible syringes, inadequate sterilization of medical equipments and sexual communication (Fig. 2b) [10,11]. According to Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number new acute infections are being increasing the United States from last few years. As per surveillance data from the CDC, the number of estimated acute infections from 1982 to 2016 and number of death cases from 2010 to 2016 has been graphed and presented Fig. 2c and d [12]. The significant number of death cases due chronic HCV infections are raising among the affected individuals is noticed. The mortality rate in Canada from 2003 to 2017 is 27.67% and the chronic situation turns into hepatic carcinoma in 36.66% HCV positive hospitalized individuals [[13], [14], [15]]. Similarly, the adult age to old age (20\u201360yrs) group of the male population are prone to be victims of the HCV infections than females [11]. The antiviral therapy to combat HCV infections is available and the dosage regimen criterion is varied with respect to health agencies. In recent, the difficulties in prescribing direct acting antiviral drugs (DAA) and other instructions has been directed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [16].",

Hepatitis C virus demonstrate seven types of genotypes (G1, G1a, G1b, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6 and mixed or others) in the nature [5]. Among them Genotype-1 is the most common in South America and Europe, 70% of reported cases are caused by genotype-1 in USA only, while, 20% of the population infected by genotype-2 and nearly 1% each of the other genotypes [19]. The open reading frame (ORF) of HCV genome encodes approximately 3000 amino acids; structural proteins located near to N-terminal regions and non-structural polyproteins present on left over part of the ORF. The HCV viral genome is comprised of structural (Core Protein (Capsid), E1, E2 and Frameshift protein) and nonstructural polyproteins (P7, NS2, NS3S, NS4A/NS4B & NS5A/NS5B) (Fig. 3\n). The structural polyproteins are reported to have the functions at viral entry period into the cell. Among them, core protein plays foremost task in formation of nucleocapsid-like particles (NLPs) to interact with vital cellular proteins [20,21]. The envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) are the predominant components of the structural proteins helpful in the viral entry and fusion into the host cell. The E2 glycoprotein networks with critical receptor proteins present on the host surface via charged interactions and is also beneficial in host recognition [22]. The existence of F frameshift protein is reported in chronic infections, role is still imprecise and under exploration.",

The P7 is a tiny integral membrane protein important for linking the \u03b1-helical transmembrane domains and the HCV infectivity depends on the mutations of this protein [30]. The short lived NS2 protein is accountable for associating of virion with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It consists of zinc binding site when unite with NS3 and liable for cleavage [31]. The multifunctional role of NS3-NS4A protein by which it affects the host cell pathways made it as druggable target; it is due to occurrence of serine protease domain at N-terminal and helicase/NTPase domain at C-terminal ends. It also acts as protease to catalyze the NS3/4A, NS4A/4B, NS4B/5A and NS5A/5B intersections [32]. The NS3-4A serine protease complex involves in the cleavage activity and protective role to bypass the innate immunity of the host cell. The above specified activity of NS3 is only commenced when it is associated with NS4A as a co-factor. The NS3 helicase/NTPase has numerous functions such as stimulating RNA, RNA binding, unwinding of RNA and altering protein conformation followed by NTP hydrolysis [31]. The integral membrane protein (NS4B) anchors the transmembrane and replication complexes present on the ER [33]. The N-terminal of metalloprotein NS5A is vital for viral assembly and for interacting with RNA; the C-terminal is critical for development of lipid raft composites which is beneficial for viral replication. It also has several other functions depending on its interaction regimen with various cellular proteins [34]. The NS5B is also termed as tail-anchored membrane protein which has the RNA-dependant-RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, significant for post-translational amendments of \u03b1-helical transmembrane situated in C-terminal. Whereas, the N-terminal of the NS5B (RdRp) has three typical binding sites termed as 'fingers', 'palm' and 'thumb' regions. The HCV viral RNA synthesis is depends on the interactions among subdomain of the thumb and finger region results in altering the catalytic site [35]. Apart from the specified roles, the NS5B could interact with numerous cellular proteins to regulate the viral replication and these affirmative facts made it as precise target for anti-HCV drug discovery programs. The in depth anti-HCV agents which are discovered or designed by targeting the non-structural polyproteins were discussed in later sections.",

The CD81 factor, scavenger receptor B type I (SR-BI), dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecules (DC-SIGN & L-SIGN), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), asialoglycoprotein receptor and glycosaminoglycans were experimentally proved to be interacting with HCV particles during early stages to enable the viral entry into the host cell. The fusion between viral and cellular membrane leads to release the viral nucelocapsid into the host cytoplasm by receptor-mediated endocytosis and sometimes this process is pH dependant. The breakdown of nucleocapsid releases the free positively charged RNA particles into the cytoplasm. The RNA synthesis via internal ribosome entry site (IRES) occurs by interacting with other cellular proteins. The post-translational modifications take place to execute the bulky precursor non-structural polyproteins by targeting ER membrane. The maturity of core proteins, conformational changes and cleavage into its essential components acquires in this stage. The formation of HCV replication complex is another key step in viral reproduction initiated by NS4B protein by recruiting the cellular proteins to provoke vesicle formation. The replication complex is also formed by protein-protein interactions. The NS5B RdRp plays the significant deal in aggregation of positively charged single-strand RNA particles by various mechanisms.

Sustained virologic response (SVR) \u2013which is tantamount to cure is achieved only in a subset of treated patients, depending on a combination of viral and host-cell genetic factors [37]. For example, a human polymorphism at the IL28B gene is associated with poor interferon response [37]. Almost all patients undergoing interferon-based treatment also experience detrimental adverse effects, including flu-like symptoms, anemia, and depression [37]. Thus, current anti-HCV therapies are often not tolerated and becoming ineffective for most of the patients, and novel direct-acting antiviral drugs are required for safer, more efficacious treatment [37]. Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) have the potential to improve SVR rates and minimize treatment duration. As HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves the four known sites along the virally encoded polyprotein [38] and also hydrolyzes two human proteins, TRIF and MAVS, which are part of the innate immune system, there by confounding the innate immune response to viral infection [37].

As of 2010, treatments consist of a combination of pegylated interferon \u03b1 and the antiviral drug ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype 1 b. The cure rates by resulting treatment are reported as 70, 80% for genotype 2, 3, and 45\u201370% for other genotypes respectively [40]. The amalgamation of ribavirin and pegylated interferon-\u03b1-2a evidenced as superior procedure for treating HCV infections than grouping with pegylated interferon-\u03b1-2b [41]. Combining either boceprevir or telaprevir with ribavirin and pegylated interferon-\u03b1 improves antiviral response for hepatitis C genotype-1 [42]. Adverse effects with treatment are common, with half of people getting flu like symptoms and a third experiencing emotional problem. Treatment during the first six months is more effective than once hepatitis C has become chronic [43]. If someone develops a new infection and it has not cleared after eight to twelve weeks, 24 weeks of pegylated interferon therapy is recommended [43]. In people with thalassemia, ribavirin appears to be useful but increases the need for transfusions [44].

Both boceprevir and telaprevir are linear ketoamide compounds that form a reversible, covalent bond with the catalytic serine of NS3/4A protease [37]. Development of resistance is the one of the significant problem seen in the majority of patients undergoing protease inhibitor therapy and is suspected due to mutations in the NS3/4A region [1]. The R155K mutation in genotype 1a causes resistance against nearly all inhibitors and it is rarely observed in genotype 1b patients [37]. The distinct set of mutations stirred in genotype 1b patients depending on the class of protease inhibitor used; A156 mutates in response to treatment with linear ketoamide protease inhibitors while macrocyclic inhibitors more commonly selective for D168A and R155K variants. Mutations at V36, T54, and V36 + A155 are also associated with resistance to ketoamide inhibitors [37].",

Clearly, despite the benefits of combination therapy in improving SVR rates, the emergence of resistance challenges the long-term efficacy of NS3/4A protease inhibitors is being noticed [37]. The protease inhibitors danoprevir, TMC435, and boceprevir protrude from the substrate envelope in regions that correlate with known sites of resistance mutations. Notably, the large P2 moieties of danoprevir and TMC435 bind in the S2 subsite and extensively interact with residues R155, D168, and A156, which mutate to confer multi-drug resistance. The discovery of peptide based boceprevir as NS3-4A protease inhibitor by structure-based techniques produced new juncture for design few more penta and hexa peptide based anti-HCV agents. The typical \u03b1-ketoacid (54) derived from above strategy yielded the anti-HCV activity (Ki = 0.020 \u03bcM) and replacement of \u03b1-ketoacid with cystiene (Ki = 0.040 \u03bcM) (55) also retained the antiviral efficacy and found less when compared with parent scaffold (54).

            "text": "The cases with new acute infections are being raising every year and the mortality rate against chronic HCV infections are distressing the several nations. The mutations in the HCV viral strains, immune response to HCV disease are alleged be a foremost rate limiting issues for ongoing anti-HCV therapy and the precise, inexpensive pan-genotype direct acting anti-virals are required at the earliest. In this context, several direct acting HCV NS5B RNA polymerase inhibitors are employed as essential anti-virals that can be utilized either in blending with PEG-IFN, RBV or in mix with other DAAs in without interferon regimens. Similarly as with the advancement of very dynamic antiretroviral HIV treatment, the anti-HCV therapy would require to combat with the pan-genotype HCV viral burdens. This process delivered the several HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors including both nucleoside and non-nucleoside based inhibitors. A few new class of nucleoside HCV inhibitors exhibited promising anti-HCV regimen and are in human clinical trials. The development of nucleotide prodrugs to deliver nucleosides into hepatocytes is another powerful approach in nucleoside drug discovery and is useful in treating the liver associated HCV infections. The remarkable nucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate prodrugs has been entered into the clinical improvement and has indicated an extraordinary adequacy. In overall aspects, the current review might provide the significant information on the existing anti-HCV treatment strategy, development of target based anti-HCV agents and the other clinical agents.",
