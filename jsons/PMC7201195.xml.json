The development of\ncountry preparedness had been stimulated by the outbreak of H5N1 in chickens and\nsubsequent deaths in humans in Hong Kong in 1996. With its resurgence in late\n2003, not long after the end of the SARS outbreak, there were predictions that\nH5N1 might give rise to a pandemic, but it was not until the influenza A (H1N1)\npdm09 pandemic, in 2009, that there was the opportunity for a coordinated\ninternational response but plans were based on the assumption that an influenza\npandemic would start in Asia. It was unexpected that a pandemic of human\ninfluenza would arise in a developed nation. Genetic analysis points to the\norigin being swine in Mexico.7 An increase in influenza-like illness was seen in that country in\nmid-March 2009, and swine influenza A/H1N1, similar to recent cases in\nCalifornia, was confirmed in Mexico by Canada, and by April, 28 cases were\nreported by WHO in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.8 The H1N1 pandemic was the first Public Health Emergency of International\nConcern declared under IHR (2005). Canada was able to respond with well-prepared\nplans, but there were still challenges in vaccine supply and delivery. An\nexternal review of the functioning of the IHR (2005) during the H1N1 pandemic\nconcluded, \u201cthe world is (still) ill-prepared to respond to a\nsevere influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening\npublic-health emergency.\u201d9\n",
