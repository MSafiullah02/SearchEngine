The broadly-protective properties of the antibodies in IG products stem from their human origin and because they are purified from pools made up of large numbers of plasma donations. IG products manufactured in the United States (US), as well as some IG products manufactured in other countries, are derived from plasma collected exclusively from donation centers in the US, which can span the entire geography of the country. Safety measures implemented nearly two decades ago\u2014collaborative, industry-wide epidemiological surveillance of the donor population, judicious selection of donors, rigorous testing of plasma by serological and molecular (e.g., nucleic acid testing) methods and validation of manufacturing methods for virus clearance capacity\u2014provide a high degree of confidence that IG products, regardless of plasma origin, safely deliver a diverse, natural combination of human polyclonal antibodies1,2.",

Since the status of factors such as these can vary over time and across geographic regions, the profiles of antibodies among donors whose plasma is used to manufacture IG products are dynamic. For example, changes in viral antigen exposure in recent years have had a real impact on IG products\u2019 antibody levels against a number of viruses, among which are hepatitis A virus (HAV) and measles virus (MeV).",

Consequently, available IG preparations have been found to fall short of potency expectations10. This development has prompted Grifols, manufacturer of the lone IG product (GamaSTAN\u00ae) approved in the US for HAV prophylaxis, to update dosage regimens to ensure that adequate circulating anti-HAV immunoglobulin levels are reached in patients11,12. The use of widespread measles vaccination has had a similar effect on MeV-neutralizing antibodies in IG products for intravenous administration13. Nevertheless, human plasma IG augmentation therapy still offers the unique advantage of a diverse, polyvalent therapeutic antibody repertoire that cannot be obtained by any means other than purification of IG from large numbers of plasma donations collected across a wide geographic spectrum.",

The present study was designed primarily to examine the anti-HAV content, and potential benefit, of plasma obtained from donors in the Southwestern quarter of the US. In addition, since it is possible this plasma possesses elevated antibody levels to other infectious agents16, we examined levels of antibodies to MeV and human herpesvirus 5, also known as cytomegalovirus (CMV).",

Plasma was also obtained from one center, Clarksville, Tennessee (TN), outside of this region. The primary selection criterion for donation centers was proximity to regions of high HAV incidence and seroprevalence. While Texas and California have some of the highest incidence and seroprevalence rates in the US, Oklahoma and Utah\u2014which are loosely associated with the Southwest\u2014and Tennessee have relatively low incidence rates. Texas and California also have a higher foreign born population than the other states, which may contribute to the higher seroprevalence. Beyond the selection of states, criteria were: (1) centers that perform testing at the facility to allow for quick access to samples; (2) centers that have sufficient unique donors over a short time-span to produce an adequate sample size. Donors are allowed to donate two times per week, and since unique donors were desired, it was prudent to limit the collection period of samples to a few days in order to avoid duplicate donors.",

To this end, we tested plasma obtained from donor centers within the Southwestern quarter of the US. The data confirm that the notable anti-HAV Ig seroprevalence in particular areas of the US Southwest translates into elevated anti-HAV Ig titers in plasma collected at donation centers in those areas. Clearly, elevated antibody levels specific for HAV imply a higher incidence of infection. However, in areas where HAV is endemic, most infections occur during childhood and resolve without any lasting impact, except a robust anti-HAV response7. Fortunately, as suggested by the present study, healthy plasma donors emerge from such an area with elevated anti-HAV Ig titers. In fact, all plasma units from which samples for this study were pulled were negative for HAV RNA, an early marker of viral infection, by real-time qRT-PCR testing.",

But the anti-MeV IgG level observed in Midwest City-OK plasma was approximately 120% of that of El Paso-TX. While the result is subtle and inverted from that of anti-HAV Ig, the result is interesting nonetheless. It supports the premise that regional differences in seroprevalence helps to maintain efficacious antibody levels in IG products. Despite the recent decline in anti-MeV titers observed for some products, current IG preparations and doses are still sufficient to provide protection against MeV infection for PIDD patients24.",

A similar pattern is evident in the individual donations making up pools from centers with lower anti-HAV Ig titers. Furthermore, anti-HAV Ig titers in more than two-thirds of the individual donations from the high-titer centers were greater than the aggregate mean of plasma sample titers from the centers with lower titers.

Meanwhile, anti-MeV Ig titers in the general population have also been on the decline, which has caused some IG manufacturers to have had difficulty meeting the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product specification for anti-MeV content.
