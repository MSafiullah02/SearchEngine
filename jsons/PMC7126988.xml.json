            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous, highly host-specific herpesvirus that causes severe, sometimes life-threatening disease in congenitally infected newborns as well as in immunocompromised individuals such as bone marrow allograft transplant recipients and AIDS patients (Boeckh and Geballe, 2011, Chen et al., 2012).The ability to reactivate with high viral load from latency in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed hosts endowed HCMV with high pathogenesis (Slobedman et al., 2004). To date, no effective vaccine or antiviral drugs is available to prevent or treat HCMV infection. The most important and effective factor to prevent the development of serious complications after HCMV infection dwells in cellular immunity in humans (Einsele et al., 2002, Saffert and Kalejta, 2006), which may involved transcriptional alterations. Whereas a virus can potentially modulate the level of cellular mRNA by various mechanisms, identification of the cellular transcription alterations that are repressed or activated after HCMV latent infection could unveil the dynamic virus-host interaction and facilitate the development of antiviral therapy.",

During the last decade, the importance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as mediators involved in chromatin structure, gene regulation, subcellular structural organization, as well as nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking has begun to be recognized (Amaral and Mattick, 2008, Umlauf et al., 2008, Mercer et al., 2009). Recent studies have demonstrated the changes in host lncRNA expression in response to virus infection. In 2010, Yin et al.(Yin et al., 2013) observed the differential expression of more than 4,800 lncRNAs (2,990 lncRNAs were up-regulated, whereas 1,876 lncRNAs were down-regulated) in response to enterovirus 71(EV71) infection. Ouyanget al.(Ouyang et al., 2014) reported that a long noncoding RNA-negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) could modulate antiviral responses through suppression of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes transcription, including IFITM3 and MxA, after influenza Avirus (IAV) infection. These findings suggest the widespread differential expression of lncRNAs in response to virus infection and their potential roles in regulating the host response, including innate immunity.",

As a NGS technology, RNA-seq not only outperforms the conventional microarray in sensitivity and specificity, but is also able to detect new genes, lncRNAs, rare transcripts, alternative splice isoforms and novel SNPs, which extends the limited analysis scope of microarrays (Marioni et al., 2008, Morozova et al., 2009, Nielsen et al., 2011). Therefore, this technology has gained rapidly expanding application in transcriptomic studies (Wang et al., 2009, Qian et al., 2014). The present study adopted RNA-seq to identify global changes of mRNAs and lncRNAs in host cell during HCMV experimental latent infection of THP-1 cells, in an attempt to derive insights into the mechanism underlying alterations in response to infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the comprehensive transcriptome profile of both noncoding RNAs and mRNAs during HCMV experimental latent infection. These results fill the gap of knowledge in the complexity of the virus-cell interactions, and promise to offer clues with which the control of HCMV infection may advance.",

Apoptosis of virus-infected cells plays an essential role in the immune system, as its removal of viral survival environment controls the proliferation of intracellular pathogens (Tortorella et al., 2000). Apoptosis can be initiated via intrinsic pathway and the receptor-mediated pathway, which are mediated through endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion, respectively(Fulda and Debatin, 2006). Multiple previous studies indicated that human cells infected with HCMV undergo apoptosis(Browne et al., 2001, Challacombe et al., 2004).In this study, we found that 47 pro-apoptosis genes were up-regulated and 12 anti-apoptosis genes were down-regulated (especially BCL-2, 2.91-fold)at 4 days HCMV post infection (Table 4\n). Most of the up-regulated genes were involved in the mitochondrial pathway, including Bcl-2-binding component 3 (BBC3), CASP8 (2.58- and 2.49-fold, respectively). CASP8is one of the most crucial molecules for cell death induction(Barnhart et al., 2003). It may directly cleave downstream effector, such as caspase-3 and link the receptor to the mitochondrial pathway by cleavaging Bid to initiate a mitochondrial amplification loop(Adams and Cory, 2007). BBC3, a pro-apoptotic protein that effects as a p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), has the ability to inhibit the interaction between the anti-apoptotic molecules, Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic molecules, Bax and Bak and then result in apoptosis(Han et al., 2001, Nakano and Vousden, 2001). Many other genes involved in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways (TNFRSF10B and TNFSF14) and p53 signal transduction (ABL1, CDKN1A, CHEK2and HIPK2). This indicated that the TNF signal pathway and the p53 signal pathway were activated upon HCMV infection, but the detailed mechanisms still need further investigation.",

Assignment of GO terms included positive regulation of response to stimulus, positive regulation of immune system process, positive regulation of immune response and activation of immune response. In the course of HCMV infection in the host, on the one hand, host can induce non-specific and specific immune response to clear HCMV. We found that several genes encoding regulators of NF-\u03baB function were up-regulated, such as IL-1\u03b2, RELA, ICAM1 and CARD8 (7.53-, 2.09-, 4.21- and 2.06-fold, respectively). NF-\u03baB is one of the key players in stimulating the transcription of genes involved in cellular immuneresponse, as well as cell adhesion. Thus, it plays an important role in the antiviral defense (Ghosh and Karin, 2002). A previous study revealed that NF-\u03baB pathway could be induced by lytic HCMV infection(Challacombe et al., 2004). IL-1\u03b2 is an important mediator of the inflammatory response and it is one of the known inducers of RELA activity, supporting its participation in immune response. RELA, also known as p65, is a REL-associated protein involved in NF-\u03baB heterodimer formation, nuclear translocation and activation. In general, RELA participates in adaptive immunity and responses to invading pathogens via NF-\u03baB activation (Li and Verma, 2002). CARD8, is involved in pathways leading to activation of caspases or nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) in the context of apoptosis or inflammation, respectively. NF-\u03baB triggers transcription of various genes that were critical to inflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules including ICAM1 (Collins et al., 1995, Ledebur and Parks, 1995). Our results show that the expression levels of ICAM1 was elevated. ICAM1 can mediate leukocyte adhesion, and then transmigrate leukocytes into tissues resulting in inflammation(Yang et al., 2005). P2RX7 increasedin our study (3.13 foldchange). The product ofP2RX7 gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for ATP.P2X7 receptors play an important role in regulating inflammatory responses during acute viral infection (adenoviral vector) in ATP-mediatedinflammation (Lee et al., 2012).",

Consequently, viruses have manipulated host immune-control mechanisms to facilitate their propagation. HCMV is well-known for its ability to evade normal immune response pathways such as antigen presentation(Wiertz et al., 1997, Michelson, 1999, Loenen et al., 2001). Functional studies using purified complement components demonstrated that up-regulation of CD55 (5.26-fold) suppressed the activity of cell-associated C3 convertases on HCMV-infected cells. Furthermore, increased CD55 expression protected infected cells from complement-mediated lysis, an effect which directly correlated with the length of HCMV infection(Spear et al., 1995, Spiller et al., 1996). These negatively impacting cellular functions in the immune system, would severely compromise the host response to the infection.",

            "text": "Cell cycle and checkpoint control are intimately related to the outcome of herpesvirus infection. The complexity inherent in this virus-host interaction is becoming even more apparent (Goodrum et al., 2012). Seventy-three mRNAs encoding proteins with likely roles in cell cycle regulation were regulated by the virus (Table 4). The activation of protein kinases-cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) could trigger progression through the successive phases of the cell cycle. Whereas, the activities and specificities of these kinases are determined by their association with various cyclins and inhibitors which are differentially expressed during the cell cycle. Prevailing hypothesis proposes that proper temporal order of cell cycle was regulated by two major checkpoints(Hartwell and Weinert, 1989, Enoch and Nurse, 1991, Pines, 1993). One occurs at the G1/S transition and controls the initiation of DNA replication, and the other occurs at the G2/M transition just prior to mitosis and cell division. Some previous studies indicated that THP-1 cells infected with HCMV undergo cell cycle arrest. Lu M et al. (Lu and Shenk, 1996) have revealed a block in late G1, and Jault et al.(Johnson et al., 1993) described a block in G2/M. In our study, HCMV infection tends to inhibit cell cycle progression at multiple points, including the transition from G1 to S and G2 to M, consistent with previous research results.",

Many genes encode cell cycle regulators, especially cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A, 2.11-fold), also known as p21, is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that inhibits the complexes of CDK2 and CDK1 and up-regulated more than 2 fold change. p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). The p21 (CIP1/WAF1) protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-CDK2, -CDK1, and -CDK4/6 complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1 and S phase (Gartel and Radhakrishnan, 2005). Cyclin A (3.03-fold) plays an important role in promoting the progression from G2 to M phase. In our study, TGF\u03b21 (2.51-fold) were up-regulated. The inhibited expression of cyclin A was primarily modulated by TGF\u03b21 and may result in a block in G2/M (Djaborkhel et al., 2000).
