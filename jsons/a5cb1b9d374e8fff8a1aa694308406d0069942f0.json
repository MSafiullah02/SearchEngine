In fact, acute respiratory infections are very common during Hajj and represent the leading cause of the most hospitalizations. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] It has been suggested that more than one-third of pilgrims will suffer from respiratory symptoms during Hajj mostly due to the respiratory viruses. 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Most commonly isolated viruses from symptomatic patients during Hajj were human rhinoviruses (hRVs), influenza virus and non-MERS human coronaviruses (hCoVs). 2, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The emergence of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia, its endemicity, and high mortality rates (35%-40%) clearly represent another major public health concern, especially during Hajj.

Most Hajj pilgrims are usually old adults and elderly representing a high-risk group for influenza infection especially with the apparent high prevalence of influenza viruses during Hajj. These individuals are more susceptible to influenza viruses and prone to develop severe diseases. While seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all pilgrims, current Hajj regulations and guidelines for influenza vaccination require usage of seasonal trivalent vaccine formulation recommended for people younger than 65 years. These vaccines are known to be less immunogenic and less effective in the elderly compared with youngeradults. In addition, the several studies have shown low vaccination coverage among pilgrims attending multiple Hajj seasons.9,13,20,26,29,30,39 Furthermore, detection of influenza viruses is not uncommon among vaccinated individuals during Hajj or in returning pilgrims, mostly due to a possible mismatch between circulating and vaccine strains.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16]26,29,30,38,[40][41][42] Therefore, it is highly suggested to implement and adopt new influenza immunization guidelines for Hajj to improve vaccine coverage and to provide sufficient protection against influenza.Possible changes could include the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, high-dose vaccines for people older than 65 years and/or inclusion of both influenza vaccines from the northern and southern hemispheres for people younger than 65 years, especially if the two vaccines are different. Moreover, it might be beneficial to enhance human influenza surveillance during Hajj by including genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating strains to ensure strain match and to anticipate any potential early introduction of influenza viruses into Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, it is suggested that countries with", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "-25 More importantly, most global MERS cases were linked to travel to the Arabian peninsula. Although all surveillance studies during Hajj did not reveal any MERS-CoV infection among pilgrims, 10,16-19,26-31 serological testing showed positivity in one Turkish pilgrim who suffered from severe pneumonia and died upon ICU admission in Turkey. 6 Similarly, confirmed cases were reported from Dutch pilgrims returning home from the minor pilgrimage \"Umrah\". 32 While these studies suggest that MERS-CoV might not be problematic during Hajj so far, transmission of MERS-CoV is always possible especially during these mass-gathering events which could further lead to global spread. Therefore, MERS-CoV surveillance is highly warranted among pilgrims during and after Hajj. In this study, we performed enhanced surveillance for MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses among individuals with severe respiratory manifestation who presented to primary healthcare facilities during 2014 Hajj. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Samples During the 5 days of 2014 Hajj (from 3 to 7 October), a total of 132 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from all pilgrims presenting with acute severe respiratory tract symptoms and suspected for MERS-CoV infection at seven healthcare facilities in Makkah, Mina, and Arafat.

All swabs were collected in virus transport media and were immediately used for MERS-CoV testing on site and remaining samples were stored at \u221280 \u2218 C until further testing for other respiratory viruses at the Special Infectious Agents Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, and King Abdulaziz University (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Table 3).

First, the use of upper respiratory samples, NP swabs, for MERS-CoV detection may have led to missed MERS cases since they have lower viral load than that in lower respiratory specimens.43 However, NP swabs were used because of their easy collection and acceptance by pilgrims compared with bronchoalveolar lavages or tracheal aspirates, especially if there is no clinical indication. Second, it is possible that some MERS cases were also missed due to the asymptomatic infections or mild clinical symptoms. Therefore, larger sampling from pilgrims and their contacts as well as further testing for seroconversion might be used in future studies.
