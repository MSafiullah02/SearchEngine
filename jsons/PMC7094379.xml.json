During the outbreak in Taiwan, patients who were suspected of having SARS were randomly sent to designated hospitals by the Department of Health. There was therefore no particular bias as to where the patients were seen. A standard treatment protocol including ribavirin, which was recommended by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control, was used in 44 patients at Mackay Memorial Hospital (hospital M). Another seven patients from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (hospital C) received similar treatment with the exception of ribavirin, allowing a comparison of patients treated with and without ribavirin (Fig 1\n). All patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or real-time polymerase chain reaction on throat or nasopharyngeal swabs on at least two different occasions. The study population thus consisted of 44 SARS patients who were receiving ribavirin and 7 SARS patients who were not receiving ribavirin.",

If the patient's condition did not improve following 2 days of therapy with ribavirin, corticosteroids were added, starting with IV methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg q8h for 5 days then q12h for 5 days), followed by oral prednisolone, which was tapered over 11 days. If fever persisted and lung infiltrates or oxygenation worsened after 2 days of therapy with methylprednisolone, the patient was given pulse methylprednisolone (500 mg twice daily for 3 days) and/or IV Ig (1 mg/kg for 2 days). Oxygen therapy administered by nasal cannula, nonrebreathing mask, or mechanical ventilation was used to maintain the pulse oximetric saturation at > 95% or Pao\n2 at > 80 mm Hg.

Survival curves were obtained by Kaplan-Meier estimates and were compared by the log-rank test (two-sided p value). Multivariate logistic regression by backward stepwise analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors associated with the development of hypoxemia or mortality. The trend of hemoglobin change was compared between the S-R-NH and S-R-H groups by Student t test. The results were considered to be statistically significant if the p value was < 0.05.

A fall in hemoglobin level is a common side effect of ribavirin, but it has also been observed in patients with a variety of severe diseases, including SARS.19\n20 We found that 73% of SARS patients (32 of 44 patients) who were receiving ribavirin developed a decrease in hemoglobin level, compared with only 14% of SARS patients (1 of 7 patients) who were not receiving ribavirin (p = 0.006). We also found that, of patients who initially had been suspected of having SARS and therefore treated with ribavirin but who later proved to have other causes of pneumonia, approximately half (9 of 19 patients) became anemic during hospitalization. Hypoxemia was less common, with 17 of 44 patients (39%) who were receiving ribavirin and 1 of 7 patients (14%) who were not receiving ribavirin becoming hypoxemic during hospitalization. Perhaps the most striking finding among the patients who were receiving ribavirin was the number of deaths (5 of 17 patients; 29%) in hypoxemic, anemic patients, compared with that among patients who were not hypoxemic (0 of 27 patients). About half of patients in the latter group (15 of 27 patients) were anemic, although the mean hemoglobin level for the nonhypoxemic group as a whole remained normal or near-normal throughout the hospitalization. Only one of the seven patients who were not receiving ribavirin became hypoxemic, but this patient was not anemic (Fig 1). It is not possible to prove to what extent the anemia observed in this series was caused by ribavirin. However, it is reasonable to assume that a drug known to cause anemia may have contributed in part to the drop in hemoglobin.",

Thus, reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, most likely related at least in part to treatment with ribavirin, was superimposed on hypoxemia secondary to SARS-CoV-induced lung pathology.

In Canada, patients received a loading dose of 2 g IV, followed by 1 g IV every 6 h for 4 days, then 500 mg every 8 h for 3 to 6 days.15 However, over the course of the outbreak there, patients who had been treated with ribavirin appeared to have a worse outcome.19 Because of concern about its side effects and the lack of evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV either in vitro or anecdotally, Health Canada stopped providing ribavirin for the treatment of SARS several months into the outbreak.24 We used a lower dose of ribavirin in our treatment protocol. However, most of our patients had clinical progression of SARS after ribavirin therapy was begun, so they were given additional therapy such as steroids or IV Ig, according to the protocol. We observed no evidence in our patients to support a role for ribavirin in treating SARS.",

Anemic patients with pulmonary disease develop dyspnea, tachypnea, and severe hypoxia more easily than patients with a normal hemoglobin level. Global tissue hypoxia is an independent risk factor for microcirculatory failure, organ dysfunction, poor outcome, and death.29 Early goal-directed therapy carried out by maintaining central venous oxygen saturation at \u2265 70% with blood transfusion and providing O2 supplementation has been shown to decrease mortality significantly in critically ill patients.29 In our S-R-H patients, hypoxemia developed coincidentally with a fall in hemoglobin levels, so it is perhaps not surprising that they had a worse outcome than others in this series. These limited data suggest that patients with SARS require more intensive O2 therapy and possibly transfusion of RBCs to maintain the hemoglobin level at \u2265 12.0 mg/dL.",
