One may argue that the earliest use of the caution was by the Yellow Emperor Huang Ti (ca. 2600 BCE), who wrote: \"The most important requirement of the art of healing is that no mistakes or neglect occurs\" [2] . Smith attributes the specifi c expression, with its Latin version, to Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689), whom we remember for his classic descriptions of disease [3] . Herranz tells that the maxim to \"fi rst, do no harm\" entered the fabric of British and American medicine in 1849 when it was used in a book by Worthington Hooker titled Physician and Patient [4] . Today, I would wager that, whether in English or in Latin, there is not a US medical student who has survived to the clinical years who is not familiar with this adage.",

Then, exhausted and burned out, he took a year-long sabbatical in Finland (his wife's home), followed by a move to Washington DC. Here he devoted the next 10 years to serving the poor in a faith-based clinic far from the city's affl uent neighborhoods.

The fi rst is Sinclair Lewis' Doctor Martin Arrowsmith who, frustrated with rural practice, concludes: \"I shall never practice medicine again\u2026. I'm no good \u2026 I'm through.
