The virus initiates infection via the respiratory tract and replicates in various types of epithelial cells, including those of the kidney, gonads, and alimentary tract (Villegas, 1998; Saif et al., 2011). After the identification of the virus, a high diversity among isolates was reported, not only in antigenicity, but also in pathogenicity, and the nature of this virus motivated researchers to develop an efficient way to classify the isolates (Hofstad, 1958; Gelb et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2008).",

It is based on sequence analysis of the S1 portion of the S protein gene, which encodes the virus-neutralizing epitope and is responsible for viral attachment to cells (Ma et al., 2012). At least 3 genotypes of IBV have been identified in Korea by S1 sequence analysis (Lim et al., 2012). The KII type, one of the antigenic clusters of the Korean isolates, has frequently been isolated in field outbreaks and is related to nephropathogenic Chinese IBV strains (e.g., the ch/QXIBV strain; Lee et al., 2008). The rapid detection of variant isolates is the strongest aspect of the S1 sequence analysis method. However, because the presumed tissue tropism from this system is not always in agreement with the actual tissue tropism (Sapats et al., 1996), a more detailed understanding of the immunopathogenesis of IB infections is required. Such an understanding will enable scientists to be prepared for the emergence of variants with unusual tissue tropisms (Raj and Jones, 1997).",

The correlation between immunopathogenesis and disease progress is widely accepted in diverse studies. In the case of severe acute respiratory diseases, such as SARS, immunopathogenesis has been suggested to contribute to disease progression, providing the rationale for therapy with corticosteroids (Mu\u00f1oz-Fernandez, 2004). During H5N1 influenza infection, an excessive cytokine level in the blood and the innate immune response were suggested to play a role in disease progression (To et al., 2001; Peiris et al., 2004). In poultry, a role for cytokines in disease progression was suggested in Marek's disease, mycoplasmosis, salmonellosis, and coccidiosis (Laurent et al., 2001; Swaggerty et al., 2004; Withanage et al., 2004; Jarosinski et al., 2005; Mohammed et al., 2007).",

Briefly, the isolate of the KIIa genotype (kr/ADL110002/2011) was isolated from kidneys of 3-wk-old broilers suffering from severe nephritis, respiratory signs, and increased mortality (1% per day). According to S1 sequence analysis, this isolate belongs to the KIIa type, which is closely related to the QX-IB strain. The isolate of the ChVI genotype (kr/ADL120003/2012) was derived from 38-wk-old layers with a slight decrease in egg production. This genotype (ChVI) does not belong to major clusters of Korean IB isolates but appears to be derived from a Chinese strain (Liu et al., 2006). The virus stock for the challenge study was produced by inoculating field isolates into embryonated SPF chicken eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 72 h postinoculation. Reverse-transcription (RT) PCR targeting the IBV S1 gene was carried out, and each 630-bp S1 amplicon was sequenced for genotyping by the direct sequencing method. The median embryo infective dose (EID50) was determined by the Reed and Munch formula. The isolates were shown to be free from contamination by other avian pathogens by inoculating 3-wk-old SPF chicks and testing their sera at least 2 wk later using the procedures for the accreditation of SPF flocks. In this preliminary experiment, the chickens inoculated with the isolate kr/ADL110002/2011 showed severe nephritis after prolonged infection (>14 d), whereas no significant clinical symptoms were observed in chickens inoculated with the same dose of the isolate kr/ADL120003/2012.",

Forty-five 3-wk-old SPF chickens (VALO BioMedia North America, Adel, IA) were used and were divided into 3 groups of 15: an unchallenged control group (group 1), a group challenged with an isolate of the KIIa genotype (Kr/ADL110002/2011, group 2), and a group challenged with an isolate of the ChVI genotype (Kr/ADL120003/2012, group 3; Table 1). The chickens were inoculated with an eye drop of 0.2 mL of 105 EID50 of the IB isolates or 0.2 mL of sterilized PBS. At 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 d postinoculation (dpi), 3 birds in each group were bled before euthanasia, followed by necropsy and sample collection. The blood was kept at room temperature for approximately 3 h, and the serum was separated and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. During necropsy, tissues of the trachea and kidney were collected and immediately treated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for total RNA isolation; tissue samples were taken from the upper one-third of the trachea by the horizontal long axis and the upper left lobe of the kidney.",

To generate a standard curve, 105 EID50 of viral stock was serially diluted 10-fold, and RNA was extracted from each diluent. The RT-PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, and image analysis were conducted as described above, and the results were plotted against the dilution factor. For comparison, the corresponding value of a 105 dilution of the viral stock on the x-axis was normalized to 1, and the relative viral load for each sample was calculated according to the standard curve (Figure 1\n).",

To calculate the fold-change over the control chickens treated with PBS, the ratio of the concentration of the target gene to a reference gene (GAPDH) in samples from PBS-inoculated controls (calibrator) was normalized. The normalized ratio was then compared with the ratio of the concentration of the target gene to the reference gene in individual samples from IB-isolate inoculated chickens. The Mann-Whitney U test (SPSS 12.0 K for Windows) was used to determine significant differences between fold change values. The SD was calculated using the fold-change values of 3 replicates for each gene measured.",

The KIIa genotype (kr/ADL110002/2011), which is closely related to the nephropathogenic strain, induced clinical symptoms of depression and a stronger pro-inflammatory response. On the other hand, an active infection of the ChVI genotype isolate kr/ADL120003/2012, which resulted in an increase in serum AGP level at 9 dpi (Table 3), evoked only a limited range of pro-inflammatory responses. According to the data collected at 9 dpi, the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was temporally associated with clinical signs related to renal damage, such as an increased drinking of water and lesions observed in the kidney, including renal tubular necrosis. These data suggest that excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production contributes to disease severity. In particular, the excessive production of IL-6 in IB infections was already suspected to contribute to the exaggerated disease severity in specific genetic lines (Asif et al., 2007). Our data have different implications than the results of that study; we have demonstrated that specific IB genotypes induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and that differences in the scale of the induction could contribute to the disease severity induced by IBV of diverse genotypes.",

In chickens, LITAF has been investigated as a substitute for TNF-\u03b1 in viral infections (Ruby et al., 2006; Esnault et al., 2011), even though its involvement in viral infections was not demonstrated. In mammals, LITAF was reported to regulate TNF-\u03b1 gene expression (Myokai et al., 1999) and to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tang et al., 2005b). It is still debatable whether LITAF could be used as an indicator during viral infection, but our findings at 9 dpi demonstrate the upregulation of LITAF following IB infection, so a subsequent increase in transcription of TNF-\u03b1 could be anticipated. In mammals, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 are known to have tissue-damaging potential, including inducing apoptosis (Dinarello, 1996; Asif et al., 2007, Eizirik and Mandrup-Poulsen, 2001; Hehlgans and M\u00e4nnel, 2002) and local damaging effects on the kidney (van de Kar et al., 1992; Jo et al., 2002; Malaponte et al., 2002). In this study, these features, which were not previously reported in chickens, suggest that these cytokines may contribute to the pathological changes of renal disease in IB infection.",

            "text": "At 7 and 9 dpi, temporal associations between peak viral copy number and peak cytokine production were observed. However, the kinetics of viral load were not precisely in accord with those of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. In previous studies of influenza viruses, the differential hyper-induction of cytokines was not explained by differences in viral replication kinetics (Chan et al., 2005), but the accumulation of double-stranded RNA within the H5N1-infected cell appears to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of productive virus replication (Chan et al., 2012). In case of SARS-CoV infection, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was observed during in vivo studies (Wong et al., 2004), but a similar finding was not observed in in vitro studies of productively infected cells (Tang et al., 2005a). Instead, the induction of IL-6 was more significant in macrophages primed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Tseng et al., 2005). Thiel and Weber (2008) speculated that the pro-inflammatory response appears to be a secondary response of immune activation, not a direct response of cells against viral infection (Thiel and Weber, 2008). Based on these reports, we assume that the pro-inflammatory response is not a direct sequela of viral infection but is instead a secondary response, and the discordance in the kinetics is consistent with that assumption.",
