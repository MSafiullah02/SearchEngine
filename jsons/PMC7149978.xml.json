These DENV can cause a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic dengue infection to dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is estimated that close to 3.6 billion are at risk with 390 million infections of which 96 million are symptomatic. Among the 96 million symptomatic cases, 2 million end in severe form of infections, that is, DHF and DSS, and around 21,000 fatal cases occur annually around the world. Most of these infections occur in the developing and underdeveloped countries where the surveillance network for infectious diseases are not robust which means there is a possibility of gross underreporting of dengue. In this chapter we will discuss the evolution of virus and its vector, epidemiology of dengue, molecular and genomic structure of DENV, their pathogenesis, immune response of the host to the infection, laboratory diagnosis, management, and recent developments in dengue drug and vaccine development.",

Some authors speculated an African origin and subsequent distribution around the world with the slave trade (Ehrenkranz et al., 1971, Smith, 1956a). It has also been proposed that the viruses may have originated in a forest cycle involving lower primates and canopy-dwelling mosquitoes in the Malay Peninsula (Halstead, 1992, Smith, 1956a). Recent studies based on sequence data of dengue and other flaviviruses have suggested an African origin of the progenitor flavivirus, which ultimately branched into three genera, Flavivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus.",

The slave trade and the resulting commerce were responsible for the introduction and the widespread distribution of an African mosquito,\nA. aegypti, into the New World, most likely during the 17th century. This species became highly adapted to humans and the urban environment, and was ultimately spread throughout the tropics by the shipping industry.

In addition to the lack of political will, successful mosquito control programs were replaced by emergency response programs that relied on high-technology outdoor space spraying with nonresidual insecticides. Although very popular politically, these programs were never effective in interrupting transmission because they were usually initiated too late and in geographically limited areas. Moreover, the insecticide did not reach its targets, the adult A. aegypti, which were resting in secluded places inside houses (Gubler, 2011).",

Contributing to the problem were water storage practices in the cities where water supplies were unreliable, the use of nonbiodegradable containers for packaging consumer goods, and the rapidly growing automobile industry. Water storage containers such as plastics and used automobile and truck tyres provided ideal oviposition sites and larval habitats for A. aegypti mosquitoes (Gubler, 1994). Most mosquito control efforts since the early 1970s were directed toward adult mosquitoes using expensive methods that were ineffective, while changing lifestyles were providing increasingly more larval habitats. The result was large mosquito populations and crowded human populations living in intimate contact with each other and increased dengue transmission. Urban growth has been dramatic since the early 1960s, driven primarily by economic expansion, the cities of tropical developing countries exploded, with millions of susceptible people migrating from rural areas (Gubler, 2011).",

During the war, existing water systems were destroyed, and water was stored for domestic use as well as for fire control. Military equipment and junk were left behind, making ideal larval habitats for A. aegypti. The movement of equipment and other war activities resulted in the transport of mosquitoes and their eggs to new geographic areas (Guzman et al., 2010). The result was a greatly expanded geographic distribution and increased densities of A. aegypti and increased epidemic dengue activity (Bhatia et al., 2013). The economic expansion was the driving force of unprecedented urban growth that continues today (Ferreira, 2012). Housing, water, sewer, and waste management were inadequate. The vector population thus increased dramatically in the crowded, unhygienic cities of Asia, as mosquito control measures was not effective. The economic expansion also led to increased movement of people (along with them the viruses also moved among cities and countries in the region). Those countries that did not already have hyperendemic rapidly became hyperendemic (Gubler, 2011).",

From the 1970s to the present time, there has been a dramatic geographic expansion of epidemic DHF in the countries of Asia and from there to the Pacific and the Americas (Bhatia et al., 2013). Japan routinely experienced dengue epidemics in its southern islands of Okinawa and Formosa (Taiwan), but the Japanese mainland was not affected until the Second World War (Hotta, 1953). Following the Second World War, the isolation of the Pacific resulted in the disappearance of DENVs from the area for 20 years. In the late 1971, explosive epidemics of DF were caused by DENV-2 (Moreau et al., 1973). In 1974 DENV-1 was reintroduced into the Pacific from Asia and rapidly spread throughout the islands in a pattern similar to that of DENV-2 (Kuberski et al., 1977).

Although A. aegypti was probably never eradicated from Northern Queensland, a combination of improved water systems and control programs reduced the populations to very low levels during the 1960s and 1970s, when dengue transmission was not reported. After an absence of 26 years, dengue reappeared in Northern Queensland in 1981/82 with DENV-1 causing an outbreak in several cities (Kay et al., 1984). In the Americas, from 1946 to 1963, there was no evidence of dengue epidemic, and this quiescence was due to several factors, but of importance was the A. aegypti eradication program by Pan America Health Organization which was aimed at reducing the YF outbreaks (Gubler, 2014). The eradication program was discontinued in the early 1970s because urban epidemics of dengue and YF were no longer a problem. Failure to eradicate A. aegypti from the whole region, however, resulted in repeated reinvasions by this mosquito into those countries that had achieved eradication. During the 1970s, support for mosquito surveillance and control programs waned, and by the end of the decade, many countries had been reinfested with A. aegypti (Gubler, 1989a). In 2012 A. aegypti had a distribution similar to that in the 1940s, before eradication was initiated; only Bermuda and Chile remain free of this mosquito. A characteristic of dengue in the Americas from 1963 through the early 1980s was hypoendemicity, that is, only a single serotype was present at any one time in most countries (Gubler, 1989b). Thus reinvasion of Central and South America by A. aegypti in the 1970s and 1980s, combined with increased urbanization and movement of people, and with them DENVs and mosquito vectors, which spread via commerce, resulted in most countries evolving from nonendemicity (no viruses present) or hypoendemicity (one virus present) to hyperendemicity (multiple virus serotypes present) (Rigau-P\u00e9rez et al., 1998).\n",

During the postwar years, when the DHF syndrome was first described, the severe disease was sporadic and localized in a few Southeast Asian countries. In the 1970s, however, the disease began to spread, first within Asia and then to the Pacific and tropical America. Due to factors such as lack of political will, successful mosquito control programs were replaced by emergency response programs that relied on high-technology outdoor space spraying with nonresidual insecticides. Although very popular politically, these programs were never effective in interrupting transmission, because they were usually initiated too late, and in geographically limited areas. Moreover, the insecticide did not reach its targets, the adult A. aegypti, which were resting in secluded places inside houses (Gubler, 2011, Murray et al., 2013).",

Contributing to the problem were water storage practices in the cities where water supplies were unreliable, the use of nonbiodegradable containers for packaging consumer goods, and the rapidly growing automobile industry. Water storage containers such as plastics and used automobile and truck tyres provided ideal oviposition sites and larval habitats for A. aegypti mosquitoes. Most mosquito control efforts since the early 1970s were directed toward adult mosquitoes using expensive methods that were ineffective, while changing lifestyles were providing increasingly more larval habitats. The result was large mosquito populations and crowded human populations living in intimate contact with each other, and increased dengue transmission (Banerjee et al., 2015) (Fig. 16.1\n).",

There are areas of uncertainty in measuring the economic loss associated with dengue. First, estimating the total episodes of dengue is difficult due to paucity of data. Second, there is some evidence suggesting that the rate of underreporting varies by the severity of dengue, with better reporting for more severe cases of dengue (Duarte and Franca, 2006). Third, most estimates of the economic cost of dengue only include the febrile (1\u20137 days) and subsequent critical phase of dengue, totaling ~12 days (Lum et al., 2008, Suaya et al., 2009). But dengue leads to substantial reduction in the patients\u2019 quality of life during and after the febrile period. Last, there is considerable uncertainty in the burden of dengue in large parts of the world, including the Western Pacific, South Asia, and Africa. While there have been several reports of dengue outbreaks occurring in these regions, many countries do not have surveillance systems to monitor and report dengue episodes, or lack accurate identification methods. Another area of uncertainty includes population\u2019s health-seeking behavior and the multiplicity of sites for treatment with privately treated patients having modest rate of reporting and near nil reporting from patients seeking alternate method of treatment such as pharmacy or traditional medicine (Suaya et al., 2009).",

In addition, insecticide resistance is a challenge that can lead to failure of dengue control programs and complicates the control activities further by increasing the magnitude of future dengue epidemics. Economic analysis of other dengue control technologies under development, such as genetics-based sterile insect methods, infection of mosquitoes with Wolbachia, and vaccination, are important to guide investment for these technologies, policy formulation, adaptation, and adoption of these technologies, and thereby mitigate the economic and burden of dengue illness in the future (Luz et al., 2011).",

This analysis concluded that vaccination, when available, will be the most cost-effective policy. In addition, it is much more favorable than the US$3368 per DALY saved from environmental management (Zeng et al., 2018). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a dengue vaccine in Southeast Asia, estimated at US$62.47 per DALY saved (in 2011 US$), is comparable to most favorable public health programs for children, which cost on average <US$100 per DALY saved (in 2011 US$) (Shepard et al., 2012). The economic burden of dengue in the absence of any effective vaccine for the cohort was US$123.70 per 1000 population per year, of which 67% is due to DHF. The situation with the highest incidence of DHF and lower vaccine price in the public sector makes the vaccine the most cost-effective (Shepard et al., 2004).",

Studies on molecular virology of viruses have been made possible by the use of full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clones, genomic RNA with reporter genes and replicons. Full-length cDNA clones of four serotypes of dengue have been constructed and is being used to study their molecular biology (Kapoor et al., 1995, Kinney et al., 1997, Lai et al., 1991, Suzuki et al., 2007). These infectious clones have been used to genetically manipulate different regions of the viral RNA to define functions of viral proteins and RNA structures, to study virus\u2013cell interactions, and to generate live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Another important advance has been the development of genomic and subgenomic DENV RNAs containing reporter genes, such as luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Schoggins et al., 2012, Zou et al., 2011). These tools have been used to study functions of viral proteins and RNAs in each step of the viral life cycle (Samsa et al., 2012). Also reporter-containing viruses have been employed to study viral functions and host\u2013virus interactions during viral entry, viral translation, RNA synthesis, and formation of infectious viral particles. Replicons are yet another useful tool to evaluate translation and viral RNA amplification, which can be followed by measuring reporter activity as a function of time after RNA transfection.",

The 3\u2032 end of the genome lacks a polyadenylate tail and terminates in a conserved 5\u2032-CU-OH 3\u2032 (Wengler and Wengler, 1981). The genome encodes a single ORF flanked by highly structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). The 5\u2032and 3\u2032 terminal RNA sequences of the genome form large stem loop structures known as stem loop A (SLA) and 3\u2032 stem loop (3\u2032 SL), respectively, both essential for viral replication. The 5\u2032 UTR sequences of the four DENV serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) are between 95 to 101 nucleotides long, while the 3\u2032 UTRs range from 470 nucleotides in the case of DENV-1 to ~385 nucleotides in DENV-4. An important feature of DENV and other flavivirus genomes is the presence of inverted complementary sequences (CSs) at the ends of the RNA.

To be catalytically active, the N-terminal domain of NS3 must associate with a hydrophilic domain of the membrane-associated NS2B protein that acts as a cofactor. NS3 represents an important target for the development of specific antiviral inhibitors (Patkar and Kuhn, 2008, Reiser et al., 2005). NS3 bears multiple essential enzymatic activities. Besides the N-terminal two-component serine protease domain necessary for polyprotein processing, it contains three different enzymatic activities in the C-terminal domain: NTPase, RNA triphosphatase (RTPase), and RNA helicase (Benarroch et al., 2004, Yon et al., 2005). Other possible functions include unwinding dsRNA intermediates that arise during RNA amplification, destabilizing secondary structures of the RNA to increase polymerase processivity, participating in RNA recruitment at specific subcellular locations, acting as RNPases stripping proteins from the viral RNA, and remodeling RNA structures that may function as modulators of the viral processes. NS4B with NS3 was found to induce NS3 dissociation from ssRNA and promote dsRNA unwinding activity (Umareddy et al., 2006).

In the low pH environment of the endosome, the domain II of the E protein flips up, exposing its fusion loop, thereby leading to the insertion of the fusion loop into the endosomal membrane. The membrane may then catalyze trimerization, causing the formation of a prefusion intermediate. Trimerization then spreads from the fusion tip of E protein downward to domain I at the base of the trimer. Domain III then rotates and shifts, displacing the trimers, which in turn cause the endosomal and viral membrane to fuse. The fusion of membranes may require concerted twisting of a few trimeric E proteins.",

Enhanced replication in mosquitoes may contribute to global spread and success of a strain due to faster dissemination in the mosquito and a shorter extrinsic incubation period (Anderson and Rico-Hesse, 2006, Gubler and Rosen, 1977). Also cross-reactive immune responses in human populations may also confer a selective advantage to particular clades or genotypes of DENV, such that strains capable of evading host adaptive immune responses are able to outcompete other strains in the population (OhAinle et al., 2011, Vu et al., 2010).",

Also inappropriate cross-reactive adaptive immune response during sequential DENV infection may lead to the more severe immunopathogenesis, that is, characteristic of DHF/DSS. Changes in viral proteins that interact with the host may impact viral virulence. Such interactions include the interaction of NS1 with the host complement pathway (Avirutnan et al., 2006), potential immune recognition of NS1 bound to endothelial cells of the vascular system (Avirutnan et al., 2007, Chen et al., 1997), or cleavage during maturation of NS4B that appears to induce immunomediators from monocytes that increase endothelial cell permeability (Kelley et al., 2012). Finally, differences in the breadth of diversity of circulating DENV genomes during acute infection (\u201cintrahost diversity\u201d) have been hypothesized to play a role in determining disease outcome (Descloux et al., 2009).",

Highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been proposed to have an association with either disease susceptibility or protection (Coffey et al., 2009). HLA-A*0203 was associated with less severe disease irrespective of the infecting serotype, whereas HLA-A*0207 was associated with more severe disease only in patients with secondary DENV-1 and DENV-2. In contrast, HLA-A*B51 was associated with more severe disease irrespective of serotype, and HLA-A*B52 was associated with a less severe disease phenotype in secondary infections with DENV-1 and DENV-2. In addition, various HLA-B alleles (B44, B62, B76, and B77) appeared to protect against the development of clinical disease from secondary DENV infection (Stephens et al., 2002). Also, HLA-A*A24 was overrepresented in patients with severe disease, whereas HLA-DRB1*0901 was underrepresented, suggesting an association with susceptibility and protection, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2008).",

Instead these low avidity cross-reactive antibodies may opsonize the virus and lead to its targeting FcR bearing cells such as macrophage/monocytes, leading to internalization and increased virus replication. Fc-RIa and Fc-RIIa have been shown to promote ADE and cytoplasmic domains that contain immuno-tyrosine activation motifs are essential for this function by promoting endocytosis of immune complexes (Halstead and O\u2019Rourke, 1977a, Halstead and O\u2019Rourke, 1977b).",

ADE has been demonstrated to increase virus replication in primate models following passive transfer of polyclonal human serum or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Goncalvez et al., 2007, Halstead et al., 1973a). Anti-prM antibodies are a particularly interesting group of antibodies with respect to ADE. Anti-prM antibodies show poor neutralization and typically, even at high concentrations, neutralization plateaus at 30%\u201350%. The reason for this is likely to do with virus maturation; fully mature virus particles do not contain prM and are thus not neutralized, whereas many partially mature virus particles contain enough prM to bind antibody and drive ADE but do not have enough prM epitopes to allow sufficient antibody density for neutralization. Furthermore, virions with high levels of prM are not infectious but can be driven to infect cells by ADE with anti-prM antibodies (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010, Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010). This results in endocytosis and sufficient prM processing to allow membrane fusion.",

In early clinical studies, reduced levels of C3, C4, and factor B, and increased catabolic rates of C3 and C1q were observed, particularly in patients with severe DENV disease during secondary infection (Bokisch et al., 1973). In addition, C3 split products and anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) accumulated in the circulation of ill patients and peaked at the day of maximum vascular leakage (Malasit, 1987). DENV-infected cells may display sufficient amounts of DENV antigens (prM, E, or NS1 proteins) on their surface to facilitate immune complex formation and complement deposition. Indeed, DENV-infected endothelial cells activate human complement in the presence of antibodies resulting in C5b-9 deposition (Avirutnan et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Type I IFN production cascade is triggered after virus infection, because the sensors for this cascade, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and cytoplasmic receptors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG I) and MDA5, or RIG I\u2013like receptors (RLRs) can detect virus-specific elements (PAMPs) and initiate the cascade (Ashour et al., 2010). The activation of this cascade results in the production of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 (type I IFNs) by cells and the subsequent secretion of these antiviral cytokines that can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner by binding to the IFN\u03b1\u03b2 receptors and triggering the IFN signaling cascade; this culminates in the activation of ISGs-containing IFN-stimulated response elements that have antiviral activity (Kawai and Akira, 2007). DENV has been reported to be sensed by several TLRs and RLRs, including TLR3, TLR7, RIG I and MDA5 (Nasirudeen et al., 2011). Several DENV proteins had been identified as inhibitors of type I IFN signaling. By inhibiting both the detection and effector arms of this important pathway, the virus can stop the production of type I IFNs that would trigger the induction of hundreds of ISGs. Also DENV can inhibit the production of type I IFN in infected primary human cells, such as monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages. This inhibition is mediated by an active protease complex (NS2B3) which targets a key host factor, STING (also named MITA) (Morrison et al., 2012). STING is an adaptor molecule for type I IFN production that mediates the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3, which then translocates to the nucleus and participates in the activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter. In addition to the direct effects on viral replication, by inhibiting type I IFN production in human DCs, DENV may affect the quality of the adaptive immune response generated after infection.",

During the early stages of illness, virus isolation, antigen, and nucleic acid detection can be used to diagnose the infection.

Antibody titers continue to rise slowly over a period of weeks and remain detectable probably for a lifetime. In secondary infections, IgG antibody rapidly rises almost immediately after fever onset, with high levels in most patients IgM antibody as well as a high titer of IgG in a single serum are used as markers of a recent dengue infection. The detection of a fourfold IgG or IgM increase or antibody seroconversion in paired sera is considered to be confirmatory for infection.

The ineffectiveness of these efforts is due in part to insufficient monitoring and a lack of well-designed programs but is exacerbated by the rise in the level of insecticide resistance.",

The plasmid contains a eukaryotic promoter and termination sequence to drive transcription in the vaccine recipient. The transcribed RNA is translated to produce proteins to be processed and presented to the immune system in the context of MHC molecules. Additional genes such as intracellular trafficking and immunostimulatory sequences can be added to the plasmid. The target organism\u2019s immune system recognizes the expressed antigen, and generates antibodies and/or cell-mediated immune responses. DNA-based vaccine constructs can be modified without the need for subsequent viability as required when working with infectious clones. DNA vaccines afford numerous advantages over conventional vaccines, including ease of production, stability, and transport at room temperature, and they provide a possibility to immunize against multiple pathogens with a single vaccine. Workers at the US Naval Medical Research Institute evaluated two eukaryotic plasmid expression vectors (pkCMVint-Polyli and pVR1012,) expressing the PrM protein and 92% of the E protein for DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain). Both constructs induced neutralizing antibody in all mice (Kochel et al., 1997). But various improvements to the original construct have been made, and animal trials are underway to evaluate their immunogenicity and efficacy.",
