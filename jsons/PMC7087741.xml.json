She presented an elegant example using the highly conserved PDX1 protein in the fat sand rat, Psammomys obesus. Sand rat PDX1 shares only 15/60 amino acids with other rodent species due to high GC content, which she showed alters protein stability through mutation of key ubiquitination sites. Dai provided evidence that the sand rat evolved to acquire a new ubiquitination site, demonstrating a tug-of-war between natural selection and strong GC skew. At a functional level, sand rat PDX1 appears to be less efficient at activating insulin in pancreatic beta-cells compared to mouse PDX1. A similar pattern of sequence divergence was observed in other sand rat genes involved in diabetes and obesity, which could explain why sand rats develop obesity and diabetes when fed a normal chow diet.",

Specifically, his work looks at the cellular cascade of events that precedes Parkinson\u2019s disease, which causes severe neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology shows many parallels with diabetes, particularly with respect to impaired energy metabolism. Patients with diabetes have a significantly higher risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s, and diabetic drugs have been shown to have neuro-protective effects in Parkinson\u2019s patients. The computational analysis of existing data developed by Balling and others made a key contribution to Parkinson's disease research and to the finding of an impaired energy supply. Balling demonstrated that in Parkinson\u2019s patients with a mutation in a familial PD-gene, the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme regulating the switch between glycolysis and the TCA cycle, is affected. As a result of this hypo-energetic state, neurons might be forced to break down neurotransmitters as substrates to be fed into the TCA cycle. Based on this hypothesis, Balling suggested that Parkinson\u2019s disease could be considered \u201cthe diabetes of the brain\u201d, and linked the continuing rise in diabetes and obesity with an increase in neuropsychiatric disorders over time.",

Fufa Temesgen\u2019s study took an epigenomics approach to better understand retinal development and disease. Using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into retinal pigment epithelium, she mapped key regulatory regions genome-wide and identified specific transcription factor motifs enriched at these sites. Importantly, by performing whole-genome sequencing on families with macular dysplasia, she linked a hereditary translocation in a gene desert region with important putative enhancers active during retinal development, underscoring the importance of these regulatory regions in health and disease. Blake Caldwell presented his work using iPSCs to study the role of DNA methylation in reprogramming, which is dependent on TET active DNA demethylases. He showed that iPSC reprogramming efficiency is highly dependent on TET2 catalytic activity, with overexpression of TET2 leading to enhanced reprogramming, while expression of a catalytically dead version of TET2 has the opposite effect. These studies directly implicate TET2\u2032s role in actively promoting Base Excision Repair in iPSC derivation, particularly at reprogramming-specific promoters and enhancers.",

ATAC-seq and RNA-seq were used to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in 185 mESC lines from the genetically heterogeneous Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population. Genetic mapping identified 11 clusters of co-localized distant QTL, suggesting broadly important regulatory factors. Mediation analysis identified Lifr expression as the intermediate factor for one of these clusters tied to gene expression of pluripotency factors, and a single enhancer variant upstream of Lifr was validated to be causal using reciprocal allele swaps. Expanding Reinholdt\u2019s work on genetic regulation of ground state pluripotency in DO-derived mESCs, Steve Munger discussed transcriptional analysis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from mESCs. Combined with the transcriptional analysis of the mESCs, Munger showed how transcriptional variation in the differentiated NPCs was affected not only by the genetic variation but also by the transcriptional variation of the progenitor cells at ground state. Genetic mapping identified eQTL that were both shared with mESCs and specific to NPCs. While local variants tended to have effects in both cell types, distant trans-regulatory variants were generally cell type specific. Mediation analysis showed that transcriptional variation in differentiated NPCs can be driven by transcriptional variation in progenitor mESCs.",

Lisa Gralinski took a genetic mapping approach to identify host factors regulating differential SARS coronavirus susceptibility in two closely related substrains, BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ. Analysis of the early immune response in these strains suggested that aberrant signaling is likely driving these different disease outcomes. In the reduced complexity F2 intercross, two QTL were mapped for weight loss and shown to act additively, with resistance being recessive for both. To reduce the pool of candidates within the loci, Gralinski is utilizing approaches that include screening of additional BALB/c substrains for susceptibility and performing fine mapping via PCR. Jean Jaubert discussed an extreme susceptibility phenotype to Salmonella bacteria observed in Collaborative Cross CC042/GeniUnc (CC042) mice, which show very high bacterial loads and mortality. CC042 mice have a number of distinct immunological features, including reduced splenocytes and thymocytes. An F2 intercross between CC042 and C57BL/6N was performed to map the genetic loci underlying susceptibility, and two independent QTL on Chromosome 7 were identified. One of these QTL was attributed to a CC042-specific private mutation resulting in complete loss of function of the Itgal gene, the effect of which was confirmed by quantitative complementation.",

Discussions focused on promoting responsible and reproducible research that is readily accessible, as well as the importance of nomenclature standardization and ongoing resource sustainability. Complementary to this panel, Carol Bult presented an overview of The Alliance of Genome Resources (the Alliance), a comprehensive tool that provides integrated genomic and phenotypic data across the major model organisms. The goals of the Alliance are (1) to have a common mechanism to access data from model organism databases and the Gene Ontology Consortium and (2) to maintain a sustainable modular infrastructure for genome resources to reduce development and maintenance costs. For individual genes, comparative gene expression can be compared through development and anatomy across model organisms. Further, comparative disease associations can be analyzed harmoniously between species, which has historically been challenging for researchers due to each model organism database annotating genes and phenotypes differently. The Alliance hopes that by unifying common tools for data curation, access and analysis will both advance research at a quicker pace and allow for long-term sustainability as these resources expand.",

Physiological traits, such as body fat and insulin levels, were measured across the entire mapping population, while transcriptional analysis of liver and adipose tissue was conducted in a subset of rats. Mapping used both SNP- and haplotype-based methods, and a subset of QTL were identified by both approaches. eQTL mapping was followed by mediation analysis, which identified Krtcap3 as a candidate gene within a pleiotropic QTL that affected fat pad size and fasting triglycerides. Preliminary studies demonstrated that CRISPR knockout of Krtcap3 leads to increased body weight, supporting a role for this gene in regulating metabolic traits. Krtcap3 is also present in a human locus mapped for waist\u2013hip ratio, suggesting translational relevance of this gene.",
