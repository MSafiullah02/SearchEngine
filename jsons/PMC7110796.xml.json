The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia.1 Ixodid ticks, especially those of the genus Hyalomma, are both a reservoir and a vector for the virus. The CCHF virus (CCHFV), a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, has been isolated from 30 species of ixodid tick.2 Numerous domestic and wild animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, small mammals, rodents, and birds, in which the infection is mainly asymptomatic, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus.3 There is no specific treatment or vaccine against CCHF and it is considered an emerging arboviral zoonotic disease in many countries, possibly due to increased vector bionomics and climate change.",

Despite the rapidly growing incidence of the disease, there are currently no accurate data on the burden of the disease in the region due to the different surveillance systems for CCHF used in these countries. Moreover, there is no definitive preventive and control strategy for CCHF owing to the fact that many aspects of the disease, such as the maintenance and transmission of the virus and the pathogenesis of the disease in humans, remain poorly understood.4 In an effort to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors for the transmission of CCHFV in the WHO EMR, and to identify current knowledge gaps that are hindering effective control interventions, a sub-regional meeting was organized in Muscat, Oman from December 7 to 9, 2015. This article summarizes the outcomes of that meeting concerning current knowledge of the disease in the region and the future directions for research and control.",

In Europe, Hyalomma marginatum is the main CCHFV vector, while Hyalomma asiaticum appears to be the principal vector in Asia. In 2006, H. marginatum was detected for the first time in the Netherlands and in southern Germany.7, 8 Additionally, CCHFV was reported for the first time in India in January 2011, linked to Hyalomma anatollicum ticks.9\n",

Hyalomma ticks favour dry climates and arid types of vegetation, in areas with abundant small and large mammals that can support haematophagy and the different stages of the tick life-cycle. Environmental factors (such as climate) and human behaviour are critical determinants for the establishment and maintenance of CCHF endemicity within an area. Humans may modify the risk of CCHFV transmission through changes in land use, recreational activities, and movement and trade of infected livestock.10\n",

The infection can also be acquired by percutaneous and permucosal routes, through contact with animal blood or tissues. The possibility of aerosol transmission has been suspected in a few instances in Russia, but no definite evidence exists.12, 13 Only one study has suggested possible sexual transmission of CCHFV,14 but further research is needed to study the persistence of CCHFV in the body fluids of survivors. Livestock and abattoir workers, as well as individuals involved in backyard slaughtering in endemic areas, remain at an increased risk of infection due to the risk of occupational exposure.",

Low levels of awareness concerning CCHF symptoms at the early stages of the disease, especially at the primary care level and in hospital departments for non-communicable diseases, has led to clinical diagnostic mistakes, inappropriate case management, and poor infection control measures. A key problem here is that the surveillance case definition for human infection of CCHF is not standardized,4, 7 and different endemic countries use different case definitions. This represents a major gap and may contribute to the varied mortality rates across countries. Some countries, for example, only report patients with severe disease and bleeding at a late stage, which results in artificially very high mortality rates, while others have more sensitive systems for early case detection, even when clinical symptoms of haemorrhage are not apparent, resulting in lower mortality rates.23 Thus, there is a need for consensus in establishing a standard case definition for CCHF. An algorithm for early identification and diagnosis of cases would be of great value.",

However, specific IgM and IgG antibodies appear late in the course of infection (5\u20137 days after the onset of symptoms) and in some circumstances may never be detected. The presence of CCHFV in the blood of a patient can be diagnosed early by detecting viral RNA using RT-PCR.52 Unfortunately, the CCHFV RNA RT-PCR diagnostic test is most commonly performed in reference laboratories . In consequence, diagnostic reports may take 3\u20135 days or even longer to become available. Given the fact that early diagnosis of CCHF is of paramount importance for infection control and to establish early effective symptomatic treatment, there is an urgent need to develop a simple rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or point-of-care nucleic acid test (NAT) for CCHFV. Ideally these tests should be based on the detection of specific CCHF nucleic acids or antigens. The use of accurate and simple-to-use diagnostic assays would enhance early diagnosis and case detection in the primary care setting. In this context, it would be useful if a range of CCHFV-positive samples from the affected countries could be collected and stored in accessible biobanks in order to facilitate the development and validation of point-of-care RDTs and NATs for CCHFV infection. Such RDTs would be used at the point of care and would help with the rapid control of human CCHFV infection.",

This may be due firstly to poor recognition of CCHF by physicians; single sporadic cases tend to occur in rural areas, and many patients develop a mild, non-specific illness, without a recognizable haemorrhagic fever syndrome.

These include the following:(1)The standardization of case definitions for the early detection of CCHF patients in both endemic and non-endemic countries. This would allow the uniform and consistent use and implementation of these case definitions across all endemic and high-risk countries in the region.(2)The development of assays for CCHF RNA quantification that are rapid, precise, easy to implement at the point of care in resource-limited settings, and sufficiently robust to operate under field conditions. This would enhance diagnosis and early case detection in the primary care setting.(3)The design and execution of an RCT to properly validate or refute the efficacy of ribavirin, favipiravir (T-705), and monoclonal antibodies as treatments against CCHF. A successful RCT for CCHF therapeutics will rely on collaboration between endemic countries and a united front for the sharing of information across the health and research communities.(4)The development of an algorithm as an aid to help clinicians rapidly establish the presumptive/initial clinical diagnosis of patients on the basis of the presenting clinical, epidemiological, occupational, and other demographic characteristics. This would be of great practical use, due to the fact that the clinical manifestations of CCHF during its initial clinical phase resemble those of many other arboviral diseases, especially Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, and dengue fever during the summer and influenza and respiratory diseases during the winter season in endemic countries.(5)Sero-epidemiological studies on CCHF for human and animal infection in the region, including in non-endemic countries, since there is limited knowledge and understanding of the burden of CCHF, as well as its animal reservoirs in the region.(6)The development of a set of risk communication messages for high-risk groups through collaborative engagement between the animal and human health sectors. These messages must be evidence-based, consistent, and follow the currently available knowledge and best practices.(7)The identification of best surveillance practices for animal health for the early detection of potential risks of spill-over of CCHFV into humans.(8)The design and implementation of studies to develop animal CCHF and/or Hyalomma anti-tick vaccines. Increasing domestic animal immunity against CCHF or Hyalomma ticks would be an important element of a strong CCHF prevention programme.(9)The ranking of areas by CCHFV risk estimation and the spatial\u2013temporal forecasting of CCHFV circulation and future outbreaks.\n",
