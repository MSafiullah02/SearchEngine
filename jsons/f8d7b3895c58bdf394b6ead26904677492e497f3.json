            "text": "F rom February to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread rapidly in northern Italy, resulting in a severe emergency for the national health-care system. Despite the best efforts of the health-care network of Lombardy to manage a large number of patients, the rapid spread of infection quickly led to a saturation of intensive-care units throughout the region 1 . As of April 1, 2020, >9,171 cases have been diagnosed in the city of Bergamo alone 2 . In our hospital, Humanitas Gavazzeni of Bergamo (Lombardy, Italy), both medical and surgical activities have been rapidly reformulated and are key to maximizing assistance to patients affected by viral interstitial pneumonia as a result of SARS-CoV-2. The orthopaedic unit has been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The diagnostic and therapeutic paths to be taken for these patients with fractures in the pandemic emergency setting have been organized as follows: surgical treatment within 24 hours in an attempt to stabilize the patient, reduction of blood loss, and improvement of respiratory function with the goal of minimizing the need for admittance to the intensive-care unit. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.",

Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants who were included in the study. Nineteen patients with an average age of 85 years (range, 74 to 90 years) were admitted to the emergency orthopaedic room for the treatment of a proximal femoral fracture; the fractures were classified as OTA/AO 4 type 31-A1 (8 fractures; 2020 42.1%), 31-A2 (5 fractures; 26.3%), 31-B2 (5 fractures; 26.3%), or 31-B33 (1 fracture; 5.3%) 5 . Three patients had no history of fever or respiratory symptoms and were excluded from the study. Sixteen patients had reported fever and shortness of breath 3 to 7 days before hospitalization, and all had accidentally fallen at home with no signs of head injury. All 16 patients presented with symptoms of fever and oxygen desaturation on ambient air; 14 of them needed respiratory support. Clinical features, comorbidities, and the type of assisted ventilation administered at the time of hospitalization for symptomatic patients are shown in Table I . All patients were tested with thoracic computed tomography (CT) screening and oropharyngeal swabs (Fig. 1) . The 3 asymptomatic patients with no signs of interstitial pneumonia on the CT scan and no requirement for ventilatory support were promptly transferred to a clinic close to our hospital (Humanitas Gavazzeni, Bergamo, Italy), to which patients are usually assigned for sameday procedures or relief hospitalization, to await the result of the swab test before treatment. Sixteen patients with a positive result for interstitial pneumonia or related respiratory symptoms on CT scanning were hospitalized in our unit, and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), standard hydration, hydroxychloroquine (200 mg \u00b7 2 per day), and azythromycin (500 mg \u00b7 2 per day) was administered according to our hospital's protocol for patients with COVID-19. Three patients died on the wards, before surgery, as a result of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome (MOFS). For the other 13 patients, as per the recommendations of the anesthesiologists and trauma team, the criteria for surgery were a peripheral oxygen saturation (pO 2 ) of >90% and a body temperature of <38\u00b0C. Ten patients were operatively treated on the first day, 12 to 24 hours after admission. Three patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after recovery. Ac-cording to our usual clinical practice, all patients received regional anesthesia, a combination of neuraxial anesthesia and a peripheral femoral block to avoid any type of sedation. We performed reduction and osteosynthesis with an intramedullary nail (Gamma3; Stryker) for lateral femoral neck fractures (Fig. 2) and with an endoprosthesis (Corail; DePuy Synthes) for medial femoral neck fractures, with an average operative time of 30 and 50 minutes, respectively. All patients were encouraged to assume the sitting position on a wheelchair or armchair on the first day postoperatively, and they were assisted by physiotherapists to improve physiological ventilation. Postoperative pain management was based on a non-opioid multimodal strategy, and blood loss was minimized by avoiding fluid overload and managing patients who had hemoglobin values of \u00a39 g/dL with concentrated red blood-cell transfusion.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a new pandemic disease that has spread rapidly in northern Italy since the first Italian case in the country was isolated on February 20, 2020 6 . According to data provided by the Minister of Public Health of Italy, at the end of March 2020, >80,000 people had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with >36,000 cases being in the region of Lombardy 7 . Our city of Bergamo and its metropolitan area still have the highest number of infections, with >9,000 cases. Rapid saturation of intensive-care units and the associated demand for additional space is still the most challenging problem faced by hospital coordination units. Since the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the region of Lombardy, our hospital promptly restructured paths of assistance to maximize hospitalization for patients with COVID-19. Our Orthopaedic and Traumatology Unit has suspended elective surgery. In accordance with the anesthesiology team, we created 2 management pathways for trauma cases. All trauma patients in the orthopaedic emergency room (ER) were screened with thoracic CT scans and oropha-ryngeal swabs. Patients with no recent history (>3 weeks) of fever or upper respiratory tract symptoms and CT scans that were not suggestive of interstitial pneumonia were transferred to a clinic close to our hospital (Humanitas Gavazzeni of Bergamo). We believe that locating a clean spot to hospitalize trauma patients who test negative for infection may help to reduce the risk of contamination. Instead of a hospital, we selected a clinic close to our center. Patients sent to this clinic were initially isolated in a room until the results of the oropharyngeal swab were obtained and confirmed that they were COVID-19-negative. We did not find any positive swabs in asymptomatic patients with negative thoracic CT scans, and all negative cases were treated urgently. Patients with COVID-19-suggestive symptoms (including fever, headache, rough cough, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and positive CT thoracic scan for interstitial pneumonia) were hospitalized in our unit.",

Of those patients, 24.5% had 2 comorbidities and 51.7% had \u20213 preexisting diseases 8 . Beyond ethical dilemmas, our main concern during our emergency was to reformulate pathways of assistance, ensuring \"COVID-free\" paths for elderly patients in need of orthopaedic surgery and establishing operability criteria for vulnerable elderly patients affected by COVID-19 (Fig. 3) . The orthopaedic literature has confirmed that the advantages of early treatment of proximal femoral fractures in the elderly include promoting early movement, reducing bed rest, achieving better quality of life, controlling pain, and preventing blood loss and overall mortality 9 . However, severe pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency may represent a contraindication to anesthetic and surgical procedures because of the associated high risk 10 . We decided, as per recommendations of our anesthesiology team, to proceed with early surgery in patients with a pO 2 of >90% and a body temperature of <38\u00b0C. Spinal anesthesia was used for all patients in order to avoid any type of sedation and was combined with a peripheral femoral nerve block to decrease opioid consumption and to achieve better pain management in the postoperative period 11, 12 .",
