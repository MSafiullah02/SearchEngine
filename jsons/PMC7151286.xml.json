In Brazil more than 350\u2032000 dengue cumulative cases have been reported since starting of this year. Therefore, it is important to consider this region as primed for these infections: Reconvalescent people keep some level of immunity as memory Cytotoxic CD8+ T and or antibody producing Plasma B cells. Moreover, it has been shown that cross immunity is active in Flavivirus infections [2]. Even though the coronaviruses belong to another family, they may conserve some immunogenic epitopes. In murine models, prior immunity to distinct Flavivirus can somehow be protective to secondary challenges with other counterparts. In humans it is controversial if this cross immunity is beneficial or not. In the current outbreak it is difficult to analyze whether those levels of anti-Flavivirus antibodies and/or specific T-cells could cause a more severe or a mild disease. One way to address this question will be with cross-sectional studies comparing prevalence of antibody titers against many of those infections, with anti-SARS-CoV2, and also disease severity in different populations.",

It has been long known that in murine models Type I response is counterbalanced and inhibited by Type II response which is more directed against helminths. It was recently demonstrated in a murine model that the efficacy of vaccination against seasonal flu is impaired by concomitant helminth infection in an IL-10 dependent manner. Helminthic infection induced Type I regulatory (Tr1) cells that somehow impairs the efficacy of influenza vaccination, and even when the infection was cleared, the vaccination efficacy was not restored [3]. Thus, it is evidence that helminthic infections can influence how the immunity against virus infection is acquired. Considering the heterogeneity of the Brazilian population, this might influence mostly the poor populations infected who lack basic sanitation and proper nutrition.",

But BCG has another important effect which has been demonstrated in the last years by many clinical studies, that is a heterologous protection against non-related infections. Recent works have demonstrated that BCG might induce secretion of specific cytokines resulting in activation of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells [4]. Another proposed mechanism is to induce a more active innate immune response through several epigenetic modifications in IL-6 and TNFA genes, and activation of human monocytes that can protect against a non-related viral infection mediated by IL-1\u03b2 [5]. BCG vaccination could be an important factor also to protect health professionals against SARS-CoV2 infection.",

During the current outbreak, like SARS-CoV1 outbreak, children infected have very low or no symptoms, and only very few cases of severe disease or even death. It is not clear yet, by which mechanism a younger immune system can faster control virus replication and barely cause a disease. Murine studies correlated a better SARS-CoV1 clearance with more T and B cells clones available to control the infection. While old mice have lost crucial clones to control viral replication and therefore are more susceptible to more severe disease. On the other hand, it was shown that old lungs have a less inflammatory environment in order to control inflammatory conditions such as asthma and allergies, and therefore this could create a more susceptible environment for the present virus proliferation [6].",
