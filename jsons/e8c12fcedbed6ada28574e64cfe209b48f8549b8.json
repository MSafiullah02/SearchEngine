Recommendations for pre-transplant screening of organ recipients and donors for latent or active viral infections have been issued and are included in routine pre-transplant care [2] . This screening aims to identify donors with infections that would disqualify them for donation or require prophylactic strategies in the recipient. The most common example for the latter is cytomegalovirus (CMV), where transmission is considered an acceptable risk, if prevention strategies are in place. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) has been associated with post-transplant complications causing polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN), which increases the risk of allograft failure in 1-15% of transplant recipients [3, 4] .",

Analyses of the virome thus far have focused solely on the kidney transplant recipients [9, 10] . Urinary tract infections of kidney transplant recipients with BKPyV and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) were associated with complications occurring after transplantation [9, [11] [12] [13] . Whether these viruses were reactivated from latency under immunosuppressive therapy or were transferred from donor to recipient has not been resolved. In 1 study, identical BKPyV genome sequences in donors and recipients indicated transmission via the graft [14] .",

We identified 2 additional cases of JCPyVpositive donor-recipient pairs (tvy653, ume111) and 1 case of JCPyV detection that was only in the donor (sjp926). BKPyV was detected in the urine of 4 recipients (Supplementary Table 3A ). To define whether JCPyV in recipients is due to transmission from the donor or to latent reactivation, we constructed consensus sequences of the JCPyV isolates in donors and recipients. For this purpose, candidate samples from subset 2 were sequenced as well (Supplementary Table 2 ). Full genome coverage was achieved in all cases, except for jns976, where only between 25% and 80% of the genome was covered (Supplementary Figure 4) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed a tight clustering of JCPyV sequences in donor-recipient pairs in 6 out of 7 cases (Figure 3 ), implying that, in these cases, JCPyV infection was contracted from the donor. In the remaining pair (jns976), despite lower coverage, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that more distinct strains infected donor and recipient. Of note, recipient jns976 was already positive for JCPyV at the time of transplantation (Figure 2 ).",

This is in line with previous reports [23] and the seroprevalence of 80% among the 60 individuals in this cohort. Nevertheless, prior immune responses did not prevent nor rule out transmission (super infection) during transplantation, especially in kidney transplantation as the organ of JCPyV persistence. In 1 patient (jns976), the JCPyV sequences of the donor and recipient did not cluster. Here, we initially suspected a recent infection of the recipient, as the individual was IgG negative at the time of transplant but, at the same time, JCPyV reads could be detected, which has been reported before in cases of primary JCPyV infection in kidney transplant patients [22, 24, 25] . Surprisingly, the patient was already IgG positive before transplantation, as well as 1 year thereafter, while IgG levels were undetectable around the time of transplantation. IgM levels were undetectable at all time points. The reasons for these observations remain unclear.

Several studies reported the detection of the virus in the urine of kidney transplant recipients [9, 27] . In the context of immunosuppressed individuals, JCPyV has been associated with 2 clinical entities: that is, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and PyVAN [28] . However, in contrast to BKPyV, JCPyV has been rarely observed as a causative pathogen for PyVAN [22, 29] . Different results have been stated in the literature regarding JCPyV viruria and its impact on transplant outcomes. On the one hand, JCPyV urinary shedding was associated with reduced creatinine clearance in kidney and liver transplant patients, and might therefore play a role in renal dysfunction [30] . On the other hand, the finding of JCPyV viruria was shown to correlate with a favorable clinical course, especially if detected early [25] . Interestingly, Cheng et al reported better graft survival and lower rejection rates in kidney recipients with JCPyV viruria [31] . Also, in our study, clinically and on renal function, no impact was seen. In studies with larger numbers, longer periods of observation and, presumably, in deceased donor kidney transplantation, the relevance might be higher.",

Considering the detection of genetically-identical JCPyV isolates in 6 corresponding kidney donor and recipient pairs, our results strongly underline that transmission from donor to recipient must be considered also for JCPyV. Of note, while JCPyV was detected in the urine of transplant recipients, no detectable deterioration of renal function parameters occurred, suggesting an asymptomatic replication. Further studies will be needed to define whether JCPyV is only excreted from the transplanted kidney, or also disseminates and replicates in the recipient. Considering that we only detected JCPyV in the urine, a restriction to dissemination (eg, through preexisting immunity) needs to be considered.",

We did not detect any significant differences in estimated glomerular filtration rates (Supplementary Figure 3A) and protein/creatinine ratios (Supplementary Figure 3B) between transplant recipients with or without JCPyV infection. DISCUSSION Here, we studied the viral metagenomes of living kidney transplant donors and their corresponding recipients. The analysis of a first subset of 14 patient pairs by our open metagenomic approach identified JCPyV in the urine samples of 6 donors and BKPyV, JCPyV, HPV, and TTV replication in the urine samples of 9 recipients, which were confirmed by specific PCR. PCR screening of a second subset for the same viruses identified JCPyV in the urine samples of 3 donors, with 2 additional cases of JCPyV replication in donors and corresponding recipients. The presence of JCPyV in the urine of kidney donors at the time of transplant and in the corresponding kidney recipients 4-6 or 52 weeks after transplantation strongly suggested transmission of JCPyV via the graft. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed a transmission in 6 of 9 positive donors to the recipient, despite the seropositive immune status of the recipient. Only 1 additional recipient developed JC viruria, supporting the importance of donor-derived JCPyV infection in living donor kidney transplantation.",
