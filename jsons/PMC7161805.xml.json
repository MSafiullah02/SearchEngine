However, since the vast majority (>99%) of [3H]\u2010palmitate is incorporated into lipids, only a tiny amount remains for the labelling of acylated proteins. As a consequence, after SDS\u2010PAGE of samples, the resulting fluorograms usually have to be exposed for weeks to detect a signal, especially if the acylated protein is not abundantly expressed in the cell under study (Veit et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Recently, a method called acyl\u2013biotin exchange has been developed that allows identifying palmitoylated proteins within a few days of experimental work. The method is based on the exchange of the cysteine\u2010bound fatty acid with a derivative of biotin that specifically reacts with \u2013SH groups. In order to label only acylation sites, disulphide bonds must first be reduced and free \u2013SH groups need to be blocked chemically. Protein\u2010bound fatty acids are then removed with hydroxylamine, an agent that selectively cleaves thioester\u2010linked compounds (thus, fatty acids from S\u2010acylated proteins). The newly exposed free \u2013SH groups can then react with the biotin derivative, which can then be used to precipitate the acylated proteins using streptavidin beads. Samples not treated with hydroxylamine serve as negative control for the specificity of the reaction. Identification of precipitated proteins may be performed by high\u2010throughput tandem mass spectrometry (MS)\u2010based proteomics (Wan et al., 2007). The biotin\u2013streptavidin pull down can be replaced with the use of direct conjugation to thiol\u2010reactive sepharose resins (Forrester et al., 2011).",

The increase in the mass of an acylated protein compared with the unmodified protein is rather small (238 Da for palmitate and 266 Da for stearate); therefore, only short proteins can be accurately measured. In the case of viral spike proteins, only the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are subjected to the analysis. Purified virus particles are digested with specific proteases, which remove the ectodomain from the spike proteins, and the hydrophobic membrane\u2010anchoring fragments are then extracted from \u2018shaved\u2019 virus particles with chloroform/methanol and directly analysed by MS. Tandem MS sequencing of peptides can be used to identify the acylated cysteine residues (Kordyukova et al., 2004, 2008; Serebryakova et al., 2006).",

Cysteine residues with a similar intramolecular location have also been determined as palmitoylation sites for numerous cellular transmembrane proteins, mostly receptors and downstream effector proteins involved in important signal transduction pathways at the cell surface (Charollais and Van Der Goot, 2009; Smotrys and Linder, 2004). If a cysteine is too deeply embedded in the membrane bilayer, such as a transmembrane cysteine present in H7\u2010subype HA, it is not acylated (Veit et al., 1991), probably because it cannot be reached by a putative acyltransferase. An exception might be fusion of measles virus, where a cysteine present in the middle of the transmembrane segment is apparently more strongly acylated than cytoplasmic cysteines (Caballero et al., 1998). Likewise, attachment of palmitate is abolished if a cysteine is moved too far away from the TMR into the cytoplasmic tail (Yang and Compans, 1996, Yik and Weigel, 2002). However, such unusual palmitoylation sites are present in Env of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (but not in the spike glycoproteins of other retroviruses). In Env, the two acylated cysteines are located more than 50 and 130 amino acids downstream from the TMR. Since the acylation sites are in the vicinity of amphipathic regions, it was proposed that this part of the cytoplasmic tail folds back to the membrane and is anchored by insertion of the fatty acid into the membrane bilayer (Yang et al., 1995).",

However, only a few studies have shown (by MS) that each potentially palmitoylated cysteine residue is indeed stoichiometrically acylated (Kordyukova et al., 2008, 2010). However, for most proteins where palmitoylation was assessed by metabolic labelling, all (or most) cysteines had to be deleted to obtain a completely non\u2010acylated molecule (Liao et al., 2006; McBride and Machamer, 2010; Steinhauer et al., 1991; Veit et al., 1991). This indicates that all (or most) potential sites are used. Assuming that all nine cysteines of the S\u2010protein are acylated, the trimeric spike of CoVs contains 27 fatty acid molecules in its cytoplasmic tail. This substantial amount of hydrophobic moieties attached to a small part of the molecule is very likely to profoundly alter the protein's conformation and biophysical properties, and hence its ability to interact with membranes.",

This is in contrast to other hydrophobic modifications, such as N\u2010terminal myristoylation and isoprenylation (Resh, 2004a). In the neighbourhood of acylated cysteines, there are often hydrophobic and basic amino acids, but such residues are typical components of this region of membrane proteins. It was initially hypothesized that a transmembrane protein is acylated whenever a cysteine is present in the inner leaflet of the TMR or in the cytoplasmic tail (Veit et al., 1991). However, introducing a cysteine at various positions into the non\u2010acylated fusion protein of Sendai virus does not automatically lead to palmitoylation, indicating that other constraints exist, such as masking of potential acylation sites within the three\u2010dimensional protein structure (Ponimaskin and Schmidt, 1998). Nevertheless, a viral transmembrane protein with one or several cysteine residues located between the TMR and the cytoplasmic tail is a likely substrate for palmitoylation.",

Surprisingly, only one viral protein, UL 11, of herpes virus contains another hydrophobic moiety (myristate) in addition to palmitate, but a search for viral sequences with a cysteine residue in the vicinity of either an N\u2010terminal myristoylation signal (MGXXXS/T) or a C\u2010terminal CAAX\u2010box might reveal further peripheral membrane proteins likely to be palmitoylated.",

Such questions have been studied with influenza virus HA, which is considered as a model system for glycoproteins in general. The polypeptide chain of the transmembrane protein HA is synthesised on membrane\u2010bound ribosomes and translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where signal peptide cleavage, N\u2010linked glycosylation, folding and disulphide\u2010bond formation occur. Post\u2010translationally but still in the ER, three HA molecules assemble to a trimer, which is the rate\u2010limiting step for transport out of the ER. Trimming of HA\u2010linked carbohydrates occurs in medial Golgi cisternae, and terminal glycosylation in the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN). Also in the TGN, HA proteins with polybasic cleavage sites are split into the membrane\u2010spanning HA2 and the large N\u2010terminal HA1 subunits by the cellular endoprotease furin. HA is then transported to the plasma membrane and incorporated into virus particles during the budding process (Whittaker, 2001). Most other viral spike proteins discussed in this review follow the same pathway of processing and transport to the cell surface.",

For other viral glycoproteins, which are cleaved at a polybasic site by enzymes in the TGN, it has been described that it is the uncleaved precursor molecule that is the substrate for palmitoylation (Yang et al., 1995). For the core protein of HCV, an early compartment of the exocytic pathway can be inferred as acylation site from the fact that the protein is retained at specific locations of the ER connected to lipid droplets, the budding sites of these viruses (Majeau et al., 2009). The virus particle travels through the exocytic pathway in order to be secreted by the cell, and the glycoproteins are subject to post\u2010translational modification of their ectodomains, but palmitoylation of the endodomain is unlikely to occur at this stage, since it is shielded inside the virus particle.

It is known from the study of various cellular proteins involved in signal transduction that targeting can occur by (i) co\u2010translational attachment of myristate to an N\u2010terminal glycine residues, (ii) attachment of isoprenoids to a C\u2010terminal CAAX\u2010box or (iii) by stretch of basic amino acids located in the vicinity of the acylation site.

These studies revealed that influenza B virus HA possessing two cytoplasmic cysteines contains palmitate, whereas HEF of influenza C virus having one transmembrane cysteine is stearoylated. HAs of influenza A virus having one transmembrane and two cytoplasmic cysteines contain both palmitate and stearate, but the latter is exclusively attached to the cysteine positioned in the TMR of HA (Kordyukova et al., 2008). We also report that G of VSV contains palmitate at a cytoplasmic cysteine, whereas fusion of Newcastle Disease virus and E1 of SFV are acylated with stearate at a transmembrane cysteine (Kordyukova et al., 2010). Thus, site\u2010specific attachment of palmitate or stearate is a common feature of viral spike proteins and the location of the acylated cysteine relative to the transmembrane span might be the main molecular signal controlling attachment of specific carbon chains. However, individual amino acids in the vicinity of the transmembrane cysteine or other structural factors might affect fatty acid selection, since different influenza virus HA subtypes containing acylated cysteines at the same position differ moderately in the amount of attached stearate (12\u201335%) (Kordyukova et al., 2008, 2011).",

However, fatty acids which differ by only two methylene groups, such as myristate (C14) and palmitate (C16), show a significant difference in their hydrophobicity, which has a profound effect on the affinity of the acylated peptide for lipids. Although myristate barely contributes enough hydrophobicity for membrane partitioning of a protein, a single palmitoyl chain promotes efficient membrane binding (Peitzsch and McLaughlin, 1993; Shahinian and Silvius, 1995). In addition, the length of a covalently attached acyl chain might also influence the strength of protein\u2013protein interactions. The \u03b1\u2010subunit of the photoreceptor G\u2010protein transducin is heterogenously acylated at its N\u2010terminus with laurate (C12) or myristate (C14), and the \u03b1\u2010subunits containing the latter interact more strongly with the \u03b2/\u03b3 subunit (Kokame et al., 1992). However, it is difficult to imagine how stearate attached right to the beginning of the TMR might affect interactions of the cytoplasmic tail with either lipids or other proteins, for example internal components of virus particles. Figure 2 and the final paragraph describes a speculation how stearate might associate with amino acids in the TMR of HA, an interaction that might be important for the raft localisation of HA.",

Note that most DHHC proteins are located at the ER and the Golgi apparatus (Ohno et al., 2006), the intracellular site of viral spike protein acylation. One can imagine that the active site of a DHHC protein with a preference for stearoyl\u2010CoA might penetrate deeper into the membrane to attach stearate to a transmembrane cysteine compared with an enzyme with specificity for palmitoyl\u2010CoA. Such an enzyme would not recognise amino acids in the vicinity of the acylation site, but rather its position in the interior of a lipid bilayer. However, this notion has not been confirmed experimentally for viral glycoproteins. Hence, much work remains to be done to fully delineate the mechanism of palmitoylation of viral proteins.",

Global profiling of protein palmitoylation revealed that palmitoylation is a stable event for the majority of cellular proteins and that only a subset of proteins is dynamically palmitoylated, especially those that are involved in cell growth, migration and cancer (Martin et al., 2012). Depalmitoylation, which has a kinetic range from seconds to several minutes, occurs on all membranes of the vesicular pathway (Rocks et al., 2010) and is mediated by a cytosolic enzyme, acyl\u2010protein thioesterase (APT) (Duncan and Gilman, 1998). Acylation cycles may mediate shuttling of peripheral membrane proteins between compartments. The activity of APT releases these proteins from membranes (Dekker et al., 2010). Depalmitoylated proteins then rapidly diffuse to the Golgi where they are again palmitoylated and distributed by the vesicular pathway to their site of action (Rocks et al., 2010). Furthermore, the activity of some transmembrane receptors has been shown to be regulated by the acylation status (Linder and Deschenes, 2007). In contrast to the diversity of DHHC proteins, there are only two APT isoforms (Tomatis et al., 2010), which are expressed in most mammalian cell type examined. Substrate recognition features of APT and its regulation have not been established and hence the likelihood of depalmitoylation of a protein cannot be predicted.",

The subsequent budding process needs at least one protein which physically drives the curvature of membranes to generate a bud and another (or the same) protein that mediates the scission of the enveloped virus particle from the membrane. Membrane bending and scission are often achieved by cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, which are recruited by a viral protein to the budding site. The contribution of ESCRT is however limited to some virus families, most prominently retroviruses (such as HIV). Conversely, influenza virus buds independently of ESCRT proteins, and no involvement of ESCRT proteins has been reported for CoVs and togaviruses, the two other virus families where protein palmitoylation is known to affect virus budding (Chen and Lamb, 2008).

In cell culture, recombinant viruses where the acylated cysteine in M2 (or in CM2 of influenza C virus) has been replaced grow similarly well as the corresponding wild\u2010type virus (Castrucci et al., 1997; Muraki et al., 2011), even if acylation is deleted simultaneously with the second raft\u2010targeting signal, the cholesterol\u2010binding CRAC motif (Thaa et al., 2012). Moreover, there are natural virus strains that lack the acylation site in M2 (Thaa et al., 2012). Thus, acylation of M2 is neither required nor beneficial for virus replication in cell culture.

This indicates that there is a more complex influence of M2 in the context of the infected host that is not accounted for in cell culture experiments. Moreover, it is likely that budding of virus particles is a redundant process, that is other proteins can take over the function of a partially defective M2 protein.

Direct evidence that palmitoylation of HA is involved in virus release was obtained for HA of subtype H3 (Chen et al., 2005). Virus particles containing HA without either one of the two\u2010palmitoylated cytoplasmic cysteines revealed defects in virus release and incorporated reduced amounts of the internal components NP and M1. Importantly, exchange of the M1 protein by that of a different influenza virus restored assembly of viruses with non\u2010palmitoylated HA. This observation links palmitoylation of HA to the matrix protein M1, but amino acids in the latter that might be required for binding to the cytoplasmic tail of HA could not be identified. However, similar experiments with H7\u2010subtype HA did not reveal a defect in virus budding, but in virus entry by membrane fusion (see below) (Wagner et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the cumulative evidence just described indicates that the cytoplasmic tail of HA plays an important role in virus budding, and it is hard to imagine that the fatty acids do not affect the conformation of the very short cytoplasmic tail (11 amino acids) and hence its interaction with internal components of virus particles (see Figure 3).",

Blocking palmitoylation of S of MHV using a pharmacological approach reduced incorporation of S into virus particles and abolished its interaction with the M protein (Thorp et al., 2006). Interestingly, removal of only some palmitoylated cysteine residues had no effect, suggesting that not every fatty acid binding site is required for association with M (Thorp et al., 2006).

A second conformational change then bends the HA molecule, thereby drawing the fusion peptide towards the TMR. This leads to close apposition of both lipid bilayers. Since many other viral fusion proteins, for example S of CoVs, the fusion protein of paramyxoviruses and Env of HIV, have a similar structure as influenza HA in their post\u2010fusion conformation, it was suggested that they cause apposition of membranes by a similar mechanism (Earp et al., 2005; Skehel and Wiley, 2000).",

In contrast, non\u2010acylated HA mutants from the H1, H7, another HA from H2 subtype and from influenza B virus show impaired fusion pore or syncytium formation (Naeve and Williams, 1990; Sakai et al., 2002; Ujike et al., 2004; Wagner et al., 2005). These data might be seen as an indication that the function of the fatty acids depends on the HA subtype or variant to which they are attached. It might be that different HAs execute the final merger of membranes differentially and that acylation contributes only to one of these fusion mechanisms. Alternatively, the discrepancies might be due to the experimental setup, since the methods used to measure fusion are not ideally suited for this purpose. The fusion activity of HA depends on its density on the cell surface (Bentz and Mittal, 2003). This can hardly be measured accurately and barely controlled in expression systems; it is hence conceivable that a defect in fusion might be masked by over\u2010expression of HA. An experimental fusion system composed of closely controlled amounts of purified viral fusion protein (with or without fatty acids) reconstituted into lipid vesicles with the authentic composition of the viral envelope and fluorescently labelled liposomes as the target membrane would be helpful to quantitatively analyse the contribution of protein\u2010linked fatty acids to fusion pore formation and its widening.",

The position of the most C\u2010terminal cysteine is strictly conserved; the positions of the other two or three cysteines are sometimes shifted by one or more amino acids, but are strictly conserved within an HA subtype ([Veit and Schmidt, 2006] and Andrei Alexeevski, Lomonosov Moscow State University, personal communication). Thus, assuming these cysteine residues (and the attached fatty acids) would not play an essential role for the life cycle of influenza viruses, it is hard to conceive why they have not been exchanged by similar amino acids during evolution of influenza viruses. Indeed, it was not possible to generate influenza virus mutants with more than one HA palmitoylation site removed, which implies that this modification is essential for virus growth (Wagner et al., 2005; Zurcher et al., 1994).",

The cysteines located at the beginning of the cytoplasmic tail of S from both SARS and MHV have a stronger effect than those located in the distal part of the cytoplasmic tail (Petit et al., 2007; Thorp et al., 2006). A more detailed study on the various steps of membrane fusion was reported for S of MHV. S with deleted acylation sites is especially sensitive to inhibitory peptides that bind only to folding intermediates of the fusion process, implying that refolding of S to the post\u2010fusion conformation is delayed (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009).

The steps where palmitoylation of HA and/or M2 plays a role are depicted in blue. Details of these events are pictured in the right part of the figure. The red arrows in the lower part show the location of the fatty acids during membrane fusion. Driven by the conformational change of HA, they might perturb the organisation of the membrane lipids to allow for completion of membrane fusion. Fatty acids mediate localisation of HA to membrane rafts and might be required for the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of HA with M1, an internal component of virus particles. The fatty acid attached to M2 (in concert with a cholesterol\u2010binding site) is believed to target the protein to the edge of rafts, where M2 causes scission of assembled virus particles. Similar functions are envisaged for acylated membrane proteins from other virus families.\n",
