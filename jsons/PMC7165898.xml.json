The concept and model of innate immune sensing was first proposed by Charles Janeway Jr. who predicted that there must exist a group of innate immune receptors responsible for recognition and sensing of non\u2010self from self, and triggering subsequent adaptive immunity 1. Later studies confirmed his prediction and more and more innate immune receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been found since then.",

These PRRs recognize and sense a variety of PAMPs from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which range from lipoproteins, carbohydrates, lipopolysaccharide to nucleic acids. PRRs also recognize endogenous damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from host, which is related with both homeostasis and autoimmune diseases. Upon sensing of PAMPs or DAMPs, the PRRs trigger intracellular cell signaling, leading to transcriptional activation and expression of cytokines, chemokines, MHC, and co\u2010stimulatory molecules. Additionally, PRR triggered cell signaling induces several transcription\u2010independent cell processes such as phagocytosis, autophagy, cell death, and inflammasome/cytokine processing, which work together with the transcriptional innate responses 2.",

Different from non\u2010pathogens, the pathogens including viruses and intracellular bacteria replicate in cells, and nucleic acids RNA or DNA represent the signature of pathogens in particular of viruses which accumulate large amount of nucleic acids during replication in cells. All the nucleic acid detecting PRRs are localized intracellularly. For example, DNA sensing PRRs are endosomal TLR9, cytosolic AIM2, IFI16, and cGAS; RNA sensing PRRs are endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and cytosolic RIG\u2010I, MDA5, NLRP3, and NOD2. RNA PRRs play more important roles than DNA PRRs in recognition of RNA virus infections and initiation of protective immune responses. RNA viruses exhibit rapid replication kinetics, high mutation rates, and complex evolutionary dynamics, thus RNA viruses pose unique challenges to human and animal health 5. Most severe disease causing viruses are RNA viruses, such as ebola virus, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), foot\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV), etc. Therefore, investigation and understanding of RNA PRRs are critical for control of virus infections and protection of host.

Currently human and mouse have 10 and 12 TLRs, respectively: both human and mouse have TLR1\u20109; in addition, human has TLR10 whereas mouse has TLR11\u201013 6. All TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins and comprised of N\u2010terminal ectodomain or extracellular domain (ECD), middle transmembrane domain (TM) and C\u2010terminal cytoplasmic Toll/IL\u20101 receptor (TIR) domain (Supporting Information Fig. 1). The ECD contains 20\u201326 leucine rich repeats (LRR) motifs, which are juxtaposed into a horseshoe\u2010shaped solenoid or a ring\u2010like structure. The \u03b1\u2010helix of each LRR is located on the convex surface of solenoid structure, and \u03b2\u2010sheet of each LRR assembles and forms into the concave surface of the solenoid structure. Different from other LRR containing proteins, TLRs bind their ligands including agonists on the lateral convex surface instead of concave surface 7. The formation of M\u2010shaped dimer or multimer is needed for all TLR activation, so that the C\u2010terminal regions of the two TLR ECDs are brought into proximity. It in turn causes the multimerization of cytoplasmic TIR domains, which will recruit downstream adaptors TRIF or MyD88 through homotypic interaction, further forming signaling complex called signalosome and activating downstream transcription factors: one is NF\u2010\u03baB that induces proinflammtory cytokines, another is interferon regulatory factor (IRF) that induces anti\u2010viral type I Interferon (IFN) 6.",

The downstream adaptor TRIF is recruited by activated TLR3 through homotypic interaction, which further forms TRIF signaling complex involving other signaling components, such as TRAF6, TRAF3, TBK1, IKK\u03b5, and IKK.

TLR7 and TLR8 are very similar in terms of ligand recognition and intracellular signaling. Both are activated by small molecular agonists and GU or U rich single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA) (Fig. 1). Small molecular compounds Resiquimod (R848) and CL097 are agonists for both TLR7 and TLR8; however, Imiquimod (R837) and Loxoribine only for TLR7, and CL075 (3M002) only for TLR8. In addition, TLR7 and TLR8 may also recognize short dsRNA such as siRNA from RNA interference (RNAi), and some miRNA such as miRNA\u201021 and miRNA\u201029a secreted by tumor cells 13. The ECDs of TLR7 and TLR8 both have 26 LRR motifs that are more than those of TLR1\u20106; additionally there are several insertions including the one between LRR14 and LRR15 called undefined region or Z\u2010loop, therefore, the ECDs are larger and exhibit the ring\u2010like crystal structures 14. The TLR8 and TLR7 at endosome are proteolytically cleaved along the Z\u2010loop by cathepsins and arginine endopeptidase; nevertheless, the two cleaved fragments are still stuck together by multiple intermolecular interactions, and both are required for receptor's activation 15, 16. The Z\u2010loop cleavage is necessary for TLR8/7 dimerization which is essential for activation 17. Newly recent crystal structures showed that there are dual agonist binding sites in both TLR7 and TLR8 dimers 18, 19: one is located within dimer interfaces which binds small chemical agonists or degrade products of ssRNA agonists; another is located on the concave surface of the TLR horseshoe structures and for binding of ssRNA oligonucleotides. The first sites are enough for small chemical agonist induced TLR7 and TLR8 activation, whereas both sites are necessary for ssRNA induced TLR7 and TLR8 activation. At steady state, TLR7 and TLR8 exist as dimers; upon binding to agonists, the conformation of dimers change such that the cytoplasmic TIR domains multimerize and recruit downstream adaptor MyD88 through homotypic interaction. The signaling complex called Myddosome is formed involving IRAK4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TRAF3 and downstream transcription factors NF\u2010\u03baB and IRF7 are activated to induce proinflammatory cytokines and IFNs, respectively.",

NOD2 receptors are found mostly in macrophages, monocytes, paneth intestinal cells, and dendritic cells 37. Additional studies suggested that NOD2 plays an important role in the restriction of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), likely through the recognition of virus RNA and subsequent IFN induction 38, 39 (Table 1). Similar to RLRs, NOD2 has N\u2010terminal 2CARDs, and may tetramerize into washer\u2010locker structure to initiate the adaptor MAVS aggregation and downstream IFN production 38, 40 (Fig. 1).

Once activated by RNA, TLR13 recruits adaptor MyD88 to trigger transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB activation and induce proinflammtory cytokine production 22. Mouse TLR13 was reported to recognize a conserved CGGAAAGACC motif in Staphylococcus aureus 23S rRNA and E. coli 23S rRNA 41, 42. Furthermore, TLR13 also recognizes Streptococcus pyogenes\n43. In addition to RLRs RIG\u2010I and MDA5, there exists a group of non\u2010RLR RNA helicases which mediate cytosolic RNA recognition and signaling. These are DDX3, DHX9, DHX33, DDX60, and DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 30, 44. DDX3 binds poly I:C or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RNA, associates with RLR\u2010MAVS signaling complex, and enhances IFN response. DHX9 is expressed in mouse spleen dendritic cells and mouse bone marrow dendritic cells, recognizes poly I:C, influenza virus and reovirus RNA, binds with MAVS activating downstream signaling. DHX33 binds poly I:C and reovirus RNA, activates MAVS mediated signaling or NLRP3 mediated inflammasome. DDX60 can be induced by the virus infection, and in the meantime binds the virus RNA, further binds RIG\u2010I, MDA5, and LGP2, enhancing RLR signaling and downstream IFN response. DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 are expressed in myeloid dendritic cells, in which DDX1 binds poly I:C through helicase domain, whereas DHX36 and DDX21 bind TRIF TIR domain through their HA2\u2010DUF and PRK domain, respectively. The complex enhances IFN response and exhibits inhibitory effect to influenza virus and reovirus infections. The third minor RNA PRR, leucine\u2010rich repeat flightless\u2010interacting protein 1 (LRRFIP1) was reported to bind both RNA and DNA and be involved in the recognition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Listeria monocytogene, activate \u03b2\u2010catenin, which then translocates into nucleus and promotes IRF3 transcription activity and IFN production 45.",

Likewise, there are interactions between different RNA PRRs and mutual influence of different RNA PRR signaling. Understanding of the enormous complexity of these processes helps provide insights into in vivo innate immune activation. Within the RNA sensing TLRs, synergistic effects were observed between TLR3 and TLR8 in monocyte\u2010derived macrophages and DCs 49, 50; In contrast, TLR8 inhibits TLR7 signaling in both human and mice 51, 52. Between three subfamilies of RNA PRRs, TLR7/8 cooperates with NOD2 in DC activation and results in a synergistic release of pro\u2010inflammatory mediators which promote the activation of Th17 cells 53. RLRs suppress the gene transcription of IL\u201012p40 induced by the activation of Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) including TLR3 and subsequent TLR3 induced Th1 and Th17 responses 47. Furthermore, RLR RIG\u2010I cross\u2010interferes with NOD2 in regulating downstream signaling by direct interaction with each other 54. The interactions between different PRRs need to be considered in the contexts of distinct species, various cell types, and different agonists used for stimulation.",

We give some examples here: First, based on the ligand recognitions and activation mechanisms of RNA PRRs, RNA varieties and small\u2010molecular agonists of higher potency can be developed for either direct anti\u2010viral therapy or effective viral vaccine adjuvants. Similarly, elucidation of the RNA PRR triggered cell signaling pathways will potentially lead to the discovery of novel innate immune modulators with higher anti\u2010viral efficacy. Second, for certain virus infections, only the RNA PRRs involved in the viral recognition will likely play an important role in the anti\u2010viral immune response; in this case, knowledge of the virus recognition by RNA PRRs becomes critical. Third, TLR3, 7, 8 are primarily expressed by macrophages and DCs and recognize viral RNA within the endosomal compartment, whereas RLRs (RIG\u2010I, MDA5) and NLRs (NLRP3, NOD2) are ubiquitously expressed and sense viral RNA within the cytoplasm of infected cells (Table 1). Therefore, it should be considered how to deliver the RNA PRR agonists to host to maximize the anti\u2010viral immune response, such as delivery routes, with or without transfection etc. Fourth, as seen in Table 1, TLRs have general positive cross\u2010talks with NLRs, whereas RLRs have negative cross\u2010talks with TLRs and NLRs. Even though information is incomplete, this knowledge of cross\u2010talks between different RNA PRRs will provide a rationale to develop appropriate combinations of various agonists/modulators to control viruses which are simultaneously recognized in vivo by several RNA PRRs. With the information becoming complete, and additional knowledge on how the RNA PRR signaling influences downstream adaptive immune response, more and more effective therapeutics or vaccine adjuvants to control virus infections will be on the horizon.",
