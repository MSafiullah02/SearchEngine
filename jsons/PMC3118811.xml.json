HBoV is classified in the family Parvoviridae, which includes small non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with 5.3 kb single-stranded DNA genome containing three open reading frames (ORFs). The first two sequential ORFs encode non-structural proteins NS1 and NP-1, whereas the third downstream ORF encodes two viral capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2 [1]. HBoV circulates worldwide [2] and more recent phylogenetic analyses revealed that three novel HBoV species, different from the respiratory HBoV1, named HBoV2, 3 and 4, are frequently detected in stools from children with acute gastroenteritis [3], [4], [5], [6].",

The most frequent clinical diagnoses associated with respiratory HBoV are general upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchitis and exacerbation of asthma [2]. Symptoms associated with HBoV usually last 1\u20132 weeks [11], [12], but the agent has also been detected in association with prolonged fever [13]. An association of HBoV with respiratory disease has been based mostly on the significantly higher frequencies of detection of the agent in ARI patients than in control subjects without respiratory symptoms [8], [10], [14]. HBoV is also detected in feces from children with diarrhea with frequencies ranging from 0.8% to 9% [6], [15], [16]. In addition, HBoV DNA has been detected in tonsil tissue in children with chronic tonsillitis undergoing surgical resection [17], [18].",

Moreover, no experimental animal model of HBoV infection has been developed, which hampers fulfillment of Koch's postulates for a definitive association of HBoV with disease. This scenario is further complicated by the possibility that HBoV may persist in a way similar to other viruses of the family Parvoviridae\n[20], with consequent prolonged detection in human secretions. In addition, detection of HBoV DNA by PCR is commonly associated with detection of genomes of other viruses whose roles in pathogenesis of human diseases is already established [21].",

The overall frequency of HBoV detection was 10.0% in 2005 and 3.0% both in 2006 and 2007, with monthly rates that did not indicate consistent seasonality (Figure 1). It was noticeable that HBoV circulated roughly along with HRSV (Figure 1). In this 3-year study period, there was a trend for an increase in the total number of respiratory samples from children submitted for viral testing, HRSV and HBoV positivity, in association with dry season and declining average montly temperatures [22].",

In order to confirm this hypothesis, an assay was developed to detect HBoV VP1 mRNA in NPAs by real time RT-PCR done on total RNA extracts previously treated with DNAse I. As an internal control, real time RT-PCR was done for the housekeeping gene of \u03b2-actin. When simultaneously positive for both HBoV VP1 and \u03b2-actin mRNAs, this assay was considered a marker of active HBoV replication. Positivity for HBoV VP1 or \u03b2-actin by PCR done directly on DNAse-treated material without previous reverse transcription were considered indicative of remaining genomic DNA after incomplete DNAse treatment, and samples were discarded. Of the 48 samples positive for HBoV, 40 had sufficient remaining volume left for testing. Of those, only 10 (25.0%) tested positive for VP1 mRNA and, remarkably, 9 of these had very high HBoV loads of greater than 108 copies of DNA/mL. The median HBoV viral load in patients shedding VP1 mRNA was 8.85 \u00d7 109 copies/mL, which was significantly higher than that in patients negative for VP1 HBoV mRNA, 3.82 \u00d7105 copies/mL (p<0.01) (Figure 2b, Table 3).

A few previous studies conducted in the region reported HBoV infection rates of 6.0% to 10.7% in patients with ARI [9], [25], [26], [27] and in 2.0% of patients with gastroenteritis [15]. Importantly, the present study revealed a significantly higher rate of concurrent diarrhea in patients with ARI positive for HBoV as compared to those with ARI but without detectable HBoV, suggesting a causative role for HBoV in gastrointestinal manifestations observed in ARI patients. In general, parvoviruses replicate more efficiently in tissues with high cellular turnover, such as respiratory and digestive epithelia [28]. Several members of the family Parvoviridae are known to cause gastroenteritis, such as canine parvovirus (CPV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine minute virus (CnMV). In addition studies previously published by others have reported HBoV detection in stools from patients with gastroenteritis [29]. Although the mechanisms of pathogenesis and routes of infection of HBoV are not yet understood, some information is available for bovine parvovirus (BPV), another member of the genus Bocavirus. BPV causes respiratory and enteric diseases in calves following initial replication in the tonsils and intestinal epithelium, from where it spreads into the blood, lymphoid tissues and respiratory epithelium. BPV induces atrophy of microvilli in the small intestine and death (by apoptosis and necrosis) of lymphoid cells and ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium [28].",

This was similar to the 75% reported by Allander et al., in Sweden [10], and higher than the 50% reported by Esposito et al., in Italy [34]. While viral co-infections have long been recognized in ARI studies, the advent of highly sensitive PCR assays magnified their observation. In the particular case of HBoV, frequencies of co-infections have consistently been reported to be higher than those observed for other respiratory infections, reaching rates similar to those reported for HAdV [35], a tendency confirmed by the present study. Yet unproven, this may suggest that long term shedding of HBoV DNA, unrelated to current illness may regularly occur, as it is known to happen with HAdV [36]. Indeed, HBoV DNA was found by PCR in lymphocytes from palatine tonsils of 32% of children undergoing tonsillectomy [18], suggesting that this virus can establish latent or persistent infection in pharyngeal lymphoid tissue.",

The results revealed HBoV viral loads to be significantly higher in patients without other viral co-infections than in those with multiple viruses detected. Moreover, rates of diarrhea were significantly higher in patients with very high HBoV viral loads in their NPAs. Such finding, in the absence of respiratory viral co-infections, suggests a causal role for HBoV in the genesis of the diseases presented by these patients. Nevertheless, detection of a direct evidence of active replication of HBoV in the secretions from patients was required to strengthen the causality link between the virus and disease. In order to do that, an assay to detect HBoV VP1 mRNA by real time RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples was developed. Production of VP1 mRNA is unequivocal evidence of HBoV replication, but its shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions does not indicate the possible sources of virus production. Because RNA is very highly unstable in ribonuclease-rich respiratory secretions, one can speculate that VP1 mRNA more likely originates from disruption of sloughed whole HBoV-infected epithelial cells directly into the RNase-inhibiting extraction reagent. Unfortunately, preparation of cytology slides that would have enabled detection of HBoV on sloughed cells by in situ hybridization was not possible given the nature of the study.",

Conversely, in the absence of a marker of current viral replication, HBoV was also often detected in nasopharyngeal secretions, but in much lower viral loads and frequently associated with shedding of other pathogenic respiratory viruses. It should be pointed out that VP1 mRNA was found only in 25% of the HBoV infected ARI patients, with a significant part of whom with diarrhea. This may be interpreted to mean that only one quarter of the HBoV respiratory infections are associated with genuinely acute viral replication, likely involving the gastrointestinal tract.

The study included all samples from patients with symptoms of ARI seen at any of the hospital clinics and wards, submitted to the virology laboratory for testing. The vast majority of the samples had been originally sent to the laboratory for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza screening and no exclusion criteria were applied. Clinical information obtained retrospectively from patient records upon discharge was entered on study forms. Clinical data collected included the presence of wheezing, cough, fever, sneezing, dyspnea, coryza, nasal obstruction, diarrhea, requirement for oxygen therapy and length of hospitalization. NPAs were collected in saline solution from all patients [9] and sent on ice to the virology laboratory within four hours. In addition to the 1015 samples from ARI patients, a convenience set of 50 control samples from patients without any respiratory symptoms who were participants in a previous study [23] were used as negative controls. This group consisted of 26 males, with median age of 19.5 months, mean of 37 months (SD  = 44 months). After routine virology sample processing, remaining samples were split into backup aliquots, including two in Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA), which were kept in storage at \u221270\u00b0C [9]. This study was approved by the Internal Review Board of the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (HCFMRP-USP) under approval number 4856/2004.

All PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels. PCR products of all tested viruses were cloned into the plasmid pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and used to determine detection limits for each assay. All clones were sequenced with BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. The detection limits for the PCR assays were determined by testing serial decimal dilutions of the clones, and results varied from 1 to 100 copies of plasmid DNA.

To ensure target-specific amplification total RNA extraction products were treated with DNAse I (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) 2 h prior to PCR. As a control, the same PCR was done in parallel directly with the RNA extraction product without previous RT. Samples were considered positive for HBoV VP1 mRNA only when they were simultaneously negative for amplification directly from the extracted RNA without previous RT. RT was performed on 1 \u00b5g of RNA extracted by Trizol using10 pmol of random primers, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.
