In the past there had been an agreement to the concept of \u2018growing the economy now and cleaning up the environment later,\u2019 thus, accepting the trade-off between economic and environmental welfares. However, the contemporary development policies tend to primarily focus on greening of the global production processes, particularly to curb the greenhouse emissions that stem from the predominant combustion of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is pertinent for the world economy to undergo a transition from use of non-renewable to renewable energy resources, keeping environmental sustainability into cognizance (Murshed 2018). In the same vein, the sustainable development goals (SDG) agenda of the United Nations has also called out for worldwide commitments to augment renewable energy (RE) resources into the global energy-mixes for ensuring energy security and environmental sustainability across the planet. The 7th of the seventeen SDG specifically stresses for substantially elevating the shares of renewables in the global energy consumption figures by the end of 2030 (Villavicencio Calzadilla and Mauger 2018). Therefore, the world economies have expressed their commitments with respect to the attainment the SDG within this stipulated time frame.",

            "text": "The benefits of enhancing the volumes of renewable energy consumption (REC) within the economy can embody multidimensional forms. For instance, incorporating RE technologies into the national energy policies worldwide is likely to complement the global energy security strategies which seem to be at risk due to the depletion of the global non-renewable energy (NRE) reserves (Valentine 2011). Thus, augmentation of RE into the global energy-mixes would not only relieve pressures off the world demand for fossil fuels, but it would also complement the NRE in significantly improving the overall reliability of energy supplies (Zemin 2008). Besides, REC can also exhibit a pivotal role in curbing the intensities of greenhouse emissions, therefore, attributing to improvements in the environmental quality while slowing down the climate change phenomenon in tandem (Perry et al. 2008). Boosting the consumption levels of RE has also been appropriately acknowledged in the 2015 Paris climate change conference to play a defining role in keeping the global temperature rise below the critical level of 2 \u00b0C per annum which is pertinent in combating the climate change adversities to a large extent.1 Among the other positive impacts, REC is hypothesized to reduce the vulnerability of economies against the exogenous volatility of crude oil supplies (Rentschler 2013), stabilize energy prices (Shen et al. 2010), enhance energy-use efficiency levels (Murshed 2019), expand electricity-access rates (Oseni 2012), attribute to rural electrification (Urmee et al. 2009), facilitate off-grid electrification (Sen and Bhattacharyya 2014) and also create job opportunities within the local community (Sari et al. 2008; Llera et al. 2013).",

Thus, technological redundancy, within the developing economies in particular, often upholds the substitution of fossil fuels via renewable alternatives. Besides, the underdeveloped energy infrastructure within these nations is also proclaimed to be one of the major hindrances bottlenecking their prospects of undergoing the renewable energy transition (RET) phenomenon (Murshed 2020). More importantly, implementation of the RET policies is relatively difficult in the context of net oil-importing countries (NOIC) courtesy of their acute vulnerability to exogenous shocks to the world crude oil prices (Gupta 2008). A particular reason behind this could be interpreted in terms of the predominant reliance of these nations on crude oil imports, mostly for domestic power generation purposes. In addition, inadequate natural RE endowments often compel these nations to rely on imported oils as well. Consequently, such monotonic fuel-dependency often restrains these economies from switching to RE use; thus, attributing to the adverse environmental complications stemming from the obligatory combustion of the imported oils. Besides, these economies are also referred to be highly susceptible to other multifaceted macroeconomic adversities, following the impulsive movements in world crude oil prices, as well (Cunado et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Moreover, the relatively higher startup costs of setting up the RE power plants, solar in particular, have also accounted for high renewable electricity prices within the NOIC, thus, deterring the RET phenomenon further. In comparison to the traditional oil-based power prices, the prices of electricity sourced from solar and wind energy in Britain are higher by more than two times (The Economist 2014). Moreover, the ideal locations of the renewable power plants are usually across regions far away from the cities which further inflate the associated power transmission and distribution costs. However, in recent times, the average cost of RE production has gone down to a large extent. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA 2019), the global weighted-average costs of solar power, between 2010 and 2018, have significantly declined to almost match the corresponding costs of generating electricity from the fossil fuels, oils in particular. More importantly, upon analyzing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE)2 in the context of electric power generated from both renewable and non-renewable sources, it is evident that renewable power prices have substantially reduced over time. For instance, within South Asia and the Pacific, the LCOE produced using solar power declined the most from being around 350 US dollars per megawatt in 2010 to 69 US dollars per megawatt by the end of 2019 while the LCOE for natural gas-fired electricity remained fairly stagnated at around 72 US dollar per megawatt (Harder 2019, August 1). Moreover, among the Asia Pacific economies, India currently accounts for the lowest cost of RE production whereby the nation\u2019s solar LCOE has dropped below the LCOE for power generated from coal (Wood Mackenzie 2019). Hence, taking the lower costs of RE generation, in recent times, into consideration, undergoing RET across the NOIC, in particular, can be expected to be a crucial energy policy intervention in simultaneously ensuring energy and environmental sustainability.",

            "text": "Against this background, this paper aims to probe into the dynamic impacts of world crude oil price shocks on the RET process across four major NOIC across South Asia namely Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The fact that all these nations have traditionally been vastly reliant on crude oil imports, investigation of the cross-price elasticity of RE demand becomes a pertinent topic of research, keeping South Asia\u2019s prospects of RET into consideration. Although existing studies have probed into the impacts of oil prices on REC using a linear framework, in the context of South Asia, the possible nonlinearity of the REC-crude oil price nexus is yet to be explored. It is germane to address the quadratic association between these variables from the notion that oil price movements may not be able to induce RET instantaneously, following the inability to undergo RET due to being a large share of their national outputs being generated using power sourced from the imported crude oils. Thus, REC in the initial stages can be expected to pretty inelastic to rising crude oil prices in the world market. However, alongside substantial economic development of these economies with time, the barriers to RE adoption could be expected to reduce whereby the elasticity of REC concerning further hikes in crude oil prices could be anticipated to improve to facilitate the RET process. This paper contributes to the literature in this regard by modeling the nonlinear association between REC and movements in the prices of crude oil. Addressing this nonlinearity is of relative significance in the context of NOIC since these economies are highly rigid to RET in the short-run following their extensive reliance on imported crude oils.",

            "text": "On the other hand, power prices have progressively gone up in the selected South Asian NOIC as well. Although such price hikes could partially be attributed to the overall growth of these economies, exerting demand-induced inflationary pressures on the electricity prices, the volatility of oil prices in the world market (Yasmeen et al. 2019) and acute shortages of the primary energy resources (Shakeel et al. 2016) have collectively driven up the price of electricity. In Bangladesh, the flat rate of electricity provided to the small industries increased from 4.02 Bangladeshi Takas per kilowatt-hour in 2007 to almost 8.20 Bangladeshi Takas per kilowatt-hour by the end of 2017 (BPDB 2017). Similar upward trends are also seen for prices of the residential, commercial, industrial electricity supplies. Likewise, the wholesale electricity price index of India surged from 102.40 in 2013 to 108.70 by the end of 2018, depicting a 6.15% growth in the electricity prices during the aforementioned period (OEA 2020). Moreover, between 2010 and 2014, the nation\u2019s agriculture, residential, industrial and commercial electricity price indices on average grew by 66%, 30%, 17% and 14%, respectively (OEA 2020). Similar trends are also evident in the context of Pakistan where the government has persistently raised the electricity prices to account for fuel cost adjustments (Times of Islamabad 2019, December 26). In contrast, average electricity prices in Sri Lanka have recently exhibited declining trends (Climatoscope 2019) which can plausibly be attributed to the nation\u2019s relatively less oil-dependency for electricity generation purposes among the selected South Asian NOIC. Hence, keeping the trends in low LCOE for renewable electricity production and the surging electricity prices in the majority of these economies into consideration, reducing oil-dependency could be ideal in limiting electricity prices while safeguarding the environment via facilitating the RET phenomenon across South Asia.",

Table 1 depicts the trends in REC between 1990 and 2018. As far as the employment of RE is concerned, Sri Lanka can be seen to head the list in terms of recording the highest per capita REC figures among the four South Asian economies. A particular reason behind this phenomenon could be attributed to the nation\u2019s indigenous biomass energy resources accounting for a dominant share of the aggregate primary energy consumption figures (Nissanka and Konaris 2010). In contrast, Bangladesh accounts for the lowest per capita REC levels. This can fundamentally be credited to the nation\u2019s insufficient natural endowments of primary RE supplies. Between 1990 and 2018, the per capita REC, in terms of kilograms of oil equivalent, in India and Sri Lanka rose on average by 8.33% and 18.91%, respectively, while that in Bangladesh and Pakistan declined, respectively, by 6.10% and 5.66%. It is also evident from Table 1 that all these four nations have performed miserably in improving the RE shares in their respective total final energy consumption levels. The average RE share of Bangladesh has gone down by almost 33 percentage points followed by India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan registering declines in their respective RE shares by 19.79, 18.45 and 8.75 percentage points. These adverse trends seem to portray ominous signals concerning the attainment of RET across South Asia. Hence, it is critically important to identify the factors inhibiting the consumption of renewables from policy perspectives.",

It is apparent from the graphs that the shares of renewable electricity in aggregate electricity output levels of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have declined, on average, between 1990 and 2015. Similar downward trends revealed in the context of Bangladesh over the 2005\u20132015 period. Bangladesh accounts for the lowest renewable electricity output shares among the four South Asian economies which can largely be credited to the nation\u2019s predominant reliance on indigenous natural gas and imported oils for power generation purposes. In contrast, Sri Lanka has traditionally been the forerunner in terms of registering the highest renewable electricity output shares. However, the nation\u2019s renewable electricity share has remarkably dropped by a staggering 51.37 percentage points, on average, between 1990 and 2015, while its reliance on imported oils for power generation purposes has significantly escalated in tandem. On the other hand, Pakistan has gradually accentuated its reliance on imported oils as perceived from a rise in the nation\u2019s share of electricity from oil, in the aggregate electricity outputs, by almost 17 percentage points, on average, between 1990 and 2015. Figure 4 also portrays heterogeneity across these economies concerning their respective national energy-mixes. It is evident that a major proportion of total electricity in Bangladesh and Pakistan is sourced from the combustion of the indigenous natural gas supplies, while India banks heavily on its coal resources to generate electricity. On the other hand, Sri Lanka produces a significant amount of its electricity outputs from the RE resources. However, all these nations still import a significant amount of crude oil for producing electricity which seems to be one of the prime factors attributing to South Asia\u2019s environmental hardships.",

The inverted-U shapes of the fitted lines, as shown in Fig. 1, portray the dependence of these nations on crude oil imports since rising crude oil prices are initially accompanied by lower RE shares which, after a threshold level of oil price, elevates the RE shares. Hence, these interesting trends further stress on the need to investigate the potential nonlinearity of the REC-crude oil price nexus in the context of the South Asian NOIC. Moreover, Fig. 5 in \u201cAppendix\u201d plots the historical trends in the RE shares, renewable electricity output shares and real crude oil prices between 1990 and 2015. It is apparent from the statistical trends that a persistent rise in the real oil prices has dampened both the shares of RE consumption and renewable electricity outputs in most of the selected South Asian NOIC. Hence, these trends seem to further highlight the extent of oil dependency among these nations which makes it is difficult for these nations to completely switch from consumption of oil to the RE alternatives. Among the selected South Asian NOIC, Bangladesh is referred to as the most oil-vulnerable nation, while India is said to be least vulnerable to oil price shocks (Mohsin et al. 2018).",

However, this paper confines the discussion to explaining the REC-oil price nexus using the SE stemming from a rise in crude oil prices. Several studies have referred to RE resources as substitutes for the NRE resources such as crude oil, coal and natural gas (Kruger 2006). Hence, assuming RE resources as a perfect substitute for fossil fuels, a rise in world crude oil prices is likely to induce a SE whereby the volume of REC can be anticipated to go up. Figure 2 illustrates the dynamics in this regard. Prior to the rise in the crude oil prices, across the world market, the optimum level of REC takes place at point A where the indifference curve (IC) is tangential to the slope of the budget constraint (BC0). The slope of this budget constraint is given by the relative price ratio of RE resources and crude oil (PRE0/POIL0). At point A, the optimum levels of REC and oil consumption are, respectively, shown as RE0 and OIL0. Now assuming that the price of crude oil, which is determined in the world market, goes up (from POIL0 to POIL1) while the price of renewables, which is locally determined, is assumed to stay put (at PRE0). Hence, the relative price ratio would decline resulting in the slope of the budget constraint being flatter. The new budget constraint can be shown as BC1 and the corresponding relative price ratio is given by PRE0/POIL1. Under such circumstances, there will be a movement along the indifference curve, from point A to point B, whereby the consumption of renewables can be expected to rise while oil consumption is likely to decline. The SE of the rise in world crude oil prices can, therefore, be shown as the increase in the levels of REC from RE0 to RE1 and the decrease in oil consumption levels from OIL0 to OIL1.",

In the case of these two variables not being perfect substitutes, the SE could be negligible whereby the impact of rising crude oil prices on the level of REC may not be as pronounced. Under more adverse scenarios, in which the RET is not possible due to certain macroeconomic limitations, particularly in the form of predominant oil-dependencies, rising crude oil prices may even foster higher consumption of crude oils to meet the aggravating demand for energy to produce the national outputs. As a consequence, the share of NRE in aggregate energy consumption levels can be anticipated to rise along with the rise in crude oil prices. Hence, it can be said that the exact nature of the REC-crude oil price nexus depends on the possibility of the substitution between the NRE and RE resources and also on the extent of crude oil-dependency of the concerned economy.",

However, the results also showed that REC is pretty elastic to changes in oil prices across Germany, the UK and the USA while for France, Italy, Canada and Japan evidence of an inelastic association between REC and oil price movements was ascertained.

The results advocated in favor of the long-run cointegrating associations between per capita REC and real oil prices.

The results from the fully modified ordinary least square technique indicated that REC per capita is positively influenced by rising real oil prices, thus, referring to RE resources as alternative sources of energy to fossil fuels. A 1% rise in the real price of oil was found to be accompanied by a 0.37% escalation in the per capita REC figures, on average ceteris paribus. Hence, these findings suggested that REC in the context of the concerned South American economies is inelastic to changes in world oil prices. Moreover, the causality estimates from the vector error-correction model approach discovered bidirectional short-run causation between per capita REC and real oil prices. However, in the long-run real oil price was found to causally impact the per capita REC figures without the feedback.",

Moreover, considering country-specific features, a great deal of heterogeneity concerning the nature of the REC-oil price nexus is also evident. More importantly, the existing literature has overlooked the possible nonlinearity between these variables which could be effective in reasoning the ineffectiveness of higher crude oil prices in instigating the RET phenomenon, particularly from the perspectives of the NOIC. This paper attempts to address this gap in the literature by modeling the REC-crude oil price relationship in a nonlinear framework in the context of the four NOIC across South Asia.",

Economic growth can be anticipated to exert a positive impact on the REC figures via empowering the concerned nations to overcome the limitations restraining the RET phenomenon (Murshed 2020). Also, RGDP is interacted with ROILP and included in the model to account for the joint impacts of economic growth and crude oil price shocks on the movements in the REC levels. The rationale behind the inclusion of this interaction term could be explained in the sense that as an economy, particularly the one that is a net importer of crude oil, experiences growth it can gradually lessen its dependence on the oil imports which, in turn, can be expected to elevate its REC levels. In the same vein, the econometric model is also controlled for the imported oil-dependency, abbreviated by DEPEND, within the selected South Asian economies. Following Damette and Marques (2019), imported oil-dependency is proxied by the share of energy imports in the total merchandize imports figures of the respective economies. A rise in the share of energy imports in aggregate merchandise import figures can be interpreted as a simultaneous increment in the degree of oil-dependency which, in turn, can be associated with lower REC within the economies.",

The variable CO2 stands for the volume of carbon-dioxide emissions measured in terms of kg per 2010 US dollars\u2019 worth of GDP. It is pertinent to include carbon-dioxide emissions in modeling the trends in REC since rising apprehensions regarding the air-pollution induced climate change adversities are likely to facilitate the substitution effect between the consumption of fossil fuels and the renewable alternatives (Omri and Nguyen 2014). Finally, TO denotes the trade openness index, measured in terms of the sum of imports and exports as a percentage of the GDP. The relevance of considering openness to trade for modeling the REC trends can be justified in the sense that a rise in the trade openness indices can be interpreted as a reduction in the trade barriers which can be anticipated to facilitate cross-border flows of renewable power, thus, boosting the REC levels (Murshed 2018).",

Although the conventionally used panel data estimation techniques namely the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) are claimed to be able to handle the cross-sectional correlations among the panels, such methods overlook the slope heterogeneity issues by inappropriately assuming the existence of the homogeneous slope coefficients across all the cross-sections.

This allows for the possible heterogeneity of the slope coefficients across the different cross-sections to overcome the inefficiencies of the FMOLS and the DOLS techniques.

Thus, the common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimator, proposed by Pesaran (2006), is tapped which is a cross-sectionally augmented version of the MG estimator to handle the CD issues as well. The CCEMG corrects the limitations of the MG estimator by incorporating the time-variant unobserved common factors stemming from the CD issues into the estimation process via augmenting these unobserved common factors into the regression model before estimating the individual slope coefficients for each of the cross-sections and then averaging them across the panel units.

The newly developed Dumitrescu-Hurlin (DH) panel causality estimation technique developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) is applied in this paper. Application of the conventionally used Granger (1969) causality test is inappropriate following the slope heterogeneity issues in the data since this technique assumes the slopes to be homogeneous across the cross-sectional units. The Granger (1969) causality test statistic is estimated under the null hypothesis that causality does not exist between a pair of stationary variables belonging to all the cross-sections, against the alternative hypothesis of causality existing between these variables homogenously across all the cross-sections. In contrast, the DH causality technique allows for heterogeneity across the cross-sections to estimate the z-bar statistics using the null hypothesis that causality does not exist between a pair of stationary variables in all the cross-sections, referred to as the homogenous non-causality (HNC) null hypothesis, against the non-homogenous alternative hypothesis of causality existing between these variables in at least one of the cross-sections.

Hence, in the context of model (1), it can be said that REC across all the four South Asian economies has long-run associations with real crude oil prices and other macroeconomic aggregates controlled for in the empirical modeling. The results coincide with the findings by Apergis and Payne (2015) in which the authors too found a long-run association between per capita REC and real oil prices in the context of 11 South American economies. Similarly, in the context of model (2), it can also be asserted that there are long-run associations between the shares of RE in aggregate final energy consumption figures and crude oil prices and all the other control variables for all the four South Asian economies. Finally, the statistical significance of the test statistics in the context of model (3) also provides statistical validity regarding long-run associations between the renewable electricity share in aggregate electricity outputs and the other independent variables. Thus, the confirmation of the long-run associations calls for further investigation of the long-run conditional elasticities between the concerned variables.",

Based on the elasticity estimates, the threshold level of real crude oil price is predicted to be around 135 US dollars per barrel in constant 2016 prices.4 The corresponding elasticity estimates show that, beyond this predicted real crude oil price threshold, a further rise in the real price of crude oil by 1% is accompanied by increments in the REC levels by 0.10\u20130.14%, on average, ceteris paribus. Therefore, it can be asserted that initially following a rise in crude oil prices the substitution of the imported crude oils via the RE alternatives, within the selected South Asian nations, may not be possible due to the predominant reliance of these nations on oil imports to source energy for generating their respective national outputs. A particular reason behind such imported oil-dependence can largely be attributed to the unavailability of indigenous natural oil endowments across South Asia. This, coupled with the limited opportunities to locally generate power from renewables in most of the selected South Asian countries, tends to restrain the RET process in the short-run. However, a persistent small rise in crude oil prices, approaching toward the predicted threshold, along with economic development over time would induce the RET phenomenon in these economies which possibly could be due to the gradual phasing out of the imported-oil dependencies of these economies over time. This mechanism can be explained using the estimated economic growth elasticities of REC. The positive signs of the statistically significant elasticity parameters attached to lnRGDP suggest economic growth does exhibit favorable impacts to facilitate RET within the economies which could be playing a key role in reducing their imported-oil dependencies. Moreover, the positive signs of the statistically significant elasticity parameters attached to the interaction term further advocate in favor of the joint favorable impacts of economic growth and rising crude oil prices concerning the facilitation REC within the four South Asian nations.5 Furthermore, dependency on imported oils is also found to dampen the prospects of RET across South Asia. The negative signs of the statistically significant elasticity parameters attached to lnDEPEND denote that a 1% rise in the volume of energy imports leads to a fall in the REC levels on average by 0.17\u20130.24%, ceteris paribus. Thus, reducing oil imports, which can be said to be synonymous with a reduction in imported-energy dependencies, is key to boosting REC within the South Asian countries. This finding is similar to the conclusion made by Damette and Marques (2019) for 24 European Union economies.",

The positive CO2-REC nexus is parallel to the findings by Sadorsky (2009) in the context of the G7 countries. On the other hand, the regression results also imply that liberalizing trade barriers generate favorable outcomes concerning the facilitation of the RET phenomenon within the selected economies.

The results show that a 1% rise in real crude oil prices initially curbs the shares of renewables by 0.61\u20130.99% on average, ceteris paribus. The small magnitudes of the predicted elasticities imply that the share of renewables in aggregate final energy consumption figures is pretty inelastic to changes in crude oil prices.

However, the negative signs of the elasticity parameters attached to both lnROILP and lnROILP2 explicitly point out the fact that rising crude oil prices do not stimulate the transition from non-renewable to renewable primary energy use for electricity generation purposes in the selected NOIC across South Asia. This is a pretty concerning finding in the context of energy security within these nations. However, it is to be noted that the magnitudes of the estimated elasticities of the parameters attached to lnROILP2 are relatively lower, and less than one, in comparison to the predicted elasticities of the parameters attached to lnROILP. This implies that as the real price of crude oil increases to a large extent, its dampening impact on renewable electricity shares seems to gradually diminish. Hence, it can be expected that at extremely high crude oil prices, the marginal negative impact on the renewable electricity share can be anticipated to be completely phased out which, in turn, could go on to raise the share in the future.",

The importance of transitioning from consumption of non-renewable to RE resources is of greater relevance in the context of the NOIC since predominant dependency on imported oils often goes on to bottleneck their prospects of RET. Against this milieu, this paper attempted to investigate the impacts of exogenous shocks to the real crude oil prices on the RET phenomenon within four net oil-importing South Asian economies namely Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The overall results from the econometric analyses provided statistical validity regarding the nonlinear U-shaped association between crude oil price and REC. Based on the estimates, the threshold level of real crude oil price was estimated to be around 135 US dollars per barrel which is way above the real crude oil price level of 45 US dollars per barrel in 2018. Therefore, the estimated threshold implies that the real price of crude oils has to increase by almost three-fold in order to induce higher REC levels within these economies. This is a crucial finding since it partially explains the possible reason behind the existing imported-oil dependency amidst the selected South Asian NOIC. Moreover, following the ongoing Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic, the price of crude oil is on the verge of going negative due to a stern fall in the global crude oil demand (Widdershoven 2020, May 03). Under such circumstances, the degree of oil-dependency amidst the selected South Asian NOIC can be anticipated to surge which, in turn, could adversely impact the environmental quality within these economies further. Although the results from the empirical analysis implicated that the current real price of oil is way below the predicted threshold level, and the difference can be expected to widen particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it is pertinent for the concerned economies to drift away from their predominant dependence on the imported oils for power generation purposes and undergo RET for the sake of establishing environmental well-being at the earliest.",

For instance, these economies can look forward to importing hydroelectric power from Nepal while importing geothermal energy from Bhutan.
