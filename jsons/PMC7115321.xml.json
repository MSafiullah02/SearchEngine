Prior to SARS, it was already understood that the ability of HCWs to adhere to infection control guidelines varied substantially and was often less than ideal. For example, a recent study of 3 US hospitals over 3 years founds that HCWs wore appropriate respiratory protection with tuberculosis patients 44% to 97% of the time.4 Similarly, compliance with universal precautions for blood and body fluids (BBF) has been shown to range from 16% to 44%.5, 6, 7 During the SARS outbreaks of 2003, the implementation of basic infection control procedures appeared effective in controlling the outbreaks in most circumstances8, 9, 10; however, in other situations, HCWs became infected despite apparent adherence to recommended guidelines.11 Clearly, factors other than individual knowledge and motivation must be at work to give such variation in effectiveness.",

Enabling factors can refer to the environmental factors that block or promote self-protective behavior, including skills, knowledge, and availability and accessibility of PPE and other resources. Reinforcing factors involve the organizational factors, such as communication, training, performance feedback, social approval or disapproval from coworkers or management, and other safety climate dimensions. This model has previously been used to explain the variation of compliance with universal precautions to prevent exposures to bloodborne pathogens by HCWs.14 These factors can be seen to interact as shown in\nFig 1.",

Literature searches were conducted in 5 databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and OSHROM) for articles published in English in the last 15 years that related to infection control practices, occupational health and safety issues, and environmental factors and other issues of importance in protecting workers against infections in health care settings. This produced an initial list of 841 publications. From the initial literature search results, a series of research topics were developed under 3 broad categories: (1) basic science and efficacy of facial protective equipment, (2) the effectiveness of specific infection control procedures, and (3) organizational and individual factors that influence infection control and occupational health in health care settings.",

Secondary reference materials, derived from these initial references, were added.

This resulted in 168 publications being used in the final report. Drafts from each subgroup were merged, and the compiled version was reviewed by the team as a whole.

The majority of research conducted in this area has been exploring HCW compliance with universal precautions (UP). UP were introduced in the 1980s in response to the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens to HCWs from patients, in particular HIV, and now are more generally referred to standard precautions (in the United States) or routine practices (in Canada). Although the research does not directly examine the compliance of HCWs with protection from respiratory tract infections, the determinants of adherence to UP are likely applicable to many types of self-protective behavior.",

Actual working conditions resulting in overwork, lack of time with patients, and having to deal with emergencies were reported to have significant negative affects on compliance. HCWs are influenced by the subjective norm, ie, the perception of social expectation to adopt a given behavior.51 This suggests that, if HCW believe that key persons in their work and social environment expect them to be compliant with the use of PPE, they are more likely to do so.",

For example, workload issues are thought to affect HCW willingness to comply with recommendations for PPE use. Workers who feel stressed and overloaded at work are much less likely to be attendant to safety needs and precautions.23 Helfgott et al found that knowledge of how to prevent occupational exposure did not appear to correlate with compliance with UP.41 The most common reasons why HCWs in this study did not comply were time constraints, interference with performing specific tasks, and lack of risk-based information to assist HCWs in identifying infectious patients. It was also noteworthy that this study also found that level of compliance was inversely proportional to level of experience of the HCW. Osborne determined that mean compliance rates among Australian operating room nurses were 55.6% with always double gloving during surgical procedures and 92% with always wearing adequate eye protection.52 The variable that had the most influence on compliance was the perception of barriers to compliance, specifically, that adhering to UP interfered with duties. Nickell et al found in their study of 2001 HCWs during the SARS outbreak in Toronto that the most commonly cited difficulty with complying with precautionary measures, especially masks, was that wearing one for any extended period of time was very uncomfortable.53\n",

Other diseases, such as tuberculosis, are thought to be easily controlled through the use of specific environmental controls and PPE.61 Improving the safety climate and creating a workplace culture in which workers and their health are valued has the added potential benefit of improving HCW outcomes for many different diseases and injuries, including emerging diseases of which preexisting immunity is not present.

Some attitudes such as the use of PPE interfering with patient interactions and the discomfort associated with PPE use may not change until less obtrusive and more comfortable equipment is developed.
