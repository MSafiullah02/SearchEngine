            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) emerged in Europe and in the US in the early 1990s and has since become a problem to the swine industry worldwide. PRRSV causes a persistent and sometimes severe disease that is characterized by respiratory problems, weight loss and poor growth performance, as well as reproductive failure in pregnant sows (Rossow, 1998, Zimmerman et al., 1997). Measures to regulate the disease have been complicated by the pattern of persistent, subclinical infection with occasional epidemic outbreaks as well as the high heterogeneity of the virus and the failure of the antibody response to completely protect against viral re-infection and re-emergence (Batista et al., 2004, Blaha, 2000, Meng, 2000, Murtaugh et al., 2002).",

PRRSV is divided into two genotypes, the European, or type 1 virus, also known as Lelystad virus (LV), and the American, or type 2 virus (Meng et al., 1995a). There is considerable sequence variability within both groups and only about 50\u201360% sequence identity between the two subtypes (Allende et al., 1999, Fang et al., 2007, Forsberg, 2005, Nelsen et al., 1999). Both subtypes now have a worldwide distribution (Fang et al., 2007, Gao et al., 2004, Nam et al., 2009, Ropp et al., 2004, Stadejek et al., 2002).",

Occasionally, a 20\u201330 nm diameter core could be discerned, but no further structural details could be established from these studies. Recently, structures of the virion and some of the viral proteins, obtained by electron microscopy (EM) and X-ray crystallography, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies of protein\u2013protein interactions have led to an improved understanding of PRRSV structure, assembly and infection process and shed light on the structural relationships between different nidoviruses.",

At the N-terminus of pp1a are the two proteins NSP1\u03b1 and NSP1\u03b2, which each includes a papain-like cysteine protease domain, called PCP\u03b1 and PCP\u03b2, respectively. NSP1\u03b1 and NSP1\u03b2 cleave themselves from the polyprotein at their C-terminal junctions (den Boon et al., 1995, Ropp et al., 2004).

            "text": "Expression of an NSP1\u03b1/\u03b2 fusion protein in Escherichia coli led to autocatalytic cleavage at the NSP1\u03b1/\u03b2 junction, which occurred after Met 180 in PRRSV XH-GD, a type 2 strain, equivalent to His 180 in LV (Sun et al., 2009). The structure of NSP1\u03b1 released upon such autocatalytic cleavage was determined crystallographically (Sun et al., 2009). The 180-residue protein exists as a dimer in solution and in the crystal. NSP1\u03b1 contains an N-terminal zinc finger domain (residue 1\u201355), followed by a papain-like protease domain (PCP\u03b1, 66\u2013166) and a short C-terminal extension (Fig. 1A). The zinc finger is a common motif in transcription factors, and may be responsible for the observed role of NSP1 in arterivirus RNA synthesis (Kroese et al., 2008, Tijms et al., 2007, Tijms et al., 2001, Tijms and Snijder, 2003). The protease domain has a typical papain-like fold with similarities to papain-like proteases from other viruses, including FMDV Lpro (Guarne et al., 1998). The active site is comprised of Cys 76 and His 146 and is stabilized by a zinc ion in the crystal (Sun et al., 2009). The C-terminal extension was bound to the active site in the crystal, where it forms the substrate for its own protease activity. The release of NSP1\u03b1 from the polyprotein thus enables subsequent processing by NSP1\u03b2 (den Boon et al., 1995, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). In EAV, PCP\u03b1 is not functional, due to a mutation of the active site Cys residue, and thus NSP1 is not cleaved into two separate entities (den Boon et al., 1995).",

It is the most variable non-structural protein, with only 32% identity between subtypes (Allende et al., 1999). (By comparison, NSP2 of EAV is considerably smaller, with only 571 residues.) NSP2 contains a papain-like protease domain (PL2) near its N-terminus (residues 47\u2013147), followed by a hypervariable region that is rich in prolines, a hydrophobic region containing four predicted TM helices, and a conserved C-terminal domain (Han et al., 2009). The PL2 protease activity is responsible for cleavage at the NSP2\u20133 junction (Han et al., 2009, Snijder et al., 1995). Residues Cys 55, Asp 89 and His 124 form the active site catalytic triad (Han et al., 2009). PL2 has deubiquitinating activity (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007) and may be equivalent to the papain-like protease domain (PLpro) of SARS-coronavirus, which is embedded in the NSP3 protein and acts as a deubiquitinase (Ratia et al., 2006). The cleavage specificity of the two proteins is similar, cleaving at GG pairs (Han et al., 2009). PRRSV PL2 is much smaller than the coronavirus protease and appears to be missing most of the \u03b2-sheet (the \u201cfingers\u201d domain) of PLpro, retaining the active site formed between helix \u03b14 and the \u03b2-sheet in the \u201cpalm\u201d domain (Ratia et al., 2006). The N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ub1) domain of SARS-CoV PLpro also appears to be missing from PRRSV PL2.",

The structures of NSP4 from both PRRSV and EAV have been solved crystallographically (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002, Tian et al., 2009). The two proteins are 34% identical in sequence and have a very similar structure. The protease domain of NSP4, residues 1\u2013153, has a canonical chymotrypsin-like fold consisting of two six-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrels (Fig. 1C). This fold is found in numerous RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, picornaviruses and alphaviruses, and is referred to as a 3C-like protease (3CLP) (Allaire et al., 1994, Choi et al., 1991, Snijder et al., 1996). The active site of PRRSV NSP4 is formed by residues Ser 118, His 39 and Asp 64, located in the cleft between the two \u03b2-barrel domains. (Other non-arteri nidoviruses use Cys instead of Ser in the active site, Snijder et al., 1996.) Residues 157\u2013199 comprise a C-terminal extension domain of a mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structure. While this domain is also very similar between PRRSV and EAV, it is shifted by about 8 \u00c5 in PRRSV relative to EAV when the chymotrypsin domains are superimposed (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002, Tian et al., 2009), but the functional relevance, if any, of this shift is unknown.",

M and GP5 are disulfide linked between Cys 9 of M and Cys 48 of GP5 (Cys 8 and Cys 50 in type 1 strains) (Dea et al., 2000, Mardassi et al., 1996, Wissink et al., 2005).",

Analysis of the PRRSV type 2 GP5 protein by TMHMM and HMMTOP predicts clearly only the last TM helix, between residues 107 and 125 (Fig. 2). A possible second TM helix is predicted between 63 and 82 in type 2 and, more strongly, between 68 and 90 in type 1. However, a second TM helix in this location would place the glycosylation sites of the ectodomain on the inside of the virus, an implausible arrangement. In EAV, where the ectodomain is much larger (about 100 residues), three TM helices are clearly predicted, thereby leaving the ectodomain on the outside of the virus where it belongs. While the evidence is not conclusive, this comparison suggests that three TM helices are present in PRRSV as well. In this case, the PRRSV GP5 ectodomain is only about 30 residues long, which would explain the very smooth appearance of PRRSV virions by EM (see below).",

(Note, however, that the term E was previously used for GP5.) E is a non-glycosylated, 70\u201373-residue minor envelope protein (Wu et al., 2001, Wu et al., 2005). The E protein of EAV was shown to be essential for EAV infectivity, but not for particle assembly (Snijder et al., 1999, Wieringa et al., 2004). E consists of a single predicted TM helix and is thought to form an oligomeric ion channel (Lee and Yoo, 2006)(Fig. 2). This protein is therefore most likely involved in the viral fusion and/or internalization process, by analogy with similar proteins found in many other viruses, such as the M2 protein of influenza virus (Pinto et al., 1992) or the 6K protein of alphaviruses (Melton et al., 2002).

The first TM helix is predicted to comprise a signal peptide in both PRRSV and EAV; however, studies in EAV have shown that this peptide is not cleaved off (Wierenga et al., 2002) suggesting that the protein is anchored in the membrane at both the N- and C-terminal ends.",

The most effective neutralizing antibodies to PRRSV were directed against GP5, suggesting that this protein may be the main determinant of protective immunity and might be involved in receptor binding (Gonin et al., 1999, Ostrowski et al., 2002, Pirzadeh and Dea, 1997, Weiland et al., 1999, Yang et al., 2000). However, GP5 does not appear to be responsible for defining tropism; swapping out the ectodomain of EAV GP5 with that of PRRSV or LDV did not affect the tropism of the virus (Dobbe et al., 2001). The same was also true for M (Verheije et al., 2002). Thus, cell tropism appears to be determined by a higher affinity binding of one or more of the minor envelope proteins to a cell-specific receptor protein (Wissink et al., 2004, Wissink et al., 2005, Wissink et al., 2003).",

Similarly, fusion of coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MHV require the action of endosomal cathepsins B and L (Qiu et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005). The target for this activity in PRRSV and thus the identity of the protein containing the fusion peptide is still unknown.

In the coronavirus N proteins, this 120\u2013130-residue domain is embedded into a much larger nucleocapsid protein of 350\u2013422 residues. This \u201cnidovirus nucleocapsid fold\u201d is different from the nucleocapsid structures of both flaviviruses (Dokland et al., 2004) and alphaviruses (Choi et al., 1997), showing that these three groups of (+) RNA viruses belong to distinct structural groups in spite of superficial structural similarities (Strauss and Strauss, 2002). The structural similarity between corona- and arteriviruses strongly suggests that these proteins evolved from a common ancestor, and reinforces the evolutionary relationships that are also reflected in their genome organization and replication strategy. In the coronaviruses, the much longer N-terminal RNA-binding domain also contains an ordered, \u03b2-rich domain that has been solved by NMR and X-ray crystallography (Fan et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2004, Jayaram et al., 2006). This domain has no equivalent in the arteriviruses.",

The MS2 coat protein has a fold that is related to the human histocompatibility antigen (HLA) peptide-binding domain (Saper et al., 1991). However, the MS2 and HLA structures have more extensive, four-stranded \u03b2-sheets and their long \u03b1-helices sequentially succeed rather than precede the sheet. The two \u03b12-helices of N would be equivalent to the helices that form the peptide-binding cleft in the HLA molecule and is exposed on the outside of the MS2 capsid. This superficial resemblance led to the suggestion that the PRRSV and EAV N proteins might be analogously organized into an icosahedral (T\n = 3) capsid with the \u03b1-helical cleft on the outside (Deshpande et al., 2007, Doan and Dokland, 2003). In the EAV-N\u039448 structure, the N dimers are organized into dimers of dimers, which seemed to support this idea (Deshpande et al., 2007).",

This was further supported by the observation that full-length PRRSV N denatured in urea, followed by renaturation in the presence of tRNA formed long filamentous structures with an inter-fiber spacing of 4 nm, consistent with the crystal packing, in addition to shell-like structures of various sizes (Doan and Dokland, 2003).

The lipid bilayer of the envelope is clearly discernible, and has a thickness of about 4.5 nm. This may include some contribution from the envelope protein endodomains, in particular M and GP5. For the MHV coronavirus, a thin layer corresponding to M endodomains could be distinguished from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer itself under appropriate imaging conditions, giving an apparent total membrane thickness of 7.8 nm (Barcena et al., 2009). In some places, the membrane has a set of cross-striations, which are assumed to correspond to envelope protein TM domains (Fig. 5B).",

In the central sections (Fig. 6B, third and bottom rows) it appears that each of the two layers of density in the core is comprised of a series of elongated densities of approximately 7 nm length, in many cases giving the appearance of a chain with a link-to-link distance of about 10 nm. One possible interpretation of this structure is that two layers of N dimers form a linked, twisted chain with the RNA in the middle, where it interacts with the N-terminal RNA-binding domains of N (Fig. 7\n).

Although it is not known exactly how the coronavirus N protein is organized into a helical nucleocapsid (Davies et al., 1981, Sturman et al., 1980), several possible models have been proposed (Chen et al., 2007, Fan et al., 2005, Jayaram et al., 2006). In some of these models, the RNA forms the center of a helix made by the N proteins, while others have proposed that the RNA is wound around the outside of a helical N protein core. However, these models were based on high-resolution structures of nucleocapsid proteins that lack most of the RNA-binding domain and do not contain RNA. Recent cryo-electron tomographic structure determination of the MHV coronavirus suggests that the RNA\u2013protein complex forms a helical coil, which in the micrographs gives rise to the appearance of a double-layered core similar to that observed for PRRSV (Barcena et al., 2009). While this interpretation would also be consistent with the PRRSV structure, the disordered appearance of the PRRSV core may suggest a more loosely organized nucleocapsid, rather than a helically symmetric coil. Nevertheless, this linear/helical core arrangement appears to be a general structural motif for the nidoviruses.",
