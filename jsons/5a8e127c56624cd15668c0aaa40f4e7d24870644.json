Children also present more frequently than adults with gastrointestinal symptoms, although persistent fever is reported, which is uncommon with other novel coronaviruses. 2, 5, 6 In the United Kingdom, Public Health England (PHE) have outlined a shielding strategy designed to protect those within the population deemed to be \"extremely vulnerable\" to COVID-19 infection. 7, 8 This includes individuals that are immunocompromised, have specific types of cancer, severe respiratory conditions and other rare diseases. For these groups, based on adult data, the recommendation is to remain isolated in their homes for several months, with significant impact on the individual and their families. Given the documented reduced overall severity reported in children with COVID-19, we examined a cohort of paediatric patients presenting to a specialist children's hospital with suspected COVID-19 to document their clinical behaviour and outcomes with particular regard to presence of underlying medical conditions leading to \"vulnerability\".

However, a striking feature of the data presented here is the finding that the overall proportion of patients considered vulnerable is not significantly increased in those with confirmed COVID-19 disease, compared to either those with similar presentations but testing negative, or indeed the underlying background prevalence of medical vulnerability conditions among these preselected patients. Furthermore, in those with confirmed COVID-19 disease, the proportion of patients with underlying vulnerable conditions requiring intensive care admission for mechanical ventilation and length of time admitted to intensive care were not increased. There were no deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. These data broadly suggest that, in contrast to the data from adults, the majority of underlying medical conditions do not appear to place children at significantly increased risk of either developing COVID-19 disease or experiencing severe symptoms and complications if infected. Recent data suggests that those adults who are immunocompromised, for example subsequent to renal transplantation, demonstrate increased severe complication rates with COVID-19 (28% mortality). 11 In contrast, a recent study reported no mortality in a multicenter cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis affected by COVID-19, 12 and therefore the susceptibility among vulnerable groups is likely to be both disease-specific and related to patient age. In the present study for example, for the majority of underlying conditions there was no difference between the groups, although children undergoing chemotherapy for paediatric malignancy were over-represented in the CoVPos group, suggesting these specific patients are at increased risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection. Further work is therefore required to elucidate the specific conditions associated with increased risk and their associations with age, since this will have significant implications for societal shielding and future strategies to manage lockdowns.",

Nevertheless, these data represent a relatively large series of children presenting with similar clinical features and as such provides important data regarding the disease severity of COVID-19 in children compared to other similar infectious conditions and the potential impact of underlying medical condition vulnerability in this population. In particular, the current policy of extended shielding for vulnerable patients of all ages, represents a significant burden for patients and their families in terms of social interactions, schooling and education and childhood mental health. These data suggest that the criteria for vulnerability derived from initial adult evidence may not be applicable to children to the same extent. Further large-scale data are urgently required to understand the implications of underlying disease for COVID-19 outcomes by age in order to develop rational and evidenced based policies for management of children with these conditions in relation to ongoing COVID-19 emergency policy and lockdown management. In summary, the findings of this study have reported on a cohort of patients presenting to a specialist children's hospital with clinical features suggestive of COVID-19 infection, in whomapproximately forty percent of cases tested positive for the disease. Compared to patients with similar presentation who tested negative, children with COVID-19 do not appear to be at significantly increased risk of severe complications and in particular, in the paediatric population, those with underlying vulnerable conditions do not appear to be greatly at risk of severe disease.
