[13] A notable exception to this is polyethyleneimine, a cationic polymer which reveals antiviral effects when derivatized with mannose [14] or hydrophobic alkyl side chains. [15] In turn, polyanionic polymers represent the largest class of materials that block viral adsorption and infection. Already in the 1960s, poly-methacrylic acid (PMAA) was shown to suppress the infectivity of enveloped vesicular stomatitis, sindbis, and vaccinia viruses. [16] [17] [18] In the past decades, especially with the advent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, several additional polyanionic polymers were described as antivirally active. Among these were sulphated polysaccharides and other sulphated polymers, polyphosphates, carbosilane dendrimers, or nucleic acid polymers, which inhibit a variety of enveloped viruses including HIV-1, HSV-1 and 2, or influenza virus. [19] [20] [21] The mechanism underlying virus inhibition is often a direct interaction of the polyanion with viral glycoproteins thereby preventing receptor engagement and fusion. [20, 22] Other modes of action are binding of polymers to cellular receptor(s), [20, 23] intracellular inhibition of viral polymerases, [23, 24] or suppression of viral budding.

To achieve this, we synthesized a library of 14 carboxylate, phosphate/phosphonate, and sulfonate polymers differing by anionic functionality and hydrophobicity. These novel polymers were applied against a panel of major viral pathogens, i.e., HIV-1 and HSV-2, as well as pseudoparticles that mimic infection by influenza, Rabies and Lyssa, SARS, Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola viruses. Major focus was set on ZIKV against which currently no drug or vaccine exists. We identified lead candidates with a broad-spectrum but also virus specific antiviral activity. Our results provide a clear suggestive view on what makes a virus susceptible to polymer-based inhibition, and independently, a detailed analysis of which structural characteristics of the polymer make it a superior inhibitor of viral infectivity.

In the \"cell treatment\" setting, uninfected target cells were incubated with the polymers prior to viral challenge to identify leads that inhibit viral infection and are active in complex cell culture medium containing fetal calf serum. For the \"virion treatment\" approach, polymers were preincubated with the virus to allow direct interaction between the polymers and then these mixtures were added to target cells resulting in a dilution of the polymer. This approach allows to identify compounds that directly interfere with viral infectivity and may be used as topical microbicides, [31] or in filtration devices for biomedicine and biotechnology to inactivate virus.

However, two polymers, poly(vinylbenzoic acid) (PVBzA) and poly(vinylbenzenesulfonate) (PSVBS), revealed anti-ZIKV activity and shared structural similarity, as these are rather hydrophobic carboxylate-and sulfonate-containing styrenic polymers. These data provide an early indication that the nature of the anionic charge (carboxylate, phosphate/phosphonate, sulfonate) is not decisive in the observed antiviral activity of the polymer.

The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of PSVBS was \u224814 mg L \u22121 in the \"cell treatment\" assay and 1.4 mg L \u22121 when exposed to virus, demonstrating a direct effect on the virion.

We first excluded cytotoxic effects of the polymers which may interfere with interpretation of results derived from the antiviral assays. We tested a panel of mammalian cells used as hosts for the diverse pathogens in this study: HeLa derived TZM-bl for HIV-1, BHK (ELVIS) cells for HSV-2, hepatic Huh-7, HEK293T, and Vero E6 cells for remaining viruses. Toxicity of polyanions was quantified in these cells up to 50 mg L \u22121 concentration of the polymers (TZM-bl, Huh7, ELVIS, and HEK293T), or 200 mg L \u22121 for Vero E6 cells, being the highest concentration of polymers used in respective experiments. Toxicity screening by MTT assay revealed that decrease in metabolic activity of the cells upon incubation with polymers was marginal ( Figure S6 , Supporting Information) and cannot account for antiviral effects described below. Inhibitory activity of the polymers was tested on HIV-1 infection using TZM-bl cells that express \u03b2-galactosidase upon viral infection. [38] In stark contrast to data obtained with ZIKV ( Figure 2 ), most polyanions suppressed HIV-1 infection to a level below 20% under both cell and virus treatment conditions ( Figure 6 ; Figure S7 of the Supporting Information). IC 50 values indicate that similar to ZIKV, \"virus treatment\" was typically superior to \"cell treatment\", which is most prominent for poly(3-sulfopropyl acrylate) (PSPA) and poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) ( Table 1 ). This observation reiterates that for polyanions, antiviral activity of the polymer is characterized with higher potency if the polymer is allowed to come into contact with the viral particles prior to being administered onto cells. For HIV-1, it appears that \"strength\" of the polyanions as known from polyelectrolyte complexation [39] is decisive and that the sulfur-containing polymers are most potent, with IC 50 values for \"virus treatment\" being on the order of only a few \u00b5g L \u22121 (Table 1) . Of note, other polyanionic polymers such as heparin, dextran sulfate, polyphosphates, or carbosilane dendrimers are less potent HIV-1 inhibitors with IC 50 values in the high \u00b5g L \u22121 to low mg L \u22121 range. [19, 21, 31, 40, 41] On par with the polysulfonates, carboxylates PAA and especially PMAA were also highly potent. By contrast, PEAA and PPAA, two polymers with significantly higher pKa (pK a 6.5 vs 4.5 for PAA) and hence markedly lower ionization at physiological pH, were significantly less active and had IC 50 values >5 mg L \u22121 . Moreover, the three hydrophobic leads identified for the ZIKV treatment are rather inferior inhibitors in the case of HIV-1.

Confirming the finding listed above, we observed that polyanions differed greatly in their antiviral activity. The sulfur-based polyanions proved to be highly potent inhibitors of HSV-2. By contrast, phosphorbased polymers revealed minor, rather insignificant activity against HSV-2. Among the carboxylates, the polymer with the highest anionic character, PAA, exhibited virtually no anti-HSV-2 activity. Benzylic PVBzA and methacrylic PMAA proved to be the strongest inhibitors of HSV-2 among these polymers. We next determined the effect of the 14 polymers against influenza (H5N1) and a panel of viruses for which currently no antiviral therapy exists. For this, we generated lentiviral pseudoparticles encoding luciferase that were pseudotyped with the glycoproteins of Lyssa and Rabies virus (two neurotropic rhabdoviruses that cause rabies in humans and animals), Ebola and Marburg virus (which belong to the family of filoviruses and are responsible for sporadic outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fevers in Africa), SARS coronavirus (that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002), and Lassa virus (an arenavirus that causes Lassa fever). In addition, polymers were analyzed for inhibition of human adenovirus type 5, a nonenveloped virus with clinical relevance for immunosuppressed (transplant) patients. [43, 44] As shown in Figure 8 and Figure S11 (Supporting Information), none of the polymers led to marked inhibition of adenovirus infection, whereas all tested pseudoparticles with the exception of influenza were inhibited by at least two polymers by more than 80% (For overall results of inhibitory activity of the polymer, see Figure 9 ). An important observation from this screen is that \"standard\" strong polyelectrolytes such as PAMPS or highly ionized PAA do not reveal broadness of antiviral activity, and that negative charge alone does not make the polymer a strong antiviral agent. This is further illustrated by the inhibitory activity of poly(phosphates/phosphonates): for all the viral particles, inhibitory effects of these polymers were minimal to nonexistent. A surprising exception to this conclusion is poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA) which proved to be highly effective against Marburg, SARS, and influenza virus, particularly for SARS (Figure 9 ). For influenza, PVPA proved to be the most effective of all the polyanions tested in this work.
