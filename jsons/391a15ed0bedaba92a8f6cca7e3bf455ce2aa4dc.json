We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for conserved epitopes that may help to develop long-lasting, broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

In humans, seven coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections, ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. The first two coronaviruses, human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) and human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), were discovered in the 1960s, and cause relatively mild respiratory symptoms. Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) was identified in 2003, and causes flu-like symptoms and atypical pneumonia in the worst cases [Fouchier et al. 2003 ]. The human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), identified in 2004, and the human CoV-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), described in 2005 [Woo et al. 2005] , generally cause upper respiratory disease in humans, which may progress in lower respiratory infections [Van der Hoek et al. 2004 ]. More recently, the pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus, which appeared for the first time in 2012, was identified as the sixth human coronavirus [Zaki et al. 2012 ]. Finally, a previously unknown coronavirus probably originated in baths, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [Andersen et al. 2020 ,Gorbalenya et al. 2020 ]. SARS-CoV-2 caused an ongoing pandemic of severe pneumonia named coronavirus disease 19 , which has affected over 4 million people worldwide, and caused more than 300.000 deaths as May 13, 2020.",

S protein contains 2 subunits: S1N-terminal domain, responsible for receptor binding, and S2 C-terminal domain, responsible for the fusion. The S2 subunit is the most conserved one, while the S1 subunit differs even within species of the same coronaviruses. The S1 contains two sub-domains (N-terminal and C-terminal), which are both show receptor-binding functions.

The key component of the calculations is the energy estimation matrix, a 20 by 20 matrix, whose elements characterize the general preference of each pair of amino acids to be in contact as derived from globular proteins. This prediction associates a score to each residue in the protein sequence ranging from 0 (strong propensity for an ordered structure) to 1 (strong propensity for a disordered structure), with 0.5 as the cut-off to classify residues as either ordered or disordered.

We note that both the RNA-binding domain (region 41-186) and the dimerization domain (region 258-361) correspond to regions with values less than zero, implying a higher conservation with respect to the rest of the sequence. Although the general trend of the conservation profile hovers around 0, there are some regions where the conservation score is greater than one, indicating that these regions are likely to be under positive selection. Interestingly, the location of some of these regions corresponds to the presence of B cell and T cell epitopes (see Fig. S1 for the specific location and the sequences of each epitope). These segments could display high amino acid variability because amino acid diversity in these regions allows the virus to evade the host immune system recognition. Thus, we can conclude that the source of variability in this regions is likely to be the host immune response. However, it is worth noting the presence of epitopes in highly conserved regions spanning residues 150-200 and 250-315, which may potentially offer long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2.",

The rate variations correspond to different levels of purifying selection acting on these sites .

In this case, we found epitopes in both ordered and disordered regions. Although we noted that the vast majority of epitopes are located in regions having high rates of evolution, we also identified epitopes in conserved protein regions. Similarly, we observed that the SARS-CoV-2 derived B cell and T cell epitopes for the spike S protein are preferentially located in protein regions that are predicted to be ordered and conserved. We thus suggest that the immune targeting of these conserved epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel coronavirus.",

Indeed, RBD immunization induced specific antibodies may block this recognition and thus effectively prevent the invasion of the virus. However, we showed here that both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 (region 437-508) and the fusion peptide (region 788-806) are characterized by high rates of evolution, indicating a tendency for these two regions to mutate and, therefore, overcome the host immunity.",

As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2[Fehr et al 2015;Li 2013;Kuba et al. 2005;Xu et al. 2020].
