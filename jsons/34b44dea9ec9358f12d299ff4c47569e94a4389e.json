            "text": "At P7, Pre LM was the most efficacious treatment paradigm in reducing EEG seizure burdens 352 when quantified as percent seizure suppression (Fig 1E) LM group both ipsi-and contralateral to insult (Fig. S3C) . Post-ischemic TrkB-PLC\u03b31 pathway activation was not evident in ischemic P10 pups 376 In contrast to P7 pups, no increase in pTrkB-Y816 expression was detected in any 377 treatment group at P10 (Fig. S4A-C) . The Pre LM group showed significantly higher ratios of 378 pTrkB-Y816 to TrkB ipsi-and contralateral to insult (Fig. S4D ). PLC\u03b31 expression was not 379 different between treated and untreated pups, though Post and Pre LM pups showed ipsilateral 380 downregulation of pPLC\u03b31-Y783 (Fig. S4E-G) . Ratios of pPLC\u03b31-Y784 to total PLC\u03b31 were not 381 affected by LM intervention (Fig. S4H) . No significant KCC2 degradation was detected in the 382 Ligate+PB group (Fig. S4I and J) following ischemia, though Post LM pups showed lower 383 ipsilateral pKCC2-S940 expression (Fig. S4K, L) . In summary, LM intervention showed mild 384 activation of the TrkB pathway, but KCC2 levels were not significantly modulated at P10 when 385 ischemic seizures were responsive to PB. Post and Pre HIOC groups significantly rescued TrkB-pathway activation (Fig. 5D ) and pTrkB-399 Y816 activation bilaterally (Fig. 5E ). Total ERK1/2 expression was not significantly impacted by 400 ischemic insult or any HIOC treatment (Fig. 5F ) similar to LM intervention (Fig. 4H) . In contrast 401 to Pre LM intervention (Fig. 4I) , Post HIOC and Pre HIOC groups did not demonstrate an 402 increase in pERK1/2-T202/Y204 expression (Fig. 5G ). In summary, the differences in LM vs. (Fig. 6A1, A2 and B) . Developmentally, TrkB expression in the cortex of female pups 426 declined significantly from P5 to P21. In contrast, TrkB expression in males did not decline 427 significantly from P5 to P21. Both female and male pups showed significant decline of pTrkB-428 Y816 expression from P5 to P21 (Fig. 6C ). In the cortex, ratios of pTrkB-Y816 to total TrkB 429 were not significantly different by sex or age (Fig. 6D) . 430 Similar to the results found in the cortex, TrkB expression in the hippocampi of female 431 pups declined significantly from P5 to P21, whereas TrkB expression in males did not decline 432 significantly (Fig. 6E1, E2 , and F). pTrkB-Y816 expression also declined significantly in the 433 hippocampi of female pups from P5 to P21 (Fig. 6G) . Ratios of pTrkB-Y816 to total TrkB were 434 not sexually dimorphic and did not change significantly between ages of P5 to P21 in the 435 hippocampus (Fig. 6H ). In deep gray matter, TrkB expression decreased significantly between 436 P5 and P21 in females, whereas TrkB expression remained stable and did not decline 437 significantly in males (Fig. 6I1, I2 , and J). pTrkB-Y816 expression decreased significantly in 438 both females and males from P5 to P21 (Fig. 6I1, I2 , and K). However, ratios of pTrkB-Y816 to 439 total TrkB were not different between sexes sexually dimorphic and did not change significantly 440 between ages of P5 to P21 in the deep gray matter (Fig. 6L) . These results suggest that sexually 441 dimorphic expression levels of TrkB in the cortex may underlie the sexually dimorphic seizure 442 susceptibility and rescue of PB-refractoriness with LM ( Fig. 1 and 2) , as neonatal seizures are 443 cortical. Furthermore, the attenuation of pTrkB-Y816 from P5 to P21 in both males and females 444 suggests that TrkB pathway activation decreases with age. 445 At P5, females showed significantly higher PLC\u03b31 and pPLC\u03b31-Y783 expression in the 446 cortex than at P21 (Fig. S5A and B) . In contrast, PLC\u03b31 and pPLC\u03b31-Y783 expression in males 447 was not significantly different between age groups. The hippocampus and deep gray matter did 448 not show significant differences between sexes in PLC\u03b31 or pPLC\u03b31-Y783 expression during 449 development (Fig. S5D, E, G, and H) . Similarly, ratios of pPLC\u03b31-Y783 to total PLC\u03b31 were not 450 significantly different between sexes during development for all examined brain regions (Fig. 451 S5C, F, and I). Males showed a significant increase in KCC2 expression between P5 and P21, and P7 455 and P21, whereas females did not (Fig. S5J and K) . pKCC2-S940 was not found to be 456 significantly dephosphorylated in both sexes ( Fig. S5J and K) . In contrast, only females showed 457 significantly lower ratios of pKCC2-S940 to total KCC2 in the cortex (Fig. S5L ). In the 458 hippocampus, both males and females did not show a significant change in KCC2 expression 459 ( Fig. S5M and N) . pKCC2-S940 expression and ratios of pKCC2-S940 to total KCC2 were not 460 found to be sexually dimorphic between ages (Fig. S5M-O) . In deep gray matter, both females 461 and males showed significantly lower expression of pKCC2-S940 at P21 (Fig. S5P-R) TrkB signaling is known to be sexually dimorphic in a region-specific manner (80-82). 584 In BDNF +/mice, greater levels of pTrkB-Y705 activation were shown in the frontal cortex and 585 striatum of male mice 10-16 weeks of age compared to females. These changes in TrkB 586 phosphorylation state were accompanied by concomitant increases in ERK1/2 587 phosphorylation(80), suggesting a differential signaling mechanism that was sexually dimorphic. 588 The developmental expression of KCC2 is also known to increase with age, and this 589 developmental profile is sex-dependent, with female pups expressing higher levels than male 590 pups (15, 83, 84) Table S1 normalized to housekeeping protein \u03b2-actin.

We have previously demonstrated the post-ischemic 64 activation of the TrkB-PLC\u03b31 pathway results in the hypofunction of the K-Cl co-transporter 65 (KCC2) in a mouse model of acute neonatal ischemia associated with phenobarbital (cation-chloride transporter KCC2 is the primary neuronal Clextruder 68 and enables hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition in the brain. The residue Ser940 (S940) on 69 the C-terminus of KCC2 is associated with its membrane stability and chloride extrusion 70 capacity (6, 7). The developmental switch in GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to 71 hyperpolarizing (8) is enabled by an age-dependent increase of KCC2 expression (9). In the 72 neonatal period, KCC2 expression is low and GABA is depolarizing (8-10). In addition, KCC2 73 is susceptible to degradation following excitotoxic injury (2, 11, 12). In our characterized CD-1 74 mouse model of ischemic neonatal seizures, KCC2 underwent degradation and 75 dephosphorylation of residue S940 (5). This rendered the ASM PB inefficacious (5), as PB is a 76 positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (13). Prevention of BDNF-TrkB mediated 77 KCC2 hypofunction rescued PB-refractoriness in CD-1 pups (5). We hypothesized that the 78 BDNF mimetic LM22A-4 (LM) (14) would interfere with the post-ischemic BDNF-TrkB 79 signaling underlying the emergence of refractoriness. 80 This study utilized a characterized model of PB-refractory neonatal ischemic seizures at 81 P7 and PB-responsive ischemic seizures at P10 (2, 5, 15). The efficacy of two graded doses 82 (0.25mg/kg [LM] and 2.5mg/kg [LM2.5]) of the BDNF loop II mimetic, LM, was compared to 83 the novel full TrkB agonists HIOC (16) and DG (17). HIOC is an N-acetylserotonin (NAS) 84 derivative that exhibits more robust neurotrophic effects than NAS in a TrkB-dependent manner 85 (16, 18). DG is a naturally occurring compound in the gedunin family that has shown robust 86 neuroprotective properties in rats in a TrkB-dependent manner (17). The developmental profile 87 of TrkB in neonatal brains is shown to decrease with age (19-22) and was also investigated here 88 in the CD-1 strain. The role of TrkB receptor in neonatal seizure susceptibility was were done in compliance with the Johns Hopkins University Committee 95 on the Ethics of Animal Experiments (Permit A3272-01) and approved by the Animal Care and 96 Use Committee of Johns Hopkins.

Continuous 2h vEEG/EMG 222 recordings were used to identify and quantify post-ischemic electrographic seizure burdens(Fig.   223    1B-D). The seizure burden in the Ligate+PB group remained unchanged following PB224 administration, indicating PB-refractoriness. The Post and Pre LM groups both showed 225 significant rescue of PB-refractoriness (Fig. 1B-E). Clustering of ictal events was noted in the 226 Ligate+PB raster plot following PB injection (i.e. Ligate+PB 2 nd h vs. 1 st h) without overall 227 reduction in seizure burdens (Fig. 1D). Both the Post and Pre LM groups also showed similar 228 clustering of ictal events, although this was associated with a concomitant significant reduction 229 in overall seizure burdens following PB administration (Fig. 1D and E). When quantified as 230 percent seizure suppression over the 1 st hour baseline, intervention with LM+PB significantly 231 increased seizure suppression in P7 seizing pups (Fig 1E), in contrast to intervention with only 232 PB which failed to show seizure suppression (-4.46\u00b15.34%). 233 Neonatal seizure susceptibility and ASM efficacy has been shown to be sexually 234 dimorphic (5, 15, 23, 25, 26), therefore sex as a biological variable was investigated. At P7, both 235 sexes were PB-refractory. Female pups were significantly responsive to LM intervention in both 236 the Post and Pre LM groups, whereas male pups only responded in the Pre LM group (Fig. 1F). 237 Furthermore, percent seizure suppression in female pups was not significantly different between 238 the Post and Pre LM groups, demonstrating that pre-ischemic LM intervention did not provide 239 females any additional benefit in the rescue of PB-refractoriness. However, female pups in the 240 Post LM group showed significantly greater percent seizure suppression than male pups in the 241Post LM group, highlighting important sex differences in the efficacy of LM at P7.242   As previously characterized for the model, neonatal ischemic seizures at P10 were PB-243 responsive in both sexes (15)(Fig. 1G, H), supporting a developmental influence on PB-efficacy.244    At P10, only the Pre LM group showed significant improvement in PB-efficacy(Fig. 1G). In 245 contrast to P7, no sexual dimorphism was noted for either the Post or Pre LM treatment groups at 246 P10(Fig. 1H), highlighting the role of developmental age in sexual dimorphism. In summary,247    LM intervention significantly rescued PB-refractoriness at P7 and improved PB-efficacy at P10.248 249 No dose-dependent effect for a graded dose of LM 250 To evaluate the dose-dependent efficacy of LM, a ten-fold higher dose (0.25 vs. 251 2.5mg/kg) was evaluated for PB-refractory seizures at P7. The Post LM2.5 group significantly 252 suppressed PB-refractory seizures by 42.77\u00b19.98%, similar to but not significantly better than 253 the Post LM 0.25mg/kg dose (two-tailed t test, p=0.6375). In contrast, the Pre LM2.5 group 254 failed to significantly rescue PB-refractory seizures (18.15\u00b116% seizure suppression, Fig. S1A). 255 In contrast to the 0.25mg/kg dose, there were no significant differences in seizure suppression 256 between sexes in the Post and Pre LM2.5 groups (Fig. S1B). The significant seizure suppression 257 in both the Post LM and Post LM 2.5 groups indicated a nonlinear dose-response curve (27). 258 To evaluate the effect of TrkB agonists LM and HIOC on plasma membrane expression 259 of TrkB and KCC2, na\u00efve P7 mouse pup brain slices were incubated with either 0.75mM or 260 7.5mM graded doses of LM, or a 1.7mM dose of HIOC. These in vitro doses mimicked the in 261vivo doses used to study anti-seizure efficacies (.25mg/kg, 2.5mg/kg, and 5mg/kg respectively).262    Incubation of na\u00efve P7 brain slices with the TrkB agonists showed no significant increase in 263 pTrkB-Y816 and KCC2 expression at the plasma membrane(Fig S1C, D). Similarly the ratio of 264 pTrkB-Y816 to total TrkB at the membrane failed to show a significant dose-dependent increase265   with either LM or HIOC(Fig. S1E). The S940/KCC2 ratios at the membrane were also not 266 significantly modulated by LM or HIOC(Fig. S1F). These in vitro findings indicate that the 267 rescue of KCC2 expression by LM and HIOC is specific to the post-ischemic activation of the 268 BDNF-TrkB pathway in seizing pups. In the absence of the ischemic injury, the TrkB agonists 269 did not significantly modulate either TrkB or KCC2 insertion at the membrane.270 271 Effect on frequency and duration of neonatal ischemic seizures 272 To investigate the seizure semiology, seizure burden was evaluated as the total amount of 273 time spent seizing on EEG. Baseline seizure burdens (i.e.; represented by the seizures during the 274 1 st hour of EEG recording) for each treatment group in this study were not significantly different 275 from each other at P7 (Fig. 2A) and P10 (Fig. 2B). At P7, the Post and Pre LM groups 276 demonstrated significant reductions in seizure burdens during the 2 nd hour following PB 277 administration (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the Ligate+PB group failed to reduce seizure burdens in the 278 2 nd hour, demonstrating PB-refractoriness. At P10 for the same ischemic insult, baseline seizure 279 burdens were significantly lower than at P7 (Fig. 2B vs. 2A), as previously characterized for the 280 model (2, 5, 15). Both the Post and Pre LM groups showed significant reduction in seizure 281 burdens following PB administration, similar to the Ligate+PB group. 282Analysis of the number of ictal events(Fig. 2C and D)in all treatment groups revealed 283 that the significant seizure suppression(Fig. 1)with LM intervention was driven by significant 284 reductions in the number of ictal events at both P7 and P10(Fig. 2C and D). PB-refractoriness in285    the Ligate+PB group at P7 was driven by a significant increase in ictal durations(Fig. 2E). In 286 contrast, ictal durations during the 2 nd hour in the Post and Pre LM groups were not significantly 287 different at both P7 and P10(Fig. 2E and F). P7 female pups in both the Post and Pre LM groups 288 had significantly lower 2 nd hour seizure burdens than their respective 1 st hour(Fig.  , the 1 st hour seizure burdens for both male and female pups in the Ligate+PB 292 group had significantly lower 1 st hour seizure burdens than their respective P7 counterparts(Fig.   293    2H). In contrast to P7, the P10 Ligate+PB group demonstrated differences between sexes as only 294 males had significantly lower seizure burdens in the 2 nd hour than their respective 1 st hour. The 295 females in the Post LM group at P10 had significantly lower seizure burdens in the 2 nd hour than 296 their respective 1 st hour, similar to P7. In contrast, both P10 males and females in the Pre LM 297 group had significantly lower 2 nd hour seizures burdens than their respective 1 st hour, similar to298    Pre LM at P7. The sex-dependent differences in ictal events and durations at both ages were not 299 significant (Fig. 2I-L).",

EEG power suppression was examined to evaluate efficacy of LM intervention304    (for example 10min EEG seizure trace see S2A-D). The Ligate+PB group showed similar 305 percent EEG power suppression to the LM-treated groups(Fig. S2E), which was driven by 306 reductions in the 2 nd hour EEG powers in all treatment groups. Therefore, EEG spectral power 307 evaluated in a subset of LM-treated P7 pups failed to estimate accurate seizure burdens both in 308 the Ligate+PB and LM-treated groups (Fig. S2F), indicating the unreliability of EEG power to 309 detect accurate seizure burdens. Overall EEG power diminishes with the occurrence of repeated 310 ischemic seizures (30). This phenomenon has also been reported for clinical EEGs (31). The 311 correlation between percent EEG power suppression and percent seizure suppression showed 312 that quantification of EEG power alone could not accurately measure seizure burdens (Fig. inactivation facilitates post-ischemic amelioration of seizure susceptibility at P7 316 To investigate the role of post-ischemic TrkB-pathway activation at P7 in vivo, TrkB 317 activation was chemogenetically inhibited by 1NMPP1 from P0-P7 in C57BL/6 Knockin 318 TrkB F616A (F616A +/+ ) pups. Following unilateral carotid ligation, WT -/pups administered 319 1NMPP1 showed significantly higher 1 st h seizure burdens than F616A +/+ pups administered 320 1NMPP1 (Fig. 3A-D) demonstrating that the chemogenetic inactivation of TrkB significantly 321 reduced the post-ischemic seizure susceptibility in P7 neonatal pups. EEG seizure burdens were 322 significantly lower in the F616A +/+ pups in the 1 st h following ischemia. EEG seizure burdens 323 evaluated by sex, found no sex dependent differences. PB-administration at the end if 1h in WT -/-324 C57BL/6 pups (Fig 3D) was efficacious. These results support the established importance of 325 genetic background on ischemia and seizures as phenotypic severity is strain dependent (32-34). 326 Specifically, the CD-1 strain shows phenotype severity and emergence of refractory neonatal 327 seizures with added translational value in comparison to C57BL/6 strain. Overall, these results 328 demonstrate that post-ischemic activation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling cascade plays a crucial 329 role in neonatal seizure susceptibility. 330 331 Post-ischemic TrkB-PLC\u03b31 pathway activation at P7 was rescued by LM intervention 332 Ischemic insults are known to induce BDNF-TrkB pathway activation (5, 35), and 333 phosphorylation of Y816 on TrkB activates the PLC\u03b31 pathway, which has been implicated both 334 acutely (5) and chronically in epileptogenesis (36). 24h post-ischemia, pups in the Ligate+PB 335 group showed significant increase of TrkB and pTrkB-Y816 expression ipsi-and contralateral to 336 ischemic insult (Fig. 4A-C), indicating global TrkB activation in the unilateral model. With the 337 unilateral ischemia model used in this study, ispi-vs. contralateral-hemispheric differences in 338 protein expression were also analyzed. The Post LM group showed attenuated TrkB expression 339ipsilateral to ischemic insult(Fig. 4A).

Comparing both of these 416 TrkB agonists to LM highlights that male and female pups differentially responded to BDNF 417 loop II mimetics and full TrkB agonists.

            "text": "The complexity of BDNF function is apparent in its role as a selective regulator of gene 501 expression via its modulation of RNA-binding proteins, and micro-RNAs [reviewed in (49)]. 502 Additionally, both the human and rodent BDNF gene consist of 9 exons, each with their own 503 promoters resulting in at least 10 different transcripts [reviewed in (50)]. These alternative Bdnf 504 transcripts undergo unique temporal and spatial modulation that allow different factors, such as 505 hypoxic response elements, to regulate BDNF signaling in a cell-type and circuit-specific 506 manner (39, 51). The overexpression of a cleavage resistant precursor of BDNF (proBDNF) has 507 been demonstrated to reduce KCC2 protein expression via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (52), 508 further highlighting the complexity of BDNF-TrkB signaling in health and disease. 509 Downstream activation of the TrkB-PLC\u03b31-pathway has been tied to KCC2 hypofunction 510 by several studies (11, 12, 53). In an adult model of limbic epilepsy, prevention of PLC\u03b31-511 pathway activation prevented epileptogenesis (54, 55). Further, AAV-Cre mediated reduction of 512 KCC2 in the CA1 and dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus resulted in some of the 513 core phenotypes of medial temporal lobe epilepsy, such as spontaneous seizures, gliosis, and 514 neuronal loss (56). These results from adult mouse models of epilepsy, and the prevalence of 515 pathogenic KCC2 mutations in human epilepsy (57) support the critical role of KCC2 and 516 pathways that promote its hypofunction in epilepsy. 517 Previous work in the neonatal brain has demonstrated the importance of preventing 518 BNDF-TrkB activation following excitotoxic injury when using a small-molecule TrkB 519 antagonist ANA12 [(5), see schematic Fig 7]. ANA12 prevented the activation of the TrkB-the proposed binding of LM to TrkB (14), and the observation that LM 524 intervention was efficacious, our data suggest that the presence and subsequent binding of LM to 525 TrkB also prevents the cascade of endogenous post-ischemic BDNF-TrkB signaling similar to 526 the TrkB antagonist ANA12. Taken together these data indicate that the BDNF loop II mimetic 527 LM and TrkB antagonist ANA12 both act as TrkB antagonists to the endogenous BDNF released 528 in the post-ischemic neonatal brain (2, 5, 15). 529 TrkB-ERK1/2 pathway modulation by the BDNF loop II mimetic 530 LM binding to TrkB lead to the activation of the TrkB-ERK1/2 pathway, similar to 531 previous reports from in vitro studies that peptide mimetics of either loop I, III, or IV of BDNF 532 can induce AKT and ERK phosphorylation (58, 59). TrkB activation also phosphorylates 533 residue Y816 on its intracellular domain, which permits recruitment and activation of the PLC\u03b31 534 pathway, which activates numerous pathways including the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinases 535 (60, 61). In this study, LM rescued the ischemia-induced phosphorylation of residue Y816 on 536 TrkB, suggesting that the prevention of the TrkB-PLC\u03b31 pathway mediated KCC2 degradation 537 occurred by LM binding to TrkB. 538 It has been shown that the use of HIOC in vivo protected retinas from excitotoxic retinal 539 degeneration in a TrkB-dependent manner (16). Although both LM and HIOC significantly 540 rescued PB-refractoriness at P7, HIOC functioned differently than LM as it did not induce 541 activation of the TrkB-ERK1/2 pathway. These results indicate that TrkB agonists can prevent 542 emergence of refractory seizures by preventing the pathological BDNF-(61), which regulates a multitude of processes, including cell migration, 546 differentiation, proliferation, and transcription (62, 63). Previous literature has demonstrated that 547 LM promoted cell survival in a model of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (64). 548 Supporting these results, the Pre LM group showed a significant increase in pERK1/2-549 T202/Y204 expression. Intervention with BDNF loop II mimetic LM was shown to have 550 beneficial long-term effects in vivo, particularly in rescuing adult post-traumatic cortical 551 epileptogenesis in a TrkB-dependent manner (65), supporting the findings reported in this study. 552 553 Evidence for BDNF hyperactivity in neurological disorders 554 In autism, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with pathogenesis that occurs during the 555 neonatal period, the early hyperactivity of BDNF may play an important role as high BDNF 556 levels have been reported in neonatal blood samples from children with autistic spectrum 557 disorders (66, 67). Valproic acid (VPA) exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of 558 congenital malformations and autism (68-70). VPA administration to pregnant rodents during 559 the 2 nd week of gestation is a well-investigated model of autism (71). The VPA model of autism 560 has demonstrated increased BDNF (71), increased neuronal intracellular chloride concentration 561 (72), and a disruption of the GABA developmental sequence (72, 73). Research utilizing a 562 preclinical model of Fragile X syndrome, an inherited form of intellectual disability and autism 563 spectrum disorder, administered LM to neonatal Fmr1 KO mice and rescued cell type is complex. This concept is already evident in recent literature that has shown 568 evidence of TrkB receptor activation and signaling without dimerization, suggesting that TrkB 569 can under certain conditions exist and function as a monomeric receptor at the plasma membrane 570 (75). Moreover, recent studies examining plasma membrane diffusion kinetics have 571 demonstrated that up to 20% of the Trk family may exist as dimers or oligomers prior to 572 neurotrophin binding (76), though their function remains a topic of debate (77). These 573 observations warrant further investigation of the complexities involved in neurotrophin-based 574 signaling in vivo. One specific example of the in vivo complexity of BDNF-TrkB signaling is in 575 the superoxide dismutase 1 mouse model of familial ALS (78). In this model, the complete 576 deletion of TrkB in motor neurons in vivo slowed the progression of the disease and permitted 577 the maintenance of motor function (78). Another indication of the complexity of BDNF-TrkB 578 signaling is in vitro studies that have identified that an increase in BDNF renders motor neurons 579 more susceptible to excitotoxic insults in a TrkB dependent manner, however, not all motor 580 neurons were protected by blocking TrkB (79). 581 582 Sexually dimorphic developmental profiles of TrkB and KCC2 583",
