            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the 34 ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , a public health emergency of 35 international concern declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). An immuno-36 informatics approach along with comparative genomic was applied to design a multi-epitope-37 based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E 38 proteins. The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced 39 bioinformatics tools. The candidate vaccine showed an average of \u2265 90.0% world population 40 coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the 41 immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted 42 significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with 43 high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and 44 cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased INF-\u03b3 and IL-2 cytokines. The codon optimization and 45 mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed the chimera is suitable for high-level expression 46 and cloning. Overall, the constructed recombinant chimeric vaccine candidate demonstrated 47 significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global 48 threat, COVID-19. 49 50 51 52 53 Epitope. 55 58 Emergence of novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome 59 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 60 December 2019 is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 61 (COVID-19). The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has already made its alarmingly quick 62 transmission across the globe in 199 countries and regions with a total of 723,077 active 63 infection cases and 33,983 deaths until March 29, 2020 1 . World Health Organization (WHO) has 64 declared a global health emergency, and scientists are racing over the clock to develop effective 65 interventions for controlling and preventing COVID-19 by analyzing novel SARS-CoV-2 66 genomics, functional structures, and its host-pathogen interactions. Efforts to contain the virus 67 are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and 68 virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown. 69 This SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronovairus (CoV) that can infect human after the two 70 previously reported coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) 2,3 and Middle 71 East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) 4-6 . Alike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent 72 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) belonging to Genus 73 Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae 7 . The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 74 approximately 30 kilobases (between 26,000 and 32,000 bases) in length 8 , and encodes for 75 multiple structural and non-structural proteins 7 . The four major structural proteins of CoVs are 76 the spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid 77 protein (N) 7 . Among these proteins, the S glycoprotein is composed of two main domains, the 78 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), 9,10 which play essential role for 79 the attachment and entry of viral particles into the host cells 11,12 and characterized by high 80 antigenicity and surface exposure 2,11,13 . 81 To combat the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2, Scientists applied different vaccine 82 strategies globally. In addition, a curative approach using different drug candidates have been 83 tried so far to combat the current pandemic COVID-19. However, COVID-19 is marching too 84 fast and reached almost every territory in earth. Hence, apart from developing novel drugs 85 against this viral infection, a very potent vaccine candidate is very much desirable. Being an 86 RNA virus, the virus had undergone mutations several times already in the last 4 months 14 . As a 87 result, instead of single epitope, multi-epitope based vaccines can play a great role in fighting 88 against this novel CoV. 89 On coronaviruses, the component primarily targeted by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is 90 the trimeric S glycoprotein of the virion consisting of three homologous chains (A, B and C), 91 which mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion during viral entry into sensitive cells 92",

However, with the 93 rapid evolution and high genomic variation of RNA viruses, mutations on the RBD may enable 94 the new strains to escape neutralization by currently known RBD-targeting antibodies. 95 Therefore, other functional regions of the S glycoprotein can be important for developing 96 effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several 97 mAbs targeting non-RBD regions, especially the NTD has recently been reported 13,15 . The NTD 98 is located on the side of the spike trimer and has not been observed to undergo any dynamic 99 conformational changes 11 , and therefore, might play role in viral attachment, inducing 100 neutralizing antibody responses and stimulates a protective cellular immunity against SARS-101",

Across the CoV families, the 433 antibodies against the S glycoprotein, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 would provide 434 immunity to the infection 2,12,22 . Therefore, this work focused on the in silico design and 435 development of a potential multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 selecting epitopes and 436 domains from the S, E and M proteins. 437 Among the structural elements of CoVs, the spike S glycoproteins are composed of two 438 major domains, the RBD and NTD. Furthermore, the homotrimeric S proteins of the SARS-439 CoV-2, SARS-CoV 9,10 and MERS-CoV 5 comprises three chains: the chain A, B and C on the 440 viral surface, guiding the link to host receptors. Unlike the full-length S protein of the CoVs, the 441 RBD and NTD segments possessed the critical neutralizing domains but lacking the non-442 neutralizing immunodominant region 6,10,11,22 . Therefore, considering the safety and effectiveness 443 perspectives, the RBD and NTD are more promising candidates in the development of SARS-444 CoV-2 vaccines over the full-length S protein. The presence of E and M proteins on the envelope 445 can augment the immune response against SARS-CoV 2,36 and thus, considered for suitable 446 candidate for vaccine development 7,12,22 . Therefore, antibodies against the S, informatics analyses of the selected RBD and NTD regions indicated that these 449 contain ample amount of high-affinity B-cell, MHC Class I, MHC Class II and interferon-\u03b3 450 (IFN-\u03b3) epitopes with high antigenicity scores. Moreover, membrane B-cell epitope (MBE) and 451 envelop B-cell epitope (EBE) were selected from the M and E proteins, respectively for the final 452 vaccine construct to enhance the overall stability, immunogenicity and antigenicity of the 453 chimeric vaccine candidate, the CoV-RMEN 21 . The HLA alleles maintain the response to T-cell 454 epitopes, and in different ethnic communities and geographical regions, these alleles are highly 455polymorphic. T-cell epitopes from RBD and NTD regions having high interaction with more 456 HLA alleles were found to cover more than 98% of the world population with different ethnic 457 groups 6,37,38 .

These two structural forms (secondary and 476 tertiary), when tested as the synthetic peptides, have the ability to fold into their native 477 structure,hence, could be recognized by naturally induced antibodies in response to infection 2 . 478The tertiary (3D) structure of the vaccine candidate improved markedly after the refinement, and 479showed desirable properties based on Ramachandran plot predictions. The Ramachandran plot 480shows that most of the residues are found in the favoured and allowed regions (94.7%) with very 481 few residues in the outlier region; this indicates that the quality of the overall model is 482 satisfactory 21,23 . The lack of allergenic properties of the CoV-RMEN further strengthens its 483 potential as a vaccine candidate. Strikingly, the multi-epitope peptide we designed and484 constructed (CoV-RMEN), showed higher antigenicity scores on Vaxijen v2.0 (0.450 with a 485 virus model at a threshold of 0.4) and ANTIGENpro (0.875) gave an antigenic score almost 486 twice that of Ov-103 on ANTIGENpro (0.93 for the chimeric peptide and 0.59 for Ov-103) 487 supporting that this multiple-epitopes carrying vaccine candidate would be poorly immunogenic 488 and require coupling to adjuvants. However, the designed protein must show similar antigenicity 489 scores with and without the addition of an adjuvant sequence 21 . 490 It has been reported that immunity to viral infections is dependent on both B-and T-491 cells 20,21 . Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) recognize Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns 492 (PAMPs) from viral components or replication intermediates, resulting in signaling cascades that 493 initiate an antiviral state in cells as a result of infection 41 . However, it is likely that TLRs might 494 play an important role in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection 42 . Though, we 495 did not use any adjuvants, it is reported that TLRs (TLR3 and TLR4) can effectively bind with 496 spike protein of the CoV 43 . The molecular docking analysis of the CoV-RMEN through 497 HADDOCK showed that the chimeric protein can establish stable protein-protein interactions 498 with TLRs (TLR-3,TLR-4) 41 indicating efficient activation of these surface molecules which is 499 very crucial for immune activation of dendritic cells for subsequent antigen processing and 500 presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via MHC-II and MHC-1, respectively corroborating the 501 findings of different earlier studies 11,20,21 . TLR 4 might bind to S protein leading to the 502 activation of the MyD88 dependent signaling pathway, which ultimately releases 503 proinflammatory cytokines 35 . Immune simulation of the designed CoV-RMEN showed results 504 consistent with typical immune responses, and there was a general increase in the generated 505 immune responses after repeated antigen exposures. The comprehensive immune response 506 developed after repeated antigen exposure reflected a perfect host defence development with the 507 uplifted primary immune response and subsequent secondary immune response resulting in 508 immune memory development 2 . In the present study, the development of memory B-cells and T-509 cells was evident, with memory in B-cells lasting for several months. Helper T-cells were 510 particularly stimulated. The engrossing findings of the study is the development of Th1 response 511 which enhance the growth and proliferation of B-cells augmenting the adaptive immunity 44 . The 512 antiviral cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and cell stimulatory IL-2 level significantly increased which also 513 contribute to the subsequent immune response after vaccination in host 2 . This indicates high 514 levels of helper T-cells and consequently efficient antibody production, supporting a humoral 515 response 21,45 . The Simpson index, D for investigation of clonal specificity suggests a possible 516 diverse immune response. This is plausible considering the generated chimeric peptide is 517 composed of sufficient B-and T-cell epitopes. 518 One of the first steps in validating a candidate vaccine is to screen for immunoreactivity 519 through serological analysis. This requires the expression of the recombinant protein in a suitable 520 host. Escherichia coli expression systems are the preferred choice for the production of 521 recombinant proteins 33 . In order to achieve high-level expression of our recombinant vaccine 522 protein in E. coli (strain K12), codon optimization was carried out. Stable mRNA structure, 523 codon adaptability index (0.87), and the GC content (50.26%) were favourable for high-level 524 expression of the protein in bacteria. The next step projected at the moment, is to express this 525 peptide in a bacterial system and perform the various immunological assays needed to validate 526 the results obtained here through immuno-informatics analyses. 527 528 Conclusions 529 COVID-19 is reaching entire globe and emergence of the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 530kept us nowhere as we are racing for treatment and prevention.

Moreover, two 555 reference genome sequences of SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3) and MERS-CoV (NC_019843.3) 556were also retrieved from the NCBI database to reveal the structural heterogeneity of S protein. 557Multiple sequence alignment of the S proteins of the viruses was performed by CLUSTALW 45 . 558Since the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is important for viral attachment to host cell, antibody 559 against this protein acts as inhibitor 30 , therefore, S proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 560 SARS-CoV-2 were structurally compared using SWISS homology modeling 46 based on the 561 protein databank (PDB) templates 6acd, 5w9h and 6vsb, respectively. The models were then 562 optimized by energy minimization using the GROMOS96 program 27 implemented within the 563 Swiss-PdbViewer, version 4.1.0 47 .

To find out the most probable peptide-based epitopes 587 with better confidence level, selected peptides were further tested using VaxiJen antigenicity 588 scores 51 . The Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity profiling from IEDB analysis resource was 589 also used for RBD and NTD segments, E and M proteins 55 . 590 591Screening for T-cell epitopes 592Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) tool peptide binding to MHC class I ://tools.iedb.org/main/tcell/) were used to screen CTL epitopes, proteasomal cleavage and 595 transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) with all parameters set to default. 596Threshold for strong binding peptides (IC 50 ) was set at 50 nM to determine the binding and 597 interaction potentials of helper T-cell epitope peptide and major histocompatibility complex 598 (MHC) class I allele 20,23 . The total score generated by the tool is a combined score of 599 proteasome, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), TAP (N-terminal interaction), processing 600 analysis scores. The HTL epitopes were screened using the IEDB tool \"MHC-II Binding 601Predictions\" (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/). The tool generated the median percentile rank for each 602 predicted epitope through combination of three methods (Combinatorial Library, SMM-align,603 and Sturniolo) by comparing the score of peptide against the scores of other random five million 604 15-mer peptides from the SwissProt database 28 . Top five HLA epitopes for each RBD and NTD 605 segments were docked against the respective HLA (MHC-and MHC-) allele binders by 606 interaction similarity-based protein-peptide docking system GalaxyPepDock of the GalaxyWeb, 607 docked HLA-epitope complexes were refined in GalaxyRefineComplex and binding affinity 608 (\u0394G) was determined PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY) tool 56 . 609 610 Population coverage by CTL and HTL epitopes 611 Due to the MHC restriction of T-cell response, the peptides with more different HLA 612 binding specificities mean more population coverage in defined geographical regions and ethnic 613 groups where-and-to-whom the peptide-based vaccine might be employed. The predicted T-cell 614 epitopes were shortlisted based on the aligned Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with half-615 maximal inhibitory concentration (annIC 50 ) values up to 50 nM. The IEDB \"Population 616 Coverage\" tool (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) 57 was used to determine the world human 617 population coverage by the shortlisted CTL and HTL epitopes. We used multi-epitopes involving 618 both CTL and HTL epitopes to have the higher probability of larger human population coverage 619 worldwide. We used OmicsCircos to visualize the association between world population and 620 different ethnic groups 58 . 621 622 IFN-\u03b3-inducing epitope prediction 623 Potential IFN-\u03b3 epitopes of all the selected antigenic sites of RBD, NTD, envelop protein 624 B-cell epitope (EBE), and membrane protein B-cell epitope (MBE) were predicted by 625 \"IFNepitope\" server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ ifnepitope/scan.php). To identify the set of 626 epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted 627 the \"Motif and SVM hybrid\" (MERCI: Motif-EmeRging and with Classes-Identification, and 628 SVM) approach. The tool generates overlapping sequences from the query antigens for IFN-\u03b3-629 inducing epitope prediction. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of 630 individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T 631 cell epitope from the set, and finally the coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated 632 with any of the remaining MHC alleles 2 . The prediction is based on a dataset of IFN-\u03b3-inducing 633 and IFN-\u03b3-noninducing MHC allele binders 59 . 634 635 Design and construction of multi-epitope vaccine candidate 636 The candidate vaccine design and construction method follows previously developed 637 FMD peptide vaccine development protocol in Professor M Anwar Hossain's laboratory 638 (unpublished data, and under patent application in Bangladesh Application No. 639 P/BD/2018/000280, date: October 1, 2018; India Patent Number: 201924036919, Date: 640 September 13, 2019). The multi-epitope protein was constructed by positioning the selected 641 RBD, NTD, MBE and EBE amino acid sequences linked with short, rigid and flexible linkers 642 GG. To develop highly immunogenic recombinant proteins, two universal T-cell epitopes were 643 used, namely, a pan-human leukocyte antigen DR-binding peptide (PADRE) 60 , and an invasin 644 immunostimulatory sequence taken from Yersinia (Invasin) 61 were used to the N and C terminal 645 of the vaccine construct respectively, linked with EGGE. Here, acidic aa, Glutamate (E) was 646 added to balance the ratio of acidic and basic amino acids. We denoted the vaccine candidate as 647 CoV-RMEN. VaxiJen 2.0 52 and ANTIGENpro (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) web-648 servers were used to predict the antigenicity of the CoV-RMEN while the AllerTOP 2.0 649 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP) and AllergenFP (http://ddg-pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/) 650 web-servers were used to predict vaccine allergenicity. 651 Various physiochemical parameters of the CoV-RMEN were assessed using the online 654 web-server ProtParam 50 . These parameters included aa residue composition, theoretical pI, 655 instability index, in vitro and in vivo half-life, aliphatic index, molecular weight, and grand 656 average of hydropathicity (GRAVY). The solubility of the multi-epitope vaccine peptide was 657 evaluated using the Protein-Sol server (https://protein-sol.manchester.ac.uk/://raptorx.uchicago.edu/StructurePropertyPred/predict/) 62 , web-servers were used for 663 secondary structure predictions. The RaptorX web-server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) 62 was 664 used to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure and binding residues of the chosen protein. 665 Homology modelling of the CoV-RMEN was carried out using the protein homology/analogy 666 recognition engine (Phyre2) (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index) web-667 server. 668 669 Refinement and validation of the tertiary structure of the CoV-RMEN 670 The 3D model obtained for the CoV-RMEN was refined in a three-step process, initially 671 energy minimization using the GROMOS96 program 27 implemented within the Swiss-672 PdbViewer (version 4.1.0) 47 . After energy minimization, the model was refined using 673 ModRefiner (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ModRefiner/) and then GalaxyRefine server 674 (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=REFINE). The construction and refinement 675 of the CoV-RMEN was further assessed through ModRefiner server for atomic-level energy 676 minimization. This results in improvements in both global and local structures, with more 677 accurate side chain positions, better hydrogen-bonding networks, and fewer atomic overlaps 63 . 678",

All simulation parameters were set at default with 693 time steps set at 1, 84, and 170 (each time step is 8 hours and time step 1 is injection at time = 0). 694Therefore, three injections were given at four weeks apart. The Simpson index, D (a measure of 695 diversity) was interpreted from the plot. 696Molecular docking of the CoV-RMEN with TLRs 698The generation of an appropriate immune response is dependent on the interaction 699 between an antigenic molecule and a specific immune receptor like Toll Like Receptors 700 (TLRs)33  . Molecular docking of the CoV-RMEN with the TLR3 (PDB ID: 1ZIW) and TLR4 701 (PDB ID: 4G8A) receptor was performed using the High Ambiguity Driven DOCKing 702 (HADDOCK, version 2.4) 65 web-server in order to evaluate the interaction between ligand and 703 receptor and consequently the development of an immune response. In order to predict such 704 interaction, data-driven docking of designed chimeric protein and TLR3 and TLR4 complexes 705 were performed 33 . In this regard, CPORT (https://milou.science.uu.nl/services/CPORT/) was 706 used to predict active interface residues of the CoV-RMEN and TLRs. The HADDOCK server 707 was then employed to perform docking simulations of the CoV-RMEN-TLRs complexes due to 708 perform short MD simulations of docked complexes 56 . Finally, the binding affinities of the top-709 ranking docking pose of chimeric protein-TLRs complexes was predicted using the PRODIGY 710 (PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction) (https://nestor.science.uu.nl/prodigy/) web-server56  .711 712 Analysis of cDNA and mRNA for cloning and expression 713 Reverse translation and codon optimization were performed using the GenScript Rare 714 Codon Analysis Tool (https://www.genscript.com/tools/rare-codon-analysis) in order to express 715 the CoV-RMEN in a selected expression vector. Codon optimization was performed in order to 716 express the final vaccine construct in the E. coli (strain K12). The analysis output includes the 717 codon adaptation index (CAI) and percentage GC content, which can be used to assess protein 718 expression levels. CAI provides information on codon usage biases; the ideal CAI score is 1.0 719 but >0.8 is considered a good score 66 . The GC content of a sequence should range between 30-720 70%. GC content values outside this range suggest unfavorable effects on translational and 721 transcriptional efficiencies 22 . Stability of the mRNA was measured using two different tools 722 namely RNAfold (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) and the mfold 723 (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold) web-servers. To clone the optimized gene sequence of 724 the final vaccine construct in E. coli into pETite vector (Lucigen, USA) through enzyme-free 725 method. The primers for amplification of the DNA fragment must contain 18-nucletide short 726 DNA sequence (5'-CGCGAACA-GATTGGAGGT-3' in upstream of forward primer and 5'-727 GTGGCGGCCGCTCTATTA-3' in upstream of reverse primer) to facilitate the enzyme-free 728 cloning of the gene at the insertion site. Finally, the sequence of the recombinant plasmid was 729 designed by inserting the adapted codon sequences into pETite vector using SnapGene software 730 (from Insightful Science; available at snapgene.com). 731 23.
