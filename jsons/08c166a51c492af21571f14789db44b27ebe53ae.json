            "text": "1. Conditioning to Engraftment The duration of this period has become dynamic and depends on the conditioning regimen itself, the source and dose of stem cells infused and whether growth factors are used. It usually ranges from five (with nonmyeloablative transplants) to 30 days (with bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplants). The combination of profound granulocytopenia and mucositis with myeloablative conditioning makes the patient particularly vulnerable to bacterial and candidal infections. In addition, infection present in the transplant recipient pre-transplant may be amplified by the granulocytopenic state and deficiencies of T and B-cell numbers and function. Thus, control of pre-transplant infection is needed before initiating the conditioning regimen. Prior to engraftment (both with autologous and allogeneic transplants), approximately 50 percent of patients will have fever of unknown origin, with bloodstream infection in ~12.5 percent and pneumonia in \u223c10 percent. The risk of an invasive mold infection is related to the duration of neutropenia and the environmental strategy used in a transplant center. 2. Engraftment to Post-Transplant Day 100 During this time period viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the other herpes group viruses, are the major concerns. The occurrence, severity and treatment modalities selected for acute GVHD further modulates and increases the risk of herpesvirus infections, especially CMV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and invasive mold infections [8] [9] [10] [11] . 3. More than 100 Days Post-Transplant In the absence of GVHD, the incidence of infection decreases significantly, with varicella zoster virus (VZV), Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia (PCP) and pneumococcal infection being the primary problems of this time period. Routine use of prophylaxis, such as with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and acyclovir, significantly decreases the occurrence of PCP and herpesvirus infections, respectively. In addition, late or relapsing CMV infection may manifest during this time. If GVHD is present, it is typically treated with significant augmentation of immunosuppressive therapy such as with high-dose corticosteroids and monoclonal antibodies. Patients in this last category (GVHD under treatment) are at particular risk for invasive mold infection, CMV reactivation, PCP and other common and opportunistic pathogens.",

A prophylactic mode, in which antimicrobial therapy is prescribed to an entire population before an event to prevent clinically important infection. For such a strategy to be successful, the infection(s) being targeted must be important enough to justify the intervention, and the antimicrobial therapy prescribed must be nontoxic and inexpensive enough to justify the intervention. By far the most effective antimicrobial prophylactic strategy is low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which has virtually eliminated the occurrence of Pneumocystis jiroveci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia sp, and Toxoplasma gondii in patients who adhere to the regimen. Other prophylactic strategies commonly utilized in HSCT patients include acyclovir to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV reactivation, fluoroquinolones [5] to prevent gram-negative sepsis and fluconazole to prevent yeast infection. 3. An empiric mode, in which antimicrobial therapy is administered in response to a symptom complex. In this context, empiric antimicrobial therapy is initiated during the period of profound granulocytopenia in response to fever +/\u2212 rigors or subtle signs of sepsis (unexplained hypotension, tachypnea, an ongoing volume requirement, or acidosis). In the patient deemed not to be a therapeutic emergency, initial therapy is usually aimed at aerobic gramnegative bacilli (e.g., the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).",

The most common involved sites include blood stream (often catheter-related), lung, gastrointestinal tract and skin/soft tissue. The greatest rate of bacterial infections occur during the period prior to engraftment; this rate is a product of granulocytopenia, mucositis that permits the translocation of bacteria and yeast from the oral cavity and gut into circulation, and the presence of vascular access devices that traverse the skin and serve as direct conduits into the systemic circulation. Thus, the primary mucocutaneous barriers to infection are compromised, and the absence of granulocytes only amplifies the susceptibility of the patient [1, 4, 7] .",

However, significant concerns regarding this approach have been raised given that no mortality benefit has been demonstrated, the emergence of resistant organisms, and the impairment this widespread antimicrobial approach has on the use of quinolones in future oral outpatient management.

The traditional approach of a \u03b2-lactam (e.g., piperacillin) plus an aminoglycoside is still favored by some experts, although nephrotoxicity from the aminoglycoside has led to the trial of other approaches, including the substitution of a fluoroquinolone for the aminoglycoside, or the prescription of a single advanced spectrum drug such as ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem. If fluoroquinolone prophylaxis has been utilized, then its use as a therapeutic agent may be diminished. Empiric fluoroquinolone monotherapy is inferior to other regimens, and if pure aerobic gram-negative agents are utilized, (e.g., aztreonam, aminoglycosides) due to confirmed severe beta-lactam hypersensitivity, then the addition of empiric gram-positive coverage that targets aerobic and anaerobic streptococci of the gastrointestinal tract should be considered. Use of extended interval (once-daily dosing) aminoglycoside administration may be safer and as effective.",

            "text": "The second area of controversy is whether empiric gram-positive treatment should be initiated at the same time, given the preponderance of grampositive infection. As there is typically time to evaluate culture data and deploy targeted gram-positive antimicrobial therapy rather than empiricism, vancomycin should rarely be required empirically. Furthermore, empiric gram-positive coverage is not associated with better outcomes [21] . Indications for the immediate initiation of vancomycin as part of the empiric therapy regimen include the following [6, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] : catheter-related sepsis is likely because of evidence of infection at the insertion site (or within the tunnel), severe illness such as shock and/or respiratory distress are present, the patient is at particular risk for seeding of a prosthetic device (e.g., a prosthetic valve, a hip prosthesis, etc.), or the empiric gram-negative coverage exclusively covers aerobic gram-negative rods -such as the combination of aztreonam and gentamicin. Vancomycin or other anti-staphylococcal agents should be started if cultures become positive for gram-positive cocci. In our experience, vancomycin can be discontinued safely in patients in whom vancomycin was started empirically, but in whom blood cultures remain negative after 48 to 72 hours and there is no specific syndrome, such as cellulitis, that requires treatment with vancomycin. On the other hand, empirical treatment against gram-negative organisms should be continued until resolution of neutropenia, whether fevers resolve or not [22] . The emergence and persistence of multidrug-resistant organisms should guide local practice in a dynamic fashion.",

Nonantimicrobial-based strategies to prevent bacterial infections during the neutropenic period include the systematic use of hand hygiene and the use of mask and gloves by health care personnel and family members.

Patients with chronic GVHD are at risk for invasive infection from encapsulated organisms, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. It is postulated that the combination of B lymphocyte dysfunction secondary to the conditioning regimen and the effects of GVHD and its treatment have resulted in the loss and failure to develop an opsonizing antibody to these organisms, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, for at least one to two years post-transplant, HSCT patients have an inadequate response to pneumococcal vaccine. As IgG levels are often low for some time after HSCT, they should be routinely monitored, with replacement being considered when the IgG level falls below 500 mg/ml [25, 26] . In addition, antimicrobial prophylaxis, such as with low-dose trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (one single strength tablet daily for PCP prophylaxis), may afford further protection against this problem [1, 3] .",

            "text": "1. Latency Once infected with a herpesvirus, one is infected for life, with a circulating antibody (seropositivity) in the absence of active viral replication being the classic marker for latent infection. Reactivation from latency may be triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), with the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and proinflammatory prostaglandins also playing a role. Thus, the virus may be reactivated by such processes as sepsis, GVHD, allogeneic reactions, OKT3 and antilymphocyte globulin. Once a replicating virus is present, medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus and prednisone may significantly amplify the viral replication. 2. Cell Association These viruses are highly cell-associated, meaning that transmission occurs through intimate person-to-person contact, or transfusion or transplantation of latently or actively replicating cells from a seropositive donor. Humoral immunity is, hence, less important than cell-mediated immunity. Indeed, the key host defense is accomplished by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted, virus-specific, cytotoxic T cells, just that component of host defense most affected by GVHD and its treatment. 3. Oncogenesis Herpesviruses, such as EBV and HHV-8, play a direct role in oncogenesis-causing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and Kaposi's sarcoma, respectively. Herpesviruses may also play an indirect role in oncogenesis with symptomatic CMV disease, increasing the incidence of EBV-associated PTLD severalfold. 4. Indirect Effects In addition to the direct causation of infectious disease syndromes, human herpesviruses, particularly CMV, have indirect effects that are clinically important. It is believed that cytokines, chemokines and growth factors produced in response to viral replication may be responsible for these effects. They include, in addition to the modulation of oncogenesis, increasing the net state of immunosuppression so that the risk of opportunistic infection is increased. This last point is particularly important, as a variety of experiments have shown that GVHD and infection are closely linked by the production of these mediators. That is, there is a bidirectional trafficking of mediators between these two processes.",

            "text": "The clinically most important direct effects of CMV in the HSCT recipient are pneumonia and gastrointestinal disease. Before effective antiviral treatment became available, CMV pneumonia occurred in 20 to 30 percent of seropositive recipients and had an associated mortality around 80 percent [28] . CMV commonly causes fever in the absence of preemptive treatment, and end-organ disease (hepatitis, bone marrow dysfunction, retinitis, and encephalitis) may occur. Among allogeneic HSCT recipients, the risk of CMV reactivation (60-80%) and end-organ disease is greatest in the seropositive recipient who receives a graft from a CMV seronegative donor (CMV D\u2212/R+), likely due to the loss of native immunity during the transplant process and immune reconstitution with a CMV na\u00efve allograft [29, 30] . Patients who are CMV D+/R+ have CMV reactivation (50-60%) and disease risk that is similar to or slightly lower than that of the CMV D\u2212/R+ patient. Patients who are CMV D+/ R\u2212 have a lower risk of CMV infection (10-30%) and disease, but higher than CMV D\u2212/R\u2212 patients (<5%). The risk of CMV infection in this latter group has been greatly decreased by use of leukoreduced blood products or by exclusive use of CMV negative products when available [31] . The risks of CMV reactivation and disease among autologous HSCT recipients is minimal (<1%) [1, 4] . Another major risk factor for the development of CMV reactivation and disease is the occurrence, severity and treatment of acute GVHD [29, 30] . Other potential factors associated with an increased risk of CMV reactivation and disease are reception of T cell-depleted or cord blood allograft, whether the donor is unrelated or mismatched, or donated bone marrow (instead of peripheral stem cells), and whether the conditioning regimen was myeloablative [29, 32] . The most widely used therapy for clinical CMV disease is ganciclovir, which can be administered either intravenously or orally in the form of a prodrug, valganciclovir, with an acceptable bioavailability profile (~50-60%). Typically, the parenteral form is administered until the patient is able to tolerate oral therapy. Gastrointestinal absorption of valganciclovir, even in the setting of mild to moderate GI GVHD, has been demonstrated to be adequate [33, 34] . Duration of treatment depends on the clinical response and the nature of the recovery of native immune function. In the case of serious illness, particularly pneumonia, anti-CMV hyperimmune globulin can be considered as adjunctive therapy. Despite these efforts, the mortality from CMV pneumonia remains high. The major toxicity of ganciclovir is myelosuppression, so that great effort is placed in monitoring these patients closely and adjusting doses appropriately [1, 4] . Occasionally, G-CSF support may be required to preserve an acceptable neutrophil count and to allow adequate therapy of a serious CMV infection. While certain medications, such as ATG and OKT3, are likely to induce CMV reactivation, others like sirolimus may inhibit this [29] .",

Prophylaxis with ganciclovir from the time of engraftment until at least day 100 post-transplant has been studied in randomized trials [35, 36] . Although CMV viremia and disease were prevented, there was no overall benefit of this strategy due to secondary bacterial and fungal infections related to ganciclovir-induced neutropenia. Alternatively, a preemptive strategy is employed in which patients are monitored weekly for viremia through either a PCR assay for CMV DNA or an antigenemia assay. Positive results are linked to initiating ganciclovir or other antiviral drugs active against CMV. Typically, these assays turn positive several days to weeks prior to the onset of clinical disease, permitting the use of effective preemptive therapy [1, 4, 29, 33, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . A preemptive approach significantly decreases the amount of prophylactic medication used, thus minimizing medication-associated toxicity.",

The great majority of these patients had zoster, but approximately 20 percent had a more generalized process resembling primary varicella. A significant concern was visceral involvement in the setting of disseminated disease as well as neurologic complications such as myelitis or encephalitis [1, [45] [46] [47] [48] .

            "text": "HHV-6 is a \u03b2-herpesvirus (as is CMV) whose role in post-transplant complications is being defined. In the great majority of instances, HHV-6 primary infection occurs by the third year of life, with a seroprevalence rate of 90 percent at one year, and close to 100 percent at three years [49, 50] . The clinical effects associated with primary HHV-6 infection include exanthem subitum (roseola), and a form of encephalitis. In HSCT patients, bone marrow suppression, especially delayed platelet engraftment, and encephalitis have been associated with HHV-6 type B. The encephalitis typically occurs one to two months after transplantation and is associated with profound memory loss, especially short-term memory, and MRI changes in the mesial temporal lobes (limbic encephalitis) [51, 52] . The highest risk patients for this complication are male, umbilical cord blood recipients for whom the attack rate may be as high as 10 to 20 percent. Detecting HHV-6 DNA in the blood of allogeneic HSCT recipients is a common phenomenon occurring transiently in 40 to 60 percent of patients, yet encephalitis is a rather infrequent occurrence (1-2%). As obtaining brain biopsies is not usually feasible early after transplantation, the diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis is currently achieved by developing an acute limbic encephalitis syndrome, confirmed with MRI imaging of the brain and by the detection of HHV-6 in the CSF [52] . It remains unclear what the treatment of choice for this virus is. One approach that we currently favor is to use foscarnet. It is possible that anti-CMV preventative strategies with ganciclovir may have a beneficial effect on this virus as well [1, 53] .",

These infections can occur at any time in the post-transplant course, and can be acquired in the community or during hospitalization from infected staff, family and friends. Overall, an estimated 10 to 20 percent of HSCT patients will become infected in the first year posttransplant, with the potential for this figure to rise significantly in the setting of a community-wide outbreak [54] . The dilemma for the clinician is how to prevent these infections, as there is a far higher rate of progression to pneumonia (viral and/or bacterial or fungal superinfection), which carries a far higher morbidity and mortality than what is observed in the general population. In addition, antiviral therapy for these agents is in its infancy. It is important to attempt to make an etiologic diagnosis. Avoiding exposure to infected individuals by systematic infection control measures in both family members and friends, but most importantly in health care workers, is the best preventative strategy available [55] [56] [57] [58] .",

The illness begins with the signs and symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, sore throat and/or otitis media), that may progress to pneumonia, especially if the virus is acquired in the preengraftment phase. As with influenza, pneumonic syndromes can be due to RSV itself, but in our experience it is more frequently due to secondary bacterial and fungal infections. The advent of rapid RSV diagnosis by antigen detection in nasopharyngeal swabs has resulted in the recognition that RSV is a significant pathogen for both adults and children, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Optimal antiviral management, however, remains unclear. There are reports that aerosolized ribavirin +/\u2212 anti-RSV polyclonal or monoclonal antibody may have therapeutic benefit, but this remains unproven.

The impact of this virus on infected HSCT recipients is demonstrated by the following statistics: ~60 percent of the patients with influenza develop pneumonia and ~25 percent of patients with influenza pneumonia die of progressive respiratory failure. When influenza is identified as a pathogen, use of a neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamvir or zanamavir) or an amantadate (amantadine or rimanatine) should be considered. The neuraminidase inhibitors are attractive in this setting as they are effective against both influenza A and B and antiviral resistance occurs more slowly compared with amantadine use. Annual influenza vaccination should be considered, but its benefit is attenuated; indeed, it is probably fair to say that maximal benefit from vaccination occurs when the vaccine is administered to health care workers, family, friends and other contacts of the patient.

The overwhelming majority of cases are asymptomatic and require no intervention [62] . Occasionally the severity of hemorrhage or bladder-associated pain is so great that intervention is required.

Therapeutic options for adenovirus are limited. The role of the antiviral cidofovir is controversial with mixed results having been reported [63] . Decreasing immunusuppression and attempting reconstitution of the native host immune response is critical.

BK virus is associated with hemorrhagic cystitis in the early post-transplant period. This virus is commonly found in the urine and rarely requires any therapeutic intervention. JC virus is the etiologic agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) which is a rare, but severe post-transplant complication. PML involves the white matter and presents with focal neurologic symptoms associated with the specific area of the CNS where the lesion(s) occur. Diagnosis requires correlating the clinical presentation, radiographic findings (typically by contrast-enhanced MRI imaging) and CSF PCR results for JC virus. Control of JC virus is associated with an intact cell-mediated immune response. Therapy for polyomavirus infection is quite limited with minimizing immunsuppression, when possible, being critical. The role of cidofovir is controversial with mixed results being reported. The use of quinolones for BK viruria is controversial at best and we do not recommend this practice [66] .

The use of the HBV vaccine as a routine childhood immunization will likely decrease the number of chronically infected individuals over the next several decades. The advent of nucleic acid detection technology has allowed a more precise mechanism to detect active HBV replication compared with antigen-(for surface and e) only methods. For patients with evidence of prior HBV exposure (HBV core antibody positive), it is important to consider HBV reactivation in the setting of post-transplant liver dysfunction and to differentiate this from other causes such as hepatic GVHD or medication toxicity, although reactivation initially occurs in the setting of normal liver tests. The best strategy for surveillance post-transplantation remains to be defined. Some recommend routine surveillance for HBV reactivation post-transplantation, whereas others would suggest antiviral prophylaxis. It is important to be aware that old resolved infections, including those with hepatitis core and surface antibody, but without antigen or HBV DNA detected, are at risk for reactivation (seroreversion) post-transplantation, especially in the setting of high levels of immunosuppression [68, 69] . Several therapeutic options have become available over the last several years and include lamivudine [70] [71] [72] , adefovir [73] , entecavir [71, 72] and telbivudine. Other agents such as tenofovir and emtricitabine also have excellent anti-HBV activity.

Over several decades, chronic HCV infection is associated with progressive hepatic fibrosis, liver failure, and hepatoma. This process is accelerated in certain immunocompromised patients including HSCT recipients [74, 75] . It is important to assess patients for seropositivity to HCV prior to transplantation and in those who are found seropositive, to assess the HCV viral load, genotype and liver pathology. The presence of elevated liver enzymes in the setting of HCV before allogeneic HSCT has been associated with an increased incidence of VOD [76] . A more precise profiling of the HCV-infected patient, including liver biopsy, should be considered to better define the extent of the HCV-induced liver disease, and to optimize the conditioning regimen and frequency of surveillance posttransplantation. Treatment of HCV is limited and typically requires use of an interferon and ribavirin which are likely to be poorly tolerated in the early post-transplant setting. In patients who are infected, it is prudent to counsel them to avoid hepatotoxins, receive the hepatitis A and B vaccines, and minimize the risk of transmission to close contacts.",

Although there is the possibility that the portal of entry can be vascular access catheters, it is believed that translocation of Candida species across gut mucosa damaged by the pre-transplant conditioning regimen is the major route of access to the bloodstream in the granulocytopenic patient [77, 78] . In the past, C. albicans and C. tropicalis accounted for virtually all of the Candida bloodstream infections. The incidence of candidemia was \u223c11 to 16 percent (with a median time to onset of two weeks post-transplant), resulting in a high rate of tissue invasion and an attributable mortality of nearly 40 percent [79, 80] . With the introduction of empirical antifungal therapy or fluconazole prophylaxis (400 mg/day) during the preengraftment period, the incidence of candidemia has been significantly decreased, hepatosplenic candidiasis has become quite rare, and the attributable mortality has been significantly decreased. Fluconazole-resistant Candida sp, C. krusei and C. glabrata, have emerged as not uncommon causes of candidemia in HSCT patients, as have the other non-albicans Candida species [1, 4, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] .",

The importance of these mechanisms is demonstrated by the clustering of cases of invasive aspergillosis at two timepoints in the posttransplant course: preengraftment when profound granulocytopenia is present, with the incidence of invasive aspergillosis increasing steadily as the period of granulocytopenia is extended, and after the diagnosis of GVHD and the treatment of this adverse event. Indeed, these late cases of invasive aspergillosis have become more common than the preengraftment cases.

Before the availability of noninvasive fungal markers (galactomannan and \u03b2-glucan) and aggressive imaging with spiral chest computerized tomographic (CT) scanning, 50 percent or more of patients experience disseminated infection at the time of first diagnosis, accounting for the high mortality observed in allogeneic HSCT recipients.

Computerized tomographic scan of the chest in a patient with a \"halo sign\" due to invasive aspergillosis. Note that halo signs most commonly occur in granulocytopenic HSCT recipients with invasive aspergillosis. However, it must be emphasized that a halo sign is occasionally seen in patients with Nocardia, Scedosporium, Fusarium and other forms of pneumonia. The patient was treated with voriconazole monotherapy during neutropenia during consolidation chemotherapy for AML and his treatment was continued through allogeneic transplantation.

It is important to note that a high background rate of Candida infections was noted in both of these reports and may not represent the experience of other transplant centers. Echinocandins may be an alternative to fluconazole prophylaxis during this risk period [89] . The second common strategy is empiric antifungal therapy in neutropenic patients with persistent fever without a source, despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy for >96 hours [99, 100] . In this setting the primary concern is both Candida and invasive mold infection, especially Aspergillus [2] . The traditional antifungal therapy utilized as empiric therapy is an amphotericin product [101, 102] . Caspofungin use in this setting has become common because of the favorable side effect profile of this class of agents, but at the expense of a more limited fungal spectrum [90] . Other echinocandins (micafungin, anidulafungin) are likely to be similarly effective, but no randomized comparisons with these latest drugs have been performed. The role of voriconazole in this setting is controversial [102] .",

This includes avoiding gardening and soil exposures, mold exposures such as cleaning out damp basements or smoking marijuana, individuals with active respiratory infections, especially children, and avoiding enteric pathogens. Second, optimal treatment or monitoring for latent infections such as herpesviruses, hepatitis viruses and prior granulomatous diseases (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Those patients with a positive test for latent tuberculosis should receive secondary prophylaxis, which typically is begun within one month post-transplantation, after the acute regimen toxicities associated with transplantation have subsided, when screening and preventive treatment have not occurred previous to HSCT. The first line therapy for secondary prophylaxis is isoniazid for nine months. However, in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy alternative regimens need to be considered. Rifamycin-based regimens are difficult given the potential hepatotoxicity, as well as the significant drug interactions, especially with concomitant use of a calcineurin or an azole. A quinolone, such as levofloxacin, with ethambutol may be considered. When a mycobateriologically static regimen is chosen, the duration of therapy often must be extended with some using this combination for 18 months as secondary prophylaxis (Table 19-2) .",

If trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not tolerated due to significant renal dysfunction or bone marrow suppression, then alternative agents for PCP prophylaxis include dapsone, atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine; however, none of these second line agents afford the broad microbial protection which trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole affords. And lastly, herpes group viral prevention which should include acyclovir to prevent HSV and VZV and systematic monitoring for CMV, in the allogeneic setting, with early use of a CMV active antiviral if evidence for CMV activation or disease is observed. Prophylaxis must be re-assessed in the setting of persistent or augmented immunosuppression, such as in the setting of clinically significant GVHD, regardless of time since HSCT. Medication doses may need to be adjusted for renal dysfunction. * Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole affords modest protection for a broad array of potential environmental and community pathogens including: Nocardia sp, toxoplasmosis, pneumococci, H influenza, listeria, shigella, and slamonella sp. ** Alternatively preemptive monitoring with serial viral antigen or viral load assays can be considered. *** For those with evidence of prior HBV infection (e.g., Hepatitis B core antibody positive), consider monitoring HBV viral load for evidence of reactivation periodically. If reactivation is detected then consider treatment if persistent HBV viremia detected. Specific HBV antiviral therapy is discussed in the text. **** Pre-transplant secondary prophylaxis for MTb is preferred. ***** Decision for systemic azole prophylaxis should be based on local epidemiology of invasive fungal infections. Consider posaconazole prophylaxis in the setting of significant GVHD (e.g., Grade 3 or 4) and its therapy. Drug interactions must be carefully managed both with initiation and cessation of azole therapy.",

            "text": "An important aspect of antimicrobial therapy in the HSCT patient is the management of drug interactions, especially between antimicrobial agents (e.g., azoles, macrolides) and the immunosuppressive medications (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus) used to prevent and treat GVHD. There are three important categories of interaction to pay particular attention to, two of which are related to the major route of drug metabolism for the calcineurin inhibitors, hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymatic metabolism. These interactions are as follows: 1) certain antimicrobial agents (most notably the macrolides [eryth romycin>clarithromycin>azithromycin] and the azoles [ketoconazole>itraco nazole>voriconazole>fluconazole]) will downregulate the metabolism of the calcineurin inhibitors, resulting in elevated blood levels of active drug, and an increased risk of nephrotoxicity, as well as over-immunosuppression and an increased incidence of opportunistic infection; 2) certain antimicrobial agents (such as rifampin and rifabutin) upregulate metabolism of the calcineurin inhibitors, leading to a fall in blood levels and an increased risk of GvHD, and 3) therapeutic blood levels of the calcineurin inhibitors, when combined with such drugs as amphotericin B, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, can cause significant renal toxicity.",

            "text": "HSCT has become one of the great success stories of modern medicine. It is the therapy of choice for an increasing number of conditions, including a variety of cancers, bone marrow failure states, congenital immunodeficiencies, metabolic disorders and even as a means for introducing new genes. The major hurdle in most of these attempts, however, remains infection. Bacterial and fungal sepsis, as well as herpes group viral infection and community-acquired respiratory virus infection threaten the well-being of these patients. There are two phases of the post-transplant course when the patient is at particular risk: preengraftment with profound granulocytopenia and mucositis, and post-engraftment when GVHD and its therapy render the patient vulnerable to both fungal and viral infection. New preventative strategies are being formulated involving both prophylaxis and preemptive therapy. Similarly, new non-culture diagnostic approaches that rely on antigen detection or PCR detection of microbial DNA are being developed. New therapies, both antiviral and antifungal, have emerged. These should prompt much more effective prevention and therapeutic strategies. ",

This table outlines the time period of the major host deficits and infections which occur during allogeneic HSCT in relation to when targeted pathogen-specific prophylactic, preemptive and empiric therapies are deployed. Risk for infectious complications are temporally dependent and are significantly decreased in the setting of prophylactic, preemptive or empiric therapy The risk of certain infections after transplantation is highly associated with ongoing immunologic manipulation as seen with the therapy for GVHD (linkages noted by vertical arrows). CVL = central venous line, GVHD = Graft-versus-Host disease, GNR = gram-negative rods, GPC = gram-positive cocci, PCP = Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, CMV = cytomegalovirus, HHV-6 = human herpes virus 6, HSV = herpes simplex virus, and VZV = varicella zoster virus. Standard prophylactic considerations in this context include: GNR= fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; Candida sp = fluconazole; PCP = trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone, dapsone, or pentamidine; and HSV/VZV = acyclovir. Standard empiric therapeutic considerations in this setting include: GNR= ceftazidime, piperacillin/gentamicin, or imipenem; aspergillus/molds/candida = amphotericin preparations or extended spectrum azoles, and CMV = IV ganciclovir, valganciclovir or preemptive monitoring (by antigenemia or PCR)",
