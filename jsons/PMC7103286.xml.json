Likewise, the enteric AH187-E and its respiratory counterpart AH187-R viruses were distinguished by 149 nucleotide differences (Table 2\n), of which 76 of the 149 nucleotide mutations were non-synonymous. Pair-wise comparison among the 6 genomes was performed and divergent nucleotide positions are summarized in Table 3\n. The calculated number of nucleotide and non-synonymous mutations included the ambiguous nucleotides and amino acids. Nucleotide symbols beyond A, T, G, and C represent ambiguity nucleotide positions: R = A or G, Y = C or T, M = A or C, K = G or T, W = A or T. Only 1 common mutation was found in the two pairs at either nucleotide or amino acid level (nt position 27947 resulting in a common T to I mutation from BCoV-E to BCoV-R in the 4.8 kDa NSP). The fact that significant numbers of nucleotide polymorphisms were found to exist in respiratory and enteric BCoV strains from the same animals indicates the presence of an intra-host quasispecies. These mutations were scattered throughout the entire genome, but the spike gene had higher mutation number to gene length ratios relative to most of the other gene regions (mutation n\n = 31 in spike gene out of total 123 nt differences for AH65-E/AH65-R pair and n\n = 30 out of total 149 nt differences for AH187-E/AH187-R pair). This suggests a higher selective pressure on the spike gene and supports evidence from other CoVs on the role of this protein in determining host and tissue tropism (Sanchez et al., 1992, Sanchez et al., 1999, Schickli et al., 2004, Thackray and Holmes, 2004).",

Irresolvable sequence ambiguities in otherwise clean sequence data can represent the presence of multiple RNA species present in a sample. The sequence generated during this study was derived from RT-PCR and thus represents a description of a population of viruses present in the strain at the time of purification. Sequence ambiguities were found at 7 and 84 nucleotide positions in the genomes of AH65-R and AH187-E, respectively, suggesting the existence of intra-isolate quasispecies of BCoV in the same animal.",

For example, exposure to and the mixing of respiratory and enteric BCoV strains under field conditions and within a host may represent one source for mixtures of different viral populations. The possibility also exists that the calves swallowed respiratory secretions and hence respiratory viruses were introduced orally into the intestinal tract. Likewise, calves' nostrils are also possibly contaminated with enteric viruses by direct contact and inhalation of feces. Formation of intra-isolate viral quasispecies highlights the complexity of BCoV evolution under field conditions. The present study did not show a tendency of intra-isolate quasispecies formation of BCoV-E strains compared to BCoV-R strains. Although the AH187-E strain had more ambiguities than the AH65-R strain (84 nt vs. 7 nt), neither the AH65-E nor the AH187-R had any ambiguities. Our quasispecies data cannot solely be explained by potential physical contamination between respiratory and enteric sample materials because 1 and 6 nt ambiguities were also found in the AH65-E-TC and AH65-R-TC isolates, respectively after tissue culture passage. The single ambiguity at nucleotide position 2086 of the AH65-E-TC apparently occurred after tissue culture adaptation and plaque purification (Table 1). Similarly, ambiguous positions at nucleotides 11,259, 11,282, and 11,322 of AH65-R-TC were observed after tissue culture passage and plaque purification. The intra-host BCoV genetic diversities and the intra-isolate ambiguities discovered in the tissue culture BCoV isolates indicate that the mixtures of genetically different viruses were formed intrinsically during viral replication within the host or developed after tissue culture adaptation.",

            "text": "The AH65-E-TC isolate showed 104 nt mutations from the parental AH65-E strain after 15 passages in cell culture plus 1 plaque purification. In contrast, the genome of the AH65-R-TC isolate changed at only 8 nucleotide positions from the AH65-R strain after a similar number of cell culture passages (14 tissue culture passages and 1 plaque purification). These findings suggest that enteric BCoV strains are more prone to change than respiratory BCoV strains during cell culture adaptation and passage. Unexpectedly, of the 104 mutations observed in the AH65-E-TC, 86 mutated to be the same as the corresponding nucleotides of the AH65-R isolate (Table 1). As a result, the AH65-E-TC genetically resembled the AH65-R strain more than the parent AH65-E strain. Particularly noteworthy, whereas the spike gene of the AH65-E differed from that of the AH65-R at 31 nucleotide positions, there was only one nucleotide difference in spike genes between the AH65-E-TC isolate and the AH65-R strain (Table 1). This is surprising because the HRT-18 cells used for in vitro viral adaptation and passage are human rectum epithelial cells and therefore are of intestinal and not respiratory origin. However, the AH65-E-TC isolate still differed from the AH65-R strain at 48 nucleotides with 37 of these divergences located in ORF1a and 1b genes. The latter substantial genomic differences argue against the AH65-E-TC isolate being an AH65-R variant that arose from contamination during the process of tissue culture adaptation and passage. The data from these isolates suggest that similar evolutionary processes may have occurred in vitro during BCoV adaptation to cell culture as those happening in vivo during adaptation from enteric to respiratory tropism. Only the AH65-E-TC and AH65-R-TC pair was selected initially for sequencing to see if they will be any significant mutations in the genome of enteric and respiratory BCoV strains after tissue culture passage. Given the interesting trend of mutations observed in the AH65-E-TC and AH65-R-TC genomes, sequencing of the other enteric and respiratory BCoV pair (e.g. AH187-E-TC and AH187-R-TC) will be attempted in the future to confirm if similar mutations occur in AH187-E-TC that mimic the AH187-R strain sequence. However, differences in the number and trend of mutations between AH187-E/AH187-R and AH65-E/AH65-R strains after tissue culture passage are expected based on the divergence of their genomes. In addition, it is possible that certain BCoV strains may require more cumulative passages in tissue culture than others to achieve significant genetic mutations, tropism shifts, or changes in virulence. Nevertheless, our observation that BCoV-E gained genetic mutations resembling the sequence of BCoV-R after tissue culture passage is consistent with that found for other members of the coronavirus family. For example, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains after 60 to 115 continuous tissue passages may lose their enteric tropism and gain respiratory tropism (Harada et al., 1969, Zhang et al., 2007).",

In general, biological, antigenic, and genetic differences were found between BCoV-R and BCoV-E (Gelinas et al., 2001a, Gelinas et al., 2001b, Hasoksuz et al., 1999, Lin et al., 2002). However, other investigators did not find consistent differences in biologic properties between BCoV-R and BCoV-E strains (Reynolds et al., 1985, Zhang et al., 1994a). The inconsistent results are partially ascribed to the fact that the BCoV strains compared varied widely in origin or year of isolation; for example, comparisons between BCoV-R and BCoV-E strains have often been compromised when viruses were isolated from different animals at different times (Reynolds et al., 1985). To accurately define tropism determinants of BCoV-R and BCoV-E, a systematic investigation of the complete genome sequences of BCoV-R and BCoV-E strains isolated concurrently from the same animals and examined both prior to and after cell culture adaptation is necessary.",

Chouljenko et al.

However, in that study the original BCoV samples were subjected to multiple cell culture passages and plaque purifications before sequencing. Such manipulations have the potential to cause genetic changes in BCoV genomes as evidenced in our study.

In that study, the S1 protein was found almost identical to each other between the concurrent enteric and respiratory strains except for one and two amino acid differences identified for the AH65-E/AH65-R pair and the AH187-E/AH187-R pair, respectively. Those findings are consistent with the observations in the present study that the S gene sequence of the AH65-E strain after tissue culture adaptation and passage closely resembled that of the AH65-R strain. However, discrepancies in amino acid residues at certain positions were found in the S1 region of previous sequences and present sequences and no nucleotide ambiguity positions were observed in that region in the previous study. The sequence discrepancy and lack of ambiguity positions likely reflect the fact that the viruses in our previous study were at different cell culture passage levels and were sequenced immediately after the plaque purification.",

            "text": "It is widely speculated that the spike protein of CoV is the major determinant for tropism. The spike gene of TGEV was identified as the determinant for enteric tropism (Sanchez et al., 1999). Mutations at two nucleotides, nt positions 214 and 655, in the spike gene of TGEV can potentially cause a shift from enteric to respiratory tropism (Ballesteros et al., 1997). We did not observe mutations at nt positions 214 and 655 in the spike gene (corresponding to nt 23,848 and 24,289 in the genome, respectively) of AH65-E/AH65-R and AH187-E/AH187-R strains, suggesting that determinants for enteric to respiratory tropism shifts may be different between the group 1 TGEV CoV and the group 2 BCoVs. Chouljenko et al. (1998) proposed amino acid 769 immediately downstream of the cleavage site (764\u2013768) and amino acid 1026 of the spike protein as two critical residues responsible for respiratory tropism of BCoV. In our BCoV-E and BCoV-R pairs, no amino acid difference was found at these two positions, suggesting that the amino acid positions 769 and 1026 are not relevant to tropism shifts for our strains. Our sequence analysis cannot pinpoint specific amino acid residue determinants for tropism because the enteric strains differed from respiratory strains at multiple positions. Analysis of the two pairs of viruses did not identify many common genetic changes between BCoV-E and BCoV-R strains except for a shared C to T mutation at nt 27,947 resulting in aa T to I mutation in the 4.8 kDa non-structural protein. This mutation was not among the 107 genomic mutations observed between the respiratory and enteric BCoV pair LUN/ENT (Chouljenko et al., 2001). Further study is needed to verify the exact function of this mutation by reverse genetics and animal studies. However, it is likely that for BCoV tissue tropism, shifts are determined by multiple factors involving a combination of genetic mutations. Others observed a truncated 4.9 kDa non-structural protein of 29 aa in BCoV-R strains instead of 43 aa for BCoV-E strains and suggested that this protein could be involved in determining respiratory tropism (Gelinas et al., 2001b, Vijgen et al., 2006). But this hypothesis also has not been experimentally proven. Our sequence data indicated that all respiratory and enteric BCoVs have the truncated 4.9 kDa non-structural protein of 29 aa, suggesting that truncation of this protein is not necessarily needed for enteric to respiratory tropism shift. Involvement of mutations in this protein in tropism shift remains to be verified.",

            "text": "Our analysis has defined the presence of multiple BCoV species present in the same animal. We detected evidence for intra-host quasispecies (significant sequence variation between enteric and respiratory strains) and also intra-isolate quasispecies (sequence ambiguities within the same strains). The comprehensive dissection of BCoV quasispecies will aid in an understanding of BCoV population dynamics and pathogenesis. The presence of intra-host and intra-isolate BCoV quasispecies suggests that BCoV evolves through selection pressures working on a quasispecies basis. Recent evidence has suggested that many RNA viruses exist as quasispecies in vivo and in vitro (Domingo et al., 1998). Viral quasispecies are characterized by continuous genetic variation within virus populations which is a result of the high error rates of most RNA virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Quasispecies evolution can occur in individual hosts, geographically related areas, or different temporal phases during the course of infection. Examples of RNA viruses with distinctive quasispecies include bovine viral diarrhea virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis A virus (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2006, Jerzak et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2002). Rapid evolutionary change allows viruses to adapt to changing micro or macro environments, increase viral fitness, and maintain balance with host immune systems in order to achieve long-term survival in nature. It is believed that pathogenesis is determined by viral quasispecies rather than by the action of a single genotype (Vignuzzi et al., 2006). Increasing evidence indicates that quasispecies development may lead to the selection of virulent viruses and to the emergence of new viral species (Domingo, 1997, Domingo et al., 2006, Holland et al., 1982). Research suggests that SARS-CoV, a newly emerging human CoV, exists as quasispecies in individual patients (Xu et al., 2004) and a genetically diverse population of SARS-like coronaviruses are present in geographically closely related Chinese horseshoe bats (Ren et al., 2006).",

Based on sequence analysis, researchers have shown the potential zoonotic transmission of a BCoV to human beings (Vijgen et al., 2005) and previously confirmed the isolation of a bovine-like CoV from a child with diarrhea (Zhang et al., 1994b). Moreover the bovine-like, human CoV isolate infected and caused disease in gnotobiotic calves (Han et al., 2006).
