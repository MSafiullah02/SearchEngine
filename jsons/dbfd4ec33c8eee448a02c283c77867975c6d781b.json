We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patient encounters for select emergent or urgent diagnoses at a large tertiary-care academic medical center in Boston. Inpatient diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and outpatient but urgent diagnoses included new referrals for breast and hematologic malignancies.",

After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-indifferences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P<0.001) (Table) . In the ambulatory setting, there was a reduction in referrals for breast cancer and hematologic cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance until the month after the onset of the pandemic. Our findings suggest an urgent need for public health messaging to ensure that patients continue to seek care for acute emergencies. In addition, decisions by health systems regarding when to reinitiate non-emergent care should carefully factor in the harms of delayed diagnosis and treatment occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition, decisions by health systems regarding when to reinitiate non-emergent care should carefully factor in the harms of delayed diagnosis and treatment occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
