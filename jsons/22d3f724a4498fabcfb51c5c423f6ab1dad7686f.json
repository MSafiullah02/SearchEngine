Italy represented the first country forced to face this emergency. The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the healthcare system and on the economy has been very important so far, with consequences that probably will affect these two sectors for a long time. The emergency has put a strain on the health systems of the various countries, both for the growing demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and for the increasing number of patients suffering from less severe disease that needs to be managed in the hospitals. Even though orthopedics does not represent a branch directly involved in the management of the emergency in the first lines, it has experienced the spread of the pandemic and the changes that this entailed for the hospital systems as well. Moreover, depending on the situations in the various countries and in the different hospital contexts, many orthopedic surgeons have been involved in the management of patients with COVID-19. In Italy, this has been due both to the necessary management of the orthopedic emergencies including musculoskeletal injuries and to the fact that in several real emergency scenarios, the relative lack of human resources and the high number of nonorthopaedic patients with COVID-19 made it necessary to involve orthopedic surgeons as medical doctors for the management of less serious patients with COVID in support of clinicians. As a matter of fact, in several areas of our country, namely some provinces of the Lombardy region, the number of cases has been remarkably high and the available health system resources have been soon used at full capacity.",

Therefore, it is clear that elective orthopedic surgery has been affected by the outbreak, not only because the use of health system resources has been focused on handling the epidemic but also because there is a concrete risk of not being able to ensure the appropriate safety for patients in such a situation both for decreased staff resources and for limited resources and equipment to be used and stocked for the emergency. For these reasons, it is possible that operations on patients who are at higher surgical risk and those deemed as nonurgent might be postponed. Moreover, it is possible that measures implemented by the authorities, the travel restrictions and even the emotional concerns lead patients to be less inclined to accept elective surgeries in this period. Joint arthroplasties are perhaps one of the very fields in which these conditions may occur together in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition, the data about patients with SARS-CoV2 undergoing TJAs can certainly underestimate the real numbers because most of the patients included were not tested for SARS-CoV2 at all. Indeed, it is possible that a certain amount of asymptomatic patients has been admitted and discharged from the hospital without any suspicion of disease. Nasopharyngeal swabbing for all patients admitted to the hospital was introduced as a standard practice only at week 5 of the study period. In addition, the consequences of the pandemic on our practice represent the context of a specific time frame. Indeed these data come from a specialized center and are not immediately generalizable to other working realities. The fact that Lombardy was the first and worst affected region from the virus in Italy and western countries should also be taken into account. Furthermore, a selection bias toward patients at lower risk of complications could have influenced the results. However, clinical outcomes and complications were not included in the present study, which aimed primarily to report the influence of the pandemic on the number of procedures performed. In addition, outpatient TJAs are not common in our country and have not been reported in this series. This practice together with fast-track protocols could represent a suitable option for patients when limiting the hospital stay to the minimum could represent a reasonable answer to the need for limiting inpatient capacity of the hospitals. However, efforts of our institution for implementing enhanced recovery after surgery protocols are worth considering. This is confirmed by the decreased number of patients requiring inpatient rehabilitation in 2020 compared with that of the previous year.",
