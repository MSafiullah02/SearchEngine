Generally speaking, in the event of a disaster the role of the military has become subsidiary to that of the organizations whose mission is the defence and protection of the civilians. However, the specific threat posed by biological agents (and chemical or nuclear weapons) dictates that the military apparatus be ready to face it, so it maintains specialized units for NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) defence, and a national centre for research and specific training, which is done at the Nubich grounds, near Rieti. The centre runs courses for the personnel of all the armed forces, the national and local police corps, the Italian Red Cross, the firemen, the SSN, and the railway and port authorities. The centre, which participates in international working groups, develops policies, procedures, and guidelines for the integrated response to NBCR emergencies. Although subsidiary, the role of the Army remains essential, on account of its logistics and the capacity to mobilize its manpower, including its specialized medical and engineer corps (Fig. 13.1). One particular unit, the 7th Regiment \u201cCremona\u201d, is fully dedicated to NBC defence; the regiment has specialized units for the delimitation of the affected area and for the decontamination of people and materials. Regarding the biological hazards, it is equipped with a mobile laboratory capable of molecular detection of biological agents, isolator tents, and ambulances.\n",

Human cases from animal contacts have declined so much that the basic public health curricula have given less and less attention to it, relegating anthrax to be dealt with in the occupational medicine courses. Still in the 1960s a standard treatise of hygiene [27] gave a full education of anthrax and its control. Sophomore medical students exercised with Bacillus anthracisculture, guinea pig inoculation, and post-mortem dissection. Veterinarians on the field could perform the Ascoli reaction to diagnose anthrax in the carrions. And all provincial public health laboratories routinely tested for it, which in the Italian language had always been named carbonchio. In time, provincial health laboratories were dismantled, and slowly entire cohorts of MDs were formed who only had a cursory knowledge of carbonchio, even less of antrace,as the media started to call it. Hospital and territorial laboratories gradually gave up the traditional methods of diagnosis, and when the anthrax letter scares occurred, the best that could be done was to adopt a minimal guideline to safeguard first line officers.",
