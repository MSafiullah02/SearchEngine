            "text": "There are approximately 1200 bat species in the order Chiroptera, and these collectively act as reservoir hosts for a number of important viral zoonoses (Calisher et al. 2006; Luis et al. 2013). Bats are the natural host for lyssaviruses and are also the primary reservoirs for filoviruses, henipaviruses and SARS\u2010like coronaviruses (Halpin et al. 2000; Badrane & Tordo 2001; Li et al. 2005; Towner et al. 2009). The emergence of viral zoonoses from bats often has drastic consequences, such as the >150 human deaths associated with Nipah virus (NiV) emergence in Malaysia in 1999 (Chua et al. 2000). The trigger for initial emergences and drivers of exceptional increases in spillover frequency, such as the dramatic increase in Hendra virus spillover events in 2011 (Field et al. 2012), are often unknown and difficult to determine with so few events. However, bat\u2010derived viral zoonoses that do cause recurrent spillover events (such as henipaviruses and Marburg virus) often have a seasonal pattern (Luby et al. 2009; McFarlane, Becker & Field 2011). It is possible that this is related to seasonal changes in contact rates between reservoir and spillover hosts (e.g. animal stocking densities and caving tourism), but this has not been shown for Hendra or Marburg viruses (McFarlane, Becker & Field 2011; Amman et al. 2012). In the latter case, seasonal changes in zoonotic Marburg virus infections are suggested to be directly related to altered viral excretion from reservoir hosts (Amman et al. 2012). To continue exploration of these possibilities with the aim of anticipating spillover events, we need to understand the factors driving viral infection dynamics in bats.",

            "text": "Studies to date on the viral infection dynamics of various viruses in bats have revealed that some aspects may be near\u2010universal, regardless of the virus\u2013host system examined. For example, the infection status of bat populations has been shown to be affected by season for henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses (Breed et al. 2011; George et al. 2011; Amman et al. 2012; Drexler et al. 2012a). This is likely because, as for many other wildlife classes (Hosseini, Dhondt & Dobson 2004; Altizer et al. 2006), bat life cycles are highly seasonal, with tightly synchronized breeding, hibernacula formation and migrations that will drive epidemiology by controlling key factors such as contact rates and the introduction of susceptible animals (George et al. 2011; Drexler et al. 2012a). This is supported by studies which show that the infection and immunological status of individual bats are affected by age, breeding phase and nutritional stress for some viruses (Gloza\u2010Rausch et al. 2008; Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011). Further aspects of individual virus infection, such as maternal antiviral antibodies and persistent infection of individuals, likely affect infection dynamics in bats (Plowright et al. 2011) as in other systems (Kallio et al. 2006, 2010). The commonalities observed across different virus and bat\u2013host relationships, and the challenge of fully characterizing the infection dynamics of a single pathogen\u2013host system, make selecting a disease model for detailed study appropriate.",

            "text": "Hendra and Nipah viruses (in the genus Henipavirus) represent an important and useful model for the study of viral infection dynamics in bats. These paramyxoviruses cause fatal respiratory and encephalitic disease in a wide range of susceptible spillover hosts (including humans), while bats are apparently clinically unaffected by infection (Murray et al. 1995; Chua et al. 2000; Halpin et al. 2000). Consequently, henipaviruses must be worked with in highly rated biosecure (PC4) laboratories. These viruses cause recurrent disease outbreaks in Bangladesh and Australia (Luby et al. 2009; McFarlane, Becker & Field 2011; Field et al. 2012; Lo et al. 2012), and are of potential concern to a much greater geographical area with evidence of infection being near\u2010universally distributed throughout reservoir hosts in the Old World (Reynes et al. 2005; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2005; Sendow et al. 2006; Iehle et al. 2007; Hayman et al. 2008; Li et al. 2008). In addition to their continued clinical relevance, they are harboured by bats in the family Pteropodidae: reservoir hosts that are large enough to tolerate repeated serum sampling at practicable volumes and, as frugivores, relatively easy to maintain in captivity.",

Demographic analysis of data from serial cross\u2010sectional sampling suggest that antihenipavirus maternal antibodies exist, that the viruses are horizontally transmitted among populations and that pregnancy and lactation may affect serological status (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011). More recently, a study into a very small, closed island population of bats showed population\u2010level persistence of henipaviral infection (Peel et al. 2012). This is inconsistent with traditional paramyxovirus epidemiology theory, where large populations are considered to be necessary for infection maintenance (Pomeroy, Bjornstad & Holmes 2008; Plowright et al. 2011). In order to investigate these inferences from field observations and accurately measure infection parameters for practical and theoretical studies, as well as to determine possible mechanisms of persistence, it is necessary to reliably, repeatedly and comprehensively sample individuals in a closed study population.",

            "text": "The resampling rates and closure of a study population to new infection required to demonstrate these effects are difficult to achieve in the wild. Old World fruit bat populations are often migratory and/or nomadic and extremely numerous (up to millions of individuals), making recapture unlikely (Hayman et al. 2012b). Opportunistic sampling through wildlife rehabilitation centres and zoological enclosures is complicated by the rolling entry of bats of unknown infection status (Field 2005; Rahman et al. 2010; Sohayati et al. 2011), and experimental infections are often of test subjects with unknown historic or current infection status (and the added complications of working with PC4\u2010classified agents on often\u2010protected test species) (Williamson et al. 1998; Middleton et al. 2007; Halpin et al. 2011). For these reasons, a purpose\u2010built facility of newly captive, breeding African straw\u2010coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum), naturally infected with, as yet unknown, henipavirus(es) was used to observe henipavirus antibody dynamics in chiropteran hosts over a 30\u2010month period.",

The facility prevented contact with other animals through ground\u2010level cladding, second\u2010layering of mesh walls and ceiling (Fig. 1b) and a solid roof. Between July 2009 and January 2010, the facility was populated by three cohorts (1\u20133, Table 1) totalling 77 wild E. helvum of admixed age and sex. These bats were captured from a large seasonal population in the grounds of 37 Military hospital in Accra, Ghana (Hayman et al. 2012b). This wild population is known to be infected with henipaviruses (Hayman et al. 2008). Continued identification of individuals was ensured by subcutaneous passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag implantation in each bat and also the use of ball\u2010bearing necklaces carrying marked stainless steel butt\u2010end rings (Bat ID, Table S1) on fully\u2010grown bats. The sex and age at entry of each bat were recorded according to the following criteria: fully\u2010grown bats with secondary sexual characteristics (descended testes or previously suckled nipples) were deemed \u226524 months of age and termed adults (A); bats not fully\u2010grown were assumed born in the previous breeding season (i.e. <12 months old) and termed juveniles (JUV). Finally, bats fully\u2010grown but with no secondary sexual characteristics were classified as sexually immature (SIM) and as having been born in the penultimate breeding season (i.e. between 12 and 24 months old). Two further entry cohorts totalling 33 E. helvum were born in the facility and termed \u2018born in captivity\u2019 (BIC). Cohort 4 (born in 2010) resulted from wild matings, and Cohort 5 (born in 2011) resulted from captive matings (Table S1). The age of bats < 24 months old was inferred from a presumed birth date of April 1st each year. This date was based on observations in the captive population and the local wild population (Hayman et al. 2012b). Bats exited the study through mortality on known dates (n = 12) or presumed dates where they were unaccounted for over a period of \u22653 sampling intervals (n = 11, Table S1). This time interval was selected as bats missing for only two events had eventually been resampled.",

Comparatively, at the final time point of the study (17th January 2012), juvenile seroprevalence was significantly (\u03c72 test: P < 0\u00b705) higher, at ~60%, whereas seroprevalences in older groups were equivalent (Fig. 3).

Four of these seven bats seroconverted between 16 and 22 months of age, with matAb\u2010negative bats seroconverting younger and to a greater proportion than matAb\u2010positive bats (Fig. 5, Table 2). Secondly, bats that entered the study in January 2010 as 9\u2010month old, wild\u2010captured juveniles (observed to 34 months of age) were also observed to seroconvert. Of the eight bats that entered the study as juveniles, six seroconverted between 16 and 24 months of age, with a further one seroconverting at 28\u201334 months of age at the end of the study (Table 3). One female wild\u2010caught juvenile (BatID: A098) seroconverted at 18 months of age, and then again at 24 months of age (Table 3), the latter event being timed with a broader trend observed in adult females (more below). Notably, the only wild\u2010caught juvenile that did not seroconvert (BatID: A112) was the only one with detectable (possibly maternal) antibodies on entry (Table 3). The third opportunity to observe seroconversions in young bats was the 10 month period following the birth of the 2011 cohort (Table 2). Thus, including the seronegative pup born to a seropositive dam described in the last section, a total of 12 seroconversions in subadult bats were observed throughout the study period. These seroconversions were concentrated around two time points (March 2011 and January 2012, Fig. 6).",

This model demonstrated a relative increase (1\u00b79\u2010fold, 95%CI 1\u00b76\u20132\u00b72) in antibody concentration in individual adult females during the pregnancy/lactation season (P < 0\u00b701, Table 4).

            "text": "Before discussing the serological results of this study, it is worth considering what is (and is not) known about the virus in question. No henipavirus has yet been isolated from Africa, so the preference to work within a fully characterized host\u2013pathogen system could not be fulfilled here. However, despite the complex relationship between bats and paramyxoviruses, some inferences about the virus (or viruses) likely responsible for inducing the production of these antibodies can be made. Fragments of many henipa\u2010like viruses have been detected in this bat species (Drexler et al. 2009, 2012b; Baker et al. 2012a). Among these, however, we believe only one, or potentially a very small number of closely related viruses are responsible for the production of antibodies detected using the Luminex\u2010NiVsG assay. The evidence for this is that antibodies detected by this assay correlate well with HeV and NiV neutralizing activity in this, and other bat species (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2010, 2013; Peel et al. 2012, 2013), whereas antibodies against the recently identified Cedar virus (CedPV, the third henipavirus), however, are cross\u2010reactive, but not cross\u2010neutralizing with HeV and NiV (Marsh et al. 2012). This suggests that the virus under study here should have a closer relationship with HeV and NiV than CedPV does. This criterion is only filled by two of the multitude of henipavirus\u2010like sequence fragments detected in E. helvum (Fig. S4). Although our extensive efforts to detect a true African henipavirus have been unsuccessful (Baker et al. 2012a,b, 2013), we are confident that the antibody response demonstrated here is directed against one or very few closely related, true henipaviruses.",

Here, we set a relatively low threshold for seropositivity to incorporate non\u2010neutralizing reactivity. Both laboratory and field studies suggest that bats may produce low affinity but broadly reactive antibodies (Bratsch et al. 2011; Muller et al. 2012; Baker, Schountz & Wang 2013) and that lower thresholds for seropositivity are appropriate (Peel et al. 2013). This is also supported by evidence from this study, where very low reactivity samples (i.e. between 2 and 3 mAb m102\u00b74CEs) comprised clearly recognizable immunological trends (e.g. antibody decay and seroconversion). The combined power of the assay and the quantitation method used here enabled the detection of subtle, but significant, changes in antibody concentration in individuals. Notably, although this threshold reliably indicates the presence of antibodies, this is irrespective of their ability to protect individuals from infection, which is discussed further below.",

(Epstein et al. 2013). Correlations in both the serostatus and antibody concentrations of dam\u2010pup pairs indicated that matAbs were present, with pups having slightly higher concentrations than their dams, as in other matAb systems (Lefvert 1998). That neonatal antibodies were the IgG isotype and universally declined in subsequent samplings provided further evidence of their likely maternal origin. Furthermore, these maternal antibodies appeared to offer protection against infection (surrogated in this study by seroconversion). This was shown by the seroconversion of young bats following the decline of maternal antibodies (between 6 and 12 months of age). Bats born seronegative were more likely to have seroconverted by the end of the study, and seroconversion happened at a younger age compared with bats born seropositive. Collectively, this evidence suggests an uncomplicated system, where antibodies in neonates are maternally derived, are protective against infection until their decay, upon which young are susceptible to infection via horizontal transmission.",

Here, two pups had a serostatus that differed from their dams. Being born in different years with repeatable laboratory results, these likely represent true observations. The seronegative pup born to a seropositive dam was not sampled until 3 months of age (equivalent to 1\u00b77 matAb half\u2010lives as estimated here) and later was the earliest pup in the study to seroconvert, so it is possible it was born with a low level of matAb that was not observed due to delayed sampling. In the alternate pair (the seropositive pup born to a seronegative dam), the pup had the lowest antibody concentration at birth of any neonate in the study and, following waning of these antibodies, similarly seroconverted comparatively young for its birth cohort (i.e. seropositive bats born in 2010, Table 2, Fig. 5). Given the low antibody concentration in the neonate and that neonatal antibody levels were typically ~35% higher than their dams, it is possible that the dam became seronegative prior to the sampling event. An alternative biological explanation for either of these dam\u2010pup discrepancies would be allosuckling, which has been reported in bats (Roulin & Heeb 1999). However, owing to the low antibody concentrations involved and subsequent life events, these discrepancies in dam\u2010pup serostatus most likely arose from observational gaps.",

            "text": "Throughout the course of the study, there was strong evidence of seasonal horizontal transmission among young bats and adult females. Younger, seronegative bats typically seroconverted between 16 and 24 months of age, and these events were clustered in periods corresponding with late pregnancy of adult females (March 2011 and January 2012). These events were coupled in time with increases (both seroconverting and more moderate) in antibody concentrations of adult females. The undulating pattern of seroconversion in adult females with breeding is supported by a similar association of seropositivity with late pregnancy and lactation seen in field studies (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011). This is probably due to shifts in the immunological response during pregnancy. Typically, late pregnancy is coupled with a depression of cell\u2010mediated immunity (Boue, Nicolas & Montagnon 1971; Weinberg 1984), and this has been demonstrated for Myotis bats (Christe, Arlettaz & Vogel 2000; Baker, Schountz & Wang 2013). Thus, the finding that late pregnancy appears to make adult females susceptible to henipavirus infection might suggest an important role for cell\u2010mediated immunity in its control outside of these times. Regardless of mechanism, however, the coupling of adult female seroconversions with those of young bats appears to indicate an increase in horizontal transmission during these periods. This seasonal increase in transmission might represent a period of increased zoonotic risk, as infection peaks in juvenile bats have been associated with increased zoonotic spillover of Marburg virus (Amman et al. 2012).",

The reason for their apparent resistance to these periods of increased transmission is unknown, but it may be that the pregnancy\u2010related change in immune responses may be the key driving factor of infection in adult bats. Very few seroconversions of adult males occurred throughout the present study and those that did were not coupled in time with pregnancy/lactation. Although explanations regarding the timing of so few, events are somewhat speculative, rather than being associated with pregnancy/lactation as in the adult females and young, seroconversions of adult males occurred in the middle of the year (May 2010 and July 2011), closer to the April \u2013 June mating period of E. helvum (Mutere 1968), when increased aggression among males and more intimate contact with females is likely. Thus, rather than being associated with increased horizontal transmission during the time of pregnancy/lactation, the few adult male transmissions may have been associated with the mating period.",

            "text": "Here, evidence of active infection in the colony was seen throughout the study period (including in bats born in the facility), but was not first observed until 4 months into the study. The population\u2010level infection persistence in this small population is consistent with the finding that the small, isolated population of E. helvum annobonensis maintains henipavirus infection (Peel et al. 2012). The pressing questions then are that of site and mechanism for this population\u2010level persistence. Where, and in whom, is the virus maintained, and what drives periods of active infection and quiescence? Two potential mechanisms for this population\u2010level virus persistence are that immunity after a period of infection declines (i.e. SIRS dynamics) or the existence of persistently infected individuals. In the case of the former, the waning\u2010seroconversion cycle in adult females provides evidence that SIRS dynamics may exist in this system. Furthermore, other studies of henipaviruses in E. helvum show a decrease in adult seroprevalence with age in years (Peel 2012), which may also lend itself to such dynamics. In the latter case of persistently infected individuals, theoretical models have shown such individuals would greatly contribute to population\u2010level persistence of henipaviruses (Plowright et al. 2011). Recrudescent henipavirus infection has already been suggested to occur in humans and Pteropus bats (Rogers et al. 1996; Tan et al. 2002; Sohayati et al. 2011), and another paramyxovirus (Porcine rubulavirus) is known to persist in the male reproductive tract of pigs for over 4 months (Rivera\u2010Benitez et al. 2013). Also, but speculatively, if vertical infection did occur (although no evidence was found in this study), infected neonates might become immunotolerant to henipaviruses and continue lifelong excretion in a manner similar to Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (Potgieter 1995). In this case, individuals would be born matAb positive, and, following matAb waning, fail to seroconvert on exposure. Indeed, there were some individuals in this study which had failed to seroconvert by \u22654 years of age. To further address questions regarding potential mechanisms of persistence, however, longitudinal molecular virological studies are required (see below).",

In the current study, naturally occurring population seroprevalences might have been disrupted by the end of the study period, as evidenced by an increase in juvenile seroprevalence to levels comparable to adults. This increase is probably attributable to bats born in 2011 having higher levels of matAb (Table 2, Fig. S2), which were still detectable at 10 months of age. The reasons for the high matAb concentrations in these bats relative to their wild counterparts or pups born in 2010 are unknown, but it is possible that if infection equilibrium previously existed in the wild population, it may be disrupted by the absence of migration, severe reduction in population size and closure to outside infection, as necessitated by the study design. Continued observation of this population over time will help to address these questions.",

In addition to working towards addressing mechanisms of persistence, such data would enable confirmation that observed seroconversions truly are linked with active infection. Although efforts to detect henipavirus RNA in throat swabs taken during this study are ongoing, it was not practically possible to collect urine for molecular analysis. Encouragingly, however, longitudinal molecular studies of wild bat populations show shedding events occurring at life\u2010history stages that would be predicted by the seroconversions seen during the current study. For example, longitudinal sampling of wild Pteropus roosts in Thailand and Myotis populations in Germany shows seasonal excretion peaks of henipavirus and coronaviruses, respectively, that are associated with pregnancy and lactation (Gloza\u2010Rausch et al. 2008; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2009). Thus, our findings here are potentially generalizable to other systems and may indicate that seasons of late pregnancy/lactation in bat populations might represent periods of increased zoonotic risk.",
