The pandemic, as declared by the WHO, has led to >300,000 cases worldwide reported as of March 2020, in all continents, excluding Antarctica, spreading on a logarithmic scale in Europe. Italy is currently the second most affected country after China and, as of 13 March 2020, Europe was declared the centre of the pandemic 2 . Because of the very high transmission capacity, the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection a public health emergency of international concern.",

With >5,000 patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, our IBD center in Milan, Italy, has been flooded by requests from the patients themselves inquiring about the risk of infection in patients with IBD, and asking what precautions to take, particularly regarding, but not limited to, their immunosuppressive treatment. The COVID-19 outbreak is a fast and evolving situation, and information on the incidence and/or risk of infection in patients with IBD is not yet available. However, it is important to counsel patients to inform them that >80% of reported cases of COVID-19 have been mild in published studies, and the proportion of fatal cases might be an overestimate as many asymptomatic cases are not identified 3 .",

At the moment, there are no formal evidence-based recommendations from clinical societies or governments for patients on immunosuppression, such as those with IBD. However, a study in a tertiary care population of 2,600 patients with IBD followed for >15,000 patient-years described an exhaustive characterization and validation (hospitalization reports) of all serious viral infections (for example, all that required hospitalization) including varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) but not SARS-CoV-2 (ref. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide outbreak has led to a dramatic challenge for all healthcare systems, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) centres. Here, we describe the fast changes and clinical issues that IBD specialists could face during this SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic, highlighting the potential rearrangements of care and resetting of clinical priorities. to anti-TNF agents, >4,800 patient-years of exposure to immunosuppressants, and >1,200 patient-years of follow-up in those >65 years. The researchers identified 31 cases of serious viral infections related to EBV, CMV, VZV and HSV infection. The two independent drivers of the risk were clinically active IBD and exposure to thiopurines. No cases of severe seasonal flu and no deaths by seasonal flu were observed. Although many of our patients have been vaccinated against seasonal flu, as recommended by European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines, vaccination strategy adoption is very low and the protective effect of the vaccine is moderate, particularly in patients with an immunosuppression status. Thus, at the moment, it does not seem appropriate to recommend the pause of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with IBD, as stated by International Organization of IBD 8 ( fig. 1 ), Crohn's & Colitis UK and Crohn's & Colitis Foundation in their guidance for patients. Moreover, although thiopurines have been associated with risk of serious viral infection in IBD 7 , the IOIBD recommends they continue to be taken as these agents take months to leave the body and so stopping these medications will not help in the short term. In addition, a survey from the European Federation of Crohn's and Colitis association and ECCO is ongoing to explore the need for education about COVID-19.",

Indeed, for influenza it has long been recommended that affected patients should wear masks to limit droplet spread and, therefore, the very same action could be used for immunosuppressed patients to reduce the risk of spread of infection. We have chosen to use surgical masks for both the clinical staff and the patients, but a global shortage of disposable surgical masks is creating challenges and this issue continues.",
