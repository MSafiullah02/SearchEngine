Although they share some clinical features and although they may coexist in the same individual, they are distinct disease syndromes with different pathogenetic mechanisms. In each case much of the morbidity and mortality is associated with exacerbations of disease, in response to a variety of trigger factors. A common feature of asthma and COPD is the important role of infection in triggering exacerbations. Infections have also been implicated in the etiology of the two diseases. This chapter will review the epidemiological evidence implicating infectious pathogens as triggers and will discuss the mechanisms of interaction between the host\u2013pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology that result in an exacerbation.",

Seasonal patterns of identification of respiratory viruses are associated with peaks in hospital admissions for both children and adults with asthma indicating a role for such infections in severe asthma attacks [5]. Direct evidence implicating viral infection in asthma exacerbations has been provided by studies showing an increased rate of virus detection in individuals suffering asthma attacks. Viruses have been detected in 80\u201385% of asthma exacerbations in children 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10. and in 75\u201380% in adults 11., 12., 13., 14.. The highest rates of identification are in those studies where subjects were followed prospectively allowing collection of clinical specimens early in the course of the illness, where PCR-based methods of diagnosis were used instead of or in addition to serology and culture, and where the methodology used allowed for detection of rhinoviruses. The rate of detection of viruses between exacerbations when individuals are asymptomatic is only of the order of 3\u201312%. In contrast a study of transtracheal aspirates in adult asthmatics during exacerbations [15] yielded sparse bacterial cultures with no correlation to clinical illness and no difference from those of normal subjects.",

Most such studies have therefore focused on the experimental innoculation of rhinovirus in allergic rhinitic or mild asthmatic individuals and normal control subjects 17., 18., 19., 20., 21., 22., 23., 24., 25., 26., 27., 28..

One attempt to provide a model combining allergen exposure and virus infection utilized RV infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Individuals received three high dose allergen challenges in the week prior to innoculation to try to mimic combined allergen exposure and virus infection [32]. Interestingly, prior allergen challenge in this model, somewhat unexpectedly, appeared to protect against an RV cold with delayed nasal leukocytosis, increased generation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and a delayed, less severe clinical course. There was an inverse correlation between nasal lavage eosinophilia and the severity of cold symptoms. The explanation proposed by the authors of this study is that limited high dose allergen challenge may not reproduce the effects of chronic low dose allergen exposure and may stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 or antiviral cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1. In work by de Kluijver et al. the effects of a 10-day period of low dose allergen exposure in house-dust mite sensitive and/or experimental RV16 infection were studied. No synergistic or additive effects were observed as regards lung function parameters [33]. Further development of models of experimental combined allergen exposure and virus infection is clearly required.",

We investigated physiologic, virologic, and immunopathologic responses to experimental rhinovirus infection in blood, induced sputum, and bronchial lavage in 10 atopic mild asthmatic and 15 nonatopic normal volunteers. Rhinovirus infection induced significantly greater lower respiratory symptoms, lung function impairment, increases in bronchial hyperreactivity, and eosinophilic lower airway inflammation in asthmatic compared to normal subjects. We also saw trends to increased neutrophils and lymphocytes in the lower airway in asthmatics, and coincident reductions in blood lymphocytes, suggesting trafficking to the airway. In asthmatic, but not normal subjects, virus load was significantly related to lower respiratory symptoms, bronchial hyperreactivity, and reductions in blood total and CD8+ lymphocytes and lung function impairment was significantly related to neutrophilic and eosinophilic lower airway inflammation. This study demonstrated increased rhinovirus-induced clinical illness severity in asthmatic compared to normal subjects, provided evidence of strong relationships between virus load, lower airway virus-induced inflammation, and asthma exacerbation severity and suggests that this approach could provide a very good model in which to examine asthma exacerbation pathogenesis as well as treatment interventions.",

Although the possibility of nasopharyngeal contamination cannot be ruled out, RV has been detected in lower airway clinical specimens such as sputum [35], tracheal brushings [26], and BAL [36] by both RT-PCR and culture. RV has been cultured in cell lines of bronchial epithelial cell origin [37] and replication has been demonstrated in primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells 38., 39., 40.. The preference of RV for culture at 33\u00b0C rather than 37\u00b0C has been used as an argument against lower airway infection but there is now evidence that replication does occur at lower airway temperatures [41]. Finally the use of in situ hybridization has conclusively demonstrated RV replication in bronchial biopsies of subjects following experimental infection [38] and recent immunochemistry data suggests a preference for basal cells [42]. These data confirm that RV infection of the lower airway does occur and directly implicate lower airway infection in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.",

However, a mouse model of rhinovirus infection has recently been successfully developed for the first time. New methods of purification and concentration of rhinoviruses, were used to show that for the minor group of rhinoviruses (the \u223c10% that use the LDL receptor as their mode of entry into cells), wild-type BALB/c mice can be successfully infected and that most of the disease-related outcomes observed in humans were reproduced in this unique new model. These outcomes include induction of both innate and acquired immune responses, induction of mucin synthesis and secretion, induction of both acute neutrophilic and prolonged lymphocytic airway inflammation, and induction of chemokines responsible for chemo-attraction of neutrophils, lymphocytes and dendritic cells as well as a range of proinflammatory cytokines. Mice transgenic for a chimera of ICAM-1, the receptor for the major group (\u223c90%) of rhinoviruses, in which the rhinovirus-binding domains were human, but the remainder of the molecule mouse were then developed. This transgenic mouse was then able to be infected by major group strains, thus generating mouse models capable of being infected by all rhinovirus serotypes. Finally an established mouse model of allergic airway inflammation was used to demonstrate that rhinovirus infection of this model resulted in rhinovirus-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. The asthma-related outcomes exacerbated by infection in this model include exacerbation of airway hyperresponsiveness, exacerbation of mucin synthesis and secretion (MUC5AC and MUC5B), exacerbation of neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and lymphocytic airway inflammation, and augmented induction of both Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-4 and -13) cytokines. The development of this novel mouse model of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations, should allow mechanisms of disease to be investigated in vivo and true causation be established in vivo. [43].",

Recent data suggests that the RV 3C protease cleaves the complement factors C3 and C5 which may interfere with the destruction of virus-infected cells [50]. For other viruses, for example influenza, the complement system forms an important link between the innate and specific immune systems. Mice deficient for the third component of complement are highly susceptible to primary influenza, showing reduced priming of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells in lung draining lymph nodes and severely impaired recruitment into the lung of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector T-cells producing IFN-\u03b3 [51].

The detailed immunological mechanisms underlying this interaction are currently being investigated, but recent data suggest deficient production of type I (\u03b2), type II (\u03b3), and type III (\u03bb) IFNs, as well as Th1 cytokines (IL-12) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), are likely to increase virus-induced lower airway inflammation 34., 61., 62.. These deficiencies are also accompanied by augmented production of Th2 cytokines suggesting that perhaps allergen-induced inflammation is also increased in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

There is relatively limited expression of ICAM-1 in airway epithelium prior to RV infection [70] and this may explain the patchy nature of infection. The upregulation of ICAM-1 in the asthmatic airway is one possible explanation for the increased severity of RV infection in asthma. RV upregulates expression of its own receptor ICAM-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Following experimental infection with RV, ICAM-1 expression is upregulated in nasal epithelium within 24 h, declining by day 5 [71]. RV has similar effects on EC from the lower airway. RV has been shown to upregulate ICAM-1 in primary bronchial EC in vitro\n[72] and ICAM-1 is upregulated in bronchial biopsies following experimental infection of asthmatic subjects with RV16 [73].",

In both A549 cells and in PBEC pretreatment with three corticosteroids, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and mometasone furoate inhibits RV16-induced increases in ICAM-1 surface expression, mRNA, and promoter activation without alteration of virus infectivity or replication. Dexamethasone suppresses ICAM-1 in PHTEC and inhibits RV infections [84]. Dexamethasone does not inhibit infection of PHTEC by minor group RV2 [85]. Disappointingly, a study of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatics prior to experimental RV infection failed to show reduced virus-induced ICAM-1 expression in bronchial biopsies [73] but it is possible that a longer course and/or a higher dose of inhaled steroid or administration of oral steroids might have demonstrated a significant effect.",

To determine whether IFN-\u03bb production was important in determining responses to RV infection in vivo, the same volunteers were then experimentally infected with RV16, the severity of symptoms and reductions in lung function were monitored and the virus load was determined in BAL. In vitro production of IFN-\u03bbs by RV infection of BAL cells was strongly inversely correlated with both common cold symptoms and in vivo virus load and strongly positively correlated with severity of falls in lung function, in asthmatic and normal volunteers experimentally infected with RV16. Asthmatic patients, in whom in vitro IFN-\u03bb production in BAL cells was significantly lower than in normal subjects, exhibited increased common cold symptoms and reductions in lung function and virus load after in vivo RV16 infection. In marked contrast normal subjects had robust IFN-\u03bb responses, less severe cold symptoms, lower virus load, and no significant changes in lung function. These results document the importance of IFN-\u03bb in the host defense against RV infection in vitro and in vivo and indicate that deficient IFN-\u03bb production is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

Such cytokines and chemokines activate and recruit a variety of other cells including lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 share proinflammatory properties such as the induction of the acute phase response and the activation of both T- and B-lymphocytes. IL-1 enhances the adhesion of inflammatory cells to endothelium, facilitating chemotaxis [105]. TNF-\u03b1 is a potent antiviral cytokine but in vitro increases the susceptibility of cultured epithelial cells to infection by RV14 through upregulation of ICAM-1 [37]. IL-6 has been shown to stimulate IgA-mediated immune responses. IL-11 may also be important in virus-induced asthma [106]. It appears to cause bronchoconstriction by a direct effect on bronchial smooth muscle [102]. Production of this cytokine by human stromal cells in vitro is increased by RV14, RSV, and parainfluenza type 3 but not by cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 or adenovirus. In vivo IL-11 is elevated in nasal aspirates from children with colds, levels correlating with the presence of wheezing.",

NO inhibits RV-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF and viral replication in a human respiratory epithelial cell line 132., 133.. RSV also induces NOS2 and increases nitrite levels in supernatant from A549 cells, from HPBEC culture and in BAL fluid from RSV-infected BALB/c mice, effects opposed by IL-4 and dexamethasone but unaffected by IL-13 or IFN-\u03b3 [134]. Replication of RSV in Hep2 cells is inhibited following transfection with a retroviral construct containing NOS and this inhibition is abolished by the NOS inhibitor, NG-methyl-l-arginine [135]. Replication of influenza A and B in Mabin Darby kidney cells is severely impaired by the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine [136].",

Increased levels of exhaled NO are found in nonasthmatic volunteers following natural colds [138] as well as in asthmatic patients after experimental RV infection [131]. In the latter study, an inverse association between NO increase and worsening of airway hyperresponsiveness was demonstrated arguing in favor of a protective role for this substance. This is further supported by the observation that NO reduces cytokine production and viral replication in an in vitro model of RV infection [133]. Interestingly, studies of viral upper respiratory tract infections have failed to demonstrate an increase in nasal NO after experimental RSV, RV, and influenza infections [139]. In normal subjects experimental influenza infection increased oral NO 8 days postinfection but had no effect on nasal NO [140]. This raises the possibility that during respiratory virus infection induction of NO is selective for the lower respiratory tract.",

The need for replicative virus is demonstrated by the inhibition of RV induction of EC cytokines after UV inactivation. One product of replication, common to ssRNA viruses such as RV and also RSV and influenza, is dsRNA, which has been shown to activate components of signaling pathways including dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, IKK\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase with resultant induction of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES 110., 142..

IFN-\u03b3 has a complex role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It appears to increase basophil and mast cell histamine release [161] but on the other hand inhibits the expression of type 2 cytokines. Production of IFN-\u03b3 is increased in PBMC [162] and in nasal secretions [104] during RV colds and in human and animal models of influenza, parainfluenza, and RSV infection 119., 163., 164.. There are exceptions where the antiviral response exhibits a Th2 character or a mixture of Th1/Th2. In animal models of RSV, different proteins of the virus may induce either Th1 or Th2 type responses and priming with such proteins prior to infection with whole virus can influence the character, effectiveness, and associated immunopathology of the immune response [165].",

            "text": "Eosinophils are increased in bronchial epithelium in biopsies taken from normal and asthmatic volunteers following experimental RV infection; in a small study eosinophilic inflammation persisted for up to 6 weeks in asthmatic subjects [21] and in our recent study eosinophil numbers in the BAL were significantly (threefold) increased in asthmatic compared to normal subjects during the acute RV infection and correlated significantly with reductions in lung function only in the asthmatic subjects [34]. In allergic rhinitis experimental RV infection increases BAL eosinophils following segmental allergen challenge, again persisting for 6 weeks [28], and increased levels of ECP are found in the sputum of RV-infected subjects [23] and during naturally occurring acute exacerbations of asthma [13]. Eosinophils accumulate in the airway under the influence of IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-8, RANTES, and eotaxin [176]. Of these only IL-5 has not been shown to be produced by airway EC in vitro after infection by RV. Expression of RANTES is increased in nasal secretions of children with natural virus-induced asthma [107]. RANTES is upregulated in primary nasal EC cultures by RSV [177] and RV [178]. GM-CSF is important in bone marrow eosinophil production and in eosinophil survival [176] but levels are not increased during viral upper respiratory tract infections 107., 179., 180.. Levels of eotaxin in nasal lavage rise after experimental RV16 infection [181]. These data suggest a pathogenic role for eosinophils in virus-induced asthma. However, a protective role is also possible. In allergic rhinitic subjects, infected with RV after high dose allergen challenge, the severity and duration of cold symptoms were inversely related to the NL eosinophil count prior to infection [32]. Eosinophils may contribute to viral antigen presentation. Eosinophils pretreated with GM-CSF bind RV16 via ICAM-1 and present viral antigen to RV16-specific T-cells, inducing proliferation and secretion of IFN-\u03b3 [182]. Eosinophils have antiviral actions in parainfluenza-infected guinea pigs [183]. EDN and ECP have ribonuclease activity and reduce RSV infectivity [184]. The role of the eosinophil in the antiviral immune response thus requires further evaluation.",

Levels correlated well with the symptoms of the disease with concentrations in infants presenting with bronchiolitis being fivefold higher than in those with only upper respiratory tract symptomatology. Cultured alveolar macrophages can be infected with parainfluenza virus and respond with an increase in arachidonic acid metabolism. Several of the products of this pathway are known inducers of airway constriction, including LTC4, LTD4, PGF2\u03b1, and thromboxanes and/or stimulants of mucous secretion such as PGF2\u03b1, LTB4, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [187].

Similar results were obtained in IS taken 2 and 9 days after experimental RV16 infection in asthmatics. Intracellular staining demonstrated an increase in cells positive for IL-8 at day 2 attributable to increased IL-8 positive neutrophils [25]. The chemokine IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils but also acts on lymphocytes, basophils, and primed eosinophils. Increased IL-8 has been found in NL from children with natural colds [104]. Experimental RV16 infection of asthmatics resulted in elevated NL IL-8, correlating with cold/asthma symptom scores and histamine PC20 [25]. IS from asthmatics with exacerbations has both elevated IL-8 and neutrophilia 23., 190.. A study of experimental infection in asthmatic children also demonstrated elevated IL-8 and neutrophilia in NL during the acute infection and levels of neutrophil myeloperoxidase correlated with symptom severity [191].

The ability to directly kill virus-infected cells is regulated by a balance between inhibitory and activating receptors [193]. Killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs), Ig-like receptors that recognize HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules, and the lectin-like CD94/NKG2A receptor that interacts with HLA-E allow NK cells to recognize cells expressing normal self MHC class I [194].

Cytokines and chemokines shown to enhance the activities of NK cells in vitro and in vivo include IFN-\u03b1/-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, MIP-1\u03b1 MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, 2, 3, and RANTES.

Human NK cells cultured in medium supplemented with IL-4 differentiated into NK type 2 cells, secreting IL-5 and IL-13 and when cultured in the presence of IL-12, differentiated into NK type 1 cells secreting IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3.

NK cell production of IL-5 is enhanced by IL-4 and reduced by IL-10 and IL-12 [197]. In a mouse model of asthma, intracellular staining of NK cells has demonstrated IL-5 production and depletion of NK cells resulted in reduced airway eosinophilia [198].",

In a study of 186 patients rhinoviruses, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus were significantly associated with COPD exacerbations [208]. Between 60% and 70% of exacerbations are associated with preceding symptoms of a common cold. The frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization is higher in the winter. One explanation for this could be the increased frequency of respiratory viruses at this time of the year. A recent study of 321 exacerbations in 83 patients with moderate to severe COPD using new diagnostic methods including RT-PCR shows a high incidence of viral infection [209]. Viruses were detected in nasal aspirates at exacerbation in almost 40% of cases. Rhinovirus was the most common, occurring in 58% of cases where a virus was present. The presence of virus was associated with increased dyspnea, cold symptoms, and sore throat and with prolonged recovery from exacerbation. Earlier studies relying on serology and virus culture quote lower virus detection rates of 15\u201320% 208., 210., 211., 212.. Other studies of more severe exacerbations using more comprehensive PCR methods confirmed the importance of virus infection, with viruses being detected in around 50% of exacerbations 152., 213.. Because these studies all involve sampling relatively late in the course of illness, it is likely that these detection rates underestimate the true importance of virus infections.",

Various bacterial species are present in the airways of 25\u201340% of patients, even when the COPD is stable but increased frequency of recovery of bacteria during exacerbations (\u223c55%) as well as higher bacterial loads during exacerbations both suggest that they play an important role in a significant number 152., 214., 215.. Significant bacterial infection has been suggested when there is an abundance of neutrophils in the sputum [216] and when the sputum is purulent and green (due to neutrophil myeloperoxidase) [217]. Bacteria may contribute to the pathogenesis of an exacerbation due to increased bacterial loads of bacteria already colonizing diseased airways, however in addition to this, acquisition of new bacterial strains has also been shown to be important, increasing the risk of exacerbation over twofold [218].",

Both proteinase enzymes and reactive oxygen species cause damage to the epithelium, stimulating mucus production and impairing mucociliary clearance.

During exacerbations 50% had bacteria present and when present, bacterial numbers were greater. When protected brush specimens were taken during severe acute exacerbations of COPD requiring ventilation [227] bacteria were detected in 50% but it was not possible to distinguish patients more likely to have bacteria on the basis of clinical features or other investigations.",

There are 102 serotyped strains of rhinovirus and several more that have not been serotyped and no effective vaccine has been introduced. A decavalent vaccine [246] developed in the 1970s was ultimately of limited efficacy. The influenza viruses display antigenic shift and drift. Vaccines must be modified every 2\u20133 years to cover the strains prevalent at the time. Vaccination against RSV experienced a major setback in the 1960s when the use of formalin-inactivated virus in young babies resulted in increased disease severity following subsequent virus infection [247]. Eighty percent of vaccinated children required hospitalization when subsequently infected with RSV, as compared to 5% of controls. The lungs of two vaccinated children who died contained eosinophilic infiltrates. It has been suggested that formalin inactivation may have modified epitopes within the RSV G and F surface glycoproteins, resulting in a modified immune response to subsequent infection with enhanced immunopathology [248]. Vaccinated individuals demonstrate a number of differences from individuals who have suffered natural RSV infection including a lack of specific mucosal antibodies and deficient neutralizing and fusion-inhibiting serum antibodies [249]. There are also differences in the cell-mediated immune response with some vaccinated individuals demonstrating peripheral eosinophilia and exaggerated lymphocytic proliferative responses to RSV [250]. To protect against RSV infection a successful vaccine would need to provide more effective protection than natural infection, which is itself frequently followed by reinfection [251], and would have to be administered early in infancy to have an effect on infant bronchiolitis.",

Vitamin C and zinc gluconate [252] both may shorten the duration of a cold by 1\u20132 days. The inhalation of humidified hot air provides symptomatic relief [253]. Nasal IFN-\u03b1 is an effective treatment for the common cold [254] but must be given either prior to or shortly after exposure to the virus. It is also expensive and is associated with significant local side effects such as bleeding and discharge. These problems have limited its clinical use. However IFN therapy for virus-induced asthma exacerbations may be more useful in view of the deficiencies identified by recent studies. Further because of the large number of viruses producing similar clinical syndromes, the general antiviral properties of IFNs would provide significant advantage over the use of specific antiviral drugs.",

The use of amantidine has been limited by CNS side effects such as dizziness and insomnia; fewer such side effects are seen with rimantidine. Both drugs are indicated during epidemics for treatment and prophylaxis in high risk groups including asthmatics. Neither is active against influenza B. Two neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, are active against both influenza A and B 255., 256., 257.. These agents are effective in preventing infection when used as prophylaxis during the influenza season and, as treatment, they reduce the duration of illness if started within 36\u201348 h of the onset of illness. Zanamivir must be given by inhalation whereas oseltamivir can be given orally. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog active against RSV in vivo and also against influenza in vitro. Nebulized ribavirin therapy is licensed for use in hospitalized infants and children in the first 3 days of RSV bronchiolitis. It is however expensive and of unproven benefit on clinical outcome. Because of its toxicity it is not appropriate for asthma. RSV enriched immunoglobulin was effective as prophylaxis for infants at high risk of RSV bronchiolitis [258] but has been superseded by RSV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [259].",
