When introducing or amending regulations and procedures for the release and clearance of goods carried by air, Contracting States are required to l consult with aircraft operators and other parties concerned, with the aim of accomplishing the actions set forth in the Annex. Furthermore, Contracting States are required to develop procedures for the pre-arrival and pre-departure lodgement of an import and export goods declaration to enable expeditious release/clearance of the goods. Where the nature of a consignment could attract the attention of different public authorities, e.g. the customs, veterinary or sanitary controllers, Contracting States shall endeavour to delegate authority for release/clearance to customs or one of the other agencies or, where that is not feasible, take all necessary steps to ensure that release/clearance is coordinated and, if possible, carried out simultaneously and with a minimum of delay. Contracting States are not normally expected to require the physical examination of cargo to be imported or exported and are required to use risk management to determine which goods shall be examined and the extent of that examination. Where practicable, and with a view to improving efficiency, modern screening or examination techniques are required to be used to facilitate the physical examination of goods to be imported or exported.",

With regard to information required by the public authorities, Contracting States should provide for the electronic submission of cargo information prior to the arrival or departure of cargo. Contracting States shall limit their data requirements to only those particulars which are deemed necessary by the public authorities to release or clear imported goods or goods intended for exportation. And are further required to provide for the collection of statistical data at such times and under such arrangements so that the release of imported goods or those intended for exportation is not delayed thereby. Subject to the technological capabilities of the Contracting State, documents for the importation or exportation of goods, including the Cargo Manifest and/or air waybills, will be accepted when presented in electronic form transmitted to an information system of the public authorities.",

Annex 9 defines the terms \"release\" and \"clearance\", where \"clearance\" is given only when all official requirements have been met, while \"release\" means that customs put the goods at the disposal of the person concerned whether or not all the customs formalities have been completed and whether or not the goods can actually be cleared at that time.",

The Manual recommends that when releasing goods in such circumstances, customs needs to be satisfied that there is no risk of non-compliance with the law, all official requirements will be met, and formalities will be completed in due course. In addition, where import duties and taxes have not been paid, customs must be assured that security for their payment has been provided.

It also includes the acceptance of a certain level of risk in consignments in the interests of focusing resources on those goods and circumstances where risk is considered to be highest and enforcement action most likely to be needed. Customs and other authorities, whose size and resources are static or actually decreasing, have to deal with the considerable growth in international trade volumes while at the same time provide simplified documentation and procedures, as well as immediate release/clearance of goods to meet business demands for on-schedule delivery. This means that they can no longer use traditional methods of controlling goods on an individual consignment basis to ensure that the correct revenue is collected, trade policy agreements (quotas, preferences) are enforced and that prohibited or restricted goods are detected and dealt with appropriately.

The need to enhance controls in the face of increased risks posed by drug trafficking, violations of intellectual property rights, smuggling of endangered species and other illegal activities, combined with the growth in international trade volumes, has made it increasingly difficult for government inspection agencies to perform their enforcement duties with manual procedures alone. Moreover, studies of traditional air cargo systems without the assistance of information technology have concluded that the average \"dwell-time\" of an imported shipment (from its arrival to its release for delivery) is 4.5 days-a delay which to most air cargo customers is unacceptable.

Where the cause of decease was a contagious disease, the corpse itself was required to be wrapped in a shroud soaked in an antiseptic solution. A further requirement was that the metal coffin must thereupon be hermetically closed (soldered) and fitted into a wooden coffin in such a manner as to preclude movement. The wooden coffin was required to be of a thickness of not less than 3 cm. and its joints must be completely watertight.

Also it was claimed that these two agreements imposed strict rules on the cross-border transfer of mortal remains, applied essentially to 'nonnationals' and hence ran counter to the Community scheme of things. Accordingly, and with a view to addressing the case where a Community citizen expired in a Community country other than his own and his remains had to be repatriated to his country, a Committee was appointed by the European Parliament to consider an instrument that addressed the conveyance of mortal remains suggested in 2003 Resolution 2003 /2032 . This Resolution noted that, on account of the above agreements, the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person's country of origin, Another compelling reason for this Resolution was the recognition that, in view of the growth in intra-Community tourism, the increasing numbers of retired people who choose to live in a country other than their own and, more generally, greater intra-Community mobility which is actually encouraged, the number of Community citizens who die in a country other than their country of origin was bound to increase. This was considered against the backdrop that Community citizens should, mutatis mutandis, be able to move between and reside in Member States in similar conditions to nationals of a Member State moving around or changing their place of residence in their own country, and that exercising the right to freedom of movement and freedom of residence should be facilitated to the utmost by reducing administrative formalities to an absolute minimum.",

IATA further suggested that acceptance of such coffins is dependent upon the type of aircraft, requirements of entry and clearance and prior approval of the countries of origin, transit and destination. 15 The Council noted that comments on the carriage of coffins had been received from twenty seven States (from a total of 72 member States at that time) and two overseas territories. Three of these States reported that they were bound by the provisions of the 1937 Berlin Agreement and Eight States advised ICAO that the carriage of corpses existed in their national legislations.

Prompted by rapid decomposition in flight, such transports occasionally arrive in appalling conditions; in some States (Australia, Philippines, Venezuela, Netherlands Antilles), therefore, it is required that corpses be embalmed prior to air transport, thus eliminating at least certain difficulties.

The ICAO guidance goes on to say that legislation often requires a post mortem examination of those killed in an accident and in some instances, there may be remains that cannot be identified. 19 ICAO also calls for personal effects of the deceased to be correctly handled and returned to their lawful owners. 20 The Guidance also calls for the State of occurrence to provide for the return of human remains 21 while also devolving that burden-of the carriage of such remains-upon the aircraft operator involved in the accident. 22",

            "text": "There are two Annexes to the Chicago Convention which bear some relevance to the carriage of human remains by air-Annex 9 (Facilitation) and Annex 18 (The Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air). The Annex 9 definition of cargo implies that 17 C-WP/2448, 5/6/57, supra note 15, Appendix \"A\" at 25. 18 human remains could be categorized as cargo by giving the definition of cargo as \"any property carried on an aircraft other than mail, stores and accompanied or mishandled baggage\". This definition is slightly different from the one contained in another ICAO document-Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air 23 which defines \"cargo\" as \"any property carried on an aircraft other than mail and accompanied or mishandled baggage\". Annex 18 does not define the word \"cargo\" but defines \"dangerous goods\" as articles or substances which are capable of posing a risk to health, safety, property or the environment and which are shown in the list of dangerous goods in the Technical Instructions or which are classified according to those instructions. The Technical Instructions do not list human remains as being dangerous cargo. However, it behooves the international aviation community to inquire, along the lines of ICAO discussions in the Council, whether human remains could be ruled out as not posing a risk to health or the environment under any circumstances of carriage by air or whether human remains, depending on the way it is packed for transport, could be considered as dangerous goods. 24 Getting back to Annex 9, there is a whole chapter in the Annex-Chapter 4dedicated to the entry and departure of cargo and other articles. Surprisingly, there is no provision in the Annex for priority of clearance or transport of human remains over other cargo, despite the prominence given to the subject in ICAO Circular 285 - AN/166. 25 Another surprise is that, although there is a Recommended Practice in the Annex which suggests that electronic information systems for the release and clearance of \"goods\" (my emphasis) should cover their transfer between air and other modes of transport, 26 there is no definition of \"goods\" in the Annex. Do corpses or cremated human remains come under the purview of \"goods\"? This question is valid in the context of Appendix 3 to the Annex which has a template for a cargo manifest where there exists a column for \"Nature of Goods\". There is no mention of the word \"cargo\" in this template.",

The IGOM requires the carrier to make sure that a Human Remains Acceptance Checklist has been used (if required by the operating airline). Carriers are required, according to the IGOM, not to accept any human remains that are consolidated with any cargo other than other human remains. With regard to cremated human remains the Manual requires that only urns or other suitable containers as cargo with no special restrictions are accepted for carriage and that the carrier should make sure that the urn or other container is packed in a neutral outer pack that will protect the urn from breakage and/spillage. 28 It also prescribes that human remains in coffins should not be stored next to food or live animals, adding that there appears to be no scientific or technical reason why live animals and human remains should be segregated in aircraft cargo compartments, except that it may be ethical for cultural reasons to segregate them.",

Boeing states that \"the safe transportation of live animals as air cargo is based on controlling three environmental factors: temperature, relative humidity level, and cargo compartment carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration. Each type of animal has unique environmental requirements for optimal health. Failure to properly control these environmental factors may have an impact on animal welfare, comfort, and survivability, affecting animal cargo revenue\". 33 In Gluckman v. American Airlines Inc., 34 The plaintiff sued the defendant American Airlines for emotional distress damages, inter alia, suffered as a result of his dog dying of a heatstroke while being transported in the cargo hold of defendant's aircraft where the heat had reached 140 \u00b0F-a temperature that was in violation of applicable guidelines. in violation of the airline's cargo hold guidelines. The court held that a value could not be placed on emotional damage caused by loss of companionship and that the plaintiff's only recourse could be the recovery of the value of the pet. The basis of the court's decision was that under the applicable jurisdiction's laws (New York), a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress \"arises only in unique circumstances, when a defendant owes a special duty only to plaintiff, or where there is proof of a traumatic event that caused the plaintiff to fear for her own safety.\" 35 In the 1987 case of Deiro v. American Airlines 36 where the Plaintiff-appellant appealed from a district court order granting partial summary judgment for defendant-appellee American Airlines, Inc. The district court held that the Airlines' liability for the death of seven greyhound racing dogs and injuries to two others, caused by heat exposure while the dogs were being transported in the cargo area of a jet on which plaintiff was a passenger, was limited to a total of $750 pursuant to a liability limitation provision in Deiro's passenger ticket. Diero claimed that the dogs were not baggage. the court denied Deiro's cross-motion for partial summary judgment, rejecting his argument that animals are not \"baggage\" and therefore not subject to American's baggage liability limitation. That ruling was not appealed. Second, the court held as a matter of law that, under Oregon law, Deiro was not entitled to punitive damages. Although this second ruling was appealed, we do not reach it because our decision upholding the $750 liability limitation makes the punitive damages issue moot. The court of first instance ruled that Deiro's cross-motion for partial summary judgment was denied, rejecting his argument that animals are not \"baggage\" and therefore not subject to American's baggage liability limitation. That ruling was not appealed. Second, the court held as a matter of law that, under enue grew 12.9% YOY \u00a7 Shipments from Asia Pacific decreased 7.8% / revenue fell 13.5% YOY \u00a7 Revenue from all other regions was plus or minus 1-3%. 33 Safe Transport of Live Animal Cargo, Aero: Qtr. 02:12. http://www.boeing.com/commercial/ aeromagazine/articles/2012_q2/4/. 34 844 F.Supp. (151 S.D.N.Y., 1994) . 35 See also, Cucchi v.
