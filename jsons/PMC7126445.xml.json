Either type can establish lesions at any site of the human body with indistinguishable diseases (Patel et al., 2007). HSV is transmitted through direct contact of the infected secretions and presents the common biological features of herpesviruses, including latency and reactivation (Chakrabarty et al., 2004, Kleymann, 2005, Greco et al., 2007, Ramachandran and Kinchington, 2007). Clinical manifestations of HSV infection vary from asymptomatic infection to mucocutaneous lesions, life-threatening encephalitis, and fatal dissemination, depending on the portal of viral entry, host immune competence, and primary or secondary nature of the disease (Leflore et al., 2000, Nadelman and Newcomer, 2000, Brady and Bernstein, 2004)",

Significant efforts have been made to develop vaccines and agents against HSV infections. However, no effective vaccine is currently available (Rajcani and Durmanova, 2006, Us, 2006, Ramachandran and Kinchington, 2007). Acyclovir (ACV) remained the reference treatment for more than thirty years after its discovery (Greco et al., 2007). Drug-resistant strains emerged due to the extensive clinical use of ACV and its analogues, such as valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. Although there are some novel treatments available, the uncertainty of their efficacies and the high costs limited their clinical use (Brady and Bernstein, 2004, Chakrabarty et al., 2004, Kleymann, 2005, Greco et al., 2007, Kovalchuk et al., 2007). Therefore, it remains a continuous need to discover antiviral agents against HSV with lower resistant rate, toxicity and cost.",

            "text": "Rhubarb is a group of plants that belong to the genus Rheum in the family Polygonaceae and is one of the oldest and best-known traditional Chinese medicines. Chinese Rhubarb includes Rheum tanguticum (R. tanguticum), Rheum palmatum, Rheum officinale, etc. The pharmaceutically relevant compounds in rhubarb are sennosides, anthraquinones, stilbenes, glucose gallates, naphthalenes, and catechins (Ye et al., 2007). Hsiang et al. (2001) observed that the extract of rhubarb prevented the process of HSV attachment and penetration. Wang et al. (2003) reported that the extract of rhubarb showed antiviral activity against HSV that was comparable to acyclovir in vivo. A number of anthraquinones and anthrones isolated from plants and lichens have been shown to exhibit virucidal activity and non-virucidal antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including HSV (Meruelo et al., 1988, Schinazi et al., 1990, Tang et al., 1990, Andersen et al., 1991, Sydiskis et al., 1991, Barnard et al., 1992, Cohen et al., 1996, Hsiang et al., 2001, Semple et al., 2001). The anthraquinones in rhubarb are thus potentially the effective component against HSV. The anthraquinone derivatives in rhubarb include physcion, emodin, rhein, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol and their glucosides (Ye et al., 2007). Among these, emodin is the most abundant one (Huang et al., 2007). We initiated this study to test if emodin is the active ingredients from R. tanguticum against HSV infection and to investigate its antiviral activity HSV infection in tissue culture cells and in a mouse model.",

Fifty grams of the dried powdered roots of R. tanguticum was extracted by 8-fold of 85% ethanol under reflux three times (1.5 h each time). Concrete was obtained from the ethanol solution and dissolved in 500 mL H2O overnight. The solution was mixed with 500 mL 80% ethanol: acetone (1:1, v/v, pH = 4.0) and followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. The final product was obtained after filtering and drying. The main component is emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone). The quantity of emodin was observed and determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of emodin monomer is 84% and has a little impurities (Hou et al., 2003). Acyclovir (ACV, 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine) was synthesized by Keyi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Hubei, China.",

It was observed to be more potent in inhibiting HSV-2 than HSV-1. Other studies have also demonstrated antiviral activities of emodin against some enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis B virus, human cytomegalovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus; and non-enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus (Barnard et al., 1992, Cohen et al., 1996, Semple et al., 2001, Shuangsuo et al., 2006, Ho et al., 2007, Hsiang and Ho, 2008). Considering these findings, emodin may potentially play a significant role in anti-HSV management with broad spectrum of antiviral activities.",
