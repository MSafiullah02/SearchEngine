In particular, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential enzyme of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS), is the functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as well as for the recently identified SARS-CoV-24,5. It has been shown that ACE2 plays a protective role in chronic pathologies, like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, that are the comorbidities representing the risk of worse prognosis in COVID-19. The protective role of ACE2 has been evidenced by studies in mice models, showing more severe lung failure upon ACE2 down-regulation6.",
