SARS is caused by coronavirus (Peiris et al. 2003) and can result in significant morbidity and mortality (Lee et al. 2003). It is characterized by having radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, fever > 38\u00b0C or history of it in the past 2 days, history of chills in the past 2 days. A cough (new or increased), breathing difficulties, general malaise or myalgia, and a known history of exposure to the disease are also relevant to the diagnosis (HA Guideline on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2003). The main modes of transmission are by droplets and direct contact with patient's secretion, excreta and formites.",

To prevent patients picking up infection from carers, visitors and patients of general hospitals, to which they might be transferred temporarily for medical problem, outside hospital activities like outings and activities that involved volunteers and relatives were suspended since March. Relatives were advised to suspend taking the patients out for home leave temporarily. An isolation ward \u2013 SARS Quarantine Unit, was established to accommodate patients who had close contact with SARS patients or returned from a general hospital or from home leave on 29 April 2003. The ward area was divided into clean, warm and hot zones. Clean zone was the area that patients would not enter while the warm zone was the area that patient might occasionally visited. The area that patient would frequently access was the hot zone such as the dormitory. To operate the unit, a work force was formed and staff were deployed from other wards and unit to deliver 24\u2010h care there.

On the same day in Singapore, a Singaporean man had tested positive for SARS in the first new case of the disease in 4 months. Other than SARS, the threat of new infectious disease is never ending. There should be a proven effective infection control system in place to cope with any sudden onset of infectious disease especially in institutions for patients with ID. Putting into practice all infection control precautionary measures is the responsibility of the health care workers themselves. A good infection control system should include comprehensive operational infection control procedures, human resources deployment plan, infection control standards and audits, staff education and training and material resources. All health care workers should work according to the standards as laid down. Moreover, the system should be reviewed and updated regularly.
