Among hospitalized patients most infections were among children (<1 year) and older adults (\u226565 years).1, 2, 5 Older hospitalized adults demonstrated high morbidity and had the highest resource utilization, despite having a similar risk of severe disease as young children.

Data collected by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) and analyzed by the CDC place New York's RSV seasonality window as mid\u2010November to February.18 Both our community and hospital data exhibited peak infections during this window for three consecutive years. However, recent NREVSS data suggest that surveillance using PCR assays as opposed to antigen based testing demonstrates an earlier onset of RSV detection both nationally as well as in New York.19 Similarly, we saw the initial rise of RSV infections beginning well before the projected start to the RSV season.20 For children, detection began to increase in September and for adults in October. While studies suggest that adults often acquire RSV from children21 and in our study most index cases in the community cohort were among school\u2010age children further emphasizing their potential role in spreading RSV, other congregate settings such as nursing homes or public gatherings could contribute to later RSV detection in adults.5 The AAP recommends administering Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, to high risk infants and young children for 5 months during the RSV season, beginning in November.22 Based on our data, severe disease cases peaked in mid\u2010November and early December, suggesting that increased surveillance of RSV cases in New York may be warranted to help with Palivzumab timing. In addition, given the high cost and burden of administering Palivzumab monthly, a barrier to widespread use, work toward an RSV vaccine remains important. The disproportionate burden of severe RSV illness among both young children and older adults highlight two potential target populations for RSV vaccination.",

The community cohort was primarily Latino and lived in a low\u2010income, urban neighborhood; thus, the community findings may not be generalizable to a broader population. Also, the clinical features and resource utilization of the community cohort were captured solely by interview and could not be verified by medical\u2010record documentation. While the hospital and community cohort are in the same geographic area, no one from the community cohort was hospitalized during the study period, potentially due to the relatively smaller sample size. In addition, findings from the hospital group likely reflect referral center bias; however, patterns were similar when assessing just those from the catchment\u2010area. Also, due to EMR limitations, we were unable to abstract accurate data on all types of respiratory\u2010support, calculate percent positive by age or analyze the results of chest X\u2010rays in the hospitalized group. In addition, by narrowing our selectivity to RSV\u2010positive RVP within \u00b1 2 days of admission and collecting data on resource utilization with \u00b1 2 days of positive RVP, we may have underestimated the true burden of RSV among hospitalized patients.
