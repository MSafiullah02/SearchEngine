Although the use of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 instead of the unmodified one has resulted in improved therapeutic effectiveness, the sustained virological response is still poor (41\u201355%); moreover, in some cases, significant side effects can be caused.4 Therefore, more efficacious therapies are urgently required for ensuring public health.5\n",

Particularly, Valopicitabine, a prodrug of 1c, is currently in phase II clinical trials.8 Recently, the anti-HCV properties of 4\u2032-substituted ribonucleosides such as 4 have also been reported by the Roche group.6d Concerning the antiviral mechanism of common nucleoside analogues, it is known that most of these analogues are converted to their corresponding 5\u2032-triphosphates by cellular and/or viral enzymes and then compete with natural triphosphates as substrates for incorporation into viral nucleic acids during viral replication.9 Therefore, the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group is indispensable to the anti-HCV activity of these nucleoside analogues.10\n",

In the case of compound 18, conventional conditions (trimethylbenzoyl chloride, DMAP, and pyridine) required a long reaction time and led to the gradual decomposition of 9 and 18, probably because the 6-chloropurine moiety reacted with the amine bases by degrees due to its electrophilic nature. This side reaction was slightly suppressed by the use of a low-nucleophilic base, N,N-diisopropylethylamine instead of pyridine and DMAP.",

The monoacetate 33, which was prepared from 26 by employing a partly modified Santaniello\u2019s procedure,15 was converted to the silyl ether 34 in 94% yield. The use of a mixed solvent (pyridine\u2013DMF) effectively reduced the competitive silylation of the 6-amino group. Protection of the amino group with pivaloyl chloride followed by the removal of the acetyl group in 35 afforded 36 with a 98% yield in two steps. The addition of DMAP and MeOH in the N-pivaloylation step was effective in converting the N,N-dipivaloylated by-product to the desired 35. Chemoselective benzylation of the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group in 36 was successfully carried out by using 2.5 equiv of potassium tert-butoxide and 1.1 equiv of benzyl bromide in THF to provide 37 in 97% yield. After the removal of the pivaloyl group (76% yield), the resultant amino group of 38 was substituted with a chloro group to provide 39, which was subsequently deprotected to afford 20 with a 34% yield in two steps.

Among them, the 2\u2032- deoxyribonucleoside derivative 10 exhibited the highest potency against the HCV replicon with an EC50 of 6.1 \u03bcM, which is ninefold potent over that of ribavirin, and a CC50 of 111 \u03bcM. Additionally, the 5\u2032-O-benzoyl analogue 10 was more potent than the corresponding unprotected analogue 9 (EC50: 6.1 \u03bcM (5\u2032-OBz, 10) vs 47.2 \u03bcM (5\u2032-OH, 9)). This trend was also observed in the acyclic analogues 13 and 14 (EC50: 13.3 \u03bcM (\u2212OBz, 14) vs 80.8 \u03bcM (\u2212OH, 13)). In contrast, in case of the ribofuranosyl structure, the 5\u2032-hydroxyl analogue 7 was slightly more potent as compared with the 5\u2032-O-benzoyl analogue 8 (EC50\n = 31.0 and 41.0 \u03bcM, respectively). These results indicate the importance of the masked 5\u2032-hydroxyl group in the 2\u2032-deoxyribofuranosyl structure. It is also interesting to note that the 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleoside derivative 10 was more potent than the corresponding ribonucleoside derivatives such as 7 and 8 in spite of the fact that HCV is an RNA virus and most of the anti-HCV agents bear ribofuranosyl structures (or their bioisosteres).6, 7\n",

Among these compounds, the EC50 value of the close structural analogue 17 (p-methoxybenzoyl analogue) was comparable to that of 10 (EC50\n = 8.4 and 6.1 \u03bcM, respectively); however, 17 led to an undesirable increase in cytotoxicity (CC50\n = 76.4 \u03bcM). Notably, other types of protective groups such as ether groups (compounds 20 and 21) and a sulfonate group (compound 19) also exhibited good anti-HCV activity (EC50\n = 17.7, 24.5, and 28.8 \u03bcM, respectively).

One is the 5\u2032-O-masked 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine analogue itself such as 10, and the other is the deprotected 9 (or its activated form, 5\u2032-triphosphate) since carboxylic ester bonds are often hydrolyzed in cultured cells, as reported earlier.18 However, the chemically stable 5\u2032-O-masked analogues 20 and 21 (Bn and allyl ether, respectively) showed anti-HCV potency to some extent. Moreover, the deoxyadenosine derivative 23, which would be transformed to the inactive 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine after the hydrolysis, also showed potency. Thus, taking these results into consideration, it would be reasonable to consider that some 5\u2032-O-masked analogues themselves possess the anti-HCV potency. On the other hand, it would also be reasonable to consider that compound 9 (or its 5\u2032-triphosphate) is one of the real active species since 9 also exhibited anti-HCV activity, though only moderately; in other words, compound 10 operates as a prodrug of 9.19 Therefore, at this stage, we believe that both compounds (e.g., 9 and 10) would function as the species with antiviral activity in the cells.",
