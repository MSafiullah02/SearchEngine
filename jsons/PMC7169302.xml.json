The term apoptosis, from Greek origins (apo=for, ptosis=falling), was chosen to describe the cellular process of programmed cell death.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n Apoptosis is a tightly regulated intracellular program in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cell's DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins.\n4\n Programmed cell death eliminates unwanted cells or potentially reactive cell lines either before or after maturation. This process is vital to fetal and embryonic development and to tissue remodeling.\n3\n Cell populations that normally have a high rate of proliferation, such as the intestinal epithelium, depend upon apoptosis to maintain the necessary number of cells.\n5\n The number of activated immune cells must be controlled to contain the inflammatory response.\n6\n, \n7\n Hormone\u2010dependent apoptosis occurs during estrus and causes prostatic atrophy after castration.\n8\n\n",
