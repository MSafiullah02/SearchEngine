Diabetes diminishes immune function, which contributes to a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection requiring intensive care and a higher fatality rate than is associated with people who do not have diabetes.1, 2, 3 Glycaemic control can also be challenging with COVID-19, placing more burden on a fatigued health-care system. Simultaneously, people with diabetes cannot receive standard care because of resource diversion towards COVID-19. Key challenges for diabetes care during the pandemic include reduced access to health care, education, investigations, monitoring supplies, medications, and vaccinations. Furthermore, isolation measures result in increased food intake, reduced physical activity, irregular schedules translating to glycaemic deterioration, and increased anxiety and depression.",

Diabetes in Qatar has an earlier age of disease onset and complications than is seen in western populations.4 To tackle the serious challenge of COVID-19 and diabetes, Qatar has established a programme to mobilise resources to ensure that people with diabetes are protected through a coordinated collaborative team response across primary and secondary care. People with diabetes have been provided with a helpline to support diabetes care and mental health. An ongoing media campaign for patient guidance on COVID-19 and diabetes has been initiated, reinforced through direct text messages regarding COVID-19 measures, sick day rules, self-monitoring, medication management, diabetes complications, lifestyle, psychological health, and Ramadan fasting. By use of electronic medical records, patients with poor diabetes control (Glycated haemoglobin A1c >8%) who are treated with insulin and aged older than 50 years will be initially engaged through teleconsultations by physicians and diabetes educators. These teleconsultations aim to improve glycaemic control by diabetes medication optimisation and to reinforce adherence to lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications. A key aspect of the programme is optimising vitamin D to protect against acute respiratory infection.5 Home delivery has been set up for medications and supplies. The programme has been facilitated by an established and successful national diabetes strategy. Collaboration with industry will facilitate access to both diabetes supplies and mobile apps for remote patient monitoring.",
