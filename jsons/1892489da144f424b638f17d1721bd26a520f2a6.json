In this study, a single large jejunal lymph node was identified with ultrasound in all ferrets; additional smaller lymph nodes in the vicinity of the jejunal lymph node may have represented smaller jejunal lymph nodes, ileocolic lymph nodes and/or colic lymph nodes. The mean jejunal lymph node thickness in this study (5\u00b728 \u00b11\u00b766 mm) was similar to the previously reported mean of 5\u00b73 mm by Garcia et al .

Because the jejunal lymph node was serpentine, segmented linear measurements were summed to determine the total length. Although the specific technique was not described in the previous studies, presumably a single linear measurement was previously performed along the long axis of the largest part of the lymph node. This presumed difference in technique would account for the length measurements in this study being greater than previously reported. In general, lymph node thickness measurements and short-to-long axis ratios may have more clinical utility than evaluation of length measurements alone. When lymph nodes enlarge, they tend to become more rounded, having a greater short-to-long axis ratio; this change is attributed to a greater increase in thickness measurements compared to length measurements (de Swarte et al . 2011 ) . In humans and dogs, evaluation of the short-to-long axis ratio may assist in differentiating benign versus malignant neoplastic lymphadenopathies; a greater short-to-long axis ratio is associated with neoplastic lymphadenopathy while a lesser short-to-long axis ratio is associated with normal and reactive or inflammatory lymphadenopathies (Nyman et al . 2004 , de Swarte et al . 2011 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 203, "text": "(Paul-Murphy et al . 1999", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 204, "end": 225, "text": ", Garcia et al . 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 226, "end": 243, "text": ", Evans & An 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 638, "end": 661, "text": "Garcia et al .
