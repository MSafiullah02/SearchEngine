Implementation is meant to conform to respect for dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the UN Charter, and States are expected to mobilise resources and provide support to develop, strengthen and maintain public health capacity.",

The international community, including the WHO, has been extremely slow to react, failing to do so until two American aid workers and a Spanish priest were infected. It took months for the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern under the IHR 2005 [28], and longer still to issue its Ebola Response Roadmap. Developed countries like the UK and USA have responded with military intervention [73, 85], which can hardly put local populations at ease, and the handling of the American cases has been roundly criticised [35].",

Though acknowledging that the reasons will be myriad, it argues that they are almost certainly connected to two phenomena: (1) the ghettoization of global public health as an international policy sphere, with key public health advocates and policy bodies politically marginalised; and (2) the disjointed character and uncoordinated nature of the global public health framework that has evolved (perhaps in part as a result of the first phenomenon). After exploring these phenomena, this paper offers a theoretical foundation for global public health moving forward, elucidating the idea of global health justice. Finally, it articulates how we might reorient global public health as a core agenda item for international law and policy so that we might better and more quickly achieve improved health on an equitable basis. In doing so, it focuses on moral values, institutional reform/reaffirmation, and normative law-making.",

Failure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals has been attributed, at least in part, to the financial, energy, and climate-change crises of the last 15 years, all of which are directly related to economics and development, or which have significant impacts for same (UNGA [93]. These crises, like many of our social goals and policies, were both created and responded to by stakeholders outwith the health sector even though, as observed by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, they had and continue to have a direct impact on health [19]. In short, with their urgency and potential to ruin (and make) fortunes, these policy targets have side-lined and syphoned funds away from health-oriented organisations and their policy agendas and programmes. Such has permitted, or rather is indicative of, a neoliberal perspective with a relatively narrow value-base which suffuses our public institutions and dominates our international politics, including the politics that impact directly and profoundly on health.",

The eclipse of the WHO in the 1980 s, together with the rise of the WTO, through its many normative instruments,6 as a central definer (shaper and limiter) of health policy has been critical to the impoverishment of global public health as a policy target [2, 74, 91, 107]. Although some of the WTO\u2019s instruments contain provisions preserving national competencies to protect life and health,7 they are difficult to access in practice (Abbott 1 No. 14; [18], and trade harmonisation is doing more to force standards down around the world than to raise them up because these instruments require uniform standards that are least restrictive [23, 105]. Ultimately, they erode the ability of international, national, local public health officials to guide and to take measures in support of public health, and they shift public spending to areas other than public health. They also, importantly, limit the space for discussions around public health and the critically important principle of international equity [84].",

The neoliberal perspective also assumes that socially useful innovation will follow privately-determined investment. However, much health investment tends toward health technologies and other (high cost) propertised treatment interventions rather than toward more expensive but more widely enjoyed and difficult-to-measure infrastructure interventions that impact on the social determinants of health (e.g., clean water, sanitation, minimum shelter, access to nutritious food), or low-cost and simple measures to combat disease (i.e., malaria netting, etc.), which means that investments have much more limited and discrete impacts.

While the objectives of these actors are undoubtedly valuable, their perspectives are mostly narrow and their actions discretely targeted, often siloed by disease.

However, the WHO has declined in eminence and vision since its post-war foundation, and, rather than fight that slide, it has settled into the rather limited role of evidence-collector and technical advisor [30]. Indeed, in the context of the Ebola crisis, WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, described the WHO as a \u2018technical agency\u2019, a lamentable admission. In any event, its frailties are such that it has rarely influenced areas of public policy external to health even when they are closely linked to health, and the areas of trade and intellectual property are instructive (Schaffer et al. 2005). While one must concede that the WHO, even properly funded and politically ambitious, would not have the capacity to participate in every policy action impacting on health, it still must be said that the WHO has not offered the strong leadership that it should, and that global public health needs and deserves.",

It states that good health enables and enhances all sorts of human activities, and reports that escalating treatment costs are placing unsustainable burdens on healthcare resources.

The prevailing state of play has led to observations that our international political order is \u2018deformed\u2019 due to acute and unjustified disparities in power between both institutions and states [46].30 The WHO has a responsibility to resist that deformity, and a binding convention might be a way to initiate that resistance.",

For example, it should influence which considerations are deemed sufficient and which interests are deemed just when adopting courses of action through law. When it comes to considerations of international distributive justice, it should demand that actors take account of the processes by which states and institutions work to distribute material resources relating to health (as opposed to focusing narrowly on finance, as has been the traditional approach) [9]. That this has not happened is a testament to the limits of the law, particularly when political wills are focused on another direction. Nonetheless, the explicit recognition of this right in multiple international instruments combined with increased recognition (by courts, for example) that the right can and will result in obligations to act, should fortify those seeking to advance global public health. Actors need to take and make space to open discussions about values like solidarity and equity and about improved mechanisms for operationalising them. The WHO has an important role to play in this movement, and it should take steps to improve its own and its partners\u2019 structures and processes, and additionally move the international community toward a binding convention on global public health so that justice can finally be a hope for those who currently have little.",

While many factors have contributed to our failure to respond promptly and with compassion to the suffering of others, both generally and in relation to crises like this, I have argued that there are two critical factors. One is the dominant ideology which has marginalised global public health and health institutions. Another is the fragmented and disjointed quality of the global public health sector; its institutions lack integration and coordination, and its instruments lack scope. These realities have led to observations that:\u2026 [T]oday and every day, people will die and lives will not be improved because of the way global health is governed and implemented [26].\n",

I am also aware that the latter have in fact served as key barriers to success and justice in this field. That must not stop us from developing sound programmes of action that can be discussed and potentially taken up by political and policy actors; in this regard, the third of [62] salient characteristics of human rights is relevant (i.e., that the recommendations, in this case, short of implementation, can serve as a standard of critique and debate).",
