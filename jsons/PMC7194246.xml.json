            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus that has been first identified in China in winter 2019 as the cause of a severe inflammatory coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) of the respiratory tract. Because its genome is closest related to previously identified CoVs in bats, SARS-CoV-2 was originally thought to represent a zoonosis. However, its rapid spread in the human population suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is surprisingly well adapted to the human host hence behaving like a new member of the community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs). Similar to other CARVs, the clinical presentation can range from a- and oligosymptomatic to full-blown influenza-like illness and primary viral pneumonia. For the purpose of these clinical recommendations, manifestations of upper respiratory tract infectious disease are diagnosed if there is at least one of the following: cough, coryza, sore throat, shortness of breath AND a systemic symptom/sign such as fever/malaise/myalgia AND laboratory confirmation by nucleic acid testing (NAT). Conversely, lower respiratory tract infectious disease (LRTID) is diagnosed in patients with tracheitis and bronchitis, whereby dyspnea and/or declining oxygen saturation at ambient air often predict bi-lateral ground glass infiltrates seen earliest on CT-scans, hence identifying viral pneumonia. Notably, LRTID may occur early or late in the course and may rapidly progress to life-threatening respiratory failure because of massive impairment of gas-exchange. In addition, multi-organ failure affecting renal and cardiac function have been described. This life-threatening complication is thought to be due to a hyperinflammatory process compatible with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [1, 2] in addition to hypercoagulopathy leading to pulmonary embolism [3].",

Of note, the peak of clinical disease is in the 2nd week with an increase in inflammation [7]. It is not clear if cancer is a general risk factor for infection [6, 8, 9], but old age, hypertension, and diabetes have clearly been defined as risk factors for worse outcome [7]. Cancer patients should also be assumed to have a worse prognosis [8] and preliminary experience from Italy suggests that mortality in patients with hematological malignancy may be as high as 20% (Livio Pagano, personal communication). However, with regard to the present or upcoming outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 accurate estimates regarding mortality and spread are almost impossible to give since most factors influencing the epidemiology are still unknown [10].",

In this setting it appears wise to implement center-specific standard-operating-procedures to define altered responsibilities and access to care. Depending on the magnitude of changes within a certain region, prioritization with regard to anti-cancer therapy may be necessary to ensure the safe administration of potentially dangerous and toxic treatments. An example of these changed working conditions may be that centers may automatically admit all patients presenting with febrile temperature to an area dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. If, however, a cancer patient treated in the outpatient clinic presents with febrile neutropenia and is admitted to the COVID-19 dedicated area, the cancer patient may actually be at higher risk and not receive the adequate therapy within the required time frame in this emergency setting. It seems advisable to envisage the situation of delivering care in a COVID-19-dedicated area during the time of the most profound immunosuppression caused by anti-cancer treatment. Some elective therapies leading to profound immunosuppression later on may be re-evaluated under the consideration that the management of complications may be hampered because of emergency measures. On the other hand, it is vital to ensure appropriate cancer therapy as much as possible, especially in patients with curative options and rapid proliferation of their disease. Therefore, the individual situation of cancer patients needs to be considered when implementing emergency measures.",

This is mostly due to the fact that cancer patients as well as healthy individuals are immunologically naive to this novel pathogen. Regarding the course of the infection, underlying malignant disease has not been identified as an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis so far [7]. However, severely immunosuppressed patients generally have a higher risk of developing complications in CARV infections [11] and it should be assumed that cancer patients are at risk of a more severe course of COVID-19 as well [8]. In the absence of more specific data, potential risk factors for a severe course of the disease should be assumed as for other CARV-infections: severe immunodeficiency, lymphopenia, long and profound neutropenia, and older age [11]. As lymphopenia is a risk factor for LRTID and mortality in CARV infections in SCT-recipients and SARS-CoV-2 appears to cause or be associated with lymphopenia, patients with pre-existing severe lymphopenia (<0.2 \u00d7 109/L) may in time be shown to have an increased risk for a severe course of COVID-19 as well [7, 11]. Clinicians should also be aware that cancer patients generally shed CARV longer than immunocompetent people [12] and this is probably true for this novel coronavirus as well.",

Also, clinicians should be aware of the fact that termination of some drugs, for example ruxolitinib, may have devastating effects in terms of a rebound of symptoms [22]. On the other hand, some therapies are associated with significant cytopenias and toxicities which must be assumed as a risk factor for the adverse outcome of COVID-19. In addition, as stated above lymphopenia is likely a specific risk factor for adverse outcome [7]. Therefore, the administration of drugs inhibiting B cells like monoclonal antibodies against CD20 is possibly harmful and should be critically evaluated. Also, drugs associated with hypersensitivity-phenomena may aggravate COVID-19-induced hypersensitivity-pneumonitis [23]. Therefore, interruptions of some therapies may seem prudent in patients presenting with symptoms of RTID. In general, recommendations regarding the management of potential infectious complications of novel and targeted therapies should be observed [24, 25].",

Therefore, it is very important to implement standardized sampling and to repeat tests in patients with unexpected results to avoid bias by pre-analytical mistakes. For diagnosis of LRTID in patients with CARV infection including SARS-CoV-2, CT scans should be used rather than chest X-ray [29\u201331].

However, recent reports on COVID-19 suggest a benefit of steroid treatment [34] and low-dose steroid (<1 mg/kg/day for 3 days) has been described in an immunosuppressed patient [35].
