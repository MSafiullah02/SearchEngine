The client's basic condition, blood gas results, nucleic acid testing and extent of pulmonary secretions should be taken into consideration. The primary focus should be on limiting environmental contamination by aerosol spread of the virus. Four criteria were added which became indicators for use of bronchoscopy in the care of a patient with COVID-19: \u2460 receiving mechanical ventilation, \u2461 severe atelectasis found on chest x-ray revealing a large area of reduced transparency in both lung tissues, \u2462 suctioning does not clear secretions and PO2\u226440 mmHg, \u2463 throat swab is negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nuclei acid but patient was highly suspected for COVID-19.
