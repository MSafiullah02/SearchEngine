Specifically, a substantial number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, with or without mild symptoms, are key to its effective dissemination throughout populations, including to healthcare providers. 9 At times of documented or suspected community spread of COVID-19, it is reasonable suspect that ALL patients could be carriers of the virus. As such, ALL patients should be considered COVID-19 suspects, regardless of testing availability or results, and all patients should be treated equally with precautions similar to those used in COVID-19 confirmed cases. This approach is similar to the concept of universal precautions. This level of safety may not be required if community transmission and the burden of cases is low in specific areas. However, to minimize infectious risk to healthcare providers of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the pre, intra, and post-operative period, additional detailed protective strategies are suggested. These are guidance recommendations during a pandemic surge for ALL patients until the supply chain for personal protective equipment (PPE)",

All OR staff are required to practice enhanced droplet and contact precautions (EDCP) in the operating room at all times. This includes the use of N95 respirator, eye protection, gown and gloves. Given the possibility of false negative testing (10 -30 %) 11 the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) recommends that all anesthesia professionals should utilize PPE appropriate for AGPs for all patients, during all diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures, when working near the airway. 12 We would broaden this recommendation to include all OR personnel. 5 . If N95 masks are to be reused, (though not optimal) the ASA and CDC recommend a 5-day period of drying 13 or preferably decontamination using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or moist heat by autoclaving. 14,15 6. If a PAPR is utilized as an alternative to a N95 respirator and eye protection, practitioners should be cautioned that these devices may reduce the clarity of surgical loupes and positioning of headlights. 12.

The amount of time that aerosols stay suspended in the air will depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an AGP was performed. General guidance on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available from the CDC. 18 17. Following the standoff period, the OR suite must be cleaned using routine procedures with EPA-approved hospital disinfectant 18. Surgeries should be performed by the most experienced available surgeons and assistants to limit exposure time in the OR. Junior residents and other learners should not be exposed unless absolutely necessary. 19 . Strong consideration to surgical approach and technique must be considered to optimize patient outcomes while minimizing exposure risk to providers. Use of laparoscopic or videoassisted thoracoscopic procedures should be avoided when possible due to risk of aerosolization from C0 2 insufflation systems with inadvertent lung injury. 24. TEE in an intubated, anesthetized patient has never been demonstrated to generate aerosols. However, many societies have classified TEE as an AGP. Clinicians should weigh the necessity of placing a TEE in each cardiac surgical patient against the theoretical concern of generating aerosols. If performed, all staff should wear a N95 mask. The most experienced echocardiographer should perform the examination, including probe insertion/removal. 20",

Positive screening tests should lead to reconsideration of the risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery. These patients may be in the pre or early symptomatic phase of infection and are likely at heightened risk of adverse outcomes following surgery. In a retrospective cohort study of 34 patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19, the mortality rate was 20%. 28 However, negative screening tests must be interpreted with caution, particularly in the setting of a) low pre-test probability; b) typically low viral titers in the asymptomatic phase and; c) the possibility of false negatives. If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains (due to exposure history, active symptoms, high prevalence of circulating community infections, or other clinical factors), repeat testing may be indicated during the postoperative course.",

Limit entry/exit to a single operating room (OR) entrance. Keep all OR doors closed as much as possible and limit staff entry/re-entry to keep OR pressures and air exchanges regulated.9. Before AGPs are performed, OR personnel must ensure that no more than the minimal number of staff required to safely achieve the procedure are present in the room.10. During induction and endotracheal intubation, it is recommended that the anesthesiologist: a. Be the most experienced available operator with the highest probability of first pass intubation. b. Limit the number of staff in the OR to the minimum needed to safely intubate (1 anesthesiologist plus 1 or 2 assistants).c.

This requires strict adherence to enhanced contact and droplet precautions. No patient interaction should be permitted before full PPE is donned.
