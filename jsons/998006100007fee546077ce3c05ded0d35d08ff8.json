We also argue that dividing the population into non-interacting groups leads to an effective reduction of the transmission rates. As in any compartmental model, the goal of this article is to provide qualitative understanding rather than exact quantitative predictions.",

Indeed, it is now almost a century since William Ogilvy Kermack and Anderson Gray McKendrick introduced the well known SIR model, [MK] , on which most compartmental modeling elaborates on. Their relevance stems for their extreme simplicity and ability to capture important qualitative behaviors, rather than their limited capacity to make quantitative predictions. As a matter of fact, the current outbreak of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is teaching us that most models, not only the compartmental ones, are of very limited quantitative predictive capacity. Nevertheless, there are important qualitative features of outbreaks that one may attempt to capture, for instance: under which conditions can one guarantee that there will be only one peak? This stands as a very important question which ought to be answered if one is to effectively prevent a second, or third wave of infections. Specially, having in mind the concerns to be taken once a first wave have passed. The goal of this article is to propose and analyze some compartmental models which have been constructed to capture some important features of diseases such as COVID-19. Its two major characteristics which are not captured by the standard compartmental models are:",

For instance, using the more refined model we give in Corollary 1 and Remark 11 a quantitative condition ensuring only one peak will form. The broad conclusion is that if all transmission rates are kept sufficiently small, then only one peak form, which answers item (a) of question 2. If this condition is not met, more peaks can form as we show in example 5 and these can be higher, thus answering items (b) and (c) of question 2 above.

For instance, how can we predict by how much the use of masks by the general population reduces the rate of transmission? or washing hands? Indeed, it is impossible to say it a-priori. We only know that these measures do reduce the rate of transmission but not by how much. Having this in mind, we propose one further measure whose contribution to the reduction of the transmission rate can be quantified using the models. The \"idea\" is to split the population into n different groups which are supposed to never interact, this reduces the contact rate of any individual by a factor of n thus reducing the overall transmission rates by a factor of n. This intuitive argument can be made more precise using the models we use. The last section of this article, Section 5, is dedicated to making such an argument and running a simulation. We shall also explain how this relates to our answer to the questions 1 and 2 above.",

Once we are through the worst part of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak with relative success, meaning that only a small fraction of the population got infected and so we cannot count with group immunity, the question we must pose is: How can we proceed and go back to a relative normality so that a putative second wave is as mild as possible? I hope that the answers to question 2 above, stated as Proposition 2 and as Corollary 1 depending on the model, may serve as good indication that it is possible, but difficult, to have only one peak. They quantify and show what one could already suspect, that the way to do so is to reduce all the transmission rates. It is enough that one transmission rate be high for the outbreak to be out of control, see Conclusion 6. How to keep the transmission rates small remains a formidable challenge which I do not attempt at answering. As said before, there is no way to quantify how most policies reduce the transmission rates. In that direction Section 5 explains a strategy, which may be difficult to implement, but whose effect on the transmission rate can be pined down.",

I do believe it cannot be literally implemented in a society which respects our civil liberties and so would remain at the level of a request to the population, which one would hope to be understood. Of course, in that scenario the different groups would interact, even if mildly. Having such considerations into account leads to modifications of the proposed solutions which will consequently modify the models one should use into mathematically more intractable ones. We may hope that the increased mathematical sophistication of those models will not lead to substantially different qualitative outcomes but instead quantitative ones. In any case, one must understand that the models are simply that: attempts to model a reality which is much more complex. They are, by no means, a truthful reflection of the real world.",

It is at the date medically impossible to determine the values of all these and so it is meaningless to assign them specific values and pretend we are modeling the true outbreak. Nevertheless, I must justify the values I will be assigning in my model. I shall suppose that \u03b2 i < \u03b2 e < \u03b2 a , and recall that these encode the number of infections that the infected, exposed and asymptomatic cause by unit time. This choice may seem strange but there is a reason for this choice. I assume that the infected, while possibly being extremely infectious, are dealt with carefully and so do not infect as many other people by unit time as the exposed and asymptomatic. This justifies \u03b2 i < \u03b2 a and also \u03b2 i < \u03b2 e . The exposed, even though not having been detected yet, are not as infectious as they will eventually become later thus \u03b2 e < \u03b2 a . Notice that we do not have \u03b2 e < \u03b2 i as the infected individuals will be detected and dealt with in a way that avoids further infections. Without this extra care that inequality would hold. From all this we then have: \u03b2 i < \u03b2 e < \u03b2 a , as claimed. Next, we shall assume in our simulations that \u03b3 i < \u03b3 a which means that the average time \u03b3 \u22121 a an asymptomatic individual takes to reduce its viral charge to zero is smaller than the time an infected indivual needs \u03b3 \u22121 i .

As a matter of showing the importance of the quantity 4.7 we shall plot this in figure 9 which we can see has two large plateaus, well above 1, connected by a region where it is substantially smaller. The simulation run for these values is presented in figure 10 and is made with the initial conditions S(0) = 0.99, E(0) = 0.01, I(0) = 0 = R(0). One sees that the first peak is too small for a sufficient fraction of the population to acquire immunity and the high increase of the rate of transmissions, here enconded in the quantity 4.7 leads to a second peak of the outbreak. Indeed, this second wave of the outbreak creates an even larger peak than the first. Of course, the actual values of the transmission rates we used in this example may not be well adapted for a realistic modeling. 3 Nevertheless, this serves as an example to stress the possibility of having a second outbreak that may be worse than the first. As a way of comparison, and to further investigate on the role of asymptomatic carriers, we present in figure 11 a simulation of the same model except that we now have a much higher fraction of asymptomatic carriers, in this case a a = 0.8 and a i = 0.2. This means that each individual has a 80 per cent probability of becoming asymptomatic when exposed to the disease. In this case, we see that the large quantity of asymptomatic carriers keeps the peaks of infection much smaller. In fact, we also find that in this case the second peak is smaller. This can be interpreted in terms of the herd immunity acquired by the asymptomatic carriers which shields the rest of population while keeping the number of infections smaller. . Figure 10 .

One possible definition is that the asymptotic value os susceptibleS c := lim t\u2192+\u221e S(t),is large. Alternatively, we may attempt at keeping the total number of infected people, as possible. The proof of Lemma 2 show that these two definitions are equivalent for the model 3.1-3.4. However, in model at hand there is the possibility that as susceptible passes to the recovered state taking the asymptomatic route which makes this model fundamentally different. Indeed, from integrating the first equation 4.1 we find that S(t) = S(0) exp \u2212 t 0 (\u03b2 i I + \u03b2 e E + \u03b2 a A)ds .",
