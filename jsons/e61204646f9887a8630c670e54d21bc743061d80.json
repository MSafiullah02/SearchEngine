The modelling results suggest that the spleens capability to function as a sink for the virus produced in peripheral target organs remains operational as long as viral mutations do not permit accelerated growth in peripheral tissues. Importantly, the mathematical model of MHV infection can be used to evaluate the limits of protection against severe disease for increasing virus replication rates. Since various MHV strains display significant differences in their ability to replicate in different organs, two complementary scenarios were considered: the increase in virus growth rate in the peripheral organs (liver) versus secondary lymphoid organs (spleen). Figure 4 .25 A shows that pDCs in spleen provide very limited protection against severe disease for faster replicating strains of the virus in hepatocytes. Indeed, only a 15% increase in the growth rate of MHV in the liver leads to infection with ALT levels rising to 10 3 IU/L within 2 days. The decrease of pDC numbers in spleen makes the situation more fragile to even smaller increases in the virus growth rate. On the contrary, pDCs provide a robust protection against severe disease when the virulence-enhancing mutation leads to faster replication only in target cells located in spleen, i.e. splenic pDCs protect against severe disease for up to 30-fold increase in the viral replication rate in splenic M\u03c6 (See Fig. 4 .25b). Taken together, these analyses indicate that the spleen represents a robust sink system able to cope with substantially enhanced virus production as long as this gain of viral fitness remains restricted to this SLO. Overall, the modelling results suggest that the pDC population in spleen ensures a robust protection against virus variants which substantially downmodulate type I IFN secretion. However, the ability of pDCs to protect against severe disease caused by virus variants exhibiting an enhanced liver tropism and higher replication rates appears to be rather limited.

To formulate a mathematical model which describes and explains the observed findings, i.e. the data on CD4 + T-cell expansion for various precursor numbers and the accompanying data sets from BrdU-and CFSE labeling kinetics, we considered the feedback-regulated balance of growth and differentiation concept by Grossman and Paul [80] [81] [82] . It was assumed that the most differentiated effectors (or memory cells) limit the growth of less differentiated effectors, locally, by increasing the rate of differentiation of the latter cells in a dose-dependent manner [4] . The biological scheme and the sequence of functionally distinct stages in cell development underlying the equations of the mathematical model is shown schematically in Fig. 4 .26.

A number of data fitting and analysis methods, including the maximum likelihood approach, Akaike information criteria, statistical model comparison methods and sensitivity analyses were used to identify a parsimonious model of the kinetics of antigen-driven CD4 + T-cell expansion (we refer to [4] for details). The set of core model equations with feedback regulation is represented in the following form: dt X 2 (t) = p 2 X 2 (t) + \u03b1 1 + \u03b1 12 1 1 + (Z 1 (t) + Z 2 (t))/\u03b8 x1", "cite_spans": [{"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Identifying a Feedback Regulating Proliferation and"}, {"text": "The consistency of the model with data on clonal expansion of CD4 + T cells starting from 300 precursors in the LNs at the time of immunization and 3 \u00d7 10 4 cells along with the evolving structure of the clones is illustrated in Fig. 4 .27.

The extent of virus (LCMV-Docile) clearance displays a threshold-type behaviour in relation to the dose of infection. The doses below 2 \u00d7 10 3 pfu are eliminated due to the CTL response, while the infections with higher doses lead to CTL exhaustion and virus persistence.It is known that some LCMV isolates (WE or Armstrong) do not induce viral persistence after high-dose i.v. infection. However, under certain conditions LCMV-WE can also establish persistent infection like in congenital LCMV-WE carrier C57BL/6", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "List of the model parameters estimated for systemic LCMV-WE infection in CB57BL/6", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter </td><td>Biological meaning </td><td>Units </td><td>Best-fit estimate\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b2 </td><td>Replication rate constant of viruses in spleen\n</td><td>1/day </td><td>4.7\n</td></tr><tr><td>Vmvc </td><td>Maximal virus concentration in spleen\n</td><td>pfu/ml </td><td>6.5 \u00d7 108\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b2 </td><td>Replication rate constant of viruses in\n</td><td>1/day </td><td>2.1\n</td></tr><tr><td>liver\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Vmvc </td><td>Maximal virus concentration in spleen\n</td><td>pfu/ml </td><td>3.0 \u00d7 108\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b3V E </td><td>Rate constant of virus clearance due to effector CTLs\n</td><td>ml/(cell day) </td><td>2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b8V E </td><td>CTL number of half-maximal virus clearance rate\n</td><td>cell/ml </td><td>2.6 \u00d7 105\n</td></tr><tr><td>E0p </td><td>Homeostatic\nconcentration of\n</td><td>cell/ml </td><td>1100\n</td></tr><tr><td>LCMV-specific CTLs in spleen of unprimed\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>mouse\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b1Ep </td><td>Rate constant of natural death for precursor CTLs\n</td><td>1/day </td><td>0.068\n</td></tr><tr><td>bp </td><td>Rate constant of CTL stimulation\n</td><td>ml/(pfu day) </td><td>2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03c4 </td><td>Duration of CTL division cycles\n</td><td>day </td><td>1.0\n</td></tr><tr><td>bd </td><td>Rate constant of CTL differentiation\n</td><td>ml/(pfu day) </td><td>2 \u00d7 10\u22122\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b8p </td><td>Cumulative viral load threshold for anergy induction in precursor CTLs (proliferation process)\n</td><td>pfu/ml </td><td>1 \u00d7 106\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b8E </td><td>Cumulative viral load threshold for anergy induction in effector CTLs (differentiation process)\n</td><td>pfu/ml </td><td>5.5 \u00d7 105\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03b1PCD </td><td>Rate constant of effector CTL death after virus clearance below a threshold\n</td><td>l/day </td><td>0.3\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "The transfer rates, i.e. the elements of compartmental matrix M, for virus and effector CTL are specified in Tables 4.3 and 4.4, respectively.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "Compartmental scheme of systemic dynamics of adoptively transferred DC and CTL.
