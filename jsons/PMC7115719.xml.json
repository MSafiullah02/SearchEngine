The mosquito vector for dengue was eradicated in most of the region as part of the Pan American Health Organization's yellow fever eradication campaign in the 1950s and 1960s. The A aegypti eradication program was officially discontinued in the United States and other Western Hemisphere regions, leading to reinfestation of the mosquito vector in most countries during the 1980s and 1990s. By 1997, the geographic distribution of A aegypti was wider than its distribution before the eradication program. Dengue is now endemic in much of the Western Hemisphere.

The mosquito eradication program, which was officially discontinued in the United States in 1970, gradually weakened elsewhere, and the mosquito began to reinfest countries from which it had been eradicated. Consequently, the geographic distribution of A aegypti in 2002 was much wider than that before the eradication program and there was a corresponding increase in dengue infections. There are 4 distinct serotypes of DENV. Primary infection with one DENV serotype provides lifelong immunity to that specific serotype. However, when an individual is infected with a different serotype of DENV, there is an increased risk of severe dengue disease.9 This can occur with all 4 serotypes; therefore, in regions with multiple endemic serotypes, the risk of severe disease is higher.",

The most common method of detecting the virus is to propagate virus from serum in cell culture or detect antidengue antibodies by serology. Virus can be cultured in vitro or by detection of viral RNA and specific dengue virus antigens. Countries that do not have access to sophisticated laboratory tests rely on identification of early clinical or simple laboratory indicators that can provide a reliable diagnosis of dengue before hospitalization.

Subunit-based vaccines, as purified proteins or DNA plasmid, are alternative vaccine strategies.
