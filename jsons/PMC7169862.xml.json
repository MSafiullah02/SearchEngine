More than 33.2 million people are currently living with this infection worldwide (http://data.unaids.org/pub/EPISlides/2007/2007epiupdate.en.pdf; http://www.nacoonline.org/NACO). The situation is particularly alarming in regions like the Sub\u2010Saharan Africa where 22 million people are infected with HIV\u20101, and the adult prevalence rate is \u223c5%. Similarly, there are 4.2 million infected people living across South East Asia. According to the recent census published by the National AIDS control organization, there are \u223c2.5 million HIV\u2010infected people residing in the Indian subcontinent with the adult prevalence rate of \u223c0.36% (http://www.nacoonline.org/NACO). The menace of HIV\u20101/AIDS has emerged as one of the biggest health hazards of today and a matter of global priority for researchers, clinicians, policy makers, social workers, and funding agencies alike. To this effect, a Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has been created by a constellation of important organizations like the UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, UNFPA, UNODC, ILO, UNESCO, WHO, and world bank. The program has committed its \u2018millennium development goal 6\u2019 as \u2018to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases\u2019 and targets \u2018to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS\u2019 by 2015.",

            "text": "According to the most widely recognized consensus, HIV\u20101 appears to have evolved from the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and was transferred from nonhuman primates to humans through zoonosis during the mid\u20101930s. After this initial transfer, the virus underwent mysterious changes and sudden mutations to evolve into HIV\u20101. It began to spread among humans across the globe and ultimately became a true epidemic. On the other hand, HIV\u20102 is relatively less transmittable and is largely confined to West Africa. It is believed that this strain may have originated from the Sooty Mangabey (Cercocebus atys), an Old World monkey residing predominantly in Guinea\u2010Bissau, Gabon, and Cameroon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_origin).",

Lack of suitable animal model systems, inherent hypervariability of the virus, and its extraordinary ability to adapt and evolve in the host are some of the major hurdles responsible for the delay in developing vaccine against HIV (Table 2). The virus has devised its own mechanisms to escape immune recognition and surveillance through extensive glycosylation and surface masking. For example, the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 possess immunogenic epitopes, but most of these are not exposed on the virus surface and therefore not available for an effector immune response. Likewise, the gp120 CD4\u2010binding site is a recessed cavity in the virus and therefore inaccessible for the antibodies. Importantly, virus infection results in downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression and effectively perturbs antigen presentation. Likewise, antibodies to gp120 CD4\u2010binding site have been reported to hinder antigen presentation and suppress gp120\u2010specific CD4 T\u2010cell responses (1). The CD4 T cells decline in number, and their response is compromised in HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients, although antigen stimulation can induce chemokine secretion and suppress HIV infection in vitro\n(2). HIV\u20101\u2010infected T cells form a virological synapse with noninfected CD4+ T cells to efficiently transfer HIV\u20101 virions from cell to cell. The viral gp120 participates in the formation of a virological synapse (3), plausibly leading to dysregulated T\u2010cell activation, which is in analogy with the immunological synapse that normally results in regulated T\u2010cell activation.",

For example, such persons have an overrepresentation of protective HLA\u2010B*57 and B*27 alleles, high ratios of functional CD4:CD8 T cells, high generalized T activation levels (CD38+DR+), high proportions of polyfunctional IL2+\u03b3IFN+ CD4+ T helpers, CD8+ CTL responses, preferential targeting of gag and env, and high HIV\u2010specific antibody levels (7). However, not all elite controllers possess these resistance factors, indicating an involvement of additional hitherto undetected restriction factors. For example, Brass et al. (8) have reported that HIV uses at least 250 host\u2010derived HIV dependency factors for gaining entry into target cells and completing its life cycle. Hence, multiple genetic factors are expected to be involved in disease pathogenesis and progression following HIV infection. A study carried out by O\u2019Brien and colleagues (9) using five different cohorts (Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study, AIDS Link to Intravenous Experience, Hemophilia Growth and Development Study, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and San Francisco City Cohort) has shown the existence of a number of \u2018AIDS restriction genes\u2019 that could determine the genetic propensity of an individual or a population and help predict survival kinetics following HIV infection 4, 5, 10.",

The CCR5 expression is upregulated under the influence of IL\u20102 and IL\u201010, while IL\u20104 induces CXCR4 expression. The chemokines CCL3 [macrophage inflammatory protein\u20101 (MIP\u20101)\u03b1], CCL4 (MIP\u20101\u03b2), and CCL5 [regulated upon activation, normally T\u2010expressed, and presumably secreted (RANTES)] are natural ligands of CCR5 coreceptor that can block entry of NSI virions. Similarly, stromal cell\u2010derived factor 1 (SDF\u20101) is a ligand for CXCR4 that is primarily used by SI viruses. Therefore, the availability of chemokine receptors expressed on cell surface and the levels of their ligands as well as cytokines are critical elements as they can enhance/suppress HIV entry. Functional genetic polymorphisms are known to occur in these proteins that affect their levels of expression and therefore might modulate their molecular interactions.",

However, this APOBEC3G\u2010mediated innate immune mechanism is counteracted by the HIV\u20101 vif, thus allowing the virus to escape through mutations and even develop drug resistance to lamivudine (3TC) (45). It has been shown that residues asp128 in APOBEC3G in humans and lys128 in African green monkeys are involved in binding with viral vif, resulting in its degradation. Furthermore, an interchange of the asp128 with lys128 in human APOBEC3G switches its sensitivity from HIV vif to SIV vif (46). APOBEC3G functions as a potent post\u2010entry restriction factor for HIV\u20101 in na\u00efve CD4 T cells but is not protective in activated CD4 T cells.
