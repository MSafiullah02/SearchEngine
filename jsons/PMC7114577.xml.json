During the manufacture of Tanreqing injection, lots of technological processes and intermediates need online monitoring or rapid analysis, such as extraction, separation, purification, and liquid preparation process, for the process control and real time release (RTR).",

Various regression algorithms have been studied, including linear regression methods, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), as well as nonlinear regression methods, such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and Gaussian process. Among these regression algorithms, partial least-square regression (PLSR) is the mostly widely used one, due to its clear and definite physical meaning, and also the compatibility of linear and nonlinear correlation between the independent variables and dependent variables. In view of the different types of relationship between X and Y, a series of PLS based regression algorithms were developed, such as linear PLS, non-linear PLS, concentration weighted PLS [7], [8], [9], and so on. As for the NIR spectral analysis, the linear and nonlinear correlations between the independent variables and dependent variables always coexist, in these cases, different kinds of regression models can be established respectively, and the net result can be obtained through the consensus of these models. It can also be viewed as consensus strategy, which differs from the consensus modeling in the traditional sense [10], [11], [12].",

Then the samples were sorted according to the Mahalanobis distance, and the samples having significant differences with the average spectra are considered as outlier samples. In this research, the results of Dixon's test were shown in Fig. 2\n. The leverage diagnostic shows the relationship between the leverage and residual values for each component and each sample in a PLSR calibration model. The leverage values reflect how much the standard is influencing the model, and the studentized residual value is the residual value of a spectrum after it has been scaled by the leverage value. The residual values plotted by the Leverage diagnostic have been divided by their standard error to produce the studentized residual value, which places all samples on a similar scale, regardless of their leverage values, and makes it easier to identify standards that may be outliers. Fig. 3\nillustrates how the leverage values compare with the studentized residual values. In the present study, we provisionally viewed the samples with significant differences as outlier samples, and then reinstated them one by one. If the model performance deteriorated after a certain sample was reinstated, then the sample was deemed to be outlier sample, and should be removed from the calibration set. Conversely, the sample was still viewed as a normal one.",

Predicted residual error sum square (PRESS), which represents the sum of square of deviation between predicted and reference values of all the samples in the LOO cross-validation decreases with the increasing of the LVs, and when the PRESS value tends to be constant or increases gradually, the optimum LV numbers is achieved [28].

Although those active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) influence directly the effects of Tanreqing injection, it would have been otherwise impractical to use them as monitoring control indices, because it is difficult to find the definite link between the operating parameters and them. Instead, SSC and TOC are also two Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the Tanreqing injection intermediates, which indicates the physical property and the chemical composition, respectively. The two CQAs need to be determined promptly and accurately during the liquid preparation process of Tanreqing injection. However, traditional analytical technology cannot meet this demand.
