Like other coronaviruses, it is a large, enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28.5 kb, belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. It is a major pathogen that replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells in the small intestine, leading to watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in piglets less than two weeks old (Enjuanes et al., 1995). The intestinal epithelial cells are the first line of defense against TGEV infection, therefore, intestinal epithelial interferon response is critical for resistance to TGEV infection.",

Double-stranded (ds) RNA that is produced by the replication of RNA virus genomes could be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in endosomes or RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) in the cytoplasm (Arpaia and Barton, 2011, Loo and Gale, 2011), which lead to the synthesis and secretion of IFNs. Consequently, the secretion of IFNs induces a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to exert antiviral effects (Wong and Chen, 2016). However, in the competition between virus and host cells, many viruses have evolved the ability to evade or suppress the antiviral immunity (Katze et al., 2002).",

Coronavirus has evolved a lot of strategies to resist the host innate immune responses, such as encoded proteins to affect type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines production (Narayanan et al., 2015, Totura and Baric, 2012). Moreover, a common feature of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses is their ability to shield dsRNA and other viral components from recognition by host PRRs by intracellular membrane rearrangements. It has been reported that coronavirus nsp16 can modify the 5\u2032 cap of coronavirus mRNAs by its 2\u2032-O-methylase activity, which makes coronavirus mRNAs indistinguishable from host mRNAs (Zust et al., 2011).",

Some studies have demonstrated that TGEV infected swine testicular (ST) cells could induce abundant IFN-\u03b2 expression (Becares et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 2013b).

Morevoer, we measured the luciferase activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter after TGEV infection at MOI of 5 or 0.01 (Fig. 1C and D). The results were similar to the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity was significantly higher after poly(I:C) transfection for 6 h in IPEC-J2 cells than that after TGEV infection at MOI of 5 (Fig. 1E). According to the results of cell viability test (Fig. S1A) and the induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig. S1B), the treatment of 1000 ng/ml poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec, a synthetic dsRNA polymer sensed by RIG-I/MDA-5, was set as IFN-\u03b2 expression positive control. Despite of the dose of infection, the peak of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was similar to that treated with 1000 ng/ml Poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec after 24 h.

To determine if IFN-\u03b2 exert antiviral activity in TGEV infection, we examined the expression of some Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mRNA of RIG-I (Fig. 3\nA), IFIT1 (Fig. 3B), IFIT44 (Fig. 3C) and ISG15 (Fig. 3D) were all up-regulated after IFN-\u03b2 high expression and higher than those treated with poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec, which indicated the type I IFN signal pathways were not blocked by TGEV infection. Interestingly, the mRNA of RIG-I, IFIT1 and IFIT44 were transiently up-regulated at 1 h and 6 h post TGEV infection while in the later infection stage (after 12 h at MOI = 5), the mRNAs of ISGs were limited and insufficient in the early infection stage. It might be induced through peroxisomal MAVS pathway, which is required for rapid but transient induction of antiviral ISGs independent of secreted IFNs (Dixit et al., 2010). These results suggested that the innate antiviral immune responses could be induced by TGEV infection. The activation of IFN responses need abundant dsRNA.",

In order to confirm whether IFN-\u03b2 inhibit TGEV replication in intestinal epithelia cells, the IPEC-J2 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec 24 h then infected with TGEV at MOI of 5 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, the replication of TGEV gRNA was significantly suppressed by poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec transfected above 5 ng/ml. In order to further analyse whether activating RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) signaling could suppress TGEV infection or not, we detected the viral gRNA, titers, and nucleocapsid (N) protein post TGEV infection at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, the viral gRNA was suppressed at 24 and 48 hpi after 500 ng/ml poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec transfection. However, the trend of titers and N protein was not similar with the viral gRNA trend (Fig. 4C\u2013E). The titers and N protein expression were suppressed by poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec transfection in the early infection stage. These data indicated that the activation of IFN-I signaling pathway might inhibit TGEV infection through suppressing protein translation and virus assembly in the early stage but fail to inhibit TGEV infection on the late infection stage.",

To specifically demonstrate the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 during TGEV infection, we tried to establish IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) knockout (KO) cell lines by gRNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 knockout strategy. Through single cell pick-up and expansion, we got several IFNAR KO ST cell lines. We also conducted the relevant experiment in IPEC-J2 cells, but did not get an IFNAR KO cell line as this cell cannot grow by single cell. To determine the efficiency of IFNAR knockout, we measured the mRNA level of IFN-\u03b2 and two ISGs after transfection with poly(I:C) in these IFNAR KO ST cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5\n, the level of IFN-\u03b2 (A) was significantly suppressed and DDX58 (B), ISG15 (C) were all completely inhibited in IFNAR2-6, 7, 9 ST cell lines. Therefore, we chose IFNAR2-6 as a successful IFNAR KO ST cell line, while the IFNAR1-3 as a plasmid transfection control. Moreover, we measured the activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter and ISRE (interferon-stimulated response elements) by Luc-based reporter assays. Though, it was shown that the level of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 5D) increases slightly induced by poly(I:C), the activity of ISRE (Fig. 5E) was completely inhibited in IFNAR2-6 cells, which indicated IFN-I responses were blocked. We measured the titer of TGEV after infection for 12 h in IFNAR KO ST cells transfected with or without poly(I:C). As shown in Fig. 5F, the replication of TGEV in IFNAR2-6 cells was similar to that in IFNAR1-3 cells or ctrl cells and it has no difference in IFNAR2-6 cells transfected with or without poly(I:C), while poly(I:C) transfection can inhibit the replication of TGEV completely in ST ctrl cells or IFNAR1-3 cells. Therefore, we can get the conclusion directly that the antiviral activity of IFN-I during TGEV infection is limited.",

We showed that TGEV infection lead to a considerable activation of the type I IFN response in IPEC-J2 cells. However, the level of IFN-\u03b2 was still very low even after 12 h TGEV infection (Fig. 1A), while the level of TGEV titer almost get to the peak at the same time (Fig. 2C). Consequently, the production of IFN-\u03b2 delayed with respect to the peak of viral titer. In addition, TGEV alone could effectively promote IFN-\u03b2 induction and TGEV could enhance IFN-\u03b2 production induced by poly(I:C) transfection (Fig. S2), though it could not suppress the replication of TGEV in the early stage. Finally, we demonstrated that the activation of IFN responses induced by TGEV infection cannot inhibit viral replication (Fig. 5F). Taken together, this study provides the novel analysis of the interplay between TGEV and the type I IFN response in porcine intestinal epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Diseases caused by coronavirus is a hot research topic in recent years, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED). Because of various structural proteins and non-structural proteins, there are complex interactions between coronavirus and host cells especially for the innate immune response (Kindler and Thiel, 2014, Fung and Liu, 2014). The innate immune system is the first line of defense against virus infection, especially type I interferon antiviral response. Type I interferon (IFN), often triggered by viral infection, could broadly stimulate antiviral cytokine and inflammatory cytokines expression (Katze et al., 2008). However, induction of IFN expression is often failed in coronavirus infection (Kindler and Thiel, 2014). Resent study about PEDV indicated that the IFN-\u03b2 production was inhibited by blockage of the RIG-I-mediated pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (Cao et al., 2015). Despite the similarity in infection and pathological characteristics between PEDV and TGEV, several studies indicated TGEV infection could induce IFN-\u03b2 expression (Becares et al., 2016, Cruz et al., 2013a, Cruz et al., 2011, Marquez-Jurado et al., 2015). Our results also confirmed that TGEV infection induces type I interferon expression in the intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, the trend of viral gRNA expression was similar with IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression (Figs. 1 A and 2 A). The similar trend of gRNA expression and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA level was also observed in ST cells infected with TGEV (Cruz et al., 2013a). However, the abundant IFN-\u03b2 was produced too late to inhibit viral replication and infection of cells. This may also be the reason for the short latency and rapid development of transmissible gastroenteritis. Since the same structure of eukaryotic mRNAs, the nucleic acid of coronavirus could not be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (e.g. TLR7/8 or RIG-I/MDA5) (Zust et al., 2011). Moreover, Knoops and Kikkert et al. reported that ER-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) was the main sites for SARS-CoV replication. The viral dsRNA is mostly located in the inner lumen of DMVs (Snijder et al., 2006), whereas RIG-I/MDA5 cannot efficiently detect it. Not only that, coronavirus encodes several ribonucleases, such as nsp14 (Becares et al., 2016, Bouvet et al., 2012) and nsp 6 (Lundin et al., 2014) that could remove the RNA-PRRs complex and blockage of RLRs signaling. Due to these strategies, coronaviruses have been shown to induce limited expression of IFN-\u03b2. Furthermore, SARS-coronavirus ORF9b triggers the degradation of MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome and limits host cell IFN responses (Shi et al., 2014). In addition, nsp5, which encodes the 3C-like protease of PEDV, disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving NEMO (Wang et al., 2016). In agreement with current knowledge, TGEV is just less efficient than other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, antagonizing the host cell innate immune response. However, it is still confusing that the expression of IFN-\u03b2 was paralleled with the increase of viral RNA during the peak of viral nucleic acid replication. However, the invasion of TGEV could not induce efficient type I IFN expression in the early infection stage.",

            "text": "We found that in the early infection stage RIG-I (DDX58), the main PRRs identified dsRNA, appears to rise, which may be the reason for the synergistic effect in expression of IFN-\u03b2. We can observe several ISGs increase in the early infection stage (Fig. 3). It might be the reason that peroxisomal (RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) adaptor protein) MAVS induces the rapid interferon-independent expression of defense factors that provide short-term protection (Dixit et al., 2010). However, pre-treatment with poly(I:C) could decrease the expression of gRNA (Fig. 4A and B), inhibit the level of N protein after TGEV infection 12 h (Fig. 4C) and suppress the level of viral titer (Fig. 4E). It is surprising that the adequate IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs transcription could not suppress viral replication in the late infection stage (Fig. 4). We know very little about the interaction between TGEV infection and the host innate responses although it was reported that TGEV nsp14 and accessory gene 7 had the ability to modulate the innate immune response (Becares et al., 2016, Cruz et al., 2013a). Currently, we could only speculate about the cause of this effect. It appears that some structural or non-structural protein of TGEV were highly expressed in the late infection stage, which blocked type I IFN signal, resulting in loss of antiviral activity. Moreover, in the later phase of TGEV infection, massive IFN-\u03b2 expression of intestinal epithelial cells could not only fail to inhibit the viral transmission but also induce immunosuppressive molecules (McNab et al., 2015) or damage the host (Sadler and Williams, 2008, Chawla-Sarkar et al., 2003), which is not conducive to the host against virus infection.",

Our study characterizes that TGEV delayed IFN-\u03b2 expression in early infection but promoted IFN-\u03b2 expression in the peak of replication. Clearly, our understanding about the antagonistic effect to the IFN signal in late infection stage is still insufficient. Therefore, further work investigating the mechanisms of blockage of the type I IFN signal in intestinal epithelia cells during TGEV infection might be of importance to control viral infection.",
