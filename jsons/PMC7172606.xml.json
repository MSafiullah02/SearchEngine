            "text": "The syndrome of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring in non-intubated patients \u226548 h after hospitalization, and therefore not incubating at the time of admission.1 This is distinct from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is defined as pneumonia occurring after 48\u201372 h of mechanical ventilation in an intubated patient. HAP may be suspected if a patient develops new symptoms and signs consistent with respiratory tract infection (fever, abnormal chest examination, purulent sputum, tachypnoea, impaired oxygenation) and laboratory results consistent with inflammation (raised white cell count and C-reactive protein). However, the diagnosis of HAP also requires radiological demonstration of a new or progressive lung infiltrate.1 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) guidelines for the management of HAP highlight Gram-negative bacilli as frequently occurring pathogens in HAP and Staphylococcus aureus as an emerging cause. Much of the literature that has been used to describe the aetiology of HAP relates to VAP, nosocomial pneumonia occurring specifically in the intensive care unit (ICU) or nursing-home-acquired pneumonia.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Overall, more is known about the pathogenesis and microbiology of VAP, facilitated by the ease of obtaining deep respiratory samples by bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients. Importantly, there are evidence-based \u2018care bundles\u2019 to prevent VAP, but not HAP.7\n",

All patients treated with intravenous antimicrobials for \u226548 h for any indication were identified and reviewed by a consultant infectious disease physician and an antimicrobial pharmacist. To be included in the current study, a patient from this cohort had to be receiving intravenous antimicrobials for a documented clinical diagnosis of HAP, excluding VAP and CAP. Demographic data, medical history, admission details (including death during admission), clinical diagnosis (as deduced by the primary clinical team), microbiological sampling, and radiological investigations were collected.

The pathogenesis of HAP may therefore often be related to microaspiration of oropharyngeal contents around the cuff of an endotracheal (ET) tube in paralysed intubated patients during surgery, without necessarily a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation such as during critical illness (i.e. VAP). In a systematic literature review of airway management strategies to reduce the incidence of VAP in critically ill ventilated patients in the ICU, interventions including continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions using a special ET tube (vs standard ET tubes) and the use of heat and moisture exchangers have been shown to lower VAP rates.8 In a separate study, persistent ET tube cuff pressure of <20 cmH2O was also associated with risk of VAP.9 Such interventions could also be evaluated in intubated patients undergoing surgery. Similarly, in critically ill ventilated patients, oral hygiene with chlorhexidine mouthwash has been shown to reduce rates of VAP, and has been included as a component of a successfully evaluated \u2018VAP care bundle\u2019.7, 10 Chlorhexidine mouthwash would be an inexpensive measure for use in the immediate pre- and postoperative period for surgical patients. Oral care (chlorhexidine mouthwash or mechanical cleaning) was shown to be associated with a reduced relative risk of pneumonia in a meta-analysis incorporating non-ventilated hospital inpatients and nursing home residents (though there was a high risk of bias in included studies).11 Other postoperative factors likely to be important in development of HAP include being bed-bound, having reduced chest wall movement (and therefore reduced clearance of secretions) due to pain or being drowsy secondary to opiate analgesics.",

A phenotype has been described in ventilated ICU patients with respiratory signs but no infiltrate on chest imaging, labelled nosocomial tracheobronchitis.12 This has been associated with longer ICU admission and ventilation times but prospective data describing the necessity for antimicrobials are lacking.12 Further study of this phenotype in non-intubated patients may be valuable and it may account for some of the cases in this study without radiological changes consistent with HAP. Non-infective alternatives include atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, and underlying lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (present in 27.1% of patients treated for HAP in this study) and asthma. Unwell patients labelled as \u2018HAP\u2019 may have a subdiaphragmatic cause of sepsis resulting in the clinical findings. Given the demonstrated difficulty in reaching a reliable clinical diagnosis of HAP, microbiological testing to confirm an infective aetiology becomes even more important, but a sputum sample was obtained from only 24.7% of patients treated for HAP. This low rate may reflect the difficulty in obtaining a suitable deep specimen from non-intubated patients with a degree of respiratory distress or weakness. In such patients biomarkers of pulmonary infection would be helpful in establishing the likelihood of an infective aetiology and justifying the use of empirical antimicrobials prior to culture results.",

In the remainder of cases where a sputum sample was obtained, the result was \u2018no growth\u2019, \u2018respiratory commensals\u2019 or \u2018yeasts\u2019. Antimicrobial resistance was significant, with most Gram-negative isolates displaying resistance to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, but susceptibility to piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. However, the overall number of sputum cultures obtained from patients was low, reducing the utility of these data in describing the microbiology of HAP. In addition, we recognize the potential for contamination of sputum samples with oropharyngeal colonizers. This is an important issue, especially considering the prescription of broad-spectrum antimicrobials to cover the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens, but pragmatically one would aim to cover these species if they were identified in a sputum sample from a patient with HAP. As discussed above, the inability to routinely obtain deep respiratory tract specimens (e.g. BAL) from non-intubated patients hinders microbiological diagnosis in HAP. The largest report on the microbiology of HAP comes from a retrospective cohort study of a US inpatient database of patients with culture-positive pneumonia, including 835 patients with HAP.14 Here, S. aureus accounted for 47.1% of cases, Pseudomonas spp. 18.4%, Klebsiella spp. 7.1%, Haemophilus spp. 5.6%, E. coli 4.7%, Enterobacter spp. 4.3%, and Acinetobacter spp. 2.0%. Overall, Gram-negative pathogens were isolated from 45.8% of HAP cases. A complicating factor in conventional culture-based testing of samples from patients with suspected HAP is the fact they will most likely already have received antimicrobials prior to sampling, impairing sensitivity of pathogen detection using culture-based techniques. A qPCR test for detection and quantification of eight key bacterial causes of pneumonia (including S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa) from sputum samples has recently been described and could represent a useful tool for the investigation of suspected HAP.15\n",

In cases where HAP is suspected clinically but the chest X-ray does not show a new/progressive lung infiltrate, there may be a role for CT scanning. In addition, there is emerging evidence for the role of lung ultrasound for the detection of pulmonary infiltrates in CAP, with some data suggesting superiority over chest X-ray when compared to CT as a gold standard.21, 22 A further limitation lies in the case\u2013control analysis performed, which should be repeated in the future with a control cohort of hospital inpatients with no clinical suspicion of HAP.
