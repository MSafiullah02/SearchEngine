Interestingly, the presence of diarrhea or vomit were associated with a better prognosis, independently of patient age and sex. It is worth noting that we excluded patients admitted in critical conditions in whom a detailed medical history about gastrointestinal symptoms was not adequately assessed. Our findings could be explained by a prevalent GI viral localization rather than respiratory. Gastrointestinal tropism of SARS-CoV2 has been demonstrated in a recent study that detected SARS-CoV2 more frequently in the stools of patients presenting with diarrhea. 4, 5 We also found that elevated lipase and alkaline phosphatase levels were associated with poor prognosis; whether this reflects a greater systemic inflammatory response or an early sign of multiorgan failure needs to be ascertained. 6 Since ACE2 receptors are highly expressed by pancreatic islets, a possible direct cytopathic injury seems likely. 6 The action of Sars-CoV on the pancreas through these receptors can induce acute hyperglycemia and transient type-2-diabetes, 7 possibly leading to further complications and poor prognosis. The correlation we observed with alkaline phosphatase is intriguing as ACE2 receptors are also abundantly expressed on endothelial liver cells, which makes liver a potential target for SARS-CoV. 8 However, liver biopsies of Covid-19 patients have not shown signs of biliary tract damage or cholestasis, thus we cannot exclude that high alkaline phosphatase reflects bone diseases and systemic frailty.",
