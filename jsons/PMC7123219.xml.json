No one knows exactly where it came from, but it is postulated that a mutation in an animal virus allowed it to jump species and infect humans. In 1976 simultaneous outbreaks of Ebola occurred in what is now South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For 20 years, only sporadic cases were seen, but in 1995 a new outbreak occurred killing hundreds in the DRC. Since that time the frequency of these outbreaks has been increasing. It is uncertain why this is occurring, but many associate it with increasing human encroachment into forested areas bringing people and animals into more intimate contact and increased mobility of previously remote population. This chapter will navigate Ebola in the context of global health and security.",

Yes, they practiced Christianity, but also followed the traditions of their ancestors. Women in her village prayed to Jesus and God, but also to their ancestors. Outsiders sometimes questioned how the Kissi could follow both Christianity and their old traditions, but Sia had never seen a problem. Ancestors after all, were the ones who communicated with God. When someone in the family died, they were escorted to the realm of the ancestors where they were able to protect the living family and speak to God on their behalf. Ancestors continued to live in the village, but in their new form. Sia shivered thinking of what happened to those who died and were not escorted to the realm of the ancestors. Ceremonies were usually performed by the brother of the deceased. If the ceremonies were not done properly, a loved one would become a wandering ghost instead of an ancestor. Wandering ghosts torment the living bringing misfortune to everyone in the village, especially to the family that failed to perform the proper rights. Sia did not like to think of such things, but there had been several deaths in a nearby village and she could not help but to wonder if it was the work of a wandering ghost.",

Reston is highly pathogenic for non-human primates and pigs, and Bombali has been discovered in free-tailed bats as part of ongoing research to discover the Ebola reservoir. The Zaire species was responsible for the first Ebola virus outbreak in 1976 and is considered to be the deadliest of the six [63]. Initially the disease caused by Ebola virus was called Ebola hemorrhagic fever, but later studies showed that the hemorrhagic manifestations were less common than initially thought and subsequently the name was changed to Ebola Virus Disease (EBD).",

It has also been shown that, at least in primates, Ebola can be spread through intramuscular injection, and inoculation can occur through contact of the conjunctiva or oral mucosa with infected body fluids [61]. Blood, vomitus, and feces are the body fluid most likely to spread infection because of the frequency with which they are encountered during the course of the illness, but other fluid such as urine, semen, vaginal fluid, tears, sweat, and breast milk also have potential for viral transmission [2, 5, 70, 88, 97, 112].",

The presentation of Ebola is non-specific so early on in the disease process it may be diagnosed as malaria, influenza, or other non-specific viral illness. If a patient is initially misdiagnosed, then proper protective measures to limit the spread of Ebola will not be initiated.

Next the medicine man shows his spiritual power by having a large rock placed on his abdomen and broken by an ax while he remains still. Once his strength has been established, his attention can be turned to his patient. The medicine man\u2019s diagnosis is mental illness caused by evil ancestors who have returned with the purpose of tormenting the patient. Incantations are the treatment [106]. Beliefs and practices such as this are common in rural Central Africa. In these societies, illness is viewed as a disruption in the relationship between God, ancestors, and the person affected. Witchcraft, sorcery, angry ancestors, and evil spirits may all be at the root of disease and a powerful medicine man can restore the proper balance in these relationships thus curing disease [84, 91].

The disease is highly fatal, but even more insipid, it exploits traditional ceremonies and death-rights as a means of spread. Poverty, both at personal and national level has resulted in an infrastructure ill-equipped to deal with events such as Ebola. Overcrowding promotes transmission and lack of financial incentives have delayed vaccine development. Despite the barriers, EVD is slowing being more well understood, thousands of research articles have been published, and guidelines for every aspect of the disease have been published by the WHO, CDC, or other government level organizations.
