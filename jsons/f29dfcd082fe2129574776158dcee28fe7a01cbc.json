            "text": "To determine if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country with no shared border with China. Methods Summary: Determining how many imported cases are needed to trigger an outbreak in a new location is critical to quantifying if SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can be delayed. Here we rely on the \"outbreak threshold\", which is a function of the average number of secondary cases produced by each infected case, plus the variation from person-to-person in how many secondary cases they generate (often referred to as \"the dispersion parameter, k\"). We define a traveller intervention as either: a) screening for symptoms at either departure or arrival, b) sensitisation of arrivals to signs of illness, or c) a combination of both. We assume that sensitisation will result in a lower individual reproduction number for the traveller (e.g. by self-isolation and more rapid reporting which triggers contact tracing) and that syndromic screening reduces the number of infected travellers who can seed an outbreak. We then calculate the delay in reaching the outbreak threshold according to the number of infected travellers arriving each week, and the effectiveness of interventions a, b, and c, assuming the basic reproduction number to be gamma distributed with CIs ranging from 1.4 to 3.9. Because of the considerable uncertainty in the estimate we report no central estimates but rather 50% and 95% quantiles, focusing specifically on the lower bounds as a measure of likely minimal impact. Results Summary: We evaluated sensitisation effectiveness of 30, 50 and 70%, assuming either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. We found that early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. For 50% effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 7 days). The possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher R 0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. However, syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance impact. In combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. In 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 111 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 23 days) for 1 infected .

If the number of secondary infections is substantially less disperse, e.g. influenza-like, outbreak delays decrease by about 50%, as the outbreak becomes less reliant on occasional superspreading events ( Figure S1 ).

Similarly, sensitisation of travellers from high risk countries to encourage self isolation and enable rapid case detection and contact tracing if indeed infected will likely not be able to halt an outbreak indefinitely, particularly when many infected travellers arrive undetected. We investigate here how syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation as well as their combination may delay an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. We find that while there is only about 1 infected traveller per week, either syndromic airport screening or traveller sensitisation has the potential to slightly delay an outbreak (about 75% probability to delay more than 2 weeks). The incremental effect of syndromic entry screening, however, is only notable if exit screening is poor. As soon as 10 infected passengers per week arrive the delay reduces substantially, although if both interventions are used in combination a 75% probability for at least about a one and a half week delay remains. Our results, however, are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 , less effect of traveller sensitisation on R 0 and increasing numbers of infected travellers the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible, on the order of a few days.",

Syndromic screening can also aid to reduce the number of passengers that would eventually self-report and then require resource intensive follow up, including contact tracing. Therefore, syndromic screening may help to sustain control efforts for longer. Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or largely ineffective.",

With increasing numbers of infected travellers, a higher number of secondary infections or a lower heterogeneity thereof, or less effective interventions, the achievable delay quickly drops down to a few days of delay. While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions. E.g. we have assumed recently reported heterogeneity in the individual R 0 , however the reported range of uncertainty includes SARS-like and influenza-like which can drastically alter the results. Some recent, yet not peer reviewed estimates would suggest more SARS like or even more overdispersed k which would imply that longer outbreak delays are possible (15) . Further, we have assumed constant importation rates for infected cases. While the proportion of infected travellers may increase exponentially during the early phase of an outbreak, closure of airports in highly affected regions during the outbreak so far may have helped to keep the number of infected travellers at a level where control is still possible. We also don't explicitly account for potential asymptomatic transmission. However, we implicitly do so as both the syndromic screening as well as the contact tracing work that infomed our estimates accounted for a small proportion of asymptomatic transmitters.
