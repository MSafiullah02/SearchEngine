In bacteriology, upper airway sampling can misrepresent the lower airway microbiota [1], [2]. In contrast, there is little such comparative data for virology. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) or nasal washes are regarded as the specimen of choice for detection of upper respiratory tract viruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3], [4]. Upper airway sampling is relatively simple, can be performed at the bedside and is minimally invasive. In contrast, lower airway sampling in young children is invasive, requiring a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).",

However, as BAL requires specialist input and is often performed under anesthesia, it is reserved for patients with complex or severe disease, e.g., in the setting of intensive care; immune-compromise or in children with chronic or recurrent respiratory tract symptoms. The disparities in ease of collection of NPA versus BAL, raise two important questions. Firstly, what is the comparative yield of NPA compared to BAL for respiratory virus detection in children? Secondly, what is the significance of a positive NPA with respect to lower airway inflammation? Given the lack of studies addressing these important questions [5], [6], we evaluated paired NPA and BAL specimens in 75 children.",

A higher yield of hMPV was seen in NPA compared to BAL, with comparable rates of IFAV, HPIV, RSV, HCoV and HRV [6]. Diagnostic accuracy of NPA for BAL was not assessed in this study [6]. The second study used paired specimens, obtained from 21 participants on 92 occasions, and compared induced sputum to NPA for detection of respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis. HRV was the most common virus identified and was present in the same frequency (21.7%) in NPA and sputum. Concordance rates were higher than in the present study (87% for HRV and 92% for other viruses), with higher sensitivity and specificity (70% and 91.7%, respectively) [15].

The first study evaluated Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and the second compared detection methods for mycoplasma pneumonia. Both studies found high concordance between NPA and BAL. However, in contrast to our findings, in both studies, BAL had a higher yield of positive detections than NPA. Interestingly, in the study on mycoplasma pneumonia, BAL positivity was associated with increased lower airway %neutrophils, however, NPA positivity was not. These differing findings may reflect the different modes of transmission and mechanisms of disease progression between viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.",

In contrast, HAdV was more likely to also be found in the lower airway, with only 2 NPA-positive/BAL-negative children. Previous studies have found HRV to have greater propensity to infect the nasopharynx and proximal lower airways than the distal airways or alveoli [16]. This may be related to HRV's ability to replicate optimally at cooler temperatures of the upper airway [17], although this finding is inconsistent across HRV types [18]. In vivo studies demonstrate that HRV induces minimal epithelial cytotoxicity with only a small subset of nasal and bronchial mucosal cells becoming infected [16], [19], [20]. These factors may explain why HRV is an uncommon cause of pneumonia, except in the immune-compromised host [21]. Whilst HRV and HAdV can both cause uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection [22], disease manifestation differs at the severe end of the spectrum. HRV has been shown to play an important role in asthma exacerbations [23]; HAdV has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obliterative bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis [24]. Thus, differences between HAdV and HRV in their mechanisms of propagation and respiratory disease pathogenesis are likely to explain our observations.",

A PCR-positive NPA in a child without overt symptoms of acute RVI is often believed to represent viral genome shedding from a resolving infection [29] or preceding a new symptomatic episode. However, certain HAdV types can cause prolonged host shedding [30] with intermittent viral excretion over months to years [31], [32]. In contrast, HRVs usually do not persist. Garnett et al. postulate that \u201csmoldering HAdV at the site of lung inflammation\u201d may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults [33]. Our finding of low BAL %lymphocytes, together with neutrophilia, in children who were HAdV DNA positive on BAL, supports the notion that active lower airway HAdV replication was likely to be occurring (as opposed to latent HAdV infection of lymphocytes). Whether such persistence of HAdV viral DNA within the respiratory tract of children is benign or contributes to the development of chronic lung disease/s is unknown.",

However, there are a number of limitations. Firstly, this study involved children with chronic respiratory symptoms, predominantly cough. Hence, these findings may not be readily extrapolated to healthy children or to those with acute lower respiratory tract illness. This is particularly pertinent to influenza and RSV, as there were very few children in whom these viruses were detected. Secondly, we used neutrophilic lower airway inflammation as a surrogate marker for active pulmonary disease, as used by other authors [34], [35]. We did not, however, test for additional indirect markers of viral infection such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10) or virus-specific antibodies. Thirdly, we only obtained BAL samples at a single time-point, precluding the ability to make inferences regarding causality. Lastly, although we were fastidious in our BAL technique, contamination of the bronchoscope in its route through the upper airway is possible. The significant number of BAL positive/NPA negative cases, however, negates the argument that contamination could account for all lower airway detections.",
