In the ensuing weeks, American jurisdictions attempted to manage disease spread on a regional basis using non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. social distancing), as uneven disease burden across the expansive geography of the United States exerted different implications for policy management in different regions. While Arizona policymakers relied initially on stateby-state national modeling projections from different groups outside of the state, we sought to create a state-specific model using a mathematical framework that ties disease surveillance with the future burden on Arizona's healthcare system. Our framework uses a compartmental system dynamics model using an SEIRD framework that accounts for multiple types of disease manifestations for the COVID-19 infection, as well as the observed time delay in epidemiological findings following public policy enactments. We use a bin initialization logic coupled with a fitting technique to construct projections for key metrics to guide public health policy.",

However, Arizona is still experiencing wide community spread of SARS-CoV-2. Due to a relatively low rate of testing statewide, there is ongoing debate and uncertainty about whether Arizona's case prevalence data provides an accurate portrait of the true public health risk burden and whether we have passed an (initial) peak of infections and hospitalizations statewide and in individual counties. Current projections from a variety of modeling groups (i.e., IHME, UA, ASU) indicate that the peak number of cases will be reached in Arizona in mid-April -mid-May. However, it is important to note that modeling projections are inherently uncertain, and accurate assessment of case peaks will be possible only once the peak has passed. In light of the transmission dynamics and laboratory reporting delays for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, peak determination will be possible approximately two to four weeks following peak occurrence. It is also important to note that there is still significant uncertainty about the transmission dynamics of the virus, including the degree of asymptomatic infection and transmission and the results do not capture the full range of uncertaintly. We demonstrate this observation through our modeling below.",

Arizona has not yet developed a comprehensive plan that incorporates the full testing capabilities within the state (both molecular and serological) with a program linked to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) including stay-at-home and other social distancing and infection mitigation policies and procedures.

This model structure allows us to estimate the number of patients in the hospital and assess model fit with respect to two sources of data: daily new cases and cumulative reported deaths over time. In essence, the population of interest, in this case, the population of the State of Arizona (assumed to be 7,278,717 in this study) is divided into states of Susceptible (S), Exposed but not yet infectious (E), Asymptomatic infected (I a ), infectious and presymptomatic (I p ), Symptomatic with a mild infection (I s ), symptomatic with a severe infection and hospitalized (H), symptomatic with a critical infection and in the ICU (C), undergoing additional recovery in ICU (B), Recovered and immune (R) and Dead (D), as shown in Figure 2 . Our model defines separate bins for asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals to explicitly account for transmissions by infected individuals who do not exhibit symptoms. Several results in the literature point to the fact that the viral shedding by these individuals are also different. In comparison, individuals who are exposed to the virus generally go through an incubation period (modeled by a rate of \u03b6) during which they are exposed but not yet infectious. This duration is modeled as 3 days in our study, to support an ensemble estimate of 5 days for time from exposure to symptoms and an estimate of 6 days serial time obtained from the literature [22, 9, 12, 1, 13, 5] . After the preinfectious period, individuals become infectious, either as an asymptomatic or a presymptomatic patient. The presymptomatic duration (modeled with rate \u03b4) is assumed to be 2 days [19, 23] . Asymptomatic patients recover at a rate of \u03b3 = 1/6, corresponding to an average 3 .

The clinicians we have been partnering with in Phoenix metropolitan area and Tucson hospitals have indicated that an average of 20% of these patients, however, progress to a critical infection, requiring ICU care and possibly intubation. In addition to patients that progress to the ICU from a regular hospital bed, our partnering clinicians informed us of a small fraction of patients that report to the hospital with a critical infection with breathing problems and are directly admitted to the ICU. Hence, in our model, there are two modes of admission to the ICU; one directly from the emergency room and the other one from a regular ward, after the patient's infection progresses to a critical condition. The parameters for these splits are set to ensure that (i) fraction of symptomatic patients with mild infection is 81% [21, 24] , (ii) the total fraction of symptomatic patients that develop a critical infection that requires ICU care is 5% [21] and (ii) 20% of patients in a regular bed progress to a critical infection [15] .",

For example, [18] cites point estimates for the duration of onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days. This additional time is also due to various steps that caregivers have to take to arrange for care after the ICU period since generally patients that underwent intubation and other invasive procedures require subsequent care in other postacute facilities. This additional \"recovery\" time is represented as another bin, with a duration of 4 days (modeled with rate \u03b1). The reported average ICU stays in the literature are generally very diverse; we adopted a conservative point estimate of 8 days to align with the symptom onset to recovery/death estimates [18] as well as other more detailed studies that tracked patients' progress through the hospital [24].",

Several studies point to the importance of modeling transmissions by asymptomatic individuals, who may never be aware that they were transmitting the virus during a period of infectiousness. However, point estimates on the fraction of individuals that experience asymptomatic infection vary greatly from context to context. In our models we adopted a relatively high asymptomatic rate of 40% based on point estimates observed by (author?) [16] because this assumption allows us to obtain worst-case estimates on the prevalence of infections in the general population given that in the absence of widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals, the asymptomatic patients are generally undetected. In our modeling and analysis, we explicitly consider the possibility that only a small fraction of the true incidence of infections are detected as COVID-19 cases and reflected in the reported case counts and deaths. One such example that points to a large undetected fraction of cases is [10] , indicating that 86% of the early infections in China were undocumented, implying that the \"actual\" cases in a population may be more than 7 times the detected cases. The same study also offers a rate of transmissions by asymptomatic individuals at 55% of the transmission rate by symptomatic individuals, which we reflect in the force of infection, \u03bb(t) shown in Figure 2 . Subsequently several other papers have offered additional understanding on the role of asymptomatic infections in transmission and its prevalence in different contexts [14, 8, 16, 7, 2] . We use these papers along with the actual data on new cases and deaths in Arizona to obtain point 4 .

Studies that point to the high-infectiousness of presymptomatic patients [3] implies that infections are mostly driven by patients in these compartments. We model a time dependent transmission rate, \u03b2 t , denoted by the subscript t to represent the time dependency. Together with the force of infection and the current pool of susceptible individuals, the transmission rate \u03b2 t yields the rate at which susceptible individuals get exposed to the infection. The force of infection term can be thought of as the probability that an arbitrary individual is infectious at a rate equivalent to that of a symptomatic patient. The transmission rate, \u03b2 t represents the average rate of contact between susceptible and (symptomaticequivalent) infectious people multiplied by the probability of transmission given contact. Hence, given the above force of infection and the number of individuals in the susceptible compartment, the rate at which individuals become exposed to the virus at time t is strongly driven by the term, \u03b2 t . A good way of thinking about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, stay-at-home orders, school closures, wearing masks, etc. is through the term \u03b2 t , and how the different interventions impact either (i) the average number of infectious individuals that susceptible individuals contact, or (ii) the probability of transmission given contact.",

Staying on the same \u03b2 curve of 0.20 while increasing the average number of contacts for a susceptible individual from 10 to, say, 20 requires that the probability of transmission given contact be reduced from 0.02 to 0.013 through measures that reduce the probability of transmission given contact with an infectious individual.

Given that our model indicates an incubation period of 5 days and average time to seek testing (when it is available) is about 3 days after symptom-onset, we obtain \"presumed\" exposure dates for the reported new cases on each day. A visual that shows this logic is shown with the blue bars (reported new cases over time) and the orange bars (numbers eventually detected, shown on the presumed exposure dates) in Figure 4 .

We tried a number of different initialization dates, but the results on the \u03b2 fit were comparable, and furthermore, since the stay-at-home order was issued in Arizona on March 31, we expect that the transmission rate starting from 3/31 to stay relatively consistent during the period 3/31 to 4/15 with respect to the exposures that happened during this time period. This is why we selected to initialize on this date. We use a least-squares method to identify the best value of \u03b2 to describe the transmission rate under the stay-at-home order in Arizona. As an example, Figure 6a shows the model fit along with the 95% prediction intervals for the number of exposures under a 4X scenario. The grey points in the graph show the raw values (without the 4X correction) of the presumed exposures (or, 1X scenario). In addition to fitting the transmission rate, \u03b2, we use the cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths in Arizona to fit the mortality rate among the ICU patients. Note that in our model, we assume that all patients who die will do so in the ICU, which ignores the deaths that occur outside the hospital. At the time of the writing of this manuscript, Arizona's healthcare capacity, beds, ICU have been sufficient to care for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, to our knowledge, Arizona has not experienced significant reported deaths outside the hospitals due to an inability for patients to access critical care services.

We first start with the benchmark cases of 1X, 4X and 6X loading scenarios simulated under the assumption of constant transmission rates obtained by fitting the model to data during the stay-at-home period. While the transmission rate that is indicated by the model fitting exercise outlined above is relatively low, indicating a R effective value of approximately 1, it is useful to observe the dynamics in a relatively long horizon of 500 days, as given in Figure 7 . Day 0 in this simulation is 3/31, where we initialize our model and run it with the beta and \u03c5 values that we fitted using the new remaining data on new cases and deaths after this point (i.e., 16 points of backcasted presumed exposures and 30 days of data on deaths). Given the large initial susceptible population that we use for the model (i.e., 7,278,717) it takes around 200 days to reach herd immunity as long as the transmission rate is maintained at this current constant level. The number of hospitalizations reaches 26,650 on day 175, which corresponds to mid-September 2020. This figure demonstrates that policies that were initially put in place to limit contacts have been effective in reducing transmission, but also preserve a high pool of susceptibles that can be returned into mixing with the general public and can ignite future outbreaks.",

While we are not certain about a potential summer effect, particularly on virus survivability, we have found it to be a useful context to demonstrate the sensitivity of outbreak dynamics to the transmission rate \u03b2. In Figure 9 , we plotted the total infected and the hospitalizations under four different scenarios with respect to the summer effect. The plot shows the tradeoff between an early summer effect versus a later but more significant summer effect. The figure also demonstrates the impact of a 25% to 50% reduction in the transmission rate as well as the impact of the timing of the summer effect in flattening the curve further.",

Hence, these scenarios are presented as relatively moderate levels of increase; the increase in transmission rate \u03b2 can certainly be much higher. Figure 10 shows the hospitalizations over a period of about five months for three different ways that this increase may happen: an \"early\" 30% increase on 5/15 upon the lifting of the current stay-at-home orders in place on 5/1, a \"late\" 30% increase on 6/15 and a gradual 10% increase on 5/15, 6/1 and 6/15, as well as keeping the transmission rate the same at \u03b2 = 0.2226 for the 4X loading scenario.

The more realistic scenario is that we will be tracking the behavior of the epidemic and will be triggering NPI actions to manage the impact on healthcare resources and public health. Hence, it is useful to view the short-term behavior of the curve to gain some insight into the signals that one can look for in the data as we relax the stay-at-home orders. Figure 11 plots the presumed exposures inferred from data (for 4X loading) as well as the reported COVID-19 deaths in Arizona (the blue curve in these plots is the same as the orange curves in Figure 8 ). The figure clearly shows that we will be observing an increase in transmission rate, but unfortunately with a significant time lag. The increase in presumed exposures starting from 5/15 shown in Figure 11a will be observed in the case counts data starting from 6/1. This fact is also clearly shown in Figure 11b ; we expect to start seeing increases in death counts starting from the beginning of June. If the transmission rate increases more gradually, then it will be even harder to conclusively say that the transmission rate has increased.

Note that both plots start from the date of 5/15, which is the date for which Arizona is going to be lifting the stay-at-home orders, as of 5/1. We can observe from the plots that the excess new cases and deaths start getting reported about 2 weeks after the first 10% increase in \u03b2. We assumed that the assumption on detecting 1/4 of the actual cases (i.e., 4X scenario) and plotted the excess that you would expect to be detected in this scenario in Figure 13a . Note that these are expected increases in the case counts and deaths assuming a homogeneous increase in the transmission rate across the entire susceptible population in the State. Hence, typically the numbers we expect to pick up from the data will be smaller. This also points to the importance of rigorous testing and monitoring of new cases since this framework, supported with good quality data, can yield an ability to develop reactive shut-down strategies like the one depicted in Figure 12 . Figure 13 omits the prediction intervals to keep the demonstration of excess new cases and deaths simple but the prediction intervals on the number of new cases and deaths, allows us to construct \"control limits\" that would signal an \"out-of-control\" situation with respect to the transmission rate, \u03b2. Our current work involves development of these trigger control limits under explicit consideration of the various sources of model uncertainty.
