Initial cases were detected in Wuhan, a city in China, near the end of 2019 [1]. The virus is believed to replicate in the respiratory system during the prodromal period, and exhibits human-to-human transmission patterns through respiratory droplets and contact routes [1,2]. The disease causes mild to severe illness, with symptoms appearing 2-14 days after exposure and most commonly comprising fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Most severe illness occurs in older adults but comparison with the pediatric population can be challenging as documented cases in infants and children have been scarce [3,4].",
