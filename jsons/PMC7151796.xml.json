Our understanding of the dynamics of host\u2013virus interaction has been greatly augmented by the ability to culture animal cells outside the organism,59\n,\n269 and the ability to infect such cultured cells with viruses, first demonstrated with poliovirus.326 The outcome of a virus infection is predicated upon the nature of these defense mechanisms and the ability of the infecting virus to block or evade such antiviral mechanisms. Depending on these factors, predicted outcomes of a virus infection can be the death of the cell or organism due to unrestricted viral replication; effective inhibition of virus replication resulting in the survival of the cell or organism; or the establishment of a persistent or latent infection with a limited amount of viral replication or viral gene expression, until some event disturbs the balance in favor of the virus.",

The total number of illnesses caused by these viruses has been estimated to be upwards of 30 million cases per year in the United States. However, most estimates indicate foods as a primary source of infection in only 5\u20136% of the incidences.75\n,\n186\n,\n221 For reasons to be discussed in Section 15.6, direct demonstration of the presence of viruses in foods implicated in foodborne outbreaks have been achieved only in a few instances.125\n,\n182\n,\n195 In terms of sheer numbers, Norwalk virus (NV) within the genus norovirus (NoV) is responsible for the vast majority of foodborne illnesses in the United States, followed by astro- and rotaviruses.221 Hepatitis A virus comes in at a distant fourth, and the numbers have dropped somewhat following the development of an effective vaccine.12 However, like many enteric viruses, the number of asymptomatic infections is high, and the reported cases may not reflect the actual number of infections. Asymptomatic individuals excrete the virus in the feces and are capable of spreading the virus via person-to-person contact, as well as through contaminated foods.186 Poliovirus (PV) infections have been eradicated in most industrialized countries but remain endemic in some developing countries.66 Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), however, may be of concern to non-immunized populations.43\n,\n180 Hepatitis E virus (HEV), was once thought to be mainly a waterborne disease in the third world; however, many industrialized countries including the United States, Japan, and countries in the European Union have recently reported sporadic HEV infections from farm and game animals.100 Particularly intriguing are reports from Japan that people who consumed undercooked meat from wild boars and deer have contracted the disease.300\n",

Vertical demarcations within the boxed regions indicate the amino- and carboxy-terminal boundaries of fully processed viral proteins. The relative locations of the proline-rich hinge region (H), X and Y domains (X and Y in parentheses) encoded by HEV ORF1 are also indicated. The significance of stippled versus solid demarcations is discussed further below. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) are shown as solid lines and the relative differences in nucleotide length of the UTRs among the various genomes is schematically illustrated by the differences in length of the line. Beneath each genome, horizontal lines define the genomic and subgenomic RNAs and delineate the respectively encoded open reading frames (ORFs), in order to highlight the differences that exist among the virus groups regarding the number, size, and genomic location of the viral genome/transcripts utilized by these viruses to produce their respective viral proteins. Panel I\u2013III viruses have polyadenylated genomes. Their genome is the primary viral transcript used for initial viral protein translation upon host cell infection. Group I viruses encode a single polyprotein identified by one ORF, whereby capsid (i.e. structural) proteins are derived from the P1 region and nonstructural proteins (e.g. protease, RNA polymerase) are derived from the P2 and P3 regions. Group II and III viruses produced nonstructural proteins (ORF1) from their primary transcript and also produce subgenomic RNAs during infection for translation of their structural proteins, and putative accessory phosphoprotein for HEV (ORFs 2 and 3). ORF1 is differentiated from ORFs 2 and 3 by solid versus stippled vertical lines, respectively, within the open boxes. Viruses in group I and II are not capped but rather have a covalently attached VPg (viral protein g) moiety at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. For PV, this moiety is removed (*) by a cellular enzyme following infection. Viruses in group III and IV have a 7 mG cap moiety at the 5\u2032 end of their genomes. Unlike the single-stranded, positive polarity of the viruses in groups I\u2013III, the rotaviruses (group IV) genomes are double-stranded and segmented. Rotaviruses contain 11 dsRNA segments which encode 12 proteins, whereby the 11th segment encodes two proteins. Shown as a representative segment in this figure, segment 1 encodes for the viral RNA polymerase. Each rotavirus genome segment is transcribed (from the negative strand) into an RNA transcript which is 7 mG capped prior to the translation of its ORF. It is important to note that actual nucleotide lengths and distances are not drawn to scale.",

The 5\u2032 UTR of picornaviruses is larger than the 5\u2032 UTR in caliciviruses, and houses the internal ribosomal entry segment or IRES (Fig. 15.2\n). As depicted and discussed in Fig. 15.2, viral RNA translation occurs in a cap-independent manner as opposed to the translation of host cellular mRNAs.54\n,\n78\n,\n184\n,\n194\n,\n253\n,\n311 The major difference is that picornaviral genomes are translated as a single polyprotein (Fig. 15.1), which are then cleaved by viral coded proteases 2A and 3C (only 3C in the case of HAV) to produce mature viral proteins. Calicivirus genomes, on the other hand, are organized into three different ORFs, and are translated into three different proteins, with the lone viral protease 3C performing all maturation cleavages (Fig. 15.1). Recent studies indicate that the 5\u2032 terminal IRES also plays a significant role in pathogenesis of picornaviruses (see Section 15.2.5). For a full discussion of the various aspects of viral RNA synthesis, protein translation, and processing, the reader is referred to several recent reviews.131\n,\n135\n,\n150\n,\n216\n,\n291 Unlike picorna- and calicivirus genomes, a 7-methyl guanosine cap structure284 is present in the genomes of HEV,172\n,\n208\n,\n251 and rotaviruses.116 The double-stranded RNA genome of rotavirus is not active as mRNA.104\n,\n116\n,\n164\n,\n240 Instead, the minus strand of each segment of the genome is first transcribed to yield the plus (coding) strand and then capped by virus coded capping enzymes, which is then translated to produce viral proteins. Unlike other foodborne viruses, neither the genomic nor the newly synthesized rotaviral RNAs are polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end.229\n",

The rotavirus capsid also contains the viral RNA polymerase and capping enzymes.229 The purpose of the protein shell or capsid is to protect the nucleic acid genome from damage by physical and chemical agents. Foodborne viruses lack a lipid envelope/membrane that is a feature of many of the larger DNA and RNA viruses which may explain their resistance to bile salts in vivo and detergents and organic solvents in vitro.135\n,\n266 However, the enveloped avian influenza virus is stable at the low pH of the gut in birds and is excreted in bird feces at very high concentrations.301 Thus, the absence of an envelope is not the only determinant of resistance to bile. The proteins of the capsid bind to specific receptors on cell surfaces in order to gain viral entry into the cell, and are important determinants of the host range and pathogenicity of the virus (see Section 15.3.1). The primary and higher-order structures of the capsid proteins also play critical roles in determining heat and acid stability, as well as resistance to stomach and intestinal proteases. Recent studies230\n,\n231 showed that even digestion with proteinase K failed to expose the HAV genome to RNase activity as measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) unless the virions were also treated with heat or other chemical agents. The stability of enteric viruses to physical and chemical agents has been the subject of much experimentation and controversy owing to the lack of a standardized set of conditions to be followed for such studies.83\n,\n84\n,\n159\n,\n207\n,\n220\n,\n236\n,\n273 Constituents of food matrices (such as sucrose in strawberry mash) also affect the heat stability of HAV.35\n,\n87 NoV has not been grown in cell culture; thus the heat and acid stability is inferred from either experiments with a surrogate virus, such as the feline calicivirus,97\n,\n230\n,\n288 or by the resistance of the viral genome to various treatments as detected by RT-PCR.207\n,\n231 However, feline calicivirus infects via the respiratory route, and therefore cannot be considered truly representative of enteric human caliciviruses. The RT-PCR approach (Fig. 15.3\n) suffers from the small target size of the amplicon, which may not detect damage to the genome over its entire length.34 The RT-PCR approach also suffers from the disadvantage that inactivated virus often produce positive RT-PCR signal, particularly when a small region of the viral genome is targeted for amplification.34\n,\n230\n,\n231 The apparent lack of correlation between infectivity and nucleic acid detection by molecular methods is of great concern to food virologists and regulatory agencies concerned with food safety (see Section 15.6).",

Type I IRESs are present in enteroviruses and human rhinovirus while Type II IRESs are present in other picornaviruses such as cardioviruses and aphthoviruses. A possible third Type III IRES has been identified in hepatitis A virus. A representative IRES structure is shown in panel A to illustrate the highly ordered secondary structures present in IRESs.24\n,\n216\n,\n271 Panel B shows the mechanism of cap-independent translation of picornaviral genomic RNA (via the IRES structure). It is believed that 40S ribosomal subunit recognition of an IRES and subsequent translation factor assembly is facilitated in part by RNA\u2013protein interactions; translation efficiency is further augmented though interaction with other cellular factors termed IRES-trans-acting factors (ITAFs). The illustration depicts a general representation of translation factor assembly at an IRES (refer to Fig. 15.4\nfor a description of the various translation factors depicted in this figure). eIF4G (4G) has been reported to participate in cap-independent translation either as an intact protein (e.g. HAV IRES)45 or in the truncated form (illustrated in Fig. 15.2) generated following enterovirus protease cleavage (see Fig. 15.4). ITAFs that are reported to be involved in interaction with picornavirus (e.g. enterovirus and hepatitis A virus) IRESs include pyrimidine tract binding protein, poly(rC) binding proteins and La autoantigen.24\n,\n120\n,\n149\n,\n216\n",

Following the hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP to GDP (panel A) which is facilitated by eIF2B, the cycle of factor assembly and translation initiation begins again. The enterovirus 2A and 3C proteases can inhibit cap-dependent translation via cleavage of factors such as eIF4G and PABP which disrupt the critical scaffolding function of these factors. The rotavirus nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) interacts with the 3\u2032 end of its viral mRNAs and can substitute for PABP, thereby displacing PABP from interaction with the initiation complex and negatively affecting translation. Translation initiation can be further regulated not only by the level and availability of the various factors described above\u2019 but also \u2018globally\u2019 by the modification state (e.g. phosphorylation) of particular subunits. As illustrated in panel A of Fig. 15.4\u2019 phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2 prevents eIF2B-mediated exchange of GDP for GTP and can occur (e.g. via dsRNA mediated activation of PKR, also see Fig. 17.5) following induction of an antiviral response, thus leading to a reduction in protein synthesis. It is of interest to note that at least three other kinases can also mediate this phosphorylation event, HRI (hemeregulated inhibitor), GCN2 (general control non-depressable 2) and PERK (PKR-like endiplasmic reticulum kinase). The latter is notable because of its connection to ER-stress induced apoptosis.51\n,\n224\n",

These molecular and cellular defenses may be considered as part of two broad categories: innate and adaptive immunity. A detailed discussion of innate versus adaptive immunity is beyond the scope of this review and the reader is referred to examples of articles in this subject area.3\n,\n6\n,\n25\n,\n36\n,\n50\n,\n64\n,\n310\n,\n333\n,\n343 Innate immunity includes those responses such as phagocytosis (e.g. macrophages), cytokine release (e.g. interferon, interleukins), cell/tissue surface defenses, and cell-mediated killing of virus infected cells (e.g. NK cells) that do not require specific viral antigen recognition in order to initiate and mediate the response. The development of antiviral antibodies and cell-mediated immunity are part of the more slowly developing and longer-lived antiviral response categorized as adaptive immunity. Cellular components of an adaptive immune response (e.g. B cells, T cells) can recognize viral proteins as foreign (antigens) and develop specifically targeted responses (e.g. antiviral antibodies, antigen-dependent cell-mediated killing) against domains (epitopes) of the viral antigen. Antibodies produced (humoral immunity) in response to virus infection can include members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) classes IgM, IgG, and IgA. An initial humoral response typically involves IgM production followed by a switch to IgG production later in the infection/antibody response. The highest levels of IgG are typically observed in the serum while those of IgA are typically observed at the mucosal tissue or fluids (e.g. intestine, saliva), and in these locations is sometimes referred to as secretory IgA.",

These complexes are formed when sub- or non-neutralizing quantities of anti-virus antibodies are bound to the virus particle,8\n,\n299\n,\n333 allowing the exposed Fc-region (\u2018tail\u2019) of the antibody to attach to cells via Fc receptors expressed on the cell surface, thus facilitating entry into that cell. This facilitated uptake of antibody bound virus complexes has been reported for a variety of both RNA and DNA viruses in cell culture and in vivo.299 The existence and utilization of this alternative pathway suggest that a mechanism exists for expanding viral tropism in vivo under conditions whereby a host immune response generates sub-neutralizing titers of anti-viral antibodies.217\n,\n257\n,\n322 Similar antibody-dependent enhancement or ADE has been reported for CV148\n,\n183 and HAV.94\n,\n95\n,\n110 In coxsackievirus B4 infection, ADE has been implicated in increased infectivity of the virus, implicating this mechanism in the development of myocarditis, at least in a mouse model.148\n,\n183 Dotzauer et al.\n94 demonstrated infection of both mouse and human hepatocytes using antibody\u2013HAV complexes, and suggested that the formation of these complexes may play a role in relapsing HAV infections through its function as a possible liver-directed carrier mechanism. It is also important to note that the expression of Fc\u03b3 receptor on phagocytic cells (viz. macrophages, neutrophils) is part of the viral clearance mechanism used by the immune system to remove virus\u2013antibody complexes from circulation, but ironically may contribute to the risk factors associated with disease322 as suggested by Rekand et al.\n257 regarding allelic polymorphisms in the Fc\u03b3IIIA receptor and risk factor development for acute illness (poliomyelitis).",

Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to either induce or suppress apoptosis. The former may function as a means to facilitate release of progeny virus from the infected host while the latter may aid in delaying cell destruction in order to provide additional time for virus replication and progeny production. The induction of apoptosis in virus infected cells may occur as a consequence of protein synthesis inhibition resulting from, for example, modification of protein kinase signaling factors or cellular metabolic pathways leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction (e.g. amino acid depletion, unfolded protein response); cleavage of critical translation factors (see Fig. 15.4); and/or antiviral (dsRNA and interferon) pathway activation. As shown in Fig. 15.5, one of the cellular responses to interaction with interferon can be the induction (increased expression) (*) of 2\u20135 OAS (oligoadenylate synthetase) and/or PKR, whose latent enzymatic activites are activated by viral dsRNA. dsRNA alone may function to induce expression of 2\u20135 OAS. Activated 2\u20135 OAS produces 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 adenylate oligomers which in turn activate latent, endogenous RNase L to ultimately affect protein synthesis by degrading RNA. Activated PKR phosphorylates serine 51 of eIF2 subunit \u03b1 resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis (see Fig. 15.4), The link between protein synthesis inhibition and activation of initiator caspases (----\u21e2) is not fully understood and appears to be in part virus and cell/tissue dependent. Central to apoptosis is the activation of members of a family of intracellular cysteine aspartyl-specific proteases known as caspases.77\n,\n88\n,\n103 Fourteen caspases have been identified with some reported to have a tissue-restricted specificity for activation. With few reported exceptions, capases require cleavage through an auto- or trans-catalytic process for their activation. The activation of initiator caspases (e.g. caspase 2, 8, 9, 10, 12) can occur through receptor (extrinsic) or intracellular initiated (intrinsic) mechanisms. This triggers activation of an enzymatic (caspase) cascade leading to downstream activation of effector caspases (e.g. caspase 3, 6, 7), resulting in targeted cleavage of various cellular proteins that ultimately mediate the observed physical and biochemical changes ascribed to apoptosis.",

            "text": "Regarding other important foodborne pathogens, PV causes reduction in PKR levels by an unknown mechanism possibly involving a cellular protease and poliovirus dsRNA.40 Evidence suggests that a reduction in cellular RNA synthesis via the degradation of a variety of RNA polymerase transcription factors247 coupled with an inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, results in a significant reduction in PKR levels. Other enteroviruses probably employ similar mechanisms. It is not known how HAV, NoV, or HEV evade the consequences of PKR activation. Infection with apoptotic as well as non-apoptotic strains of HAV did not result in PKR activation (Fig. 15.6\n). Figure 15.6 shows the results of dsRNA treatment and HAV infection on 2\u20135 OAS levels and PKR phosphorylation in FrhK4 cells. FrhK4 cells were either mock or HAV 18f infected [48 hpi (hours post-infection)], or mock or polyI:C (i.e. dsRNA) transfected (48 h) prior to protein extraction and denaturing gel electrophoresis/immunoblot analysis (see Goswami et al.\n126 and Kulka et al.\n187 for experimental details) for detection of 2\u20135 OAS (panel A), phosphorylated PKR (panel B), or nonphosphorylated PKR (panel C). Persistently HAV clone 1 infected (> 300 days pi) FrhK4 cells were mock or dsRNA treated (48 h) prior to protein extraction and immunoblot analysis. The positions of the 100 kDa and 69/71 kDa isoforms of 2\u20135 OAS are identified with arrows. 2\u20135 OAS was detected only in dsRNA-treated FrhK4 cells. Nonphosphorylated PKR (67 kDa) was present at equivalent levels in all samples, while phosphorylated PKR was not detected in any of the samples. Thus PKR phosphorylation may be defective in these cells, allowing HAV to establish a latent infection as suggested by Gale and Katze.117 dsRNA induced synthesis of OAS, while neither the apoptotic HAV strain (18f), nor the tissue culture adapted parent strain (clone 1) caused induction of OAS. Moreover, the clone 1 virus inhibited dsRNA induction of OAS. HAV is thus equipped with an as-yet unidentified function that can interfere with dsRNA activated antiviral mechanisms. The role of cellular protein modulators of PKR activation, which work by either binding to PKR or to dsRNA,158 are currently unknown. It has been suggested that lack of PKR activation may be the reason why some viruses are able to establish persistent or latent infection.117\n",

Since cells that have not been treated with IFN contain little or no OAS, viral infection of such cells does not trigger the RNase L-mediated RNA degradation owing to the lack of the activator 2\u20135A. The only exceptions known to date for the requirement of IFN for RNA degradation in virus infected cells are the apoptotic strains of HAV,125\n,\n187 and mouse coronavirus.16 Degradation of rRNA occurred following HAV infection in the absence of prior IFN treatment of the cells, and in the absence of detectable OAS mRNA or protein (Figs 15.6 and 15.7\n). In contrast, treatment of the same cell line with dsRNA resulted in rRNA degradation and also induction of the 69/71 kDa form of 2\u20135 OAS mRNA and protein (Figs 15.6 and 15.7); degradation of viral genomic RNA in virus infected cells did not occur,187 and virus replication was not inhibited. Along with the previous reports that HAV inhibits dsRNA-induced synthesis of IFN\u03b2\n48 and the absence of activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in HAV infected cells,125\n,\n187 it is likely that activation of RNase L in the FrhK4 cells following HAV infection is an example of the usurping of this activity by the virus to its advantage, analogous to the usurping of the PKR pathway by reovirus.76\n,\n294\n",

Restrictive conditions for virus replication occur in vivo owing to an IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 response to virus infection.

The genomic approach probably is more appropriate for viruses that produce latent or chronic infections in the host. Effects on cellular gene expression following infection of FrhK4 cells with the non-apoptotic HAV strain HM175 (clone 1) was compared with the effect of infection with the apoptotic strain HM175/18 f.187 Both transcription factors c-jun (AP-1) and c-myc were significantly up-regulated in 18f infected cells compared with clone 1.

Traditional methods for virus detection based on cytopathic effect on infected cells in culture cannot be applied to viruses of the norovirus group because a cell culture host is not available. Similarly, wild-type HAV grows very poorly in the available cell culture hosts and usually without cytopathic effect. Molecular methods based on the detection of virus genomes by RT-PCR (see Fig. 15.3) have been the basic tools for food virologists. However, attempts to detect viruses in foods by RT-PCR have met with limited success because of complicated multi-step processes required to concentrate viruses from foods. Seeding experiments have revealed severe losses of virus during such purification procedures. Most protocols also result in unacceptable levels of contaminants that severely inhibit the enzymatic reactions employed in RT-PCR. Moreover, the level of virus in foods contaminated during production or handling is expected to be low. In most cases, the distribution of virus in foods is not uniform, creating a sampling problem. Also the time lag between food consumption and onset of disease can be days to weeks, so that contaminated food is either totally consumed or discarded.",

Viral RNA is annealed to a primer and copied into the complementary strand (cDNA) by the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT). The primer may be complementary to sequences within the genome, the polyA region (if present) or be designed to target a broader range of sequences through the application of degenerate primer design. Degradation of the RNA strand may be accomplished through the use of an RT having endogenous RNaseH activity or by including the enzyme into the procedure (an optional step). A thermostable DNA polymerase, in combination with PCR primers which are designed as complementary sequences to the cDNA, is used to complete the PCR amplification. The typical PCR has a number of steps/cycles which usually include template denaturation, primer annealing, and primer extension. The final product of PCR is double-stranded DNA, termed an amplicon. The conditions (such as time and temperature) for each of the steps, as well as the total number of cycles, in the PCR are in part determined by the length and primary sequence of the primers, predicted length of amplicon, and target concentration. Since the target for PCR is single-stranded cDNA, the first round of PCR begins from the upstream, annealed primer. Following extension and denaturation, two complementary target DNA strands become available for both upstream and downstream primer annealing and extension. PCR cycling yields multiple copies of a sequence flanked by primer sequences. The length of the amplicon is determined by the relative position of the upstream and downstream primers on the target.",
