It is estimated that 257 million people worldwide are HBV chronic carriers and have a high risk of developing liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 1 million chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients die from these late complications each year. Conventional hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccination induces a protective antibody in most healthy vaccinated populations and has efficiently decreased the incidence rate of new HBV infections 2 . However, HBsAg fails to induce an effective antibody response in either preclinical animal models or patients with CHB infection, probably due to antigen-specific immune tolerance induced by the high load of viral antigens 3 . Therefore, an effective treatment strategy to eliminate and eradicate hepatitis B is highly desired.",

PreS1 plays a pivotal role in HBV entry by interacting with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), identified as the cellular receptor for HBV 4, 5 . Monoclonal antibodies against preS1 (MA18/7 and KR127) have been demonstrated to potently inhibit HBV infection in vivo and in vitro 6, 7 . In addition, anti-preS1 can also eliminate HBV + cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and phagocytosis 8 . Clinically, anti-preS1 is an early serum marker for HBV clearance 9, 10 . All these data suggest that anti-preS1 response might be beneficial for CHB treatment. Moreover, in CHB patients, immune tolerance to preS1, if any, appears to be much lower than that to HBsAg 3, 11 ,  as it only occurs in a trace amount compared with the latter in CHB patients 12, 13 , which favours antibody response induction. In fact, we recently showed that preS1 antigen vaccination, but not HBsAg, induced a neutralizing therapeutic antibody response in HBV carrier mice 11 . Nonetheless, preS1 appears not to be an efficient antibody inducer compared with HBsAg. This is reflected under both natural infections and active vaccinations 11, 14, 15 . Therefore, how to improve the immunogenicity of preS1 for enhanced therapeutic antibody response is currently a key issue for preS1-based therapeutic vaccine development.",

The anti-preS1 level continued to increase in the ferritin NP-preS1 immunization group and reached a peak around day 60, when an approximately 150 times higher antibody level was measured compared with the SC-preS1 control vaccine group, in which the antibody level still remained low. The antibody response gradually decreased but remained detectable at day 235. Furthermore, a boost immunization elicited a much stronger antibody response in the ferritin NP-preS1 group compared with the SC-preS1 control group (approximately 600-fold) (Fig. 1g) . The enhanced immunogenicity was also seen in the absence of CpG-1826 adjuvant ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) , suggesting an intrinsic feature of ferritin NPs, probably due to repeated antigen display and an NP carrier effect 16 .

The efficient antibody response is also not restricted to mouse strains ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ). In addition, physically mixing preS1 antigens with ferritin NPs instead of covalent binding could not elicit a strong anti-preS1 response, suggesting the necessity of antigen display on the ferritin NPs (Fig. 1h) .

There is no detectable anti-preS1 response in the established HBV carrier mice, consistent with the clinical observation 29, 30 . However, after the second boost on day 63, the ferritin NP-preS1 vaccine induced a significant amount of anti-preS1, which was barely detectable in the SC-preS1 group (Fig. 3b) . Meanwhile, preS1 antigen and HBsAg in the sera declined significantly with the induction of anti-preS1 (Fig. 3c,d) . On day 147, about 10 weeks after the last immunization, serum HBV DNA was also significantly reduced in the ferritin NP-preS1 group but not in the control groups (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, in four out of seven mice in the ferritin NP-preS1 group, serum HBV DNA dropped to undetectable levels, also showing barely detectable HBsAg and significant amounts of anti-HBs (Fig. 3e) , suggesting potential for a functional cure. In addition, the HBV core antigen as detected by immunological histological chemistry staining (Fig. 3f ) and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) as detected by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 3g) were also significantly diminished in the liver of the ferritin NP-preS1 group. The clearance of HBV core antigen in the liver was not accompanied by liver injury (Fig. 3h) . Thus, ferritin-preS1 NPs plus CpG functioned as an effective and non-pathogenic therapeutic vaccine in the mouse model of protracted HBV infection.",

DC depletion resulted in a lower titre of IgG response, indicating that DCs played an essential role in T-cell-dependent antibody response (Fig. 5g) . However, IgM antibodies, produced by early-activated B cells largely in a T-cellindependent manner 32 , were not affected (Fig. 5g) .

            "text": "In addition to DCs, SIGNR1 + macrophages captured ferritin NP efficiently (Fig. 4c ). SIGNR1 + macrophages showed markedly reduced transcript abundance for lysosome-associated membrane proteins-1/2, lysozyme and lysosomal proteases compared with SIGNR1 \u2212 F4/80 + (abbreviated as F4/80 + ) macrophages ( Supplementary Fig. 9a ), indicating their poor degradation ability and potential role as antigen retainers for B cell activation. To directly test this, four subsets of APCs (miDCs, rDCs, SIGNR1 + macrophages and F4/80 + macrophages) were isolated as shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 from dLNs 3 d after ferritin NP-HEL (hen egg lysozyme) immunization and were incubated with MD4 B cells in vitro for 24 h. Except for SIGNR1 + macrophages, no other populations activated MD4 B cells as demonstrated by the upregulation of CD69 and CD86 (Fig. 6a) , indicating a durable retention of antigen by SIGNR1 + macrophages. In vivo, a CSF1R-blocking antibody-mediated SIGNR1 + macrophage depletion ( Supplementary  Fig. 9b) 33 resulted in significantly reduced anti-preS1 IgM and IgG 10 d after the first immunization (Fig. 6b) . On day 21, significantly lower levels of anti-preS1 IgG and fewer preS1-specific IgG antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were also observed in anti-CSF1Rtreated mice (Fig. 6c,d) . Thus, SIGNR1 + macrophages play a vital role in early B cell activation and IgG response. SIGNR1 + macrophages are mainly distributed in medulla and interfollicular regions in LNs. We wondered how they can transfer antigen for B cell activation. On CpG immunization, a cluster of SIGNR1 + cells emerged in the follicular regions of dLNs (Fig. 6e,  top panel) , which express CD169 rather than CD11c, indicating their macrophage identity (Supplementary Fig. 10a ). This suggested that SIGNR1 + macrophages might directly carry antigens to follicles for B cell activation. To understand how this migration is regulated, we examined the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis, given the abundant expression of CXCL13 in B cell follicles and its important role for follicular migration 40 . In Cxcr5 \u2212/\u2212 mice, no SIGNR1 + cells could be found in B cell follicles on immunization, in stark contrast to WT mice (Fig. 6e, bottom panel) . In supporting these data, flow cytometric analysis showed that SIGNR1 + macrophages, but not SIGNR1 \u2212 macrophages or SIGNR1 + DCs, significantly upregulated CXCR5 on immunization ( Supplementary Fig. 10b ). The upregulation of CXCR5 appears to be a direct effect of CpG and unique to macrophages, as CpG alone induces CXCR5 expression on isolated primary SIGNR1 + macrophages but not DCs under in vitro culture ( Supplementary Fig. 10c ). Given the aberrant LN organization in Cxcr5 \u2212/\u2212 mice, WT:Cxcr5 \u2212/\u2212 mixed bone marrow chimaeric mice were generated and confirmed the macrophage cell intrinsic role of CXCR5 on their migration to B cell follicles (Fig. 6f) .",

In the previous studies 34, 46, 47 , subcapsular sinus macrophages were considered immotile and the particulate antigen was speculated to be transferred to B cells via transcytosis or cytoplasmic membrane movement from the subcapsular sinus side to the other side facing the B cell follicles 19, 46, 48 . In our study, we found that SIGNR1 + macrophages, but not other macrophages or DCs, can upregulate CXCR5 on immunization and migrate to the follicular regions. When CXCR5 is lacking, antigen-loaded macrophages fail to activate B cells, which might suggest a previously unrecognized means of particulate antigen transfer by migrating SIGNR1 + macrophages. Whether CXCR5 deficiency could impair other functions of macrophages, resulting in impaired B cell activation, remains to be studied in future. It should be noted that the upregulation of CXCR5 on macrophages is dependent on CpG instead of ferritin NPs themelves. How CpG stimulation upregulates macrophage CXCR5 expression is still unknown. Whether other adjuvants have similar effects also remains to be systemically investigated. Nonetheless, ferritin NPs seem to be able to employ this machinery for enhanced antibody response.",
