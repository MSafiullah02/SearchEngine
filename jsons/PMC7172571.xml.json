Mechanisms for the increase in risk with influenza remain unclear but may reflect greater cardiovascular stress in the setting of infection, reduced oxygenation in the setting of lung disease, or systemic inflammation with consequent thrombosis or intraplaque disruption predisposing to rupture.",

Countries and regions with fewer resources are likely to face higher mortality and morbidity than areas with greater access to care, particularly as increasing numbers of cases overwhelm local healthcare systems, as is already being seen in parts of Italy.
