The only inclusion criteria was being involved in the direct response to the 2009 novel H1N1 flu pandemic, defined as individuals who work in a hospital, health care, or public health agency that has handled/managed at least 1 confirmed positive case of novel influenza A H1N1 in 2009.",

Snacks were provided to the participants during the focus groups. The nominal group method was used to elicit information on the topics of interest.4 The focus group method (ie, opening-ended questions) was used to elicit details from participants' experience with the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic.5 Participants were informed that information collected would remain anonymous and that all responses were voluntary. Focus group sessions were audiotaped, and the digital recordings were transcribed verbatim. Content analysis included identifying, coding, and categorizing participants' response to the questions of interest. In addition, major themes that emerged were identified and categorized. Subjects' demographic data were obtained for descriptive statistics. In addition, participants were asked to complete an 11-item survey containing items related to the novel H1N1 flu pandemic, such as hospital or agency protocols for worker protection, isolation, and PPE usage during the event. The Institutional Review Board of Saint Louis University approved this study. APIC funded the costs of the food and meeting location for the focus groups; Saint Louis University covered the costs of data transcription. Quotations that characterize the major themes are reported. The words enclosed in brackets of the quotations are used to explain the respondents' quotes and are not the participants' words.",

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that all health care workers be fit tested prior to respirator use in health care settings.6 Fit testing is a relatively time-consuming process that requires staff and supplies, including various sizes and styles of respirators. Annual fit testing is part of most hospitals' respiratory protection program and is often spread out throughout the year. The novel H1N1 pandemic posed unique challenges for hospitals because of the need to fit test a large number of staff in a short period of time and the desire to conserve respirators. This worked well in some facilities, but other hospitals had more difficulty.

However, it was soon discovered that the sensitivity of these rapid tests was very low for novel H1N1, leading to numerous false negatives.7 Confirmatory testing consists of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral culture; this testing is usually obtained via state health department reference laboratories. The focus group participants stated that many patients with negative rapid tests were later found to be positive for novel H1N1 on RT-PCR or viral culture.

Historically, IPs have been concerned primarily about hospitals and acute care settings. The novel H1N1 pandemic demonstrates the need to implement infection prevention strategies in all health care settings, including ambulatory care centers, physician offices, home health, and long-term care. Infection prevention emergency management guidance for these nonacute care settings has been lacking. It is essential that infection prevention recommendations be developed for these settings to help control disease spread and ultimately prevent and control surge in hospitals. One essential component of these recommendations is the identified need for a stronger focus on occupational health. Staff surge capacity is necessary to maintain functionality of health care facilities during pandemics, and healthy staff contributes strongly to sustaining this capacity. Occupational health issues that need to be addressed include having policies and procedures for screening/triaging staff, furloughing employees, and better sick leave practices to prevent ill health care providers from coming to work sick during pandemics.",

These changing practices must be communicated carefully to prevent mistrust among the staff. Failure to do so can result in poor adherence to infection prevention practices because of confusion among health care professionals. This could lead to secondary transmission in health care facilities and occupational exposures. Health care professionals should be told that outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as novel H1N1, are expected to bring rapidly changing case definitions, surveillance methodologies, and control measures. These changes should be evidence based and communicated to staff as clearly and concisely as possible to prevent confusion and mistrust.",

Conflicting guidance on infection prevention for novel H1N1 has led to a lot of confusion among health care professionals and frustration for IPs. One third of the focus group participants reported that they changed isolation precautions and protective measures midway through response to the novel H1N1 outbreak. Focus group participants also reported that the potentially unnecessary use of N95 respirators caused much confusion for staff and resulted in a shortage of supplies in their facilities, according to those who participated in the focus groups. These focus groups occurred the week before the World Health Organization officially declared the novel H1N1 outbreak a pandemic, yet hospitals were already running out of supplies\u2014even after regional and national stockpiles were deployed. One quarter of all focus group participants' facilities ran out of respiratory protection supplies during the spring of 2009, and almost one quarter needed to implement a reuse policy for respirators to conserve limited resources. Hospitals need better plans for obtaining or reusing necessary equipment and supplies during patient surges.",

Structured surveys with closed-ended responses (opposed to the open-ended questions used in this study) may have revealed different opinions about references materials needed for future pandemics and educational priorities for IPs. It is not known whether the IPs who chose to participate differed from those who were eligible but chose not to participate. Therefore, the information presented here may not be generalizable to all hospitals. This is especially true for the survey questions regarding hospital or agency protocols for worker protection, isolation, and PPE usage during the event; the small sample size needed for focus group methodologies may limit the generalizability of the survey results.",

This study identifies lessons learned from the first part of the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza A pandemic and highlights gaps in emergency management most in need of being addressed: infection prevention in nonacute care settings, employee health during pandemics, communication, PPE availability and recommendations for use, and maintaining quality of care during times of rapidly changing and conflicting recommendations. IPs must continue to address gaps in pandemic planning. One way to accomplish this is through the creation and distribution of IP-specific educational tools and reference materials for emergency management. The topics identified by IPs who experienced the first wave of the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza A pandemic should be used as the basis for these new educational initiatives.",
