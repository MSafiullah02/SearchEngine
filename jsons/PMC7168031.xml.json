To do this, novel delivery tools are strongly required to increase their specificity and therapeutic index, respectively1. A variety of bio\u2010drugs, including peptides and proteins, are now produced on a commercial scale and should be intracellularly delivered to exert their therapeutic action inside the cytoplasm or onto specific organelles. Cells poorly internalize most drugs because they cross the membrane rather inefficiently2. Many treatments will not be active because drug concentration in the target disease site is not sufficient to generate a therapeutic effect. Moreover, a large amount of the drug is also delivered to normal tissues, which could result in severe side effects (low therapeutic index). Another important example is gene therapy. The latter is a method for the treatment or prevention of disease that uses genes to provide the patient with the genetic information necessary to produce specific therapeutic proteins required to correct or to modulate a disease using plasmids encoding for the proteins or down modulating the target through the use of interference methods, such as small interference RNAs (siRNA) or microRNAs 3.

The uptake mechanism also plays a key role. Many vectors have been demonstrated to involve essentially endocytic mechanisms. However, endosomal entrapment can limit their activity; in fact, only a small quantity of the agent can escape this environment to achieve the specific desired biological site of action.

In fact, treatments of neurological disorders remain limited because of the inability of therapeutic agents to effectively cross the BBB that protects brain against invading organisms and unwanted substances and represents an obstacle for the penetration of drugs4. Most strategies to transport drugs inside the CNS determine the disruption of the anatomical texture of the BBB, thus impairing its natural function. In particular, effective delivery approaches should be cautiously assessed considering their impact on the overall protective function of the BBB. At the moment, delivery strategies across the BBB can be divided in invasive and non\u2010invasive approaches; invasive approaches involve the temporary disruption of the BBB, the intraventricular, or the intracerebral administration, whereas non\u2010invasive approaches involve the intravenous administration of the drug coupled to the carrier, which undergoes a receptor or adsorptive\u2010mediated transcytosis or the intranasal route. On these bases, targeted delivery of a drug to the intended site of action in the brain represents one of most promising non\u2010invasive approaches to overcome BBB, combining the advantages of brain targeting, high incorporation capacity, reduction of side effects, and circumvention of the multidrug efflux system5.",

In this case, the efforts are addressed on how to introduce foreign nucleic acid or other pharmacological weapons into the cells. We can derive useful suggestions by understanding the virus infection process. In fact, viral carriers such as adenoviral vectors6 and retroviral/lentiviral vectors7, 8 were used for the first time in the past decades. They can bind their hosts and introduce their genetic or other organic materials into the target cells, thus mimicking an infectious process. Viral vectors are prepared removing the viral genome and substituting it with the therapeutic oligonucleotides into the viral husk9. These delivery systems showed relatively high transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo but raising several clinical safety and administration concerns. The latter pushed on the research on non\u2010viral carriers that have limited side effects if compared with attenuated viruses. In this light, the use of viral components that favor the intracellular uptake of the nanoparticles could be useful in drug delivery strategies. Therefore, sparked by the increasing knowledge on structures and life cycles of several viruses, many virus\u2010mimicking non\u2010viral carriers are being developed for therapeutic applications. In the present mini review, we will briefly describe how viral properties can be exploited for intracellular delivery using viral\u2010derived peptides10, modular viral\u2010derived protein assemblies11, and virus nanoparticles (VNPs)12.",

In fact, only a few endocytic mechanisms are involved. To bind cell surface, a wide variety of different proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are used by viruses. These molecules are generally considered attachment factors that simply enable viruses to bind and to concentrate on the cell surface. Other interactions on the cell surface involve real receptors, which in addition to binding, actively promote their entry into cells, mediate conformational changes in the virus particle, and trigger signaling pathways that promote the overall infectious process. Thus, the first and highly specific step of viral infection is binding to the receptors present on the plasma membranes 14, 15, which may be either primary receptors or co\u2010receptors, the latter having lower binding affinities, and being involved only after primary receptors in order to enhance the binding strength16.

Viruses use several endocytic routes for cellular internalization: caveolar and clathrin\u2010dependent or caveolae\u2010independent. In clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, a ligand binds to a specific receptor and determines the clustering of the ligand\u2013receptor complexes in coated pits on the plasma membrane, which then invaginates and pinches off from the membrane to form intracellular clathrin\u2010coated vesicles. Their depolymerization and fusion with each other result in formation of late endosomes that further fuse with lysosomes, where the cargo is degraded19. Although lysosomes represent a cul\u2010de\u2010sac for many molecules utilizing this cell internalization route, viruses have developed the ability to avoid lysosomal degradation escaping into the cytosol. Therefore, the penetration event follows endosomal internalization and is necessary for the delivery to the cytosol. In the case of enveloped viruses, penetration invariably involves membrane fusion, which, similarly to the already described fusion at the plasma membrane, is mediated by specific viral glycoproteins. The main difference between the two modes of fusion is that once inside the endosome, the viruses fuse their envelope with the limiting membrane of the endocytic vacuoles from the luminal side20.",

The process of non\u2010enveloped viruses entry is generally started with a mechanism reminiscent of the entry of enveloped viruses, namely, triggering a conformational change of capsid proteins as a consequence of receptor binding or pH lowering. The conformational change allows the release of viral components with membrane lytic activity, which binds to the cell membrane, disrupt the lipid bilayer, and convey the viral particle across the membrane.

In this light, viruses are a suitable tool in order to design strategies to stealth the endosomal\u2010lysosomal pathway and the consequent drug sequestration 52, 53. Peptide LAH4, from a family of His\u2010rich peptides, has also been shown to complex DNA and efficiently deliver nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells by pH\u2010triggered lysis of endosomes54, 55. There are many differences on the viral capsid and membrane proteins and peptides that drive the penetration and endosomal escape depending upon the different classes of viruses. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of these biological processes are common and depend upon similar structural characteristics of the viral moieties involved 56.",

The peptide contains particular residues that are crucial for its capacity to interact with target lipid membranes. In particular, it is rich in hydrophobic residues that allow the peptide to enter into the bilayer and destabilize membranes. Fusion peptides are characterized by a typical amphipatic \u03b1\u2010helix structure, which mediates lipid\u2013protein interactions during the binding of proteins to membranes, thereby triggering membrane fusion and translocation 67. Confocal microscopy studies on live cells showed the gH625 ability to cross membrane bilayers (Figure 3) and translocate into the cytosol as compared with (transactivator of transcription protein from HIV\u20101) TAT peptide, which mainly enter cells by endocytosis 68. A shorter version of this peptide (missing the first histidine at position 625) was investigated in a study by Tu and Kim 69 and found to enhance the transfection efficiency of cationic liposomes more than 30\u2010fold in human cell lines improving the intracellular penetration of liposomes or lipoplexes. Another example of the suitability of gH625 is given by the effective delivery of intrinsically disordered proteins. A genetically modified recombinant gH625\u2010c\u2010prune was prepared through conjugation of c\u2010prune with gH625. C\u2010prune is the C\u2010terminal domain of h\u2010prune, overexpressed in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers, interacting with multiple partners and representing an ideal target for inhibition of cancer development. Its C\u2010terminal domain results in an intrinsically disordered domain and is easily transduced through biomembranes due to net negative charge of gH625 70. gH625\u2010c\u2010prune fusion protein exhibited the ability to cross biomembranes, opening a new scenario for the use of gH625 as a novel multifunctional carrier 68. The successful use of fusogenic peptides in drug delivery systems is dependent on the specific targeting of drugs to tumor cells with minimal toxicity.",

Nanotechnology has the potential to create platforms that combine targeting and delivery with imaging and targeted cell uptake (theranostics), 72, 73.

Liposomes are non\u2010toxic, biodegradable, and non\u2010immunogenic; encapsulated drugs are protected from chemical or metabolic degradation after injection and their toxicity is reduced thanks to the decreased exposure of the drug to susceptible healthy tissues and increased antitumor activity resulting from a relatively long systemic circulation time (achieved through surface modification with polyethylene glycol or other polymers), an extended exposure, and tumor selective accumulation in sites of tumor growth. The association of a drug with liposomes markedly changes its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and lowers systemic toxicity; moreover, in order to enhance the antitumor efficacy, many research groups are also working to improve cellular internalization of liposomes through the addition of surface ligands such as penetratin, TAT, and membranotropic 83, 84.",

A typical example of natural molecular assemblies and containers is represented by virus\u2010based nanoparticles, which are nanocages or nanorods assembled from capsid proteins of viruses obtained exploiting the recent and rapid advances in protein engineering and material science. Virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) are multi\u2010subunit protein complexes able to self\u2010assemble and form higher\u2010order structures mimicking native 3D conformation of viruses. The main difference with native viruses is that VLPs do not carry, hidden into the capsid protective shell, the viral genetic material but are empty cases or incorporate selected pieces of genetic material. Therefore, VLPs lacking a complete viral genome are unable to replicate and non\u2010infectious. Over the last three decades, VLPs have been demonstrated very useful for the production of safe vaccines 97, 98, and the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1986 was the vaccine against hepatitis B virus. From many points of view, VLPs are indistinguishable from VNP, in fact, the basic strategy behind the production of VLP and VNP is exactly the same: genetic engineering of capsid protein and their expression in microbial factories (e.g., bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and plants). The principal difference is that VNPs are intended for creating novel material to be applied to the broader field of nanotechnology to solve different material\u2010based problems and in the scope of the present review for drug delivery. Because of the appropriate size generally ranging from 20 to 200 nm, their homogeneity, possible functionalization, easy of modification through chemical and genetic routes, and possibility of convenient preparation and scale up in microbial factories VNP are emerging as the most promising platform for gene and drug delivery applications 12, 99, 100. Plant and animal viruses and also bacteriophages have been employed for producing VNPs. The principal plant viruses include Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Brome Mosaic Virus, Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV), and Red Clover Necrotic Mosaic Virus, whereas animal viruses are principally represented by SV40, Alphavirus, Polyoma JC virus, and adenovirus.
