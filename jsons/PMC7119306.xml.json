Identification of this virus was based on virological data, sequence homology, and gene constellation. Clinically and cytopathologically, infection with human metapneumovirus resembles that of respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children. Results of a serological survey1 showed that human metapneumovirus usually infects young children; all 80 children in the survey in the Netherlands at the age of 5 years were seropositive for the virus. We investigated the frequency of human metapneumovirus in children admitted to the paediatric department of Turku University Hospital, Finland for acute expiratory airway obstruction.",

All patients were given nebulised salbutamol. The patients were randomly allocated to receive 2 mg/kg oral prednisolone per day for 3 days or placebo. The study code has not yet been opened.
