The upper airway extends from the nose or mouth to the larynx (Seikel et al. 2005) , but its functions, in the context of ventilation, extend to the entire airway. Maintenance of airway volume and ventilation is actively controlled by the centrally coordinated activities of nasal, oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal upper airway muscles and those of the pump muscles. These act in concert with lower airway smooth muscle. Effective breathing requires that the brain coordinates ventilatory functions with cardiovascular function and with other motor acts, e.g., swallowing, postural changes, and speech. Adaptations in breathing must occur appropriately, rapidly, and constantly. Protective and mechanical changes occur in milliseconds. Changes in circulatory gas transport alter breathing within seconds. Other adjustments optimize breathing in tune with changes in growth, aging, metabolism, and the environment. This chapter addresses how each upper airway structure plays critical roles in the dynamic processes of breathing.",

Given its vascularity, it is not surprising that the nose is a source of nitric oxide, that trauma to the nasal passages can be induced by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) prongs and other cannulae, and that epistaxis can require hospital admission.",

It can increase its resistance rapidly, switching on a watery secretion \"like a tap\" (Godfrey 1994) , and can trigger laryngeal closure and reduced ventilatory drive (Editorial 1992) . The extreme protective reflex response to nasal irritation is the dive reflex that is typified by apnea with glottic closure, bradycardia, and redistribution of blood flow to the brain, heart, and adrenals (see also Sect. 47.3.1) (de Burgh Daly 1997; Editorial 1992) . The dive reflex can be triggered by nasal water, tobacco smoke, or ice applied to the trigeminal area (Angell James and de Burgh Daly 1969; de Burgh Daly 1997) . Water entry into the nose is dramatic even for adults who \"suffer a sense of impending suffocation and the almost impossibility of voluntarily making an inspiratory effort\" (de Burgh Daly 1997) . Exaggerated dive reflex responses can cause total upper airway closure and cardiac arrest and have been implicated in accidental and deliberately induced deaths (de Burgh Daly 1997).",

            "text": "Nasal breathing in the newborn and infant is the predominant but not obligatory form of breathing and is related to the high position of the epiglottis ( Fig. 4 .1) (Seikel et al. 2005 ). There is a nasal cycle whereby resistance alternates from one nostril to the other every 2-4 h in 80 % of humans (Widdicombe 1986) . Pressure in the axilla or on the lateral chest increases ipsilateral nasal resistance (Widdicombe 1986) . Resistance is highest in the regions adjacent to the external ostia, whose dimensions are altered by the alae nasi muscles that cause nasal flaring during exercise hyperpnea and respiratory distress, especially in newborns. Newborn nasal resistance exceeds that of the adult in absolute terms but is less than that of their lower airways. Nearly half of the adult's total airway resistance is nasal. Thus, minor increases in nasal resistance can produce major overall effects on breathing (Editorial ). In adult humans, nasal occlusion results in a switch to mouth breathing in <5 s (Editorial 1992) . Both this switch to oral breathing and the resumption of nasal breathing following release of the occlusion are delayed by nasal and pharyngeal anesthesia. Occlusion of the nasal passages in infants results in mouth breathing in ~8 s (range <1-32 s) (Editorial 1992; Rodenstein 2004) . The response is quicker with advancing age but is decreased in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, more so at 6 weeks than in the newborn period (Editorial 1992) . These observations led to a proposal that the response may be related to the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Editorial 1992) . In premature infants, the change to oral breathing results in a sixfold increase in pulmonary resistance, which over time might result in fatigue with hypoventilation (Miller et al. 1987) . Oral breathing places an increased burden on the lower airway to modify the temperature and humidity of inspired gas, presumably via changes in lower airway vascularity. Preventing nasal breathing can decrease gas exchange and functional residual capacity (FRC) (Editorial 1992) . Postoperative nasal packing in adults can lead to arterial hypoxemia, apnea, and sleep disturbance, with the latter also occurring in normal volunteers after local anesthesia of the nasal passages (Editorial 1992) . In newborn lambs, nasal obstruction also affects gas exchange, with hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis being observed. These effects are aggravated by carotid body denervation. The impact of nasal obstruction diminishes with advancing age (Editorial 1992) . Blockage of the nose (choanal stenosis being an extreme example) can cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Marcus 2000) . Human neonates whose nasal resistance is increased by birth trauma or trauma secondary to repeated suctioning breathe orally. They can have cyanotic episodes, stridor, and hypercapnia; these problems disappear with resolution of the nasal injury (Miller et al. 1987) .",

Pharyngeal patency is a function of the cavity dimensions (Rodenstein 2004 ) and the balance between the opening forces exerted by pharyngeal muscle activities and the collapsing ones exerted by the tissue-intrapharyngeal pressure gradient and by pharyngeal mucosal adhesion (Fig. 4.2) . Patency is critically influenced by posture. Narrowing occurs with neck flexion and hyperextension and can alter cavity pressures required to achieve flow. Narrowing can also follow an inspiratory occlusion of the mouth/nose (a load) that augments diaphragmatic activity and thus negative pressure within the pharynx. Upper and lower airway afferents induce reflex compensatory change in glossopharyngeal muscles to offset the load effect ( Fig. 4 .2) (Bailey and Fregosi 2006) . Obstructive apnea occurs during sleep in ~1-4 % of children and adults (Marcus 2000) . In children, a persistent partial form of upper airway obstruction, obstructive hypoventilation, is seen (Marcus 2000) . In adults, a spectrum of decreased inspiratory airflow is seen in snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, and OSA. Pharyngeal OSA occurs when a critical tissue pressure (P crit ) exceeds the intrapharyngeal opening pressure (Fig. 4 .2) (Marcus 2000; Dempsey et al. 2010) and is influenced by factors that alter pharyngeal dimensions, namely, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity (less common in children than adults), low subglottic airway volume, and craniofacial structural abnormalities. The major role played by the central motor output to the oral cavity and pharyngeal muscles that modify P crit is emphasized by the fact that OSA occurs only in sleep, predominantly in REM sleep in children (Marcus 2000) . The following factors also stress the importance of central control in OSA. Obstructive apnea occurring during mixed apnea in preterm newborns involves a direct central mechanism, as shown by the onset of pharyngeal and/or laryngeal closure before diaphragmatic activation (Idiong et al. 1998 ) (see Sect. 47.3.1) . In adults pharyngeal closure can accompany central apnea (Marcus 2000) . Central arousal patterns during OSA differ between children and adults (Marcus 2000) . Other factors affecting the incidence of OSA are gender, a familial tendency, and racial/ethnic factors (Marcus 2000) . Anti-inflammatory medications can benefit OSA, suggesting a role for inflammation in its etiology (Praud and Dorion 2008) . Therapy with NCPAP improves OSA by increas-ing intrapharyngeal pressure and its transverse diameter (Rodenstein 2004) , by augmenting lower airway volume and probably by stimulating breathing via pharyngeal pressure sensors (Angell James and de Burgh Daly 1969) . In children and adults with OSA, CPAP therapy can improve their metabolism.",

This separation of the nasopharyngeal-laryngeal air passage from the oropharyngeal nutritive passage enables the term infant to breathe and feed simultaneously but with decreased ventilatory drive. This ability is not developed in the preterm neonate whose sucking pattern is also immature (Lau 2006) . Coordination of sucking-swallowing-breathing is defined by the ability to feed \"by mouth with no overt signs of aspiration, oxygen desaturation, apnea, or bradycardia\" and when \"a ratio of 1:1:1 or 2:2:1 suck: swallow: breathe\" is attained (Lau 2006) . Safe swallowing occurs at end-expiration and end-inspiration (Lau 2006) . In term newborns, 55 % of swallows occur at these points of the breathing cycle.

Without NNS, \"the lungs rapidly fill with these secretions, producing death within a few days\" (Thach 2005) . When pharyngeal secretions reach a critical volume, neural receptors, in the interarytenoid notch, stimulate the laryngochemoreflex which triggers NNS (Thach 2005) . The critical pharyngeal volume for NNS may be increased by applied positive pharyngeal pressure, providing an explanation for the decrease in NNS frequency with CPAP (Thach 2005) . In adult humans NNS occurs mainly during expiration. In infants NNS occurs at any time in the respiratory cycle (Thach 2005) . Volitional swallowing in adults clears the pharynx and reduces the protective laryngeal adductor reflex. During sleep, the protection provided by NNS and glottic closure is imperfect, and some aspiration is common in normal individuals (Thach 2005) . Swallow breaths are short inspirations that precede a swallow, occurring when the upper pharyngeal sphincters are closed (Thach 2005) . These breaths are thought to result in pharyngeal air being inhaled as opposed to being swallowed (Thach 2005) . The increased gastric air found when positive pharyngeal pressure is applied suggests that CPAP can alter normal pharyngeal clearance mechanisms and infers the need to titrate the applied pressure carefully (Thach 2005) . Finally, swallowing may be related to sleep apnea and be part of recovery from sleep apnea (see Sect. 47.3.1) (Thach 2005) .",

There is no sensation of expiratory glottic closure in eupnea. Accurate, rapid laryngeal opening and closure maintains an optimal subglottic airway volume, ensures tidal volume changes that enable gas exchange, and enhances airway patency and surfactant secretion.

The posterior cricoarytenoids (PCA) are the sole abductors of the vocal cords. There are several adductors, with the thyroarytenoids (TA) being the major ones ( Fig. 4.4) . Some adductors, the cricothyroid and the vocalis part of TA, enhance abduction by tensing the vocal cords. This restricts vertical movement, improving flow control in the more horizontal plane. The magnitude of abductor activity exceeds that of the adductors when glottic size is increased and vice versa, consistent with relationships between glottic size and flow resistance (England et al. 1982a; Insalaco et al. 1990 ; Kuna et al. 1988 ). Animal studies indicate that, in general, glottic opening and closing are achieved by reciprocal laryngeal abductor and adductor activities ( Fig. 4 .5) (Bartlett 1989; Harding 1986; Hutchison et al. 1993) . Concurrent actions of laryngeal abductor and adductor muscles during inspiration and expiration may occur in adult humans, but their nature is unknown Kuna et al. 1988 Kuna et al. , 1990 .",

            "text": "Clinically, grunting is the expiratory noise produced when air flows through a partially closed glottis (Harrison et al. 1968) . Total glottic closure is silent but sensed. Physiologically, grunting is a breathing pattern seen throughout life. It consists of a spectrum of degrees and timings of expiratory laryngeal closure, associated with volume retention and increased subglottic pressure, followed by laryngeal opening with a rapid return to baseline end-expiratory volume (EEV) (Figs. 4.5 and 4.6) (see Sect. 47.3.1) . In newborns with respiratory distress, Harrison et al. showed that when grunting was prevented by endotracheal intubation, without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), their oxygenation worsened (Harrison et al. 1968 ). This finding established the role of airway PEEP and likely influenced the introduction of CPAP therapy. Harrison et al. also focused on venous return (Harrison et al. 1968 ), stressing the importance of cardiac function in grunting. The outline of the volume-time trace in grunting (Figs. 4.5 and 4.6 ) resembles that of a volume with a prolonged inspiratory time, as used in artificial ventilation to improve oxygenation. Pre-surfactant, this strategy reduced the required peak inspiratory pressure and decreased the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Today, the maintenance of subglottic volume, the \"open lung\" approach, is a fundamental tenet of all ventilatory support. In keeping with the concept of alveolar interdependence, airway volume recruitment is achieved not by a maximal prolonged inflation but with an augmented breath (sigh) followed by an expiratory hold, mimicking the volume-time profile of grunting or of airway pressure release ventilation. Spontaneous sighs can be biphasic, with inspiration being Hutchison and Bignall (2008)) interrupted briefly by laryngeal closure. This mechanism may reset vagal afferent feedback, avoiding a Hering-Breuer inflation reflex and possible loss of the acquired volume (see Sect. 47.3.1) . In summary, human and animal data emphasize the importance of laryngeal control of expiratory subglottic airway volume. This central control strategy whereby airway pressure is dependent upon volume control has been shown by the study of bubble physics to produce a more stable mechanical system (Hildebrandt 1974) . Thus, coordinated central control of laryngeal and pump muscles is a major focus in the control of breathing. This knowledge can be applied in respiratory support (Hutchison and Bignall 2008) .",

In fetal lambs, during the highvoltage electrocorticogram (ECoG) state, apnea (no phasic laryngeal abductor or diaphragmatic activities) and tonic laryngeal adductor activity occur. Laryngeal adductor activity can be enhanced by laryngeal contact with cooled lung liquid, by fetal movements, by \"arousals,\" by swallowing, by uterine contractures, and by fetal hypoxemia. In the low-voltage ECoG state, laryngeal and diaphragmatic activities are similar to those seen postnatally (Harding 1986 ). Hypercapnia mainly enhances fetal breathing in the low-voltage ECoG state (Harding 1986 ). In general, active laryngeal retardation of lung liquid egress is reported in the absence of fetal breathing movements and is related to lung growth (Harding 1986 ). Stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) produces laryngeal closure (Harding 1986 ) that will prevent aspiration of noxious material, e.g., meconium. The coordination of the acts of fetal swallowing (Harding 1986 ) and \"inspiratory\" activities of the respiratory muscles stresses the developmental importance of the controller's ability to switch patterns rapidly between upper airway closure (laryngeal adduction) with lack of diaphragmatic activity (apnea) and laryngeal abductor and pump activities (see Sect. 47.3.1).",

            "text": "Airway volume is high in the fetus compared to the newborn. It has been speculated that during different fetal behavioral states, the brain is setting the homeostatic limits for high and low airway volume to prepare the fetus for the major needs of subglottic volume control at birth (Hutchison 2007 ) (see also Sect. 47.3.1). Life's greatest airway volume challenge, the establishment and maintenance of an air-filled airway at birth, is usually overcome without a hitch by breathing patterns whose complexities exceed those used during the majority of adult life. At birth, an incremental breathing pattern retains more inspired volume than is expired ( Fig. 4 .6) (Hutchison et al. 1994) . Incremental breathing shares features with grunting with the addition of timing changes in laryngeal and pump muscle activities at end-expiration when the onset of pump muscle activity occurs before laryngeal muscles open the glottis fully. The result is a decrease in expired volume and an increase in EEV (Hutchison et al. 1994 ). This incremental mechanical process is aided by the airway stability accrued from the increased end-expiratory positive subglottic pressure that limits the development of a negative airway pressure during inspiration. Given their tendency to chest wall distortion, it is not surprising that incremental breathing can occur in preterm neonates (Eichenwald et al. 1992) . Incremental breathing is also seen in gasping during acute cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (Hutchison et al. 2002) . Gasping is typified by brief laryngeal abductor and pump muscle activities followed by long periods of laryngeal adductor activity with apnea (Hutchison et al. 2002) . Subglottic pressure is increased, maintaining airway volume and likely promoting autoresuscitation (Hutchison et al. 2002) .",

Application of acid to the larynx in animals, mimicking chronic aspiration, alters the subsequent response to an applied airway load (see Sect. 47.3.1). During noninvasive ventilation, nonsynchronous delivery of airflow to the upper airway in neural expiration results in laryngeal closure (Rodenstein 2004; Scharf et al. 1978) .

During the unimpeded expiration following a single inspiratory occlusive load, unopposed TA activity can produce laryngeal closure. Thus when no air enters the lung, a compensatory reflex mechanism can prevent expiratory volume loss, maintaining absolute subglottic volume. Lower airway afferent inputs affect glottic size (Bailey and Fregosi 2006) . Stretch receptor discharges, induced by PEEP, decrease expiratory TA activity (Harding 1986) . By contrast increased expiratory glottic adduction follows rapidly adapting receptor stimulation, e.g., with deflation or irritant stimulation secondary to a pneumothorax (Bartlett 1989) , or follows C-fiber stimulation, e.g., with experimental pulmonary edema (Bartlett 1989 ). Direct and indirect stimulation of chest wall muscle afferents can invoke several flow patterns involving glottic closure (Bartlett 1989; Stecenko and Hutchison 1991) .",

            "text": "While pseudoasthma can be fabricated by partial glottic closure (Rodenstein 2004) , matching laryngeal control of flow pattern to maintain optimal subglottic airway volume may explain changes reported with true increased airway resistance. Subglottic inspiratory flow limitation in croup is associated with expiratory flow resistance, probably glottic in origin (Argent et al. 2008) . Increased lower airway resistance in adult asthmatic patients induces a breathing pattern characterized by laryngeal expiratory flow retardation (Collett et al. 1983; Sekizawa et al. 1987) . In adults, resistive loads applied at the mouth also decrease expiratory glottic size (Brancatisano et al. 1985) . This change may occur immediately, suggesting that resistive loading, unlike total occlusive (elastic) loading, produces sudden flow changes that stimulate airway receptors to cause laryngeal adduction (Brancatisano et al. 1985) . Therapy with CPAP reverses the expiratory laryngeal adduction in some asthmatic subjects, suggesting that airway pressure changes may alter the dynamics between stretch receptor and irritant receptor stimulations, thus changing the breathing pattern (Collett et al. 1983) . In normal adults a voluntary deep breath can decrease laryngeal resistance and lower airway resistance (Sekizawa et al. 1987) . By contrast, bronchoconstrictive stimulation in normal adults can result in inspiratory and expiratory glottic narrowing (Higenbottam 1980 ). An increased resistance to inspiratory flow may be advantageous in that more transpulmonary pressure is applied to opening a constricted peripheral airway. If lower airway volume and resistance changes affect laryngeal function, can absence of laryngeal control affect lower airway resistance? Laryngeal bypass during invasive ventilation is associated with atelectasis and with the development of increased lower airway resistance (Hutchison and Bignall 2008) . The latter effect may stiffen the conducting airways and thus stabilize total airway volume but demand increased effort. In summary, the data reflect the importance of laryngeal subglottic volume control as a determinant of lower airway resistance and point to interactions between lower airway afferents and coordinated laryngeal and pump muscle activities in this dynamic process (see also Sect. 47.3.1).",

In normal adult humans, expiratory TA activity is absent during stable NREM, while expiratory PCA activity decreases in NREM and is variable in REM (Kuna et al. 1988 .

In lambs, the increase in ventilation is dependent upon carotid body input -a sudden decrease in that input induces expiratory TA activity (Praud et al. 1992 ). However, animal and human data indicate that the effects of carotid body input vary depending upon central state and the presence/absence of other inputs (de Burgh Daly et al. 1979 ). If animals are vagotomized and paralyzed, direct carotid body stimulation can induce expiratory TA activity, and exposure to hypoxia after airway vagal blockade or intrathoracic vagal section results in laryngeal adduction (Bailey and Fregosi 2006) . In adult humans, the degree of expiratory glottic adduction with hypoxia exceeds that during hypercapnia (England et al. 1982b) . Thus, it is argued that the \"pure\" carotid body reflex response is laryngeal expiratory adduction that will retain airway volume and promote oxygenation. This pure response can be countered by the presence of ventilation which increases airway stretch receptor feedback that results in an overall expiratory laryngeal abduction response. In the author's view, a unifying explanation for the diverse findings with hypoxia is that the effect of carotid body input is to augment the central coordinated output to laryngeal and pump muscles that is selected under different conditions (see Sect. 47.3.1). When central depression exists, protective inputs and/or absence of volume-related inputs produce an apneic response with glottic closure that is augmented by hypoxia. This can be seen in the \"vagal\" preterm infant who is sedated for a surgical procedure. At intubation laryngeal closure and apnea/bradycardia can be triggered. If hypoxemia ensues, the problems are aggravated. When tidal ventilation and airway volume feedback are restored, the impact of any ongoing hypoxemia is to augment breathing. Hering and Breuer found that their volumerelated reflexes were active even with hydrogen breathing. This fits the modern focus on ventilation for resuscitation from asphyxia.",

During spontaneous breathing, the forces driving inspiration are generated by the inspiratory muscles, whereas during mechanical ventilation, the forces are generated by the ventilator or by a combination of the ventilator with spontaneous inspiratory muscle contributions. The inspiratory muscle pressure needs to be sufficient to overcome three major mechanical properties of the respiratory system: elastance (E) (to overcome tissue forces required to change the lung volume (V)), resistance (R) (to overcome resistance to flow (V')), and inertance (I) (for acceleration (V'') of gas volumes). Elastance is often considered in terms of its inverse, the compliance (C). The total pressure (P total ) generated is equal to the sum of the elastic (P el , proportional to volume and 1/compliance), resistive (P res , proportional to flow and resistance), and inertive (P in , proportional to acceleration and inertance) components:",

The outward recoil of the chest wall results from the elastic characteristics of the diaphragm/abdomen and of the rib cage. The outward recoil of the chest wall directly opposes the inward recoil of the lung. Inward recoil is determined by the viscoelastic properties of the lung, including the mechanical properties of the lung tissues, and the collapsing pressure generated at the alveolar air-liquid interface. During spontaneous breathing, the passive respiratory mechanics can be measured using occlusion techniques. Occlusion of the airways at lung volumes above the resting lung volume relaxes the respiratory muscles by stimulating the slowly adapting stretch receptors and the vagally mediated Hering-Breuer inflation reflex. Passive tests assess the mechanical properties of the entire respiratory system. Simultaneous measurement of transpulmonary pressure allows measurement of respiratory system compliance (C rs ) to be partitioned into lung (C L ) and chest wall (C w ) components. Transpulmonary pressure (P tp ) is derived from the difference in pressure at the airway opening (P ao ) and pleural pressure (or elastic recoil pressure, P el ), measured using an esophageal balloon, liquid-filled catheter, or miniature pressure transducer.",

During tidal breathing, multilinear regression is used to determine dynamic respiratory system compliance (C dyn,rs ) and resistance (R rs ). Kano and colleagues showed that consideration of volume dependence is important when using this approach to assess dynamic mechanics during mechanical ventilation. Consideration of volume dependence is important because ventilatory settings may \"push\" the pressure-volume curve onto the flattened upper portion of the curve (Kano et al. 1994 ).

An important consideration during the interpretation of dynamic respiratory mechanics is the concept of frequency dependence. Kano showed that increasing the ventilation rate from 30 to 80 breaths/min in a group of near-term newborn infants increased E rs and R rs by a mean of 8.3 and 17.5 %, respectively (Kano et al. 1994) . Frequency dependence and the mechanical properties of the respiratory system under normal tidal breathing conditions are also determined using forced oscillatory techniques (FOT). These techniques are essentially noninvasive and are especially useful in infants and children as no active subject cooperation is required. The technique involves application of a pressure waveform (forcing function) to the airway opening and measurement of the resultant flow. The measured impedance reflects the complex viscoelastic resistance of the respiratory system (Z rs ). Simultaneous measurement of the transpulmonary pressure and hence chest wall impedance (Z w ) allows determination of the lung impedance (Z L ) by subtraction. The impedance (Z) can be separated into the resistance (R rs ), the impedance component in phase with flow, and reactance (X rs ), representing the impedance components in phase with volume (elastance) and acceleration (inertance).",

This constant-phase tissue component is described by [(G \u2212 jH)/\u03c9\u03b1, where G and H are coefficients for tissue damping and elastance, respectively, \u03c9 is angular frequency, and \u03b1 determines the frequency dependence of the real (pressure change in phase with flow) and imaginary (pressure change in phase with volume) parts of the impedance] (Hantos et al. 1992a ).",

The interrupter technique involves measurement of changes in airway opening pressure after a midexpiratory occlusion, which is used to calculate airway resistance (R aw ). After airway occlusion at mid-expiration, there is a biphasic change in P ao : the immediate rapid rise in P ao represents the resistive pressure drop across the conducting airways and is followed by a secondary slower increase in P ao (often referred to as P dif ) generally attributed to stress recovery in the respiratory tissues (lung and chest wall) and gas redistribution associated with ventilation inhomogeneity (Bates et al. 1988) . A major limitation of this technique is that it requires mechanical ventilation and paralysis to obtain reliable data.",

Consensus between these studies is lacking. While some of the lack of agreement is attributable to technical approaches used by different authors, a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing respiratory mechanics over time can only be answered by strong longitudinal data, which are urgently required. These tests of lung mechanics provide us with essential insight into how tissue properties change with development, and a full understanding of the changes that occur during healthy development is an important step to detect the subsequent effects of disease and response of the individual to therapeutic interventions.

Increased growth of the larger central airways, in relation to peripheral generations, has been described through the first year of life, after which point adult relative proportions are achieved and maintained through further growth (Horsfield et al. 1987) . Disproportionate central and peripheral airway growth, however, is not a consistent finding in the literature (Hislop et al. 1972) . The most rapid period of tracheal growth appears to occur during the first 4 years of life (Wailoo and Emery 1982) . An elevated ratio of peripheral airway resistance to central airway resistance (and its contribution to total airway resistance) in young children compared to adults was originally proposed by Hogg et al. (1970) , based on retrograde catheter measurements. The authors described relatively little change in the contribution of the central airways (those proximal to the 12th-15th airway generations) to conductance with age but marked increase in peripheral airway conductance from the age of 5 years of age. These changes were attributed to altered linear dimensions of the peripheral airways, based on morphometric data. The ratio of central to peripheral resistance can also be examined noninvasively by comparing measured forced expiratory flows (FEF) breathing air to FEF measured breathing a less-dense gas mixture of 80 % helium/20 % oxygen (heliox). FEF measured breathing heliox is typically higher than during air breathing (e.g., 1.2-1.6 times at 50 % FVC). In older subjects with peripheral airway disease, this pattern is lost with ratios approaching parity (Cooper et al. 1983; Dosman et al. 1975) . Density dependence data during infancy, in comparison to values reported in later life, appear to challenge the findings of Hogg et al. (1970) . Davis et al. examined the changes in density dependence through the first 2 years of life (Davis et al. 1999) . FEF 30-40 % higher were measured with heliox: although no relationship existed between density dependence and age, length, or FVC in the first 2 years of life (in keeping with Hogg et al. (1970) ), the values obtained were similar to those reported across 16 other studies in older children ranging from school age to adulthood (summarized in Table 2 of the original manuscript (Davis et al. 1999) ). These equivalent cross-sectional density dependence values suggest that there is no difference in the convective accelerative and turbulent pressure loss with age, supporting the notion that the ratio of resistance of the peripheral to the central airways is similar in infants, older children, and adults.",

Both resistance and height are plotted as natural log values but are labeled with absolute numbers for clarity examined (Gerhardt et al. 1987a ). This increase occurred at a slower rate than the increase in FRC, which led to a rapid drop in specific conductance ( Fig. 4.8b ). This rapid decrease in specific airway resistance or conductance through early life has been described previously (Doershuk et al. 1974; Stocks and Godfrey 1977) . Tepper et al. measured maximal FEF at FRC, from partial expiratory flow-volume curves and corrected for changes in lung volume: they reported higher flows in the neonatal range which decreased to a steady value through the 2nd year of life, similar to those reported elsewhere in older children (Tepper et al. 1986a) . Differential increases in anatomic dead space volume (twofold), compared to FRC (threefold), have also been shown in the pediatric population (Wood et al. 1971) . ",

            "text": "Rapid postnatal increases in lung volume are reported widely. FRC increases by a magnitude of 40 times (from 80 mL in infants to 3,000 mL in adults) (Dunnill 1982) and over ten times in total lung weight (Polgar and Weng 1979) . The rapid growth of the distal lung, in comparison to relatively steady changes in airway dimensions, is a major feature of respiratory system development beyond birth. After the appearance of primitive saccules at approximately 28 weeks gestation, mature alveoli with secondary septa appear from 34 weeks gestation onwards. Alveolar multiplication was initially thought to cease at around 2 years of age (Thurlbeck 1982) . More recent estimates indicate that increase in alveolar number continues until at least 8 years (Dunnill 1982) . Recent advanced imaging studies using hyperpolarized helium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide evidence of ongoing alveolar multiplication in adolescence (Narayanan et al. 2012) . Increase in alveolar size (expansion) is also evident during infancy and childhood, with recent epidemiology studies suggesting lung size increases into early adulthood, when chest wall development is complete (Quanjer et al. 1989; Reid 1977 ). Based on cross-sectional studies, specific lung compliance falls during early infancy before remaining relatively constant from the early preschool years. Tepper et al., based on measurements of compliance from the linear portion of the static pressure-volume (PV) curve in almost 50 infants, described an increase in lung compliance over the age range studied, but decreasing specific lung compliance with increasing body length in the first 2 years of life (Tepper et al. 2001 ). Gerhardt et al. examined similar changes in 40 infants and children over the first 5 years of life. Lung compliance increased markedly (by ~20-25-fold) over the weight range examined (Fig. 4 .8a) but in proportion to FRC, resulting in a constant-specific compliance over the first 5 years of life. The same pattern of findings was reported in 63 children aged 2-7 years (Greenough et al. 1986 ). This initial rapid period of alveolar growth is also supported by evidence from measurements using the interrupter technique and FOT. Lanteri and Sly showed a biphasic change in P dif with age: P dif was highest in young infants, falling rapidly over the first 12 months, before increasing again after approximately 5 years of age (Lanteri and Sly 1993) . Hall and colleagues, using LFOT measures of tissue mechanics derived by fitting data to the constant-phase model, showed that both tissue parameters G and H decreased in a quasihyperbolic manner with increasing length between 7 weeks and 2 years of age (Hall et al. 2000) . The difference in the pattern of change in G and H compared to the change in R aw with increasing length is further evidence of dysanapsis: tissue mechanical properties change more rapidly than airway mechanics over the first 2 years of life ( Fig. 4.9 ).",

            "text": "The chest wall of the neonate and infant, and to a lesser extent the growing child, is especially compliant compared to the compliance of the chest wall in the adult subject. A highly compliant chest wall in infancy results in less opposition to the tendency of the lung to collapse, promoting a low residual lung volume and also distortion of the chest wall, resulting in a loss of volume during inspiration. The disproportionately high compliance of the chest wall compared to the compliances of the lung means that the compliance of the respiratory system (C rs ) is approximately equal to the compliance of the lung (C L ) during childhood, especially in neonates and infancy (Davis et al. 1988; Gerhardt et al. 1987a) . Several active (dynamic) mechanisms of respiratory mechanics serve to partially compensate for the instability in FRC associated with a compliant chest wall and tendency for small airway closure during tidal breathing. Infants acutely increase their end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and maintain it above resting lung volume by modulating (abbreviating) their expiratory time (Mortola and Saetta 1987) ( Fig. 4.10a ). In addition, they reduce expiratory flow through post-inspiratory activity of the diaphragm and inspiratory chest wall muscles (Kosch and Stark 1984) (Fig. 4 .10b) (Lopes et al. 1981) , stiffening the chest wall and by increasing laryngeal resistance (\u00b1 glottic closure) briefly (Kosch et al. 1988) . Such dynamic modifications of respiratory mechanics occur via neural (vagal) receptor-mediated reflexes. Restriction of lung function measurement to periods of quiet sleep is necessary to reduce the variability in measurements resulting from such dynamic processes (Henschen and Stocks 1999) .",

In this cohort, the ratio of chest wall to lung compliance fell from a mean (SD) of 2.9 (1.1) to 1.3 (0.4) (p < 0.005). Chest wall to lung compliance ratios are even higher in preterm infants (Gerhardt and Bancalari 1980) .

Stiffening of the chest wall likely also explains the increase in P dif in children after age of 5 years observed by Lanteri and Sly (Lanteri and Sly 1993) . FRC as a proportion of total lung capacity (TLC) increases with age through childhood, in the majority (Engstrom et al. 1956; Mansell et al. 1977; Weng and Levison 1969) , but not all (Schrader et al. 1988 ), studies to date. Residual volume (RV), as a proportion of TLC, also increases with age through childhood (Merkus et al. 1993) , while closing capacity (measured using single-breath nitrogen washout) decreases significantly with age, as a proportion of TLC, converging towards RV (Mansell et al. 1977) . This increased RV/ TLC ratio suggests that increased stiffness of the chest wall is not entirely compensated for by increase in expiratory muscle force over time (Schrader et al. 1988 ). The study by Merkus et al. also highlighted the need to use TLC as a measure of lung growth and not FVC, due to the fact that an increasing RV/TLC with age led to errors in maximal expired flows due to measurement at progressively higher lung volumes (Merkus et al. 1993 ).",

This is compared to the passive expiratory time constant (slope of the dotted line) measured after an end-inspiratory occlusion. The difference between the two slopes is generated due to active use of the respiratory muscles during expiration (\"braking\").

Using the LFOT, impedance measurements in na\u00efve (surfactant-deficient) newborn preterm lambs showed that respiratory system resistance (R rs ) and reactance (X rs ) are markedly frequency dependent (Pillow et al. 2001a) . Respiratory system resistance in the preterm infant is also dominated by the resistive properties of the tissues, contrasting sharply with the predominant airway contribution to respiratory system resistance in later life (Pillow et al. 2005) . Although compliance is also low (increased elastance), the tissue resistance is disproportionately greater, resulting in mechanical uncoupling of the parenchyma and increased hysteresivity (ratio of tissue resistance to tissue elastance) (Pillow et al. 2001a (Pillow et al. , 2005 . Increased surfactant pool size (Pillow et al. 2004a ) and lung volume recruitment (Pillow et al. 2004b ) both enhance mechanical coupling of the tissues, evident as a lowering of the hysteresivity ratio in the lung. Increased contribution of the tissues to respiratory system mechanics, and the associated increased frequency dependence, results in elevation of the resonance frequency of the lung (Pillow et al. 2001a) .

Like antenatal steroids, postnatal steroids also increase respiratory system compliance (Durand et al. 1995) . Low-dose and high-dose postnatal dexamethasone for CLD achieve a similar increase in C rs suggesting equal effectiveness for improvement of lung volume (McEvoy et al. 2004) . Early postnatal dexamethasone may be more effective than late dexamethasone in achieving lower R aw /R rs and higher specific conductance (sG aw ) (Merz et al. 1999; Vento et al. 2004) , which may indicate a degree of fixed change in the airway walls in infants receiving delayed glucocorticoid treatment.",

Effective delivery of surfactant to the lung thus benefits from a transient increase in the inspiratory time and potentially brief increase in the delta P (peak inspiratory pressure-positive endexpiratory pressure) to overcome the increase resistance resulting from the fluid bolus. Treatment with exogenous surfactant (da Silva et al. 1994) or increases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during recruitment from atelectasis increases lung volume: (Dimitriou et al. 1999 ) lung volume increases by 61 \u00b1 39 % within a median of 4 min after surfactant administration, with altered distribution of lung volume towards the dorsal rather than ventral compartment. The increase in lung volume after surfactant or volume recruitment maneuvers increases maximal compliance of the respiratory system, with higher tidal volumes achieved at lower pressures than required prior to treatment (Miedema et al. 2011a; McEvoy et al. 2010) . Importantly, the increase in compliance also impacts on the time constant (\u03c4 = R rs \u00d7 C rs ) of the respiratory system. Changes in the inspiratory and expiratory time constants need to be monitored as they necessitate adjustment of the inspiratory and expiratory times and influence the maximal frequency that can be used during ventilation with passive expiration.",

            "text": "Compared to treatment of RDS with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), a small clinical trial showed that infants treated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) have early and sustained improvement in pulmonary mechanics and higher dynamic respiratory compliance (Vento et al. 2005) . The improvement in pulmonary mechanics in patients treated with HFOV is likely associated with enhanced lung volume recruitment. The neonatal lung with RDS exhibits hysteresis (Miedema et al. 2011b) . Hence lung recruitment maneuvers that aim to recruit the lung and subsequently ventilate it on the most compliant part of the deflation pressure volume curve can achieve effective ventilation with minimum pressure and volume cost of ventilation. Importantly, recruitment of the lung by increasing mean distending pressure during HFOV is also associated with changes in compliance and the time constant for volume delivery during HFOV (Pillow 2012) . Consequently, volume delivery can vary substantially over the time course of an HFOV volume recruitment maneuver (Miedema et al. 2012 ) and potentially result in rapid fluxes of the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide. The effect of compliance on volume delivery during HFOV is more evident at lower frequencies (Pillow 2012; Pillow et al. 2001b ). The development of HFOV ventilators that incorporate volume guarantee during HFOV will provide protection from such rapid changes in ventilation during HFOV. Infants with RDS often have their clinical course complicated by the persistence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which presents as a leftright shunt. Ligation of a PDA (left-right shunt) increased dynamic compliance by 77 % in 16 newborn infants measured before and after ligation, but did not influence dynamic R rs or mean airway pressure (Szymankiewicz et al. 2004a ).",

Impaired compliance after MAS is responsive to standard surfactant instillation (Sun et al. 1993) . Larger volume (15 mL/kg) surfactant lung lavage is an emerging treatment for MAS: following surfactant lung lavage, dynamic compliance approximately doubled, and airway resistance nearly halved in a group of MAS infants on mechanical ventilation (Szymankiewicz et al. 2004b ). These changes in dynamic respiratory mechanics were associated with a decrease in mean (SD) airway pressure from 12.4 \u00b1 3.6 to 5.4 \u00b1 2.1 cm H 2 O within 48 h after surfactant lung lavage. Meconium appears to have a differential effect on hyperreactivity of the airways and the lung tissue. Whereas tracheal smooth muscle reactivity increases with increasing meconium concentration in response to histamine and acetylcholine, a negative correlation was observed in the lung tissue (Mokry et al. 2007 ). Airway hyperresponsiveness 2 weeks after birth (approximately 5 days after cessation of ECMO) is responsive to bronchodilator treatment (Koumbourlis et al. 1995) as evidenced by percent change in MEF 25 and the MEF 25 /FVC ratio. Airway hyperreactivity after MAS is also reduced by budesonide (Mokry et al. 2007 ).",

A prospective evaluation of lung function in infants with PPHN treated with/without iNO was reported by Dobyns and colleagues (1999) : compared to healthy control infants of the same age, there were no differences in lung volume or passive respiratory mechanics for infants with PPHN, nor was there any effect of iNO on later pulmonary function in the PPHN group.

Conversely, and perhaps surprisingly, given the usual association of CDH with pulmonary hypoplasia in at least one lung, Spoel noted that measured values of functional residual capacity were relatively high (47 % fell above the normal range) (Spoel et al. 2012b ). As expected, mean Z-score for FEV 1 and FVC was negatively influenced by the presence of chronic lung disease, the duration of ventilation, and ECMO support (Spoel et al. 2012a) . Patients with CDH develop hyperinflation, with elevated plethysmographic FRC at 1 year (Hofhuis et al. 2011 ) that is still evident at 8-12 years (Spoel et al. 2012a; Hamutcu et al. 2004; Majaesic et al. 2007 ). Spoel showed that greater impairment was evident in infants with CDH who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Spoel et al. 2012b ). However, poorer outcome in ECMOtreated CDH may reflect the initial severity of disease rather than ECMO: Beardsmore showed that ECMO per se did not worsen respiratory function at 1 year of age compared to conventionally ventilated controls (Beardsmore et al. 2000) .",

Factors that independently influence the tidal flow-volume-derived indices include variations in disease severity, degree of alteration to airway and lung mechanics, and also the requirement for oxygen supplementation ). There are, nonetheless, quantitative differences in tidal breathing function measured in BPD infants when compared with measurements obtained from healthy term and preterm controls. BPD infants are consistently more tachypneic than their healthy counterparts ), but differences in other lung function variables are less consistent. Tidal volume (V T ) is either less than (Paetow et al. 1999) or similar to (Patzak et al. 1999; Schmalisch et al. 2003) values obtained in healthy infants: V T relative to healthy infants may also decrease with advancing postnatal age (Tepper et al. 1986b) , likely reflecting the altered maturational progression in lung structure and function. BPD infants have increased minute ventilation (MV). Increased MV is primarily due to increased respiratory rate rather than increases in V, in part reflecting increased dead space ventilation. Infants with BPD have an increased work of breathing. Within the tidal flow-volume loop, increased work of breathing is evident from linear or concave expiratory limb morphology. BPD infants also have a less variable shape to the tidal flow-volume waveform, indicating that they are functioning near their maximum respiratory capability with minimal reserve capacity to adapt to changes in intrinsic (e.g., airway obstruction, infection, or aspiration) or extrinsic (e.g., cold stress) environment . Tidal flow indices are difficult to interpret in part due to opposing effects of neurorespiratory control and lung mechanics on the morphology of the tidal flow waveform. Whereas BPD infants have higher respiratory drive (quantified from the mean inspiratory flow: V T /t I where t I is inspiratory time), the ratio of the time to peak expiratory flow relative to expiratory time (t PTEF :t E ) after methacholine-induced airway obstruction can either increase or decrease (Clarke et al. 1994) . Normal fluctuations in V T , t I , and MV seen in healthy infants in response to alternate hypoxic-normoxic breath testing are not evident in BPD infants, indicating reduced chemoreceptor sensitivity to hypoxic stimulus (Calder et al. 1994) .",

Using the single occlusion technique, Hjalmarson and Sandberg showed that infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (born at mean 25 weeks GA) had increased specific conductance and decreased specific compliance (sC rs ) compared to healthy preterm infants (born at mean 29 weeks gestation) (Hjalmarson and Sandberg 2005) . There were no differences in lung mechanics between the healthy preterm infants and those with mild or moderate bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The data published by Tortorolo et al. indicate a similar trend towards lower C rs at day 7 in infants who later went on to develop mild BPD and to a greater extent in severe BPD (Tortorolo et al. 2002) . Their results contrast with the findings by Shao and colleagues in infants of similar gestations that infants with BPD had decreased C rs (10.8 vs 16.0 mL/kPa/Kg), but no difference in specific sC rs (0.69 vs 0.75 mL/kPa/kg) or R rs (6.6 vs 7.3 cm H 2 O/mL/s) compared to non-ventilated preterm infants. Infants with BPD do not show an improvement in airway resistance (R aw , measured by plethysmography) over a 4-month period (Shao et al. 1998) .",

Reduced expiratory flows are indicative of abnormal structural and functional development of the airways (Fig. 4.12) . Serial lung function measurements in infants with both BPD and \"healthy\" unsedated preterm infants indicate a decline over the first year of life, suggesting that factors other than BPD may contribute to abnormal airway function in preterm infants (Hoo et al. 2002b) . Raised volume rapid thoracic compression (RVRTC) measurements show similar mild-moderately severe airflow obstruction. However the predominance of airflow obstruction primarily at low lung volumes indicates the pathology is more likely to involve the small peripheral rather than larger central airways (Lum et al. 2006b ). Concurrent increased residual volume (RV), FRC, and RV/ TLC (total lung capacity) ratios were more marked in infants with recurrent wheeze, indicative of a degree of hyperinflation and gas trapping. Intermediate values (between healthy controls and wheezy BPD infants) were observed for RV, FRC, and RV/TLC in non-wheezy preterm infants (Robin et al. 2004) , likely reflective of abnormal airway growth or the effects of preterm delivery. Forced deflation from FRC showed that preterm infants with developing BPD have severe lower airway obstruction as early as 3-4 weeks postnatal age. Increased flows and FVC following bronchodilation indicate that reopening of obstructed airways is achieved with bronchodilators (Motoyama et al. 1987) .",

The meta-analysis showed that just being born preterm decreased FEV 1 compared to term-born controls, with further decrements in FEV 1 evident for the BPD 28 and BPD 36 week groups. The mean differences (95 % CI) for % FEV 1 compared with term-born controls were \u22127.2 % (\u22128.7 %, \u22125.6 %) for preterm group without BPD and \u221216.2 % (\u221219.9 to \u221212.4 %) and \u221218.9 % (\u221221.1 to \u221216.7 %) for the BPD 28 and BPD 36 groups, respectively. Including data from preterm studies not including a control group resulted in a pooled % FEV 1 estimate of 91.0 % (88.8-93.1 %) for preterm infants without BPD, 83.7 % (80.2-87.2 %) for BPD 28 , and 79.1 % (76.9-81.3 %) for BPD 36 , respectively. Of interest, the authors noted that %FEV 1 for BPD 28 has improved over the years. BPD survivors also have lower forced expiratory flows: 70 % of children with BPD had maximal flow at functional respiratory capacity (V max FRC) below 40 % of the predicted value (Baraldi et al. 1997a) . Forced expiratory flow at 25 % of forced vital capacity was reduced in young adolescents born prematurely, regardless of prior BPD or level of respiratory support (Anand et al. 2003) . Of concern, Doyle and colleagues showed that airflow limitation worsened between 8 and 18 years ). Together, these data suggest that the preterm infant population is at risk of developing chronic obstructive disease and should receive long-term respiratory follow-up (Baraldi and Filippone 2007a; Filippone et al. 2003; Lum et al. 2011) . Airway obstruction is accompanied by impaired diffusing capacity in children and adults born prematurely (Hakulinen et al. 1996; Vrijlandt et al. 2006) . Similar findings in infants and toddlers with BPD in the face of normal alveolar volumes indicate parenchymal disease and impaired alveolarization (Balinotti et al. 2010 ).",

Fifty-six percent of children in the Epicure study born at 25 weeks PMA or less had abnormal baseline spirometry at 11 years of age, with 27 % showing a positive bronchodilator response: more marked responses were evident in the infants with prior BPD (Fawke et al. 2010) . Less than half of the Epicure study children with abnormal lung function at 11 years were receiving treatment, suggesting more targeted respiratory follow-up is warranted.

Pediatric ILD comprises a heterogeneous group of rare disorders with considerable mortality (Clement 2004; Fan et al. 2004; Fan and Langston 1993) . Chronic ILD in immune-competent children has been defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and/or diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs, abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFT) with evidence of restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange, and persistence of any of these findings for >3 months (Clement 2004) . PFT, in children over 6 years, show a reduced forced VC (FVC) and FEV 1 and a normal or elevated FEV 1 / FVC ratio (Fan et al. 2004) (Fig. 4.13) . The not be reliable. Reasons for variability include the highly frequency-dependent nature of respiratory mechanics, rapidly changing nature of respiratory disease, maturation and the acute effects of antenatal exposures, and postnatal treatments and interventions. \u2022 RDS is typically characterized by low lung volumes, reduced lung compliance, and elevated tissue resistance. \u2022 Meconium aspiration is characterized by both increased resistance and decreased compliance. Both resistance and compliance are improved by surfactant lavage. MAS may be complicated by airway hyperreactivity and gas trapping beyond infancy. \u2022 Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have impaired airway function at 1 year of age, with evidence of continuing deterioration throughout childhood. Worse lung function is likely associated with initial severity of disease and intensity/duration of mechanical ventilation. \u2022 BPD infants are typically more tachypneic than their healthy counterparts and have increased work of breathing. Airway walls are more compliant and may be prone to collapse. While lung function outcomes for infants with BPD have improved over the last one to two decades, airflow limitation remains an issue for long-term respiratory function after bronchopulmonary dysplasia and may worsen with time. Diffusing capacity is also impaired in children and adults born prematurely and may reflect parenchymal disease and impaired alveolarization. \u2022 Although patients receiving ECMO generally have worse lung function than those treated without ECMO, this is likely due to the initial severity of lung disease and duration of mechanical ventilation rather than an effect of ECMO on long-term lung function per se.",

            "text": "ALI/ARDS are characterized by an acute onset of respiratory failure, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on the chest radiograph, the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension, and a ratio of PaO 2 to FiO 2 (P/F) of less than 200 mmHg (regardless of PEEP). Acute lung injury (ALI) is a subset of ARDS with less severe impairment in oxygenation (P/F <300) (Bernard et al. 1994) . SpO 2 /FiO 2 (S/F) may be a good noninvasive surrogate marker for P/F in children: S/F ratios of 263 and 201 have been shown to correspond to P/F ratios of 300 and 200, respectively, the ARDS cutoff of 201 having 84 % sensitivity and 78 % specificity (Bach and Bianchi 2003) . Decreased C L was associated to these items (Ware and Matthay 2000) . ALI/ARDS are rare diseases in children and have mortality rates ranging from 18 to 75 % (Flori et al. 2005; Zimmerman et al. 2009 ). Mechanical ventilation represents the main therapeutic support to maintain acceptable pulmonary gas exchange while treating the underlying disease. A \"lung protective ventilation strategy\" with limitation in airway P and tidal volume (VT) (The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network 2000) led, in adult studies, to a reduction in mortality at day 28 and a reduction in hospital mortality (Petrucci and Iacovelli 2007; The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network 2000) . No published data exist for children, but practice in PICU is derived from adult patients (Khemani and Newth 2010 The most characteristic alteration in acute ARDS lung is marked fall in C L caused by loss of surfactant function, atelectatic lung regions, accumulation of interstitial/alveolar plasma leakage (Ware and Matthay 2000) , and an associated fall in FRC (Hammer 2001) . In adults, the decrease in C L was shown to be more important in early ARDS from pulmonary origin (and associated with normal chest wall C (C cw )) than in extrapulmonary ARDS. The latter was associated with low C cw (Gattinoni et al. 1998) . A decrease in respiratory system compliance (C rs ) and a proportional decrease in TLC, FVC, and FRC were also observed in children during the acute phase of ARDS (Hammer et al. 1998; Newth et al. 1997) . ALI/ARDS may resolve completely in some patients, while in others it progresses to fibrosing alveolitis with persistent hypoxemia and a further decrease in C L (Ware and Matthay 2000) . Fibroproliferation occurs early in ARDS, and its extent may be predictive of outcome (Marshall et al. 2000) . The recovery phase is characterized by the gradual resolution of hypoxemia and improved C L (Ware and Matthay 2000) . Pharmacologic interventions, such as corticosteroids, starting in the late course of ARDS may reduce fibrosis and may have a beneficial impact on pulmonary outcome (Tang et al. 2009 ).",

Obese children have more respiratory symptoms than their normal-weighted peers, and respiratory-related disorders increase with increasing weight. The prevalence of asthma has also increased in children. Both obesity and asthma have their beginnings in early childhood (Litonjua and Gold 2008) . Wheezing, asthma, and obesity seem to be associated (Guerra et al. 2002; Hancox et al. 2005; Schachter et al. 2001 ). However, three large studies (Bibi et al. 2004; Schachter et al. 2003; Wickens et al. 2005) showed a clear increase in symptoms of asthma in association with obesity but not more frequent airway hyperresponsiveness in obese children (Deane and Thomson 2006) . C CW is reduced in obesity, because of increased adiposity in the abdomen and around the thoracic cage that restricts rib expansion and because the decreased total thoracic and pulmonary V may pull the chest wall below its resting level to a flatten portion of its P/V curve. C CW decrease correlated with CO 2 retention, independent of body fat, and with shortness of breath (Subramaian and Strohl 2004) . C L may be decreased in some obese individuals because of a large pulmonary blood volume and intrinsic alterations of elastic characteristics of lung tissues (Subramaian and Strohl 2004) .",

Asthma severity describes the underlying disease state as evaluated by FEV 1 and daytime and nighttime symptoms, all measured before treatment. Patients with moderate and severe persistent asthma are said to have values of 60-80 % and <60 % of predicted, respectively. FEV 1 may not be the best measure of severity in childhood asthma because most asthmatic children have FEV 1 values in the normal range independent of disease severity when clinically stable (Spahn et al. 2004) . Diminished FEV 1 values in school-age children should identify children at risk of fixed airway obstruction at adulthood (Rasmussen et al. 2002) . For children, FEV1/FVC appears to be a more sensitive measure of severity in the impairment domain (NHLBI 2007) A concave shape on the F/V curve may be observed as a result of small airway obstruction (Pellegrino et al. 2005) . It may be observed in asthmatic children with a normal FEV 1 , together with a significant improvement following administration of a bronchodilator (Basek et al. 2005; Brand and Roorda 2003) . A concave shape is associated with impairment in the FEF between 25 and 75 % of FVC (FEF 25-75 % ) that is believed to measure peripheral airway obstruction. FEF 25-75 % is among the first parameters to be abnormal in pediatric asthma and often the most significantly impaired of all spirometric measures (Paull et al. 2005; Spahn and Chipps 2006) . A FEF 25-75 % \u226465 % is well correlated with bronchodilator responsiveness in asthmatic children with normal FEV 1 and may suggest suboptimal asthma control (Simon et al. 2010) .",

Hence, at an early stage of the disease, an isolated increase in lung V may be the sole functional abnormality (Landau et al. 1979; Paton 2000) . In asthmatic children, FRC increases with severity of asthma (Greenough et al. 1987) and is more elevated in symptomatic children ). Trapped air is associated with hypoxemia (Wolf et al. 1983 ) but correlates poorly with F limitation and may be lacking in patients with severe asthma (Basek et al. 2005; Desmond et al. 1986 ). In preschool children with asthma, a 6-week inhaled corticosteroid therapy is associated with reduced hyperinflation as indicated by lower FRC helium . Bronchodilators were shown to decrease helium FRC in 80 % of children aged 2-7 years, and the decrease was correlated to baseline FRC. Some children exhibited an increase in FRC after bronchodilation when baseline value was low (Greenough et al. 1989) .",

Using FOT, increased R of the respiratory system at 5 Hz has been reported in asymptomatic asthmatic preschool children as compared with healthy subjects in some studies (Nielsen and Bisgaard 2001) . Plethysmographic specific R aw (sR aw ), product of R aw , and plethysmographic thoracic gas volume (TGV) may be altered by both hyperinflation and decreased airway diameter. In preschool children, it was shown to be increased in children with a history of wheeze (Lowe et al. 2002) ; it was able to identify responses to bronchodilators (Nielsen and Bisgaard 2001) and inhaled steroids (Nielsen and Bisgaard 2000) . sR aw was more strongly related to FEF after 50 % of FVC has been exhaled (FEF 50 % ) than to FEV 1 and could be used in preschool children to predict mild airflow limitation (Mahut et al. 2009 ).

In more advanced disease, the destruction of lung tissue leads to decreased C that parallels the decline in FEV 1 (Hart et al. 2002) .

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (defined as the need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days after birth) accounts for the vast majority of cases of CLD. What is now considered the \"old\" BPD was originally described in slightly preterm newborns who had been exposed to aggressive mechanical ventilation and high concentrations of inspired oxygen. Diffuse airway damage, smooth muscle hypertrophy, neutrophilic inflammation, and parenchymal fibrosis reflected extensive disruption of relatively immature lung structures. The \"new\" form of BPD is interpreted as a developmental disorder: despite being delivered several weeks before alveolarization begins, these infants often have only mild respiratory distress syndrome at birth, but lung development is affected with interruption of alveolarization at a very early stage with subsequent alveolar-capillary hypoplasia (Baraldi and Filippone 2007b ). Most of the information on long-term lung function in survivors of BPD refers to patients who had the condition before surfactant treatment was available (\"old\" form of BPD).",

Lung mechanics measurement that reflects the severity of neonatal disease (i.e., C rs at 10-20 days) has been shown to correlate with subsequent reduction in lung function in 2-year-old BDP (Baraldi et al. 1997b; Bhandari and Panitch 2006) .",

The rib cage is neither stabilized nor expanded during inspiration. Over a period of time, the retraction of the rib cage has a detrimental effect on alveolar development. In type 1 SMA, with disease beginning before birth, pulmonary hypoplasia has been described (Cunningham and Stocks 1978) . The best parameter to monitor respiratory muscle strength in children with SMA over 6 years is FVC (% predicted) (Manzur et al. 2003) . In SMA, lung V (% predicted) decreases with age, with a greater VC decrease in type 2 than in type 3 SMA. A decline in VC from 87 to 73 % was shown to occur in type 3 SMA from 12 to 18 years (Souchon et al. 1996) . The FVC may therefore be normal or near normal in stronger ambulant type 3 SMA (Samaha et al. 1994) . In type 2 SMA, FVC is more severely impaired and was shown to decline from 55 % predicted to 37 %, from 10 to 16 years, with a yearly average decline by 2-5 % between 7 and 15 years of age (Barois et al. 2005; Herridge et al. 2003; Souchon et al. 1996) .

Therefore PEmax < PImax indicates prevailing expiratory muscle weakness, a characteristic for children with type 2 and 3 SMA . Recurrent chest infections may therefore occur early in SMA children due to a predominance of expiratory muscle weakness with insufficient cough and retention of airway secretions. In patients with muscular dystrophies, PEmax >45 cm H 2 O has been found to be necessary for an effective cough (Mellies and Dohna-Schwake 2005; Mellies et al. 2001; Szeinberg et al. 1988) . Assessment tools to measure the different components of cough include also inspiratory VC (IVC) and the peak expiratory flow or peak cough flow (PCF). Expiratory muscle weakness is often associated with a decrease in PCF and ERV. The effect of coughing can be visualized on the maximum expiratory F/V curve in healthy subjects as a transient F exceeding the maximum achieved during forced expiration. The absence of such supramaximal F transients during coughing presumably results in impaired clearance of airway secretions and is associated with more severe expiratory muscle weakness (American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society 2002; Polkey et al. 1998) . Patients who could not generate peak F transients had significantly reduced PEF, FVC, and PEmax values \u226445 cm H 2 O (Szeinberg et al. 1988) .",

In adults with NMD, PCF below 160-200 L/min is associated with insufficient clearance of airway secretions (Bach and Saporito 1996) . PCF (below 160 L/) and IVC <1.1 L seem also to be able to identify children with NMD at high risk for severe chest infections (Dohna-Schwake et al. 2006) . Baseline PCF measurements above 160 L/ min, however, do not guarantee adequate airway clearance, because respiratory muscle function can deteriorate during respiratory infections (Labanowski et al. 1996) . For this reason a peak cough expiratory flow rate of 270 L/min has been used to identify patients who would benefit from assisted cough techniques (Finder et al. 2004; Laroche et al. 1988) . In DMD, the likelihood of having a PCF value <270 L/min has been shown to rise significantly when FVC is < 2.1 L (Gauld and Boynton 2005) .",

Airflow limitation is a functional consequence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis, emphysema), cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis. Airflow limitation is also observed in bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). An obstructive defect is defined by a reduced FEV 1 / VC ratio. Severity of lung function impairment is based on FEV 1 % of predicted (FEV 1 < 50 % corresponding to severe impairment). Airflow obstruction (AFO) is often reversible in asthma with improvement in FEV 1 and/or FVC \u226512 % of baseline ( Fig. 4.15) . AFO in small airways is suspected from a concave shape on the Fig. 4.15 In cystic fibrosis, as the airway disease becomes more advanced and/or more central airways become involved, FEV 1 will be reduced out of proportion to the reduction in vital capacity (VC) and an obstructive ventilatory defect be observed with a reduced FEV 1 /VC ratio. A FEV 1 < 50 % predicted corresponds to severe impairement of lung function expiratory F/V curve. AFO in small airways is associated with lung hyperinflation. In children with asthma an isolated increase in lung volume may be the sole functional abnormality. Hyperinflation is one of the earliest features of CF. \u2022 Decrease in VC is closely linked to weakness of respiratory muscles and disease progression. VC reflects the strength of both inspiratory and expiratory muscles, but it can be reduced by other factors than muscle weakness (as decreased C L and C CW ). A fall of 30 % or more in the supine compared with the erect posture is associated with severe diaphragmatic weakness. VC below 40 % predicts nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation, and VC <25 % or <1 L, in Duchenne patients, is strongly associated with respiratory failure. In mild respiratory muscle weakness, VC is less sensitive than maximum respiratory pressures (PImax, PEmax, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)).",
