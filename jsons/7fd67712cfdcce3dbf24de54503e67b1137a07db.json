These viruses are highly pathogenic and cause Ebola virus disease (EVD), previously referred to as Ebola hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates up to 90% (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011; Feldmann and Kiley, 1999) . During 2014 Africa experienced the largest EBOV outbreak in history that resulted in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths (Coltart et al., 2017) . Alarmingly, the most recent EBOV-Kivu outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a reported 3,224 confirmed and probable cases of EVD and 2,152 deaths as of October 16, 2019 and does not currently show signs of abating (https://www.who.int/csr/don/02-may-2019-ebola-drc/en/). Currently, there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat EVD; this fact combined with these unprecedented outbreaks in recent years underscores the urgent need to develop a wide variety of effective treatment strategies.",

            "text": "The current armamentarium of treatment options against EBOV primarily consists of small molecules and immunotherapeutics (Edwards and Basler, 2019; King et al., 2019) . Of the reported small molecules that demonstrate anti-EBOV activity, the nucleoside analogs BXC4430, GS-5734, and Favipriravir have shown anti-EBOV activity in in vivo infection models (Bixler et al., 2018; Warren et al., 2014 Warren et al., , 2016 . Similarly, numerous reports have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are effective at inhibiting infection (Brannan et al., 2019; Furuyama et al., 2016; Howell et al., 2017; King et al., 2019; Marzi et al., 2012; Pettitt et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2012; Audet et al., 2014) . These MAbs target the EBOV glycoprotein (GP), which acts as an attachment factor, binding the host receptor Neimann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and mediating viral-host cell membrane fusion within the endosomal compartment (Davey et al., 2017; Carette et al., 2011; Cote et al., 2011; Hunt et al., 2012) . Prior to receptor engagement, GP is cleaved by host cathepsins (Cat) B and L (Chandran et al., 2005; Schornberg et al., 2006) . Cleavage of GP by CatB is required for GP-NPC1 binding and subsequent endosomal fusion (Miller et al., 2012) . As a result, targeting GP endosomal processing and receptor binding can serve as an effective method of EBOV inhibition. Indeed, inhibitors of CatB/L or blockade of GP-NPC1 binding have shown efficacy against EBOV infection (Carette et al., 2011; Chandran et al., 2005; Elshabrawy et al., 2014; Herbert et al., 2015; Schornberg et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs, also called host defense peptides) serve as an essential component of the innate immune system, in part, owing to their pleiotropic functions in microbial killing, inflammation, and wound healing (Nakatsuji and Gallo, 2012) . The two major AMP families in mammalian cells are the defensins and the cationic cathelicidin peptides Ganz, 2002a, 2002b; Zanetti et al., 1995) . Although there are multiple defensin genes, there is only one known cathelicidin gene in humans (Lehrer and Ganz, 2002a; Sorensen et al., 1997) . The human cathelicidin, hCAP-18, is abundantly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and epithelial cells of skin and mucosal membranes (Agerberth et al., 2000; Sorensen et al., 1997) . hCAP-18 is stored as an inactive precursor and upon stimulation is processed to generate the active peptide LL-37 (Sorensen et al., 2001) . Interestingly, besides its broad anti-bacterial property, LL-37 can also inhibit several viruses, including Influenza A virus, human rhinovirus, human adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (Bergman et al., 2007; Currie et al., 2013; Uchio et al., 2013; Sousa et al., 2017) . Recently, it has been demonstrated that LL-37-derived AMPs inhibit Zika virus infection, although the mechanisms are not well defined (He et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, these studies suggest LL-37 AMPs can serve as viable antiviral therapeutics.",

Here we used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing EBOV-GP and green fluorescence protein (rVSV-EBOVgp-GFP, in short, VSV-eGP) as an experimental system to test the effects of AMPs on EBOV-GP-mediated infection. Initially, we screened 20 AMPs including the parent human LL-37 and its engineered variants. We found that two engineered LL-37 variant peptides 17BIPHE2 (in short 17BI) and GI-20d were most potent in inhibiting VSV-eGP infection (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to focus on these two peptides and the relevant control peptides in this study (listed in Figure 1 ). The parent LL-37 peptide was included as a baseline control. Peptides GF-17 and GI-20 containing the native sequences for 17BI and GI-20d, respectively, were derived from the major antimicrobial region of LL-37 Wang et al., 2008) . Peptide 17BI was engineered with three Dform amino acids and two biphenylalanines based on the sequence of GF-17 . GI-20d is a novel peptide engineered with all D-form amino acids with identical sequence to GI-20.

In the absence of WT virus, replication can be studied using an EBOV mini-genome system (Cressey et al., 2017) . We next examined the effects of AMPs on EBOV replication using this system. The EBOV minigenome plasmids (encoding firefly luciferase reporter gene flanked by the leader and trailer sequences from EBOV genome) were co-transfected into HeLa cells with four supporting plasmids encoding EBOV replication complex components NP, L, VP35, and VP30 and a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (for normalization of transfection efficiency).

None of the tested AMPs (at 5 mM) led to a significant change of the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase, whereas the positive control Ribavirin significantly reduced . Ebola VLPs were produced by co-expressing the EBOV matrix protein, VP40 (fused to b-lactamase), and the EBOV GP.

We postulated that AMPs composed of L-amino acids are more susceptible to degradation by proteolytic enzymes inside cells, thus reducing their availability to block CatB in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the AMPs were susceptible to CatS cleavage in an in vitro reaction. CatS was used because it is the most abundant cathepsin in the endosome/lysosome of macrophages and LL-37 has been shown to be an excellent substrate of CatS (Shi et al., 1992; Andrault et al., 2015) . All the AMPs composed of L-amino acids only were completely degraded by CatS treatment in the reaction, whereas AMPs containing D-amino acids (17BI and GI-20d) were resistant to CatS cleavage ( Figure 6A ). The data indicate that AMPs composed of L-amino acids are susceptible to degradation by CatS upon entering cells. We then hypothesized that blockage of CatS may stabilize these AMPs inside cells, thus making them available to inhibit CatB-mediated EBOV entry. To test the hypothesis, Vero cells were pretreated with a CatS inhibitor for 2 h, followed by the addition of AMPs and VSV-eGP. CatS inhibitor treatment significantly improved the efficacy of LL-37, GF-17, and GI-20 by 4-to 10-fold in their inhibition of VSV-eGP infection ( Figure 6B ). Notably, CatS inhibitor also improved the efficacy of 17BI and GI-20d by 1.5-to 2-fold and CatS inhibitor treatment alone resulted in 30% inhibition of VSV-eGP infection, likely due to the known ability of the inhibitor to cross-inhibit CatB.",

These results suggest the important role of CatS in mediating the instability of LL-37-based AMPs inside cells. A previous study has reported that LL-37 is an excellent substrate for CatS with seven potential cleavage sites (Andrault et al., 2015) .

Two potential mechanisms may explain the observation. First, as professional antigen-presenting cells, macrophages likely contain an abundance of proteases such as cathepsin S; therefore, AMP peptides are less available in macrophages to inhibit viral infection. Second, it is known that primary macrophages are more refractory to EBOV infection compared with tissue-culture cell lines (i.e., Vero, HeLa). As such, EBOV macrophage infection requires a 10-fold higher MOI compared with cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that an increase in the amounts of AMPs is needed to achieve similar degrees of inhibition. Finally, it should be noted that our data are consistent with findings that EBOV neutralizing antibodies, such as 13C6, demonstrate less potency with higher IC 50 values in primary macrophages relative to cell lines.",

Because the most common route of EBOV infection is through blood or other body fluids, we anticipate that intravenous injection of engineered AMP peptides will be most effective, although topical use of the peptides could be an option to combat EBOV infection through direct skin contact. These animal studies will further confirm that engineered LL-37 AMPs are a novel class of anti-EBOV therapeutics.",
