This chapter will use the term \"urbanization\" to refer to this demographic shift. Urbanization is the result of migration from rural to urban locales as well as the imbalance between death and fertility rates in urban and rural locales-that is, the proportionally higher ratio of births vs. deaths in cities compared to countryside. It is important to recognize, however, that \"urban\" and therefore \"urbanization\" are terms that are not easily fi xed. The United Nations Statistics Division recognizes that \"because of national differences in the characteristics which distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between urban and rural population is not amenable to a single de fi nition applicable to all countries\" [ 2 ] . Nevertheless, for the purposes of this discussion, we will use the term \"urbanization\" to refer most basically to the demographic shift from less densely populated localities to more densely populated localities. Additional assumptions regarding the implications of urbanization will be explicitly addressed throughout this chapter.",

Several variables are basic to the mathematics of epidemics [ 3, 4 ] . Models for describing epidemics are based upon the reproductive rate of a given disease-that is, the number of individuals infected directly by the primary case (the fi rst infected person) during the time when she/he is infectious. The reproductive rate is itself determined by the attack rate of the disease (i.e., the risk of transmission in any given encounter), as well as the number of encounters the primary case would have, on average, during the infectious period of the disease. In other words, the greater the population density, the greater the number of encounters and the greater the reproductive rate. There are other factors that determine how a disease will be spread, including acquisition of immunity during an outbreak, existing immunity, the rate at which infected and susceptible individuals enter and leave the community, as well as the different types of encounter required for disease spread (i.e., via droplets, fecal-oral route, vectors, etc.). Population density is one of the most basic variables that affects the duration and impact of an epidemic.",

A signi fi cant proportion of the increase in urban population is due to the migration of people from rural areas to urban areas. As we will discuss in more detail further on this chapter, this can allow for the importation of diseases that were formerly con fi ned to rural areas to urban centers where there may be increased opportunity to spread. This can also allow for increased opportunity to spread if, due to lack of prior exposure, migrants to a given area are more susceptible to a disease that is endemic to that area. In addition, as globalization continues and travel increases among the major cities both nationally and internationally, diseases can be propagated between and among urban centers. This can lead to farther-reaching-even worldwide-outbreaks of disease. Historically, travel by boat or train has enabled the transmission of endemic diseases to novel populations, causing outbreaks of diseases such as measles and smallpox and contributing to the decimation of native peoples. More recently, however, air travel has expedited the movement of airborne pathogens [ 5 ] . Viruses can now travel across the world within 24 hours, rather than within days. This statistic becomes even more powerful when considered together with the fact that more than one billion individuals worldwide travel by airplane each year [ 6, 7 ] .",

Once a certain level of immunity against a given disease is achieved, either through the conferring of immunity to infected individuals who survive an exposure or through vaccination, the reproductive rate is necessarily reduced as the risk of transmission in a given encounter is decreased. Limits to the spread of disease and the propagation of an epidemic occur when enough individuals in a community are immune to the disease such that the likelihood of an infected individual encountering a susceptible individual is very low. This is the basis for the concept of \"herd immunity.\" The level of immunity required to prevent or interrupt a disease outbreak varies depending on the pathogen. Vaccination programs, which are discussed next, aim to reduce the percentage of individuals susceptible to a given disease and, ideally, achieve high enough rates of immunity to eradicate it.",

Inoculation, also called variolation, was likely also practiced in Africa, Turkey, and India long before the 1700s when the practice became more common in England and the rest of Europe and ultimately led to modern vaccination [ 9 ] .

To maintain these successes moving forward, vaccination programs will have to be expanded to meet the needs of a growing population. Failure to do so will likely lead to resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, as in the recent urban outbreaks of yellow fever in several West African cities including Abidjan, Ivory Coast (2001 and 2008), Dakar, Senegal (2002), and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (2004). These outbreaks were likely catalyzed by lower vaccination rates in conjunction with increasing population density and overcrowding conditions favorable for the Aedes spp. mosquitoes that carry the virus [ 13 ] . Even in developed countries like the USA, vaccination remains an issue. Measles resurged in Southern California between 1988 and 1990, predominantly in urban young adults and children under 5 years of age who had not yet been vaccinated. Outbreaks occurred within schools, colleges, detention facilities, and other institutions in urban areas. In order to control these outbreaks, schools required immediate immunization of non-immunized children and many re-immunization programs were launched [ 14 ] . Finally, vaccination is not only a key to prevention of epidemics but is also a cornerstone of curtailing the spread of disease during epidemics and pandemics.",

These interventions included \"social distancing\" policies such as closings of schools, churches, and theaters, as well as prohibitions on large public gatherings. Recent analyses of historical data have demonstrated that such interventions, when implemented early, were associated with approximately 50% lower peak death rates and lower cumulative excess mortality [ 24 ] . The duration of these interventions also had an effect; when cities relaxed these restrictions, the epidemic returned with a rebound in morbidity and mortality [24] [25] [26] . Another study used mathematical models to demonstrate that the number of infected individuals to which a healthy individual is exposed also may correlate with mortality-that is, the greater the exposure, the more severe the illness and the higher the case fatality rate [ 27 ] . These studies have led many public health experts to argue in favor of a multipronged approach including early, sustained non-pharmacologic interventions alongside use of antivirals and vaccine development in the event of another in fl uenza pandemic.",

H5N1 Avian in fl uenza is now epidemic among poultry and likely some migratory birds as well. When H5N1 is transmitted to humans, the route appears to be via direct contact with infected birds rather than via contact with other infected humans. This explains why the H5N1 virus did not become epidemic or pandemic among people.

There were only three in fl uenza pandemics in the twentieth century, in 1918, 1957, and 1968 . This is because in order for an in fl uenza virus to cause a pandemic, three conditions must be met: fi rst, the viral strain must be antigenically novel such that the population has little or no preexisting immunity; second, the strain must be transmitted to humans; and third, the strain must be ef fi ciently transmitted from person to person [ 34, 35 ] . Once these conditions are met, particularly in the age of urbanization and globalization, worldwide spread occurs rapidly. As with SARS, all of the index cases in the early weeks of the H1N1 pandemic of 2009-2010 could be traced to air travel from the index city [ 36 ] .",

There may be several reasons for this. First, unlike for Aedes spp. mosquitoes, urban areas are inhospitable environments for Anopheles mosquito development, the major vectors of the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria [ 57 ] . City pollution is thought to inhibit larval development of Anopheles mosquitoes [ 58 ] . In addition, city dwellers have increased access to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Urban residents have a rate of ITN use three times higher than that of rural residents in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, urban residents live in closer proximity to health-care facilities compared to their rural counterparts, affording them greater access to treatment for malaria once infected [ 54 ] .",

Furthermore, there is an emerging concern that many city residents lack suf fi cient immunity to malaria [ 58 ] and that urban children in endemic countries who regularly visit rural areas may be at increased risk for malarial anemia [ 62 ] . In cities where farming activities exist, so, too, does the potential for the urban environment to support anopheline mosquito development [ 58 ] .

MDR-TB accounted for 440,000 cases worldwide in 2008 [ 63 ] . MDR-TB has been reported in many large cities, such as Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Shanghai [ 13, 71, 73, 74 ] and in smaller numbers, XDR-TB cases have been documented in many cities around the world [ 75, 76 ] . New York City alone reported 19 cases of XDR-TB between 1993 and 2006 [ 77 ] . Data from Mumbai, India, found much higher rates of MDR-TB in Mumbai, compared to rural areas of India [ 78 ] . In China, there is concern that workers from rural areas infected with TB are migrating to the cities in search of work, consequently transmitting TB and possibly contributing to TB drug resistance [ 71, 79 ] There is concern that these Chinese migrants are neither seeking nor receiving appropriate, timely TB treatment [ 80 ] . The case fatality rate associated with MDR-TB is much higher than for nonresistant TB, especially if left untreated. Researchers studying TB in a poor section of Sao Paolo, Brazil, for example, reported a 60% mortality rate among the non-HIVinfected MDR-TB patients in the study sample [ 74 ] .",

Urbanization may, however, in fl uence behaviors that affect the risk of acquiring HIV, including alcohol and drug use as well as sexual behavior. Migrants to urban centers are often young people who are separated from their families and traditional social structures. In addition, the disparity between the rich and poor in urban environments can be stark.

Much of this literature focuses on Asian countries. In China, where an estimated 140 million migrants reportedly exist, studies have described risky sexual practices and poor knowledge about HIV among male migrant workers [ 85 ] , and even among migrant workers' school-aged children [ 86 ] . A study of male taxi drivers from rural Bangladesh who migrated for work to the capital, Dhaka, reported that approximately 60% of respondents had recently engaged in sex with commercial sex workers without using condoms [ 87 ] . Several studies of commercial sex workers in cities of India have documented the elevated risk of HIV infection among this population [ 88 ] . The phenomenon of young women and girls migrating to cities, becoming engaged in commercial sex work, and contracting HIV is well documented. A recent study of 287 Nepalese women and girls who had been sex-traf fi cked into urban brothels in India and then returned to Nepal revealed a 38% HIV-positive rate among these victims [ 89 ] . Seventeen of these women and girls were also found to have TB [ 90 ] . It appears that sexual behaviors of migrant workers will help fuel the spread of HIV in cities-but also in the rural communities to which these workers will return. Similar factors likely contribute to the transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has seen an impressive redistribution of populations and rise of ruralto-urban migration. Between 1960 and 1980, the crude population density more than doubled across sub-Saharan Africa and there was a nearly tenfold increase in the number of cities with populations exceeding 500,000 [ 91 ] .",

Tuberculosis infection tends to be both more severe and more dif fi cult to treat among patients with HIV. Opportunistic infections, including infections with molds and fungus, may be in fl uenced by movement between rural and urban environments. The high-risk sexual behaviors that lead to HIV transmission also place individuals at risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis. Additionally, because injection drug use has primarily been an urban health issue, urbanization may lead to an increase in injection drug use and thus further the spread of HIV. Injection drug use with shared needles can transmit many other viruses in addition to HIV. Approximately one in fi ve injection drug users (approximately 16 million worldwide) is HIV-positive [ 94 ] . HIV also increases the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-almost a third of individuals with HIV are co-infected with HCV [ 95, 96 ] .",

Hence, not only \"slum upgrading\" but also prevention of slums will be important in order to mitigate the harmful effects of rapid urbanization. Further development of health systems in parallel with improved housing, sanitation, and access to clean water is necessary. Anticipating continued growth and expansion should prompt governments to dedicate additional resources to urban planning. Vaccination, monitoring and reporting of new cases, and ring chemoprophylaxis are critical for curtailing epidemics and pandemics. Disease surveillance systems and systems for communication and reporting are crucial [ 98 ] . Rapid innovations in information technology may inform the development of such systems.",

First, there is a need to address the looming threat of bioterrorism, which capitalizes on the epidemiologic principles discussed in this chapter. Four diseases are recognized to have signi fi cant bioterrorism potential in urban settings. This chapter has discussed two disease agents-plague and smallpox virus-which can spread from person to person. The other two are anthrax (spores) and botulism (toxin), which are not spread from person to person but could cause mass infection and death if released in aerosolized form into a crowded area or, in the case of botulinum toxin, into the food supply. Outbreak preparedness requires identi fi cation of vaccines and treatments for these potential threats, developers who would be able to produce vaccines and treatments should need arise, and a sophisticated system of targeted, ef fi cient diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and, where necessary, vaccination, to curtail further spread.",

MRSA is now found fairly widely in the community and may be more common in urban residents compared to rural residents [ 99 ] . Less common but of great concern is the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA). Only a few cases of VRSA have been reported in the USA to date [ 100 ] , Aedes mosquitoes thrive in urban environments; Anophales mosquitoes do not. Rapid increases in population density can overwhelm vaccination programs, decrease herd immunity, and render a population more susceptible to outbreaks. Access to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment is greater in urban areas. Urban centers increasingly encroach on adjacent wilderness, bringing human hosts into closer contact with vectors.",
