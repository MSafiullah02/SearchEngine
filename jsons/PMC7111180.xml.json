This review discusses the strong link between asthma and viral infections. Viral infections trigger infant wheezing episodes, have been implicated in the inception of asthma, and are recognized as an important risk factor for asthma exacerbations (Fig 1\n).",

The modified Asthma Predictive Index (API), mainly based on atopic characteristics, is often used to predict risk of school-age asthma and in birth cohort studies has been predictive of atopic asthma but not nonatopic asthma.11 Lukkarinen et al10 considered the characteristics used in the API, in combination with viral origin, in infants hospitalized with first-time wheeze and found that RV-induced wheezing, alone or with sensitization and eczema, predicted atopic asthma at school age. On the other hand, parental smoking, RSV infection with first wheeze, and wheezing before 1 year of age were found to be risk factors for nonatopic asthma at school-age.10 These differences in risk factors highlight important mechanistic differences between RV-induced and RSV-induced disease, with RV-induced wheezing being a more important risk factor in atopic individuals (Fig 2).",

An Australian birth cohort demonstrated the risk for wheezing at 5 years of age was only associated with infant RV wheezing in children who had evidence of sensitization.7 Furthermore, in the COAST study, the greatest risk for asthma was in infants who had both RV wheezing and sensitization to at least one aeroallergen.18 Although it is unclear whether sensitization or viral infection came first, it seems most likely that allergic sensitization itself is a risk factor for RV-induced wheezing.13, 20 In the COAST study, early-life aeroallergen sensitization preceded RV infection, leading the authors to hypothesize that allergic sensitization may be what drives viral wheezing.13 Children sensitized to multiple aeroallergens early in life have the highest risk for persistent wheeze, severe asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization, and impaired lung function.21, 22 There are many pathways between RV infections and allergic inflammation that can potentially explain the increased risk of asthma that occurs with RV wheezing and atopy, and these are briefly reviewed in the mechanism section below.",

In fact, they followed up the cohort until 18 years of age and reported an increase in asthma, allergic sensitization, and clinical allergy and a decrease in pulmonary function on spirometry in the RSV group.8 The Tucson respiratory study, a nonselected birth cohort study, linked RSV-induced bronchiolitis to asthma for up to 13 years.26 In this study, RSV-induced wheeze was a risk factor for recurrent wheeze, but the risk of wheeze decreased and was insignificant by 13 years of age, conflicting with the results from the study by Sigurs et al.28 A Finnish study found an association between RSV and self-reported asthma in children 15 to 18 years of age.29 Another study found that infants born 3 months before the RSV season had the highest risk of asthma between 4 and 5 years of age.29 Contrary to these studies, the COAST study and an Australian birth cohort, both high-risk birth cohorts, did not identify an association between RSV as an infant and the development of asthma in school age/30 The ambiguity in results among these studies is likely attributable to the differences in population among the studies because mechanisms differ between RV and RSV for causing virus-induced disease. Most notably, sensitization does not seem to be a risk factor for infants who develop RSV-induced wheezing26 but is an important risk factor in infants who have RV-triggered wheeze. Hence, RSV will be less significant in atopic populations, such as those present in the COAST study and the Australian study group.",

Children with severe virus-inducted bronchiolitis were born with increased bronchial responsiveness compared with children without bronchiolitis,13 and patients with asthma have an altered epithelial immune response to RV.36 Many posit that infant RV-wheezing episodes occur in infants predisposed to develop asthma.4 The host factors that contribute to severe viral infection, predispose patients to atopy, and respond to viral wheezing with enhanced airway damage may actually be significant risk factors for the development of asthma.

RV can cause a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic to severe infection requiring hospitalization. Most RV infections in children with asthma do not lead to an exacerbation, however. Several factors predispose children to an exacerbation, most notably of which is a history of atopy. Studies in the emergency department have found that detection of respiratory virus, allergen sensitization,43, 44 and eosinophil inflammation are risk factors for acute wheezing. Higher levels of aeroallergen specific IgE imparted the greatest risk, further supporting the synergistic association between RV infection and IgE, leading to increased risk of wheezing.43, 44 Similar to the greater association with wheezing infections in infants, RV-A and RV-C infections lead to more severe illness and are more often associated with asthma exacerbations than RV-B.2, 4 Furthermore, RV-C might be more strongly associated with severe asthma exacerbations and asthma hospitalizations because of a stronger inflammatory response being elicited by the virus.45\n",

Despite the reduction in early wheeze, there was no reduction in the rate of asthma.47, 48 This finding was not surprising given the fact that RSV is a risk factor for wheezing in infants but this risk of recurrent wheeze diminishes with age. Another RSV antibody, motavizumab, administered to a high-risk group in the first year of life reduced the risk of hospital admissions for wheezing by 87% but did not lead to a reduction in medically treated wheezing between 1 and 3 years of age.49 Taken together, these studies indicate that monoclonal antibody therapy directed against RSV in preterm infants can reduce bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing.

Indeed, treatment with omalizumab, either year-round or seasonal pretreatment, led to a decrease in seasonal exacerbations and a decrease in RV in nasal secretions, especially among children with severe asthma.52, 53 The mechanism of this effect is not known. We found that humans make IgE against RV (and others have found that IgE can be made against RSV).54, 55 This finding suggests that anti-IgE might block asthma exacerbations in a similar manner to how it is able to inhibit airway allergen\u2013induced asthma. An alternate explanation is based on the observation that reduction of IgE led to increased type I interferon production from plasmacytoid dendritic cells ex vivo.56 This finding suggest that anti-IgE might increase antiviral immunity. Consistent with both of these observations, treatment with omalizumab decreases the severity of asthma exacerbations associated with RV.57 As a side note, a randomized clinical trial of inhaled interferon beta (type I interferon) found no benefit with treatment in the primary end points of Asthma Control Questionnaire score and forced expiratory volume in 1 second, suggesting that decreased type I interferon is not the mechanism of asthma exacerbations. Some have argued that this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate power for the entire study population. In particular, the inclusion of patients with mild asthma who experienced upper respiratory tract infection\u2013induced exacerbations may have skewed the results toward no benefit. However, a benefit was seen in a subpopulation with severe asthma in Asthma Control Questionnaire score and peak expiratory flow.58\n",

Patients with asthma have been reported to have a delayed and decreased antiviral response, likely thought to be attributable to decreased production of innate interferons.59, 60, 61 Impaired type I interferon expression likely contributes to asthma by allowing uncontrolled replication of viral infections and by leaving TH2 inflammation unchecked; however, this assertion has not been well proved. In fact, although some studies have supported the idea that there is decreased interferon expression in patients with asthma,35, 59, 60, 62, 63 others have disputed this finding.64, 65 It is believed, however, that there is at least a subgroup of patients with asthma who have impaired type I interferon responses. One birth cohort study found that the population of patients with asthma and impaired IFN response to RV at 11 years of age also had increased wheeze in infancy, asthma in adolescence, and more frequent asthma exacerbations and were more likely to have allergic sensitization in infancy.10 Type I interferon levels demonstrate an inverse association with changes in lung function, eosinophilia, and other markers of inflammation after RV infection.61 However, as mentioned above, administration of type I interferon did not have a significant effect in improving asthma symptoms or lung function in most patients with asthma.58\n",

These neutrophils then induced expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u0190RI) on lung conventional dendritic cells. At the same time, the mice made IgE against Sendai virus, which then bound the Fc\u0190RI expressing conventional dendritic cells and could be crosslinked by the virus. This process led to production of CCL28, a TH2 cell chemoattractant, which drove an influx of TH2 cells and interleukin (IL) 13 production, and the subsequent airway hyperreactivity and mucous cell hyperplasia.66, 70, 71\n",

Some studies have found sensitization preceding viral infection.13, 20 Allergic inflammation can increase airway responsiveness to RV infection74 and has been suggested to lead to greater viral replication.75, 76 As described previously, RSV infections have a greater association with the development of nonatopic asthma and RV infections with atopic asthma. However, RSV has been associated with the development of atopy in a subset of patients. In fact, viral infections, including RSV and paramyxoviral infections, have been associated with development of asthma and atopy.70 In a mouse model, we found that exposure to a nonviral antigen during the viral infection was sufficient to drive specific IgE production against the nonviral antigen, outlining a potential mechanism for postviral development of atopy.77 Furthermore, viral infections damage the barrier function of airway epithelium, which can allow for greater absorption of aeroallergens, leading to a potential increase in allergic sensitization.75, 76\n",
