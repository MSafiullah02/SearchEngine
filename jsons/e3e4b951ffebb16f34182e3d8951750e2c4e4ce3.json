The government of different countries has adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were social distancing and lockdown. We use a simple log-linear model with intercept and trend break to evaluate whether the measures are effective preventing/slowing down the spread of the disease in Turkey. We estimate the model parameters from the Johns Hopkins University (2020) epidemic data between 15th March and 16th April 2020. Our analysis revealed that the measures can slow down the outbreak. We can reduce the epidemic size and prolong the time to arrive at the epidemic peak by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities.",

On 27 March, all international flights were terminated, and intercity travel was subject to approval by the state governors. Furthermore, historical sites and picnic areas are closed on weekends. On 3 April 2020, the government issued a 15-day entry ban to 30 metropolitan cities as well as Zonguldak, which is extended later. Furthermore, the curfew was extended to people younger than 20 years old. Using masks in public places became mandatory ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Turkey).",

Due to substantial delays between new infections and their measurement in statistics, we could see further effects from the government measures in the near future. Corona measures need to be taken carefully and timely. During the implementation of these measures, it is necessary to avoid practices that will cause the general public to panic. If this cannot be done, social distance measures will be neglected and measures to prevent the spread of the disease will be harmed.",

As can be seen from the levels figure on the left side, the cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases increasing exponentially, taking logs of this variable yields a time series with a linear trend. These figures indicate that a linear time trend may characterize the dynamics of log confirmed cases well, although there are some levels and trend shifts in the sample. There are a few outliers at the beginning of the sample. In the first week (12-18 March), an outbreak of Covid-19 among returning travelers from Europe, the US, Iran, and Saudi Arabia increased the case numbers.",

All parameters are significant at a 1% level. Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation, LM test, and White heteroscedasticity test results indicate that there is no serial correlation and heteroscedasticity in the residuals, Furthermore, the Jarque-Bera test result shows that the residuals have normal distribution. The slope estimates can be interpreted as follows. From 15 March to 20 March, the estimated daily growth rate is 71%, indicating a doubling of confirmed cases every 0.98 days. From 20 March to 27March, the daily growth rate reduces to 25.6%, which implies a doubling of confirmed cases every 2.73 days. We can see this as an initial shocking announcement effect of the first confirmed case and governments' a series of measures for social distancing on 12 March. From 27 March to 1 April, the daily growth reduces to 21.1%, between 1 and12 April the growth rate reduces further to 11.9%, and finally between 12 and 18 April the growth rate reduces to 6.2% which implies a doubling of confirmed cases every 11.29 days. Our results show that the growth of confirmed cases slowed considerably from 21 March onwards.",
