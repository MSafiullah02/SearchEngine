Severe perturbations of this balance of 60 modifications and interactions lead to inappropriate protein folding, association and 61 aggregation. Those protein aggregates, if a certain threshold is surpassed and perpetuated, 62 diffract incident light leading to lens opacification and cataractogenesis. In addition, the 63 crystallins in high concentration are more than physical structural components of the 64 crystalline lens, and their protein species have additional multiple catalytical or regulatory 65 functions affecting the transparency of the lens and thus, cataractogenesis. Therefore, it is 66 necessary to understand the dynamics of this protein superfamily. Proteomics research is an 67 ideal way to characterize the healthy lenticular protein constituents and elucidate the complex 68 factors involved in cataractogenesis, given that the lens consists mainly of proteins and water. 69",

The 303 researchers found that the proteins from all lenses contained numerous sites of deamidation, 304 oxidation, Cys-methylation, and acetylation. Deamidation was the most common PTM. An 305 increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged 306 normal lenses. Methylation of Cys in lens proteins was also reported (five Cys residues were 307 detected as being modified in the young lens group, four in the old normal lenses, and three in 308 the cataract lenses). A new phosphorylation site, in Hains P.G. and Truscott R.J. (2008) (16) examined the lens proteome using foetal (two sets), 317 aged normal (three, 59, 65 and 80 year old), and advanced nuclear cataract lenses (three 60, 318 65 and 80 year old). They identified 231 proteins across all lens samples, of which 183 in 319 foetal, 103 in adult normal and 105 in cataractous lenses. Of those, 60 proteins were found to 320 be common to all lens, while 22 previously unreported proteins were identified in normal 321 aged and 29 in cataract lenses. They stated as well that for most of the proteins presented, the 322 relative abundance of foetal lens proteins was greater than either of the other lens groups, with 323 the exception of phakinin (BFSP2_HUMAN), protein DJ-1 (PARK7_HUMAN) and 324 phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1_HUMAN), where both cataract and aged normal lenses 325 had greater relative abundance. 326In addition to this, they reported that several proteins had a high abundance in the foetal lens 327 group but a much reduced level in both adult lens groups, including betaine-homocysteine S.G. and Truscott R.J.
