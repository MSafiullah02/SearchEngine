In a recent publication, Ficarra et al. advised the suspension of non-emergency urological interventions and the expert panel suggested recommendations for the organization of surgical cases [6]. Stone disease is a unique condition which can cause emergency conditions and also adverse effects on the kidney function during long-term follow-up. Therefore, appropriate management in a timely manner is crucial. Approach to urinary stones and related conditions can vary from major surgeries under general anesthesia (i.e. percutaneous nephrolithotomy) to less invasive applications under local anesthesia (i.e. nephrostomy placement). It has been recently shown that the practice patterns for stone disease also were altered due to COVID-19 pandemic [7].",

For this reason, surgeons were obliged to make their own decisions during the preoperative evaluation at the beginning of the pandemic and then began to act according to internal regulations of their institutions and internal guidelines of their countries. Related with this issue, although some national and international organizations began to report their recommendations based on their limited experience obtained; there is still no consensus between such organizations to give reliable, established guidance to practicing surgeons [8].",

Aside from the cases with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, the asymptomatic patients or the ones within the incubation period may cause transmission of the viral infection to the healthcare professionals and other patients. On the other hand again, due to the direct exposure to the airway of the patients, anesthesiologists are at great risk for being infected during interventions [9]. In a recent study, Lie et al. stated that regional anesthesia on this aspect could provide a successful anesthesia for the patient and be helpful in the protection for the anesthesiology team [10]. However, Baig et al. also reported that COVID-19 virus can involve the central nervous system [11] and viral transmission could be possible during regional anesthesia as well. Therefore, it is obvious that relying on the safety of regional anesthesia does not provide complete protection for the health care professionals and principles for optimal preoperative evaluation during the pandemic need to be determined.",

While some guidelines suggest PCR testing in suspicious cases, the guidelines for sections with a high likelihood of virus load, such as otolaryngology, suggest that it can be performed in all patients [14]. The rate of PCR testing was 6.6% in our cohort without any positive result preoperatively. Chest CT was commonly applied in preoperative evaluation during the pandemic due to the fact that it can demonstrate relevant objective, indicative changes in the affected lungs even in the PCR false-negative patients [13]. In our cohort, a CT scan was applied in 268 (56.7%) patients in the absence of a positive result detected by any means. Among these 268 patients, 250 of them were operated in China and this result is concordant with the result of a recent meta-analysis indicating the low prevalence of screening with chest CT outside of China [15]. Also Chinese national guidelines advocate chest CT examination in every admitted patient for surgery [16]. However, taking the reported respective sensitivity and specificity of chest CT as 94% and 37% into account, some long term detrimental consequences of radiation exposure necessitates its application with caution as well [15]. In our cohort two patients without a preoperative adequate screening were diagnosed postoperatively with positive test results for COVID-19 in both PCR and CT scan evaluations.",

Interestingly, neither anesthesia method, nor treatment strategy was altered in the Chinese center. This could be due to the fact that the Chinese authorities had a better COVID-19 control or the recommendations on this aspect were published a while later from the beginning of the COVID-19 in China [17]. In out trial, we also investigated the change in practice patterns related to time and the ROC analysis revealed 21 days as the cut-off. Among patients operated in Europe the rate of additional testing significantly increased after 21 days (4.8% vs. 41.4%). Therefore we believe that it took at least 21 days for the hospital regulations to be evolved and surgeons to get adapted to the pandemic situation. This is also in accordance with the increased rate of emergency procedures (38.8% vs. 76.6%) and decreased rate of general anesthesia (58.8% vs. 46.5%) after 21 days in the European cohort.",

However, this rate was also higher in European cohort (14.8%) and significantly increased from 7.9 to 34.5% after 21 days. Also, there was a tendency to perform more conservative approaches such as nephrostomy tube or JJ stent placement rather than definitive treatment options namely ureterorenoscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the > 21 days group. Therefore, our findings indicate well that after 21 days of time period following the diagnosis of first case, the rate of testing performed for preoperative screening, number of cases treated in an emergency basis and also the alterations in type of interventions were all increased. While conservative approaches became preferred alternatives in the same period, number of cases treated under general anesthesia did decrease to a certain extent. This shift after 21 days may be explained by increased COVID-19 workload in the urology departments of hospitals and also avoidance of definitive treatment options requiring general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation.",
