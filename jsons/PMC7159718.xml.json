            "text": "Community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses are common causes of upper and lower respiratory tract disease both in the immunocompetent and immunosuppressed host. A diverse group of viruses are responsible for these diseases including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and enterovirus. With the exception of adenovirus (which is discussed in a separate section of these guidelines), all of these microbial organisms are single stranded RNA viruses. Community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses cause a variety of clinical manifestations and disease severity ranging from mild congestion and rhinorrhea to more severe tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. They are increasingly recognized as a cause of illness after both solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, particularly in children. All are potential nosocomial pathogens which can be potentially spread by staff or visitor with mild upper respiratory illness. However, few large series are available (especially among solid organ transplant recipients) to help define the full scope of this problem as well as the best preventive or treatment strategies. To a large extent this is due to a lack of surveillance and diagnostic studies, particularly when patients are at home, often at a site distant from the transplant center. Data emerging from retrospective series or those looking at patients early after transplantation will be weighted towards identifying patients with more severe illness as extensive diagnostic evaluations are unlikely to be performed in individuals with mild symptoms.",

In general, transmission of all of these viral pathogens occurs by spread from person to person through direct or close contact with contaminated secretions which may involve droplets or fomites. In addition, influenza virus may be spread by small particle aerosols. Accordingly, attention to good hygienic practices, in particular hand washing, should be part of infection control and prevention both in and out of the hospital. Supportive care is a mainstay of treatment. Specific antiviral agents are not available for coronavirus and parainfluenza. Specific data on RSV, influenza and PIV in the transplant population are discussed in more detail.",

            "text": "The RNA virus is a cause of seasonal annual epidemics worldwide. In temperate climates RSV strikes in the fall, winter and early spring. By 2 years of age, virtually all children have experienced a primary infection. In recent years it is has become clear that re\u2010infection can occur throughout life. While symptoms of RSV infection tend to be milder in older children and adults, these individuals may serve as a reservoir for transmission to more susceptible hosts. RSV has been recognized as a cause of severe disease after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (1, 2, 3, 4). Likewise, it is recognized as a cause of respiratory disease after pediatric solid\u2010organ transplantation and is being increasingly recognized in adult recipients (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Risk\u2010factors for development of lower respiratory tract disease in BMT recipients with RSV. infection include lymphocytopenia and neutropenia (4). As many as 60% of BMT recipients infected with RSV will develop lower respiratory tract disease. Once lower tract disease is present, mortality rates ranging from 30 to 80% have been reported (1, 4, 7, 10). Risk factors for more severe disease after organ transplantation include infection in children under a year of age or with underlying lung disease (5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Early acquisition of RSV after transplantation or after augmented immunosuppression has been associated with increased severity of disease in some but not all studies (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13).",

Ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against RSV and the aerosolized form of this drug has been approved for the treatment of lower respiratory tract disease due to RSV in certain at\u2010risk populations. Despite its FDA approval, convincing data describing the clinical efficacy of this agent are lacking and a consensus on the utility of this drug in the treatment of RSV disease does not currently exist. Published data on the treatment of RSV disease in solid organ transplant recipients is very limited. However experience from the treatment of BMT recipients may provide guidance for the treatment of RSV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. BMT recipients have a high mortality rate from RSV pneumonia even with the use of aerosolized ribavirin (1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11) prompting the clinical investigation of additional therapeutic options in this patient population. A noncontrolled study using a combination of ribavirin with IVIG with higher RSV titers (RSV\u2010IVIG, Respigam) was performed which appeared to demonstrate a benefit when used early after symptoms developed in BMT recipients (15, 16). The high mortality rate in this patient population would lead many to recommend early therapy (BII). Combinations of aerosolized ribavirin and RSV IVIG (15, 16) or palivizumab (17) (Synagis, MedImmune, Inc; Gaithesburg, Maryland.), an RSV\u2010specific monoclonal antibody, appear to be beneficial in some BMT recipients even when they present with lower respiratory tract disease. Based on these experiences, many experts would recommend the use of the combination of aerosolized ribavirin and either RSV IVIG or palivizumab for the treatment of RSV upper respiratory tract or lower respiratory tract infection in BMT recipients (BII).",

However, these studies report retrospective experiences. Based upon published experience from pediatric organ transplant recipients, patients without risk factors for severe disease and with only upper respiratory infections are unlikely to benefit from aerosolized ribavirin (DII). For patients with upper respiratory tract disease and the presence of risk factors, and for those organ transplant recipients with lower respiratory tract disease the use of aerosolized ribavirin in combination with RSV IVIG or pavilizumab should be considered (BIII).",

However, no studies have been conducted to evaluate their use in the solid organ transplant setting and the cost of the weight adjusted dosing of these products in adults would be extremely high. The unexpected increased risk of death in children with cyanotic heart disease who received RSV IVIG shows the inability to generalize the use of this immunoprophylaxis from one population to another without study. Despite this, some experts would support the use of immunoprophylaxis for children less than 1 year of age who receive their transplant during the RSV season (CIII). While specific prophylaxis is not proven for transplant recipients, aggressive infection control policies (e.g. contact precautions and cohorting of patients) are shown to decrease transmission of RSV and other community respiratory viruses in the hospital (7, 19) (BII).",

Some of these rapid tests can be used for office\u2010based diagnostic testing. Adequate specimen collection and timing of sampling also play important roles in identifying pathogens.

Only the latter two drugs have efficacy against influenza B; early treatment of influenza with inhaled zanamivir or oral oseltamivir appears to reduce the likelihood of lower respiratory tract complications (e.g. bronchiolitis, pneumonia) but none of the drugs has been proven to be efficacious in preventing serious complications from influenza (26). Retrospective analysis indicates that early antiviral treatment with amantadine or rimantadine reduces the likelihood of developing pneumonia in patients with acute leukemia or who have undergone BMT. A review of recommendations for the treatment of influenza virus infections in solid organ transplant recipients is provided in Table 1. Despite the absence of data in organ transplant recipients, most transplant physicians would recommend the use of an antiviral agent for the treatment of organ transplant recipients with influenza virus infections (BIII); many experts would consider the use of a neuraminidase inhibitor either alone or in combination with another drug because of the concern of acquisition of resistance associated with the use of amantadine or rimantadine which may exceed a rate of 30% in these patients. Finally, ribavirin also has in vitro activity against influenza virus and anecdotal reports of its use in immunocompetent hosts with severe influenza infections suggested possible activity (27). Accordingly some would advocate the addition of aerosolized ribavirin to one of the antiviral agents for a transplant patient with serious influenza infection (CIII).",

Influenza vaccine should also be administered to people who have contact with high\u2010risk patients such as health care workers and household contacts (BIII). The response to influenza vaccine has been studied in a number of transplant settings (25). While the vaccine year, specific influenza strain, and recipient type lead to variations in antibody response, several conclusions can be made. First, transplant recipients do not have as strong a response to vaccine as healthy controls. Despite this, 30\u2013100% of patients achieved protective hemagglutination\u2010inhibiting serum antibody titers. Accordingly, yearly vaccination should be strongly considered (AII). Yearly vaccination should likewise be recommended for all health care workers and household contacts. Chemoprophylaxis with antiviral agents can be used effectively in at\u2010risk populations who have not received vaccine or who have not had an opportunity to respond to recent vaccination during the time when influenza is already circulating in the community (BIII).
