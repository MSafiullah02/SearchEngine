The rapid adoption of non-pharmacological public health interventions, such as social distancing and lockdown measures, has driven the initial response to an unprecedented extent for the national health system. The national capacity of Italy's health system has traditionally been regarded as an excellent model for a public health service, ensuring effective coverage for all, with 3.12 hospital beds per 1000 people and 3.99 physicians per 1000 inhabitants [2]; the system has been able to deliver efficient and effective healthcare, favouring the country in terms of productivity [3]. However, no health system can be truly prepared or sufficiently flexible for an impressive rise in the demand for intensive care capacity, especially if funded on vertical disease programs. An academic health model anticipated complete saturation of the number of available beds in intensive care units by 14th March 2020, prompting an intersectorial approach that could clearly estimate and communicate the risk for severe COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care [4]. Such an approach broadens the chances for all to access the appropriate treatments, while the daily rate of new COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalisation was slowing down.",

The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in the Lombardy Region in Italy has prompted an urgent response to meet the needs of patient care while maintaining essential healthcare for all. As the pandemic rapidly escalated, the Italian government enforced a state of emergency on a national scale [7]. Furthermore, the regional organs of governance and the emergency regulations emphasised the need to ensure essential care for patients with cancer, a potentially frailer fringe of the population, exposed to both a higher risk of COVID-19 and fatal consequences [8,9]. The bedrock for a priority setting in oncology care is structured in value-based health system planning. Where no significant impairment of the prognosis is anticipated by temporary cessation of the service or changed eligibility conditions, a delay in the treatment can be tolerated [10].",

The investigators from Guangzhou Medical University developed a prospective registry to monitor COVID-19 cases, framing a partnership within the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease under the auspices of the National Health Commission [8]. The authors collected the cases in 31 provincial administrative regions from 575 hospitals; 1% of the patients (n = 18) reported a history of cancer, either survivors receiving curative or palliative treatments or those in palliative care. Eleven of 18 patients were reported as \u2018in follow-up\u2019 and \u2018postoperative\u2019, while four were receiving antineoplastic treatments for advanced disease; five of them were affected by concomitant NCD comorbidities. An excess of smokers (former and current) among the patients with cancer was reported, possibly affected by the presence of seven patients (39%) with tobacco-related tumours. In this study, cancer history represented the strongest single prognostic factor for severe events in COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 5.399), more than age and the presence of other NCDs. When analysing the data only from the cohort of patients with cancer, age was the only risk factor for severe events (OR = 1.43). This finding is consistent with the previous reports on all patients with COVID-19, in which age was an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcomes or mortality [15]. For patients receiving active antitumour treatments, poor prognosis seemed to be dictated by the interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and the last treatment received (\u226414 days), as recently reported [9].",

The often restrictive eligibility criteria for the enrolment in clinical trials inevitably affect the population type, determining a shift to a lower risk population for type and severity of comorbidities and perhaps resulting in less severe outcomes for COVID-19. We report a mixed cohort of patients with diverse histology types and settings of care. While the previous studies seemed to be augmented with some patients with cancer, such as smoke-related malignancies, lung cancer diagnosis could itself represent a possible risk factor for severe outcomes from the infection, as observed in single-case reports and single case series. One of the two patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalised in our study is a patient with oncogene-addicted lung cancer and no comorbidities, receiving targeted therapy. Of interest, the age range of our population falls halfway between the national median age for COVID-19 diagnosis and death. So far, we have observed no death from COVID-19 in our patients, and all the standard protocols for home-based management and regional criteria for hospitalisation have been strictly followed.",

Given that cancer is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes and mortality from COVID-19, an in-depth analysis of the cancer series is highly attractive, as advocated by national institutions, including the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and reference experts with local initiatives and regional networks. The questions of medical oncology for the correct approach in the management of COVID-19 are still multiple and unresolved, in the absence of data; questions include whether there is a need to stop certain types of treatments and whether there is a risk of impairing outcomes when continuing some medications with immune-regulating properties (both suppressing and stimulating).

The key to success of the oncology care envisioned by the authors is embedded in a strong population and resilient health system response to the outbreak, across three principal directives: protect and empower the health workforce, prioritise resources for cancer care for judicious allocation and ensure coordination mechanisms for health institutions with regional, national and global policies and workflows. The implementation of a systematised response of cancer providers, aligned to the national and regional priorities for the communities, in a population health perspective, has resulted in a reduction in the outpatient clinical workload (20% less) and inpatient admissions (30% less) of the National University Cancer Institute of Singapore. Over a period of 1 month, a model of segregation of the workforce has been established, to create parallel cohorts of providers for clinical care, education and research\u2014with no reciprocal connections and a triage mechanism for the access of patients in the institutions. The authors reported only 34 patient admissions due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 during this period and only one confirmed case that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. These data suggest that the bedrock to protect the vulnerable population is not single-institutional decisions, recommendations and guidelines, and the role of the single providers working in isolation can be irrelevant or even harmful when not synchronised under a common agenda for preparedness and response, with a community mandate and based on a coordination mechanism for the urgent reorganisation of the healthcare delivery system, including separate referral pathways for patients with confirmed COVID-19.",
