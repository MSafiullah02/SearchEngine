The US administration's Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy is of grave concern. The PLGHA expanded the Global Gag Rule (the Mexico City policy), which blocks US global health assistance to foreign non-governmental organisations that provide, counsel, refer, or advocate for abortion services. Three crucial impacts of the PLGHA include decreased stakeholder coordination and chilling of sexual and reproductive health and rights discussions; reduced access to family planning, with increases in unintended pregnancy and induced abortion; and negative outcomes beyond sexual and reproductive health, including weakened health systems functioning.13 Migration policies of deterrence, including closures at US and European borders, force women to live in informal settlements or conditions of poverty for long periods of time, often without basic sanitation and hygiene or access to health care during antenatal and postnatal periods.",
