Human infections by members of the genus Serratia were not well recognized until the latter half of the 20th century.1\nSerratia marcescens accounts for the majority of isolates and appears to be a pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of clinical diseases, including wound infections, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, central nervous system infections such as meningitis, and bloodstream infections.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Although S. marcescens is a rare cause of community-acquired infections, it has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen that has been cultured from a variety of sources, including disinfectants,7, 8, 9 pressure transducers,10 bronchoscopes,11 and multidose medication vials.12 Factors such as debilitating clinical condition, lengthy ward stay, exposure to medical interventions, and increased frequency and intensity of direct contact with staff hands predispose patients to S. marcescens infection. S. marcescens isolates account for 12.6% of nosocomial urinary tract infection and resulted in 4.86% fatality in a single institute in Taiwan.13 Although S. marcescens has a relatively low virulence, it often causes nosocomial infections in severely immunocompromised or critically ill patients.1, 2 The mortality rate of S. marcescens bacteremia was approximately 40\u201350% in previous studies.14, 15\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the trends in antimicrobial resistance in S. marcescens from a nationwide surveillance in Taiwan.",
