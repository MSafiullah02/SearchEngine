            "text": "Community structure is an important topic in population biology, yet we have only incomplete understanding of how genetic diversity is organized in a complex multispecies community. To study the composition of a community, researchers have long emphasized the number of species and to a lesser extent their relative numbers (Whittaker & Klomp, 1975). Subsequently, it was shown that the study of community structure could also benefit from a phylogenetic analysis of the component species (Cavender\u2010Bares, Kozak, Fine, & Kembel, 2009; Vamosi & Wilson, 2008). Yet, all these approaches still typically ignore intraspecific variation. This is unfortunate because it is increasingly clear that a multilevel approach is needed to study biological diversity (Larsson, 2001; Wilcox, 1984). Moreover, it is now well established that the genetic diversity of dominant species can feed back on the whole community (Bolnick et al., 2011; Crutsinger et al., 2006). Hence, a full analysis of community structure should integrate functional and phylogenetic intraspecific and interspecific components (Bolnick et al., 2011; Pavoine & Izs\u00e1k, 2014). Whereas a few population genetic studies have sampled and analyzed multiple species simultaneously (Petit et al., 2003; Taberlet et al., 2012), they have not focused on the genetic diversity of entire communities. Performing such a study would provide a unique opportunity to investigate shared genetic variation across species and clarify its origin. It could also help identify new avenues to understand the evolution of communities.",

            "text": "Closely related species can share genetic characteristics if insufficient time has elapsed since speciation for divergence to have taken place through genetic drift or mutation (Neigel & Avise, 1986). The sharing of genetic attributes among species can also be caused by gene flow, which can extend beyond species boundaries as a consequence of hybridization and introgression (Arnold, 1997; Mallet, 2005; Mallet, Besansky, & Hahn, 2015). However, distinguishing introgression from incomplete lineage sorting remains a critical task in evolutionary studies (Joly, McLenachan, & Lockhart, 2009). At the scale of an entire community, the goal is not to understand the origin of genetic similarities in a particular species pair but to look at general trends across species and genera, taking advantage of the sampling of multiple independent lineages within which patterns of polymorphism and of shared genetic variation can be explored. The approaches that need to be implemented in such a context necessarily differ from those used for investigating the origin of genetic exchanges in one particular species pair or species group.",

            "text": "A first possibility to distinguish between incomplete lineage sorting and introgression as a source of intraspecific variation in a given community is to investigate whether genetic diversity is influenced by the presence of congeners. Local presence and relative abundance of congeneric species have long been known to influence hybridization rates (e.g., Cannon & Lerdau, 2015; Focke, 1881; Hubbs, 1955; Natalis & Wesselingh, 2013). Following hybridization, introgression, defined as the movement of genes from a donor species into the gene pool of a recipient species, should typically increase the diversity of the recipient species (Arnold, Bulger, Burke, Hempel, & Williams, 1999; Currat, Ruedi, Petit, & Excoffier, 2008). Hence, a species, genetic diversity should be higher, on average, if it lives close to congeners with which it can exchange genes. In contrast, in the absence of introgression, genetic diversity is not predicted to be higher in the presence of congeners. Whereas introgression is often reported to increase intraspecific genetic diversity (Anderson, 1949,1953; Rieseberg & Wendel, 1993), especially in hybrid zones (e.g., Barton & Hewitt, 1985, Govindaraju, Dancik, & Wagner, 1989), attempts to evaluate the effect of the presence of congeners on intraspecific genetic diversity have only been investigated in a few individual target species (e.g., Valencia\u2010Cuevas et al., 2015; Valencia\u2010Cuevas, Pi\u00f1ero, Mussali\u2010Galante, Valencia\u2010\u00c1valos, & Tovar\u2010S\u00e1nchez, 2014). Ideally, studies of the effect of the presence of congeners on genetic diversity should account for the species' life\u2010history traits known to influence the rate of introgression (Du, Petit, & Liu, 2009; Duminil et al., 2007).",

            "text": "A second way to distinguish between incomplete lineage sorting and introgression is to investigate whether links exist between interspecific sharing of genetic variants and intraspecific genetic diversity. Introgression should result both in the percolation of alleles across species and in an increased genetic diversity in the recipient species. As a consequence, if introgression is involved, an association is expected between interspecific sharing of genetic information and intraspecific variation. In contrast, no such relationship is expected if allele sharing originates from shared ancestry. Hence, focusing simultaneously on allele sharing and on genetic diversity could provide further evidence on the mechanism involved.",

            "text": "Tropical tree communities are well suited for studying the relationship between intra\u2010 and interspecific variation. First, they have particularly high specific and generic diversity (Cannon & Lerdau, 2015; Condit et al., 2005; Figure 1). Second, hybridization is particularly frequent in long\u2010lived woody plants (Ellstrand, Whitkus, & Rieseberg, 1996; Fazekas et al., 2009; Grant, 1981; Mallet, 2005; Petit & Hampe, 2006). Yet, such studies are confronted with operational constraints: Multiple individuals of numerous species must be sampled, reliably identified and consistently scored using suitable molecular markers. Indeed, idiosyncratic hybridization barriers can make generalizations across taxa complicated (Arnold, 1997; Focke, 1881; Grant, 1981; Mallet, 2005; Whitney, Ahern, Campbell, Albert, & King, 2010), requiring the study of many species to detect general trends. Interestingly, prior investigations have demonstrated the feasibility of barcoding large numbers of tropical trees at chloroplast DNA sequences (Gonzalez et al., 2009,2010; Kress et al., 2009,2010; Pei et al., 2011). Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is predominantly maternally inherited in angiosperms (Harris & Ingram, 1991; Petit & Vendramin, 2007). Thus, it is especially prone to introgression, as shown by a neutral model of the process (Currat et al., 2008; Du et al., 2009; Petit & Excoffier, 2009). Hence, cpDNA could be used to estimate the extent of intraspecific genetic diversity and haplotype sharing across species, provided that errors in identifying species of voucher samples are minimized, as they might confound the analyses (e.g., Dexter, Pennington, & Cunningham, 2010).",

We explore whether species with congeners in the community tend to have higher genetic diversity than species lacking congeners. We further test whether this holds regardless of species seed dispersal mode, as seed dispersal is the life\u2010history trait known to be most strongly associated with cpDNA variation in trees (Duminil et al., 2007). We then investigate the distribution of chloroplast haplotypes across species to test whether shared variation among species is associated with high intraspecific variation, as expected in the case of introgression.",

            "text": "Considering these low sample sizes, the levels of cpDNA sequence polymorphism were remarkably high in the study site (26% of polymorphic species). We found that species are more likely to be polymorphic when other congeneric species had been identified in the study site. The presence of congeneric species that coexist locally with a given species is a prerequisite for hybridization and introgression, which ultimately result in the enrichment of the target species gene pool. This reasoning had been used earlier to explain increased genetic diversity in sympatric parts of congeneric species ranges (e.g., Valencia\u2010Cuevas et al., 2014). Generalizing across taxa in a community, we suggest that the observed difference in the rate of cpDNA polymorphism in species with or without congeners can be explained in the same way. Moreover, we found that the trend of higher genetic diversity in the presence of congeners is boosted in species with abiotic mode of dispersal. Such species typically experience reduced gene flow by seeds (Duminil et al., 2007), resulting in increased conspecific spatial aggregation (Seidler & Plotkin, 2006). Maternally inherited cpDNA markers should be more readily introgressed in these species, in line with models predicting an inverse relationship between intraspecific gene flow and introgression (Currat et al., 2008; Du et al., 2009). Hence, the particularly high contrast of cpDNA polymorphism observed in the presence or absence of congeners in abiotically dispersed species further supports our inference that introgression is at least in part responsible for the higher polymorphism in the presence of congeners.",

            "text": "We found 65 unique cpDNA sequences (i.e., haplotypes) shared among at least two species and 437 haplotypes restricted to a single species. Interestingly, the distribution of these haplotypes is not independent of the level of intraspecific variation. Haplotypes detected in polymorphic species are more frequently shared with congeners than haplotypes from monomorphic species. This observation fits well with the hypothesis of introgression, which should result not only in an increased diversity in the recipient species but also in an increased rate of haplotype sharing between the recipient and donor species. If sharing of haplotypes among species was caused instead by the retention of ancestral variants, we would instead expect that haplotypes from monomorphic species (i.e., fixed for a single haplotype) would be preferentially shared, assuming that frequent alleles are on average older than less frequent ones (Slatkin & Rannala, 2000).",

            "text": "In such a study, a number of pitfalls could complicate inferences. We cannot exclude that some unknown biogeographic process results in a pattern whereby species belonging to rapidly diversifying lineages and hence more likely to coexist with congeners have higher levels of intrapopulation variation. However, this hypothesis cannot account for the observed relationship between cpDNA diversity and haplotype sharing. In principle, identification errors could produce the same pattern than introgression (haplotype sharing and increased \u201cintraspecific\u201d diversity). In general, in tropical forests, botanical work is complicated by the difficulty of collecting fertile material from trees during inventories (Dexter et al., 2010), an important problem because sterile material is more difficult to identify to the species level. However, long\u2010term studies such as this one maximize the chances of observing fertile material and hence of correctly identifying species. Moreover, focusing on a single forest, as was done here, should reduce the risk of incorrectly splitting species, compared to studies involving sampling over broad areas. During the study, we adopted a conservative approach, questioning the results of each sample whose haplotype did not fit with that of the other individuals of its species by rechecking sequences and vouchers or collecting new ones. Importantly, we found no evidence for reduced taxonomic resolution in large genera, as haplotype sharing per species pair was lower than average in most of these genera. Hence, identification mistakes are unlikely to account for the high proportion of polymorphic species in genera represented by more than one species in the community. This finding also illustrates an important point: the lack of support for a general snowball effect of introgression in the largest genera. Such an effect is expected if pairs of species that cannot mate directly are able to exchange haplotypes via \u201cbridging\u201d species, resulting in extensive mating networks, as reported in tropical mangrove trees (Cer\u00f3n\u2010Souza et al., 2010). What we find instead is that several species\u2010rich tree genera appear to exchange haplotypes among species at a reduced frequency, perhaps because of the increased selective pressure against maladaptive hybridization when many congeners are present (i.e., reinforcement).",

Altogether, our findings suggest a link between intra\u2010 and interspecific diversity in tropical forests, with the presence of congeners generating increased intraspecific diversity through increased opportunities for hybridization and introgression. This particular effect of species diversity on genetic diversity had so far not been considered in efforts to conceptualize and explain biodiversity (cf. Vellend, 2005; Vellend & Geber, 2005). Given that introgression can facilitate the transfer of adaptive traits (Chapman & Abbott, 2010; Kim et al., 2008; Kim & Rieseberg, 1999; Martinsen, Whitham, Turek, & Keim, 2001; Whitney, Randell, & Rieseberg, 2010), an increase in baseline levels of genetic diversity through introgression should boost the potential for adaptation and diversification (Arnold, 1997; Field, Ayre, Whelan, & Young, 2008; Grant, 1981; Lewontin & Birch, 1966; Seehausen, 2004).",
