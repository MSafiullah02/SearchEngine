It has now evolved to become a global pandemic, involving multiple continents, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. 1 As of March 28, 2020, 512 701 cases have been reported globally; with 23 495 confirmed deaths. 2 Singapore was the first developed country outside of China to be affected by COVID-19, and up till February 19, 2020, was the country with the highest numbers of COVID-19 outside of China. 3 Although the epicenter of the global pandemic has now shifted to Europe and the United States, Singapore's ongoing efforts in disease containment has been successful in preventing the exponential rise in cases seen in other countries. This has been attributed to a multi-pronged comprehensive surveillance and containment system aimed at detecting as many cases as possible, such as through contact tracing of confirmed COVID-19 cases to halt the chain of transmission early on, and enhanced surveillance of selected patient groups (e.g. patients with pneumonia). [4] [5] As healthcare workers and spine surgeons at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country, we believe our experiences are unique. We aim to share some insights on these experiences and our management strategies by detailing: 1) Our role as spine surgeons in a major hospital at the frontlines of COVID-19; 2) Changes in spine surgery practice as a result of COVID-19 and management strategies; 3) The impact of COVID-19 on training and continuing medical education in spine surgery.",

We recognize that patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery often require a longer length of stay, high dependency support, and may cause strain on an already-stretched system. Our remaining elective surgical lists which were 50% of the norm comprised of patients who had severe pain or debilitating symptoms that were unable to wait for a later date. However, besides the cases that we postponed, many patients voluntarily cancelled their elective operations, likely due to uncertainty and fear of nosocomial infections. While these patients contributed to the drop in our caseload in the first month, many of them returned in the subsequent months after their symptoms prevailed. Our main challenges in prioritizing surgical cases were that of 1) Availability of peri-operative support, such as lack of autologous blood available for transfusion due to the drop in blood donations during the COVID-19 outbreak; and 2) Clinical urgency based on symptomology and disease severity. As a major tertiary trauma centre, we continued operating on emergency trauma and tumour cases. For elective cases, as far as possible, we prioritized performing minimally invasive surgery (MIS cases) and endoscopic cases as their shorter length of stay meant less strain on our hospital beds and healthcare resources. In the current climate of economic uncertainty, these measures will also allow us to keep healthcare costs down for patients, and for our nation. As a temporizing measure for pain relief, we also offered suitable patients the option of non-surgical measures such as nerve root injections, which are routinely done as day surgery and can be done under local anaesthesia, obliviating the need for anaesthetist support.",

This, along with the reduction of elective surgical cases, have undoubtedly affected residency training and residents' surgical logs. In such circumstances, there is a to balance the need to provide quality training to our residents while at the same time, prioritizing our commitment to fighting COVID-19 in the hospital's frontlines. Technological advancements have helped us ensure the learning of our residents and faculty is not neglected and we have successfully shifted our weekly residency teaching and selected CME programs to video-conferencing platforms. Residents and faculty are able to log on from their personal mobile devices or laptops. As compared to conventional lectures, we have received feedback that videoconferencing facilitates more interaction between the residents and the faculty conducting the session as it eliminates traditional boundaries of \"teacher versus students\" that a lecture theatre may have. In the realm of surgical training, while the case load has reduced, there is now more time available for each case as elective lists are not packed back to back. This gives residents more time for pre-operative case discussions, and as time constraints in the operating theatre are reduced, residents will be able to get more hands-on experience under faculty guidance. This will also allow increased time for peri-operative feedback, which has been shown to breed longer-lasting forms of learning and knowledge. 6",
