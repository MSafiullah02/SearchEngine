            "text": "The bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex remains a major economic problem for both beef and dairy cattle industries in North America, and throughout the world (Frank, 1989, Wittum et al., 1996). One of the clinically severest components of BRD is pneumonic pasteurellosis (shipping fever), which is characterized by acute lobar fibronecrotizing pleuropneumonia with extensive polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx and death within pulmonary alveoli (Slocombe et al., 1985, Leite et al., 1999). Mannheimia haemolytica A1 is the primary bacterial pathogen responsible for shipping fever (Yates, 1982, Gonzalez and Maheswaran, 1993). M. haemolytica produces several virulence factors, foremost of which is a leukotoxin (LKT), whose cytotoxic activity is specific for ruminant leukocytes and platelets (Gonzalez and Maheswaran, 1993). The LKT is a Ca2+-dependent pore-forming cytolysin, that is a member of the family of bacterial toxins designated RTX (repeats in toxin) (Welch, 1991). It has been reported that RTX toxins bind to \u03b22-integrins on target cells (Lally et al., 1997). M. haemolytica LKT was reported to bind to the \u03b22-integrin CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), or CD18 alone, on bovine leukocytes (Ambagala et al., 1999, Li et al., 1999, Jeyaseelan et al., 1999, Leite et al., 2000). This binding induces formation of pore-like structures in the plasma membrane, resulting in both activation of leukocytes, and death by apoptosis and necrosis (Stevens and Czuprynski, 1995, Stevens and Czuprynski, 1996, Wang et al., 1998, Sun et al., 1999, Clinkenbeard et al., 1994).",

The mechanism by which viral infection impairs resistance of cattle to pulmonary pasteurellosis has not been clearly elucidated. One mechanism that might be involved is the release of inflammatory cytokines during viral infection (Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985, Gonzalez and Maheswaran, 1993). These cytokines (i.e. IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) can activate bovine leukocytes and modulate the migration, and functional activation of \u03b22-integrins on bovine leukocytes (Nagahata et al., 1995).",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether BHV-1 infection increased CD11a/CD18 expression, LKT binding and LKT killing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood leukocytes in vitro.

All animals in the herd were tested monthly for antibody to BVH-1 and BVDV to ensure their viral-free status. One week before initiation of the experiment, all animals were tested and found to be free of detectable serum neutralizing antibodies to BHV-1. The animals were randomly assigned to two groups.

Briefly, M. haemolytica A1 was inoculated onto blood agar and incubated overnight (Remel, Lenexa, KS) at 37 \u00b0C. The bacteria were washed from the agar surface with 10 ml of brain heart infusion broth that contained 0.5% yeast extract (BHI/YE; Difco, Detroit, MI) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h while rotating (16 rpm) in 15 ml polypropylene tubes. A 10 ml aliquot of this suspension was then used to inoculate 200 ml of BHI/YE in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was then incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with gentle shaking. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation (1600\u00d7g for 15 min), resuspended in 200 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine (4.0 mM), and incubated on a shaker apparatus for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C.

Aliquots (20 ml) of crude leukotoxin were concentrated over an Amicon ultra filtration unit equipped with a 62 mm diameter XM-50 ultra filtration membrane. The volume was then reduced to 10\u201320 ml over a 1\u20132 h period by applying 60 psi transmembrane pressure with nitrogen gas. The partially purified leukotoxin preparation that remained was collected and stored as 5 ml aliquots at \u221270 \u00b0C. Leukotoxic activity was confirmed by Trypan blue exclusion, using bovine peripheral blood leukocytes incubated with serial dilutions of toxin for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. One unit of LKT activity was defined as the dilution causing 50% killing of bovine peripheral blood leukocytes as determined by Trypan blue exclusion.

We recovered greatly increased number of BAL from the BHV-1 infected cattle, with alveolar macrophages and other mononuclear cells being the most prominent cell populations as reported previously (Foreman et al., 1981). The presence of more LKT-responsive cells in the lungs of BHV-1 infected cattle could play an important role in the pathogenesis of pasteurellosis. LKT-mediated activation and death of increased number of BAL would corroborate with the intense lung inflammation and damage noted in pasteurellosis (Slocombe et al., 1985, Wittum et al., 1996). It is presumed that the inflammatory process elicited by BHV-1 infection results in secretion of cytokines locally and into the systemic circulation (Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985, Yoo et al., 1995). These inflammatory cytokines would induce increased expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells resulting in increased migration and functional activation of \u03b22-integrins on leukocytes in the lung (Arnaout, 1990, Williams and Solomkin, 1999).",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited a slight increase in LKT binding at day 5 post-infection (P>0.05), whereas PMNs exhibited increased CD11a/CD18 expression and increased LKT binding at 5 and 7 days post-infection (P<0.05). These observations support the previously reported association between LFA-1 expression, and the binding and cytotoxic activity of LKT for bovine peripheral blood leukocytes (Ambagala et al., 1999, Li et al., 1999, Jeyaseelan et al., 1999, Leite et al., 2000). We believe it is likely that the increased CD11a/CD18 expression by PMNs from BHV-1 infected cattle is mediated by inflammatory cytokines secreted during viral infection, rather than the direct effects of the virus. This supposition is based on reports that productive infection by BHV-1 does not occur in bovine peripheral blood leukocytes (Foreman et al., 1982a, Foreman et al., 1982b). We have previously reported that bovine PMNs stimulated with IL-1\u03b2 in vitro increased CD11a/CD18 expression, LKT binding and cytotoxicity (Leite et al., 2000). These latter effects were inhibited by addition of the same BAT75 anti-CD11a/CD18 mAb used in the present study. The BAT75 mAb is reported to bind to both CD11a and CD18, although the precise binding site has not been determined. As a result, our results do not allow us to exclude the possible contributions of other \u03b22-integrins (i.e. CD11b/CD18) in our flow cytometry studies. Recently, we have obtained preliminary data indicating that incubation of bovine PMNs with other cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) also upregulates CD11a/CD18, and LKT binding and killing (unpublished observations).",

            "text": "Bovine lung leukocytes constitutively expressed \u03b22-integrins; the mAb (BAT75A) used in this study recognized nearly all BAL cells from both BHV-1 infected and uninfected cattle (Leite et al., 2000). Nor did we observe differences in the intensity of CD11a/CD18 expression by BAL cells from BHV-1 infected or control cattle (Fig. 2A). In contrast, we observed a significant increase in LKT binding (Fig. 3), and LKT mediated killing (Fig. 4), of BAL from BHV-1 infected cattle. Stimulation of leukocytes can lead to conformational changes in the \u03b22-integrin molecules that result in increased receptor affinity, rather than increased receptor number (Hibbs et al., 1991, Barnett et al., 1998). Thus, one possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between increased LKT binding to BAL, without increased CD11a/CD18 expression, is that the inflammatory process in the BHV-1 infected lung stimulated a conformational change in CD11a/CD18 that increased its affinity for LKT. We have previously reported that RGD peptides block the binding of LKT to resting, but not IL-1\u03b2 stimulated, bovine PMNs (Leite et al., 2000). This prior observation is also consistent with the inference that CD11a/CD18 on stimulated bovine leukocytes has an increased affinity for LKT. However, we cannot have the possibility that the mAb (BAT75A) recognize other \u03b22-integrins on leukocytes that do not play a role as a receptor to LKT, or that BAL cells possess an additional LKT receptor, besides CD11a/CD18.",

            "text": "There are some limitations in our study. First, we used only one mAb (BAT75A) to evaluate CD11a/CD18 expression. The binding site for this mAb has not been fully characterized. Thus, it is possible it might bind to other members of the \u03b22-integrin family. A second limitation is that we did not distinguish which peripheral blood cell population was most susceptible to the action of LKT, since we did not separate these cells into PMN and PBMC enriched populations before assessing cytotoxicity. Although the method used to assess cytotoxicity (Trypan blue exclusion) is tedious and more subjective than some assays, it has been used by our laboratory and others to determine cell viability, and offers relatively rapid results as compared to other methods (i.e. color development in MTT or XTT assays). One final limitation of our study was the day that we chose to perform the BAL (day 4 post-infection). This time was chosen because some previous reports suggested that it fell within the window of increased susceptibility to pasteurellosis (Yates, 1982). However, we observed an increase in CD11a/CD18 expression and LKT binding to PMNs on day 5 and 7 post-infection, suggesting that, ideally, BAL would be performed more than once after infection (i.e. 3\u20137 days post-infection). However, we were concerned that performing BAL more than once on the same animal would confound our analyses. Financial constraints prevented us from adding more animals that would have allowed us to sample BAL, at more than one time point, without lavaging any animal more than once.",
