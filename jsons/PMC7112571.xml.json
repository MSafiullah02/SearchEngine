Coronavirus was identified as the etiologic agent of SARS [1], [2]. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a positive strand RNA virus. The plasmid of SARS-CoV includes six kinds of proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membranes (M), small envelope (E), polymerase and 3c like (3CL) hydrolytic protease. There are 18 complete genome sequences from different resources that have been determined. Sequence analysis show these genomes are different but not too much, especially its main protease, the 3CL protease(3CLpro) is relatively conserved in the SARS genome and thus can be taken as one of the key targets for anti-SARS drug design [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].",

In SARS-CoV the nonstructural gene (namely the enzyme copy gene) code for two overlapped polypeptides: pp1a (486 kDa) and ORF1b (790 kDa). They conduct almost all functions needed during the course of virus replication as well as transcription. Polypeptides with different functions are mostly produced from these two polypeptides and this kind of crack procedure is just mainly dependent on the 3CLpro\n[3], [4]. The catalytically active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro has been shown to be Cys145/His41 [2], [6], [7], which is conserved in this protein. Therefore, designing drugs for this 3CLpro should inhibit SARS infection effectively.",

POMs perform significant biological activities, with high efficacy and low toxicity. In particular, the sizes and globular structural motifs of many POMs are similar, and in some cases nearly identical to some water-soluble fullerene derivatives showing fairly good anti-HIV-1P activity [11]. Liu and her co-workers have investigated POMs compounds such as PW, SiW, PMo, and SiMo. Their results show that some POMs possess lower cell virulence and higher anti-HIV activity [8], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",

Many papers report that Ti-containing \u03b1-Keggin POMs show obvious inhibition activity to HIV-1 [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. It is very significant to explore the inhibition potency of \u03b1-Keggin POMs to SARS-CoV. Firstly, whether POMs interact with the SARS main functional protease of 3CLpro; secondly, what the interaction mechanism should be; and above all, it is of great significance to explore molecular mechanism and molecular dynamics mechanism when studying problems related to POMs. In this investigation, the \u03b1-Keggin type POM isomers including [\u03b1-1,5-PTi2W10O40]7\u2212, [\u03b1-1,6-PTi2W10O40]7\u2212, [\u03b1-1,11-PTi2W10O40]7\u2212, [\u03b1-1,4-PTi2W10O40]7\u2212, [\u03b1-1,2-PTi2W10O40]7\u2212 were selected as candidates for SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. Binding energy was compared, hydrogen bonds formation and electrostatic interaction were analyzed, active site key residues were identified and the interaction mechanism was also discussed at molecular level.",

However, the general interaction position of POMs with 3CLpro should not change because it was based on energy difference instead of the absolute values. An assumption made in this study was that neither the enzyme nor the inhibitors undergo major structural changes on binding. The five POMs of 1,5-PTi2, 1,6-PTi2, 1,11-PTi2, 1,4-PTi2, and 1,2-PTi2 were docked respectively in the active site of SARS 3CLpro.

Where \u201c\u0394\u201d represents energy difference originated from steric hindrance between POMs and 3CLpro, \u201c\u0394\n1\u201d represents electrostatic energy changing of the complex, and \u201c\u0394\n2\u201d is the total energy changing. As is shown in the results that, for all these five ligand\u2013receptor complexes, the electrostatic energy (\u0394\n1) both decrease remarkably, which indicates that the highly negative charged POM inhibitors interact with the 3CLpro and therefore cause electrostatic energy to decrease. Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction is strong enough to overcome the unfavorable steric effects, therefore results in total negative energy (\u0394\n2) in all the five complexes. Binding energy is an important criterion for reliable virtual screening. Several researches have performed virtual screening study of SARS-CoV 3CLpro using small molecular like AG7088 as reference molecule [35], [36]. As is shown in our investigation that, binding energy of POM/3CLpro complex is much higher than that of some small organic molecules. This indicates that POMs may even more prone to bind with 3CLpro than small organic molecules. What is more, an important conclusion can be drawn from our study is that, the total binding energies of the five complex systems follow the order of 1,2-PTi2/3CLpro\n > 1,4-PTi2/3CLpro\n > 1,5-PTi2/3CLpro\n > 1,6-PTi2/3CLpro\n > 1,11-PTi2/3CLpro, which can provide perfectly well interpretation on the relative stability of the five POM/3CLpro complexes.",

Moreover, it is clearly shown that the OTi2of POMs contributes much to hydrogen bond formation within all the five ligand-receptor complexes. Our former DFT calculation have shown that in these POM isomers, the charge loading of OTi2 is much stronger than that of other bridging oxygen and terminal oxygen. That should be the reason why the two systems of the 1,2-PTi2/3CLpro complexes and the 1,4-PTi2/3CLpro complex are much more stable than the others. It should be noticed that there are only six hydrogen bonds in 1,11-PTi2/3CLpro and the terminal oxygen also attends hydrogen bonds formation. Our quantum chemistry calculation also proved that the charge loading of the terminal oxygen is smaller than that of OW2. Therefore, it is easy to interpret why the complex of 1,11-PTi2/3CLpro is the least stable one among all the five ligand\u2013receptor complex systems.",

Therefore, the atom charge loading property and the electrostatic characteristic are two vital elements keeping POM/3CLpro complex stable and deserve paying much more attention when consider POMs/enzyme interactions. POMs interact with 3CLpro in the active site region with obvious electrostatic property compensation adjustment, accordingly it may preclude the hydrolysis of the two polypeptides expressed by SARS virus, and therefore may cut off the approach of virus replication.
