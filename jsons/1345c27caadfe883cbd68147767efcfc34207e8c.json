Individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk in the bid to adhere to the call by government officials and experts. As a result, the existence of relationship between the preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. This study evaluates the behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures) proposed by public health experts for COVID-19 which had altered human behavior and their day to day lives. The dynamics underlying the mitigation and suppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and significantly interfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all the measures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate. However, the mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of the transmission which might lead to a severe economic meltdown, yet, a combination of the measures show a possibility of rooting out transmission within 30 days if adhered to in an extreme manner. The result shows a peak period of infection for Ghana ranges from 64 th day to 74 th day of infection time period.",

            "text": "Late December 2019, China reported and confirmed a new pneumonia case caused by a virus called novel corona virus, or SARS-COV-2 (named COVID-19 disease by WHO) within the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province. The virus spread rapidly from 41 confirmed cases to 5,974 within 18 days (10-28 January, 2020), surpassing the SARS pandemic flu. By 4 th April 2020, COVID-19 had spread to 201 countries/regions across every continent, threatening overwhelming the health-care systems of several countries and threatening to ground global economy. There has been 1,681,954 reported cases with 102,026 deaths as at 10 th April 2020 (23:58 GMT), and 228,923 recovered. Active cases stood at 810,351 persons worldwide (Worldometers, 2020) . China, the epicenter of the pandemic has been surpassed by USA (491, 358 cases, 18, 316 deaths) , Italy (119,827 cases, 14,681 deaths), Spain (119, 199 cases, 11, 198 deaths) , Germany (91,159 cases, 1,275 deaths). In Africa, South Africa is leading with 2,173 cases, 25 deaths, followed by Egypt (2,065 cases, 159 deaths), Algeria (1,914 cases, 293 deaths), Morocco (1,746 cases, 120 deaths), Cameroon (820 cases, 12 deaths), Tunisia (707 cases, 31 deaths), Ivory Coast (566 cases, 5 deaths) and Ghana (566 cases, 8 deaths) as 13 th April, 2020 , 11:48 GMT (Worldometers, 2020 . The severity of transmission appears to be broader than previously thought with the pandemic spreading quickly across the world within a short time and its virulence has been estimated to be high, but, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions experiencing higher mortality rates (Neil M. F., Laydon D., Gemma N-G. et al., 2020) . The early stages of the transmission posed challenges for estimating the transmission dynamics of the infection (Funk S., Ciglenecki I., Tiffany .A, et al., 2017) , ). However, recovery over weeks has provided insight into the epidemiological situation and has helped identify whether mitigation and suppression strategies are having desired effects in the populations (Riley S., Fraser C., Donnelly C.A., et al., 2003) . The insight elicited can be used to inform prediction of distribution patterns (Viboud C., Sun K., Gaffey R., et al. , 2018) , and estimation of risk in other countries (Cooper B.S., Pitman R.J., Edmunds W.J., et al., 2006) . It would also help in the design of alternative non-pharmaceutical interventions (Kucharski A.J., Camacho A., Checchi F, et al., 2015) .",

This is necessary given the dire state of the health-care facility in Ghana and its gross inadequacy to provide the required services needed in the event of a major outbreak. The uncertainties of the effectiveness of mitigation measures notwithstanding, it provides the surest way to prevent an escalation of COVID-19 cases in Ghana when coupled with individual measures such as cleaning of hands with soaps under running water, avoidance of crowded spaces, avoidance of traditional hand greetings and the use of hand sanitizers as well as staying home.

The outcome shows effectiveness of mitigation and suppression measures to flatten the transmission curve, even though the 30-day projections seems encouraging for declining projected transmission number, an ideal situation is a 3-4 months suppression measures in order to control the epidemic (Stephanie Soucheray, 2020). The estimated projections for combination of measures and within time frame is consistent with the practice in China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan which have recorded cases below that predicted by experts (Xiuli Liu, Geoffrey Hewings, Shouyang Wang , Minghui Qin, Xin Xiang, Shan Zheng, Xuefeng, 2020). It should be pointed out that , the estimations are in line with projections by experts in UK and goes on to confirm the possibility of adopting these measures in order to defeat the virulent transmission of COVID-19 (Neil M F, Laydon D, Gemma N-G etl al, 2020) .",

            "text": "To large extent, population wide social distancing within the entire country would have had the largest impact to control the virus transmission and bring the basic reproduction number less than 1, thereby rapidly reducing the case incidence within the population. Even though, the results show a possible control of COVID-19 within 30 days, to avoid re-insurgence due to reinfection, the measures need to stay longer to eliminate the transmission completely. As argued out by Neil M F, Laydon D, Gemma N-G et al. (2020) Ghana as a developing country cannot as a feasible policy sustain prolonged suppression measures due to the economic impact it might have and a possible recession halting the rebound of the national economy, a 3-4 months suppression with intermittent relaxation when improvement is realized is the viable option whiles waiting for a pharmaceutical intervention such as vaccine is developed.\\\\\\\\ Several limitation to the present study exist. Firstly, the study relies on published information on the ongoing crisis, though, no country or study has been able to put out the full picture or understands the transmission completely. This information are based on the decisions made by the organizations or government agencies that put out the information. Secondary, the study did not take into consideration the effect of high temperature had on the transmission level, as Ghana is a tropical country with high temperatures known to be far higher than what experts say the virus could survive under (Fauci, 2020) . Finally, the study uses growth rate which have been recorded at the early stage of transmission subject to intrinsic and extrinsic health factors in the various countries where the cases were imported from. Whiles we acknowledge these limitations, we believe the current study throws more light on possible impacts of the interventions and feasibility of projections given data availability. ",
