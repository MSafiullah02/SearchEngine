Additionally, EMMPRIN is now appreciated to have multiple roles apart from MMP induction, including in cellular functions, such as migration, adhesion, invasion, energy metabolism, as well as T cell activation and proliferation.

Glycosylation patterns may vary in different organs or cell types [3] [4] [5] and may be a reason for its multiple physiologic roles. The structure of EMMPRIN consists of a heavily glycosylated EC domain, a TM domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1) . There are 4 isoforms of EMMPRIN that differ only in its EC domain [6, 7] . The EC domain of the most prominent isoform, basigin-2 and here forward called EMMPRIN, is comprised of 2 Ig-like loops (EC1 and EC2) held together by disulfide bonds (Fig. 1) . Sequence analyses and the crystal structure of EMMPRIN demonstrated that the EC1, the more N-terminal portion, structurally resembles the b-strand pattern of the C region of Igs, particularly the C2-set fold, a subclass that has some structural features of the V region of Igs in addition to the C region. EC2, the C-terminal loop, is slightly longer and showed strong homology to the V region of Igs, thus termed as a shortened V-set fold or an I-set [8, 9] . EMMPRIN is unique among Igs, as its EC2 domain has a high degree of homology to the V region of Igs as well as the MHCII b chain that contains a C region. For this reason, it is suggested that the EMMPRIN Ig domain may be a primordial form of the Ig superfamily [9, 10] . The C2-V/I arrangement of the EC portion of EMMPRIN is also distinctive among Igs, as most follow a V/I-C arrangement and undergo V-V or I-I dimerization [8] . Instead, the EC domain of EMMPRIN appears to undergo C2-C2 or C2-V/I dimerization based on the crystal structure [8] . As inferred, the Ig superfamily, which encompass the most diverse group of receptors known, contains domains that share evolutionary homology and are identified to be associated with functions, such as adhesion, migration, cell recognition, and T cell activation [11, 12] , which EMMPRIN clearly exemplifies (as mentioned below). The complexity of EMMPRIN, in terms of its various glycosylation patterns, and types of homo/heterophilic interactions between domains all contribute to its multifunctional nature. A rare isoform also exists, expressed only in the retina, comprised of 3 Ig-like loops and named basigin-1 [13] . Other rare and less understood variants include basigin-3 and -4, both comprising only 1 Ig-like loop in which the EC domain of basigin-4 is slightly extended from that of basigin-3 [6] . Interestingly, basigin-3 was found to act as an inhibitor of EMMPRIN (basigin-2) likely by hetero-oligomerization [7] . This was demonstrated in HCC cells, where in contrast to basigin-2, basigin-3 overexpression inhibited cellular proliferation, MMP induction, and invasion [7] . A highly conserved glutamic acid residue and leucine zipper are found in the TM domain and hypothesized to interact with a number of yet-unidentified proteins in the plasma membrane. Although the cytoplasmic tail is short (only ;40 aa), this does not rule out the involvement of EMMPRIN in the initiation of various signaling pathways, even as a coreceptor. The TM and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved among species [14] , thus emphasizing a critical, functional role in this region of EMMPRIN. A 22 kDa soluble form of EMMPRIN can be shed from the cell surface by MMP-14, cleaving off the first Ig-like domain [15] . In addition, full-length EMMPRIN can be released by cells via microvesicle shedding, an efficient vehicle to elicit communication between cells [16, 17] . It is reasoned that the outward budding of EMMPRIN-containing microvesicles from the plasma membrane of tumor cells shortly after breaks apart, giving rise to membrane fragment-associated EMMPRIN in the EC space; it is this soluble form (not the microvesicle-associated form) that primarily induced MMP activities in stromal cells [16] . Since then, studies have described the involvement of EMMPRIN-containing microvesicles in aspects, such as angiogenesis [18] and the migration and invasion of cancer cells [19, 20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 160, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 229, "end": 232, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 233, "end": 236, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 487, "end": 490, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 491, "end": 493, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1129, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1132, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1400, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1404, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1564, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1683, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1953, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1957, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2308, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2496, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2616, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2777, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3208, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3399, "end": 3403, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3550, "end": 3554, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3555, "end": 3558, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3892, "end": 3896, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 4019, "end": 4023, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4071, "end": 4075, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4076, "end": 4079, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 410, "end": 418, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 663, "end": 671, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EMMPRIN STRUCTURE AND BINDING PARTNERS"}, {"text": "Each domain of EMMPRIN has been identified to interact with different proteins and correspond to particular functions, such that mAbs toward EMMPRIN may alter 1 function without affecting another. Importantly, N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues and homophilic interactions is significant for the function and protein interactions of EMMPRIN [3, 4, 8] ; this was demonstrated when purified, deglycosylated EMMPRIN failed to induce MMP-1 and MMP-2 activity in tumor cells [5] . The EC1 domain of EMMPRIN is important in MMP induction (MMP-1, -2, -3, and -9, as well as MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP), oligomerization, the binding of integrins, and likely CD98 (a single TM glycoprotein involved in adhesion and amino acid transport; Fig. 1 ) [14, 21] . The EC2 domain has been described to bind cyclophilins (important in chemotaxis and adhesion) [14] and caveolin-1 (a negative regulator that binds EMMPRIN at its low glycosylated form, preventing its glycosylation and clustering at the cell surface; Fig. 1 ) [4] . The TM domain binds cyclophilin 60 (serving to chaperone EMMPRIN up to the cell surface) [22] and likely involves interactions with CD43 (an adhesion molecule) [23] , syndecan-1 (a HSPG involved in adhesion) [24] , and b1 integrins [14] (Fig. 1) . Lastly, both the TM and the cytoplasmic domain of EMMPRIN interact with MCTs [25] , such as MCT1 or MCT4 (both widely expressed) or MCT3 (predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium). EMMPRIN shuttles MCTs to the plasma membrane, where it plays essential metabolic roles through the transport of monocarboxylates, such as pyruvate and lactate [2, 14] (Fig. 1) . Other EMMPRINinteracting proteins include glycoprotein VI (involved in platelet rolling) [26] , annexin II (implicated in cytoskeleton rearrangement) [27] , shrew1 (influencing cell invasiveness) [28] , and the g-secretase complex (implicated in Alzheimer's disease in the production of amyloid b peptides) [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 356, "end": 358, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 359, "end": 361, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 481, "end": 484, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 846, "end": 850, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1014, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1181, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1229, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1253, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1346, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1625, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1629, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1734, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1795, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1841, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1952, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 732, "end": 738, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1008, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1262, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1638, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EMMPRIN STRUCTURE AND BINDING PARTNERS"}, {"text": "To understand EMMPRIN function, EMMPRIN knockout mice had been generated.

The kidney also has high expression levels, as does the testis correlating to its involvement in spermatogenesis [7] . Of the hematopoietic cells, EMMPRIN is expressed on all leukocytes (monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes) [37] , erythrocytes [38] , and platelets [39] .

Furthermore, the labeling with FoxP3, a well-known intracellular T reg marker, and EMMPRIN enables the identification of 3 distinct populations: 1) EMMPRIN low FoxP3 + cells representing rT regs ; 2) EMMPRIN medium FoxP3 + cells, representing T regs that can produce cytokines (reviewed in ref.

The first stage of development can be separated into 4 DN phases, distinguished by CD25 and CD44 expression ( Fig. 2A) . Here, the TCR-b chain is tested for functionality, and a dramatic expansion of functional pre-TCRs ensues, marking the end of the DN phase.

These results were corroborated by the newly generated EMMPRIN-floxed mice, where EMMPRIN was conditionally ablated in T cells by use of the Lck-cre promoter [46] .

It was demonstrated that EMMPRIN negatively regulates/inhibits T cell proliferation in a MLR, where splenocytes from EMMPRIN 2/2 animals exhibited an enhanced, proliferative response compared with wild-type splenocytes when cocultured with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes [30] . A similar response was observed in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated, EMMPRIN 2/2 T cells from Lck-Cre; Figure 2 . The role of EMMPRIN in T cell biology. EMMPRIN is involved in T cell development, activation, proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and energy metabolism. It is highly expressed in thymocytes during T cell development, playing a role in the transition phase from DN3 to DN4, where a proliferative burst occurs (A). In the periphery, EMMPRIN expression levels are low and localize to the immune synapse upon TCR-mediated T cell activation. TCR-MHC engagement leads to the up-regulation of CD40 ligand (CD40L; Signal 1), allowing for B7-CD28 costimulation (Signal 2). APCs also express EMMPRIN, where it may act as an alternate costimulator to provide \"Signal 2\" for T cell activation. EMMPRIN interacts with a number of molecules regulating adhesion (see Fig. 3 ), which could play a role in immune synapse formation (B). Once T cells are activated, EMMPRIN levels are up-regulated and involved in a number of actions (C; see text for further details).

It is suggested that anti-EMMPRIN antibodies may be acting as agonists, mimicking ligand engagement [51, 52] . Interestingly, EMMPRIN 2/2 T cells or anti-EMMPRIN antibodies only altered the proliferation of T cells when stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and not with PMA/ ionomycin (a stimulant that bypasses the need for surface receptors). This implies that EMMPRIN is involved at the very early stages of T cell activation involving TCRs or costimulators [46, 51] . Minutes after TCR-dependent activation, EMMPRIN aggregates to immune synapses ( Fig. 2B) , an area formed upon T cell activation that is densely packed with receptors and signaling molecules pivotal in initiating T cell activation. EMMPRIN colocalized with immune synapse markers, including CD4, CD8, CD48, and GM1 [51, 52] , whereas the presence of anti-EMMPRIN antibodies (both clone MEM-M6/6 and 5A12) altered the formation of these immune synapses [51, 52] . Administration of the MEM-M6/6 clone upon TCR-mediated activation displaced the T cell coreceptors CD48 and CD59 from lipid rafts, leading to reduced expression of the T cell activation marker CD25 and hence, reduced T cell proliferation. Transcripts for IFN-g, IL-15, IL-4, and IL-10, among other cytokines (12 hours after activation), were also diminished. However, not all microdomains were affected by this antibody, as the distribution pattern of Lck did not change nor did tyrosine phosphorylation levels (5 minutes after activation), as well as IL-2 levels (24 hours after activation) [51] . Another EMMPRIN antibody, 5A12 clone (which docks to the EC1 domain of EMMPRIN), had similar and contrasting effects from that of the MEM-M6/6 clone (which recognizes the EC2 domain) upon TCR-mediated activation of human T cells. The 5A12 clone demonstrated reduced CD25 and IL-4 protein levels; however, the 5A12 clone also decreased tyrosine phosphorylation (2 hours after activation), EC calcium influx, and IL-2 protein levels, in addition to increased IFN-g protein levels (72 hours after activation) [52] . The differences in antibody responses could be a result of differences in experimental methods (e.g., the time analyzed after T cell activation) or perhaps a result of the different functional domains/epitopes of EMMPRIN that the antibodies recognize and to which they bind ( Table 1) . If these antibodies act as agonists, this suggests that the inhibitory effect of EMMPRIN upon TCR-dependent activation works to trigger the dissociation of certain molecules from microdomains to help shut down T cell responses. The mechanism behind the involvement of EMMPRIN in T cell activation still needs to be defined clearly. mAbs toward EMMPRIN demonstrate additional differences. In the mouse, the anti-EMMPRIN mAb (RL73.2 clone) was able to inhibit the migration of T cells and monocytes toward CyPA and reduce disease severity of mouse models of RA and lung inflammation (see section below) [61] [62] [63] ; however, the antibody was unable to inhibit the proliferation of MOG-primed T cells [64] or inhibit the release of MMP-9 in a coculture of fibroblasts and mouse macrophages. In contrast, the anti-EMMPRIN clone UM-8D6 was able to inhibit MMP-9 secretion by 90% [61] . A novel anti-EMMPRIN antibody, clone 10, suppressed EAE disease activity and inhibited T cell proliferation, as well as MMP-9 production [53] . It was also observed that EMMPRIN mAbs, which induced cell aggregation (e.g., M6-1F3) of U937 cells, were not able to inhibit cell proliferation of human T cells and vice versa (e.g., M6-1B9) [54] .

T cell activation and proliferation require an initiation event (Signal 1, provided by TCR engagement) and a costimulatory event (Signal 2; Fig. 2B ). Studies suggest that EMMPRIN expression on APCs, rather than on T cells, may be what is important in allowing for T cells to proliferate [58, 67, 68] . This was demonstrated when \"Signal 1\" provided by anti-CD3 stimulation did not proliferate T cells when mixed with irradiated Signal 2-supplying U937 cells, prepulsed with an anti-EMMPRIN antibody (clone HI197). U937 cells are a human monoblastoid cell line that lacks B7 (Fig. 2B) ; thus, they depend on alternate costimulatory pathways to provide Signal 2 [58] . This result was confirmed by identifying EMMPRIN as one of the candidate genes involved in Chinese hamster ovary [67] or dendritic cell [68] -mediated costimulation of T cells. This implicates that EMMPRIN on APCs, and not T cells, may be acting as an important costimulatory molecule for T cell activation. Yet, studies have also demonstrated proliferative inhibition by anti-EMMPRIN antibodies (by use of clone 5A12 and MEM-M6/6) on purified T cells, as well as PBMCs [51, 52] .

In erythrocytes, EMMPRIN appears to function as an adhesion molecule, as administration of F(ab9) 2 fragments of the anti-EMMPRIN antibody (clone RL73.2) inhibited the migration of murine erythrocytes out of the spleen and into the circulation causing anemia [38] . In platelets, EMMPRIN interactions were shown to be involved in their rolling [39] . Likewise, in Jurkat cells, a T-lymphoma cell line, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EMMPRIN reduced their adhesion to fibronectin [77] . It is noteworthy that EMMPRIN oligomerization is important in increasing the avidity of EMMPRIN interactions with other molecules and with itself for its various functional purposes (Fig.  3A ) [3, 5, 66, 75] . Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated the interaction of EMMPRIN (likely in a lateral fashion) with a 3 b 1 and a 6 b 1 integrins but not a 2 b 1 or a 5 b 1 integrins in the membrane at sites of cell-cell contact in cell lines [78] (Fig. 3B) . CyPB, an EMMPRIN ligand, along with glycosaminoglycans, was shown to play a role in the adhesion of human PBMCs (mainly of the CD4 + CD45RO + phenotype) to the ECM [79] . Furthermore, syndecan-1, a HSPG present on the cell surface of T cells, also associates with EMMPRIN (likely in the TM region) and is involved in adhesion to fibronectin via CyPB-induced MAPK activation [24] (Fig. 3C) . Another report identified EMMPRIN in a complex with CD98, b1 integrins, and CyPB in a human promonocytic leukemia THP-1 cell line that mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin [81] (Fig. 3D) . The binding of CyPB is thought to catalyze peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity in EMMPRIN, triggering intracellular signaling events that induce cell aggregation or integrin-mediated adhesion through a PI3K-protein kinase Cd-MAPK pathway. It is proposed that CD98 can regulate b1 integrin affinity and was reported to coimmunoprecipitate with a 4 b 1 integrins in PBMCs [81] . Hyaluronan-CD44-MCT-EMMPRIN complexes were also shown to exist in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines [83] (Fig. 3G) . Besides its metabolic roles, in T cells, the best established function of CD44 is its adhesive capabilities [86] . In addition, the presence of a mAb toward EMMPRIN (clone 10) on activated human PBMCs was reported to reduce a4 integrin and NF-kB signaling, leaving Akt and MAPK signaling unaffected, and clone 10 decreased T cell adhesion to endothelial cells [66] . The addition of various EMMPRIN mAbs alone to the U937 monocytic cell line would initiate homotypic cell aggregation via LFA-1, a b2 integrin [54, 87] . In the human Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line, EMMPRIN mAbs (MEM-M6/8 and/or HAb18) also induced homotypic aggregation [23, 59] and adhesion to the LFA-1 ligand, ICAM-1; this adhesion was also regulated by the presence of CD43 [23] . All 3 adhesion molecules, CD18 (representing LFA-1), CD43, and EMMPRIN, colocalized together at sites of cell-cell contact; however, 2 distinct CD43 complexes with EMMPRIN or LFA-1 existed based on coimmunoprecipitation experiments [23] (Fig. 3F ). CD43 is a sialoglycoprotein that is highly glycosylated containing a net negative charge; thus, it likely is able to repulse cell contacts, which is important for cell migration, but can still permit cell contacts in the first place. It is probable that CD43 interactions with EMMPRIN or LFA-1 may inhibit their adhesive capabilities. Moreover, it was shown recently that in the presence of an anti-EMMPRIN antibody (HAb18), alone, in Jurkat cells or CD4 + primary cells, cell aggregation increased with time, whereas CyPA-induced chemotaxis decreased; these results imply a functional trade-off for EMMPRIN [59] . Interestingly, knocking down EMMPRIN in Jurkat cells by RNA interference also induced cell aggregation and decreased levels of CD98 [59] . This is surprising, as EMMPRIN and CD98 are thought to mediate adhesion. Clearly, EMMPRIN and CD98 expression levels are linked. It is speculated that EMMPRIN may inhibit cell aggregation and that the addition of an anti-EMMPRIN antibody may work to inhibit EMMPRIN in carrying out this particular negative role (thus acting as an antagonist instead of an agonist) [59] .

The silencing of EMMPRIN in Jurkat cells decreased its proliferation, migration, and adhesion to fibronectin; this emphasizes the importance of EMMPRIN in the survival and growth of cancer cells. As noted before, the absence of EMMPRIN in primary T cells led to their hyperproliferation [30, 46, 50] . The contradictory results can be explained by the proliferation of cancer cells acting through a mechanism not dependent on TCR-mediated signaling events, as is the case in primary T cells. When Jurkat cells were cocultured with superantigen-loaded Raji B cells, thus subjected to conjugate formation, EMMPRIN aggregated at T cell immune synapses. When Jurkat cells were also stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies to initiate TCR-dependent signaling events, contrary to TCRindependent mechanisms [77] , EMMPRIN overexpression inhibited T cell activity, as demonstrated by NFAT inhibition (an essential transcription factor in T cell activation), whereas EMMPRIN knockdown promoted NFAT signaling activity (events umpired by the intracellular domain of EMMPRIN) [104] . The inhibitory effect of EMMPRIN on TCR-mediated activation in Jurkat cells occurred downstream of the Vav1 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) signaling pathway and upstream of the JNK and serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 pathway; ERK signaling remained unaffected. Besides signaling, functional activities, such as proliferation, however, was not assessed [104] . This supports that TCR-mediated activation brings out a regulatory/ inhibitory effect of EMMPRIN at the early stages of T cell activity. However, in TCR-independent activation/proliferation, as found in cancer cells (such as lymphomas) or in activated autoimmune T cells (such as in SLE), EMMPRIN (highly up-regulated compared with resting primary T cells) may act in a positive or stimulatory manner for activities, such as adhesion, invasion, migration, or aiding, in the Warburg effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 125, "text": "[77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 126, "end": 130, "text": "104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 425, "end": 428, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1199, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1616, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cancer/lymphoma"}, {"text": "SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease associated with abnormal T and B cell functions leading to the dysfunction of a number of organs [105] .

T cell-mediated inflammation relies on a cascade of events, including its development, activation, proliferation, migration, and adhesion; all of these steps have been shown to be influenced by EMMPRIN in complex ways ( Table 2) . Administration of most mAbs dampens these T cell functional responses (Tables 1 and 2 ), in which different EMMPRIN antibodies may target specific T cell activities, likely depending on its recognized epitope (e.g., antibodies that inhibited T cell proliferation did not induce cell aggregation and vice versa; Table 1 ) [54] .

On the other hand, the application of EMMPRIN mAbs decreased TCR-mediated proliferation ( Table 2 ); this indicates that these antibodies work in an agonistic fashion for that particular task. Alternatively, the reduction of EMMPRIN expression by RNA interference in cancer cells or the application of EMMPRIN mAbs led to a reduction in migration, adhesion, energy metabolism, and proliferation (via TCR-independent mechanisms) yet an increase in cell aggregation. This likely demonstrates that EMMPRIN works to promote the migration, adhesion, and energy metabolism of cells and TCR-independent proliferation of cancer cells but functions to impede cell aggregation.

Thus, antibody affinity also plays a role in functionality. Differences in antibody responses could be a result of a number of reasons. For example, as mentioned before, disparity in epitope recognition, antibody affinity, and the density of EMMPRIN on the cell surface could all influence antibody functionality. How the structure of EMMPRIN may be oriented upon binding with various interacting partners may also have an influence; there is a flexible linker between the EC1 and EC2 domain of EMMPRIN, allowing for conformational changes [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 930, "end": 933, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 174, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 378, "end": 387, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "CONCLUDING REMARKS"}, {"text": "The observation that EMMPRIN seems to exhibit functional duality in T cells is not clearly understood.

One reconciling factor for the positive or negative effects of EMMPRIN on T cells appears to be its levels on these leukocytes; when levels of EMMPRIN are high, such as in thymocytes or on T cells in the periphery during disease states, EMMPRIN facilitates several T cell phenotypes (Table 2 ).
