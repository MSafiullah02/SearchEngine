Since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China and its rapid spread to other countries, as of April 27 2020, there were about 3 million cases with over 190000 deaths worldwide. However, actual situation might be even more dire, since such statistics likely do not fully display the entire impact of COVID-19, especially with regard to its influence on patients with a history of stroke who need to take cardiovascular drugs regularly to prevent recurrent vascular events. Although there is currently a lack of definitive data, it is conceivable that several of these patients are unable to receive their cardiovascular preventive medications, especially if they live in most COVID-19 ravaged areas with medical systems overwhelmed, and/or are restricted to their homes.",

Clinical trial evidence shows that stroke patients with atrial fibrillation assigned to apixaban, a novel oral anticoagulant, compared with aspirin, had a substantially lower risk of recurrent stroke or systemic embolism (2.4% vs 9.6% per year, hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 0.60). 1 The safety advantage for novel oral anticoagulants over warfarin may be even larger during the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 pandemic, because it will be challenging for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation who take warfarin to receive regular blood tests to monitor international normalized ratios, and therefore it may be prudent to prescribe novel oral anticoagulants instead of warfarin to stroke patients with atrial fibrillation during this crisis period. On the other hand, a large cohort study showed that discontinuation of aspirin was associated with a 40% increase in the risk of ischemic stroke compared with continuation of therapy in people taking aspirin for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. 2 It would be a disaster if stroke patients cannot continuously take their prescribed antithrombotic agent during this pandemic.",
