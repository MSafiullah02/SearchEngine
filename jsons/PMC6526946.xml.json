            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in preweaned dairy calves (Windeyer et al., 2014; Cramer and Stanton, 2015). Although NCD and BRD may be independent events affecting calves before weaning, the risk of BRD is increased in calves that have had other disease problems such as NCD in the first 2-wk of life (Windeyer et al., 2014). Effective prevention, detection, and treatment are paramount for controlling NCD and, therefore, BRD, but the development of farm protocols is challenging because of the mixed array of causative organisms (viral, bacterial, or parasitic), the prevalence of mixed infections, and the potential role of nutrition. Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Salmonella spp. are important enteropathogens of 5- to 14-d-old calves (McGuirk, 2008). Treatment is challenging because approved antimicrobial drugs have questionable efficacy (Smith, 2015) and antibiotic use may increase emergence of resistant bacteria (Berge et al., 2006). With few effective treatment and prevention options, passive transfer of the maternal antibody remains a mainstay in managing NCD. However, recent studies have provided evidence for the effectiveness of egg yolk\u2013derived antibody protection against diarrhea (Yokoyama et al., 1998; Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Vega et al., 2011; Diraviyam et al., 2014).",

Interleukin-10 knockout mice are more resistant to C. parvum infection (Campbell et al., 2002), suggesting that Il-10 induction may prolong C. parvum infection and slow recovery. Provision of an oral antibody to IL-10 to broiler chickens infected with the coccidian parasite, Eimeria spp., eliminated growth depression (Sand et al., 2016). Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine whether anti-IL-10 egg yolk antibodies fed upon arrival to a calf ranch would lower the fecal shedding of C. parvum in preweaned dairy calves after natural exposure. Our secondary objectives included measuring the effect of anti-IL-10 antibody on calf health, performance, fecal acidity, and shedding of less common diarrheal pathogens.",

On enrollment day, blood was collected into BD Vacutainer tubes without additive (Becton, Dickinson and Company) to measure serum total protein (STP) as a proxy for passive transfer of maternal antibody. Microhematocrit tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) Serum was collected after centrifugation at 11,269 \u00d7 g at 23\u00b0C for 5 min (IEC MB Centrifuge, International Equipment Company, Nashville, TN), and STP was determined using a DD-1 Palm Abbe Digital Hand-Held Refractometer (Misco, Minneapolis, MN). Microhematocrit tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) were used to centrifuge whole blood at 11,269 \u00d7 g at 23\u00b0C for 5 min. The PCV was measured using a microhematocrit reader chart (VIN, Davis, CA), and plasma protein was determined using the DD-1 Palm Abbe Digital Hand-Held Refractometer. Failure of passive transfer was defined as STP <5.5 g/dL. Digital weights (kg; Optima Calf Scale OP 900B, Rancho Cucamonga, CA) were recorded on d 0 and 56 and used to calculate ADG. Hipometer-estimated weights were recorded on d 0, 7, 14, and 56. Hipometer weights were based on the width between the greater trochanters of the left and right femurs as previously described (Dingwell et al., 2006). Antibiotic usage by farm personnel was retrieved from farm computerized records at the end of the trial. Cost per calf was calculated by dividing the total cost of antibiotics used within the group by the total number of calves in each treatment group. Antibiotic costs were based on wholesale prices current during the time of the study.",

Although it is possible that this finding is spurious, others have shown an increased risk of BRD later in the preweaning period in calves that have had earlier disease problems such as NCD in the first 2 wk of life (Windeyer et al., 2014). It is possible that stabilizing fecal pH in very young calves, as demonstrated in the current study, or other unmeasured changes in the gastrointestinal function, had some effect on the development of clinical respiratory disease later in the preweaning period. The mechanism of improved respiratory health seen after improving gastrointestinal health is unknown; however, literature suggests pulmonary\u2013intestinal cross-talk given the similar epithelial surfaces and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (Keely et al., 2012). Similar shared immune components and overlapping pathological changes of inflammation have been noted in human respiratory and intestinal mucosal disease (Keely et al., 2012; McGhee and Fujihashi, 2012). Although antibiotic administration was primarily for treatment of respiratory disease, farm personnel responsible for treatment decisions were blind to treatment group and where not made aware of daily health scores. Therefore, bias at the level of farm personnel should not be driving these observed differences.",
