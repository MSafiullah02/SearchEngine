Due to its high rate of infection, fast transmission, and high mortality, it has seriously threatened people\u2019s physical and mental health (Montemurro, 2020, Tan et al., 2020). Zhang et al. found that the insomnia rate of medical staff in Wuhan was as high as 38.4%, largely consistent with the 34% observed in another research team (Zhang et al., 2020). However, we are not clear about the insomnia symptoms of medical staff supporting Wuhan from different regions. They may also have difference with local medical staff in Wuhan. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and the risk factors of insomnia, so as to provide appropriate management strategies practical, targeted interventions to improve the symptoms of insomnia in medical staff during the epidemic.",

Demographic data were collected using questionnaires, and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) were administered to screen the sleep symptoms (i.e., \u22656 in AIS) and general psychological symptoms (i.e., \u22657 in SRQ-20), respectively.",

Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that among the medical staff in Wuhan, the symptoms of insomnia were related to gender (OR=1.379, P=0.042, 95% CI=0.65\u20132.17), education (OR=1.54, P=0.0076, 95%CI=0.69\u20132.52), and general psychological symptoms (OR=2.124, P<0.01, 95%CI=1.69\u20132.67). Among the medical staff in Ningbo, insomnia was not only related to general psychological symptoms (OR=1.60, P<0.01, 95%CI=1.48\u20131.74) but also related to marital status (OR=0.57, P=0.046, 95%CI=0.33\u20130.99).

Due to the severe condition, such as sensitive to self-health, the spread of the virus, changes in the working environment, and isolation (Chew et al., 2020), the frontline health care workers in Wuhan may create more pressure. We found that gender, education level, depression, anxiety, and other physical symptoms were risk factors for insomnia among medical staff in Wuhan. It is worth noting that in our study, 78.08% of the people who volunteered to support Wuhan were women, especially that 65% are nurses (92% females). Nurses are suffering more stress than doctors, potentially due to longer working hours, higher working load and irregular shifts. On the other hand, during the whole menstrual period, various hormone levels are related to sleep efficiency and sleep quality, women were also more likely to suffer from insomnia, which might explain the high insomnia ratio in volunteer medical staff population (Kang et al., 2020).",

COVID-19 broke out during the Spring Festival in China, forcing parents to return to their hometown with no one to take care of their children, as well as to cancel their holidays in order to join the clinical front line. Thus, worrying about children and parents at home is also more likely to make them more susceptible to stress and prone to insomnia",
