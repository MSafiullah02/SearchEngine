A new coronavirus was identified and named by the World Health Organization first as 2019\u2010nCoV then SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 as the cause of the disease COVID\u201019. While the pathogenesis and aetiology of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is still not completely known, it has been observed that it is genetically similar to SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV1 and that the incubation time is between 1 and 14 days.2 Unlike other human coronaviruses, some patients had low\u2010grade fever or were even asymptomatic yet remained infectious. Recently, snakes have been suggested as the natural reservoirs of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, assuming that the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was the origin of the virus.3\n",

Cases outside of Hubei were first confirmed on 20 January 2020.

Therefore, the log\u2010transformed time from hospital admission to death was regressed in the model. Based on the adjusted R\n2, the time from symptom onset to hospital admission, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities, and age were selected as the independent variables (Table 2). With the exception of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities, all other variables are significant at 5% level. The signs of the coefficients are reasonable as the time from hospitalisation to death was inversely related to age and the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation. The statistical significance of time from symptom onset to hospital suggests the need of timely hospitalisation. In fact, the coefficient of time from symptom onset to hospital admission means that, for any two identical patients who will eventually expire with hospital admission 1 day apart, the expected time from hospital admission to death of the patient with later hospital admission is 8.5% shorter than that of the other patient, all else being equal.",

However, the proportion of deceased patients with fever was lower than the previously reported >90%14 for all infected patients. There is however not sufficient evidence to show that fatality was associated with fever. Although a small proportion (27.3%) of all deceased patients were reported to have dyspnoea, it is possible that the proportion of surviving patients having dyspnoea is even lower. It has recently been suggested that dyspnoea was more commonly observed in patients requiring intensive care (ICU).15\n",

While there is no data available from a control group, a chronic disease prevalence study in the Hubei population may shed light on understanding the relationship between comorbidities and COVID\u201019 mortality. The most recent prevalence study16 in hypertension and diabetes in Hubei province indicated that 30.8% (95% CI 28.2%\u201033.5%) of the population aged 30 or above accounted for hypertension whereas diabetes accounted for 5.6% (95% CI 4.3%\u20107.0%). Therefore, the significant difference in the proportion of diabetes between the deceased patients (26.2%) and Hubei population (5.6%) suggested that diabetes might be associated with mortality.

As of 2 February 2020, 361 deaths have been reported in China, meaning that the fatal cases included in the study accounted for only 13%. As a result, findings of statistical tests and confidence intervals should be interpreted carefully. For instance, pulmonary and cardiovascular comorbidities were likely risk factors for mortality, albeit not statistically significant. Second, a control group should be included for study to verify the mortality risk factors identified in the study. The hospital mortality rate reported in the present study only considered hospitalised cases. It has been reported by the media that some patients were not hospitalised due to the lack of resources. Consequently, the actual case fatality rate might be much higher than the hospital fatality rate. Finally, the data studied were obtained from the official pages of the Chinese health authorities. It is possible that other cases were made public in other ways.",
