Although the psychiatric sequelae of Covid-19 have not been yet systematically studied, it is very likely that a terrified experience of such a drastic viral pandemic, coupled with sense of uncertainty and with the dissemination of lots of misinformation through social media, would take its tremendous toll on mental health of those doomed to be afflicted with illness, household contacts and those witnessed this exceptional moment (Xiang et al., 2020) .",

Experience of quarantine, selfisolation, lockdown, economic crunch and so forth can act as proximal events/allostatic load in genetically predisposed vulnerable population or in mentally ill patients.",

This may take form of panic attacks with dread of losing control or impending doom and getting home-bound, thanatophobia-dread of death, hypochodriasis-morbid preoccupation of getting infected with COVID-19 at first sneeze, flare-up of OCD regarding contamination with ablutomania-compulsive washing or else needlessly compulsive hoarding of groceries, just to name a few. A hysterical contagion (mass hysteria) then sets in. Chronophobia-dread of passing time is a common experience for those in quarantine; a neurotic fear of time typically described in prison neurosis where duration and immensity of time is utterly terrifying to prisoner and passage of time throws him into a panic. At a later stage, people become phlegmatic automatons who live by the 'clock'-wondering when the 14-day isolation is over, when curfew is over, and most importantly when this hardship is over. ICU psychosis and deliria are well-known for those deteriorating cases mandating ventilatory support and monitoring. Some might cope, in maladaptive way, only by resorting to alcohol and substance use. When it is over, those severely traumatized might suffer PTSD with flashbacks and nightmares as if reliving experience at slightest reminder. Enduring personality changes might also ensue.",
