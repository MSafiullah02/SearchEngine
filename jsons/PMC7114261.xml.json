Three inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase have reached the market. Of these, ribavirin (Rebetol\u00ae and Virazole\u00ae) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, which in combination with interferon-alpha is now used for treatment of hepatitis C virus infections (Cinatl et al., 2005). It was thought that ribavirin might be useful for treating coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome infections (SARS) because of its broad-spectrum inhibition of RNA viruses.",

MPA has shown appreciable biological activity, including immunosuppression of inflammation (Vincenti, 2003). Because inflammation is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS (Lee et al., 2004), MPA might be a useful compound in reducing the inflammatory response associated with SARS infections. Another inhibitor, EICAR, is an investigative drug (Shigeta, 2000) (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Of the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors mentioned above, only ribavirin has been extensively evaluated in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) cell culture assays and used for actual treatment of SARS infections. Initial studies by Cinatl et al., 2003a, Cinatl et al., 2003b suggested that ribavirin did not inhibit SARS-CoV replication in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) at therapeutically achievable concentrations. This was subsequently confirmed in several laboratories (Barnard et al., 2004b, Str\u00f6her et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2004, Tan et al., 2004). More than likely ribavirin was not phosphorylated to sufficient levels in Vero cells to achieve an antiviral effect (Cinatl et al., 2005). However, others have found that ribavirin was a potent inhibitor of viral replication in Vero cells (Yamamoto et al., 2004). In addition, ribavirin apparently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in rhesus monkey kidney cells (FRhK-4) at 50 \u03bcg/ml. However, the clinically equivalent concentration of this dose would be above plasma levels achievable in humans (Koren et al., 2003). Morgenstern et al. (2005) have found ribavirin to be efficacious against SARS-CoV in several other cells lines including embryonic African green monkey kidney cells (MA-104), pig kidney cells (PK-15), and human colon carcinoma cell lines (Caco-2 and CL-14).",

In addition, SARS patients in Canada treated with ribavirin still had high copy numbers of SARS-CoV RNA in multiple lobes of the lung at their time of death (Mazzulli et al., 2004). The outcome for patients treated with hydrocortisone and ribavirin was not any better; the plasma levels of SARS-CoV mRNA were increased in the second and third weeks of illness compared to those who received placebo (Lee et al., 2004).

The infection was resolved with the virus totally cleared from the lungs; lung pathology was not detected in this model (Subbarao et al., 2004).",

The results indicated that on day 3, SARS-CoV infection induced significantly higher levels of cytokines (p\n = 0.003) in the lungs in response to virus (group-2) exposure than in uninfected mice (group-1). IL-10, MCP-1 (p\n = 0.05), and MIP-1\u03b1 concentrations were at least three-fold above levels detected in uninfected, untreated mice.

There are no current data demonstrating efficacy in vivo, at least in animals. The in vitro studies described in the current report have demonstrated that ribavirin was inactive in various strains of Vero cells, probably due to lack of phosphorylation to the active triphosphate form (Hong and Cameron, 2004, Morgenstern et al., 2005). In other cell lines such as Caco-2, PK-15, CL-14, HPEK, and MA-104, presumably capable of phosphorylating ribavirin to the triphosphate form, ribavirin was found to be efficacious (IC50 = 2\u201360 \u03bcg/ml) at concentrations that could be achieved clinically (Morgenstern et al., 2005). In the current study, ribavirin evaluated in Vero 76 cells was active at around 270 \u03bcM (IC50 \u223c 660 \u03bcg/ml), but was also toxic (average CC50 = 690 \u03bcM, \u223c1685 \u03bcg/ml). In our studies, ribavirin was also only inhibitory at very high concentrations in MA-104 cells and CaCo-2 cells and not selectively inhibitory in either cell line. In a number of the studies cited above (Tan et al., 2004, Saijo et al., 2005), especially those showing the efficacy of combinational therapy with interferon (Morgenstern et al., 2005), there was a failure to report or to do rigorous (i.e., spectrophotometric analysis) cytotoxicity evaluations. Alternatively, the duration of the assays was so short that toxicity may have been minimized, although in our studies ribavirin was still only inhibitory at very high concentrations. Thus, based on the in vitro data, it has been very difficult to determine if ribavirin is efficacious independent of toxicity and to determine if it should be recommended for treating SARS infections.",

Retrospective analysis of those studies did not demonstrate the efficacy of ribavirin (Mazzulli et al., 2004, Leong et al., 2004), except in one study in which treatment with ribavirin plus steroid was associated with a better outcome than ribavirin treatment alone (Cheng et al., 2004). Most studies did not find any association of ribavirin with reduced viral loads (Mazzulli et al., 2004). In addition, two patients treated with ribavirin early in the infection (days 4 and 6 of illness) seemed to have the highest virus titers in the lungs upon post mortem examination when compared to other patients (Mazzulli et al., 2004), although Wang et al. (2004) reported that ribavirin reduced viral loads in five of eight patients. In addition to the apparent lack of efficacy in most studies, the risk of ribavirin-induced anemia along with hypoxia resulted in increased risk of death in the treated SARS patients (Chiou et al., 2005). Thus, ribavirin may not be useful for treating SARS infections because of its questionable efficacy and because of its known toxicity (reviewed by van Vonderen et al., 2003, Lai, 2005).",

As has been shown by examination of sera from patients with active SARS infections (Mazzulli et al., 2004, Pang et al., 2003), infection of mice with SARS-CoV also triggered a large increase in inflammatory chemokines in C57BL/6 mice (Glass et al., 2004). Large increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the sera of patients recovering from SARS infections (Wang et al., 2005) have also been detected. Likewise, we have shown a large increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of BALB/c mice. Virus lung titers detected in ribavirin-treated mice (group-8) on day 7 apparently corresponded with a concomitant increase in the levels of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and MCP-1) in the lungs of infected, ribavirin-treated animals (group-8) at this time as opposed to the normal levels of cytokines detected in infected control (group-6) animals at day 7. In contrast, levels of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3, in particular, were substantially higher in the virus-infected mice (group-6). However, the virus in the lung was cleared in infected animals not treated with ribavirin virus (group-6), but was present at high levels in the lungs of ribavirin-treated, infected animals (group-8). This observation may reflect the finding in vitro that IFN-\u03b3, along with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2, can reduce virus titers detected in cell culture to below detectable limits (Cinatl et al., 2003a, Cinatl et al., 2003b, Scagnolari et al., 2004) accounting for the lack of detectable virus in the group-6 animals. The lack of interferon in the ribavirin-treated, infected animals may be due to the lack of sufficient IFN-\u03b3 levels to control the virus.",

These cytokine results suggest that ribavirin may have mediated the cytokine inflammatory response at day 3. However, the virus loads in ribavirin-treated infected mice were significantly greater than in the untreated, infected mice and suggest that the return of cytokines to normal levels was not enough to inhibit viral replication.

The possibility also exists that ribavirin might have immunomodulatory properties which adversely affect the clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs, at least in mice. For example, ribavirin can have an indirect immunomodulatory effect, as it has been shown to decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages of mice (Cheng et al., 2004). It also has been shown to suppress IL-10 levels in BALB/c mice (Tam et al., 1999) as it did initially in the current study. Ribavirin has been shown to switch the immune response of mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus, another coronavirus, from a Th-2 to Th-1 response (Ning et al., 1998). In agreement with these findings, ribavirin has been reported to promote T-cell mediated immunity such as the induction of INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 (Tam et al., 2002), none of which were enhanced in the presence of ribavirin in SARS infected mice in our study. Alternatively, one could argue that inbred animals could have some potential genetic defect responsible for enhancement of virus infection in the presence of ribavirin. However, other studies in our laboratory indicate that totally unrelated compounds, such as promazine, also enhance viral infection at certain doses (Barnard et al., 2006). However, it would be interesting to evaluate ribavirin in outbred animals infected with SARS-CoV.",

Thus, ribavirin treatment may have altered the cytokine environment in the lung to allow viral persistence (i.e., polarized to a Th1 response) and to select against the development of responses such as neutralizing antibody that would normally abrogate viral replication (Hong and Cameron, 2004). The cytokines levels in mice at day 7 support this hypothesis, since some Th1-associated cytokines were at abnormally high levels at day 7.",

This could suggest that a certain cell type essential for viral clearance such as type I pneumocytes or alveolar macrophages may have been functionally inhibited or induced to apoptosis, thus leading to the escape of virus from the initially important first line of defense that prevents or limits viral infection. Supporting this hypothesis are the following studies. IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in a number of cell types (Jayaram et al., 2002, Meier et al., 2003, Khanna et al., 2004, Anatol et al., 2005, Ishitsuka et al., 2005). Mycophenolic acid has been shown to suppress production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and LDH in macrophages as well as inhibit the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase in the macrophages (Jonsson and Carlsten, 2002). This suppression of metabolic activities was probably a function of the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitory properties of the mycophenolic acid, since all of the suppressed activities could be reversed with the addition of guanosine. In addition, mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to inhibit differentiation, maturation, and allostimulatory functions of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Colic et al., 2003). Ribavirin has also been shown to inhibit macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th2 cytokines while preserving Th1 cytokine induction (Ning et al., 1998). Thus, under the right conditions IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors may actually promote viral infections by suppressing the function of or inhibiting cell types necessary for normal clearance of virus.",
