It is a highly infective disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV). Then, the disease spread rapidly in the other regions of China and even abroad, and has become global health emergency as declared by the World Health Organization [1]. As of March 17, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the world is close to 200,000. The outbreak of COVID-19 has seriously affected people\u2019s daily life, physical and mental health, and economic activities. At present, researches on COVID-19 suggest that patients of all ages are susceptible to the disease, and individuals with comorbid conditions are more susceptible and tend to have poor outcomes [2].",

A recent report based on 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 indicates that the most common symptom in adult patients is fever (43.8%) on admission, the percentage of which is more higher during hospitalization (88.7%) [7]. The typical CT imaging manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia is multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) with patchy consolidation that tends to develop in the outer zones of the lung and particularly in the subpleural regions [3, 8\u201310]. Due to the immaturity of immune systems in children, more attention should be paid to those subjects in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, limited data are available for children with COVID-19 pneumonia. As a simple and quick imaging tool, CT can accurately detect and assess the lung lesions pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To date, CT findings have been recommended as major evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. In the present study, we aimed to conduct a retrospective study to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children.",

The inclusion criteria were 1) patients aged less than 6 years; 2) patients with complete clinical history information and CT image data; and 3) patients with good chest CT image quality. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th Trial Edition) proposed by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China [11]. All patients were positive for COVID-19 after detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swabs or aspirates via laboratory testing with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The CT images and clinical data of all patients were collected. All patients were administered with anti-viral and supportive treatment, and prevention of complications based on their clinical condition.",

The CT scan was performed by technicians with over 5 years of experience. Comprehensive protective measures for technicians included wearing isolation gowns, caps, masks, protective goggles, gloves, and shoe covers. Scanning rooms were regularly disinfected. Children under the age of 4 years were examined after sedation to reduce artifacts. All patients wore masks for protection.",

Of the eight cases in this study, two subjects had a travel history to Wuhan for surgery; however, these two cases were in Wuhan prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19. Based on the history of exposure, their incubation periods were greater than 14 days. Thus, it is reasonable to think that the COVID-19 already existed in Wuhan before January 2020, or that the two cases were all postoperative cases with low immunity who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 after they returned home. Findings from a recent study also indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infections in children were occurring early in the epidemic [16]. Of the six remaining cases, two mild cases had a history of family members (mothers) infected, and thus were familial outbreaks. In four cases, the parents denied or were uncertain concerning the history of contact with the epidemic area.",

The early-stage imaging features of preschool children are not typical, mainly presenting consolidations, while the most common early-stage CT feature in adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is the GGO distributed along the bronchovascular bundle or the dorsolateral and subpleural part of the lungs [12]. Pulmonary consolidations were smaller in the present cases and showed changes that included small patches or nodules with unclear margins. There were no pure GGO, or \u201ccrazy paving sign\u201d, or other imaging features that are typical findings in adult patients at the early stage [17\u201319]. The chest CT manifestations of the eight cases were mostly mild or moderate, with better outcomes after treatment. The lesions were significantly absorbed in 6\u201312 days. This is different from changes in adult that pulmonary interstitial fibrosis is common after treatment. In our study, there was one critical case who was only 8 months old and had a previous history of surgery and combined with mycoplasma infection, suggesting that infants can also be infected with the SARS-CoV-2, and that a previous surgical history and comorbidity may aggravate the progression of COVID-19. Asthmatic bronchitis- and bronchial pneumonia-like changes are also characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in preschool children, which were found in four cases in our study. In addition, the COVID-19 pneumonia in preschool children can manifest as small airway lesions, with uneven lucency of the regional lung lobe or multiple small cystic lucency shadows in the bilateral lower lungs.",

Common diseases seen in young children in winter are mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A (H1N1) with pneumonia, and adenovirus pneumonia. Therefore, the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia need to be differentiated from those infectious diseases. The most common CT manifestations of mycoplasma pneumonia are bilateral peribronchial perivascular interstitial infiltrations in central and middle lung zones [20]. One case in our study was confirmed to have mycoplasma and SARS-CoV-2 infection at the same time. Adenoviral pneumonia mostly occurs in children, mainly involving the middle and inner zones of bilateral lungs and presenting hilar enlargement, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema, subcutaneous emphysema, while involvement of subpleural areas is rare [21]. The most common imaging features of H1N1 pneumonia are unilateral or bilateral GGO with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation, and the GGO and areas of consolidation had a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution [22, 23], which is difficult to distinguish from CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.",
