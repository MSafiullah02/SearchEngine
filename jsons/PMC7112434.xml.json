In such areas the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with proteinrich oedema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, and cellular debris, a moderate number of alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes (figure 1\n). The cytoplasm of some of these macrophages contained erythrocytes or pools of oedema fluid. There was extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. In areas with more advanced diffuse alveolar damage, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina contained mainly alveolar macrophages (figure 1). Regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles, visible as one irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. In some areas, the alveolar walls were lined by deep eosinophilic hyaline membranes (figure 1). There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) in bronchioles and alveoli, either attached to the wall or free in the lumen (figure 1). These syncytia had up to about 30 peripheral nuclei, abundant hyaline eosinophilic cytoplasm, and, based on positive CD68 staining and negative pan-keratin staining, originated from marcophages. Enlarged type 2 pneumocytes with large vacuolated nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant vesicular cytoplasm were frequently found attached to the alveolar walls (figure 2\n). The epithelial origin of these cells was confirmed by keratin expression (figure 2). By contrast, alveolar macrophages had smaller nuclei, less prominent nucleoli, and were generally loose in the alveolar lumina (figure 2). The identity of these cells as macrophages was confirmed by CD68 staining (figure 2). Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium.",

The SARS patients in cohort 4 co-infected with human metapneumovirus were mostly health-care workers from the same ward and who shared resting areas. The circulation of this infection among them during the SARS outbreak probably explains the frequency of the infection in cohort 4. Similarly, four SARS patients from Canada were infected with SARS-CoV and human metapneumovirus.5 The clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus infection vary from mild upper-respiratory-tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia.24 The possible role of human metapneumovirus infection in exacerbating SARS remains to be assessed.",

The isolation of SARS-CoV from the kidney of one macaque suggests viral replication at that site, but this theory could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.",
