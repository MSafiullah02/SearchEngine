In patients with IHCA, 2D echocardiography has been shown to facilitate the rapid detection or exclusion of various aetiologies during the peri-resuscitative period and to help physicians identify targets for possible correction9. Furthermore, 2D echocardiography is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of post-arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD), a common condition affecting patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after IHCA10\u201312.

Accordingly, 1,887 patients with a first IHCA event were initially screened for study inclusion. Of those, 1,115 achieved ROSC after ICPR. After excluding 42 patients who underwent ICPR in the emergency department and 23 patients whose ICPR information was incomplete or missing, 1,050 patients were stratified according to their 2D echocardiography status. Eligible patients who underwent 2D echocardiography were assigned to the 2D-echo group, and those who did not undergo 2D echocardiography were assigned to the non-2D-echo group. The initial 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups included 145 (13.8%) and 905 patients (86.2%), respectively. After PS matching, 142 and 284 patients remained in the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups, respectively (Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of patients included in the analyses before and after PS matching are shown in Table 1. After PS matching, all covariates were well-balanced between the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups, with an absolute value of the standardised mean difference (ASD) of <0.1. The PS distributions of the two groups were also similar, as demonstrated by a comparison between pre- and post-PS values (Fig. S1).",

In a logistic regression analysis of the PS-matched cohort, the in-hospital survival rate in patients in the 2D-echo group was 2.35-fold higher than that in patients in the non-2D-echo group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55\u20133.57; P < 0.001). A multivariable logistic regression analysis of the entire cohort similarly revealed that the in-hospital survival rate in patients in the 2D-echo group was 2.26-fold higher than that in patients in the non-2D-echo group (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.53\u20133.34; P < 0.001; Fig. 2). Table 3 presents the differences in in-hospital survival between the PS-matched 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups according to the aetiology of IHCA. When the aetiology of IHCA was cardiac arrest of a cardiac cause (n = 336), the in-hospital survival rate in patients in the 2D-echo group was 2.51-fold higher than that in patients in the non-2D echo group (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.56\u20134.04; P < 0.001).

However, a subgroup analysis revealed that this association was only evident if the IHCA had a cardiac aetiology. This finding, which was demonstrated using both PS matching and multivariable-adjusted analyses of the entire cohort, is significant, because it suggests that 2D echocardiography should be performed within 24 hours of ROSC after IHCA to allow physicians to make more appropriate treatment decisions.",

First, and most importantly, PAMD was unlikely to be detected in patients who did not undergo 2D echocardiography within 24 hours after ROSC10\u201312. As rapid 2D echocardiography is required for the diagnosis of possible PAMD during the post-arrest period13, patients in our study who did not undergo 2D echocardiography within 24 hours were less likely to receive appropriate treatment for this condition. Second, 2D echocardiography can facilitate the rapid diagnosis or elimination of reversible causes of IHCA9, such as acute cardiac tamponade14, myocardial infarction15, or pulmonary embolism16. Therefore, such causes may not have been identified in patients who did not undergo 2D echocardiography (i.e., those in the non-2D echo group), whereas patients in the 2D-echo group were more likely to benefit from rapid detection and treatment. Third, 2D echocardiography may have helped to improve the quality of post-arrest care in patients with IHCA due to non-cardiac causes (e.g., sepsis or hypovolemia). Consistent with this possibility, 2D echocardiography has been reported to facilitate the management of septic and hypovolemic shock7,8,17.",

We note that these studies differed decisively with respect to patient selection. Our study included every patient who achieved ROSC after ICPR for IHCA, regardless of their 2D echocardiography status within 24 hours, and differences in survival to discharge were compared between the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups. In contrast, the study by Jentzer and colleagues only included patients who underwent 2D echocardiography and only investigated the associations between echocardiographic findings and survival. Our reinterpretation of their findings suggests that the 55 patients prospectively included in the study by Jentzer et al. were likely to have received reasonable treatment after ROSC in accordance with their 2D echocardiographic findings. Therefore, the general effects of appropriate treatment were unlikely to lead to significant differences in survival rates determined according to 2D echocardiographic findings in the study by Jentzer and colleagues.",

Interestingly, patients with cardiac IHCA of a non-cardiac cause (i.e., respiratory arrest) did not realise survival benefits from 2D echocardiography performed within 24 hours after ROSC. Pulmonary function and ventilator support are the conventional determinants of in-hospital survival in patients with respiratory failure19, and the benefits of 2D echocardiography in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have not been fully established20. In this context, our findings suggest that patients who underwent 2D echocardiography within 24 hours after respiratory arrest either were significantly less likely to change therapy or were more likely to receive a worse prognosis than were patients with cardiac arrest of a cardiac cause. Additional studies are needed to determine whether 2D echocardiography is useful for patients with respiratory arrest, given the associated time and financial costs.",

However, a prospective study by Jentzer et al. evaluated 55 adults undergoing 2D echocardiography within 24 hours after ROSC from ICPR18, which is in line with our study. It is possible that performing 2D echocardiography much less than 24 hours after ROSC from ICPR might result in greater benefits for in-hospital survival than simply performing it sometime within 24 hours.

Third, although many variables were included as confounders in the PS matching and multivariable adjustments, additional unmeasured confounders may have affected outcomes.
