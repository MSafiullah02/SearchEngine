The scale of viral spread worldwide, coupled with the subsequent burden on healthcare systems, makes tackling the virus a monumental task. Governments around the world are employing strategies to minimise loss of life while trying to maintain functioning economies. The changes in healthcare in the United Kingdom, seen over the last few weeks, are unprecedented. Intensive care capacity has been increased exponentially, resources including personal protection equipment (PPE) and ventilators are being manufactured at an impressive rate, and, the workforce is being mobilised or redeployed. It is estimated that 2, 660 doctors are among the 12,000 retired NHS staff returning to clinical practice.1 Medical and nursing students are volunteering their services. Final year medical students will have their graduation date brought forward in order to join the workforce. Since its launch on March 24 2020, 405,000 people applied to be a NHS volunteer responder within the first 24 hours. This number now stands at 700,000.2\n",
