Astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells play an important role in normal functions as well as in immunologic and pathologic processes in the central nervous system (CNS). The interaction between coronaviruses and these cells induces various inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, MHC and NO, which acting in concert are involved in the pathogenesis of demyelination.",

The BBB is an important mechanism for protecting the brain from fluctuations in plasma composition and from circulating agents such as neurotransmitters and xenobiotics capable of disturbing neural function (Abbott and Romero 1996) . The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and coordinated activity of neurons (Abbott 2002) . The brain endothelium has lower levels of endocytosis/transcytosis than peripheral capillaries, but has a number of specific transport and enzyme systems, which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. The brain endothelium also contains specific enzymatic systems such as monoamine oxidase that support the protective and detoxifying roles of the BBB. Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells are also considered as potential APCs because of their large cumulative surface and their unique anatomical location between circulating T cells and the extra-vascular sites of antigen exposure. Thus BBB covers a number of static and dynamic properties that enable the endothelium to protect and regulate the brain microenvironment (Abbott and Romero 1996) .",

In vitro cell culture models have provided a great deal of information about the key role of astrocytes in the induction of the BBB phenotype in brain endothelium (Bauer and Bauer 2000) . The chemical nature of the glial-produced inductive signal(s) is currently unclear. TGF-13 (Tran et al. 1999) , GDNF (Utsumi et al. 2000) , bFGF (Sobue et al. 1999 ), IL-6 and hydrocortisone (Hoheisel et al. 1998 ) have been shown to modulate endothelial differentiation and induction. In addition to a role in barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes may play active roles in modulating BBB permeability by the release of several humoral agents including glutamate, aspartate, taurine, ATP, ET-1, NO, TNF~, MIP2 and IL-1 ~, although the regulation of this release is not well understood (Abbott 2002) . Interestingly, it has recently been shown that endothelial cells induce the differentiation of astrocyte precursor cells into astrocytes in vitro, which is mediated by endothelial cell production of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Mi et al. 2001) . Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction.

Although class II MHC molecules are essential for lymphocyte development, antigen presentation, and T-cell activation, inappropriate class II expression has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and MS (Grusby and Glimcher 1995) . Class II MHC molecules are normally expressed on professional APCs, such as B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and thymic epithelium, expression on other cell types, including astrocytes, can be induced and/or regulated by cytokines, neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides. Astrocytes were the first CNS cell type shown to express class II MHC molecules upon IFN-7 stimulation in vitro (Wong et al. 1984) . The cytokine TNF-a, while having no influence alone on class II MHC expression, enhances IFN-7-induced class 11 MHC expression on astrocytes (Panek et al. 1994) . Infection of astrocyte cultures derived from MHV-susceptible Lewis rats with MHV-JHM resulted in induction of MHC class II, whereas no such induction was observed in astrocytes from disease-resistant Brown Norway rats . A number of soluble mediators have been shown to inhibit class 11 MHC expression in astrocytes, which include TGF-13, IL-113, IFN-13, IL-4, glutamate, vasoactive intestinal peptide, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide (Rohn et al. 1996) . The expression of MHC II on phagocytic microglia implies the capacity of microglia as APCs. Phagocytic microglia is often regarded as potentially cytotoxic in both acute and chronic CNS disorders. MHC class 11 expression by phagocytic microglia also corresponds to the elevated expression of potentially cytotoxic substances in the CNS, among which nitric oxide and TNF-~ are notably involved in the death of oligodendrocytes and demyelination (Benveniste 1997; Eugster et al. 1999) . A study on the demyelinating twitcher mouse has shown that the number of reactive microglia and the concomitant demyelination is significantly reduced when the twitcher mouse carries an MHC 11 null background (Matsushima et al. 1994 ). Therefore, MHC 11 expression by activated microglia in chronic neurodegenerative disorders may indicate that the activated microglia become cytotoxic (Zhang et al. 2001 ).",

In many of these diseases, astrocytes and microglia are responsible for some of the production of cytokines and chemokines, whereas blood-borne inflammatory cells are responsible for the rest. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have documented the ability of astrocytes to produce interleukin-1, -6, and -10 (IL-1, -6, and -10); interferon (IFN)-a, and -[3; colony-stimulating factors GM-CSF, M-CSF, and G-CSF; TNF-a; TGF-[3; and chemokines including RANTES, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IFN-7-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) (Dong and Benveniste 2001) .

In most acute encephalitis cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6 and IFN-y are detected in the CNS of infected mice. Depletion of IFN-y leads to decreased virus clearance and greater mortality. However, neutralization of TNF-ct did not appear to affect either T cell recruitment or virus clearance.

The results show that infections of cultures with neurotropic viruses MHV-A59 and JHM up-regulate IL-113, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-15 and TNF-~ mRNA in both astrocytes and microglia, significantly more than infection with the nonneurotropic virus MHV-2. Similar up-regulation was observed in mouse brains during acute encephalitis and in mouse spinal cords during the chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease but a different profile was seen in the liver during acute hepatitis. There are close interactions between the five upregulated cytokines. Studies of MHV-A59 infections in cultures derived from cytokine knockout mice indicate that IL-12 and TNF-~ are the upstream molecules that cause the subsequent up-regulation of the other three cytokines. Furthermore we found that infection with neurotropic MHVs induce up-regulation of a set of chemokines in astrocytes and microglia, including MIP-1, MIP-3, MCP-2, MCP-5, MIG. This pattern of cytokine/chemokine response in astrocytes and microglia is similar to the Thl response of lymphocytes and appears to be associated with the neurotropic properties of the virus strain. These studies allow us to study the unique contribution of CNS local immune cells to the process of MHV disease and thus provide new insights into the pathogenesis of MHVinduced neurological diseases as well as the general role of brain immune cells and cytokines in the process of immune-mediated diseases of the CNS (Li et al. 2004) .",

The cytokines IL-113, TNF-m IL-6 are expressed by astrocytes which are located near the sites of demyelination in chronically infected spinal cords (Perlman 1998) . A wide range of cytokines have been detected in MS lesions, and IL-la and 13, IL-6, TNF-ct, and IFN-y may participate in the CNS demyelination process (Benveniste 1998) . Cytokines such as IFN-7, TGF-13, IL-1, IL-4, and IL-10 may regulate class II MHC expression (Han et al. 1999; O'Keefe et al. 1999) . Cytokines induce increased expression of chemokines, stimulate adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, and allow leukocyte entry into the CNS. Thus cytokines are involved in the initial phase as well as the development stages of demyelination. Studies using knockout mice have shown that neither perforin, Fas-FasL, TNF-c~, IL-10 or IFN-y are required for demyelination (Haring and Perlman 2001) . Our own studies in knockout mice indicate that deficiency of IL-6 and IL-12p40 does not decrease the level of demyelination induced by MHV-A59 infection compared to wide type C57BL/6 mice. Thus, none of the single cytokines plays a crucial role in demyelination, however, we still did not rule out that a combination of cytokines may be required for demyelination. Chemokines may play a role in demyelination. RANTES is a proinflammatory chemokine that act as a chemoattractant for a variety of lymphocytic and myeloid cell types including monocytes and granulocytes (Lane et al. 2000) . Inhibition of RANTES has been shown to reduce MHV induced demyelination (Lane et al. 1999 ). An alternative hypothesis is that MHV could potentially damage oligodendrocytes by disrupting the function of astrocytes, which in turn affect oligodendrocytes (Sun and Perlman 1995) .",

More recent studies show that NOS2 function is not required for demyelination in mice infected with MHV-JHM (Wu et al. 2000) . Although NO may have a transient role in the early steps of demyelination, it is not necessary for disease to develop. Infection of NOS2 knockout (-/-) and NOS2(+/+) mice with MHV resulted in similar kinetics of viral clearance from the brain and comparable levels of demyelination. MHV-infected NOS2(-/-) mice displayed a marked decrease in mortality as compared to infected NOS2(+/+) mice, which correlated with a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells present in the brain. These studies indicate that NOS2-generated NO contributes to apoptosis of neurons but not demyelination following MHV infection (Chen and Lane 2002) .",

            "text": "The BBB has been assumed to be an effective barrier for blood cells. However, during viral infections or autoimmune diseases of the CNS, T lymphocytes are activated and migrate into the CNS and initiate the cellular events leading to inflammation and demyelination within the CNS white matter. The endothelial BBB has been considered the obvious place of entry of circulating lymphocytes into the CNS. The vascular endothelium is the first element that leukocytes encounter. Immune-specific interactions between lymphocytes and cerebral endothelium have been excluded as an initial mechanism. Adhesion interaction between T cells and endothelia must precede transmigration (Hart and Fabry 1995) . Certain adhesion molecules seem to be critically involved in this process for example intercellular adhesion molecule I(ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule I(VCAM-1) are up-regulated on the endothelial cells. Dissociated cultures of cerebral endothelial cells prepared from surgical resections of adult CNS tissue express an array of adhesion molecules whose expression is modulated by encounter with T cells or the cytokines they produce (Calabresi et al. 1997) . Chemical mediators, particularly chemokines, regulate the synthesis, surface expression, and avidity of adhesion molecules. The most important adhesion molecule pairs are the selectins (E, L and P), the immunoglobulins ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and the beta 2 and beta 1 integrins (e.g., LFA-1 and VLA-4), which play a role in a number of pathological processes (Cotran and Mayadas-Norton 1998) .",

The brain resident cells respond to infection by coronavirus by producing various inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, MHC and NO, which could act in concert to orchestrate an inflammatory pathology in the CNS. This argues for an indirect immunologic mechanism by which coronavirus infection could be implicated in a pathogenesis of the CNS diseases. However, one can conclude from all these data that no single molecule is absolutely required for coronavirus-induced demyelination, neither cytokines, MHC class I or II, nor NOS2. Furthermore, no specific immune cell population is essential for coronavirus-induced demyelination, neither CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, nor hematogenous macrophages (Gombold et al. 1995; Sutherland et al. 1997) . Therefore, coronavirus-induced demyelination may be a result of multiple mechanisms, which still need further investigation.",
