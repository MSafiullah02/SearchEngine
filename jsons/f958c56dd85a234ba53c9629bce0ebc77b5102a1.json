Many individuals are also experiencing a loss of physical/mental health and general safety and autonomy.

For many hospitalized patients, visitors are limited or prohibited, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis. For bereaved individuals, funerals and burials are postponed or held remotely, often without presence of family or the possibility of the warm embrace from loved ones. Social media feeds are full of devastating stories-families denied opportunities to say goodbye before a death, or loved ones saying goodbye over phone/video, uncertain whether each communication is the last. Clinicians are isolating themselves from their own families indefinitely due to worry about potentially spreading infection. Individuals are urgently updating advance directives and wills, making complex decisions on ventilation and resuscitation, and considering who will care for their children if they die. Grief is inherently a normal part of this myriad of COVID-19 experiences.

With the number of COVID-19 deaths currently doubling within days(3), medical personnel are expecting to experience death at unprecedented rates. Viewing maps of global spread, individuals can anticipate the virus coming closer, increasing distress. Experiences of death become more personal as COVID-19 affects communities broadly. Anticipatory grief results from uncertainty as well as trying to make sense of what is coming. In response to these projected numbers, hospitals are preparing and planning for a surge of patients with potential limitations in necessary equipment, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. For patients and families, there can be unsettled feelings of not knowing how disease will progress or how they will be impacted by changing hospital and facility policies.

While clinicians should not assume that all patients or family members are experiencing CG now during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand how current circumstances may set the stage for CG to occur following death. CG can present symptoms such as recurrent intrusive thoughts of the person who died, preoccupation with sorrow including ruminative thoughts, excessive bitterness, alienation from previous social relationships, difficulty accepting the death, and GRIEF DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 5 perceived purposelessness of life (7) . Under usual/pre-COVID-19 circumstances, family members of patients who died in the hospital or intensive care unit were at a higher risk for prolonged grief (8) . In one national survey, the dying patient's inability to say 'goodbye' to family before death was significantly associated with CG (4) . Other studies show that severe preloss grief symptoms (5) , lower levels of social support(5), lack of preparation for the death(6), and guilt(9) predicted CG and post-loss depression-all relevant factors in facing death in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Due to COVID-19, it is not uncommon for families and communities to experience multiple losses given the methods by which the disease spreads. In one study among home hospice patients, nearly half experienced high anxiety and/or depression during the last week of life (11) . However, symptom management and quality of care at end of life is generally better in hospice compared to hospital deaths (8) , suggesting that anxiety and depression may be even higher at the end of life in hospitals. This seems particularly likely with additional context that deaths during this time may be complicated by ethical decisions in triaging resources (12) , quick transitions between 'ill' and 'dying' in previously healthy patients, and limitations in visitors who can be physically present at the bedside. While research cannot yet report on psychologic processing at end of life during social isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, one can reasonably extrapolate that many are dealing with higher levels of anxiety/depression during this uncertain time. These likely contribute negatively to the quality of the dying experience, which predicts experiences of CG (6) .",

During a time of a crisis this focus can be amplified, and the concept of self-care may feel counterintuitive. However, dealing with the personal thoughts and emotions that arise during care is pertinent to providing ongoing ethical care for patients and families (27) . This self-awareness, or the ability to attend to the needs of the patient, the overall GRIEF DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 9 work environment, and ones own subjective experience, can enhance the role of self-care in overcoming accumulated stress and grief in providers (28) . In fact, personal awareness, along with inner and social self-care, is positively associated with a health care professional's ability to cope with death in their professional setting (29) . Self-care is of utmost importance to minimize potential for long-term outcome effects so that providers are able to continue caring for patients during this unprecedented strain on the health care system (30) . Some self-care strategies to help individuals cope with stress during an event include: being able to take breaks and disconnect from the disaster event, feeling prepared and informed in facilitating their response role, being aware of local resources and services to refer patients to for additional recovery assistance, and having adequate supervision and peer support while facilitating response(31) (see Table 2 ).",
