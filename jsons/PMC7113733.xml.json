(Belouzard et al., 2012). The virus invades porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (Kim and Lee, 2013) causing diarrhea and dehydration in pigs. Upon PEDV infection, the mortality of piglets may reach 100% (Alvarez et al., 2015), which can cause huge economic losses in the swine industry. Because of the genetic variation particularly in the S gene (Jung and Saif, 2015, Lee, 2015), the available PEDV vaccines cannot prevent all PEDV infections. Because of this, further development of prophylactic and treatment strategies is necessary to restrict PEDV infection.",

These components, such as UNC-51-like kinase (ULK), class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex and autophagy-related genes (ATG), are assembled into isolated membrane bound compartments from the plasma membrane that is isolation and nucleation (Deretic et al., 2013, Dunn, 1994). The isolated membrane bound compartments mature to complete vesicles known as autophagosomes containing ATG and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II, which is produced as a result of LC3-I lipidation by phosphatidylethanolamine. The autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes containing lysosomal enzymes in a low pH environment (Dunn, 1994). The fused vesicle, called an autophagolysosome, undergoes degradation along with its components. This autophagic pathway is critical to maintain cellular homeostasis during stressful conditions such as cellular starvation, infection, or organelle damage (Levine et al., 2011, Mizushima et al., 2010).",

MHV uses autophagy to enhance its replication in embryonic stem cells (Prentice et al., 2004), whereas the replication of MHV is not related with autophagy in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow derived macrophages (Zhao et al., 2007), which suggests that some viruses have different autophagy responses in different cell types. Therefore, a non-transformed porcine jejunum intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) that closely resembles the target cells of PEDV should better be used in order to define the relationship between PEDV infection and autophagy at the cellular and molecular level.",

In order to examine whether rapamycin induces autophagy in porcine IECs, LC3 conversion of IPEC-J2 was examined by immunoblot after 100 nM rapamycin treatment for 12 or 24 h. Rapamycin-treatment for 12 h was not sufficient for the activation of autophagy while LC3-I was reduced and, at the same time, LC3-II was increased at 24 h after the treatment compared with control (Fig. 1\nA and B). The number of LC3 puncta, indicating autophagosomes, was higher in cells treated with rapamycin for 24 h than untreated cells (Fig. 1C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that 100 nM rapamycin activated autophagy without biological damage to the cell (Fig. S1).",

However, until now, the formation of autophagolysosomes indicating autophagic-flux in porcine IEC has not been examined. To investigate if rapamycin can induce autophagolysosome formation in porcine IECs, we used transiently transfected IPEC-J2 cells with ptfLC3 plasmids, in which LC3 proteins are conjugated with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Kimura et al., 2007). GFP is unstable and degraded at low pH whereas RFP is relatively stable in an acidic environment. Therefore, GFP disappears while RFP remains alone in acidic conditions of autophagolysosomes after fusion with lysosomes (Kimura et al., 2007). The formation of autophagolysosomes, which appeared as red spots, was observed in the rapamycin-treated group (Fig. 2\n) suggesting that rapamycin treatment induced autophagic-flux in porcine IECs.",

Moreover, rapamycin treatment induced increase of the formation of double membrane vesicles (Fig. 5B). After PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells, viral particles assumed to be PEDV due to their mostly round shape (Lavazza et al., 2015) and diameter ranging from 95 to 190 nm (Lee, 2015) were found in the cytosol of the cells (Fig. 5B). In particular, cells pretreated with rapamycin had viral particles within vesicles after PEDV infection (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these results showed that PEDV could be positioned within autophagosomes induced by rapamycin, and PEDV might be suppressed by rapamycin-induced autophagy soon after infection.",

The results showed a down regulation in the number of plaque forming units (PFU) in the rapamycin pretreated group (Fig. 6C and D). We also confirmed a lower PEDV infection level in the rapamycin-treated group compared to controls as measured by PEDV mRNA level (Fig. 6E) as well as confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6F). Moreover, to examine whether the restriction of longer PEDV infection is due to rapamycin-induced autophagy, we used wortmannin to block autophagy and confirmed a high PEDV titer compared to rapamycin-treated cells without autophagy inhibition (Fig. 6G). These results demonstrated that rapamycin-induced autophagy can restrict a longer PEDV infection for 24 h.

It has been reported that the virus infected epithelium results in barrier dysfunction by downregulation of tight junction proteins (Zhao et al., 2014) and an increase in interleukin (IL)-8 (Xu et al., 2013) and necrotic cell death (Jung and Saif, 2015). However, the mechanism that defends against PEDV infection in porcine IECs is unknown. Since viral translation for replication occurs in the cytoplasm of target cells (Lee, 2015), we postulated that autophagy which removes unnecessary cytoplasmic components (Levine et al., 2011, Reggiori and Klionsky, 2002) might be a potential effective defense mechanism against PEDV. With reference to existing results showing that autophagy can restrict invasion of other viruses including Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Guo et al., 2016), HSV-1 (Yakoub and Shukla, 2015), and Rift Valley fever virus (Moy et al., 2014), we demonstrated that rapamycin treatment in porcine IECs has a protective function against PEDV through the uptake of the virus into autophagosomes at an early stage of infection. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the defensive mechanism of autophagy against PEDV infection in porcine IECs.",

Especially, the final step of autophagy pathway is to degrade autophagic cargo in autophagosome after the fusion with lysosome. It has been suggested that Beclin 1 is importantly related with progression of the final step (Glick et al., 2010). Coronavirus has the viral papain-like protease (PLP) 2, which could interrupt the autophagic process. The membrane-associated PLP2 of PEDV, a viral protein encoded by coronaviruses, induced an incomplete autophagy, demonstrated by showing the accumulation of autophagosomes and inhibiting formation of autophagolysosome when Beclin1 was removed (Chen et al., 2014b). On the other hand, rapamycin could up-regulate the expression of beclin1 (Xie et al., 2013). Upregulation of beclin1 expression in cells treated with rapamycin might help formation of autophagolysosome, even if PEDV infects and makes PLP2. Although the antiviral mechanism of rapamycin has not been fully elucidated, we postulated that the rapamycin likely has an antiviral effect in porcine epithelial cells infected with PEDV via increasing beclin1 and/or inducing the formation of autophagolysosome.",

Since IECs are in close contact with laminar propria cells, an injured epithelium could lead to the excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines and trigger diarrhea by inducing gut inflammation (Neurath, 2014). Thus, prevention of PEDV infection in porcine IEC before the induction of high levels of inflammation is crucial to reduce diarrhea provoked by PEDV.",

However, it is important to mention that viral infection for 1 h, most often used in various PEDV studies, could not generate cell death in vitro and may not accurately depict an actual PEDV infection. To mimic the repeated infection, IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV for 24 h in the present study that resulted in a cell death. Interestingly, PEDV-induced cell death was alleviated by rapamycin pre-treatment. These results highlighted that autophagy induced by pre-treatment of rapamycin was enough to prevent necrosis induced by the longer infection with PEDV.",
