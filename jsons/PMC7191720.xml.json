Overdose usage of glucocorticoids is a proven cause of ONFH [6]. The ONFH is a disabling condition and often occurs in individuals between 20 and 50 years old [7]. Approximately 65% of ONFH patients eventually require total hip replacements, resulting in a substantial economic and medical burden to the patient and society [8]. Although the relationship between glucocorticoid administration and the development of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH is a well-known phenomenon, the mechanism of its pathogenesis remains obscure [9].",

Also, the regulation of apoptosis during angiogenesis occurs in the BMECs [13]. It has been reported that the functioning of angiogenesis and blood vessel integrity is negatively related to the level of apoptosis [14]. Besides, several studies have reported that the dysfunction of regional endothelial cells due to continuous exposure to glucocorticoids can induce cell apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis [15]. However, there are currently no reports on whether the angiogenic and apoptotic activity of BMECs is affected in glucocorticoid-induced ONFH patients.",

The dysfunction of BMECs has been reported to cause femoral head microcirculation obstacle, which is key to the development of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH [10]. Yu et al. [19] reported that glucocorticoids profoundly affect the transcriptome of BMECs during the early stages of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. According to Yue et al. [18], glucocorticoids can induce BMECs to express various cytokines, which contributes to the development of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. In the present investigation, we isolated BMECs from the subchondral region of the femoral head in the two groups. Cells in the two groups both formed the typical cobblestone morphology of endothelial cells and showed a high expression of CD 31 [20] and vWF [21], the standard markers of endothelial cells. These results indicated that these cells in the two groups were BMECs. Then, we used tube formation and migration assays to examine angiogenesis. The findings of this study indicate that the angiogenic activity of BMECs was profoundly impaired in the ONFH group in comparison with the control group. The reduced angiogenic activity of BMECs in ONFH patients may reflect the dysfunction of BMECs. It has proved that the dysfuntion of BMECs can impair vascular repair, blood vessel growth and finally decrease the local blood flow of the femoral head, which has been considered to be the cause of the glucocorticoid-induced ONFH [11]. Therefore, the reduced angiogenic activity of BMECs is thus a potential mechanism for glucocorticoid-induced ONFH.",

For instance, the study by Yavuz et al. [23] reported that endothelial function declines with an increase in the age of healthy human subjects. In our study, the angiogenesis of BMECs in the ONFH group was remarkably decreased as relative to the control group, even though the ONFH patients were much younger.

Not only osteoblasts but also BMECs participate in the apoptosis process during the progression of ONFH. Kerachian et al. [25] pointed out that apoptosis of BMECs could activate the thrombosis cascade, followed by ischemia and infarction during the development of the glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. Also, Vogt et al. [26] showed that glucocorticoids could reduce angiogenesis by inducing the apoptosis of endothelial cells, and therefore injuring BMECs. Consistent with these studies, the TUNEL-positive cells in our study were only recorded in the ONFH group, suggesting that glucocorticoids induced apoptosis of BMECs in ONFH patients. It is known that caspase cascade plays an essential role in apoptosis and caspase-3 is activated during apoptosis [27]. Overexpression of caspase-3 has previously reported in ONFH patients [28]. Disruption of mitochondrial functions due to oxidative stress factors stimulates the caspase pathway, triggering apoptosis [29]. Also, the stimulation of cells by apoptotic factors facilitates dissociation of the original Bax and Bcl-2, causing an increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 [30]. In this study, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 was markedly suppressed, while Bax and cleaved caspase 3 were increased in the ONFH group. These changes in expression levels suggest that the mitochondria participate in the apoptosis of BMECs in ONFH patients.",
