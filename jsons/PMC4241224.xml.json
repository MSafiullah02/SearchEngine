Untreated TB or TB treated late may lead to severe consequences affecting both mother and child [4],[5]. Pregnant women with pulmonary TB who are treated appropriately do not have increased rates of maternal or neonatal complications, while without treatment, TB can lead to increased neonatal morbidity, low birth weight, prematurity, and increased pregnancy complications, including four-fold increases in maternal morbidity due to higher rates of abortion, post partum haemorrhage, labour difficulties, and pre-eclampsia [5]. Prenatal care could be a very good opportunity for TB screening and diagnosis and for following up TB care, especially for women who have limited access to health services, such as migrants or women of limited social/economic status, who only approach medical services when pregnant [4],[5].",

The AFB smear test appears to have low sensitivity in pregnant women [18],[19],[30], but is still used in low resource settings as part of the procedure for diagnosing active TB due to its low cost and simple technique [13],[30]. AFB culture was used as a confirmation of diagnosis, but is time consuming and not available in low resource settings [13],[23]. Another technique, fluorescence microscopy, was recommended as a substitute for AFB culture because it is cheaper [13]. This procedure is for pulmonary TB cases and cannot identify extra pulmonary TB without additional tests and presence of physical TB symptoms. A clinical examination comprising a questionnaire tracking TB history and detecting TB clinical symptoms was also used and was proven to increase reliability of TB screening and diagnosis when combined with paraclinical tests [13],[23],[27],[30],[41]. Some authors recommended not using chest X-ray for pregnant women if there were no clinical symptoms of TB [30].",

Studies showed that pregnancy does not affect the sensitivity of this test [20], but its result can be affected by HIV infection or any situation that severely weakens the immune system (such as disseminated TB), as these could lead to false negative results [21],[30],[45]. BCG vaccination can also lead to TST positive results in healthy women [11],[28]. In a high HIV prevalence setting, other tests and clinical symptoms should therefore be taken into account in diagnosing TB [41] and the TST and anergy skin tests (the latter is used to evaluate whether the immune system is functioning properly or not and can indicate whether the results of the other skin test are reliable) are recommended as a TB screening method in the prenatal care procedures [31]. In populations in which the majority of people are BCG vaccinated or their vaccination status is uncertain, TST is discouraged and IGRA is recommended for TB screening and diagnosis [11],[28].",

Other significant adverse effects were recorded in a very small number of pregnant women (2 cases of drug induced hepatitis, 2 of PZA allergy, 2 of sensorineural deafness, and 1 of severe nausea and jaundice) and led to termination of therapy without mortality [24],[44]. Streptomycin (SM) was not used in any studies because of its potential risk of deafness in babies. However, a retrospective study was conducted, checking the hearing capacity of 30 children whose mothers received SM injection during pregnancy, and found no significant effect, with only one case of deafness possibly linked to the mother\u2019s use of SM. Authors of this study recommend only using SM after the 2nd trimester if really necessary [35].",

After being counselled by clinicians, only 6/55 women chose abortion, while the rest decided to continue the pregnancy and undergo MDR therapy [37],[44]. Eleven women died (8 died during treatment and 3 died after completing treatment for unknown reasons). There was one stillbirth and one child died prematurely due to pneumonia. One woman and her child were lost to follow up. One woman had to terminate treatment due to hepatitis. Other cases were treated successfully. The results of the studies showed that, with an attentive follow-up and appropriate therapy, MDR-TB pregnant women can be cured and have a positive maternal outcome, and should therefore be given the option to continue with a pregnancy [36],[37],[44]. The results also showed that a delay in, or default, MDR treatment were the main causes of mortality and morbidity for mothers and babies [36],[43],[44].",

Compared to the general population, pregnant women were less likely to initiate the INH prophylaxis \u2013 52.1% vs 14.7% [25]. In all 3 studies, the completion rate among pregnant women was very low (14.7%, 9.3%, and 21.2%) [25],[26],[40].

The main reasons for this delay are that women seek health services and prenatal care at a late stage of their pregnancy and that TB during pregnancy is asymptomatic or has nonspecific symptoms, especially in cases of extra pulmonary TB [18],[23],[38],[45]. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were more likely to be diagnosed with TB via routine screening (as part of prenatal care) [30]. In HIV infected people, the difficulty in diagnosis is even greater since the weak immune reaction may cause false negative TST and make early TB symptoms unclear [21],[32]. Thus, all studies recommended the integration of TB screening in prenatal care procedures for high risk groups.",

Early treatment of TB (1st and 2nd trimester) led to a maternal outcome comparable to that of non-TB infected pregnant women, and to a much better outcome than that of women who received late treatment [17]. Authors also recommended making TB culture mandatory since it is the most reliable standard for confirming TB infection and treatment effectiveness, and for revising the therapy in case of lack of success [15],[33]. Treatment of extra PTB had a less positive prognosis than PTB due to greater difficulty in diagnosis and treatment [16],[38]. If women are diagnosed and treated with anti-TB early, however, the maternal outcome can be positive [16],[24],[33],[45].",

However, the review has some limitations. The studies reviewed were of limited quality and covered multiple aspects of TB care, no intensive analysis for each aspect could therefore be performed. There was a limited number of population-based studies, since most were conducted in a single clinic. Results are therefore not solid enough to be applicable to a larger population. Another limitation was that few studies had control groups; some used comparison groups that were not fully comparable with the study group [16]-[18],[20],[25],[28],[31],[39]. Furthermore, the study designs were weak, since no randomised controlled trials were present. Only one qualitative study was found, and with a disease related to socio-economic status and poverty as is TB, additional qualitative studies would have been useful in identifying attitudes, behaviours, challenges, and opportunities for shaping effective interventions/policies for better care for TB patients. A more general limitation is that the differing resources available between different countries make it difficult to generalise the conclusions.",
