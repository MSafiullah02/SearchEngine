He followed that by conducting several meta-analyses demonstrating a decrease in the incidence and in the number of days of illness following the use of vitamin C. Since then, controversy has arisen with several trials reporting a benefit (mainly in populations who had low vitamin C intake or < physical stress) and others reporting no benefit. Initial reviews indicated that despite the heterogeneity of the studies, supplementation with vitamin C at doses of 1 g/d or more consistently decreased the duration or alleviated the symptoms of the common cold.11, 12 In 2007, a meta-analysis by the Cochrane review group13 attempted to answer the question: does vitamin C in doses of 0.2 g daily or more, reduce the incidence, duration, or severity of the common cold when used either as continuous prophylaxis or at the onset of cold symptoms.",

These seem to activate the alternate complement pathway components, and increased levels of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.14 In addition, Echinacea extracts increase the macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis, as well as secretion of interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 (in vitro and in vivo).15, 16, 17 A Cochrane Review identified 9 trials (N = 1126) with a total of 10 Echinacea groups diagnosed with common cold symptoms, randomized and treated with Echinacea.18 Pressed juices (stabilized with alcohol), alcohol tinctures, or tablets made from dried extracts were the forms of Echinacea used. Outcome measurements were heterogeneous. Treatment groups often used different instruments, timing of measurements, type of analysis, and descriptive statistics.

Three systematic reviews of herbal therapies for asthma were conducted in the last decade, and although they used slightly different methodologies, they all came to similar conclusions. In the most recent and most comprehensive review,65 the investigators found 27 studies assessing 21 herbal preparations involving 1925 participants that met the entry criteria of the review. Small sample sizes, disparate outcome measurements, and relatively short-term follow-up prevented any overall clear conclusion as to efficacy and long-term safety of herbal therapy for asthma. Mean duration of therapy was only 8 weeks. There were large variations in the types of pulmonary function measurements, symptom scores, and types of subjective assessments, greatly limiting the ability of the review to perform combined outcome data assessments or subgroup analysis. With these limitations in mind, the results of a few herbs merit comment.",

Epidemiology studies have shown that populations (such as Eskimo communities) with diets high in fish have low rates of asthma, and as diets in other communities have become higher in saturated fats, asthma incidence has increased.81 Two very small double-blind RCTs of only 10 and 16 patients with exercise-induced asthma using fish oil capsules containing 3.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.0 g of docohexaenoic acid daily for 3 weeks demonstrated clinical improvement in pulmonary function response to exercise, decreased bronchodilator use, and decreased sputum inflammatory mediators.82, 83 However, a Cochrane Systematic Review in 200281 failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit of the use of n-3 marine fatty acids supplementation for asthma. In the comprehensive review, the investigators identified 9 studies that met study inclusion criteria, and found no convincing evidence that supplementation of diet with marine n-3 fatty acids leads to an improvement in asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, bronchial hyper-reactivity or FEV1, nor was there evidence of risk or adverse effects identified. They concluded with 2 interesting caveats: first, that the studies concentrated mainly on supplementation of marine n-3 fatty acids rather than eating more fish per se, and that perhaps there are other elements in the original food source that could have beneficial effects for asthma; second, that much of the interest in n-3 fatty acid supplementation for asthma began in the era when the neutrophil was considered to possibly have an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma, because the most profound antiinflammatory effects of n-3 fatty acids are on neutrophil function and mediator generation. However, eosinophils and mast cells are now believed to be more important effector cells in asthma, and therefore this may explain their relative lack of efficacy, given that n-3 fatty acids lack significant antiinflammatory effect on eosinophils and mast cells in vitro.",

The points are derived from TCM theory and relate to the meridians, a system that purportedly allows the flow of Qi through the body, blockages of which are believed to cause health problems.87 Three comprehensive systematic reviews in 2002, 2003, and 2006 evaluated the effect of acupuncture in asthma, each approaching the literature with slightly different criteria and review techniques. Martin and colleagues88 searched for all RCTs since 1970 that compared acupuncture at real and placebo points and used at least 1 objective measurement of pulmonary function. They took estimates from the 11 trials that met inclusion criteria, and combined estimated standardized mean differences between acupuncture and placebo to estimate the overall effect. The Cochrane Systematic Review87 was only able to pool data for 2 outcomes (PEFR and global assessment of well-being) in the 12 RCTs involving 350 patients that met their criteria. The systematic review by Passalacqua and colleagues64 looked at a variety of CAM modalities in asthma, including acupuncture, without doing meta-analysis.",

(2) As with herbal medications, study quality, sample size, missing information, and heterogeneity in measurements limited data pooling and the ability to draw useful, statistically significant conclusions. (3) Reviewers commented in particular about the challenge unique to acupuncture research in choosing appropriate placebo acupuncture points, noting that studies varied in choosing nonmeridian points versus nonindicated but legitimate acupuncture points for placebo control. The points used in the sham arm of some studies were used for the treatment of asthma in others (according to TCM). Further heterogeneity occurs with needle depth, duration of insertion, choice of laser versus needle, and the choice of either standardized points versus allowing treating providers to individualize and customize points depending on diagnoses made using a TCM nosology quite foreign to western physicians and research methods. They concluded with clear recommendations for larger studies with particular attention to the nature of sham/control points and including a no-treatment control arm in addition to sham groups, as well as the need for studies to include patients with more severe asthma.",

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of megesterol acetate of 128 patients did show a 4-mm decrease in Paco\n2, as a result of its known stimulatory effect on ventilation, and increased appetite associated with a 3.2-kg weight gain; but the weight was mainly fat and again, there was no benefit on respiratory muscle function or functional exercise tolerance.113\n",

Researchers at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine performed a well-designed, double-blind, RCT of a single session of multitechnique OMT versus sham therapy in 35 patients more than 65 years of age, looking for evidence of immediate measurable changes in pulmonary function. They did find statistically significant evidence of pulmonary function change, but in the wrong direction: OMT-treated patients had worsening of residual volume, indicating more air trapping, and a decrease in forced expiratory flow. The investigators concluded that further study looking at the effect of individual techniques and studying longer-term pulmonary function responses to OMT will be important to understand if COPD should be a contraindication to the use of this therapy.",
