Yet as we learn more about the virus and its mechanisms of injury, many questions remain in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients including whether a reflex reduction in immunosuppressive therapy is an appropriate management strategy. This is in part because a large study screening existing FDA approved drugs for repurposing as antiviral therapeutics reported three different immunosuppressive agents widely used in transplant recipients-tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and sirolimus-as potential therapies for Covid-19 [1] .",

It is possible therefore that immunosuppressive agents may actually confer protective effects against this particular virus, yet, the general early management strategy within the transplant community has been to reduce or withhold immunosuppression, particularly mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in transplant recipients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is also unclear whether the cytokine release syndrome that can occur in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome, is more likely or less likely to occur in patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy known to block transcriptional elements related to cytokine release. It is therefore critical to understand the clinical course and outcomes in the SARS-CoV-2 infected transplant recipients as compared to the general population so that treatment strategies can be optimized.",

NYP/WC fever clinic is a Primary Care Clinic that was set up at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic to evaluate patients in the NYP/WCM community with symptoms suspicious for Covid-19 to make rapid diagnosis and importantly separate patients of suspected of Covid-19 from the general patient population seeking primary and subspecialty care. All patients presenting to the Fever Clinic had nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected by trained personnel and the sample was tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 via Polymerase Chain Reaction using one of the following tests: cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2, Xpert\u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2, or Panther Fusion\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay. Patients were sent to the ED if they met the following criteria: (1) hemodynamic instability, (2) volume depletion, (3) hypoxia with O2 saturation <94% on RA and/or (4) acute kidney injury (as defined by an increase of creatinine to \u2265 0.5mg/dL above baseline or a 30% increase from baseline).",

Thus, the majority of our patients we managed in the outpatient setting had no change in their immunosuppression regimens.

While 16% of all Covid-19 related hospitalizations at our center had acute kidney injury (7), 51% of our hospitalized transplant patients experienced AKI. AKI in Covid-19 is thought to be a sequela from sepsis and cytokine storm syndrome; however, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the kidneys and urine of COVID-19 patients suggesting there may be a direct mechanism of renal injury as well [26, 27] . It is hypothesized that the virus can directly infect renal tubules, resulting in acute tubular damage, and induces CD68+ macrophage and complement C5b-9 mediated damage [27]. Zhang and colleagues proposed a genetic mechanism via the expression of human ACE2 in the kidney and kidney specific expression quantitative train loci of potential direct viral targets in the kidney. There are several potential reasons why the transplant population may be more predisposed to acute renal injury during Covid-19 infection. First, many kidney transplant recipients have baseline stage 2 or 3 chronic kidney disease which may have contributed to AKI, especially in the setting of an acute viral illness. Elevated tacrolimus trough levels were observed in several of our patients at admission. It has been reported that the bioavailability of tacrolimus is increased due to reduced gut transit time with diarrhea (28). The high trough levels we observed may be a consequence of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances in our study cohort. Despite the high rates of AKI in our cohort, most patients (60%) either had full or partial renal recovery at most recent follow up. Thus, while Covid-19 primarily manifests as a respiratory disease, there is clearly an important kidney component, and the long-term prognosis with regards to kidney function warrants further study. Eleven of the 39 hospitalized patients remain hospitalized at this time. The 8% in-hospital case fatality rate observed in our study is lower than the 28% mortality rate reported from a New York City transplant center and not dissimilar to the 10.2% mortality rate of non-transplant Covid -19 patients hospitalized at our center [7, 14] .

No definite conclusions can be drawn from our study regarding hydroxychloroquine efficacy in transplant patients, although majority of our outpatients did not receive hydroxychloroquine and 86% had improvement or resolution of symptoms. In light of the excellent outcome observed in our patients managed in the outpatient setting, we would recommend against routine use of hydroxychloroquine in kidney transplant recipients especially in the outpatient setting where fatal cardiac rhythm abnormalities may go undetected.Only two of our patients were enrolled in remdesivir studies, one of which did not require intubation and was discharged from the hospital and the other remains inpatient but is no longer in the ICU. While initial data on the compassionate use of remdesivir seems promising, follow up data and specific outcomes in solid organ transplant patients enrolled in ongoing trials is yet to be reported[21]. Two of our patients received IL-6 receptor antagonists. Both are still hospitalized and it unclear whether this strategy is useful in kidney transplant recipients.There is emerging data that immunosuppressive agents used in kidney transplant recipients may provide yet unappreciated benefit against this particular virus. In vitro studies have demonstrated a potential role for immunosuppressive agents, including tacrolimus, sirolimus and MMF as viral targets[1, 2, 22, 23]. Additionally, one of the most serious complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cytokine storm contributing to ARDS. Some immunomodulatory agents such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 antagonists, IVIG and steroids have been suggested to have a role in combatting this inflammatory response [24], Calcineurin inhibitors may be potentially beneficial in this setting because of their ability to reduce cytokine production via inhibition of nuclear localization of the transcription factor NFAT[25]  . It is worth noting that all patients in our study were continued on tacrolimus albeit at reduced dosage and with due All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
