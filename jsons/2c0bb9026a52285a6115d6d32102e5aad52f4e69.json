After binding to receptor, two proteolytic events are required prior to fusion of viral and host cell membranes, which results in cell entry. 1 The S protein is the principal target for the neutralizing antibody response. Some neutralizing antibodies not only block entry but trigger premature maturation and subsequent inactivation of the S protein. 2 Additionally, the S protein exhibits low affinity binding to glycans, which is important for infectivity and may function by juxtaposing cellular and viral membranes prior to receptor binding. 3 The first two thirds of genomic RNA encodes a large polyprotein (rep1a/b), which is then cleaved into 16 individual proteins, many of which are required for replication and transcription. Three of these non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 induce membrane rearrangements, including double membrane vesicles (DMV), to facilitate the formation of replication-transcription complexes (RTC) on which RNA synthesis actually occurs. 4, 5 Nonstructural proteins (nsp) inhibit host gene expression by inhibiting host mRNA translation and inducing the degradation of host mRNAs (nsp1), and by inhibiting interferon-\uf061\uf02f\uf062 (IFN-I) induction (nsp3, nsp15, nsp16).

[18] [19] [20] These results together do not support an essential role for these accessory proteins in human or camel MERS-CoV infections but rather raise the possibility that their function is most important for virus virulence in specific hosts or settings. 22 In marked contrast, while mutations in MERS-CoV have been detected in human isolates since 2012, these are, with rare exceptions, not fixed into the viral genome. 23 Rather changes in human isolates appear to reflect transmission of variants first detected in camel populations. 24 Remarkably, MERS-CoV isolates with reduced affinity for the human DPP4 receptor were detected as the Korean MERS outbreak progressed. 25, 26 This was unexpected because increased receptor affinity is predicted to emerge and enhance virulence, as occurred during the SARS epidemic in which affinity for the host cell receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 increased with time. Virus with decreased affinity for the receptor appeared to be equivalent to the parental strain in virulence and transmission, suggesting that factors other than receptor binding, such as susceptibility to proteases required for S protein processing, are relatively more important in MERS-CoV cellular entry. 1, 27 Epidemiology",

Whilst CT is more sensitive and specific than chest radiography, the high rate of underlying comorbidities in patients with MERS-CoV may create considerable difficulty in detecting disease progression due to overlapping preexisting comorbidities, such as lung fibrosis or emphysema or infectious complications.",

Several were in, or are currently undergoing in Phase I trials, in which safety and immunogenicity are examined in healthy adults. In one instance, healthy adults aged between 18-50 years were vaccinated three times with a DNA vaccine (GLS-5300) expressing a full-length consensus MERS-CoV S protein. 96 Immunoconversion as measured by S1-ELISA, neutralizing antibody and T cell responses were 94%, 43% and 76% of subjects, respectively although these all declined by 60 weeks after immunization.

Low levels of MERS-CoV RNA have been reported from asymptomatic subjects from MERS-CoV outbreaks in a Jeddah hospital after exposure to infected patients. 68 Risk factors for infection among 19 cases identified during a MERS outbreak in an all-female dormitory Riyadh in 2015 were direct contact or sharing a room with a known case. 63Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV:An analysis of eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in KSA and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017 found twenty-five percent (n=105/422) of MERS cases who acquired nosocomial infection were healthcare personnel.69 The study highlighted heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile and reproduction number (ranging from 1.0-5.7) at the start of healthcare associated outbreaks.These studies emphasize the need for standardized data collection to better understand the natural history of asymptomatic infections, and the role of mildly symptomatic HCWs in MERS-CoV nosocomial transmission, and to obtain detailed information on the specific interventions used and their impact during nosocomial outbreaks.Over the past three years, efforts from affected member states especially in health care facilities have led to improvements in implementation of standard and enhanced infection control measures, resulting in a decrease in the number of secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission in health care facilities.70",

Avoiding aerosolizing procedures in crowded hospital emergency or inpatient medical wards without adequate control measures have been recommended to decrease risk MERS-CoV human-to-human spread and environmental contamination. 52 When recognition of a nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV is delayed, hospital closure for any new admissions and preventing transfers to other hospitals have been utilized when available resources to contain the outbreak have been overwhelmed.
