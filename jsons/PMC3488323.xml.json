Generally, hospitalisation began three to five weeks following the initiation of oral antibiotics and \u2018return to baseline\u2019 occurred within two weeks of hospitalisation. Based on our data that 24% of otherwise well children in the community still have a cough associated with a viral infection at day 14 [50], we chose day 14 as the time point for this RCT. We also asked parents and clinicians about their willingness to use placebo for a period of time; 14 days was the limit with a safety exit point at day 7.",
