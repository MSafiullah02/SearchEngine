Having begun in China, globalization and travel led its spread all over the globe, overwhelming the healthcare resources and resulting in high mortality and morbidity. About 5% of adults, especially those with comorbidities, were critically ill and required intensive care unit (ICU) care [1] . People of all ages were found to be susceptible but severe illness was rare in children [2] . Most of the experience of critical care management of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is derived from the affected children of present epidemic in China, as well as from the previous coronaviral outbreaks viz. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We write this review as a guidance statement for preparedness and managing children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring intensive care in a resource-limited setting like India.",

Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over. The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation. Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms. Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers. Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission. Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.

Specimen handling for molecular testing would require Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or equivalent facilities. VOLUME 57 __ APRIL 15, 2020 RAVIKUMAR, ET AL.",
