            "text": "Considered among the most destructive of migratory pests, an adult locust can consume 2 g of vegetation per day, affecting crops, pasture and fodder. A swarm typically holds 20 to 150 million locusts per square kilometre and can migrate hundreds of kilometres per day, invading areas covering millions of square kilometres 2,3 . An active swarm, therefore, can decimate crops and pastures within a very short period of time. In the current outbreak, swarms 60-km long and 40-km wide have been reported in Kenya 1 . Devastating effects on crops and livelihoods have already been felt, but with the main cropping season approaching much worse is expected. Conditions have facilitated successful breeding of the pest and in the coming weeks the FAO predicts a 400-fold upsurge in the population of swarming, gregarious locusts in the region.",

The outbreak has its origins in 2018, when an unprecedented series of cyclones in the Arabian Peninsula enabled the warm and wet conditions the desert locust requires to breed and band undetected in remote regions. Weather systems related to the Indian Ocean Dipole facilitated their migration. Though our focus here is migration west, devastating outbreaks of the desert locust have been experienced to the east with Pakistan declaring an emergency in February.",

By the end of February, however, just US$69 million had been pledged by donors 5 .",
