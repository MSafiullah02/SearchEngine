Most of these retrospective studies have mentioned cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes as the most common associated comorbidities [4]. Cancer has also been mentioned as a comorbidity in many of these studies, however, except for the Liang et al. paper, none of the other studies have discussed cancer-related aspects in-depth like the type of cancer, stage of cancer, and treatment (chemoradiotherapy, surgery, etc.) received [3]. The study by Liang et al. (National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease group) was conducted across 575 Chinese hospitals involving 1590 COVID-19 cases. It showed that patients with cancer had a higher chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection than the normal Chinese population [3]. What is more concerning is the higher chance of requiring the intensive level of care, mechanical ventilation and potential deaths amongst the cancer patients, as compared to non-cancer patients (39% vs 8%, p = 0.0003) [3].",

The median age of patients was 59 years with 12 allogeneic HCT, the remaining 3 had autologous HCT. The majority of patients (10 cases) had symptoms related to the upper respiratory tract. Till the time of the report briefing, one patient already died due to COVID-19 [6]. Another report by Huang et al. from China discussed the grave prognosis of two post-transplant patients (transplant done for acute myeloid leukemia, and end-stage renal failure) on immunosuppressants. Both patients went to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), developed multiorgan failure and eventually died [7]. An interesting finding of low T cell count was noted in both patients which could serve as a surrogate marker for poor prognosis, but this needs confirmation by further studies.",

Regarding the gastrointestinal symptoms, we now have enough data mentioning gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting as presenting symptoms for COVID-19 disease [5]. This GI symptomatology of COVID-19 can easily be confused with other differentials like acute graft-versus-host disease, CMV colitis, mucositis, etc. With regards to the treatment, an important consideration should always be given to drug-drug interactions due to the multiple prophylactic medications (antivirals, antifungals, immunosuppressants) which transplant patients are usually on. For example, anti-COVID-19 medications can either alter the therapeutic level of many life-saving drugs-digoxin, coumadin, steroids, and immunosuppressants (e.g. lopinavir/ritonavir) or may increase the risk of rejection (e.g. beta-interferon).",

Studies on COVID-19 patients, in general, have shown lymphopenia as a poor prognostic factor [10]. In HCT, interpretation of lymphopenia is not straight forward and multiple other non-COVID-19 causes like non-SARS-CoV-2 viral infections, conditioning chemotherapy, pending bone marrow recovery, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, etc. need to be considered and ruled out. Similarly, Huang et al. suggested a low T cell count as a possible marker of poor prognosis in post-transplant recipients with COVID-19 [7]. However, their patients were already on steroids, cyclosporin-A and mycophenolate mofetil which can also lead to T cell depletion. Hence, at present, we do not have an ideal marker in cancer/HCT patients that can be used confidently to predict the clinical course or outcome of COVID-19.",

A recent report by Pagano et al. mentioned how the number of blood donations went down significantly when the US administration promoted social distancing, and school and university closures to contain community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [12]. By implementing measures like judicious use of blood products, cancellations of elective surgeries and public awareness, Pagano et al. were able to overcome the scarcity of blood products. This is something very crucial for transplant patients because they need blood and blood components in amounts which are exceedingly higher than in routine patients. One can always ask if SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via blood transfusions? At least, to date, there is no documentation of transfusion-related coronavirus reaction in the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as during the past outbreaks of MERS and SARS.",
