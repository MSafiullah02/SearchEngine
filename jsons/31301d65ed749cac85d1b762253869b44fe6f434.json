To ground our scenarios in reality -to ensure that they were not too far-fetched -we did a \"technology check\" (are the technologies referenced in the scenarios probable?) and a \"reality check\" (are there press reports of events similar to those mentioned in the scenarios?). Then, all of the partners reviewed all of the scenarios in order to eliminate doubtful points, unnecessary wordage, irrelevancies, etc., and to sharpen them to illustrate the points we wanted to emphasise. Once the scenarios were \"stable\", we performed our analysis of them, including a legal analysis. We presented the scenarios and our analyses at a second workshop in order to benefit from the comments of other experts.",

Within the western legal system, privacy is primarily an issue of international and constitutional law, protected by explicit provisions, both in international human rights treaties and in the distinct national constitutions. The first provision to mention is Article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 15 although, strictly speaking, it has no legally binding force. Article 17 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) also seeks to protect privacy. 16 And finally, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) 17 confers respect for private life. Both the ICCPR and the ECHR are binding treaties. Article 17 of the ICCPR and Article 8 of the ECHR 18 directly affect national legal systems. Both can be invoked and applied by national judges. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also protects privacy (Article 7) and personal data (Article 8) of individuals. 19 The protection of the private home together with the protection of privacy is guaranteed at the European level by Article 8 of the ECHR. 20 There is no explicit mention of a right to have data protected in the ECHR, but the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (the Strasbourg Court) leaves no mistake about this right being incorporated in the more general right to protection of privacy. Issues regarding violations of the home are also seen as privacy issues and vice versa. These rights are not absolute. Exceptions are possible (Article 8(2)), however, they have to fulfil several criteria: the restriction must be foreseen by law (the formal criterion); it must be necessary in a democratic society (the necessity criterion); it can only be used to achieve one of the specific and limited goals set out in Article 8 of the ECHR, including public security and the safeguarding of rights and freedoms of others (the legitimacy criterion). The Strasbourg Court has ruled that any action must be useful, indispensable and proportionate to achieve the set goal (the proportionality criterion). The last standard implies that the established goal could not be reached through measures that would have had a lesser impact on the guaranteed freedom of the individual concerned.",

According to Article 8 of the ECHR and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, privacy is a legal concept to ensure non-interference in individual matters by the state and other powerful actors. It works as a shield to protect the opacity ( anonymity) of the individual. Opacity is linked to the recognition of human rights, individual autonomy and self-determination. Normative in nature, opacity tools can be distinguished from transparency, which aims not against the power, but at channelling or controlling the power of the state and others. Transparency tools provide for a system of checks and balances and procedural safeguards. Interference into one's autonomy is then allowed, but under control. 23 This is the standpoint of the data protection laws, which also aim at protecting privacy. In sum, data protection is not prohibitive. The data protection regulations created a legal framework whereby the processing of personal data is in principle allowed and legal 24 (and therefore mainly belongs to tools of transparency) subject to safeguards protecting individuals, promoting accountability by government and private data holders, and providing data subjects with an opportunity to contest inaccurate or abusive record-holding practices. The rationale behind data protection in the public sector is the knowledge that authorities can easily infringe privacy and that in all administrative systems is an urge to collect, store and use data, an urge which must be curtailed by legal regulation. A similar rationale explains the European option to regulate data processing in the private sector.",

            "text": "Within the European Union, the main source of regulation in the field is the Data Protection Directive, 28 together with legislation implementing it nationally. The Directive applies to the processing of data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person or \"personal data\". 29 Anonymous data do not fall under the scope of the Directive. 30 The Directive grants every person the right not to be subject to a decision that produces legal effects concerning him or significantly affects him and that is based solely on automated processing of data. 31 The Directive applies to both the private and public sectors. It does not apply to processing of personal data by a natural person for purely personal and domestic purposes, and to data concerning legal persons. It also does not apply to processing carried out for purposes of public security, defence and national security or in the course of State activities in areas of criminal law and other activities that do not come within the scope of Community law. 32 The Data Protection Directive and national data protection laws in general provide for a number of requirements in order to legally process personal information. 33 Those are twofold: on the one hand, there exists a series of rights for individuals 34 such as the right to receive certain information whenever data are collected, the right 27 The United Nations Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal Data Files, adopted by General Assembly resolution 45/95 of 14 December 1990, are a more recent international instrument. We do not discuss these UN guidelines, because they are overshadowed by the other regulations in Europe. 28 Directive 95/46/EC. 29 It is not always clear what should be understood as \"personal data\" or when data are anonymous. See Chapter 5, section 5.3.4, subsection on \"Data protection and profiling: a natural pair\". 30 However, the problem of anonymous data can be relative in some circumstances: the notion of \"identifiable\" in the European Directive is, unlike other international data protection texts, very extensive. Data that at first glance do not look like personal data can very often lead to an individual. Even if a processor wants data to be anonymous, they may not. The definition of \"identifiable\" is so broad that data can be considered personal as long as the controller himself is still able to identify the persons behind the data. Staying out of reach of European data protection is only possible through maximum anonymity. 31 The Data Protection Directive, Article 15. See also sections 3.2.8.4 and 3.5.8.1 as well as Chapter 5, section 5.3.4, subsection on \"Data protection and profiling: a natural pair\". 32 The Data Protection Directive, Article 3. There is now a debate about whether to extend data protection to third pillar issues: See Proposal for a Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, COM ( 34 See the discussion on the right to be informed in sections 3.2.8.4, 3.2.8.7 and 3.4.8.4; the right to consult the data, the right to have data corrected and the obligation on data controllers to collect and keep relevant, correct and up-to-date data in sections 3.2.8.2, 3.3.8.3 and 3.5.8.2 and the right to object to certain types of data processing in section 3.5.8.1. of access to the data and, if necessary, the right to have the data corrected and the right to object to certain types of data processing. Also, data protection law generally demands good data management practices by the data controllers and imposes a series of obligations 35 : the obligation to use personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes (finality or purpose specification principle), the obligation to guarantee the confidentiality and security of the data against accidental or unauthorised access or manipulation and, in some cases, the obligation to notify a specific independent supervisory body before carrying out certain types of data processing. These laws provide specific safeguards or special procedures to be applied in the case of transfers of data abroad. Any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the individuals (fairness principle). All data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to a purpose for which they are collected and/or further processed (proportionality principle). There is also a prohibition on processing sensitive data. To be legitimate, personal data may only be processed if the data subject has unambiguously given his consent. It may be processed without his consent under limited conditions provided by law. 36 The challenge for data protection law in relation to AmI mainly concerns the reconciliation of the principles of data protection law with the concept of AmI. This challenge emerges because AmI and its supporting technologies need personal data and profiles to work. In order to provide people with information (enhanced goods and services), AmI needs to process personal information. 37 The decreasing cost of these technologies as well as the increasing emergence of customers willing to pay for these services are already noticeable trends.",

The issue of consent is further discussed in sections 3.3.8.4 and 3.4.8.2. 37 However, this means that not only should concepts, scenarios, practices and techniques of AmI be tested on their compliance with data protection law, but also data protection law itself can and should be put into question if necessary, e.g., where some data protection rights cannot be reconciled on a reasonable ground with good practices and techniques of AmI that are preferable and desired by the user. public communication services, whereas the Data Protection Directive applies to both public and non-public services. The Privacy & Electronic Communications Directive not only protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, but also the legitimate interests of legal persons, whereas the Data Protection Directive only offers protection to natural persons. Neither of the directives applies to activities concerning public security, defence, state security and the activities of the state in areas of criminal law. The Privacy & Electronic Communications Directive stipulates that Member States may, for reasons of national security, defence, public security and the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, enact legislation providing for the retention of traffic and location data pertaining to all forms of electronic communications by telecommunications operators. 39 It imposes security and confidentiality obligations on service providers 40 and foresees specific rules for traffic 41 and location 42 data and provides for limits in processing such information. 39 Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC, Official Journal L 105, 13 April 2006. This retention possibility has been firmly criticised by EPIC (www.epic.org) and Privacy International (www.privacyinternational.org): \"Although this data retention provision is supposed to constitute an exception to the general regime of data protection established by the Directive, the ability of governments to compel Internet service providers and telecommunications companies to store all data about all of their subscribers can hardly be construed as an exception to be narrowly interpreted. The practical result is that all users of new communications technologies are now considered worthy of scrutiny and surveillance in a generalized and preventive fashion for periods of time that States' legislatures or governments have the discretion to determine. \" 40 See also sections 3.2.8.3 and 3.3.8.3. 41 \" '[T]raffic data' means any data processed for the purpose of the conveyance of a communication on an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof\" (Article 2). The level of protection of traffic data depends on the purpose of the processing: (1) transmission of communication, (2) billing or (3) marketing electronic communication as well as providing of value-added services, e.g., tourist information, route guidance, traffic information and weather forecasts, and generally may be processed by the service provider to the extent and for the duration necessary for that purpose. In any of these cases, processing of traffic data must be restricted to what is necessary for the purposes of such activities and must be restricted to persons acting under the authority of the network or service provider. In any of these cases, if data are processed for a longer time than for the transmission, the user or subscriber must be informed of the duration of such processing (Article 6 of the Privacy & Electronic Communications Directive). 42 \" 'Location data' means any data processed in an electronic communications network, indicating the geographic position of the terminal equipment of a user of a publicly available electronic AmI will cause a blurring of the boundaries between spaces and activities. The first scenario gives an example of a father, working for a security company mostly from his private home. New communication technology facilitates teleworking and makes it possible to deal with private business from an office. Boundaries between what is private and what is professional will become less distinctive and more permeable than today. What are the consequences of such ambiguous situations from a privacy point of view? How can a distinction still be made between private and professional, private and public? Such situations result in doubts about the extent to which privacy is legally protected in professional contexts, especially when employees work outside the office.",

            "text": "The European Court of Human Rights has clarified that the protection of private life does not exclude the professional life, and that it is not limited to the life within the home or family. In Niemitz v. Germany (23 November 1992), the Court stated that there is no reason why the notion of \"private life\" should be taken to exclude activities of a professional or business nature. Moreover, the Court added that this view is supported by the fact that \"it is not always possible to distinguish clearly which of an individual's activities form part of his professional or business life and which do not.\" In Halford v. United Kingdom (27 May 1997), the Court introduced the criterion of \"reasonable expectations of privacy\". Accordingly, Miss Halford, a senior officer whose telephone calls were intercepted without warning, was granted privacy protection in her office space, although not absolutely. The protection of privacy at work remains one of the grey areas in European human rights law. The case of Halford, a senior officer with privileges, is in itself not a typical case. More case law is needed to clarify the reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace. It should also be borne in mind that surveillance of the individual after a suspicion has been raised raises fewer concerns than the general surveillance at workplace, in a public building or at home. It is unclear how and if the reasonable expectation of privacy would apply in AmI situations as described in Scenario 1. While being always online, would we be able to talk with any expectation of privacy at all? An additional problem is the lack of clarity regarding the consequences of privacy violations. The European Court of Human Rights is unwilling to reject evidence obtained through privacy violations. In cases such as Khan (2000) and P.H. & P.G. against the United Kingdom (2001), the Strasbourg court decided that a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR had taken place, but it nevertheless accepted the evidence found in violation of Article 8 of the ECHR in a criminal process. communications service\" (Article 2). Location data may only be processed (a) when they are made anonymous or (b) with the consent of the users or subscribers to the extent and for the duration necessary for the provision of a value-added service. When consent has been obtained, the user shall be given the possibility to withdraw his consent for the processing of such data at any time and must continue to have the possibility, using a simple means and free of charge, of temporarily refusing the processing of such data for each connection to the network or for each transmission of a communication (Article 9 of the Privacy & Electronic Communications Directive). Some national courts have followed this line of reasoning. In Belgium, there are examples of the erosion of privacy law in the workplace: The Belgian Data Protection Act (1992, revised in 1998) and the Collective Labour Agreement 68 of 16 June 1998 foresee that strict procedures of information and negotiation must be followed when cameras are installed in the workplace. Thus, employees must be informed when an employer installs cameras. The Cour de Cassation, the highest Belgian court, argued in a recent case that Articles 6 and 8 of the ECHR do not necessarily mean that the infringement of the information and negotiation procedure laid down in data protection law voids the evidence obtained with a hidden camera (in this case, a theft by an employee). 43 Most probably AmI will challenge our understanding of the terms \"home\" and \"communication\" and require a reinterpretation of the term private life, since the distinction between private and professional life might become further blurred. It is unclear how and if the criterion of \"reasonable expectations of privacy\" will be applied further by the European courts. It is equally unclear how this criterion will apply in an AmI world. If the privacy case law does not offer sufficient and clear privacy protection of AmI environments, additional legal and constitutional protection may be warranted.",

Creating profiles via DRM systems may conflict with some principles expressed in Article 6 of the Data Protection Directive, 44 like, inter alia, fairness and lawfulness, purpose specification and finality, data accuracy and proportionality.

The Software Directive only protects against the putting into circulation of devices that have no other function than circumventing protective measures, which is an important limitation.

            "text": "Many Member States have no criminal sanctions for violation of the duty to foresee sufficient security safeguards. Especially when unique identifiers are being collected and processed, lack of protection could be considered as a criminal act. One can foresee specific measures on the use of biometric data and to prohibit badly protected or too risky use of biometrics. 51 Ricardo was able to enter his father's office and profile relatively easily. Perhaps he was able to hack the profile and view the confidential information (both private and professional information) due to defects in the security system (hardware or software). The question is whether the provider of the security software can be held liable and to what extent this liability can be waived in general contractual terms and conditions. Today, software products' licence agreements clearly indicate that the software is purchased without liability for the loss of information. In this scenario, it is not clear if the defects, if any, are linked to the software or to the hardware. On the basis of actual regulation, this is important: Article 1 of the Directive on liability for defective products 52 provides that the producer of a product is liable for damage caused by a defect in his product. A product, however, is only defective when it does not provide the \"safety which a person is entitled to expect taking all circumstances into account, including: (a) the presentation of the product; (b) the use to which it could reasonably be expected that the product would be put; (c) the time when the product was put into circulation. A product shall not be considered defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into circulation.\" 53 A product is defined as \"all movables, with the exception of primary agricultural products and game, even though incorporated into another movable or into an immovable\". 54 It is 51 De Hert, P., \"Biometrics: legal issues and implications\", Background paper for EC JRC -Institute of Prospective Technological Studies, Seville, January 2005. 52 Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, Official Journal L 210, 7 August 1985. 53 Article 6 of the Directive on liability for defective products. 54 Article 2 of the Directive on liability for defective products. unclear today whether this Directive applies to defective software and/or hardware, and whether the Directive could be invoked in the case of ICT products. Also, it is not clear if and to what extent economic damages fall under the concept of damage (injury) in the sense of the Directive. 55 From a consumer perspective, there are reasons to argue in favour of a full application of the Directive to the issues mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The strict liability regime of the Directive on liability for defective products facilitates establishing the producer's liability, since no proof of fault is required: demonstrating that the product is defective is sufficient. Since the security system did not prevent the son from using his father's profile, we could consider the system to be defective. An important question is, of course, which producer caused the defect and how to find him. Article 3 of the Directive provides for the joint liability of producers and suppliers. It states clearly that, when the producer of a product cannot be identified (which might be a serious problem in an AmI world), the supplier is liable unless \"he informs the injured person, within a reasonable time, of the identity of the producer or of the person who supplied him with the product\". On the basis of Article 5, two or more persons shall be liable jointly and severally when they are liable for the same damage. This implies that if several service providers are coresponsible for the defect, the victim can claim the total damages from one of them, probably his direct supplier.",

National data protection rules may provide some safeguards (e.g., the Belgian national data protection law is applicable in such circumstances). National data protection rules have to be in line with the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data no. 108. With regard to police, security and defence issues, however, the provisions of the 1981 Convention are very sober. The 1981 Convention contains no provision comparable to Article 15 of the Data Protection Directive providing the right not to be subject to a decision that produces legal effects concerning the data subject or significantly affects him and that is solely based on such an automated processing of personal data. This is only partly compensated for in Recommendation No. R (87)15 58 Articles 6, 12 and 15 of the Data Protection Directive. 59 In the Hague Programme of October 2005, the Commission proposed to substitute the principle that data can only be transmitted to another Member State on the conditions established by the state that holds the information with the \"principle of availability\". Under the latter principle, the authorities of any Member State would have the same right of access to information held by any other authority in the Union as applies to state authorities within the state where the data are held. According to the Hague Programme, the Commission made a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the exchange of information under the principle of availability, COM (2005) 490 final. http://europa.eu.int/eur -lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0490en01.pdf regulating the use of personal data in the police sector (17 September 1987). The recommendation, a \"soft law\" instrument developed by experts in the context of the 1981 Council of Europe Convention, is not legally binding and was conceived in an era that was unaware of (or unwilling to accept) new forms of systematic and intelligence-led policing. If our police forces were to apply the recommendation today, they would have no choice except to collect data only when there are sufficient grounds to do so and to destroy such data as soon as possible. Clearly, this is not in line with current policing and antiterrorism policies and strategies.",

The Data Retention Directive 60 provides for at least six months and a maximum of two years for data retention necessary for the purpose of investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime. The data to be retained are the traffic and location data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user. It applies to legal entities and natural persons both. However, it does not apply to the content of communication. 61 The Directive does not indicate what is regarded as a serious crime, except to say that it applies to serious crimes as defined in national laws. It also states that the necessity and proportionality principles must be defined in national laws in accordance with international rules. 62 The respect for the freedoms and fundamental rights of persons concerned are expressed in recitals to the Directive. 63 The Directive also sanctions the access to and transmission of the retained data, which is not permitted under national laws adopted pursuant to this Directive, and provides for the right to compensation in case of damages caused by any unlawful processing of data. 64 Moreover, the European Commission has proposed a third-pillar data protection instrument. 65 There is a strong need for a coherent instrument for the protection of personal data under the fields now covered by Titles V and VI of the EU Treaty covering current police practices such as profiling. A framework favourable to profiling practices as described in the scenario is not unthinkable, although it should be balanced with adequate guarantees for the data subjects. Defining the rights of the data subject in the context of data processing in a criminal investigation is one of the aims of the draft Framework Decision on the protection of personal data in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. 66 Such rights are defined in Chapter IV of the proposal. The proposal envisages a data subject's right to information, 67 when data are collected with his knowledge as well as when such data are not obtained from him or are collected without his being aware of such collection. 68 Necessarily, there are some restrictions on such disclosures. 69 The proposal also foresees the right of access, rectification, erasure or blocking of data, 70 also subject to some restriction. 71 This provision, analogous to Article 12 of the Data Protection Directive, should allow Paul to know why he is suspected by the police and might allow him to prove he is not the person for whom the cyber police are searching. Moreover, the right to rectification, blocking and erasure of data would allow him to correct his profile as created by the cyber police. Article 22 of the proposal would require that any rectification, erasure or blocking be notified to third parties to whom the data have also been disclosed, such as Paul's employer or other state agencies. In addition, the proposal contains provisions relating to the principles of fairness and lawfulness, purpose specification, legitimacy and proportionality, and to data quality. 72 The obligation to ensure the high quality of data is crucial in order to make sure profiles built on those data are correct and effective as a tool of modern investigation practices.",

When electronic contact details of consumers are obtained in the context of the sale of a product or a service, these electronic contact details may be used by the same entrepreneur for direct marketing of his own similar products or services, provided, however, that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use. The opt-out mechanism has several disadvantages. The data subject has to declare specifically that he does not want to receive these messages, which puts a burden on him. He might not know who sends the information 89 and he might have to opt out from a number of personalised message systems. When he opts out, he might also lose important information and services. This limits his freedom to opt out to a great extent. People are even considered suspicious when they decide not to use certain services. Some solution to the above-mentioned problems with location-based communication are foreseen by Article 9(2) of Privacy & Electronic Communications Directive which says that the user has to be able to temporarily refuse processing of location data using simple means and free of charge. That would allow the user to shield himself from location-based ( commercial) communication, while still being able to receive other useful information. However, this provision does not protect users against broadcast advertisements, nor does it provide a solution for not losing other location-based information (e.g., \"locate my friend\" applications) when using the possibility afforded by Article 9(2) to protect oneself against commercial messages.",

This is difficult to prove.

Since it was relatively easy for a hacker to access the system, the condition of proving defect might be fulfilled. Moreover, the Directive on liability for defective products contains rules that allow the victim to react against the supplier of the defective good, when the producer cannot be found. When the damage is caused by defects in the products or services of different suppliers, Article 5 makes it possible to claim all of the damage from one of the suppliers.

If not, Article 6 of the Rome Convention contains specific rules on labour contracts. The European Union has recently adopted a regulation which unifies the rules on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, the so-called Rome II Regulation. 117 The basic rule under the Regulation is that the law applicable should be the law of State where the direct damaged occurred (lex loci damni). 118 However, the Regulation allows for exceptions to this general rule. Such \"escape clauses\" seek to provide a more adequate solution in cases when the tort or delict is mostly connected with the country other than the one of the lex loci damni. This will be the case when both parties have their habitual place of residence in the same State. Moreover, if it is clear from the circumstances of the case that the tort or delict is manifestly more closely connected with the law of the country other than that of the lex loci damni or of habitual residence, the law of this other country should apply. 119 Special rules apply in the case of some specific torts or delicts, e.g., in the case of product liability or in the case of infringements of intellectual property. The parties can choose the law by agreement, though some limitations are provided. 120 The Rome II Regulation excludes from its application a number of fields, inter alia, the law on companies and non-contractual obligations arising out of the violation of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation. 121 The Regulation shall apply from January 2009. The competent court in this scenario would be determined by the Brussels Regulation. 122 As in the case of applicable law, the parties have the possibility to determine in their contract which courts will be competent (Articles 23 and 24) . The basic principle of this Regulation is that a defendant can be sued in the Member State of his domicile (Article 2). If the defendant is domiciled outside the European Union, this Regulation will not provide a solution for problems of jurisdiction (Article 4). In such situations, national legislation will determine the adequate forum. Article 2 has another disadvantage. When a user wants to sue an AmI services supplier, the service supplier will have the advantage of being sued at home. He might determine his domicile to ensure a beneficial jurisdiction.",

Hacking is a criminal offence and Article 5(4) of the Brussels Regulation provides that a civil claim for damage or restitution which is based on an act giving rise to criminal proceedings can be brought in the court seized of those criminal proceedings, to the extent that that the court has jurisdiction under its own law to entertain civil proceedings. Since several persons might be coresponsible for the accident, there could be several parallel proceedings. Since this would make the issue more complex and expensive for the parties, Article 6 provides for the possibility of consolidating claims so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings, in the court of domicile of any of the (many) defendants. This allows the plaintiff to sue the different defendants before one single court. However, not all claims from the same factual situation may fulfil conditions set up by the Article 6.

It only applies to contracts between sellers or suppliers and consumers (natural persons) and, in particular, only to contractual terms that have not been individually negotiated by the parties.

A government data processing has to meet the criteria of the legal framework of the specific administrative authority and comply with its statutory powers. On top of that, each action by the authorities has to meet the criteria of the public interest. Mutatis mutandis, this also applies to the processing operations that the authorities manage or delegate. As a result, government data processing is not justified when it is not necessary for the exercise of a specific power of the administration concerned. It is just as unjustified when government data processing operations constitute a disproportionate invasion of privacy, since protection of privacy is, to a great extent, part of the public interest. There should be less invasive methods available to achieve the same goal. In addition, governmental data processing also has to respect Article 8 of the ECHR. The restrictions set out in the second paragraph of that article fully apply. This implies, that apart from the aforementioned legality and proportionality requirement, governmental data processing must be necessary in a democracy and be \"in the interest of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\". This means that a processing operation is not justified simply because it is executed by or for the government. National rules need to make this meticulously clear.

Again, two aspects intertwine. In the first place, the ultimate purpose of the processing should be lawful. If the processing is undertaken by a legal person, its corporate purposes will be taken into account as an additional touchstone. Legal persons can only undertake actions to achieve the goals laid out in their articles of association. The processing operation has to be congruent with those. Second, the processing operation must be clearly necessary and indispensable to achieve the set purpose of the processor. Is it possible to achieve that purpose through other means? In regard to privacy, is this the least harmful way? Proportionality is essential. The interests at stake have to be carefully balanced. In each case, the concrete interests facing each other have to be carefully evaluated. A purely commercial purpose that results in an invasion of privacy (e.g., the processing of personal data for direct marketing sales) has to be judged differently (and more severely) than data processing necessary to maintain public health, freedom of speech or, for that matter, the running of a sports club.",

Not everyone in our society has the same possibilities. Data processing is mostly entrenched in relationships in which the data subject is the weak party and the data flow is often one-way. Most of the time, the data subject needs something (e.g., credit, health insurance) and is almost forced to give consent. In the end, consent is often turned into a pure formality without offering any guarantee. Second, the general framework of the Data Protection Directive leaves doubt about what processing operations can be justified solely based on the consent of the data subject. If no consent is given, the other legitimacy grounds in themselves seem to span the whole range of possibilities (especially Article 7 (f) discussed above). Unless one assumes that such consent would legitimise disproportionate and illegitimate processing -which is questionable. It is problematic to invoke the consent of a data subject in order to justify a disproportionate processing. In penal law, the consent of a victim does not erase the criminal character of an action. Mandatory secrecy is not affected when a party gives consent to make something public. The mutual consent between parties on illegal agreements does not yield a legal agreement. As a result, the unambiguous consent of the data subjects is only one of the aspects that affect the considerations of the different interests.",

Indeed, Member States must proscribe the processing of \"personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life\" (Article 8(1) of the Data Protection Directive). In those cases, a fundamental data processing prohibition applies because it endangers not only privacy, but also the principle of non-discrimination. Yet this fundamental ban also allows for exemptions. The processing of sensitive data is then possible, inter alia, when the data subject has given his explicit consent. 137 Thus, the \"explicit consent\" to the processing of such sensitive information would make it legitimate. The hospital example shows that this consent is often not 137 Article 8 allows other exceptions for processing of sensitive data, i.e., those where the processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and specific rights of the controller in the field of employment law; or is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or is carried out, with appropriate guarantees, by a foundation, association or other nonprofit-seeking body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to its persons or those who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed to a third party without consent; or relates to data made public by the data subject or is necessary for legal claims. The Member States can add extra exemptions to the general prohibition. freely given because the data subject is in a subordinate situation. He is subject to the power of the data processor and controller, who possess a good or a service one wants. In this scenario, the data subject is dependent on the hospital (and therefore will mostly give disproportionate access to his personal data), but also the hospital is dependent on the insurance companies that require hospitals to enforce access to the complete records of their patients (and therefore the hospitals will mostly ask for disproportionate access to the personal data).",

That might imply that a patient would need to grant access to his medical records by the hospital, to enable the latter to provide him with the treatment. In any event, the hospital is still obliged to respect the proportionality principle and not to process more data than necessary.

Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Provisions establishing this principle prohibit using some of the characteristics (grounds for prohibited discrimination as enumerated in the legal documents) in decision-making. This principle would apply to decisions taken in the AmI environment as well, including automated decisions. Non-discrimination provisions do not prohibit the use of such data for other purposes (data collection, profiling), nor do they address possible use of such characteristics, but only the decision actually made. Those aspects are remedied to some extent, however, by data protection legislation, which establishes a prohibitive and more severe regime for the processing of sensitive data not as an expression of the will to protect privacy, but to remedy the danger of discrimination that may arise from the processing of such sensitive data. On the other hand, antidiscrimination law could also have the ability to fill gaps in the legal provisions of more specific instruments (such as data protection law). Prohibition of discrimination applies to all situations based on the forbidden criteria, not only in the case of identifiable individuals (which is a limitation the data protection law) but also anonymous members of a group (group profiling). 140",

It turns out that DMC had been profiling virtually everyone in the United States, Europe and many other countries around the world. They have the world's fastest and most powerful computers with billions and billions of records from all sorts of services, including governments. 151 DMC had been processing all these records from different sources, including the latest ambient intelligence networks, and linking them together so that it was able to build up comprehensive profiles on every one of us. 152 \"Then, according to the FT, DMC discovered that someone had broken into its supercomputers and copied data on a lot of people. For a few weeks, DMC didn't say anything to anybody, 153 but then there was a big spike in the number of identity theft cases. People with credit cards were seeing all kinds of purchases on their monthly statements for stuff they hadn't bought. A lot more people and companies were reporting that they were being blackmailed with threats of releases of embarrassing information unless they paid up. The FT got wind of this big increase in credit card fraud and extortion, and was able to trace the source back to a theft of data from DMC.",

A principal source of these data is the AmI networks that are able to generate far more information than ever before on individuals, their behaviours, habits, contacts, comings and goings, purchases, etc. A second success factor is that DMC has developed an algorithm for sifting through and processing all this data so that it is able to sell its products and services to a wide range of clients.

As a result, an early warning system is set up that already gives suggestions after only five per cent of the data has been processed. Experienced hotel staff know how to deal with such preliminary profiles but in this case the lady in question was refused a hotel room. The situation was not rectified until the following day.

Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that inaccurate or incomplete data are erased or rectified. Article 12 of the Directive also provides for the right to access and rectify data. It says that every data subject has a right to obtain from the controller \"without constraint at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense: confirmation as to whether or not data relating to him are being processed and information at least as to the purposes of the processing, the categories of data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed; communication to him in an intelligible form of the data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their source; knowledge of the logic involved in any automatic processing of data concerning him at least in the case of the automated decisions\". On the basis of Article 12 (b), the data subject has to obtain from the controller \"as appropriate the rectification, erasure or blocking of data the processing of which does not comply with the provisions of this Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the data\". This makes it possible to correct an incorrect profile. Also, the data subject can ask on the basis of Article 12 (c) of the Data Protection Directive that any rectification, erasure or blocking carried out be notified to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed. Such guarantees do not, however, entirely protect the data subject against use of the incorrect profile, especially since enforcing such a right can be difficult for the average user, or he may not know that an incorrect profile is being processed before the damage occurs. However, Member States are obliged to determine the processing operations likely to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects and check that these processing operations are examined prior to their start. The supervisory authority is also obliged to carry out prior checks following receipt of a notification from the controller or by the data protection official, who, in cases of doubt, must consult the supervisory authority. 195 Nevertheless, an ex-post guarantee of the data subject's rights is also necessary. In scene 1, the MEP recounts the story about a friend who was refused a room because the hotel had inaccurate data about her and did not respect several of the conditions described above. Unfortunately, it will be difficult 195 Articles 18, 20 and 28 of the Data Protection Directive. to hold the hotel liable for the incorrect profiling, not only because the profiling error arose from different data providers, but also because the causal link between the error and the damage will be difficult to establish. The difficulties are compounded by the fact that evidential issues (procedures) as well as tort rules and prerequisites (as causation) are regulated by national laws. It will also be difficult to meet the traditional tort law preconditions in such situations. The crucial question is: who should be held responsible or liable for the damage caused by the use of incorrect data? The error could have been caused by input of incorrect information. Or the hotel might have created a bad profile through misuse of correct information. According to Article 23 of the Data Protection Directive, however, any person who has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful processing operation or violation of national data protection law is entitled to receive compensation from the controller for the damage suffered. This is a strict liability, but the national law may exempt the controller from this strict liability if he proves that he is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. This means that a reversal of the onus of proof may be foreseen: the data controller may be allowed to prove that he is not responsible for the damage",

The processing of personal data must therefore be carried out with the consent of the person concerned \"or be necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract binding on the data subject, or as a legal requirement, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, or in the legitimate interests of a natural or legal person.\" The processing must also relate to data that are \"adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\" Not all concerts create safety problems. The concert organiser will need to ask the people attending a concert for their consent to use intrusive technologies. New technological developments such as those described in the scenario offer possible solutions to the problems of striking a balance between traditional privacy and security. Their use has to be carefully assessed within the framework of human rights law.

After phoning the hospital, Heike is informed that her parents are receiving medical treatment. After Martin Schmitt has been thoroughly examined, he is allowed to leave the emergency room and turn on his communication devices again. 95 He immediately calls his daughter. Heike: Hello? Oh, it's you, dad. Thank goodness! Are you all right? How's mom? What happened? Martin: Our bus had an accident, and your mom was slightly injured, nothing serious. She has a slight concussion and I have a few scratches. Nothing to worry about, believe me. Heike: Can I talk to her? Martin: Sorry, honey, but she's still being treated and the doctors said she should not be disturbed. Heike: By the way, Aunt Anna called me just a few minutes ago. She was totally freaking out because she received the same alarm messages as me. Apparently she became so excited that her HMD even alarmed her doctor! Martin: Oh no, I forgot to take Anna off the list of people to be automatically notified in an emergency. Please call her and try to calm her down. Listen, I want to go back to your mother. I'll call you later. Just wanted to let you know everything's okay. As it is already past midnight when Martin finally leaves the hospital, he decides to send a video message to his daughter instead of calling her. In his hotel room, Martin sets up his mobile phone in front of him and starts recording his message. He also attaches a short clip showing Barbara in the hospital, saying a few words to reassure her daughter. Martin had ignored the ban on using mobile recording devices in the hospitals and filmed a short video-sequence of his wife anyway. Dear Heike! As you can see, I'm absolutely fine. And your mother is recovering quickly. She will be released tomorrow morning. But let me tell you what happened from the beginning. Scene 2: Travel preparation and check-in procedure for public transportation Your Mom and I had completed travel preparations way ahead of time. So there was no need to get stressed out. And thanks to the travel-assistance procedure of the AmI environment in our home in Murnau, this time we even thought of recharging our PWCs and HMDs early enough to avoid losing \"our identity\" like on our last trip. In Munich, I experienced an awkward situation after I located a former colleague of mine using the \"friend-locator\" function (LBS) of my PWC. 96 I just wanted to say \"Hi\", but when I walked up to him, I was surprised to see that he had a good-looking, younger woman with him who obviously was not his wife. He blushed, mumbled a few words and disappeared in the crowd. It seems difficult to keep secrets these days \u2026 At Munich station, we met our old friends Brigitte and Peter as planned. The four of us proceeded to meet up with the travel group in the new bus terminal, just next to the station. Alessandra, our Italian tour manager, introduced herself and welcomed us to the tour and we finally started to pass through the security gates in order to board the bus. I guess I'll never feel comfortable with all these safety measures you have to endure when travelling: biometric ID verification, 97 detectors for drugs and explosives, etc., especially if they reject you erroneously. 98 One of our fellow travellers, Michael from Baden-Baden, was denied access to the boarding area of the terminal, even though he had a valid ticket and had the receipt from his travel agent! 99 Apparently, some kind of data mismatch between his personal ID, the e-ticket and the information stored on the central server had caused the problem. The security personnel at the terminal were absolutely stubborn and unwilling to make an exception, despite several interventions by Alessandra and Peter, who is a good friend of Michael. The officials urged Alessandra to accept the situation 96 Paciga, M., and H. Lutfiya, 2005. 97 Bolle, R.M., J.H. Connell, S. Pankanti, N.K. Ratha and A.W.

He escaped from the bus crash without a scratch but he was almost given an injection just because he had picked up someone else's HMD and not his own.But something really tragic occurred with Monika Klein, a nice 84-year-old lady from Salzburg. She was one of those whose health insurance refused to pay for an update of the HMD to the latest model; the paramedics had neither her patient record nor her current vital data. When one of the paramedics walked around and talked to those who were not on his automatically-produced list, she told him that she was not in pain, only exhausted. Because there weren't enough ambulances at the scene, they left her sitting on a bench next to the road. Since the introduction of HMDs, these guys depend too much on the technology. They are not even able to practise the simplest diagnosis. Otherwise they would have diagnosed that Mrs Klein had internal bleeding. I heard that when they finally decided to take her to the hospital, one of the last to go, she suddenly lost consciousness and passed away before the ambulance reached the hospital.Scene 5: Ambient intelligence and medical careAfter we arrived at the hospital, I had a fierce argument with the lady at the reception who complained that she was not able to get full access to my health and insurance record. The doctors, she said, were unable to help me if I wouldn't disclose my complete data to the hospital.Heike, you probably remember that I had forbidden the health services to give away certain data because I had been spammed with so many drug adverts last year after that scandal over the illegal trading of personal health data. I saw no necessity to give the hospital complete access since I only had some scratches. However, I had to sign a statement that the hospital is not liable for any impairment resulting from their treatment.I really wonder if the benefits of automated health care are really worth this mess. I promise to keep you posted. Say hi to George and hug the kids for us! Bye for now!",

The sensors and actuators in the boardroom slightly adjust the air conditioning and lighting to the midpoint between the president and secretary's preferences. The president nods a slight greeting to the company secretary who can see his boss is preoccupied. A few seconds later, the vice presidents enter one by one and take their seats, and the lighting and air conditioning sensors and actuators make further adjustments to the collective mid-point levels. The vice president for media relations has not arrived. The president is petulant. \"Where's MacDonald?\" she barks at Alvin, the holographic embodiment of DMC's embedded intelligence. The boardroom video screen switches from the agenda and shows MacDonald's office. He is heard and seen finishing off a telephone conversation with a journalist. He gets up from his desk and leaves his office. As he does so, another camera in the hallway shows him going down a corridor. His position co-ordinates, accurate to less than a metre, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the boardroom screen, change as MacDonald approaches the boardroom. He is seen putting his hand to the fingerprint reader, but the reader does not respond. He tries unsuccessfully to rub some ink from his finger, and then leans close to the iris scanner, which does respond, but he is still not admitted to the boardroom since he must have positive responses from both systems. The impatient president commands Alvin to open the door and finally McDonald is admitted. \"Okay, let's get on with it,\" says the president. \"Show me today's agenda,\" she instructs the computer. The agenda appears on a large wafer-thin video screen on the wall opposite the president. Three items are listed: Kevin Switzer, vice president for operations, speaks. \"We've had complaints from the Customs and Immigration folks about the shortage and reliability of our data on people coming into the States. 145 It mainly concerns people from developing countries. With our profiling technologies, we are able to identify anyone who might be a security risk or disposed to anti-social behaviour. Unfortunately, most developing countries have no AmI networks, which makes it impossible to build up the same kind of detailed profiles of individuals like we can here in the US, Europe or Japan. So the immigration authorities have been making threatening noises about refusing entry to people from countries without AmI networks.\" \"So what are you doing about it?\" asks the president. \"Well, I think we have a golden opportunity here. We can offer to set up AmI networks in those countries as long as we, I mean DMC, are the ones to collect and process the data. You'd think most countries would jump at the chance to have networks put in place at virtually no or little cost to them, but some of the countries are quibbling with us.\" 146 mount to signing their sovereignty over to us. But we've been working on a deal where we copy for them the data we collect\u2026 well, some of it, at least. Our intelligence agencies would not want us to hand over everything, and we don't have to either. We can offer the raw data to the developing countries, but certainly not the processed data. Developing countries will never know how we've processed the data, especially since we do the processing here in the United States or in the UK, i.e., outside their jurisdiction. They'll have to settle for what we give them.\" \"Okay, that sounds good to me. Any objections?\" she asks the others who remain silent. \"No? Okay, then, Jacques, it's your turn. What's the latest on the theft or whatever it was at our London office?\" But before Jacques Perrier, vice president for security, can respond, the company secretary leans over and whispers something to the president. \"Yes, you're right.\" The secretary stops the boardroom monitoring systems from recording more of the discussion on this subject.Perrier shifts uncomfortably in his chair. \"Well, as everyone here knows, we have a regular monthly audit of DMC's data processing activity. From the last audit two weeks ago, we discovered that there had been a second back-up of data immediately after the first. These back-ups are made every day. Sometimes there's a problem and a second back-up is made. It's not that unusual, but since it's not supposed to happen, we always check them out. The second back-up was anomalous too because it wasn't the whole of the database and didn't get backed up to the usual destination. In other words, we assume it was backed up locally \u2026\" Hausmann intervenes, \"By locally, you mean to another computer here in the building?\" \"Yes, except that none of the computers here show any evidence of having been the destination for the second back-up. That means some portable device with an optical connector was used.\" doing the regular back-ups that night. We wanted to ask them about this second back-up, but they had left on holidays a few hours after the second back-up was made. They were supposed to have returned from holidays three days ago, but they haven't reported for work and they haven't answered our calls.\" Surely you can track them via their location implants. Everybody has to have a location implant. It's a condition of employment in our company, just like any critical infrastructure like banks, nuclear power companies, etc.\" \"Yes, we've been checking their location data, but so far nothing,\" says Perrier. \"They could have been surgically removed,\" says Switzer. \"What about the data from the AmI systems? Have you checked the sensor networks in the homes and cars of those three employees?\" \"Yes,\" says Perrier. \"Like other employees, they've agreed that we can check their home systems and we've done that. There's obviously nobody in their apartments, and their cars have been stationary since they left on holidays \u2026\"",

But I think a lot of people simply do not realise how much personal information they are constantly giving out. 180 APPAG wants to raise public awareness about this issue and wants to warn people that personalised profiling is simply too risky. I joined APPAG after some bad experiences.\" \"What kind of bad experiences?\" \"First of all, during our last holiday, my wife and I discovered that we did not have access to the same information and services as other hotel guests. For example, there was a jazz concert in town during sunset but we did not get any information about it. We only found out the next day. I was really angry because my avatar knows I like such events. Also, the excursion to the old Roman ruins was already fully booked. We could only participate when paying a premium. This is so unfair. And do you know why? Just because the company that has the profiling exclusivity on our family recently merged with another company. Because we did not opt in to their new travelling module, they ignored the travelling preferences of my avatar. And then suddenly, you realise how dependent you have become on these things.\" \"But is that solved now?\" \"Yes, but \u2026 it set me thinking. What happens if you decide not to do it? I began to make a point of switching off my AmI sensors in public places so that my preferences could not be revealed and monitored. I'll leave them on in the home where I control the environment, or at work where there are confidentiality clauses protecting us but the moment I step outside I switch them off. A cumbersome procedure, a real hassle, but it can be done. The downside is that I now find myself missing out on announcements -including the emergencies -or special promotions that I would have liked to take advantage of. Recently, I was in the airport where I actually found that I was banned from the frequent flyers' lounge because their sensors objected to my sensors opting out! Even though I showed them my card, they still wouldn't let me in. Can you believe that? Why should I be denied entry? Now I can see that if I have my AmI sensors off at the airport, there's a distinct risk that I'll be stopped and searched and maybe miss my flight.\" \"But why would you want to switch \u2026?\" \"Because I value my privacy. I think a lot of people simply do not realise how much personal information they are constantly giving out. What I object to is the personal nature of this profiling. Personalised profiling leads to a lack of freedom in making a decision. Have you heard about the companies with plans to 'personalise' their self-service restaurants based on their customers' medical history? Imagine, you would like to have a steak but they give you a salad instead. \u2026 And what if insurance companies get involved and start raising your premiums because they found out that you are not doing a lot of physical exercise?",

Moreover, there will probably always be a record of this somewhere, even if it was cleared up the next day, and you never know if something similar might happen again. Not a very nice prospect.\" \"Tell us about what APPAG proposes?\" \"Well, one of the fundamental areas we want to work on is the legal framework. Though the data protection act covers personal data, we feel that there is a grey area about what really constitutes personal data and under what circumstances data collection is legal. I would argue that many of your preferences and lifestyle choices are, in fact, personal data. Furthermore, as I said earlier, we want to raise public awareness about these issues. Many people do not know what information is being collected and do not even know they have the right to opt out. This must change.\" Scene 2: AmI divides \"We now go live to New York where we are joined by Dr. Anthony Lazlo, a leading environmental scientist and pioneer of AmI for environmental protection who is very critical of current environmental protection programmes. Good morning, Anthony.\" \"Good morning, Alexandra, and thank you for the invitation to appear on your programme. I want to show you and your audience that our society is not making full use of the potential of environmental monitoring technologies but also that policy-makers need to understand that intelligent devices and intelligent agents alone are not going to solve the problem. The future simulations we will project are based on the widespread use of AmI sensors throughout Antarctica which have been collecting all sorts of information during the last 10 years.\" \"Can you tell us more in detail what you mean, Anthony?\" \"Of course, and I will show it to your audience. Have a look at these images live from Antarctica, which has one of the harshest climates on earth. Within the GCPthe Global Conservation Project -we have spread thousands of sensors in the environment to constantly monitor climate change. 181 That is because the costs of these tiny sensors -they are actually like smart dust 182 -have gone down drastically, although it is still very expensive to cover such a big landmass, especially under inhospitable conditions. But it is necessary, as rising sea levels have caused much destruction in the last few years. Look also at the projected graph with the information we receive on the water temperature, sea level, air pollution, etc. Similar smart monitoring projects in sensitive zones all over the world would help us a lot in combating environmental hazards and disasters, and could save many, many lives.\" \"So why are we not doing it then?\" \"Because there is not enough money for it. I mean, there is little commercial interest in this, so it needs to come from public funding, but political and governmental priorities are elsewhere. Now look at these images from a very different place, the hot and dry Saharan desert. These images came from a film shot by a camera crew that travelled recently to the region. Here, too, we can see environmental destruction. But here we do not have the technology to enable us to act quickly and remotely. But let me be clear about this. I'm not just talking about environmental issues. AmI technologies could have life-saving potential -if we were able to monitor the spread of certain viruses, for example, we could target immunisation programmes more effectively and stand a better chance of eradicating diseases. Medics working in the field here do not even have the latest 4G terminals with language translation and direct connection to medical laboratories.\" \"So you're saying more public money is needed?\" \"Yes, but not only that. We want to draw attention to the fact that although in some places we have been able to use this technology and harness its full capabilities, there are many other regions in the world that could greatly benefit but which do not have the funds to make the necessary investment. That is not fair. It should not be like that. \" \"Thanks, Anthony, for drawing our attention to this issue. Any last messages?\" \"Yes. It is not only about money nor only about technology. You can invest lots of money in technology implementations but if no political action is taken or if people and companies are not willing to change certain behaviours, then we are going the wrong way. All the money in the world would not be able to change that nor the most fantastic technologies.\" \"Unfortunately, we have to leave it there, Anthony. We now go to Iris for the most recent traffic information.\" Scene 3: Public life disrupted by virus attack \"The traffic situation downtown is currently heavy but stable. The communication backbone seems to be coping today with the heavy traffic of all the machine-tomachine messages that maintain increased traffic throughput. Pollution levels are steady, the emergency response rate is up by a point, crime-monitoring is at alert level yellow, and the accident rate is close to zero. A distinct improvement compared to the situation at the same time yesterday. But let's talk to Peter, our correspondent at the city traffic office, for the latest news on yesterday's chaos.\" \"Good morning, Peter. Tell us what happened yesterday. Was it a virus attack?\" \"Yes, it was. The city's intelligent traffic system went completely mad and the resulting traffic chaos was the worst we've seen in more than 15 years. Traffic lights kept on alternating every five seconds at random, for almost an hour. Cars were let into the city centre without being automatically charged the congestion toll thus contributing to the general chaos; road works were wrongly announced creating queues of angry drivers complaining to technical staff and buses did not stop at (digital) requests. According to a traffic official, the centre's main server was attacked by a digital virus. Initially, the self-repairing anti-virus software was able to counter the attack and in order to completely eradicate the hybrid virus (or multipartite virus), the software had to search for, identify and download software updates. Unfortunately, an unknown Trojan was able to briefly take control of the traffic management system. Emergency back-up systems were able to restore control after 45 minutes, but the impact on the city traffic lasted for many more hours.\" \"Peter, what did traffic administration say about it? It was obviously a serious security breach.\" \"Well, during the crisis, it seems their primary goal was to restore the situation back to normal as soon as possible. Once that was accomplished, they started asking questions about the attack. Who perpetrated it? What was their objective? Was it a diversion for other types of attacks, such as crime, robbery, etc.? They are seriously considering the possibility that this may have been a malicious terrorist attack 183 and are trying to find the missing links. Their specialists looked into the hybrid virus and the Trojan, and after analysis, they declared this morning that they were not dealing with a new-generation virus. The consequences would have been worse if this had been an attack using novel mutant type worms.\" \"Is there a longer term impact of the attack?\" \"Well, city officials aren't saying anything officially, but there's a rumour that the virus also caused partial loss of traffic data. That would mean that the traffic system has lost its intelligence and that it has to learn again to optimise traffic intervention measures. It could take up to two or three months, but again, this is an unconfirmed report. \"Officially, the city traffic experts say only the obvious, that security is critical in AmI environments like the traffic management system and that 'we' need to reduce the risks relating to the upgrading, maintenance and interoperability of such systems. Is that another way of saying they want more money? Who knows? Back to you, Iris. \" Next, our events correspondent, Didi, is at the scene of yesterday's rock concert, where security fears prompted the evacuation of almost 50,000 people. Fans are now demanding their money back as it emerges mishaps with the technology used by event organisers may have been to blame. Scene 4: AmI system aided mass risk management \"Here's Didi with our special report on the story.\" [Voiceover of report] \"Incidents in the past with big crowds led to the development of crowd management strategies supported by AmI technologies. 184 AmI has proved to be effective in facilitating intelligent communication among infrastructural elements (AmI sensors), event organisers, security managers and members of the crowd. Through the use of Edibles, Personal Wrist Communicators (PWC) and Disposable Wrist Communicators (DWC), crowds and individual movements are monitored continuously so that any incidents are noticed immediately. 185 This time, however, the system did not function properly. The concert hall was evacuated completely because panic arose for no reason at all.\"Last night, not everyone made the switch to 'Concert' mode. Early generation devices, very popular among the teenagers, were not sold with pre-prepared profiles and users of these devices had to create the profile manually; some did not do so. Other users simply did not download the concert profile as it was sucking up resources of their personal AmI devices. Thus, their AmI devices did not function properly. On the other hand, people with implants, through their intelligent proxies, were able to effortlessly negotiate, check and download the appropriate concert profiles. Also, people who had bought their tickets from ticket touts, habitually labelled 'clones', tried to mask their identity and assume the name corresponding to the ticket.",

            "text": "Temporary wireless pseudonymous authentication is possible thanks to new technology such as sensors and implants. In scene 4, implants were used for the crowd management application.Only the issue of medical implants has been addressed in the European Union. The Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active medical devices 199 was intended to harmonise the level of safety by mandatory specifications relating both to the technical safety features and the inspection procedures for a number of medical devices, including active implantable medical devices. The Directive sets out strict rules. In an AmI world, however, implants might be used for non-medical purposes.In scene 4, the concert organiser needs to ensure the safety and security of the people attending the concert. To this end, people carry chips that transmit an identity assigned to each person until the end of the concert. The chips enable concert-goers to remain anonymous and allow the concert organisers to check the behaviour of people at the concert. Thus, there is a balance between privacy and security, in keeping with Article 8 of the ECHR which protects the personal life of individuals. This protection implies the right to be anonymous. However, swallowing chips or using implants will not necessarily be regarded as a proportionate means to ensure safety. Less intrusive means (temporary chips in tickets or PDAs) could be envisaged, even if they might be less effective than intelligent implants 200 (as was the case in the scenario).Even when technology seems to offer intelligent solutions to safety vs. privacy problems, the traditional logic of human rights law has to be applied, i.e., the principle of proportionality and necessity. The Luxembourg Court of Justice of the European Union has held in the Adidas case 201 that \"It is apparent from both the abovementioned case-law and Directive 95/46 that protection for the sphere of private activity of natural and legal persons occupies an important place among the legal principles introduced by the Community legal order. However, that protection neither can nor should be absolute. The Court of Justice has held that restrictions may be imposed on fundamental rights provided that they in fact correspond to objectives of general public interest and do not constitute, with regard to the objectives pursued, a disproportionate and intolerable interference which infringes upon the very substance of the right protected.\"The same spirit has inspired the authors of the Data Protection Directive. They did not consider the right to protection of privacy as absolute, which would mean a general prohibition on selecting and processing personal data. Rather than laying down an absolute prohibition, the Directive indicates the need to ensure a balance 199 Council Directive 90/385/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active medical devices, Official Journal L 323, 26 November 1997, p. 39. 200 The scenario mentions the possibility of a lawsuit for damages caused by the improper functioning of the crowd management application.
