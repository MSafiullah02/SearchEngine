Inaccurate, rather than simply irresponsible, reporting of suicide is also noteworthy but less-studied by comparison. Previous studies tend to measure irresponsible reporting in terms of the amount of coverage, placement (in terms of front page and use of pictures), and whether or not the method and location are described in detail. In contrast, inaccurate reporting denotes presenting the information incorrectly or falsely, including overlooking or simplifying some details and engaging in problematic stereotyping.",

First of all, given the mass media's enormous penetration of daily life, the untruthful or problematic stereotyping found in the \u201cmass-mediated reality\u201d of suicide can lead to the creation of myths among the general public and make evidence-based prevention harder to promote (Fishman and Weimann, 1997, Hawton and Williams, 2002). In addition, such stereotyping may establish a linkage between certain life stressors and suicidal behaviors, which may influence vulnerable people to copy others' suicide through the social learning process (Fu et al., 2009). Last but not least, reporting accurately is the minimum acceptable standard of journalism, whereas reporting responsibly aspires to a rather higher level of performance. From a practical perspective, pushing the media to improve their practice beyond the minimum standard is likely to be easier than encouraging them to achieve even higher levels of performance.",

Taking Hong Kong (HK) as an example, previous studies show that newspapers have tended to underreport suicides among the elderly, preferring to focus on students (Au et al., 2004) or those aged 25 or below (Fu et al., 2011). However, no study has yet been conducted to compare the detailed profile of individual suicide cases with the content of how they have been reported in order to examine whether or not the news media has done so accurately and truthfully.",

The articles' reporting accuracy was examined by comparing the PA and news report for each individual case. The PA study included 150 individuals aged 15\u201359 who had committed suicide between August 2002 and December 2004. These cases were representative of all suicides in this age group in HK in 2003 in terms of the distribution of age, gender, and method (incorporating the three most common methods). The case\u2013control PA study obtained some of its factual information from the coroner's report and also included a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the psychological and contextual circumstances preceding the suicide. The PA methodology is generally accepted as valid and the data obtained from informants have been demonstrated to be reliable (Cavanagh et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2006). Certainly, some caution is warranted, since the methodology is still developing and has potential drawbacks. Recently some researchers have suggested that future PA studies should extend their interview content to areas such as the role of personality traits, illness, and the availability of lethal agents and also improve their interview procedures to minimize recall bias (Conner et al., 2011, Conner et al., 2012). Nevertheless, at the time of writing the PA study can be considered as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for comparison with media reports. In addition, the PA research method is similar to journalism in the sense that it involves interviewing informants who were familiar with the deceased. Therefore, a comparison between media reporting and the PA study using the same suicide cases can demonstrate the differences between the perspectives and perceptions of journalists and suicide prevention professionals.",

Among the HK media, the Apple Daily, Oriental Daily News, and Sun Daily are tabloid-style papers notorious for reporting suicides frequently and sensationally (Fu and Yip, 2008). A recent study even found that the entry of the Apple Daily into the Taiwanese market in 2003 had increased the reporting intensity of suicide news in traditional local newspapers (Chen et al., 2011).

Gender stereotyping is often found in the mass media and gender differences have been found in terms of suicidal behaviors and risk factors (Canetto, 2008, Kung et al., 2003). Charcoal burning is a relatively new method of suicide and has attracted huge media coverage in HK since the first case was reported in 1998. It has accounted for approximately 20% of annual suicides in HK since 2000 (Chan et al., 2009). People who commit suicide by charcoal burning, compared with people using other methods, are more likely to be economically active and physically healthy, and less likely to have a prediagnosed mental illness (Chan et al., 2005, Chan et al., 2009).",

These cover various readerships and are often selected by researchers doing media studies in HK (Au et al., 2004, Fu et al., 2011). As the PA study had recruited cases based on the coroner's report, the official coroner's record of the cases was also documented in the PA database, although the deceased's name was recoded as a number and his or her HK ID card number was removed. We first tracked each PA case back to its coroner's record and established a detailed profile for it. When linking the cases to news articles, we first searched on the deceased's name and the date of incidence as identified from the coroner's report. However, in some cases only the deceased's surname was reported in the papers. In this case, the date of occurrence, place, and/or suicide method were also used as search keywords. This process was repeated until we were certain that the case could be linked with specific news articles. The search time period was set as 0\u20135 days after each incidence to avoid missing any coverage, although the mass media tend to report these events in a timely fashion. The first author then double-checked all the articles to make sure the linkage is robust.",

The PA study had identified six general risk factors, namely being unemployed, having unmanageable debt, never having been married, lacking social support, being retrospectively diagnosed as having a psychiatric illness, and a history of past suicide attempts. Among these six factors, retrospective diagnosis with a psychiatric illness is a determination that can only be made by a qualified and registered psychiatrist, so it is unreasonable to expect a journalist to obtain this information. We therefore excluded this aspect from our review of the articles. Instead, an alternative criterion was included, that of having previously been treated for emotional problems. This is because, according to the guidelines for responsible reporting of suicides, the individual's personal mental-health history should be mentioned (Leung, 2004).",
