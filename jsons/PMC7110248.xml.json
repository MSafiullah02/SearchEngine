With the termination in 1969 of the longitudinal Junior Village study of infants and young children, which for 15 years had encompassed each of these goals, the emphasis of the Epidemiology Section of the LID turned to the study of the etiology of acute nonbacterial (viral) gastroenteritis. The Junior Village study generated seminal information on the epidemiology of respiratory and enteric infections and led to the discovery of many respiratory and enteric viruses [1]. Although nonbacterial diarrheal illnesses had occurred frequently in this study and many enteric viruses were readily recovered in tissue culture, none emerged as etiologic agents of diarrhea. The search for a viral etiologic agent for acute gastroenteritis began in the late 1960s and was intensified in the early 1970s. The search for a viral agent was based on the rationale that (1) the etiology of most episodes of infectious gastroenteritis among pediatric and adult populations was unknown [2, 3]; (2) it was assumed that viruses were important in these outbreaks because bacteria were associated etiologically only infrequently [2, 3]; (3) bacteria-free stool filtrates induced gastroenteritis in adult volunteer studies [4\u201312]; and (4) new techniques, such as organ culture, that might enable the cultivation of a fastidious etiologic agent had become available.",

These included the use of human embryonic nasal or tracheal organ culture, which preserved cells in their normal state of differentiation and architecture. Organ culture was used successfully for the discovery of several new respiratory coronaviruses that did not grow in conventional tissue cultures [13, 14]. The success in growing fastidious coronaviruses in organ culture stimulated renewed efforts to cultivate the elusive agents of \u201cviral\u201d gastroenteritis; human fetal intestinal organ cultures were established in an effort to find a method to support the growth of a heretofore noncultivatable gastroenteritis virus [15, 16]. However, the organ culture technique (as well as standard tissue-culture techniques) also failed to yield an etiologic agent [17]. Although the study specimens that were tested were derived from individuals with nonbacterial gastroenteritis, there was no practical way of knowing whether they contained infectious material that was capable of producing disease. It was possible that the inability to detect a virus resulted from the absence of an infectious agent in the test specimen. Fecal specimens of known infectivity from early volunteer studies described above could not be accessed because they were either not available at the time or had been exhausted.",

In 1970, fecal filtrates from four separate gastroenteritis outbreaks were studied in groups of 3\u20134 volunteers [18]. One of the four outbreaks took place in an elementary school in Norwalk, Ohio, in October 1968, and was investigated by the Centers for Disease Control [20]. During a 2-day period, 50% of the students and teachers (116/232) developed a gastrointestinal illness, and there was a secondary attack rate of 32% among contacts of primary cases. The incubation period was \u223c48 h, and the illness, which lasted \u223c24 h, was described as \u201cwinter vomiting disease\u201d because it was reminiscent of the syndrome first described by Zahorsky in 1929 [21]. Indeed, the prominent clinical manifestations in the Norwalk outbreak were vomiting and nausea, although some of the patients developed diarrhea. Laboratory studies did not reveal an etiologic agent.",

This technique, a method defined as the direct observation of antigen-antibody interaction [23], was not new\u2014it had been described in 1941 in studies with tobacco mosaic virus [24, 25]. Even with the development of electron microscopes with increased resolving power and the introduction of negative-staining techniques, which greatly enhanced contrast, thus facilitating the recognition of viruses [26], the application of IEM was underutilized. We examined human coronaviruses by IEM to visualize the formation of complement holes in the envelope following incubation with uninactivated serum, as previously described for an avian coronavirus [23]. We also examined rhinovirus preparations by IEM in an attempt to visualize these 27-nm viruses clearly because they did not grow to high titer, were of rather small size (even for a virus), and did not have a distinctive morphologic appearance [27].",

The mixture was then centrifuged, and the pellet was reconstituted with distilled water and stained with phosphotungstic acid [27]. Examination of the control preparation revealed scattered, randomly distributed, 27-nm particles, some of which could not be identified conclusively as a virus (figure 1). However, in the virus-serum preparation, the 27-nm rhinovirus particles were no longer randomly distributed but appeared in the form of large and small aggregates coated with antibody and standing out clearly from the background, leaving no doubt that they were virus particles (figure 2). These observations had a major impact on the course of my future research as I realized that IEM might enable the detection of fastidious viruses that do not grow in tissue culture. Key to this concept was the realization that although hyperimmune serum would not be available for enabling the detection of a noncultivatable unknown agent, convalescent sera could be used for screening as it would provide the specificity needed to detect a putative viral agent.",

In June 1972, almost 20 months after beginning such studies, I examined a Norwalk agent stool filtrate (designated 8FIIa) derived from a volunteer who became ill after oral administration of the Norwalk agent [31]. This filtrate was known to contain an infectious agent because it had induced a diarrheal illness in 6 of 10 volunteers. Following incubation of the stool filtrate with a volunteer's convalescent serum and further preparation for electron microscopy, glistening aggregates of nonenveloped, antibody-coated 27-nm, virus-like particles, which resembled rhinoviruses, were visualized. A characteristic aggregate observed in early experiments is shown in figure 3A. The visualization of virus-like particles was very promising, but it was clear that further studies were needed to determine the significance of this finding.

How could this be done with a particle that could not be cultivated? An antibody-rating system was developed, in which a low dilution of pre- or postchallenge serum (1 : 5) was reacted with the Norwalk agent (8FIIa) stool filtrate for examination by IEM: The amount of antibody coating the particles was rated on a 0\u20134+ scale, with 4+ being a very heavy coating of antibody, which almost obscured the particle, and 3+, 2+, or 1+ indicating lesser amounts of antibody. A 1+ difference in antibody rating was a significant seroresponse. An example of a 1+ rating is shown in figure 3A and a 4+ rating in figure 3B. Crucial to this rating system was the requirement that the ratings be made under code to assure objectivity. An example of a significant seroresponse using a volunteer's pre- or post-challenge serum from a later study with the Norwalk virus is shown in figure 4.",

Four of the paired sera were obtained from primary cases, 1 from a secondary case (\u201cJ\u201d) and 1 from a contact who did not become ill (table 1). This was a crucial experiment because it would be highly unlikely that the newly discovered 27-nm particle was an adventitious agent if the naturally occurring cases developed an antibody response to it. We found that 3 of the 5 individuals who had become ill developed a significant antibody response to the 27-nm Norwalk particle. The 2 who did not develop such a response had a high level of antibody to the 27-nm particle in both acute and convalescent sera, most likely a reflection of the time of acquisition of the acute phase sera, probably several days after the onset of disease. In addition, the contact who did not become ill did not develop a seroresponse. The demonstration of an antibody response in 3 of 5 individuals who developed illness under natural conditions, independently of the responses observed in the challenged volunteers, was a major link in establishing the chain of causation. One of the 3 (\u201cJ\u201d) who developed a seroresponse was the donor of the original rectal swab specimen from which the 27-nm particle was derived.

We tested sequential sera from 2 volunteers who underwent three successive challenges.
