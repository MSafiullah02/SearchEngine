Influenza viruses possess a segmented negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome and belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza virus infection causes acute respiratory inflammation in humans with symptoms such as high fever, body aches, fatigue, and can result in death. Up to one-half million deaths occur annually, with close to five million reported cases.45 The best defense thus far is the yearly strain-specific vaccine. The efficacy of this vaccine is low due to several factors, including continual antigenic drift (minor mutational changes that occur over time) and annual vaccine mismatches to circulating strains.45 The low efficacy of the vaccine coupled with the ease of transmission and severity of disease among the very young, very old, and other immunocompromised individuals has made alternative therapies attractive.46\n",

All five of these groups differed significantly in their relative abundance of 15 different bacterial genera.2 When looking at the implications of certain taxa within the NOP CSTs on susceptibility to influenza, results showed a negative association between Bacteroidetes and NOP CST 4, of which the highest relative abundance was both Streptococcus and Neisseria, on host susceptibility to influenza infection. A positive correlation was noted between Alloprevotella and Prevotella and infection susceptibility.43\n",

In inulin-treated mice, the microbiome structure was significantly improved, and beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including Bifidobacteriaceae, became dominant. Inulin or SCFAs intake prevented excessive neutrophil influx into the airways by blunting the levels of CXCL1 produced by lung monocytes and macrophages. In addition, inulin and SCFAs increased antiviral immunity through CD8+ T cell activation.10 Another study in a mouse model of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) reported similar findings that fermentable dietary fiber can reduce virus replication, protect the lungs against inflammation and pathological changes induced by RSV infection through microbiota-derived acetate in mice.51 Since fermentable dietary fiber play a role in regulating immunity by promoting the growth of SCFA-producing bacteria, taking fermentable dietary fiber and reducing the excessive immune response and lung pathology caused by the viruses are a causal relationship, not just a correlation. To date, there are no human clinical studies on using fermentable dietary fiber to prevent influenza or other respiratory viral infection or to reduce the disease severity. This area of translational research warrants further investigation.",

Several anaerobic bacteria also were implicated in the increased susceptibility to HIV infection in this study, including Prevotella and Sneathia.\n13 These bacteria were shown to increase inflammation in the genital tract, further decreasing the participants' immune robustness against HIV infection.13\n",

Secretor status of an individual is determined by the functionality of the FUT2 gene, which is responsible for producing an enzyme critical to generating glycans present in saliva and mucus.69 These glycans can serve as an infection initiating binding site of certain HuNoV strains.69 When both alleles of this gene are altered and nonfunctional, a person is deemed a non-secretor.69 Non-secretors have been shown to be highly resistant to symptomatic HuNoV infections due to the mutation in the FUT2 gene, which diminishes the norovirus's ability to bind to receptors in the intestine, thus preventing HuNoV from entering cells and causing infection.69 Several studies also have shown secretor status to be linked to microbiota composition.15, 70\n",

Sixteen of the more than 5000 groups were found to have significant differences, and consisted of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, found in non-secretors. There were also significant differences in richness of the sampled microbiota, though they were not significant in regards to secretors versus non-secretors.15 Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were the most abundant phyla categorized from both secretors and non-secretors. This study also found anti-HuNoV IgA levels were significantly correlated with secretor versus non-secretor status, with secretors maintaining higher levels of the two groups.15 The viral infectivity and host susceptibility to HuNoV was negatively correlated to the level of Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium present in host samples. When these insights are combined with the negative correlation between anti-norovirus IgA titers and susceptibility to HuNoV infection, the notion that host microbiome, secretor status and susceptibility are all reliant on each other to some extent is apparent.15 More thorough research is needed to evaluate other factors that simultaneously play a role in microbiome composition of all secretors and non-secretors and how this influences host immunity.15 This is especially important for the determination of the best strategies to protect those in low-income areas in which HuNoV is of greatest public health concern, and the microbiome is likely an effective target for future personalized therapies.63\n",

Gn animals have played a critical role in the understanding of interactions among microbiota, viral pathogen or vaccine antigen, and the host.71 The neonatal Gn pig model is well suited for the study of HuNoV and microbiome interaction because Gn pig model of HuNoV infection reflects HuNoV biology in terms of supporting the natural oral route of infection and results in diarrhea, transient viremia, and fecal virus shedding.72, 73 Recently, we established a human gut microbiota (HGM) transplanted Gn pig model of HuNoV infection and disease, using a well-characterized stool sample from a healthy infant as HGM transplant and a HuNoV GII.4/2006b strain for virus inoculation.16 Compared to germ-free Gn pigs, HuNoV inoculation in HGM transplanted Gn pigs resulted in increased HuNoV infection, characterized by significantly higher shedding titers and significantly longer mean duration of virus shedding. HuNoV infection also dramatically altered intestinal microbiota at the phylum and genus levels in HGM transplanted Gn pigs. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria (95.6% versus 56.5%) and Firmicutes (3.6% versus 0.5%) significantly decreased, while Bacteroidetes (0.1% versus 42.9%) significantly increased; at the genus level, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, and Anaerococcus significantly decreased, while Bacteroides and Lactobacillus significantly increased in HGM transplanted pigs infected with HuNoV compared to HGM transplanted pigs without HuNoV infection. In summary, enhanced GII.4 HuNoV infection was observed in the presence of HGM, and significant intestinal microbiota alterations were observed under HuNoV infection in HGM transplanted Gn pigs.16 The mechanisms underlying the enhancing effect of HGM on HuNoV infection are probed using transcriptome analysis of the ileum tissues of the Gn pigs. One of the most important impact of HGM is the down regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03bb gene IFN-1L expression. IFN-\u03bb is known to play a critical role in the host defense against enteric viruses, including rotavirus, reovirus74 and norovirus.75\n",

HRV is the leading cause of severe, dehydrating diarrhea among children under 5 years of age worldwide.76 Annual mortality rates due to RV infections have declined from ~ 528,000 in 2000 to ~ 215,000 in 201376 owing to the implementation of HRV vaccines RotaTeq\u00ae and Rotarix\u00ae in the national immunization program in many countries. These two vaccine vaccines are highly efficacious (80\u201390%) in high income countries, but the efficacies are significantly reduced (40\u201360%) in low-income countries. Studies indicated that several factors, including microbiota dysbiosis,77 concurrent uses of poliovirus oral vaccines,78, 79 enterovirus infections,80 and malnutrition81 contributed to the observed impaired efficacy of the oral RV vaccines,79 likely by changing intestinal environments and homeostasis.82, 83 Harris et al.17 analyzed the serum IgA antibody responses to Rotarix\u00ae in 78 Ghanaian infants and their fecal microbiome. Comparing between the 39 responder and non-responder pairs and to the Dutch infants, the overall microbiome composition was significantly different, with the responders more similar to healthy Dutch infants than non-responders. Responses to Rotarix\u00ae correlated with an increased abundance of Streptococcus bovis and the lack of response is correlated with the high abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum, especially several bacteria related to species from the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera.17 Another study was reported for Pakistani infants.18 IgA antibody responses to Rotarix\u00ae correlated with higher abundance of bacteria belonging to Clostridium cluster XI and Proteobacteria, including bacteria related to Serratia and Escherichia coli. Abundance of these Proteobacteria was also significantly higher in Dutch infants when compared to non-responders in Pakistan. These clinical studies showed that the intestinal microbiota composition correlated with seroconversion rate in infants after vaccination and identified microbiome signatures of vaccine responder versus non-responder infants. Identification of key bacterial phylotypes that correlate with vaccine-induced responses could be used as indicator to predict which infants are at risk for vaccine failure and to design an intervention through modulating gut microbiota to improve rotavirus vaccine efficacy.18, 77 A study of microbiome diversity in RataTeq vaccinated versus unvaccinated children in Spain did not find any differences.84\n",

Newborn Gn pigs were transplanted with the HHGM or UHGM, followed by oral vaccination with the live attenuated Wa HRV and challenged with virulent HRV. Prior to HRV challenge, HHGM in Gn pigs was predominantly composed of bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, whereas UHGM was composed of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. When challenged, the severity of illness among vaccinated HHGM pigs was much lower compared to vaccinated UHGM pigs. Analysis of fecal microbiome post-challenge showed a significant increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes in HHGM transplanted Gn pigs and a significant decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia abundance. Stronger vaccine-induced immune responses (HRV-specific IgG, IgA and VN antibodies; and CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + and CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cells) were facilitated by HHGM, hence conferring a stronger protection against HRV disease among vaccinated HHGM pigs than UHGM pigs.19 Similar results were also observed in Gn pigs colonized with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, commensal bacteria commonly found as part of the microbiota of breast-fed infants.20 Findings in Gn pigs are highly translatable to humans and as suggested by Dr. Harris \u201cCorrelate microbiome composition with vaccine effectiveness in appropriate experimental platforms will lead to the identification of safe, vaccine-supporting microbiota targets that are relevant to populations in need of improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.\u201d18\n",

Poultry eggs and meat are crucial components to maintaining food security all over the globe. Fast-growing domestic poultry species are exposed to many environmental factors that can affect their health, performance, and productivity. To protect poultry from factors that may render them vulnerable to disease, scientists continuously investigate internal and external factors that may affect their health and productivity. The gastrointestinal tract has been a central part of these investigations as the gut health, function, and integrity are essential for overall wellbeing of birds. The gut microbiota, which contains tremendous numbers of bacterial species, has recently been extensively characterized in some avian species including chickens, turkeys, and ducks.95, 96, 97 The influence of viral infections on the gut health and the homeostasis of commensal microbial populations of affected birds have been also investigated. Viral infections are also known risk factors for coinfection by other secondary, opportunistic pathogens as they cause damage to local and systemic immune defenses.98 Here, we review the interplay between a number of viral pathogens and the gut microbiota of their respective natural avian hosts.",

In a study by Li et al.25 at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was increased\u2014as observed in the study above\u2014while that of Firmicutes was decreased in H9N2 virus-infected young chickens. The relative abundance of endogenous bacterial genera within the family Enterobacteriaceae was increased; these genera included Escherichia\u2014especially E. coli which colonized the ileum\u2014, Clostridium, and Veillonella. On the other hand, a severe reduction in the probiotic organisms including the lactic acid-producing bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus), Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and SMB53 was observed.25 These findings clearly indicate that an influenza virus infection can disrupt the commensal microbial population in affected chickens.",

The composition and diversity of cloacal microbiome and their relationship with the active status of IAV infection and affected host have been studied in five waterfowl species: A. acuta (northern pintail), A. americana (American wigeon), A. carolinensis (green-winged teal), A. clypeata (northern shoveler), and A. platyrhynchos (mallard).101 Six bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes (ordered based on proportions of abundance) were consistently represented in IAV-negative, i.e., healthy, ducks of the above-mentioned five species. These phyla composed an average of 97.1% of the ducks' microbiota and thus were further investigated in the study. The relative abundance of bacterial phyla was drastically different within the various host species, with no unique patterns across species. However, green-winged teals and mallards showed the same pattern of abundance for all phyla, while northern shovelers showed the opposite pattern. The relationship among the various groups of bacterial taxa was evaluated using a microbiome diversity measurement, bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) co-occurrence patterns. The observed OTUs in IAV-positive and -negative birds showed no consistent patterns among host species. Moreover, the number of observed OTUs by IAV infection status was only significant in two out of five duck species.101 Findings from this study indicates that host genetics (and possibly other environmental factors, e.g., feed and habitat) may play a crucial role in the response of waterfowl to influenza virus infections. Another study on juvenile wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) only analyzed the differences in the cloacal microbiome of IAV-infected birds as compared to healthy ones.26 Overall, the cloacal microbiome in healthy mallards was more rich, diverse, robust, and uniform than that in IAV-infected birds. Among 41 identified OTUs, IAV-infected mallards were found to have \u2264 12 versus 24 in healthy birds. Thus, IAV-negative mallards were richer in OTUs and had greater OTU diversity and evenness than those of IAV-positive group. The same six bacterial phyla listed above were also represented in both IAV-positive and -negative birds at similar levels of relative abundance. The higher differences were observed within the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Members of the genus Streptococcus and species Veillonella dispar and Rothia mucilaginosa were major contributors to these differences.26\n",

In uninfected chicks, the duodenum had a richer (indicated by higher OTU counts and abundance indices) and more diverse microbiota than the cecum. In normal duodenum, the predominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, with six more less-dominant phyla. At the genus level, bacteria from Serratia, Escherichia, Chitinophagaceae unclassified, Saprospiraceae unclassified, and Lactobacillus were represented the most in the normal duodenum among other genera. In the cecum of uninfected chicks, the prevailing bacterial phyla were only Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with five more marginally-represented phyla detected. At the genus level, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Erwinia, Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Serratia constituted the great majority of the normal cecal microbiota.27 Comparing NDV-infected with uninfected chicks, the richness and diversity of duodenal microbiota were lower in the former. The cecal microbiota was almost unaffected by the NDV infection. As for the microbial composition, both duodenal and cecal bacterial communities were adversely affected in a similar manner. An increase in Sinobacteraceae and Rhodoplanes family members was observed. Also, at the genus level, a massive loss was observed in members of the following families in both duodenum and cecum of NDV-infected chicks: Xanthomonadaceae, SC-I-84, Cytophagaceae, Bacteroidales, Chitinophagaceae, Gemm-1, Saprospiraceae, Ignavibacteriaceae, Rhizobiales, Sphingobacteriales, Ellin6067, Acidimicrobiales, and Pseudomonas. Moreover, a dramatic reduction was found in the abundance of Xanthomonadaceae and Cytophagaceae family members.27 A significant reduction in the relative abundance of Serratia and Clostridium genera residing in the duodenum was recorded as opposed to greatly increased numbers in the ceca. This implied a possible translocation of these genera from duodenum to cecum of NDV-infected chicks. Moreover, authors proposed a translocation of several bacterial genera from the cecum to the duodenum of infected birds according to changes in their relative abundance.27\n",

Similar results were later revealed by Bautista-Garfias et al.,109 who studied the effect of oral administration of L. casei (ATCC7469 strain) on the humeral immune response to NDV vaccination and production performance in fighting roosters. Blood anti-NDV antibody levels in L. casei-treated group were comparable to those of the vaccine control birds. On the other hand, the natural mortality rate and body weight gain were significantly improved in the probiotic-treated group, compared with the untreated one.109 The use of two (cecal and jejunal) bacterial isolates of L. reuteri PIA16 strain in feed, either alone or with a prebiotic (mannan oligosaccharide), demonstrated substantially enhanced humoral immune response to NDV vaccine in broiler chickens. The cell-mediated immune response; however, remained largely unaffected throughout the course of the experimental period.28 Results from the probiotics studies indicate that these beneficial bacteria can boost the performance and overall health status in poultry. Although these studies showed generic positive impact on NDV-vaccinated chickens, the associated changes in the intestinal microbiota have not been examined. Moreover, whether the supplementation of these probiotics/prebiotics has an enhanced protective effect for NDV vaccines against the consequences of an NDV challenge is yet to be investigated.",

            "text": "The role of IBDV in modulating the commensal microbiota in chickens has recently been studied.29 Young chickens were infected with IBDV and the changes in the cecal bacterial communities were analyzed in comparison with uninfected, healthy birds. Regardless of the infection status, nine bacterial phyla were represented in the chicken cecal microbiota, with Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes members forming more than 95% of total bacterial population in the cecum. At the family level, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae composed the majority of cecal microbiota, with the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae decreasing over time and that of Ruminococcaceae increasing over time for up to 7 weeks of age. At the genus level, an increase in the abundance of Faecalibacterium was observed till ~ 4 weeks of age, and decreased thereafter. IBDV infection of young chickens caused immediate and obvious alteration in the composition of cecal microbiota. Changes were continuously seen over a three-week observation period postinfection,29 though no certain pattern was observed. At the genus level, in comparison to uninfected group, IBDV-infected chickens had a lower abundance in the commensal Clostridium XlVa at day 3 postinfection, which became higher thereafter. On the other hand, after 7 days of IBDV infection chickens had a higher abundance of Faecalibacterium (Gram-positive bacteria) than uninfected ones, which became lower thereafter. A reduction in the abundance of Escherichia/Shigella (Proteobacteria) was observed in chickens until 3 weeks postinfection, which contributed to the overall decrease recorded for family Enterobacteriaceae.\n29 These changes in the cecal microbiota were associated with IBDV-induced immunosuppression, the manifestations of which is described below. Another study showed that the infection of young chickens with IBDV or Campylobacter jejuni, either alone or combined, provoked significant modifications in the composition of gut microbiota, as compared with uninfected chickens.30 Changes in the abundance of OTUs from the following bacterial genera were observed in the cecal contents of infected chickens: Campylobacter, Clostridium XIVa, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia. The abundance of Campylobacter was increased in IBDV/C. jejuni-infected chickens and it was higher in birds inoculated with bacteria at 7 days versus 9 days postinfection. Obviously, the exposure time to a secondary pathogen following an immunosuppressive viral infection has a significant impact on its pathogenicity, colonization, and persistence, as is the case here with IBDV and C. jejuni. Similar observations have been reported for hemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys\u2014a siadenovirus-based immunosuppressive disease\u2014and secondary E. coli infections.113\n",

However, unlike C. jejuni, Salmonella clearance appeared not to be related to the antibody response. Numbers of localized T lymphocytes and cell-mediated immune responses did not seem to be affected by IBDV infections.27, 32\n",

Analysis of OTUs detected in the gut of healthy turkeys revealed the presence of four abundant phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In healthy turkeys, Firmicutes was the predominant phylum (80\u2013100%) in the three small intestinal sections, while in the cecum a more heterogeneous population containing representatives from Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria was observed.33 The diversity of cecal microbial population was also observed throughout the developmental stages of turkeys up to 16 weeks of age. The bacterial populations were also dissected at the genus level in the different gastrointestinal tract sections and Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium XI were the prevailing genera forming nearly 80% of the total microbiota. An interesting finding was that Campylobacter spp. was most abundant in the cecum of turkey poults at 10 weeks of age.96 Interestingly, similar to turkeys, both chickens and ducks have a greater microbial diversity in the cecum as compared to the rest of the small intestine.96, 119, 120 The abundance of jejunal bacterial populations at the family level was altered by natural infections of HEV in turkeys. Compared to uninfected turkeys, infected birds with clinical signs and HEV detected in the intestines\u2014indicating an early-phase infection\u2014had a lower abundance in Micrococcaceae and a higher abundance of Propionibacteriaceae, while those turkeys with no clinical signs and virus detected in the spleen\u2014indicating a late-phase infection\u2014had a much lower abundance in both families. The abundance of family Bacteroidaceae was extremely increased in HEV-infected turkeys as compared to uninfected controls. For the phyla Firmicutes, a substantial reduction in Lactobacillaceae and an increase in Clostridiaceae was observed in intestinally-positive turkeys with clinical signs. An opposite trend was recorded for turkeys with positive spleens and no clinical signs. However, both groups of infected turkeys showed an increased abundance of three other families belonging to Firmicutes. Family Campylobacteriaceae increased in abundance by 18- to 26-folds in HEV-infected turkeys.33 HEV infection of turkeys has been associated with secondary E. coli infections during the transient immunosuppression period.34 HEV is transmitted through fecal-oral route and eventually reaches the blood stream. In the spleen, the virus replicates rapidly in B lymphocytes and to a much lower extent in macrophages. Hyperplasia of the splenic white pulp occurs as a result of infiltration with high numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes, including CD4 + T cells. The interplay among these various types of immune cells within the site of viral replication leads to the production of very high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines of type I and II IFNs. The latter activates macrophages, inducing the production of the antiviral and immunosuppressive nitric oxide (NO). Most likely, IFN-I and NO play a role in clearing the virus later from the spleen.121, 122, 123 Moreover, it was suggested that the intestinal hemorrhage in the jejunum area occurs through inflammation-induced \u201cdiapedesis.\u201d124 This might be associated with a compromised intestinal epithelial cell barrier of the gut as noticed with other enteric viral infections.",

Specific pathogen-free chickens were placed for a few days with age-matched peers in commercial and back yard farms with previous history of enteric and respiratory problems. Intestinal samples were then collected and the enteric virome and microbiome were analyzed.125 The analysis revealed that the new viruses which colonized the gut of SPF birds belong to the families Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae. This implies that members of these families are associated with enteric diseases in chickens. In these birds, alterations of the gut microbiome were also observed, specifically in the Lachnospiracea family and the Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera. Other virus families that were represented in the enteric virome of chickens included Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Leviviridae, Siphoviridae, and Retroviridae.125 In another study, the fecal virome in healthy commercial chickens was analyzed by viral nucleic acid purification, illumina sequencing, and de novo assembly.126 Analysis of the assembled viral genome sequences indicated the presence of viruses belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae.126 Additionally, novel, unclassified, viruses with circular single-stranded DNA genomes were identified. The fecal virome of wild waterfowls has been also recently analyzed in various species of migratory wild ducks.127 The DNA and RNA viral genomes were isolated from purified viral particles, their nucleotide sequences obtained, and analyzed. The most abundant viral familied recognized in the duck's virome were Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae, and Myoviridae.127 In a more recent study on healthy waterfowl and shorebirds, the presence of 27 viral species was reported. These species represent the families Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, and Parvoviridae. Variations in virus abundance and diversity were detected among the various species studied.128 The results signify the potential of wild birds as reservoir of disease-causing poultry pathogens.",

The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased in healthy calves, while Proteobacteria was abundant in rotavirus diarrhea samples.43 This was consistent with human rotavirus diarrhea cases that the phylum Proteobacteria is associated with gut dysbiosis and inflammation.41 At the genus level, in rotavirus-infected calves, there was significant increase of the genera Escherichia, Clostridium, and Streptococcus. However, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Coprococcus were decreased. Notably, Lactobacillus was significantly decreased in the rotavirus diarrhea calves. At the species level, Lactobacillus species such as L. gasseri and L. amylovorus were found to be relatively abundant in healthy calves. L. gasseri is known to prevent the severity of acute self-limiting diarrhea in adults.42 In rotavirus-infected calves, the relative abundance of G. formicillis, B. glucerasea, B. coccoides, and B. obeum were significantly higher in the healthy group. Two species of C. perfringens and E. coli associated with the diarrheic calves were identified.43 This study demonstrated that rotavirus infection changed the structure of the gut microbiota, which would affect the follow up diagnosis and administration.",

Meanwhile, the virus propagation ability of BLV strains was negatively correlated with one taxon of Sanguibacteroides. Besides causing lymphoproliferation and leukemia, BLV infection may decrease energy production efficiency in the infected cows through modification of rumen and hindgut microbiota.44 According to function speculation of the bacteria detected in the differential abundance analysis, energy production loss in the rumen and hindgut was assumed, which may explain the secondary negative effects such as increased susceptibility to other infections and decreased lifetime milk production and reproductive efficiency.170, 171, 172, 173 Further studies need to systematically investigated rumen microbiota with rumen nutrition status, such as the level of volatile fatty acids together with BLV strain genetics.",

Meanwhile, the immunosuppression caused by BLV infection may decrease energy production efficiency in the cows through modification of rumen and hindgut microbiota. The mechanisms of interactions between microbiota and viruses in ruminant host in regard to pathological progress in viral diseases should be better explored in future research.",

The studies reviewed in this chapter have shown such significant implications of the microbiota on host immunity. The influence of the microbiota on viral infection susceptibility and viral disease outcome is undisputable although varies among viruses. These data are very important in terms of viral infection, as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available. Further understanding of the interactions between viral pathogens, host species and their microbiota will eventually allow us to tailor the contents of the microorganisms to the extent that it is able to protect the host from certain life-threatening viral infections. More research is needed to establish concrete cause and effect relationships between the microbiota composition and viral infection, as many of these studies did not address other factors that also are known to influence microbiota composition, such as genetics, diet, and environment. It should also be noted that some of these studies focused on small cohorts of participants, and more work is needed to establish trends among larger populations. Despite the limitations of some of the presented works, the microbiota still prevails as a hopeful means of immunotherapy for prevention of viral infection in the future in both humans and farm animals.",
