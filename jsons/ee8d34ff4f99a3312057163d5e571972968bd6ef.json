Regions of this nature appear in the DNA that encodes ribosomal RNA and in housekeeping genes that encode essential proteins. Following PCR amplification, a fully automated ESI-MS analysis is performed. The mass spectrometer effectively weighs the PCR amplicons, or mixture of amplicons, with sufficient mass accuracy that the composition of A, G, C, and T can be deduced for each amplicon present. The base compositions are compared to a database of calculated base compositions derived from the sequences of known organisms to determine the identities of the microorganisms present. In the event that there is no match of the measured base composition with a sequence in the database, the nearest neighbor organism is identified. Thus, analysis by the PCR/ESI-MS method provides information that enables identification of a broad range of microbes in a sample without having to anticipate what microbes might be present. The identities of microbes in a mixed population are determined because the primers amplify the nucleic acids from all organisms in the sample simultaneously, and the mass spectrometer analyzes and reports on multiple peaks in the same spectrum.",

The upper portion of the hourglass depicts identification of microbes, generally bacteria and viruses, present in an unknown sample at the species level as described. The utility of PCR/ESI-MS has been demonstrated for broad bacterial surveillance (2) and for identification of virus families, including coronaviruses (4) , influenza viruses (5) , adenoviruses (6) , alphaviruses (7) , and orthopoxviruses (3) . The bottom portion of the hourglass in Fig. 1 refers to assays developed on the PCR/ESI-MS platform that are specific for a particular species; these assays reveal molecular details such as the presence of virulence factors, antibiotic or antiviral drug resistance, or high-resolution molecular signatures that distinguish closely related subspecies. These high-resolution molecular analyses require separate assays that investigate important questions unique to a particular microbe. For example, for Staphylococcus aureus , it is important to determine the presence 2. High-Resolution Molecular Genotyping by Multilocus PCR and Mass Spectrometry or absence of certain virulence factors, mobile genetic elements, or mutations in housekeeping genes that mediate drug resistance.

In this method, the data are digital and portable, facilitating comparison among laboratories worldwide. However, conventional MLST requires isolation of pure colonies of the target microbe followed by multiple PCR reactions and sequencing of each amplicon. While sequencing technology has become much more facile in recent years, it is still not practical to use conventional MLST in a clinical laboratory setting. Clinical and public health laboratories require simple, automated analytical methods that match their throughput needs and cost limitations. In contrast to conventional MLST, multilocus PCR/ ESI-MS provides an automated, high-throughput alternative that approaches the resolution of sequence-based, conventional MLST and can be implemented in a clinical laboratory at very low per-sample costs.",

The same set of housekeeping genes used for conventional MLST are analyzed to identify the regions that contain the highest information content in their base compositions, and sets of primer pairs are designed to these regions. Typically, 100-150 nucleotide regions are selected for amplification. The information values of the amplicons are evaluated until an optimal set of primer pairs is identified. Each primer pair is assigned to a position in a 96-well plate such that a sample is amplified by eight pairs of primers and analyzed by MS. Each of the primer pairs produces an amplicon that results in a spectral signal and base composition, or four-position A, G, C, T signature (but since here amplicons are generally of constant length, each base composition signature actually contains only three independent variables). Base compositions from each of the eight primer sets result in a 24-dimensional digital signature that can be compared to calculated base composition signatures generated from an MLST database. The ability to distinguish MLST alleles by PCR followed by MS is, at first glance, counterintuitively high. Molecular biologists generally think in terms of the sequence of the nucleotides as the signature of a microbe. But, while the potential number of distinct sequences within any given MLST locus is astronomical (4 x , where x is the number of nucleotides showing mutations), the number of actual, biologically relevant sequences is typically much more manageable: First, only a fraction (10-20%) of the positions within MLST loci show variation. Second, most of these sites do not display the full range of possible mutations, but merely transitions. Third, only a fraction of these sites is simultaneously mutated. Thus, only 50 to 100 alleles, differentiated by specific sets of mutations, are typically reported in MLST databases for a single locus.",

            "text": ", and all result in masses that are unique ( see Fig. 3 ). As additional mutations occur, the resulting space of possible base compositions grows accordingly, following a third-degree polynomial expression ( Fig. 3 ). Of course, not all possible base compositions are actually generated with a given set of alleles, and each allele does not necessarily generate its own distinct base composition. The most common way for two alleles to share the same base composition is to differ from each other by one of the six self-cancelling pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (e.g., A \u2192 G and G \u2192 A or A \u2192 C and C \u2192 A). If three SNPs are involved, retrieving the same base composition involves one of the eight possible \"triangular\" mutation patterns (e.g., A \u2192 G, G \u2192 C, C \u2192 A), whereas with four SNPs \"quadrangular\" mutation patterns are possible (e.g., A \u2192 G, G \u2192 C, C \u2192 T, T \u2192 A). As is apparent in Table 1 , the occurrence of such combinations decreases as the number of SNPs increases, meaning that base compositions naturally tend to be more diverse as the number of SNPs increases in the allele set. In practice, a typical PCR/ ESI-MS amplicon of a MLST gene carries from two to six mutations, which is enough to observe a number of distinct base compositions in the same order of magnitude (about 70% on average) as the number of alleles that are distinguished by sequence within the same locus.",

In all cases, a single primer pair targeted to a single allele excluded more than 60% of sequence types on average, and amplification of four loci resulted in elimination of more than 95% of all sequence types on average.

These elements vary in the number of repeats of short strings of nucleotides. Examples of organisms for which VNTR elements have been used to establish clonality are Bacillus anthracis (10) , Francisella tularensis (9) , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (11) . VNTR analysis can be conducted using PCR/ESI-MS simply by designing primers that bracket the VNTR. The base composition of the amplicon is used to precisely calculate the number of repeats as well as any single-nucleotide variations that may appear within the repeat, providing greater resolving power than the repeat count that is obtained from gel analysis. VNTR, SNP, and MLST analyses can be combined into a single assay with PCR/ ESI-MS, if simultaneous analysis of genetic biomarkers with a range of clock speeds is desired, simply by bracketing the appropriate target region on the microbial genome with PCR primers and assembling the primer set in 96-well plate configuration as shown in Fig. 2 .",

During blast injuries, wounds frequently become inoculated with soil organisms, leading to infections that later occur in the hospital. Over Understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying Acinetobacter infections, including the original sources of the infecting organisms, their clonality, and geographical spread, is important for the development of appropriate infection control measures.

At the time the method was developed, there was no MLST database for Acinetobacter, so we used Moraxella catarrhalis (the most closely related organism that had an MLST database) as a model to select the housekeeping genes for sequencing of A. baumannii isolates and to identify regions diverse enough to distinguish between strains by PCR/ ESI-MS. We sequenced regions of six housekeeping genes ( trpE , adk , efp , mutY , fumC , ppa ) from 267 Acinetobacter isolates and designed eight PCR primer target sites covering about 1,700 nucleotides overall.

The goal of this study was to identify the reason for the increased nosocomial Acinetobacter infections observed during this period. Twenty-seven isolates from the outbreak in the military personnel were found to have genotypes representing different Acinetobacter species, including 8 representatives of Acinetobacter sp. 13TU and 13 representatives of Acinetobacter sp. 3. However, most of the isolates from the Iraqi conflict were A. baumannii (189 of 216 isolates). Among these, 111 isolates had genotypes identical or very similar to those associated with well-characterized A. baumannii isolates from European hospitals ( Table 3 ). This observation suggested a second mode for the origin of A. baumannii infections: contamination with European strains that had developed multidrug resistance and properties that favored hospital transmission. Remarkably, isolates from WRAMC showed genotypes from all three major clones I, II, and III obtained from the European hospital collection (16, 17) , suggesting that the U.S. service personnel were exposed to a diverse set of European strain types. -2007 (18) . The distribution of genotypes obtained during this period was remarkably similar to those observed in samples collected during 2003-2004, suggesting a stable reservoir of strain types that continued to infect U.S. service personnel wounded in the war. This composition of genotypes was significantly different from the nosocomial strains identified at nonmilitary U.S. hospitals, dispelling the hypothesis that repatriated soldiers infected with Acinetobacter were having an impact on U.S. nonmilitary hospital infections.",

            "text": "The PCR/ESI-MS technology is also useful for identifying viruses and for tracking the spread of viral infections through a population. Despite higher mutation rates and greater sequence variability than bacteria, conserved primer target sites can be identified that enable priming of entire genera or even complete viral families. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a housekeeping gene common to all RNA viruses that provides several target site opportunities for developing primers that amplify multiple species within a virus family. This strategy is powerful because a single PCR reaction analyzed by MS can be used to detect and identify tens to hundreds of related viral species. The inherently high mutation rate of viruses results in base composition differences that provide a high-resolution molecular signature of viral subtypes. Generally, at least two sets of primer pairs are targeted to different regions of the viral genome for each virus group, and potential misclassification is avoided because two regions taken together provide unambiguous speciation and subtype determination. For example, we used PCR/ESI-MS to identify and subspeciate over 50 types of adenoviruses (6) . This strategy has also been used effectively for detection and strain typing of influenza viruses (5) , alphaviruses (7) , coronaviruses (4) , and orthopoxviruses (3) . Base composition signatures provide a multidimensional fingerprint of the genomes of various viruses and can be used to determine clusters of related species/subtypes. One such representation ( see Fig. 6 ) shows base composition data derived from the primer pairs targeted to PA, PB1, and NP gene segments of influenza A viruses. Human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses clustered independently from each other and from the avian/ human H5N1 and H1N1 viruses. Thus, although mutations occur rapidly in viruses, base composition of certain regions can be used to cluster viruses into groups that are clearly distinguishable. The Ibis T5000 PCR/ESI-MS technology couples PCR to ESI-MS and provides rapid, high-throughput, precise digital analysis of the microbes present in either isolated colonies or original patient specimens. The platform is suitable for use in hospital or reference diagnostic laboratories and other public health settings due to ease of use, high throughput, and affordability. The PCR/ESI-MS method measures digital molecular signatures from microbes, enabling real-time epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigation. The method facilitates understanding of the pathways by which infectious organisms spread and enables appropriate interventions on a time frame not previously achievable.",

The resolution provided by PCR/ESI-MS analysis was evaluated as follows: Starting with the primer pair providing the best sequence resolution, amplicon base compositions were determined for each of the sequence types. Comparison of these base composition signatures defined the number of sequences types that were incompatible with any particular type at this particular locus. The average proportion of sequence types excluded by PCR/ESI-MS with their corresponding standard deviations (vertical lines) was plotted versus the number of loci used in the analysis.
