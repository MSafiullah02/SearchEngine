Ribonucleotide reductase itself, which synthesises deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides, requires complex protein radical chemistry, and RNA world genomes may have reached their limits of coding capacity well before such complex enzymes had evolved. The transition from RNA to DNA thus appears to require intermediate steps, and we suggest that the naturally occurring 2P-O-methylated RNA, with chemical properties intermediate between RNA and DNA, is a suitable candidate.",

On the basis of structure [11] and suggested sequence homology [12, 13] all three classes appear to share a common origin. All require complex protein radical chemistry to reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, though the radical generation mechanism differs between the classes ( Figure 1 ) [10, 14] . The highly complex nature of the reduction suggests that catalytic proteins had to arise before the transition to DNA could occur. Catalytic RNA (ribozymes), almost certainly could not have carried out such free radical chemistry^even if a radical could have been generated it is unlikely it could have been controlled (Table 1) [4, 15] . A salient example of this is the use of radicals in probing of nucleic acid structure. Fe(II)^EDTA generated radicals cleave RNA and DNA non-speci\u00a2cally, regardless of whether single-stranded or double-stranded, and irrespective of local structure [15] . While class II and III reductases use nucleotide cofactors, this does not mean that the reactions would have occurred in the RNA world, though these cofactors may date from the RNA world. It is the cofactors themselves [16] , not the diversity of reactions they are involved in, that date back to the RNA worldt hey have been recruited into many new metabolic pathways during evolution. Given known RNA chemistry, ribonucleotide reduction appears impossible until the development of protein catalysts.",

In class I and III, radical generation and catalysis occur on different subunits. The class I reductases produce a stable tyrosine radical with the help of an ironoxygen centre, and this is transferred to the active site, 30^40 A \u00ee away. In classes II and III, a nucleotide cofactor (adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and AdoMet, respectively) is cleaved to generate a deoxyadenosyl radical (AdoCH b 2 ), which subsequently forms a stable glycine radical in the class III reductase. In the next step the radical in all three classes is transferred to an active site cysteine, forming a thiyl radical. This is then transferred to the 3P position of the ribose, and two cysteines act as reductants in classes I and II, while formate is the reductant in the class III reaction. Once the 2P-OH has been reduced to 2P-H, with regeneration of the thiyl radical, this is transferred back to the tyrosine in class I, to the glycine in class III, while in class II AdoCbl is regenerated. In the class III reaction, AdoMet is consumed in generating the glycine radical, but like the tyrosine radical in the class I reaction, the glycine radical is stable and can presumably support several enzymatic turn-over cycles.",

In all organisms, ribosomal RNA transcripts are 2P-O-methylated as part of the process that produces mature rRNA. Ribosomal processing in eukaryotes uses a number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) required for 2P-O-methylation of rRNAs at speci\u00a2c sites [29, 36] . In bacteria, snoRNAs are apparently absent, and site-speci\u00a2c protein enzymes methylate rRNA [29, 39] .

This may also have been the case for other RNAs, so snoRNA-mediated post-transcriptional methylation could have been of global selective advantage. A recent report describes two C/D box snoRNAs that guide 2P-O-methylation of U6 snRNA [38] ^one of these also directs methylation of 28S rRNA. We take this as support that methylation could have been widespread in the RNA world. We suggest that once RNA-binding proteins arose, the role that methylation played in folding and stabilising functional RNA was gradually replaced by protein^RNA interactions. An explanation for the lack of snoRNA in bacteria is based on this premise [9, 23] .",

The reason is straightforward: each modi\u00a2cation is guided by a site-speci\u00a2c snoRNA approximately 701 00 nt long [29] and, hence, unless each methylation translates to an increase in coding capacity of 70^100 nt or more, the genome gets \u00a2lled up faster than it can increase in size! Some snoRNAs guide more than one modi\u00a2cation, but even so, the implication of snoRNA-mediated modi\u00a2cation is that the number of modi\u00a2cations that could have been maintained on functional RNA was small and limited to the most crucial sites.

While only the latter acts on the 2P-hydroxyl of ribose, both are instructive in trying to understand the possible mechanism of this reaction. Biochemical studies of catechol-O-methyltransferase reveal that the methyl group is almost certainly transferred directly from AdoMet to the oxygen by an S N 2 mechanism, with no methylated enzyme intermediate [42] . Positive charges (Lys-144, Mg 2 , and S of AdoMet) close to the hydroxyl are predicted to promote leaving of the hydrogen, upon which the oxygen would make a nucleophilic attack on the reactive H 3 C^S bond on AdoMet ( Figure 3A) , producing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [40, 42] .

Based on the crystallographic data above, minimal requirements for a simple methylase would be positive charge, dsRNA-binding activity plus snoRNA^rRNA recognition, and AdoMet-binding activity, though the snoRNA/ribozyme could have bound AdoMet ( Figure 3B ). Such simple features are reminiscent of the expected properties of the earliest proteins [23] . We shall \u00a2rst describe the model, then present data suggesting its feasibility. . The role of the protein enzyme may be simply to augment methylation rather than being directly involved in the catalytic step. (B) SnoRNA-dependent modi\u00a2cation of pre-rRNA dates back to the RNA world. As in the modern system, methylation may originally have occurred concurrent with transcription. With the advent of protein synthesis very simple catalysts arose, among these a non-speci\u00a2c dsRNA methylase. The methylase interacted with snoRNAs, being guided or tethered by these to speci\u00a2c sites on the pre-rRNA. The expectation is that this methylase has been retained in the modern eukaryotes and archaea but lost from bacteria. By virtue of its non-speci\u00a2c dsRNA methylating activity, this enzyme is hypothesised to have been recruited into methylation of genomic RNA, improving the stability of the genetic material prior to the origin of DNA. Methylation may initially have been carried out by a ribozyme that associated with each of the methylating snoRNAs, or alternatively methylation could have been carried out by the snoRNAs themselves.

The predicted stabilising effect of 2P-O-methylation on genomic RNA argues that the coding capacity of the genome would have increased suf\u00a2ciently for genuinely catalytic proteins such as RNA polymerase, and later ribonucleotide reductase, to arise, paving the way to the DNA world (Figure 4) . A crucial point is that the methyl-ase could recognise dsRNA in a non-speci\u00a2c manner, allowing it to act on the, presumably, dsRNA of the genome. This amounts to recruitment from RNA post-transcriptional methylation into RNA post-replicative methylation. In this model, no snoRNAs are required for genome methylation, and because the position of methylation is less crucial than for functional RNA, methylation at many points on the genome would be advantageous ( Figure 3B ). In Stepwise increases in genome coding capacity during evolution. The events leading to the origin of DNA can be broken down into a number of steps, with selection acting at each step. This Darwinian approach to understanding complex systems can be further understood in terms of the Eigen limit (see text). In the case of genome evolution, it can be described in terms of a positivefeedback cycle: (1) Each newly selected function permits a greater potential coding capacity. (2) In turn, this permits new functions to arise. (3) These functions are selected for, thus permitting a greater potential coding capacity, and so the process is a positive feedback cycle (This we call the Darwin^Eigen cycle [9] , depicted schematically in pink). Our model cannot determine whether the RNA polymerase arose before the dsRNA methylase or vice versa; we consider both to be essential steps in the origin of DNA, irrespective of order. The later stages, where U is replaced by T, after the evolution of ribonucleotide reduction, are included for completeness and will be discussed elsewhere ( contrast, non-speci\u00a2c methylations of functional RNAs could result in silencing of residues crucial for catalysis and loss of function [46] .",

Complete methylation may in fact be a hindrance, since a hydrophobic`cushion' would form in the deep groove of the RNA [47, 48] . Indeed the partially puri\u00a2ed 2P-O-methyltransferase shows preference for unmethylated RNA over methylated RNA [51] , and increased hydrophobicity might be one explanation for this. Lastly, incomplete, non-speci\u00a2c methylation would have its drawbacks, in that there would be no means of repeatedly methylating the most susceptible sites. The evolution of ribonucleotide reduction would solve these problems ( Table 2) : complete pre-replicative modi\u00a2cation of the 2P-OH is possible; deep groove hydrophobicity is avoided; B form DNA (where bases are buried in the centre of the double helix) may be less likely to suffer base damage than unmethylated or partially methylated duplex RNA.",

The difference between RNA, 2P-O-methylated RNA and DNA is the nature of the group at the 2P position of the ribose (highlighted in red). In RNA the 2P position carries a hydroxyl. The reactivity of this group is a major determinant of RNA catalytic activity. 2P-O-Methyl RNA occurs extensively on eukaryotic and archaeal RNAs, particularly ribosomal RNA, where the reaction is snoRNA-mediated. Site-speci\u00a2c protein methylases catalyse the rRNA methylation in bacteria. Methylation eliminates the propensity for 2P-OH-mediated catalytic activity. In DNA, hydrogen is at the 2P position on the ribose. Ribonucleotide reductases utilise free radical chemistry to reduce the 2P-OH of free ribonucleotides to a 2P-H, forming free deoxyribonucleotides. Bases are shown in blue: uracil in RNA and 2P-O-methyl RNA and thymine in DNA.",

The events leading to the origin of DNA can be broken down into a number of steps, with selection acting at each step. This Darwinian approach to understanding complex systems can be further understood in terms of the Eigen limit (see text). In the case of genome evolution, it can be described in terms of a positivefeedback cycle: (1) Each newly selected function permits a greater potential coding capacity. (2) In turn, this permits new functions to arise. (3) These functions are selected for, thus permitting a greater potential coding capacity, and so the process is a positive feedback cycle (This we call the Darwin^Eigen cycle [9], depicted schematically in pink). Our model cannot determine whether the RNA polymerase arose before the dsRNA methylase or vice versa; we consider both to be essential steps in the origin of DNA, irrespective of order. The later stages, where U is replaced by T, after the evolution of ribonucleotide reduction, are included for completeness and will be discussed elsewhere (Poole, Penny and Sjo \u00eb berg, submitted).
