Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs that can effectively prevent or treat COVID-19 patients. As such, global public authorities have so far relied upon behavioral, non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as use of masks, social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine and even lock-down of entire territories and communities, to contain or, at least, mitigate the burden of the ongoing pandemic [3], [4], [5]. Despite the unprecedented nature of some of these measures, western countries have found it difficult to fully suppress/eradicate the outbreak and have preferred to mitigate it, deciding to opt for a short-period of NPIs, which will be followed by gradual reopening the economy and return to a new normal. Resumption of daily working and social activities is expected to cause further outbreak waves, due to the re-increasing of contact rates.",

Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging. From a clinical standpoint, it would be difficult to distinguish between the two infectious agents, with the definition of COVID-19 cases rather problematic. Moreover, diagnostic tests as well as human resources are limited. Furthermore, currently commercially available rapid diagnostic tests are characterized by a good specificity but have a limited sensitivity, as such not enabling a quick and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19. Altogether, this would significantly impact downstream public health efforts to properly identify COVID-19 cases and contain the outbreak, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.",

Since it took time to increase the production of kits and improve the level of production technology, there was a serious shortage of detection kits during the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemics. To examine the impacts of the limited detection kits on the COVID-19 epidemics in terms of the cumulative number of confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cross-infected cases and the infected population (I(t)), we vary the increasing rate of the available detection kits r\u03c9 in Fig. 4. It follows from Fig. 4 that reducing r\u03c9 will significantly increase both the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases, and the infected population of I(t) and daily cross-infected population at the peak time. Particularly, the cumulatively confirmed cases and cumulatively cross-infected cases will increase 3.5 times (about 2.084\u00d7105 cases) and 4.7 times (about 1.483\u00d7104 cases), respectively, if the exponential increasing rate r\u03c9 decreases by 80 percent.

In addition, comparing the results in Table 2, we find that the impact of increasing rc or rq on mitigating the epidemics weakens as r\u03c9 increases. This implies that rapid implementation of public health interventions, such as reducing contact rate and enhancing quarantined rate, is a good way to compensate the shortage of detection kits, and it is more indispensable for countries with severer limited resource of detection kits.",

This indicates that due to the limited resource of the testing kits, the fast-increased infected population will result in more infections as they are not confirmed and hospitalized. And the situation will become worse if r\u03c9 is smaller, shown in Fig. 5(A) as well. Furthermore, it follows from Fig. 5(B) and (C) that increasing rc or rq can avoid the magnification of the effective reproduction number and make the threshold value reduce to 1 ahead of time, which implies that reducing the contact rate quickly and increasing the quarantined rate can effectively avert the short-term intensification of the outbreak caused by the limited detection kits.",

As shown in Fig. 6, vaccination against influenza could reduce the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and cumulative cross-infected cases, hereafter referred as the reduced confirmed cases and reduced cross-infected cases, respectively. It follows from Fig. 7(A1) and (A2) that getting vaccinated against influenza could significantly reduce the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases with respect to r\u03c9. We give the specific reduction rate with respect to different r\u03c9 and vaccination rate in Table 3. Specifically, when the vaccination coverage rate was 90%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cross-infected cases could reduce by 51.5% and 91.4% with r\u03c9=0.1\u00d7r\u03c90, respectively. We can further observe that the effects of getting vaccinated against influenza weakens as r\u03c9 increases. It means that getting vaccinated against influenza could effectively control the outbreak of COVID-19. Moreover, mass influenza vaccination is more necessary when detection kits are severely limited and under seriously shortage of supply. In another words, mass influenza vaccination can be a much more effective control measure in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemics in the early stage with a rapid growth and the countries or areas with limited testing kits.",
