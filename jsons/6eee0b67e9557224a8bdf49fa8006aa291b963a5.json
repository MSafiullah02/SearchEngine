The topology of the contact network plays a crucial role in these cooperative dynamics. We consider a susceptible-infected-removed-type model with two mutually cooperative pathogens: An individual already infected with one disease has an increased probability of getting infected by the other. We present a heterogeneous mean-field theoretical approach to the coinfection dynamics on generic uncorrelated power-law degree-distributed networks and validate its results by means of numerical simulations. We show that, when the second moment of the degree distribution is finite, the epidemic transition is continuous for low cooperativity, while it is discontinuous when cooperativity is sufficiently high. For scale-free networks, i.e., topologies with diverging second moment, the transition is instead always continuous. In this way we clarify the effect of heterogeneity and system size on the nature of the transition, and we validate the physical interpretation about the origin of the discontinuity.",

            "text": "Recently, Newman and Ferrario [10] introduced a model of coinfection based on the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [11] with two diseases diffusing over the same contact network. One disease spreads freely while the second can infect only individuals already infected with the first. The authors assume total asymmetry and time-scale separation in the spreading of the two pathogens. The system displays two epidemic thresholds, the first one being the usual SIR threshold, the second occurring when the fraction of the population infected with the first disease becomes large enough to allow the spread of the second. No qualitative changes in the nature of the outbreaks appear. In [12] Chen, Ghanbarnejad, Cai, and Grassberger (CGCG) introduced a generalized SIR model (CGCG model) to include mutual cooperative effects of coinfections. In the CGCG model two different diseases simultaneously spread in a population. Having been infected with one disease gives an increased probability to get infected by the other. The amount of this increase is a proxy of the mutual cooperativity between the two diseases. The authors study the model at the mean-field level and observe that cooperative effects, depending of their strength, can cause a change of the transition from continuous to discontinuous. In [13] Janssen and Stenull showed that the CGCG model is equivalent, in the mean field, to the homogeneous limit of an extended general epidemic process and clarify the spinodal nature of the discontinuous transition observed. In [14, 15] CGCG analyzed how in their model the type of transition depends on the contact network topology by simulating the CGCG model on both random networks and lattices. They concluded that a necessary condition for discontinuous transitions to occur, when starting from a doubly infected node, is the relative paucity of short loops with respect to long ones. More in detail they argue that a discontinuous transition occurs if the two epidemics first evolve separately and, only after the independent clusters of singly infected nodes have reached endemic proportions, the two epidemics meet: At that point cooperativity implies that both clusters rapidly become doubly infected. A necessary condition then is that there are few short loops (otherwise, the two pathogens immediately cooperate and the transition is continuous) and there are long loops (otherwise, cooperativity has no effect and one sees only single infections). In agreement with this scenario, CGCG do not observe discontinuous transitions on trees and on two-dimensional (2D) lattices, while they do observe them on Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks, on 4D lattices, and on 2D lattices with sufficiently long-range contacts. On 3D lattices the existence of discontinuous transitions depends on the details of the microscopic realization of the model. Moreover, the observed discontinuous transitions are of hybrid type [16, 17] , i.e., exhibiting also some features of continuous ones. For other recent work about cooperating infections, see Refs. [18] [19] [20] .",

When recovering from one disease an individual becomes immune to that disease, but she can still be infected by the other. The model is totally symmetric with respect to A and B. Since each individual can be in one of three possible states (S, I, R) with respect to each of the two diseases (A, B), there are nine possible states for each individual, denoted by S, A, B, AB, a, b, aB, Ab, and ab, where, for each disease, capital letters refer to the infected state, while lowercase letters refer to the removed state. States denoted by single letters (a, b, A, B) refer to states where the individual is still susceptible with respect to the other disease.",

(1) is finite for \u03b3 > 3, but its value becomes larger as \u03b3 gets smaller. Hence, we do expect that for systems of fixed size N the transition will be discontinuous for large \u03b3 , but the residual clustering will make the transition appear continuous as \u03b3 is reduced. This expectation is tested by simulating the CGCG dynamics on networks of fixed size (N = 10 5 ), large cooperativity (q = 0.99), and growing values of \u03b3 starting from \u03b3 = 3 ( Fig. 1 ). As expected, upon increasing \u03b3 , the transition becomes discontinuous: Short loops become less abundant as \u03b3 grows so that the two infections evolve separately and give rise to cooperative effects only after they meet following one long loop in the network. Further evidence about the same effect is obtained by simulating the CGCG dynamics on a network with fixed \u03b3 = 7 and increasing system size from N = 10 3 to 10 6 (see Fig. 2 ): When the size is big enough, the discontinuity appears.",

In this way we have derived an expression for the epidemic threshold, which does not depend on cooperativity, in agreement with simulations. Moreover, the approach allows us to derive, for power-law degree-distributed topologies, the range of cooperativity values for which the transition is continuous and the associated critical exponent. We find a nice confirmation that the discontinuous transition occurs when cooperativity is sufficiently high and local clustering is instead small. An interesting point in this respect regards what happens for scale-free networks, i.e., for 2 < \u03b3 < 3. In such a case HMF theory predicts that the transition is continuous for any value of the cooperativity W . This is in agreement with the simulation results for BA networks presented in Ref. [14, 15] for networks of moderate size. However, one cannot, in principle, exclude that also for \u03b3 < 3 the continuous transition observed in simulations is just a finite-size effect. While HMF theory seems to indicate the contrary, the global clustering coefficient Eq. (1) vanishes as the system size diverges also for \u03b3 < 3, so that asymptotically there are no short loops in the system. Numerical simulations cannot be conclusive about this question. The issue could be clarified only by a careful analysis of the balance between the relative abundance of short loops (encoded by C) and long loops in the network. It remains as a challenging goal.",

This is possible if \u03c8 = \u03b3 \u2212 3 and if the coefficient (3 \u2212 \u03b3 )(2m\u03b1) \u03b3 \u22122 G(W,\u03b3 \u2212 2) is negative. Since for this range of \u03b3 , (3 \u2212 \u03b3 ) is negative, the condition for the transition to be continuous is G(W,\u03b3 \u2212 2) > 0. Therefore, for a given 3 < \u03b3 < 4 the transition is continuous only for W W c , with W c determined by G(W c ,\u03b3 \u2212 2) = 0; (B12) otherwise, the transition is discontinuous. Figure 5 displays how W c depends on \u03b3 . Starting from \u03b3 = 4 and reducing \u03b3 the value of the cooperativity W c needed for the transition to become discontinuous grows and it diverges as \u03b3 \u2192 3. The critical exponent for the continuous transition is 1/\u03c8 = 1/(\u03b3 \u2212 3) for W < W c . For W exactly equal to W c the coefficient of the term of order \u03c6 \u03b3 \u22123 vanishes; therefore, the continuous transition is possible only when the term of order \u03c6 1+\u03c8 is matched by the next term in the expansion, which for 3 < \u03b3 < 4 is given by the term in \u03c6 2 , yielding \u03c8 = 1. Finally, let us consider the case 2 < \u03b3 < 3. In this range the threshold is \u03b1 c = 0 and we assume \u03b1 = a \u03c6 \u03c8 . The lowest order of the right-hand side of Eq. (B5) is (3 \u2212 \u03b3 )(2ma \u03c6 \u03c8 ) \u03b3 \u22122 G(W,\u03b3 \u2212 2)\u03c6 \u03b3 \u22122 . Since now (3 \u2212 \u03b3 ) > 0 and G(W,\u03b3 \u2212 2) > 0 for any W , there is always a solution (i.e., the transition is always continuous), provided (1 + \u03c8)(\u03b3 \u2212 2) = 1, implying that the critical exponent is 1/\u03c8 = (\u03b3 \u2212 2)/(3 \u2212 \u03b3 ).",
