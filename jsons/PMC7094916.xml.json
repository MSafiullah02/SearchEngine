Nearly 60.8 million were infected with H1N1from April 2009 to April 2010; of these, 274,304 were hospitalized and 12,469 died in the USA [2, 3]. The H1N1 infection was usually complicated by several diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac disorders, bacterial pneumonia and others. Pneumonia was one of the most common complications. Influenza and pneumonia mortality accounted for 2.2% and 2.0%, becoming the eighth and ninth causes of death in 2009 and 2010 in the USA, respectively [4, 5]. Recent studies also revealed that 18\u201361% of hospitalized patients with H1N1 infection had pneumonia characteristics, demanding more attention to influenza-induced pneumonia [6\u20138].",

It is probably because these people have predisposing factors, such as lung disease, malignancy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, affecting the function of T lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, or influenza increases susceptibility to bacterial super-infection by altering defensive mechanisms [9, 10]. Once it occurs, treatment decisions change and the prognosis is greatly different [11]. However, due to the limited case reports in recent years, the robust data on the prevalence, pathogenesis, risk factors and final prognosis of the aforementioned infection are sparse [12\u201314]. In a retrospective study published in 2012, the authors recruited 40 critically ill patients with H1N1 infection and nine of them developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, accounting for 23% [15].",

Also, no difference was observed in the onset to visiting time, aggravation time or ICU time (Table 3). Four patients (23.5%) received corticosteroids before admission to hospital as therapy for \u201csevere acute respiratory distress syndrome.\u201d All patients received antiviral therapies such as oseltamivir and peramivir.

            "text": "Wauters et al. [15] retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the ICU of the two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. These 40 patients had an average APACHE II score of 23 \u00b1 8, an average SOFA score of 11 and a high degree of disease risk. Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23%) developed IPA after 3 days of ICU admission. In contrast, the present study focused on recruiting patients from the department within 4 months, indicating that the virus was more homologous and the differences between individuals diagnosed and treated were small. The average APACHE II score was 17.06 \u00b1 6.81, and the SOFA score was 5.35 \u00b1 3.08. The severity of the disease and organ failure appeared to be less than that reported by Wauter. However, further observations revealed that the patients in the present study had a relatively short period of time from onset to ICU admission, and the statistics included APACHE II scores and SOFA scores within 24 h of ICU admission. After ICU admission, the disease was still in a developing stage and did not reach the critical peak in 24 h. The lowest oxygenation index was 93.34 \u00b1 30.57 mm Hg in the course of the disease. Also, 88% of patients opted for mechanical ventilation and 28% for ECMO. In the study by Wauter, 23.5% of patients opted for ECMO and 88.2% for mechanical ventilation. Hence, the patients in the two studies were quite similar in terms of criticality and disease characteristics. In the aforementioned study, the incidence of invasive fungal infection in the lungs was 9/40 (23%). In the present study, the incidence was 11/19 (58.9%). One possible hypothesis was the evolution of more virulent influenza strains, as exemplified by the pandemic H1N1 strain, causing more severe pneumonia. Compared with previous findings [17], the average viral transposition time of the patients was longer [(10.88 \u00b1 7.81) days] and the duration of the disease increased in the present study. This result also proved the previous hypothesis. A retrospective study found that the risk of IPF infection was higher when respiratory viruses were in circulation, in particular, influenza A [20]. IPF infections were prone to occur during viral infection and replication process. The time between diagnosis of influenza and IPF infection in 11 patients was a mean of 7.3 days (SD \u00b1 0.7). This result was almost consistent with previous findings [21].",

            "text": "Therefore, other mechanisms leading to decreased immune function might exist. Influenza virus affects the production of cytokines, in turn impacting the immune system. H1N1 virus leads to an increased and prolonged production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in plasma. This, in turn, affects Th2 response and adaptive immunity mediated by Th2, which is associated with an increased risk of IPF infection [22]. The influenza virus has been reported to impair phagocytosis and alveolar macrophage function, increasing the risk of IPF infection [9]. The severe systemic inflammatory syndrome, which is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome or immunoparalysis, may occur in patients with severe influenza infection, making them vulnerable to severe super-infections by bacteria and fungi [10].",

In previous studies, a decrease in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count was one of the risk factors for secondary fungal infections [23]. However, this phenomenon was not observed in the present study. Interestingly, the HLA-DR percentage on days 1 and 7 did not differ significantly between the groups. Therefore, the difference in HLA-DR percentage on days 1 and 7 was compared between the two groups in the present study. \u25b3HLA-DR (day 7\u2013day 1) was higher in patients with no IPF infection than in those with IPF infection. The decline in HLA-DR indicated impaired immune function secondary to fungal infection in patients with influenza A/H1N1 infection. With constant exposure to fungi, the normal human immune system developed defenses for fungal clearance via alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells [24]. This study showed that a continuous decline in immune function could lead to the development of IPF infections. In previous studies, most patients with aspergillosis associated with influenza did not have classic risk factors or radiographic findings [25]. Therefore, dynamic monitoring of immune function may help in the early detection of IPF infection.",
