As constituents of plant-rich diets and an assortment of herbal medicinal agents, phenylpropanoids exhibit measurable cancer chemopreventive, antimitotic, estrogenic, antimalarial, antioxidant, and anti-asthmatic activities (Ferrer et al., 2008). In the last two decades, the molecular biochemistry and genomics of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis have attracted widespread interest (Fraser and Chapple, 2011). Due to the important role of PDCs in plant development and the potential value of metabolic engineering of PDC biosynthesis pathways, identification and characterization of genes encoding the enzymes involved in PDC biosynthesis have been carried out in various plant species, such as Arabidopsis (Fraser and Chapple, 2011) and tomato (Adato et al., 2009).",

L. japonica and its substitutes belong to the Caprifoliaceae family, which exhibits accumulation of CGAs in their flowers, stems, and leaves (Chen et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2009). Luteolin is a flavonoid commonly found in fruits and vegetables. This compound has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties (Lim et al., 2012). Both CGAs and luteolin-7-O-glucoside (L7G) are standard compounds used to evaluate the chemical quality of L. japonica. However, only chlorogenic acid is used to evaluate the chemical quality of L. hypoglauca, L. macranthoides, L. confusa, and L. fulvotomentosa (Chinese pharmacopoeia, 2010). The content of chlorogenic acid in buds of L. japonica is higher than in its leaves (Zhao et al., 2010), whereas in L. hypoglauca, buds have lower CGAs than leaves (Deng, 2007).",

In the second stage, luteolin is synthesized under the catalysis of chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavone synthase (FNS), and a P450 modifying enzyme. CGA is synthesized under the catalysis of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT). Bai et al.

Two C4H (LJC4H1 and LJC4H2) and two 4CL (LJ4CL1 and LJ4CL2) exist in L. japonica. C4H is a P450-dependent monooxygenase cytochrome that catalyzes the conversion of cinnamate into 4-coumarate (also known as p-coumarate; Fig. 1) (Lu et al., 2006). LJC4H1 and LJC4H2 showed 53.95% and 60.40% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. They included the consensus Cytochrome P450 domain (IPR001128), suggesting that LJC4Hs have the same type of biochemical activity.

In higher plants, p-coumaroyl CoA represents the starting point for the biosynthesis of not only phenylpropanoid compounds, but a wide variety of other secondary metabolites as well (Vogt, 2010). LJ4CL1 and LJ4CL2 show 18.92% identity at the nucleotide level and 30.30% at the amino acid level.

The buds are used as Jin-Yin-Hua or Shan-Yin-Hua medicine, whereas the stems and leaves are used as Ren-Dong-Teng medicine. Previous studies have indicated that the active compound content differs among the plant parts (Deng, 2007; Zhao et al., 2010). This study confirmed that the chlorogenic acid and luteolin contents are significantly different between the buds and the leaves of L. japonica. Organ preferential expression of PAL, C4H, 4CL, CHS and CHI (Li et al., 2008, Rani et al., 2012, Roslan et al., 2012) is exhibited in the leaves, stem, and roots. PAL1, PAL2, and PAL4 are related to tissue-specific lignin synthesis in the leaves of A. thaliana (Olsen et al., 2008). Few papers have reported on the gene expression patterns in flowers. In this study, genes expressed in buds and leaves of L. japonica were analyzed. However, in the first step of biosynthesis, only the transcripted levels of LJPAL1, LJC4H2, and LJ4CL2 were higher in the buds than that in the leaves. The total activity of C4Hs in the buds was lower than that in the leaves, and PAL and 4CL did not change significantly. In the last step, LJHQTs did not show significant organ preferential expression, suggesting that LJPAL1, LJC4H2, and LJ4CL2 are among the critical genes that regulate CGA content within the organs. The activities of these individual enzymes in L. japonica need to be further analyzed. LJCHS1, LJCHI2, LJFNS1, and LJFNS2 in the last step exhibited bud preferential expression, suggesting that LJPAL1, LJC4H2, LJ4CL2, LJCHS1, LJCHI2, LJFNS1, and LJFNS2 are among the critical genes regulating the luteolin content of the organs. Therefore, only the first step of biosynthesis controls the CGAs, whereas the two steps control the luteolin content in the bud of L. japonica.",

However, the activity of PAL, C4H, and 4CL revealed no significant change in the buds of the three medical species (Fig. 5), similar to the CGA content (Fig. 2).
