PRF is also utilized in the expression of a small number of cellular genes. Frameshifting is typically stimulated by signals contained within the mRNA: a 'slippery' sequence and a 3 -adjacent RNA structure. Recently, we showed that \u22121 PRF in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is trans-activated by the viral 2A protein, leading to a temporal change in PRF efficiency from 0% to 70% during virus infection. Here we analyzed PRF in the related Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). We show that 2A is also required for PRF in TMEV and can stimulate PRF to levels as high as 58% in rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translations and 81% during virus infection. We also show that TMEV 2A trans-activates PRF on the EMCV signal but not vice versa. We present an extensive mutational analysis of the frameshift stimulators (mRNA signals and 2A protein) analysing activity in in vitro translation, electrophoretic mobility shift and in vitro ribosome pausing assays. We also investigate the PRF mRNA signal with RNA structure probing. Our results substantially extend previous characterization of protein-stimulated PRF.",

In viruses, the most common type of PRF involves \u22121 nt tandem slippage of the P-and A-site tRNAs on the mRNA (\u22121 PRF). Many viruses use \u22121 PRF to express the viral polymerase at a set ratio with other components of the replication complex, with examples including HIV and other retroviruses, SARS and other coronaviruses, and many plant RNA viruses (1) . Other viruses use \u22121 PRF to append an extension domain onto a proportion of their capsid proteins (e.g. (2, 3) ), or to express accessory proteins (e.g. (4, 5) ).

            "text": "In eukaryotes, sites of \u22121 PRF normally conform to an X XXY YYZ 'slippery heptanucleotide' shift site motif, where XXX represents any three identical nucleotides, YYY represents UUU or AAA, Z represents A, C or U, and underscores separate zero-frame codons. Such sites allow for P-and A-site anticodon:codon re-pairing following a \u22121 nt shift, except potentially at the wobble positions. It should be noted that the requirement for re-pairing is weaker in the P-site and a number of exceptions to XXX occur, such as GGU, GUU, GUC, GAA, GGA and UCC (1) . While such slippery heptanucleotides may allow frameshifting of up to \u223c1-2% (for some sequences), in order to achieve a high efficiency, an extra stimulator is required and this normally takes the form of a 3 stable RNA stem-loop or pseudoknot structure separated from the shift site by a 'spacer' region of 5-9 nt. Structures of this type are thought to be located at the mRNA unwinding site of the ribosome entrance channel when their stimulatory effect is exerted (10) . How the stimulatory RNAs function to promote \u22121 PRF is still uncertain, but accumulating evidence from prokaryotic counterparts indicates that the RNA structure impedes back rotation of the ribosomal small subunit, trapping the ribosome in a rotated or hyper-rotated state (11, 12) . This stalled state can be resolved either via spontaneous unwinding of the structure or via a \u22121 PRF which, by repositioning the structure within the mRNA entrance channel, is thought to allow for more efficient unwinding by the ribosome (11) .",

            "text": "Intra-mRNA structures normally lead to a fixed ratio of frameshifting, ideal for controlling stoichiometry of different components of the replication complex or different structural proteins. Recent work with porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) (family: Arteriviridae) uncovered a new case of PRF where the stimulator involves, not an intra-mRNA structure separated from the shift site by a 5-9 nt spacer, but instead a protein binding site (CCCANCUCC) separated from the shift site by a 10-nt spacer (13) (14) (15) . The viral protein nsp1\u2424 together with host poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs) bind at this site, and the RNA:protein complex positioned at the leading edge of the ribosome when the decoding centre is positioned on the shift site is sufficient to stimulate \u223c20% efficient \u22122 PRF and \u223c7% efficient \u22121 PRF in virusinfected cells. Even higher levels (up to \u223c50% \u22122 PRF) have been observed in a recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase expression system. More recently, a completely independent case of protein-stimulated PRF was identified in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (family Picornaviridae; genus Cardiovirus) where the viral 2A protein binds to an RNA stem-loop structure separated from the shift site by a 13-nt spacer (16) (17) (18) . Ribosome profiling analyses showed that this RNA:protein complex strongly impedes ribosome progress but that this impediment can be relieved by ribosomes shifting to the \u22121 reading frame on the G GUU UUU shift site. Cellular levels of 2A build up strongly between 4 and 6 h post infection (p.i.), and this correlates with a switch in frameshifting efficiency from negligible levels at 2 and 4 h p.i. to \u223c70% at 6 and 8 h p.i., making this one of the most efficient cases of \u22121 PRF in a mammalian cell system and the only case known to be temporally modulated.",

Our previous work on protein-stimulated PRF in genus Cardiovirus focused on EMCV. Another well-studied member of this genus is Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). The EMCV G GUU UUU frameshift site is conserved in TMEV, as is the presence of a 3 stem-loop structure separated from the shift site by a 13-nt (EMCV) or 14-nt (TMEV) spacer. In TMEV, however, the stem-loop is more compact with a 10-nt loop compared to a 21-nt loop (albeit probably containing internal structure) in EMCV. Further, the TMEV 2A protein shares only \u223c27% aa identity with the EMCV 2A protein. The late-timepoint PRF efficiencies in virus-infected cells have previously been measured at \u223c70% in EMCV (by ribosome profiling) and 74-82% in TMEV (by metabolic labelling, which may be less accurate). However, the role of TMEV 2A in the stimulation of PRF on the TMEV mRNA has not been studied, nor has the ability of TMEV 2A to cross-activate EMCV PRF, or vice versa.",

Thus, TMEV may be a more tractable in vitro system for future structural and biophysical stud-ies of 2A action. We show that TMEV 2A stimulates efficient PRF on both EMCV and TMEV mRNAs whereas EMCV 2A is active only on the cognate EMCV mRNA. Since 2A is known to interact with the viral L protein, we tested whether EMCV L has an effect on EMCV PRF but found none. We also performed an extensive mutational analysis of protein and RNA stimulators of TMEV PRF and tested the effects of these mutations in in vitro translation, electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and in vitro ribosome pausing assays. The predicted TMEV RNA stemloop structure was verified with chemical and enzymatic structure probing. Finally a 2A mutant defective in RNA binding was introduced into the virus genome and tested in the context of infection.

We titrated recombinant TMEV 2A protein into a wheat germ extract (WG) cell-free translation system programmed with a dual luciferase-based reporter mRNA containing the TMEV PRF signal. Following previous work (16), we engineered a U to C change in the loop of the stimulatory RNA to remove the \u22121 frame UAA stop codon, so that ribosomes which frameshift read into the downstream reporter gene ( Figure 1A ). Increasing amounts of 2A led to a general inhibition of cap-dependent translation, as reported previously for EMCV 2A ( Figure 1B) (26, 27) . When the reporter was translated in the absence of 2A, only \u223c1% PRF was observed ( Figure 1B , lane DB). However in the presence of 2A, efficient PRF was observed, to a level of \u223c20% with increasing amounts of 2A ( Figure 1B and C). Similar results were observed in RRL, except that the PRF efficiency plateaued at a higher level (\u223c58%; Figure  1D and E). As a control, we confirmed that inactivation of the slippery sequence (G GUU UUU to A GUG UUU mutation; SS mutant) reduced frameshifting to background levels in both WG and RRL (Figure 2A ). To test whether 2A stimulation was specific to the cardiovirus PRF signal, reporter mRNAs containing the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV; family Retroviridae) or infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; family Coronaviridae) frameshift signals (28) were translated in WG or RRL with or without recombinant TMEV 2A protein. For these signals, addition of 2A had no stimulatory effect on PRF efficiency ( Figure 2B ).",

The EMCV stem-loop structure is supported by enzymatic and chemical structure probing, and a mutational analysis has shown it to be critical for PRF stimulation (18, 30) . To provide support for the predicted stem-loop structure in TMEV we performed chemical and enzymatic structure probing ( Figure 3) . Short, 33 P-labelled RNAs (105 nt) containing the TMEV PRF region (shift site plus 29 nt upstream and 69 nt downstream) were treated with chemical (imidazole, lead acetate; which show specificity for singlestranded regions) or enzymatic (RNase T1; cuts singlestanded RNA after G residues) probes. The cleavage pattern of the RNA was generally consistent with the proposed stem-loop structure, although the upper portion of the 3 arm of the proposed duplex stem was accessible to the single-stranded chemical probes.

In these mutants we altered the 5 part or the 3 part of the stem to disrupt base-pairing, or altered both 5 and 3 parts together to restore the predicted duplex but with altered base-pairings at the three basal positions. However the TMEV loop region was not analysed, and only a limited analysis has been performed in EMCV (namely mutations to the CCC triplet; (18)). Therefore we performed a mutational analysis of the TMEV loop region ( Figure 4A ). Mutation of any nucleotide of the CCC triplet (C50U, C51U, C52U, C50-52A) greatly diminished PRF in both WG and RRL ( Figure 4B and C). Of these, C52U was consistently less inhibitory than the other mutations. Additional mutations within the CCC triplet (C50A, C51A, C51G, C52A; tested only in RRL) also nearly completely abolished PRF ( Figure 4D ). In contrast, mutating the 5 adjacent AAA triplet (A47U, A46-48U) that is conserved in TMEV and related viruses (Saffold, rat theilovirus) and most, but not all, EMCV isolates (Supplementary Figure  S3a of (18)), had little (A47U) or only modest (A46-48U; \u223c1.3-fold reduction in both WG and RRL) effect on PRF. Similarly, the mutation A42U which separated the apical base-pair of the duplex had little effect on PRF. Increasing the loop length by 3 nt (+GAG) had only a modest effect on PRF (\u223c1.3-and \u223c1.6-fold reduction in WG and RRL, respectively). We also mutated the first A of the loop to G (UA/A43G) to, potentially, extend the stem duplex by 1 bp by base-pairing with the 3 C of the CCC triplet (the A43G mutation was performed in the context of the apical basepair A\u00b7U to U\u00b7A mutation, termed 'UA'; see below). Similar to the +GAG mutation, this had little effect on PRF in WG and led to only a \u223c1.6-fold reduction in RRL.",

            "text": "Single nucleotide insertions or deletions within the TMEV PRF region are problematic in that they alter the register to bring +1 frame stop codons (UAA and UAG) within the stem-loop into the \u22121 or 0 frame. To facilitate this analysis, we removed the stop codons by flipping the apical base-pair of the stem from A\u00b7U to U\u00b7A, a variation which is naturally present in rat theilovirus (e.g. GenBank accession EU542581; see also Supplementary Figure S3A of (18)). This mutation (termed 'UA') alone had little effect on PRF ( Figure 5B and C; lane 6). Changes in reading frame as a result of spacer mutations were further compensated by additional single-nucleotide insertions or deletions downstream of the stem-loop so that the 0, \u22121 and \u22122 frame products would migrate at approximately the same positions for all mutants. In the context of the UA mutation, increasing the spacer length by 1 nucleotide (UA/+C28) reduced \u22121 PRF 3-5 fold. In RRL, decreasing the spacer by 1 nt (UA/\u2212A29) reduced \u22121 PRF 4-fold (12%, cf. 48% for UA alone) but also led to a high levels of \u22122 PRF (16%) ( Figure 5C ). The appearance of a \u22122 PRF product is consistent with previous observations of the effect of spacer length mutations in RNA-structure stimulated PRF, where there is potential for (at least) A-site codon:anticodon re-pairing in the \u22122 frame (31). In contrast, in WG, decreasing the spacer length by a single nucleotide (UA/\u2212A29) had no effect on \u22121 PRF (16%, cf. 16% for UA alone) and did not lead to noticeable levels of \u22122 PRF ( Figure 5B ). Such differences between the in vitro translation systems may be a consequence of the slightly smaller footprint of plant ribosomes (32, 33) . We made additional single-nucleotide deletions, UA/\u2212G24, UA/\u2212C25 and UA/\u2212A27. Similar to the UA/\u2212A29 mutation, these had only a small to modest effect on PRF in WG ( Figure 5D ) but resulted in a 4-5 fold reduction in \u22121 PRF and high levels of \u22122 PRF in RRL ( Figure 5E ). Interestingly, the UA/\u2212G24 mutant had a substantially higher level of \u22122 PRF than, for example, the UA/\u2212A29 mutant (41% compared to 18%). It is not clear why this would be the case, but it may be related to effects on chain length from the base composition of the remaining spacer. The UU UUU section of the TMEV shift site is compatible with A-site re-pairing following a \u22122 nt shift but the pentanucleotide CG GUU does not allow obvious P-site re-pairing. We wondered whether the presence of a 5 pyrimidine (C) might inhibit \u22122 PRF occurring on the wildtype (WT) PRF signal. Notably, \u22122 PRF in PRRSV (see Introduction) occurs on an RG GUU UUU shift site (R = purine). However when we mutated the 5 C to G in the TMEV PRF signal (C14G) we did not see appreciable levels of \u22122 PRF for the WT spacer length (Figure 5B and C).",

Normalization of WT by SS allowed the PRF efficiency in the natural context of virus infection to be estimated as 74-82% by 7 h p.i. Having now identified We found that the 2A-mut virus is viable but, like the SS mutant virus tested previously, it has a small plaque phenotype ( Figure 9A ). The protein expression of 2A-mut is similar to SS and both are very different from WT, with much more efficient expression of downstream proteins such as 2B, 2C, 3C and 3D relative to upstream proteins such as VP0, VP3 and VP1 ( Figure 9B ). The 2A-mut protein migrates a little faster than the WT 2A protein. PRF efficiencies were estimated from the ratio of downstream to upstream expression normalized by the SS mutant ( Figure 9C ; see Materials and Methods), giving values of 81% for WT virus and \u22125% for 2A-mut ( Figure 9D ).

Greatly enhanced pausing on a mutated shift site was also apparent in an in vitro pausing assay using a reporter construct ( Figure 10A ) containing the EMCV frameshift sequence translated in the presence of recombinant EMCV 2A protein. To test whether these results extend to TMEV, we translated in wheat germ (WG) a reporter construct containing the WT or SS, TMEV or EMCV frameshift sequence in the presence of recombinant TMEV or EMCV 2A (authentic C-terminus) or TMEV 2Amut (C-terminally extended version). The extent of pausing was assessed by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at the shift site with that of the full-length polypeptide (and also the frameshift product, where applicable).

TMEV 2A was also able to induce pausing on EMCV SS RNA (Figure 10G) ; however the pausing induced by TMEV 2A on EMCV SS RNA was much less pronounced than that induced by EMCV 2A. On the other hand, EMCV 2A was unable to induce pausing on TMEV SS RNA ( Figure 10H ).

Previous work showed that the efficiency of \u22121 PRF in EMCV increases from negligible levels at 2 and 4 h p.i. to \u223c70% at 6 and 8 h p.i, presumably as a result of increasing cytoplasmic levels of 2A (18) . Thus \u22121 PRF in EMCV plays a dual role in (i) allowing late timepoint expression of the 14 kDa 2B* protein, and (ii) down-regulating enzymatic protein expression by \u223c3-fold at late timepoints. In contrast, the 2B* protein in TMEV has only 14 aa, and currently there is no evidence that the peptide is functional (16) . Thus, \u22121 PRF in TMEV may play the singular role of down-regulating enzymatic protein expression at late timepoints. Metabolic labelling indicates that the down-regulation in TMEV may be \u223c5-fold--even stronger than in EMCV. As discussed previously, this provides the virus with an elegant solution to build up replication capacity at early timepoints, In (A, B, E) , WT and all mutant 2As were the C-terminally extended versions (see Methods). In (A-D), numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of 2A with respect to RNA (10 nM). In (E), numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of competitor RNA with respect to 32 P-labelled WT RNA (10 nM). In lanes BSB, DB and H 2 O, RNA was incubated alone with band-shift buffer, protein dilution buffer or water, respectively. while favouring structural protein synthesis at late timepoints (18) .",

The positively charged region, which is essential for binding to the stemloop, also doubles as a nuclear localization signal (26, 27) . Early in infection, 2A is targeted to the nucleus and nucleolus (26) . 2A also binds the virus L protein and is thought to shuttle it to the nucleus, where L directs hyperphospho-rylation of nuclear pore proteins resulting in inhibition of active nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (34) (35) (36) . At later timepoints, 2A accumulates in the cytoplasm where it exhibits a diffuse distribution (26) . 2A also plays a role in shutoff of cap-dependent translation although the mechanism remains elusive (26, 27) . A portion of 2A also associates with cytoplasmic 40S but not 80S ribosomes (41) . More than 40 years ago, 2A was shown to exhibit non-specific RNA binding activity (37) , and we now show that it has enhanced specificity for the cardiovirus PRF stem-loop with a CCC loop triplet being a key part of the recognition motif.",

Specifically, at late timepoints the replication proteins are expressed at a much higher level relative to the structural proteins for the mutant viruses in comparison to WT virus. With the benefit of hindsight, similar protein expression patterns can be seen in the literature for EMCV mutants in which large parts of 2A have been deleted (e.g. (38, 39) ). However, deletions in EMCV 2A may also lead to an impairment of VP0-VP3-VP1-2A processing (38, 39) , which complicates interpretation of these earlier results. TMEV mutants with deletions in 2A--one involving just 11 aa encompassing the conserved basic region altered in our M3 mutant--have been reported and, although virus protein expression patterns were not shown, both mutant viruses were found to be viable but attenuated in BHK-21 cells and were avirulent in mice (40) .",

The large difference between WG (\u223c20%) and RRL (\u223c58%) for the TMEV PRF signal is likely related to structural differences between plant and animal ribosomes (e.g. plant ribosomes have a slightly smaller footprint than mammalian ribosomes) which may affect the geometry of the interaction between the ribosome and the 2A:stem-loop complex; though in principle it could also be due to other host factors (e.g. host proteins) being involved. In contrast, much smaller differences were seen between WG and RRL for the EMCV system (16-21% compared to 14-20%; (18) ). The larger size of the EMCV stem-loop and the EMCV 2A protein may be responsible for this different behaviour. By analogy, in arterivirus protein-stimulated PRF, the efficiency of PRF (both \u22121 and \u22122) is sensitive to whether PCBP1 or PCBP2 is used as the stimulator, and relative efficiencies also vary between WG and RRL systems (15) .",

The ability to reconstitute PRF in WG, despite high divergence between plant and animal proteomes, also suggests that no additional host proteins are involved. In contrast, arterivirus protein-stimulated PRF can only be reconstituted in WG with the addition of both the viral trans-activator (nsp1\u2424) and mammalian PCBP (15) . Further, in previous RiboTrap assays using the EMCV PRF signal and EMCV infected cell lysates, no other proteins were observed to co-immunoprecipitate with the stem-loop at levels similar to 2A (Supplementary Figure S6A of (18) ). The reason for the significantly lower PRF efficiency observed in vitro (\u223c20% in WG; \u223c58% in RRL) compared to virus infection (\u223c81%) remains unknown, but possibilities include incomplete activity of the recombinant 2A, effects of more distal RNA sequences, or differences in translational environment such as salt, temperature, pH and ribosome loading.",
