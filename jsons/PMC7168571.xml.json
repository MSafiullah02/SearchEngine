Cells bearing Fc\u03b3 receptors will uptake opsonized viral particles in a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), thus contributing to the immunopathology (Halstead 1970; Halstead and O\u2019Rourke 1977). The mechanisms generating antibodies of different affinities to DENV remain to be elucidated, especially regarding the B cell differentiation into antibody secreting-plasma cells in lymphoid organs, either through germinal center (GC) reactions or by extrafollicular responses.",

Now, we have assessed in more detail the potential remodeling of the main DLN compartments, we also studied the proliferation and activation on B cells and extended this to the parallel studies of T cells. We found very striking differences between T and B cell responses after DENV infection, with a massive early activation and vigorous proliferation of B cells followed by a significant recruitment of Tingle Body Macrophages (TBMs) inside GCs. Simultaneously, we observed a contrastingly poor, almost absent T cell response during the course of infection.",

Images were captured with a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS Confocal microscopy using \u00d7 10, \u00d7 40 and \u00d7 100 magnification objectives. Images were processed to obtain maximum-intensity projections (MIPs) and then assembled using the Auto-Align Layers tool in Photoshop to obtain the panoramic images of the whole DLNs. Quantification of areas and plot profiles of pixel intensity were obtained using ImageJ software (NIH).",

To evaluate more precisely the effects of cutaneous DENV inoculation upon the B and T cell compartments in situ, and the putative cell proliferation in each compartment, we probed for Ki-67 marker. We found that the B cell follicle area is increased 7 days after DENV infection, rising from 22.3%\u00b1 2.3% of the total DLN area in na\u00efve DLNs to 29.7% \u00b1 0.3% in DLNs from infected animals. The B cell area of DENV-infected mice is hosting much more Ki-67+ cells than na\u00efve follicles do (Fig. 1A, 1B). The number of follicles that become Ki-67+ start to rise after 7 days of DENV immunization (Fig. 1C). While in the na\u00efve follicles there were very few and small Ki-67+ cell aggregates (1.0% \u00b1 0.7%), at day 7 p.i. a big portion of the follicles was occupied by Ki-67+ cells (28.2% \u00b1 4.5%, Fig. 1D). In contrast, the total T cell area (in the paracortex) seems slightly decreased in DENV-infected mice at 7 days p.i., from 64.6% \u00b1 1.6% to 47.4% \u00b1 1.0% (Fig. 1A, 1B). To evaluate the potential role of the sole presence of viral antigens upon lymphocyte activation and proliferation we inoculated mice with UV-inactivated virus (iDENV), which contains all the viral componentes but is unable to replicate. We observed the DLNs of mice inoculated with iDENV behaved similar to the control non-infected group, but the Ki-67+ area started to increase at this time (day 7 p.i.). However, at 14 days post-DENV infection, the B cell area in DLNs is highly expanded, from 22.3% \u00b1 2.3% in non-infected conditions to 43.0% \u00b1 6.3% in infected animals, containing an increased number of proliferating (Ki-67+) follicles, with Ki-67+ cells occupying up to 42.0% \u00b1 3.8% of the follicular area (Fig. 1A\u20131D). In contrast, the DLNs paracortical zone seems decreasing, from 64.6% \u00b1 1.6% to 36.0% \u00b1 5.5 at 14 days p.i. A very similar pattern regarding both compartments was observed at this time point with the iDENV immunization (Fig. 1A\u20131D).",

Ki-67+ cells inside follicles from DLNs of non-infected mice were very scant, and when small clusters were found, they contained (in average) less than 15 cells per follicle. In contrast, the innumerable Ki-67+ proliferating cells inside B follicles of iDENV- and DENV-inoculated mice were very prominent at 14 days p.i. (Fig. 2A). We analysed individual images in two-dimensional graphs of pixel intensity along 300 \u00b5m longitude and observed around 3\u20135 wide-shape peaks in iDENV- and DENV-inoculated mice, indicating a clustering pattern of proliferating cells in this compartment (Fig. 2B). Of note are the dark areas observed in these profiles through the longitude analysed where the peaks decline, which correspond to TBMs containing apoptotic cells (see below). Concomitantly, we analysed paracortical areas where T lymphocytes and dendritic cells are found. It has been documented that after viral cutaneous infections with other virus such as herpes simplex virus, clusters of CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells are present in the paracortex (Hor et al. 2015). However, no clusters of proliferating T cells were seen in the paracortical areas of DLNs from DENV-infected mice (14 days p.i.). Instead, we found few scattered Ki-67+ nuclei with an apparent random distribution, which displayed a very similar pattern with the PBS-inoculated mice (Fig. 2C). The iDENV and DENV plot profiles revealed single peaks of short longitude, indicative of single cells and each one with variable pixel intensity through the 300-\u00b5m longitude analysed (Fig. 2D).",

While assessing the GC reaction to cutaneous DENV infection we performed H&E staining and noticed many condensed nuclei which at a higher magnification looked apparently \u201cclustered\u201d in defined separate groups, suggesting that several apoptotic bodies were probably phagocytosed by macrophages (Fig. 3A). We demonstrated by TUNEL assay many clusters of apoptotic cells inside the GCs (Fig. 3B). To corroborate that the phagocytic population involved were TBMs with apoptotic bodies inside the DENV-induced GCs, we double-labelled DLN sections using CD68 as a pan-macrophage marker and IgD to identify na\u00efve B cell follicles. In DLNs from PBS-inoculated control mice, we found very few and small CD68+ macrophages inside non-reactive (IgD+) B cell follicles. In these control animals the majority of the CD68+ cells were rather small macrophages and were widely scattered all along the medullar areas and the T cell zone (Fig. 3C). In contrast, in DLNs from iDENV- and DENV-immunized mice there were big, reactive, IgD-negative B cell follicles indicating an ongoing GC reaction. The distribution of big CD68+ macrophages was now remarkably confined into the GCs, while some were in the medullar areas and the T cell zones. This was more clearly seen at panoramic view at lower magnifications, suggesting a massive TBM recruitment into the GCs 14 days after DENV infection (Fig. 3C). Inside these large GCs, we found high numbers of big CD68+ TBMs representing 37.6 \u00b1 4.0 per follicle in DENV- and 28.5 \u00b1 4.5 in iDENV-inoculated mice, respectively, compared to only 6.6 \u00b1 0.8 of them in control DLNs (Fig. 3D).",

We evaluated the expression of the CD69 activation marker in DLN lymphocytes of the three experimental groups. We observed that, compared to non-infected mice, both iDENV as well as DENV, elicited some expression of CD69 in the CD4+ T cells from 3 days after immunization (Fig. 5A). This profile of CD69 expression on CD4+ T cells is maintained until 23 days p.i. in DLNs from DENV-infected mice but not in iDENV-immunized mice (Fig. 5B). In comparison, the basal expression of CD69 on the CD8+ T cells showed some increase at 3- and 7-days p.i., but did not change at later times along the study (Fig. 5A, 5B). In contrast, after 3 days of DENV infection, B cells showed an strong upregulation of CD69 decreasing at days 7 and 14 and increasing by 16 days p.i., with some decrease by day 23 p.i. (Fig. 5A, 5B). Thus, CD69+ B cells arose from very low levels, 1.9% \u00b1 0.4% in uninfected conditions, to reach the highest expresion at 3 days p.i. and with 35.4% \u00b1 1.8% and 29.0% \u00b1 7.3% at 16 days post DENV infection (Fig. 5A, 5B). This increase represents 1764.7% and 1431.9% of change from the basal expression at 3- and 16-days p.i., respectively. By comparison, CD4+ T cells just show 84.3% of change compared to the na\u00efve cells, whereas CD8+ T cells reach only 48.0% of change at 16 days p.i. (Fig. 5C).",

We therefore assessed the nuclear expression of Ki-67 protein by multicolor flow cytometry in B lymphocytes, and in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6A, 6B). A very low basal percentage of B cells show proliferation in DLNs from non-infected mice, 2.27% \u00b1 0.3%, but this percentage rises dramatically to 33.1% \u00b1 2.4% with DENV and to 25.3% \u00b1 3.2% with iDENV at day 16 p.i. (Fig. 6B). In the case of T lymphocytes, in CD4+ T cells we did not find even a minor proliferative reaction to DENV, with 3.1% \u00b1 0.4% in DENV-infected mice compared to 4.1% \u00b1 0.8% in iDENV-inoculated mice and 3.2% \u00b1 0.3% in non-infected animals. Likewise, we did not see any increase (over the basal levels) in the proliferation of CD8+ T lymphocytes after 16 days of DENV infection, with 3.3% \u00b1 0.2% in na\u00efve mice versus 2.2% \u00b1 0.3% and 2.0% \u00b1 0.3% of CD8+ T cells 16 days after iDENV and DENV, respectively. At earlier time points of infection (7 days p.i.), we found a very similar pattern where B cells, but not the T cells, show a vigorous proliferation (Fig. 6B).",

We found some apoptotic bodies in the T cell zone of DENV-infected mice, compared to control mice where no apoptotic bodies were identified (Fig. 7A). To evaluate this phenomenon with a more specific approach, we looked for active caspase-3 in situ, a key enzyme in the execution of apoptosis. Furthermore, another hallmark of apoptosis is the cleavage of DNA, which can be revealed by the TUNEL assay. Thus, we performed both techniques in DLNs of control and DENV-infected mice to ascertain the apoptotic cells in the whole paracortex (Thy 1.2+ area). We found very few T lymphocytes expressing caspase 3 under infection (Fig. 7B). Likewise, scarce TUNEL+ apoptotic T cells were found in the paracortex of DLNs from DENV-infected mice. In both cases, the percentages lacked statistically significant differences, compared with the non-infected mice (Fig. 7C).",

            "text": "Since one of the crucial risk factors to develop severe dengue is the prior immune response to DENV and considering that T and B lymphocytes encompass the specificity and memory of adaptative immune responses, it is conceivable that they could be involved in DENV immunopathology (Burke et al. 1988; Graham et al. 1999; Endy et al. 2002). However, their potential protective versus pathological role in the disease is not fully understood, especially for T lymphocytes (Malavige and Ogg 2013; Screaton et al. 2015; Rivino 2016). This, in part might be due to the fact that DENV specific T cells represent a very low proportion of circulating cells during the acute phase (median 0.75%, mean 2.3%) (Friberg et al. 2011); no response, up to 0.1% and 2.5% (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2006); 0.02%\u20132.5% (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2003), when the severe symptoms start. Rather, a differentiated form of B cells, the plasmablasts, have been found as high as a 1000-fold increase, constituting up to 30% of the total PBMCs, in some cases even mimicking a plasma cell leukaemia during acute DENV infection (Gawoski and Ooi 2003; Balakrishnan et al. 2011; Wrammert et al. 2012). Most of these plasmablasts (70%) recognize DENV (Wrammert et al. 2012) and are serotype cross-reactive (Garcia-Bates et al. 2013), thus revealing the important involvement of B cells.",

Using a previously established model of cutaneous DENV infection in immunocompetent mice (Yam-Puc et al. 2015), we found by in situ evaluation and single-cell analysis, a nearly absent T cell proliferative response to DENV infection (measured by the expression of Ki-67), in both the CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells. In line with this, a lack of T cells expansion, an impaired proliferation, defects on IFN-\u03b3 production, and suboptimal T cell degranulation in the acute phase have been documented in patients, some reports attributed the poor T cell response to apoptosis (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2003, 2006; Dung et al. 2010). To explore this last possibility in our model, we assessed cell death in DLNs by three different approaches but we did not find a significant increase in T cell apoptosis ratio under DENV compared with non-infected controls, suggesting that apoptosis might not be the major determinant for T cell unresponsiveness.",

Other authors have shown decreased T cell proliferation in vitro due to defects in the accessory cell population in PBMCs (during acute dengue illness), seemingly related to low supply of IL-2 and IL-7 cytokines (Mathew et al. 1999). Dendritic cells as targets for DENV infection (Wu et al. 2000) and replication might be impaired to prime T cells. This has been confirmed in vitro, but only in certain DC subsets or when using high load of viral MOIs (Nightingale et al. 2008; Cerny et al. 2014).",

Another possibility is the upregulation of inhibitory molecules such as PD-1, LAG-3 and CTLA-4, indeed they have been found increased in T cells during DENV infection (Chandele et al. 2016). On the other hand, costimulatory molecules in dendritic cells have been found diminished after in vitro infection (Nightingale et al. 2008), all these events could impact an optimal T cell priming by antigen presenting cells (APCs). As we did not observe any increase in the proliferation nor in the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after iDENV and DENV inoculation, and since T lymphocytes are not a direct target for DENV (Blackley et al. 2007), it could be that DENV replication is not directly triggering this T cell unresponsiveness.",

We found a prominent increased expression of CD69 in B cells mainly at 3-days and until 23-days after cutaneous DENV infection. In contrast, T cells showed a very minor expression of CD69 compared to basal conditions, and it was much lower when compared to CD69 upregulation by B cells. Downregulation of CCR7 on T cells has been reported (Chandele et al. 2016) and together with the low expression of CD69 that we observed, this could indicate that T cells might not be retained inside DLNs, since is reported that CD69 participates in preventing lymphocytes leaving the lymph nodes (Cyster and Schwab 2012).",

Since the proportion of B cells in the blood of DENV patients is just mild or not substantially increased, there is the possibility of B cells being retained in lymphoid organs (Jampangern et al. 2007; Garcia-Bates et al. 2013; Nivarthi et al. 2019). The idea of B cell proliferation in lymphoid organs during the natural infection is supported by the fact that numerous plasmablasts are found in the circulation of DENV-infected patients (Wrammert et al. 2012; Garcia-Bates et al. 2013). In line with the lymphocyte retention theory, we found CD69 strongly expressed in DLN B cells. CD69 blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, presumably allowing more time for further differentiation (Cyster and Schwab 2012).",

In fact, polyclonal B cell activation induced by DENV and evidenced by production of IgM and IL-6 has been demonstrated in vitro, apparently mediated by CD81 (a crosslinker of CD19 and BCR) (Correa et al. 2015).

As we previously reported big GCs in DLNs after cutaneous DENV infection, plus the high rate of proliferation inside B cell follicles, made us to consider the possibility that B cell responses or maturation via the GC reaction could be altered. It is worth mentioning that the classical compartmentalization of GCs in light zone and dark zone was absent in our studies, apparently due to the large expansion of proliferating B cells inside follicles upon DENV infection. Of note, along with the extensive B cell proliferation, we found a high number of CD68+ TBMs and many dead cells, but exclusively in the B cell proliferating area (dark zone). This was detected by histology and confirmed by TUNEL. Normally, most TBMs (75%) would appear in the light zone (Hardie et al. 1993; MacLennan 1994). In fact, TBMs have been reported in human lymphoid tissue from fatality cases due to DENV infection (Aye et al. 2014).",

More detailed studies not only on B cell differentiation through the study of the GC microanatomy, but also of the affinity maturation, selection and the production of protective and non-neutralizing antibodies and memory cells, are all of great interest and suitable to perform in this in vivo model.
