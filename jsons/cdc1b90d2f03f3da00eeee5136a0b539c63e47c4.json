The emergence of new pathogens for which there is no effective treatment has redrawn the attention to the usefulness of convalescent plasma. Indeed, convalescent plasma can be an alternate and fast therapeutic option in outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Chikungunya, Ebola and Zika [2] [3] [4] . The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has prompted not only a search for effective antiviral treatment and spread control measures, but also a reconsideration of the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment [5, 6] .",

Besides, there were organizational and technological challenges in the collection, production and use of the products [3] . Nevertheless, the BTS was able to collect the volume of plasma needed for the production of H-IVIG despite various limiting factors (e.g. difficult or failure to contact) as well as the impending urgency to accomplish the recruitment and collection within the shortest possible time. It provided an excellent opportunity to the BTS in the mobilization of existing resources and expertise within a short period of time to cope with the recruitment of large number of recovered patients. Further refinement of local factors for recruitment strategy and operational logistics would be beneficial in the event that large-scale plasma collection is needed [8] . Though convalescent plasma was obtained from patients who had confirmed recovery from infection and developed humoral immunity, for the safety, those willing to participate must meet donor selection criteria as well as in compliance with existing policies and routine procedures. Per our experience, as many as 291 of 784 potential donors (37\u00c11%) were screened out because of failure in health history screening, unfavourable vein size, inadequate haemoglobin level and platelet count for plasmapheresis, failed laboratory screening for infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, syphilis and insufficient neutralizing antibody titres (Fig. 1) [8] . As a responsible blood service, protection of donors' welfare, blood safety and quality were always important and should not be compromised.",

Following the reports of beneficial responses to convalescent plasma, the Ministry of Health of China updated recently their draft treatment protocol to second edition [10] . With the previous experience of convalescent plasma collection and the various clinical results for its use in different respiratory tract infectious diseases [7, 9, 11, 12] , it is conceivable that in the battle of COVID-19 pandemic, preparation of collecting convalescent plasma should be planned now. On one hand, it is important to stand ready to provide adequate safe and effective products that could potentially save many lives in this pandemic. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that its collection, production and use take place in accordance to all necessary ethical considerations so as to produce an evidence base for its role in managing the severely COVID-19 affected patients.",
