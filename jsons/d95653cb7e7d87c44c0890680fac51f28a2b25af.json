Our study, which, to our knowledge, is the largest to date evaluating the association of PCT with pneumonia etiology, provides important data to complement these trials. Among the 738 patients with a PCT <0.1 ng/mL in our study, 3% had a typical bacterial pathogen detected and 3% had an atypical bacterial pathogen detected; among the 1022 patients with a PCT <0.25 ng/mL, 4% had typical bacteria and 4% had atypical bacteria detected. While these results demonstrate lower frequency of bacterial pathogens in patient populations with PCT below both the 0.1 ng/mL and 0.25 ng/mL thresholds, some individual patients with bacterial pathogens did present to the hospital with low PCT levels, highlighting that clinicians cannot rely on PCT alone to guide antibiotic treatment decisions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 754, "end": 758, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1070, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1074, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1078, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1082, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1236, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1240, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1244, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Interestingly, PCT values for patients with atypical bacteria were more similar to those with viruses than typical bacteria. This was particularly true for Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila, but not Legionella. Routine coverage for atypical bacteria in empiric antibiotic CAP regimens is controversial because Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila infections are often self-limited with low mortality risk, and clinical trial data have failed to consistently demonstrate improvement in patient outcomes when atypical coverage is added to \u03b2-lactam monotherapy [31] . Proponents of empiric atypical coverage note that antibiotics improve outcomes for patients with Legionella pneumonia and may shorten the duration of symptoms for Mycoplasma pneumonia [30] . Because of this controversy, we analyzed our data with the atypical bacteria grouped with typical bacteria, and then with atypical bacteria grouped with viruses. Our results suggest that PCT is a better marker for typical bacteria than for the combined group of typical and atypical bacteria. Although the small sample size of patients with Legionella pneumonia (n = 21) prevented robust evaluation of PCT specifically in Legionella in this study, relatively high PCT in these patients suggests that the PCT response to Legionella pneumonia may be more similar to that of typical bacterial pneumonia than Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila pneumonia. If this is confirmed with future studies, elevated PCT indicating increased probability of a pathogen necessitating prompt antibiotics (typical bacteria or Legionella) and low PCT indicating increased probability of a pathogen not requiring prompt antibiotics (viruses, Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila) could be a useful paradigm. A strength of our study was systematic, protocol-driven pathogen testing, which included both traditional culture-based and serology testing, as well as PCR-based techniques [7] . Despite this thorough testing, 62% of patients had no pathogen detected. This high proportion of patients with unknown etiology is similar to other contemporary CAP studies [14, 33] , and presents a challenge for evaluating the accuracy of PCT for identifying bacterial pneumonia. Ideally, PCT would have been evaluated in a population of CAP patients who all had identified pathogens, enabling complete and precise classification of bacterial and nonbacterial disease. Unfortunately, identification of pathogens in all patients was not possible with currently available tests. Therefore, our approach included calculating PCT accuracy within both a microbiologically confirmed population (n = 645) of patients with identified bacterial and viral pathogens and the full population (n = 1735) including patients without any pathogens detected. Both of these populations have limitations. The microbiologically confirmed population is not directly generalizable into clinical practice because clinicians do not know which patients will test positive for pathogens when making initial decisions about antibiotics. Meanwhile, the full population likely included some patients who were misclassified into the nonbacterial group due to failure of pathogen testing to detect some of the relevant bacteria. Together, these complementary analyses provide an estimated range for the accuracy of PCT to identify bacterial CAP. It will be important to reassess PCT accuracy as pathogen testing for CAP improves and more patients can be classified into bacterial and viral groups [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 545, "end": 549, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 736, "end": 740, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1891, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2071, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2075, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3461, "end": 3465, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In prior work, Kruger et al [14] studied PCT in a population of 1337 inpatients and outpatients with CAP, including 472 patients with an identified pathogen.

Second, while some protocols recommend serial PCT measurements to guide antibiotic prescribing [34] , we only measured PCT at the time of hospital admission. Third, invasive diagnostic testing (eg, thoracentesis, bronchoscopy) was only utilized when deemed medically necessary by the treating physicians; study-dictated invasive tests may have resulted in more patients with an identified pathogen. Fourth, all detected pathogens may not have represented causative agents for pneumonia; for example, viruses detected in NP/OP swabs may have represented infection limited to the upper airways or asymptomatic shedding [35] .

Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals. Dashed lines show the overall prevalence of any bacteria (A and C) or typical bacteria (B) without considering PCT level. The x-axes were truncated at a PCT of 15 ng/ mL due to the small number of patients with concentrations above this level. bacterial pathogen (n = 1499) resulted in an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 (95% CI, .68-.75) (Figure 3C). A PCT threshold of \u22650.1 ng/mL resulted in sensitivity of 80.9% (95% CI, 75.3%-85.7%) and specificity of 46.2% (95% CI, 43.7%-48.8%) for identification of patients with any bacterial pathogen", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Author contributions.
