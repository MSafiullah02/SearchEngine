The clinical manifestations of viral gastroenteritis include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, anorexia, headache, abdominal cramps, and myalgia.2 The enteric viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis include rotavirus A (RVA), rotavirus B (RVB), rotavirus C (RVC), Caliciviruses (Norovirus and Sapovirus), enteric adenovirus, human astroviruses, aichiviruses, toroviruses, coronaviruses, picobirnaviruses, enteroviruses, and Sali/Klassi viruses. Globally, RVA is the main cause of sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis in children less than 5 years of age and outbreak cases in infants hospitalized, day care centers, and old age individuals.3 The circulation of RVC, in individuals of all age groups has been documented in sporadic and large outbreak cases from different parts of the world.4 In contrast, RVB infections in sporadic and outbreak cases are mainly restricted to Asian countries namely China, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal and largely during gastroenteritis outbreaks in adults.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Among non\u2010rota viral agents, Norovirus, Astrovirus, and Adenovirus infections have been reported to be predominant and known to be responsible for different gastroenteritis outbreaks globally.14, 15, 16 The transmission of these viruses could be water\u2010borne, food\u2010borne, person\u2010to\u2010person, and a variety of less clearly identifiable modes.",

A case of acute diarrhea was defined as the occurrence of \u22653 loose stools in a day among the residents of Devli Karad village since 17th November 2017. This village is situated in a remote rural area connected only by roads and on around 300 km from the ICMR\u2010National Institute of Virology (ICMR\u2010NIV), Pune, the laboratory involved in the investigation of this outbreak. Maintaining the cold chain for storage and transport of clinical samples is very difficult in such a setting. Therefore, fecal specimens were collected from 10 representative patients admitted on 21st and 22nd November 2017 for investigation of enteric viral agents. These ten patients were between 13 and 40 years (median, 31 years) of age and six of them were males. Eight of the ten patients were from eight different families and not living in the same house and not sharing meals. Duizer et al17 reported Norovirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) positive results, even in a single fecal specimen out of three or more are sufficient to assign it as the causative agent of the corresponding outbreak. The minimum number of specimens required to confirm RVB etiology during the outbreak could not be estimated due to the absence of data on the prevalence rate of RVB in adult diarrheal patients as well as in a healthy population.",

However, the possibility of low exposure is excluded in the present study as the source of drinking water was the same for all villagers. Similarly, RT\u2010PCR, the only method used globally for RVB detection is known for its high sensitivity.

Apart from this, cross\u2010protection due to other serotypes especially RVA, the known leading cause of gastroenteritis in children needs to be monitored in future to find out the reason behind the low attack rate of RVB in children.
