            "text": "The innate immune response against PRRSV is very weak, probably contributing to the delay in subsequent humoral and cellular immune responses, and also to virus persistence (Kimman et al., 2009). PRRSV does not induce interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 production (Albina et al., 1998, Calzada-Nova et al., 2010), a key element in host antiviral response, leading to a minimal production of inflammatory cytokines and activation and recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells (Murtaugh et al., 2002). PRRSV-induced suppression of type I IFN production is due to the interference in the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), located downstream of sensor molecule RNA helicase RIG-I. The inactivation of IPS-1 avoids IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 activation and, consequently, type I IFN production (Luo et al., 2008). Therefore, to design an effective vaccine against PRRSV, it would be advisable to increase the production of type I IFN. To date, different adjuvants promoting the production of IFN have been tested, in addition to the current vaccines formulations, with limited success (Charerntantanakul, 2009).",

            "text": "A hallmark of the swine humoral response against PRRSV is the production of non-neutralizing antibodies detected early in the infection, followed by a low neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer that is detected more than 3 weeks after infection (Kimman et al., 2009, Murtaugh et al., 2002). One possible explanation for the late detection of NAbs is the difference on technique sensitivity, as ELISA has higher sensitivity than neutralization assays. Therefore, the presence of very low titers of NAbs early in the infection cannot be completely discarded. Early non-neutralizing antibodies are mainly induced by nucleocapsid (N), M and GP5 proteins, and have been involved in antibody-dependent enhancement of PRRSV infection (Mateu and Diaz, 2008, Murtaugh et al., 2002). NAbs are induced by GP3, GP4, GP5 and M proteins, although the ones recognizing GP5 are the most relevant for protection (Kim and Yoon, 2008, Ostrowski et al., 2002). Two B cell epitopes were identified in GP5 protein ectodomain: an immunodominant epitope (IDE), that has been proposed to act as a decoy epitope, and an epitope critical for neutralization (ECN), that is recognized by NAbs (Ostrowski et al., 2002). Several hypothesis have been proposed to explain the delay in NAbs induction by GP5 protein, such as the presence of the IDE, and glican-shielding of the ECN (Lopez and Osorio, 2004). The role of NAbs in protection was demonstrated by passive transfer of these antibodies (Osorio et al., 2002). Protection of swine against PRRSV infection correlated with the level of NAbs and it was proposed that an efficient vaccine must induce NAb titers of 1:32 to prevent PRRSV infection (Lopez et al., 2007).",

It has been shown that the induction of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells, complementing neutralizing antibodies, provides partial protection against PRRSV (Zuckermann et al., 2007). As interleukin (IL)-10 levels inversely correlate with IFN-\u03b3 response, it has been proposed that the expression of IL-10 may be responsible for the suppression of T cell responses (Charerntantanakul et al., 2006, Kimman et al., 2009). M protein is the most potent inducer of T cell proliferation, followed by GP5, GP3 and GP2 (Bautista et al., 1999), and may play a role in protection. Different vaccine adjuvants have been tested to improve T cell responses to PRRSV. Nevertheless, in addition to the adjuvants included in vaccine formulation, only IL-2 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides enhanced protection conferred by current vaccines (Charerntantanakul, 2009).",

Nevertheless, minor structural proteins are also required for PRRSV virion infectivity (Wissink et al., 2005) and may play a role in protection.

Porcine Treg phenotype is CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ (Kaser et al., 2008), as that described for human and mice (Belkaid, 2007). Tregs have been classified in natural and induced. The latter ones can be subdivided in three subtypes: Treg1 (TR1) secreting IL-10, T helper 3 (Th3) secreting transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and converted Tregs (Belkaid, 2007). It has been recently described that American type PRRSV-infected dendritic cells induced Tregs, an effect that was reverted by the addition of IFN-\u03b1. The induced Treg population is a Th3 type, as it promotes TGF-\u03b2 but not IL-10 expression (Silva-Campa et al., 2009). In contrast, dendritic cells infected with EU type PRRSV viruses did not induce Treg cells, although they exhibited an unbalanced ability to stimulate T cell immune responses (Silva-Campa et al., 2010). The impact of Treg induction on delayed immune responses after PRRSV infection remains to be established, as well as the viral proteins involved in this process.",

Among the structural proteins, M protein is the most conserved one, while GP5 is the most variable one (Dea et al., 2000). This high antigenic variability represents a problem for the development of universal vaccines against PRRSV, as shown by the low efficacy of current vaccines against heterologous challenge. To solve this problem, common critical B and T cell epitopes must be identified (Mateu and Diaz, 2008). Nevertheless, it has been reported that the ability of a vaccine to induce a strong cellular immune response may be more important for protection than the genetic similarity with the challenge strain (Diaz et al., 2006). An additional problem is the difference in the immune responses elicited by PRRSV in animals with different host genetic background (Lewis et al., 2007). Therefore, the knowledge of host responses to PRRSV infection is required for the development of an efficient vaccine.",

In order to eradicate the virus, modified live vaccines have been successfully used. All the vaccine strains were gE\u2212 phenotype, i.e., have a gE gene deletion. The elimination of gE causes virus attenuation by reducing the virus transmission, but does not reduce virus production in cell culture nor the induction of protective immunity (Nauwynck et al., 2007). These live attenuated PRV have been used as vectors to protect against swine infectious diseases, such as classical swine fever (Hooft van Iddekinge et al., 1996), or porcine circovirus (Ju et al., 2005).",

As a consequence, the protection conferred by this vector was evaluated in the porcine respiratory model, in relation to the protection provided by a commercially available PRRSV killed vaccine. Animals inoculated with the recombinant PRV expressing PRRSV proteins developed NAbs before the challenge. Furthermore, after challenge, the NAb titer was up to 4-fold higher in animals inoculated with recombinant PRRSV compared with those inoculated with the killed vaccine. None of the animals inoculated with the empty PRV developed neutralizing antibodies at any time during the experiment (Jiang et al., 2007c). Lymphocyte proliferative responses were also higher in animals inoculated with the recombinant PRV expressing GP5m and M proteins. Accordingly, lung lesions and viremia were lower in these animals, indicating a certain protection against the homologous challenge (Jiang et al., 2007c).",

MVA is highly attenuated, even in immunosuppressed animals, but induces strong humoral and cellular immune responses (Wang et al., 2007). Four recombinant MVA viruses expressing PRRSV antigens were constructed, expressing GP5 or M proteins alone, GP5-M fusion protein, or co-expressing GP5 and M proteins (Zheng et al., 2007). These vectors were tested in the mouse model. Mice inoculated with recombinant MVA expressing heterologous antigens developed PRRSV neutralizing antibodies, with the highest antibody titers found in mice inoculated with the recombinant MVA co-expressing GP5 and M proteins. Similar results were obtained when IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production was analyzed, indicating a Th1 type cellular immune response (Zheng et al., 2007).

PRCV is spread worldwide and induces antibodies that can also neutralize TGEV (Saif et al., 1994). Therefore, preexisting immunity against the TGEV vector could have been a problem. Nevertheless, in vivo experiments showed that antibody titers against TGEV increased even after two re-infections of pigs with rTGEV vector (Alonso S., Sola I. and Enjuanes L., unpublished results). One of the main advantages of recombinant TGEV (rTGEV) as a vector for PRRSV is that TGEV is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b1 in a process that is mediated by the virus transmembrane (M) protein (Calzada-Nova et al., 2010, Charley and Laude, 1988). In addition, as mentioned above, TGEV vectors may present antigens at mucosal sites, eliciting mucosal and systemic immune responses. Therefore, rTGEV vectors will represent a novel strategy to study the induction of protection against PRRSV.",

            "text": "PRRSV structural proteins GP5 and M accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells, where they form disulfide-linked heterodimers that are incorporated into the virion. M protein homodimers are also detected in infected cells, but are not incorporated into the virus particle (Dea et al., 2000, Meulenberg, 2000). GP5 and M proteins are essential for the production of viral particles, although additional minor envelope proteins are required for virion infectivity (Wissink et al., 2005). According to the accepted topology of the GP5-M heterodimer (Fig. 1\n), both GP5 and M proteins expose a short ectodomain on the virion surface, being involved in receptor recognition. GP5 ectodomain contains several glycosylation sites, depending on the viral strain. It has been described that GP5-M protein heterodimer formation is previous to GP5 glycosylation (Mardassi et al., 1996). GP5 glycosylation sites are close to the ECN epitope, and it has been proposed that the steric hindrance caused by the glycosylation is one of the causes for the potential delay in the production of NAbs after PRRSV infection (see below). It has been recently described that GP5-M heterodimer interacts with the PRRSV receptor, porcine sialoadhesin, and that this interaction is dependent on GP5 glycosylation, most likely at the glycosylation site overlapping with the epitope recognized by neutralizing antibodies (Van Breedam et al., 2010). As described above, GP5 and M proteins have been involved in the induction of PRRSV neutralizing antibodies and a strong cellular immune response, respectively (Bautista et al., 1999, Ostrowski et al., 2002). These data indicate that the GP5-M heterodimer is the most promising antigenic structure that could be used in the construction of an efficacious vaccine against PRRSV.",

GP5 expression was driven by the transcription-regulating sequence of gene 3a (TRS3a), while M protein was expressed from an optimized TRS partially derived from gene N (TRS22N) (Alonso et al., 2002). Therefore, PRRSV genes were expressed from independent subgenomic mRNAs. The recovered virus expressed GP5 and M proteins in 85% and 95% of the rTGEV infected cells, respectively (Fig. 3(B)). Expression levels were maintained even in virus recovered from tissues after infection of piglets with the rTGEV. This result substantially advanced the efficacy of previous rTGEVs expressing individually PRRSV antigens, showing high expression levels of GP5, but with limited stability. Co-expression of M protein with GP5 reduced GP5 toxicity and probably will elicit a better T cell immune response. The protection conferred by this vector was tested in vivo. One-week-old piglets were inoculated with 1 \u00d7 108\n pfu of the rTGEV by three routes: oral, nasal and intragastric. Nine weeks later, a challenge was perfomed with 1 \u00d7 107\n TCID50 of a virulent European PRRSV strain. Blood samples were collected at different times post-inoculation, and humoral immune responses were evaluated by ELISA. All animals presented a high antibody response against TGEV, therefore, the vector infected target tissues as expected. Vaccinated animals also showed a clear humoral response against PRRSV GP5 and M proteins. A fast recall of the immune response was observed after the challenge, as vaccinated animals induced higher antibody titers against PRRSV antigens and earlier than control ones. Nevertheless, the immune response elicited by this rTGEV provided very limited protection, and antibody titers decreased before challenge. The lack of protection against challenge was likely due to the relatively low levels of neutralizing antibodies produced before challenge. Nevertheless, results using rTGEV as a platform were promising, as a humoral immune response against PRRSV antigens was elicited.",

            "text": "The ectodomain of GP5 protein is N-glycosylated. There are three or four predicted glycosylation sites in the GP5 from the North American strains of PRRSV, whereas there are only two sites in the GP5 protein from European strains (wt, Fig. 3(A)). The relevance of the N-glycans in GP5 antigenicity is not clear. It has been proposed that the removal of the glycosylation sites could lead to the improvement of the immune response against PRRSV, due to the elimination of the steric hindrance raised by the carbohydrate on the epitope inducing NAbs (Ansari et al., 2006). Elimination of the glycosylation sites present only in the North American strains, both in engineered and natural PRRSV mutants, led to an increase in the levels of NAbs induced by the mutant viruses (Ansari et al., 2006, Faaberg et al., 2006). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that these sites are not present in European PRRSV strains. Although the elimination of the glycosylation site overlapping the epitope critical for neutralization (G1) (Fig. 3(A)) often leads to non-infectious viruses (Ansari et al., 2006, Wissink et al., 2005), natural North American strain mutants lacking this glycosylation site were found (2.1% of the sequenced GP5 proteins). Surprisingly, one of this natural mutants elicited lower neutralizing antibody response than the wild-type PRRSV strain (Faaberg et al., 2006). This is in contrast with the data obtained with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), where deletion of the N-glycan enhanced the NAbs response (Plagemann and Moenngin, 1997). Elimination of the most conserved N-glycosylation site (G2, Fig. 3(A)) (only 0.2% of the sequenced North American GP5 proteins lack this motif) led to higher levels of neutralizing antibodies compared with the response elicited by the wild-type virus (Ansari et al., 2006). As glycosylation of GP5 is probably also involved in virus infectivity, it is difficult to analyze the influence of N-glycans on the immunogenicity of the protein. In the rTGEV system, PRRSV GP5 and M are not involved in infectivity and, therefore, the relevance of these proteins antigenicity in protection could be analyzed in our laboratory using the rTGEV vector.",

A second immunodominant epitope (IDE) was described in the ectodomain of GP5, close to the ECN (Fig. 3(A)) (Ostrowski et al., 2002). It has been suggested that this immunodominant site could be responsible for the delay in the production of NAbs against PRRSV acting as a decoy epitope. Antibodies against IDE and ECN epitopes were found in the sera of PRRSV infected pigs, appearing at different times post-infection. Furthermore, an increase in the titers against ECN correlates with a decrease in the level of antibodies specific for IDE (Lopez and Osorio, 2004, Ostrowski et al., 2002). An enhanced immunogenicity of a recombinant GP5 protein in which a synthetic sequence spacer has been introduced between IDE and ECN epitopes, to better display the neutralizing epitope has been reported. The data suggests that IDE is in fact acting as a decoy epitope (Fang et al., 2006).",

MA-104 or ST cells were infected with PRRSV and the rTGEVs, respectively, and double immunofluorescence staining was performed. As shown in the merge (Fig. 4, lower panels), colocalization of GP5 and M proteins was observed both in the PRRSV and rTGEV infected cells. This result suggests that the GP5-M heterodimer is formed in both cases. The decrease in GP5 expression levels by the introduction of GP5 mutations suggested that the modifications could affect heterodimer formation. Colocalization of GP5 and M proteins was also observed when a mutant GP5 protein (i.e., GP5-N46S, or GP5-\u0394IDE-N46S) was expressed by the rTGEV vector (Fig. 4), suggesting that a heterodimer was also formed by mutant GP5 proteins.

Groups of six 1-week-old piglets were intramuscularly inoculated with the formulation to evaluate the protection conferred by this vaccine. A boost was performed 3 weeks after inoculation. Six weeks after the first inoculation, animals were challenged by intranasal inoculation with 107\n TCID50 of PRRSV/Olot91 strain. Blood samples were collected at different times post-inoculation to determine the levels of specific antibodies by ELISA. Vaccinated animals induced higher and faster antibody titers against PRRSV antigens than control animals (Fig. 5(A), left panel). Neutralizing antibody titers were also higher in the vaccinated animals when compared with non-vaccinated animals (Fig. 5(A), right panel). Viremia, gross lesions, and histopathology in the lungs of vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals were analyzed.

Blood samples of animals we collected at indicated times post-inoculation. Samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) specific to detect antibodies against TGEV, GP5 and M. To evaluate response against GP5, GP5 protein from PRRSV Olot91 strain was expressed and purified from insect cells and used as antigen for the ELISA. (B) Lung damage caused by PRRSV infection. The lungs from animals inoculated with empty rTGEV vector, or rTGEV expressing GP5-N46S and M proteins, were analyzed. Lung lesions observed in all the pigs, with different degree of severity, included a craneo-ventral consolidation of apical and medial lung lobes.",
