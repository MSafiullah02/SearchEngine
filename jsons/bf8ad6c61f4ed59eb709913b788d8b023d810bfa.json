The infection was probably described by Hippocrates 2400 years ago when he wrote: \"There is fever, chill, pain in the head, the underpart of the jaw is swollen: the patient swallows with difficulties his saliva. The patient cannot spit, he cannot tolerate to lie down, and if he stays in this position he chokes\" [1] . In 1791, the first clear description of acute epiglottitis was published, and the term \"epiglottitis\" was coined in 1830 [2] . Invention of the laryngoscope in the 1850s allowed direct visualization of the swollen epiglottis, and soon thereafter the mirror examination of the hypopharynx and larynx became widely practiced. In the early twentieth century, the term \"acute epiglottitis\" became part of standard medical terminology and the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disease became clear. The prognosis of the disease improved in some cases with tracheotomy, tracheostomy, or intubation. George Washington, the first president of the United States, died in 1799 of an acute infection that was probably epiglottitis [3] . A tracheotomy (a new procedure then) was proposed by one of his physicians but not performed. The major advance in treatment of epiglottitis occurred following the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century. The introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in 1985 dramatically decreased the incidence of epiglottitis, especially in the pediatric population. The vaccine was improved (conjugated vaccine) in 1987 and 1990 so that efficacy extended to children younger than 18 months.",

In Finland, 50-60 cases per year of epiglottitis were seen throughout the country in 1985-1986, and this decreased to only two cases in 1992, reflecting the widespread use of the Hib vaccine [4] . In Sweden, the incidence of epiglottitis in children under age 5 decreased from 21 to 0.9 cases per 100, 000 following Hib vaccination [5] . The median age of children affected by epiglottitis has also increased in the Hib vaccine era.

Awake fiberoptic intubation can be attempted in the cooperative patient as an initial attempt to secure the airway. Direct and videoassisted laryngoscopy may be attempted, but the necessary sedation requires rapid access to airway and associated swelling and secretions can limit visualization. If an emergency surgical airway is required, the type depends on the age of the patient. Needle cricothyrotomy can be performed on patients of any age, but this is the preferred surgical technique in children under age 12. Needle cricothyrotomy is easier to perform and less likely to damage the larynx in young children than surgical cricothyrotomy. Needle cricothyrotomy provides stabilization of the patient allowing a formal surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or tracheotomy to be performed in a controlled manner.

Epiglottitis, which used to be prevalent in children under age 5, is now seen more often in adults than in children. This decline in childhood epiglottitis is due to the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. Streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, are now important causes of epiglottitis. Croup is a viral infection, usually due to parainfluenza virus, that primarily affects children ages 6 months to 3 years old. Epiglottitis and croup can cause sudden and life-threatening loss of the airway, and misdiagnosis or mismanagement can result in fatalities. With appropriate management, however, death from these infections is very rare.",
