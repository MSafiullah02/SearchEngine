In addition, the presence of specific antivirals also serves as a selective factor resulting in fast emergence of drug-resistant virus strains. Taken together, these processes lead to the selection of viral variants that are capable both of escaping the immune inactivation by neutralizing antibodies and of overcoming the suppressive action of antiviral drugs.",

Ribavirin and favipiravir are antivirals of broad range of activity, which exhibit a suppressive effect against almost all RNA-genome human viruses.5 Meanwhile, being a nucleoside analog, ribavirin possesses numerous side effects, including the reduction of haemoglobin level, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, etc.6\n",

For a long time, the technology for isolating this compound from camphor tree wood has been known in China in Japan. The analeptic properties of camphor have been known since the 18th century. Today, it is used to treat acute and chronic heart failure, respiratory depression, soporific and narcotic poisoning, as well as an agent for topical use.24 A typical feature of a camphor molecule is its cage-hydrocarbon (rigid) structure that is similar to a certain extent to that of adamantane.

Therefore, despite structure similarity of substances under investigation with the known anti-influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine, as well as with other M2 cage inhibitors, the mechanism of activity of symmetric camphor-based diimines should be different. Initially, adamantane derivatives were shown to interact with amino acids within the M2 proton channel.30 Recently, another adamantane-binding site was discovered in M2.31, 32 The mutations conferring amantadine- and rimantadine-resistance are located in transmembrane domain of M2 facing inside the channel. S31N is the most widely distributed mutation among drug-resistant strains. Due to spatial limitations, few modifications and side groups can be introduced into adamantane derivative without lacking its ability to fit into proton channel.

MDCK cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 in the presence of the dissolved substances. The degree of destruction of the cell monolayer was then evaluated in the microtetrazolium test (MTT). The cells were washed twice with saline, and a solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Aurora, Ohio) (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) in saline was added to the wells. After 1 h incubation, the wells were washed and the formazan residue dissolved in DMSO (0.1 ml per well). The optical density of cells was then measured on a Victor 2 1440 multifunctional reader (Perkin Elmer, Finland) at 535 nm and plotted against concentration of the compounds. Each concentration was tested in three parallels. The 50% cytotoxic dose (CTD50) of each compound (i.e., the compound concentration that causes the death of 50% cells in a culture, or decreasing the optical density twice as compared to the control wells) was calculated from the data obtained.",

The infection activity of the virus was evaluated in the hemagglutination reaction with chicken erythrocytes. A virus-containing solution (100 \u03bcl) was placed in the wells of a round-bottom plate. An equal amount of a 1% suspension of chicken erythrocytes in saline was added. The reaction was evaluated after 60 min incubation at room temperature. Each concentration of the compounds was tested in three parallels. A virus titer was considered as reciprocal to decimal logarithm of maximum dilution that caused complete agglutination of erythrocytes and was expressed in logarithms of the 50% experimental infection dose (log10 EID50). The antiviral activity of the compounds was estimated by the decrease in the virus titer as compared to the control. The 50% effective dose (ED50) of the drug, i.e., the concentration at which the virus production decreased by a factor of two (a virus titer per 0.3 log10 EID50) and the selectivity index (the ratio between CTD50 and ED50) were calculated from the data obtained.",
