In dogs and cats, the ileum communicates directly with the colon, and what is referred to as the cecum in the dog and cat is actually a diverticulum of the proximal colon. The colon is further compartmentalized into ascending, transverse, and descending portions, each segment having slightly different functions and properties. The right colic or hepatic flexure separates the ascending and transverse colon, and the left colic or splenic flexure separates the transverse and descending colon. In dogs and cats, the large intestine contributes 20% to 25% of the total (small and large) intestinal length.1, 2\n",

The epithelium in the lower half of the crypts is composed of proliferating undifferentiated columnar cells, mucus-secreting goblet cells, and at least three types of endocrine epithelial cells.4 Cellular proliferation is predominantly in the lower part of the crypts in both dogs and cats. The epithelium of the upper half of the crypts consists of differentiating columnar cells, goblet cells, and a few endocrine cells. The flat absorptive surface is lined by many columnar cells as well as a moderate number of goblet cells (10 to 25 goblet cells per 100 epithelial cells),3, 5 most of which are largely depleted of their mucous granules. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are relatively sparsely distributed throughout the epithelium (one to seven lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells),3, 5 and as in the small intestine, the predominant T cell subset is the cytotoxic-suppressor (CD8+) type.6, 7 The cellular elements of the lamina propria of the large intestine resemble closely those found in the small intestine and include lymphocytes, many plasma cells, mast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, enteric neurons, and fibroblasts.",

For example, the protein and fiber content of the diet have significant effects on colonic mucosal morphology (e.g., crypt depth and cellularity).14, 15, 16 The pathologist should always take these factors into account when interpreting colonic biopsy specimens. The method of biopsy also influences the architecture and cellularity of the mucosa. Compared to full-thickness biopsies, gland length is 25% to 30% shorter and goblet cell numbers are 70% to 75% less in endoscopic biopsies from the same animals. The shallow depth of the endoscopic biopsy apparently causes glandular collapse, and enema or cathartic preparative solutions are believed to cause discharge of mucous goblets.3, 11\n",

Approximately 1.35 L is absorbed in the jejunum, 1.0 L in the ileum, and 315 mL in the colon, leaving 35 mL in feces.18 Thus, the jejunum absorbs 50%, the ileum 75%, and the colon 90% of fluid volume presented to it (Figure 58-3\n). This fluid absorptive capacity of the colon is largely determined by basal electrolyte (primarily sodium) transport and by the ability of several agonists (aldosterone and glucocorticoids) to augment electrogenic and electroneutral Na absorption. As long as ileocecal flow is less than the colonic absorptive capacity, significant alterations in small intestinal fluid movement may be present, but colonic absorption will prevent the development of diarrhea. On the other hand, when small intestinal absorption and ileocecal flow are normal, a relatively small decrease in colonic absorption (inflammatory bowel disease) will produce significant increases in fecal water output.",

Active nutrient (glucose, amino acid, monoglyceride) transport is prominent in the small intestine, but there is no evidence of active glucose or amino acid absorption in the colon except during the early neonatal period. Sodium transport also differs in the colon. Glucose- and amino-acid\u2013stimulated sodium transport is a well-established property of the small intestine, so much so that oral glucose-electrolyte solutions have been used to reduce the morbidity of cholera and other infectious diarrheal diseases of the small intestine. In contrast, glucose-coupled sodium transport does not take place in the colon and glucose-electrolyte solutions are of no benefit in diarrheal diseases of the large intestine. Sodium transport in the colon instead relies upon electrogenic transport.20, 21 The large intestine also differs in its response to mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone markedly increases sodium transport in the colon, but it has only a modest effect in the small intestine. Net sodium absorption ceases in the colon only when the luminal sodium concentration is reduced below 30 to 50 mEq/L, whereas net sodium absorption in the jejunum occurs only at luminal sodium concentrations above 130 mEq/L.21\n",

As in the small intestine, appropriate interactions between these different cell types are essential in generating either immune responsiveness or tolerance to the large array of luminal antigens.26, 27 Much less is known about colonic immunity, but some generalizations may be made. In the colon, CD8+ T cells are found primarily in the epithelium; very few CD8+ T cells are found in the lamina propria or submucosa. Most intraepithelial lymphocytes are CD3+/CD8+, a phenotype consistent with suppressor-cytotoxic functions. Lamina propria T cells on the other hand are predominantly of the CD4+ helper phenotype. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A-containing plasma cells are more prominent than IgG- or IgM-containing plasma cells in the lamina propria. Thus, in the normal colonic mucosa, a balance would appear to be maintained between helper and suppressor T-cell populations, which allows specific antigen responsiveness while avoiding hyperreactivity.5, 6, 28 There are many similarities in the immune systems at both sites, but there are important differences in the immune response of the small and large intestine.",

The time course, frequency, and force generated by each of these contractions are significantly different from each other.30, 31, 32, 33 The precise role of tone in circular muscle cells is not known, but the resulting decrease in the diameter of the colon may enhance the efficiency of the phasic contractions in mixing and propulsion. Tone is normally of small to moderate force and can last for prolonged periods of time (several minutes to hours). RPCs produce mixing and net slow distal propulsion of luminal contents in the postprandial and fasting state. Phasic contractions occur rhythmically at a few cycles per minute, last for approximately 3 to 5 seconds, and generate a moderate force (75 to 100 g). RGCs occur infrequently, last for approximately 20 seconds, generate a very strong force (>150 g), and are propagated from their point of origin into the ascending colon. RGCs facilitate mixing in the ascending colon. The GMCs are of a similar magnitude and frequency to the RGCs, but they generate mass movements from their point of origin to the anorectal junction. It has been suggested that different signal transduction pathways are used by smooth muscle cells to trigger different contractions.34, 35 It is remarkable that the same smooth muscle cells can generate so many different types of contractions using a limited number of second messengers.",

Among their physiologic effects, SCFAs promote differentiation and proliferation of colonocytes,38 stimulate absorption of water and electrolytes,39 provide 7% to 10% of an animal's overall energy requirements,37 and influence or modify motility of the gastrointestinal tract.40\n",

As with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the tip of the endoscope should never be advanced unless the lumen is in full view.

To facilitate passage of the endoscope through the splenic flexure, the tip of the endoscope is deflected slightly upward, and the endoscope is pushed into the transverse colon. The transverse colonic mucosa is now more visible as the endoscope enters the short, straight segment of the transverse colon. At the hepatic flexure, the tip of the endoscope is deflected caudally to enter the ascending colon.

The cecum is easily inspected, and the endoscope is then advanced through the ileocecal sphincter to evaluate the distal ileum.

Cultured primary canine colonocytes can express NOD2, TLR2, and TLR4 when stimulated by their respective ligands.6 In a study investigating TLR expression profiles in endoscopic biopsies, it was found that dogs with chronic enteropathies that needed steroid treatment to keep their symptoms controlled had increased levels of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression compared with healthy dogs.7 However, no difference in TLR expression was detected between biopsies sampled before and after clinically successful therapy, regardless of whether dogs had been treated with diet or steroids.7, 8 Another study identified a correlation between clinical severity of disease and expression of TLR mRNA. Duodenal mucosal mRNA expression of TLR2 was markedly increased in dogs with clinically severe IBD when compared with healthy controls, and TLR2 expression was correlated with clinical severity of diseases in a linear fashion.8 Breed differences in TLR expression profiles have been reported in dogs with IBD. German Shepherd Dogs (GSD) with IBD have increased levels of TLR4 mRNA and decreased levels of TLR5 mRNA in the intestine compared to healthy greyhounds.8a Differences in TLR expression mimic those reported in people with Crohn's disease and have prompted genetic investigations into polymorphisms of pattern recognition receptors in dogs with IBD. In GSDs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR4 and TLR5 have been associated with an increased incidence of IBD.8b SNPs in TLR5 are associated with increased risk of development of IBD in 38 other breeds, and have been shown to be functionally hyper-responsive in GSD. This particular mutation may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs in general.8b Finally, although it does not appear that food antigens play a direct role in the pathogenesis of human IBD, various dietary components can exert deleterious or beneficial effects on the intestinal microflora and on the intestinal mucosa, making it plausible that dietary changes could influence the inflammatory process in the mucosa of dogs with IBD.9 To date, the effects of dietary antigens on canine and feline IBD have not been studied in detail. However, dietary treatment is viewed by most as an integral part of the therapeutic approach to chronic inflammatory GI diseases.",

Immunohistochemical studies have shown T and B lymphocytes, as well as IgG-positive plasma cells to be increased in the colonic mucosa of dogs with IBD.9, 10, 11 Semiquantitative RT-PCR has been used to evaluate cytokine mRNA expression in colonic mucosal biopsies. Human ulcerative colitis patients typically show a Th2 dominated inflammatory response.2 In one study the prevailing cytokine mRNA expression pattern in dogs was that of a Th1 immune response.12 Nevertheless, the accuracy of these results has since been questioned, at least in the duodenal mucosa, where the more reliable quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed a lack of difference in cytokine mRNA expression between healthy dogs and dogs with IBD.13 However, colonic cytokine mRNA expression has not been investigated again using the more accurate amplification techniques, and it is prudent not to overinterpret the results from the initial study. To date there are no published data about cytokine expression in feline colitis, but duodenal mucosa of cats with IBD revealed a complex pattern of cytokine mRNA expression with a possible increase in Th1 cytokine mRNA expression.14, 15\n",

In humans, as well as in dogs and cats, adverse reactions to food can result from immunologic (food allergy) and nonimmunologic (food intolerance) mechanisms.16 So far, in small animals, the clinical differentiation between food allergy and food intolerance relies heavily on restricted antigen dietary trials.17, 18 All dogs and cats with GI manifestations of adverse reaction to food get better when fed a novel diet, especially if it is designed to avoid antigens from their original diet. When challenged with their original food, they all show a relapse of GI signs. However, only food-allergic dogs and cats also relapse when their low-allergen diet is supplemented with proteins from a single source such as beef, chicken, milk, or any protein that was part of their original offending food.17 Finally, a number of animals with colitis may simply benefit from being fed a highly digestible diet. These dogs and cats may have mild IBD that responds to the novel diet, which usually also offers additional benefits, such as an improved ratio of n6-to-n3 fatty acids or the presence of prebiotics.

Colonic inflammation disrupts these normal events. It may decrease the total absorptive capacity of the mucosa through loss of functional colonocytes, increased epithelial permeability and disturbance of sodium and chloride transport.19 Additionally, colitis has direct effects on colonic motility. The colon exhibits three types of contractions: While the individual phasic contractions and the migrating and nonmigrating motor complexes produce extensive mixing and kneading of fecal material and slow net distal propulsion, the giant motor complexes (GMCs) produce mass movements and expel feces during defecation.20 In an experimental model, dogs with acute colitis had a decrease in nonpropulsive motility and an increase in GMCs, resulting in frequent defecation and tenesmus.21 Decreased nonpropulsive motility may be explained by disturbances of the circular colonic smooth muscle cells associated with inflammation. These include impairment of calcium mobilization,22, 23, 24 changes in expression of key signaling molecules for excitation\u2013contraction coupling,25 inhibition of muscarinic signaling,26 and increased transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB).27 Finally, absorptive and motility disorders may change the composition of the luminal commensal flora, which plays an important role in the maintenance of colonic function, and therefore contribute to further deterioration.",

Moreover, lymphoma or other neoplasia can infiltrate the large intestine and cause identical clinical signs to those of inflammatory diseases. Finally, cecal intussusception, although rare, is another differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious colitis. In cats with clinical signs of colitis, it is generally recommended to search for concomitant involvement of the small bowel as enterocolitis appears to occur more frequently than isolated colitis in that species.",

The precise clinical relevance of serum markers of autoimmunity such as perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies still remains to be determined in dogs with IBD, but they may be suggestive of diet-responsive disease.33 A parasitologic examination of one or several fecal samples is necessary to rule out parasite infestation. Alternatively, empirical treatment with broad-spectrum parasiticides such as fenbendazole (50 mg/kg PO daily for 3 days) will eliminate most GI nematodes and protozoa. Cytologic examination of rectal scrapings can reveal the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum, large numbers of neutrophils, a sign of inflammation, or increased numbers of Gram-positive rods (suggestive of overgrowth with C. perfringens).34 Usually, diagnostic imaging (radiographs and ultrasonography) is not very helpful in cats and dogs with colitis.

Additionally, it is often possible to pass the endoscope into the ileum. Changes noticed during colonoscopy may include an increase in friability, granularity, or hyperemia; changes in the numbers of lymphoid follicles; decreased visualization of submucosal blood vessels; localized colonic spasms; and localized erosions.31 Significant edema and inflammatory infiltrate may give the mucosa a honeycomb appearance (Figure 58-7\n); however, the colonic mucosa may also appear normal.31 The endoscopic procedure also makes it possible to collect mucosal biopsies to evaluate the histopathologic appearance of the mucosa. As the colon can usually be easily distended, it is advisable to use an endoscope with a large-bore biopsy channel that makes the use of large biopsy forceps possible (\u22652.8 mm diameter). Rigid proctoscopy/colonoscopy is an alternative method for procuring good size colonic mucosal samples.",

The addition of soluble fiber to the diet has provided additional benefits in clinical studies of canine and feline chronic colitis.30, 31 Fermentable fibers are metabolized to short-chain fatty acids by the large intestinal flora and provide a useful source of energy to the colonocytes. Overall, they enhance structure and function of the intestinal epithelium.41 Examples of fermentable fibers include beet pulp, psyllium, and fructooligosaccharides. Fructooligosaccharides are oligosaccharides that resist digestion in the small intestine and are fermented by the colonic bacterial flora. Their beneficial effects on the large intestine include proliferation of colonocytes by increasing blood flow to the colonic mucosa and promotion of epithelial cell differentiation into fully functional colonocytes.41 Additionally, fructooligosaccharides are prebiotics and therefore are able to influence the composition of the large bowel commensal flora. In cats, they were reported to increase colonic fecal concentrations of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus spp. and decrease those of E. coli and C. perfringens.42 Finally, dietary fibers also have beneficial effects on colonic motility. As a tradeoff, addition of fiber to the diet may have a negative impact on nutrient digestibility, depending on the specific fiber type. Some fibers may also delay gastric emptying time and slow small intestinal transit time.41 Psyllium is a soluble fiber derived from the seed of Plantago ovata. It has great water-holding capacities and forms gels in water, two properties that can contribute to improvement of fecal consistency. Psyllium was very efficient when added to a highly digestible diet in the treatment of chronic idiopathic colitis using the following initial daily dosage: 0.5 tablespoons (T) for toy breeds, 1 T for small dogs, 2 T for medium dogs, and 3 T for large dogs.31 The fiber supplement should be administered with each meal, and the dose adapted to effect.",

If a suspension is administered to a cat, metronidazole HCl is not a palatable formulation and may elicit ptyalism and anorexia. Metronidazole benzoate is the preferable formulation for feline patients, but it contains only 62% metronidazole and therefore requires a dose adjustment. Other side effects of metronidazole are rare, although cats may be more susceptible because of the probable increased half-life of the drug, and include vomiting and diarrhea.

            "text": "Sulfasalazine consists of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; also called mesalamine [United States] or mesalazine [Europe]) linked by an azo bond to sulfapyridine, a sulfonamide compound.46 Most of the orally administered sulfasalazine reaches the distal small intestine and colon unchanged. There, the microbial flora breaks the azo bond and liberates both molecules. Sulfapyridine is essentially a carrier molecule and is not thought to unfold any therapeutic effect. It is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and filtered through the kidneys. The antiinflammatory effects of 5-ASA on the colonic mucosa are associated with inhibition of cyclooxygenase and a decrease in prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. Moreover, 5-ASA is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3.46 In dogs, PPAR-\u03b3 are expressed at a high level in gastric, duodenal, and colonic mucosal epithelial cells.47 They inhibit pathways leading to increased NF-\u03baB transcription and hence to production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.46 However, recent data do not support a decrease in PPAR in the colonic mucosa of dogs with colitis.48 The main side effect of sulfasalazine is keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, sulfapyridine is likely responsible for damaging lacrimal glands.49 Early detection followed by treatment discontinuation is necessary to prevent the onset of irreversible KCS. Consequently, tear production must be measured at regular intervals in all dogs receiving sulfasalazine. Vomiting may also occur, and can be prevented if the drug is administered with food. Other drugs with the same mechanism of action are available and include olsalazine (two molecules of mesalamine linked by an azo bond) and other formulations of mesalamine coated with an acrylic resin that release the compound in the distal small bowel or colon. Although these drugs have not been extensively tested in small animals, KCS has been reported with their use in dogs.",

Their therapeutic interest also relies on the multiple effects they have on both the innate and adaptive immune response.50 However, because of their multiple side effects, immunosuppressive doses of prednisone should be reserved for dogs that have undergone colonoscopy, and for which a histologic diagnosis confirms the existence and type of the inflammatory infiltrate. Cats do not appear to develop as many side effects from glucocorticoid therapy as dogs. Additionally, cats may not tolerate TID medication with sulfasalazine, and are more susceptible to mesalamine toxicity. Moreover, many cats with colitis also have lesions in the small intestine (enterocolitis) on which sulfasalazine has no effect.

If sulfasalazine is used, it can often be discontinued after a few weeks. However, there is a risk of recurrence when the animals are switched back to their original diet or a commercial diet. Therefore, the owners of dogs and cats with colitis should be prepared to feed their pets a special diet in the long-term, and consider the financial implications of the prolonged treatment. In a few cases, colitis may be refractory to treatment. This is probably most common in cats showing predominantly large bowel diarrhea, while in reality they have a general involvement of their GI tract (enterocolitis). In dogs with IBD, several negative prognostic factors have been identified that all reflect severe involvement of the small intestine, including hypoalbuminemia, hypocobalaminemia, severe duodenal lesions, and a high clinical disease score.28, 52 Therefore, they do not appear to apply to colonic IBD.",

The recent success of antibiotic treatment raises the question of an infectious origin; however, this hypothesis has been investigated previously. The role played by macrophages containing cytoplasmic material stained by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) is intriguing, and early electron microscopic studies have demonstrated so-called residual bodies, which resemble bacteria-like organisms in granules of PAS-positive macrophages.64 These particles contained parallel pairs of membranes and electron-dense particles ranging in size from 100 to 500 nm, and may have represented bacterial cell membranes. Therefore, specific infectious agents, such as Mycobacteria, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Rickettsiales ssp. have all been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.55 However, attempts to reproduce the disease by infecting dogs with Mycoplasma spp. have failed.",

Electron microscopy of HUC lesions allowed identification and localization of the bacteria to the intracellular compartment of PAS positive macrophages.65 Additionally, the intracellular material found in PAS-positive macrophages from dogs with HUC was positively labeled with polyclonal antibodies against E. coli.66 Further classification of the virulence genes and biologic behavior of these bacteria in coculture with epithelial cells and macrophages revealed specific adhesive and invasive properties.65 The E. coli strains associated with HUC have a similar phenotype with adhesive and invasive behavior resembling E. coli isolates that were recently associated with Crohn's disease in people.65 In several studies, a particular strain of E. coli (LF82) could be detected in biopsies of 20% to 35% of ileal lesions in Crohn's disease, but only in 6% of ileal samples from healthy controls or other colonic inflammatory diseases.67 Crohn's disease affects primarily the mucosa and submucosa of the ileum and colon. It resembles canine HUC in its histologic appearance, as granulomas are the main feature of the disease. As in canine HUC, some cases of Crohn's disease are responsive to treatment with antibiotics. The E. coli strain LF82 that has increasingly been associated with Crohn's disease is unusual because it adheres to and invades intestinal epithelial cells in culture68 and has been shown to replicate within the phagolysosomes of macrophages in the granulomatous lesions69 instead of being cleared by the adaptive immune system. There is evidence that the adhesive and invasive E. coli associated with HUC are taken up by endosomes and persist in the macrophages instead of being cleared.65 These findings support the hypothesis that genetics play a major role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, and has led to recent genome-wide association studies in canine HUC. Certain defects in pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system have long been known to be associated with the development of Crohn's disease.70 These receptors are important for the interaction of the mucosal innate immune system with the microflora of the intestinal lumen. The default response of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue is to clear offending pathogens, but to tolerate commensal organisms from the intestinal lumen.71 Recent evidence confirms that polymorphisms in certain PRRs, such as NOD2, result in a disturbed response of human monocytes to E. coli LF82, linking genetics with functional disease for the first time.72 Preliminary results from genetic studies in Boxers with HUC and healthy controls point to a defect in a protein in neutrophils that leads to defective clearance in E. coli in macrophages.",

It is therefore possible that similar defects in PRRs occur in people with IBD and in dogs with HUC. A genetic predisposition for HUC is suspected due to the preponderance of cases in young boxer dogs. In the first report of the disease in 1965, most of the affected dogs could be traced to a single ancestor.53 Confirmation and identification of mutations in PRRs such as TLRs or NODs in boxers with HUC is still lacking. However, it seems likely that a defect in innate immunity renders dogs with HUC more susceptible to infections with specific bacteria, such as the adhesive and invasive E. coli strains described previously (Figure 58-8\n).",

            "text": "The diagnostic approach to cases with HUC is as described for chronic colitis. Typically, colonoscopy reveals sites of severe colonic hemorrhage and ulceration interspersed with stretches of normal appearing mucosa (Figure 58-9\n). Ten to 15 biopsies should be taken for histopathological analysis. Early lesions can consist of a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, subjacent to degenerative epithelium.53, 55, 73, 74 With more extensive lesions and chronic disease, the ulcers become more visible on histology with severe infiltration of the lamina propria and the submucosal regions with neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and mast cells. There is also usually marked loss of the epithelial surface in biopsies from lesions and loss of goblet cells in the entire colon. Accumulation of large PAS-positive macrophages is pathognomonic for HUC54, 73, 75 and remains the best way to confirm the diagnosis (Figure 58-10\n). In immunohistochemical studies HUC lesions are characterized by an increased number of L1-positive cells (Figure 58-11\n), as well as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-positive cells, CD3-positive cells, and IgG-positive plasma cells.60 L1 is a cytosolic calcium-binding protein, the function of which has not been described in detail in the dog. In humans, it is expressed by macrophages and neutrophils at an early stage in their differentiation and is lost when macrophages migrate into tissues and mature. It is possible that in canine HUC recently emigrated blood monocytes progressively differentiate into tissue macrophages, and become eventually filled with PAS-positive material, while L1 expression is downregulated.55 MHC class II molecules are normally present on macrophages. Therefore it is not surprising to find an increased MHC class II expression associated with PAS-positive macrophages in HUC. Increased T-cell numbers were observed in HUC and are reminiscent of increased numbers of CD3-positive cells seen in other forms of canine IBD, particularly lymphoplasmacytic IBD.60 Confirmation of the presence of E. coli using FISH analysis on formalin-fixed biopsies is now recommended as part of the detailed diagnostic work-up for dogs with suspected HUC.75a Up to 43% of dogs with HUC develop enrofloxacin resistance early in the disease process and may be refractory to treatment if they are treated without taking bacterial culture results into account.75b\n",

Management of HUC used to consist of various combinations of dietary modification (e.g., increasing fiber content and specific elimination diets), and antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment with sulfasalazine, prednisone, and azathioprine, as described previously for the treatment of chronic colitis. Typically these strategies were not successful, and most cases had to be euthanized because of refractoriness to treatment. In recent years two reports have sparked hope for treatment of HUC: a total of 35 cases have been described and have shown a dramatic response to treatment with enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO once daily), or a combination protocol with enrofloxacin, amoxicillin (20 mg/kg PO twice daily), and metronidazole (10 to 15 mg/kg PO twice daily).56 Reports of the disease almost 30 years ago also occasionally described a good response to treatment with antibiotics, namely chloramphenicol and tetracycline.76 The response to treatment with enrofloxacin in the more recent reports was dramatic, with all dogs responding within 3 to 12 days of initiating therapy. It is particularly encouraging that several dogs were reportedly disease-free after the drug had been discontinued following a 4- to 6-week course of treatment.56\n",

Clinical signs include a painful ulcerated perineal region that may cause tenesmus, hematochezia, and even anorexia and weight loss. Histologic evidence of colitis has been documented in several cases of AF.78, 79 This association is interesting because chronic fistulation is frequently observed in people with Crohn disease. Moreover, PRRs are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD in people and dogs, and have been the object of recent research in dogs with AF. One study found dysfunctional NOD2 responses in German Shepherd dogs with AF.80 Moreover, a restricted allelic variation in TLR1, TLR5, and TLR6 was found in German Shepherd dogs. However, there were no significant associations between these PRR polymorphisms and AF. Nevertheless, these polymorphisms may influence innate immune responses in German Shepherd dogs and may be an important predisposing factor for the development of AF in that breed.81 In other studies, increased prevalence of a specific haplotype of alleles of genes encoding class II molecules of the canine MHC was shown in German Shepherd dogs with AF, suggesting a possible defect in antigen presentation associated with the disease.82 Finally, it is noteworthy that feeding a restricted antigen diet maintained more than 80% of dogs with AF in complete remission after en bloc surgical excision and anal sacculectomy,83 and that both AF and IBD respond to treatment of immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone and cyclosporine.84 These similarities underline the possibility of a comparable pathomechanism for both diseases.",

Despite these clinical signs, most cats maintain good health, and normal appetite and body condition.",

The sensitivity of direct fecal smear examination for diagnosis of T. foetus is low (2% in cats with experimentally induced infection and 14% in cats with spontaneous disease). T. foetus trophozoites are often misdiagnosed as Giardia and can be difficult to distinguish from nonpathogenic trichomonads such as Pentatrichomonas hominis. If repeated direct microscopic examination results are negative for T. foetus, feces may be cultured in commercially available pouches marketed for diagnosis of T. foetus infection in cattle (In Pouch TF, Biomed Diagnostics, White City, OR). Neither Giardia spp. nor P. hominis organisms survived in In Pouch TF for longer than 24 hours in one study; consequently, positive cultures are strongly suggestive of T. foetus infection.30 A sensitive and specific single-tube nested PCR based on amplification of a conserved portion of the T. foetus ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene unit from feline feces is commercially available (http://www.JodyGookin.com). Nested PCR assays are believed to be superior to fecal culture for diagnosis of infected cats.31 Histopathology should not be relied upon to make a diagnosis of T. foetus infection, although a diagnosis can be attained if organisms are identified.29\n",

Subsequent access of CPE to the basolateral epithelium induces structural damage to intercellular tight junctions resulting in increased epithelial permeability.73 When administered orally or directly into the intestinal lumen of dogs, CPE induces fluid secretion and diarrhea.74 CPE is one of numerous polypeptide enterotoxins that may be produced by C. perfringens.

The intussusceptum is the invaginated segment of the alimentary tract, whereas the intussuscipiens is the enveloping segment. Invagination may occur in an antegrade (aborad) or retrograde (orad) direction, but is most commonly in the antegrade direction. Any portion of the alimentary tract may be involved, but enterocolic intussusceptions account for almost two-thirds of the published cases in dogs and cats. Enterocolic intussusceptions can be further divided into three types: cecocolic (or cecal inversion), with the inverted cecum forming the apex1; ileocolic, with the ileum forming the apex; and ileocecal, with the ileocecal junction forming the apex.2 Of these three forms of enterocolic intussusception, the ileocolic intussusception is the one most frequently encountered in clinical practice. A number of conditions are reported to predispose to intussusception, including intestinal parasitism, viral enteritis, foreign bodies, and masses, but in dogs and cats most intussusceptions are idiopathic.3, 4, 5\n",

Once the invagination has begun, its progress may be rapid, involving as much as several centimeters of intestinal tract within just a few hours. Invagination and intussusception result in luminal obstruction, which may be partial or complete. Obstruction usually results in distention of the bowel segment proximal to the intussusception. The degree of distention is dependent upon the completeness and duration of the obstruction, volume of fluid secretion, degree of vascular compromise, and volume of gas production from bacterial fermentation. Because the mesentery and blood supply are included in the invaginating segment, vascular compromise can occur, which initially leads to intramural hemorrhage and edema and eventually to ischemia and necrosis of the bowel. Full-thickness necrosis may ensue but perforations are rare.",

Pythium induces a chronic pyogranulomatous response in the gastrointestinal tract and mesenteric lymph nodes. The gastric outflow tract and ileocolonic junction are the most frequently affected portions of the GI tract, and it is not uncommon to find two or more segmental lesions in the same patient.17 Inflammation in affected regions is typically centered on the submucosa, with variable mucosal ulceration and occasional extension of disease through serosal surfaces, resulting in adhesion formation and peritonitis.",

In a survey of 156 cats with disseminated FIP, 26 had solitary mural intestinal lesions.24 Predominant clinical signs included diarrhea and vomiting for 3 months or less before intestinal biopsy. All cats had a mass, believed to be a neoplasm, in the colon or ileocecocolic junction. Affected intestine was markedly thickened, nodular, firm, and white, with multifocal pyogranulomas extending throughout the wall of the intestine, and the regional lymph nodes were uniformly involved.

A review of published cases suggests that 96% of cases of obstipation are accounted for by idiopathic megacolon (62%), pelvic canal stenosis (23%), nerve injury (6%), or Manx sacral spinal cord deformity (5%).1, 2 A smaller number of cases are accounted for by complications of colopexy (1%) and colonic neoplasia (1%); colonic hypo- or aganglionosis was suspected, but not proved, in another 2% of cases. A definitive case of colonic hypoganglionosis was reported in an 11-week-old female domestic short-haired cat.3 Inflammatory, pharmacologic, and environmental/behavioral causes were not cited as predisposing factors in any of the original case reports. Endocrine factors (e.g., obesity and hypothyroidism) were cited in several cases, but were not necessarily impugned as part of the pathogenesis of megacolon.

Prolonged inability to defecate may result in other systemic signs, including anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, and vomiting.",

Colonic impaction may be so severe in such cases as to render it difficult to differentiate impaction from colonic, mesenteric, or other abdominal neoplasia. Cats with constipation caused by dysautonomia may have other signs of autonomic nervous system failure, such as urinary and fecal incontinence, regurgitation as a consequence of megaesophagus, mydriasis, decreased lacrimation, prolapse of the nictitating membrane, and bradycardia. Digital rectal examination should be carefully performed with sedation or anesthesia in all cats. Pelvic fracture malunion may be detected on rectal examination in cats with pelvic trauma. Rectal examination might also identify other unusual causes of constipation, such as foreign bodies, rectal diverticula, stricture, inflammation, or neoplasia. Chronic tenesmus may be associated with perineal herniation in some cases. A complete neurologic examination with special emphasis on caudal spinal cord function should be performed to identify neurologic causes of constipation, for example, spinal cord injury, pelvic nerve trauma, or Manx sacral spinal cord deformity.",

            "text": "Subtotal colectomy is an effective treatment for feline idiopathic megacolon or megacolon secondary to the mechanical obstruction created by old, healed pelvic fractures. Recommendations for removal of the ileocolic valve and ileum vary in cats with megacolon. The ileocolic blood vessels tether the distal ileum and proximal ascending colon, preventing anastomosis to the distal colon; thus if a complete colectomy is performed, these vessels must be sacrificed. This necessitates removing the ileum, which has important normal functions in water, vitamin B12, and bile salt resorption, and performing a jejunocolic anastomosis. In spite of this concern, postoperative intestinal function was normal in four cats evaluated after subtotal colectomy and jejunocolic anastomosis.43, 47 The ileocolic valve also minimizes colonic bacterial access to the small intestine,44 so preservation of the valve would be ideal to minimize small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and deconjugation of bile salts. However, preservation of the ileocolic junction necessitates leaving several centimeters of the ascending colon to ensure a tension-free anastomosis, possibly predisposing these cats to recurrent constipation. To evaluate these concerns, cats with megacolon treated with colectomy were studied retrospectively. Cats with excision of the ileocolic junction had significantly looser stool on long-term followup.43 However there was no difference in the incidence of constipation between cats with preservation versus excision of the ileocolic junction.48 This is perhaps explained by in vitro experiments with ascending and descending colonic smooth muscle from cats with clinical megacolon showing that smooth muscle dysfunction is less severe in the ascending colon.8\n",

Direct and indirect costs of IBS reach up to $30 billion per year in the United States alone.49 IBS is commonly subdivided into different phenotypes depending upon the most prevalent bowel habit: diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), and mixed features IBS (IBS-M).50 Because of the inability of animal species to describe clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain and discomfort, IBS is not a very-well-defined syndrome in veterinary medicine. Nonetheless, recurring vomiting and diarrheal disorders are seen in companion animal species that are unaccompanied by mucosal morphologic change, and are presumed therefore to be of functional or physiological origin.51 The reader is referred to Chapter 41 for a more detailed discussion of IBS and its management.",

Radiographic contrast material more precisely outlines the narrowing of the lumen at the site of the tumor. Although still of some clinical utility, contrast studies have been largely superseded by ultrasonography and other imaging modalities. Ultrasonography is presently considered to be the most effective means of diagnosing colonic tumors in dogs and cats and appears to be useful in evaluating mural lesions and associated abdominal changes such as lymphadenopathy (Figure 58-16\n).33 Ultrasonography was reported to be useful 84% of the time in localizing feline colonic neoplasia in one study.16 Ultrasonographic features of colonic tumors include transmural wall thickening with complete loss of the normal wall layering, fluid accumulation proximal to the lesion, and reduced regional motility.33 Transabdominal fine-needle aspiration, peritoneal fluid cytology, and endoscopic exfoliative cytology may be useful in the diagnosis of lymphoma, but histopathology is generally required for a definitive diagnosis of other colonic neoplasia.

In an experimental study on healthy dogs, both transection alone and resection of 4 cm of rectum via a dorsal approach resulted in fecally continent dogs. Resection of 6 cm of the rectum, including the peritoneal reflection, caused fecal incontinence.42 This limitation on resection is problematic in animals with larger rectal tumors, as a 2-cm gross margin is recommended on both sides of the tumor.39, 44, 45\n",

Colonic ulcer is not a frequent complication of either intervertebral disk disease or corticosteroid therapy. In the initial report of the condition, colonic perforation was described in two dogs out of \u201cseveral thousand.\u201d1 Ten additional cases were subsequently reported until 1986,2, 3, 4 and since then no additional reports have been published. This may represent increased awareness of the condition, reluctance to publish on a previously described condition, or perhaps a shift away from the use of dexamethasone in dogs with intervertebral disk disease. Colonic perforation is infrequent in humans treated with corticosteroids for neurologic disease5 but may occur more commonly when dexamethasone is used.6 In nonneurologic conditions, the frequency of perforation is influenced by the underlying disease and the presence of a diverticulum in the sigmoid colon.7 Why this lesion develops in some dogs but not others is not readily explained.",

In addition, glucocorticoids inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelial cells,9 perhaps further affecting colonic blood supply.10 Together, these factors coalesce to induce erosion of the colonic mucosa, colonic perforation, and peritonitis.3 The relationship between intervertebral disk disease, corticosteroid treatment, and colonic perforation is highlighted by a report describing 29 dogs with gastrointestinal perforation associated with administration of a COX-2 inhibitor. None of the latter dogs were treated for intervertebral disk disease, and none of the perforations were in the colon.11\n",

The pathognomonic lesion of this disease is a mucosal infiltration with large numbers of macrophages staining positively with PAS, and accompanied by mucosal ulceration and loss of goblet cells.14 Although the term histiocytic ulcerative colitis describes many features of the disease, it understates the mixed lymphocytic plasmacytic component of the inflammation, and the term granulomatous colitis has been adopted to more completely characterize the histopathology. For the most part, the disease is localized to the large intestine and regional lymph nodes; however, in some instances PAS-positive macrophages may be found in lymph nodes remote from the intestine, suggesting that there is limited systemic distribution of the disease. Historically, an infectious etiology had been speculated but never proved. At least two independent lines of investigation now point to an adherent and invasive E. coli as the underlying etiology of granulomatous colitis.14, 15 The pathophysiology, clinical examination, diagnosis, and therapy of granulomatous colitis of Boxer dogs and other breeds are discussed in the \u201cInflammation\u201d section.",

            "text": "Figure 58-7: Proposed mechanism of oral tolerance against commensal organisms and pathogenesis of IBD. A, The pathogenesis of IBD involves three factors: the mucosal barrier, including an intact epithelial cell lining; the host immune system consisting of innate immunity and adaptive immunity; and microbes and food antigens in the intestinal lumen. The interplay of these three factors is important to maintain intestinal homeostasis. In the normal case scenario, antigen-presenting cells continuously sample antigens from the intestinal lumen through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Depending on the nature of these antigens, the signals elicited by the antigen-presenting cells drive the adaptive immune response in the appropriate direction to eradicate a pathogen. For example, in the case of a parasite, naive T cells are preferentially driven to differentiate into T-helper (Th) 2 cells that recruit eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells to kill the parasites. In the case of a pathogenic virus, the naive T cells preferentially differentiate into Th1 cells that produce cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3. These cytokines recruit macrophages that phagocytose and kill intracellular viruses. In the case of pathogenic bacteria being recognized, naive T cells preferentially differentiate into Th17 cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22. This recruits T cells and neutrophils to kill extracellular bacteria. In the case of commensal bacteria being recognized through PRRs, naive T cells preferentially differentiate into T-regulatory cells that counteract the effect of proinflammatory cytokines produced by Th17 cells. B, In the case of IBD, a primary defect in the recognition of commensals or certain pathogens by innate immune receptors may play a causative role. Mutations in PRRs lead to misrepresentation of commensals as pathogens, leading to the massive production of IL-23, driving naive T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells. These Th17 cells then produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This leads to tissue destruction and epithelial cell injury, letting even more antigens pass through to the lamina propria. This inflammatory response cannot be counterregulated by regulatory T cells, leading to the characteristic inflammatory pattern seen in IBD.",

To prevent infection, the innate immune system activates adaptive immune processes by promoting proinflammatory cytokine expression of T cells, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and interleukin (IL)-17. This results in appropriate expansion of the relevant T cells to clear the infection, such as T-helper (Th) 1 cells for viruses and Th2 cells for parasites. In the case of normal commensals and adhesive\u2013invasive E. coli (AIEC) in an animal not affected by HUC, T-regulatory cells will produce antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, which leads to suppression of an inflammatory adaptive immune response and tolerance toward these bacteria. B, Hypothetical explanation for the pathogenesis of HUC. Mutations in pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLRs, lead to inappropriate activation of the adaptive immune system. In the case of AIEC, there is no expansion of T-regulatory cells, which results in engorgement of macrophages with AIEC within their lysosomes. The colonic lamina propria in dogs with HUC is filled with macrophages which stain positive for intracellular AIEC.",
