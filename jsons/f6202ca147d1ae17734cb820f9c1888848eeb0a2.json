Probability of outbreak is defined by monitoring the number of people in the E, A, and I classes and an outbreak is declared when the cumulative size of these compartments reaches the threshold value of 50. Although the value of 50 appears relatively large, it is reasonable given that we are counting the cumulative number in all three classes for a relatively large population size of 2000. For these simulations, we vary \u03b2 2 given the significant effect of this parameter on the model outputs as confirmed by the LHS analysis. We note a negative correlation between the proportion of SS in the S class and the probability of outbreak (Fig. 4) and attribute this to the fact that the value of \u03b2 2 is varied in order to maintain a constant value of R 0 (MERS, R 0 = 2.5 and Ebola, R 0 = 2.39).

As the fraction of initially infected SS individuals increases beyond 0.005 for MERS (Fig. 6b) and 0.0075 for Ebola (Fig. 6d) , we find that the simulation always gives rise to an outbreak, resulting in a maximal number of around 1000 deaths over a 150-day simulated period. We also note that there is a decrease in the variability in the number of deaths when the outbreak is initiated by an SS rather than an NS, which contributes to this threshold response. The seemingly binary response in the number of deaths resulting from a MERS or Ebola epidemic initiated by infected SS individuals who only contribute to 0.5-0.75% of the starting population is a good indication that by tracking the number of deaths in an epidemic, the presence of an SS may be predicted.

From a public health perspective, as SS events will be observed more frequently, intervention/prevention methods must have rapid response to reduce disease severity. For example, Wong et al. [40] suggested that several community-based efforts could have been made to reduce the number of MERS and Ebola cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone, such as tracking contacts, earlier diagnosis, treatment strategies, and community education. Effective responses to control superspreading events and reduce disease transmission in MERS and Ebola outbreaks included: \"early discovery, diagnosis, intervention, and quarantine of confirmed cases.\" [40] . Other epidemics that are more likely to occur in hospital settings, e.g., SARS, could be controlled through hospital administrative strategies, such as reducing contact between the infected patient and healthcare workers, visitors, or other patients whose immune system may be comprised due to other infections [32] .
