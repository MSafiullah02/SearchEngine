Currently, N200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) in the atmosphere. The decline initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China's energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution. The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment. These findings can provide a reference for other countries to assess the influence of COVID-19 on the environment.",

On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 has constituted a \"global pandemic\" and called for an aggressive global response. According to statistics, as of April 16, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 1.99 million, and N200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic (World Health Organization, 2020c) . The global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 not only seriously threatens public health (Bai et al., 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020) , but also greatly hinders global economic growth (Lai et al., 2020) . Gita Gopinath from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed out that due to the impact of the COVID-19, the global economy would experience a recession in 2020, and the economic growth rate would drop to \u22123% (Gopinath, 2020) . This result is 6.3% lower than the forecast in the World Economic Outlook released by the IMF in January 2020. The COVID-19 is considered to negatively affect the world economy due to two main reasons. First, the rapid spread of the epidemic worldwide has directly led to a sharp increase in the uncertainty of economic development, which has triggered turbulence in financial and capital markets (McKibbin and Fernando, 2020) . Secondly, in order to control the spread of the epidemic, countries have strictly restricted the movement of people and transportation, and economic activities have been greatly reduced (Fernandes, 2020) , which puts pressure on economic operations from both consumption and production sides. Many scholars forecast that the effect of the COVID-19 on the economy will outweigh that of the 2008 financial crisis.",

From January 16 to 24, the number of confirmed cases per day increased rapidly. This may be related to Chinese New Year.

From February 5th to 11th, the number of confirmed cases per day has decreased, indicating that the quarantine measures are effective in suppressing the spread of the virus. Moreover, China extended the Spring Festival holiday, which results in the population mobility during the Spring Festival in 2020 being much lower than that during the Spring Festival in 2019 (Hu, 2019) . After February 12, the number of daily confirmed cases gradually declined and eased.

Many cities closed train stations to prevent people from entering the city unless they are proved live or work there. In the countryside, villages are separated by vehicles, tents and other temporary barriers. In terms of economy, a large number of enterprises stopped production.

Observing changes in the content of NO 2 in the atmosphere can accurately capture the improvement in air quality (NASA Earth Observatory, 2016) . The monitoring results show that the COVID-19 seriously threatens public health, but its short-term contribution to reducing emissions is significant. This is because China adopted strict restrictions when fighting against the COVID-19, with the entire country shutting down. These restrictions not only slowed down domestic economic growth, but also effectively reduced GHG emissions. But this decline is only short-term, and in the long run, a rebound is inevitable. Hence, how to take into account the environment protection while restoring the economy is an issue that policymakers should fully consider when making decisions.",

The main conclusions of this paper are as follows. (1) The outbreak of COVID-19 improved China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributed to global carbon emissions reduction. From the time dimension, China's energy consumption dropped sharply during the outbreak of COVID-19, especially the total coal consumption. And COVID-19 effectively suppressed the GHG emissions such as CO 2 . However, the observed data indicate that this beneficial effect only occurs during quarantine. As some regions in China lifted the lockdown and enterprises resumed production, people and goods began to flow on a large scale. Meanwhile, declining energy consumption is showing an upward trend, and traffic congestion is gradually returning to the level before quarantine. It can be deduced from this that when China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes production, its energy use and GHG emissions are likely to exceed the level before the outbreak.",
