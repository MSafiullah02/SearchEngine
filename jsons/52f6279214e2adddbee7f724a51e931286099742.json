Human capital gets eroded due to HIV/AIDS discuss Putnam's use of the term social capital. Since sexually transmitted diseases result from social interactions, any relation between social capital and such diseases are of interest. It is important to note that social capital is different from human capital as well as physical capital. Table 4 .2 shows that, for a developed country, poverty is not correlated with HIV, gonorrhea or syphilis. Income inequality, on the other hand, is correlated with HIV. However, social capital is strongly correlated with all four diseases. David (2007) undertook a more ambitious study of the relationship between HIV/AIDS and social capital, at the international level. Using data from 80 countries around the world, and using the World Value Survey at the national level for each country as a proxy for social capital, he finds that, under most specifications, HIV/AIDS is related to social capital. His interpretation of the data was to claim that HIV/AIDS causes a decline in social capital at the national level. However, given that his data is cross-sectional, there is no way of proving the causality he claims. We can just as easily envision a decline of social capital leading to an increase in HIV/AIDS. There is a significant negative correlation between social capital and income inequality, on the one hand, and HIV/AIDS, on the other hand. However, it is not clear what policy prescription should flow from these findings. Changing income inequality in a country is not a simple matter. It involves social engineering on a large scale. A policy of reducing income inequality by taxation and redistribution of wealth can backfire because it can negatively affect individual incentives. Policies to increase social capital are even less obvious.",

Therefore, the long-term economic impact of HIV/AIDS is very different from the short-term impact. Moreover, in any given economy, there are many evolving variables affecting the economy at the same time. Therefore, we use economic modeling to isolate the economic effect of one variable (HIV/AIDS). We first use a standard one-sector macroeconomic model as a framework for exploring the macroeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS. The total output (Y) is a function of capital (K) and labor (L): Y = F(K, L). Y is assumed to be an increasing function in both K and L. In addition, we make a distinction between labor (or workforce) (L) and the population (N). Thus, we can express the production function in per capita terms as Y/N = F(K, L)/N. Under the assumption that F is a homogeneous function of degree one, we can write the equation as Y/N = F(K/N, L/N). Growth theory tells us that output per capita (Y/N) will rise or fall depending on capital per capita (K/L) and labor per capita or the labor participation rate (L/N). Economic growth comes from three different sources in this model: (1) a higher labor participation rate (rising L/N); (2) a higher capital labor ratio (K/N); and (3) technology (that causes the function F to shift upwards). 115 in hand. Thus, a high incidence of absolute poverty might cause a high incidence of HIV/AIDS. To put it differently, it is impossible to tell whether absolute poverty causes HIV/AIDS or vice versa -or whether another variable, such as war, inadequate health or poor education, explains the relationship.",

Bloom and Mahal (2001) have also noted relationships between poverty and income inequality and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. However, in terms of policy implications, such studies do not offer much in the way of concrete proposals. Poverty reduction is too broad a goal to constitute what might be termed an HIV/AIDS prevention strategy.

If HIV/AIDS reduces the labor force (L) more than the entire population (N), then the labor participation rate (L/N) would fall. However, a decline in the supply of labor would lead to a rise in capital per labor unit (K/L) in the short run. Thus, in the short run, the total impact of HIV/AIDS is ambiguous in this model.

It turned out that the expansion of HIV/AIDS was far more severe in many countries than were addressed in the model. The scale of the rise in mortality had not reached the proportions that were to be reached over the next decade. Hence, the macroeconomic impact that did not appear in their study was to show up in later studies (see below). Bloom and Mahal also compared the current and forthcoming impact of HIV/AIDS with that of the Black Death in the 1300s. They argued that evidence shows that the Black Death actually caused an increase in the standard of living among the survivors. However, the same argument would not apply to HIV/AIDS today. In the 1300s, the main source income was agriculture that had very little input of human capital. Education hardly played any role in the (mostly agricultural) production process. Even the actual sowing season was not known with precision. Today, the agricultural production process is vastly different. Almost everywhere in the world, the use of artificial fertilizer and pesticides is commonplace. Thus, even in agriculture, human capital has become a factor in the production process. This was not relevant in the 14 th century. Therefore, it is critical to take into account in the model the impact of HIV/AIDS on human capital.",

If the worker dies, his or her skills and experience are destroyed. (b) Firms and the government lose trained workers on both counts and must replace them. In particular, many teachers die prematurely of AIDS. (c) Substantial expenditure, public and private alike, may be required to treat and care for those who become sick. (d) Savings are also diverted out of net investment in physical and human capital into the treatment and replacement of workers who fall sick and die.

In the absence of support or compulsion, the offspring of these unions will also go uneducated, and so on. Observe that any premature adult mortality will produce a new crop of orphaned children in each period and that these lineages will fall into poverty and illiteracy, even if they were not in that condition before. Hence, as time progresses, a steadily increasing proportion of the whole population finds itself in poverty. Caring for orphans is not, of course, a new problem for humankind, and societies have devised various ways of dealing with it. Whether these arrangements can withstand the burden of an epidemic like AIDS, however, remains to be seen. After calibrating the model to South African parameters, Bell, Devarajan and Gersbach proceed to work out the dynamics of the evolution of family income in the model under three scenarios. First, they calculate it for the case of \"No AIDS\". Then, they contrast it with two possible scenarios with different levels of human capital investment. In \"AIDS (L)\" case, they assume that human capital investment would taper off rapidly. In \"AIDS (H)\" case, they assume that human capital investment would taper off relatively slowly. These results are depicted in Figure 4 .5. Had there been no AIDS, the family income in real terms would have increased almost fivefold between 1960 and 2080. In the worst case scenario of AIDS (L), the family income declines by 40% by 2080.

How strong are these effects? Kalemli-Ozcan notes the following: \"The empirical estimates predict that parents in a country with a high level of HIV/AIDS prevalence, such as Congo, have two more children compared to a country with a low level of HIV/AIDS prevalence, such as Madagascar. Botswana had a quadrupling of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. It has had 1.5 more births per woman and 30% points lower primary school enrollment since 1985.

(2007) followed up on Kalemli-Ozcan (2006) by examining directly the fertility response to HIV/AIDS. They used the latest rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys linking an individual woman's fertility to her HIVstatus based on testing. The data allows us to distinguish the effect of positive HIV status on fertility (which may be due to lower fecundity and other physiological reasons) from the behavioral response to higher mortality risk (measured by the local community's HIV prevalence).

For example, does the threat of HIV lead to less sex without condoms? What factors affect the behavior of people when they know about the risk of HIV/AIDS, given that there is no cure? Does the introduction of ARV drugs lead people to have more risky sex? Is it possible to set out policies that are aligned to the incentives of people to undertake activities to limit the propagation of HIV/ AIDS? Answers to such behavioral questions are important. For example, the ABC policy (A for abstinence B for be faithful and C for condom), which is favored by the Bush Administration and implemented by PEPFAR in countries in Africa with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, emphasizes A and B and relies heavily on the behavioral response. The Ugandan government has been using a three-pronged strategy: Abstinence (efforts to raise the age of sexual debut by young adults), Be Faithful (efforts to discourage more than one sexual partner) and Condom (efforts to increase the use of condoms) -the so-called ABC approach. The \"success\" of Uganda's ABC program attracted the attention of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2001. It convened a group of policymakers from academia, various government bodies, such as the CDC, along with various charitable American organizations working in Africa. The point of this meeting was to hammer out the importance of different components of ABC.",

The new Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief that President Bush announced in January in the State of the Union Address is based on one of these successful models\" (Peterson 2003). One of the strongest ABC proponents was Dorothy Brewster Lee of Christian Connections for International Health. She noted that, in Cameroon, where faithbased organizations were marginalized because they would not support condoms, HIV infections among pregnant women continued to increase. She emphasized that interventions that have proven effective in Europe and North America should not be applied in African settings without consideration for indigenous culture, including views on recreational or casual sex. She noted that many African countries have higher rates than the United States of under-15-year-olds who have not had sex. She also argued that HIV prevention approaches have generally failed to provide fair and balanced recognition to abstinence and faithfulness. Instead, the reports and strategies of UNAIDS and other international organizations gave condoms much more attention and emphasis (USAID 2002) .",

However, what was not clear at the time was that US policy would have, in turn, a big impact on the future course of Ugandan policy. Once the US government began spending large sums of money in Uganda, rewarding it as the role model, the official policy in Uganda changed considerably. It began to emphasize A and B and to downplay C, just as Dorothy Brewster Lee had proposed. Thus, we could characterize the new policy as ABc, rather than ABC, in which all three elements had played prominent roles. 130 In November 2004, Uganda claimed to have become the first country in the world to draft an official national policy on abstinence and fidelity. Titled the \"Uganda National Abstinence and Being Faithful Policy and Strategy on Prevention of Transmission on HIV,\" the draft policy is described by its authors as a companion to the country's existing strategy on the promotion of condoms and a component of Uganda's larger \"ABC\" strategy. One of the coauthors of this strategy document (Edward Green) was also a founding member of PEPFAR (Kyomuhendo Gray (2005) noted a clear change in the Ugandan government position with respect to condom promotion. The government of Uganda has adopted an official stance that discourages condom promotion, for the following reasons: \"(1) Conmessages may confuse youth.

He estimated that 62% of men and 30% of women in the main road trading centers had more than two sexual partners in the previous 5 years. Men were more likely to be seropositive if they lived in trading centers or villages. Compared with the rest of the population, men had three to five times more risk of being seropositive. Given the evidence, Klitsch deduced that \"HIV transmission follows trade routes, and is probably linked to commercial sex.

She illustrates the theory Fig. 4 .18, which shows death rates for Egypt over the 1990s and Botswana in 2001 for different age groups. She argues that the pattern of death rates over the life cycle for Egypt is similar to Botswana, as expected for a country in its income level. Specifically, mortality is high in infancy and childhood, then low through the age of 40 and increasing after that -the typical U-shape we expect. In contrast, the pattern for Botswana produces a W shape, signaling significant AIDS mortality. Although death rates are similar to Egypt up to age 19, they are much higher after that, until late adulthood. This mortality pattern clearly reflects AIDS deaths, as virtually no other disease had this mortality path over the life cycle during the period of study. Thus, unlike the researchers who have been changes can be explained by changes in exports. This research confirmed the relationship between trade and the propagation of HIV that had been observed by other researchers, like Klitsch and Steinbrook. Oster (2007b) wanted to relate new infections (incidence of HIV) with changing export values. Unfortunately, the incidence of HIV is rarely recorded in developing countries. If a person discovers that she has HIV in 1990, this does not mean she contracted it that year. Oster devised an indirect method. She argued Using this method, she recalculated the incidence and the corresponding prevalence in Oster (2006) . In that paper, she correctly anticipated the overestimated HIV/AIDS prevalence that the UNAIDS acknowledged a year later (see Chap. 3 for a fuller discussion of this issue). Oster (2007b) proceeds to build a model of the HIV epidemic, making explicit how HIV and economic activity may be linked. For the model, she notes: \"The model builds on three observations. First, truck drivers and other migrants (i.e., those who spend time living or traveling away from home) tend to have more sexual partners than the average person. Second, the sexual partnerships these people have away from home tend to be higher risk than those they have at home, largely interested in the effect of HIV on mortality patterns, Oster is working the impact in reverse.

            "text": "Many researchers are concerned with how much it would cost to scale up prevention and treatment programs. For example, Stover et al. (2006) estimate that if an investment of USD 122 billion is made before 2015, in 125 low-and middleincome countries, targeted at sexual transmission and transmission among injection drug users, it would avert 28 million new infections. They estimate the cost at about USD 3900 to prevent each new infection, but that this would save USD 4700 in foregone treatment and care costs per person, thus justifying the cost. Similarly, interventions in other forms have been investigated. The World Bank (2006) provided a comparison of various types of interventions. We report this in Table 4 .6. It gives us a unique perspective on different types of interventions. For example, we find that by far the most cost effective interventions are achieved through sex workers and the management of sexually transmitted infections. Given our discussions about how trade routes and sex workers provided a potent combination for expanding the disease and that there is high correlation between different sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, these results should not be surprising. Surprisingly, mother-to-child transmission intervention turns out to be very expensive in India. This is not a universal finding (see Chap. 9). 140 Data from India also provides another insight into the cost effectiveness of the scale of operation of HIV/AIDS projects. A study by Guinness et al. (2007) examines data from HIV/AIDS projects targeted at commercial sex workers in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu -two large southern states of India -during the financial year 2001-2002. Figure 4 .20 illustrates their findings. It shows that costs go up as the coverage increases. The analysis of the data suggests a point of minimum efficient scale. This scale of operation is achieved when 1,500-2,000 persons are covered by the operation. and HIV in general also suggests specific avenues of HIV prevention. In particular, the implication that truckers and other migrants is a very important driver of the overall epidemic supports targeting prevention activities at that group (similar to the targeting done of prostitutes in Thailand). In addition, if increases in economic activity make the HIV epidemic worse, it suggests that aid groups aiming to increase growth should do so in collaboration with those seeking to decrease HIV.\" in the propagation of HIV/AIDS in high incidence countries. Thus, policies based on simple epidemiological models may fall short of desired effects if we ignore the economics of HIV/AIDS. Oster's research (2006 Oster's research ( , 2007a shows that economics plays a significant role The findings from this study have clear policy implications for the planned scaling up of HIV/AIDS programs around the world. If prevention and treatment are to be scaled up, what should be the optimum size for each center? This study provides an idea. However, as the authors note, the findings are far from universal. Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu show substantial differences. Thus, we would need to apply the results of this research with caution for other regions and other ",

The HIV prevalence rate among adults 15-49 years was 17%, an estimated 98,000 people died of AIDS, the number of children and adults (0-49 years) living with HIV was around 1.1 million and the number of AIDS orphans was estimated to be 710,000. Forty-six percent of the population was aged 0-15 years. The GDP of Zambia was USD 6.93 billion making the average per capita income around USD 600 in current dollars or USD 900 when adjusted for purchasing power parity.

If expenditure falls short of revenue, all it has to do is to increase the tax rate. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff. The higher the rate, the higher is the incentive to hide the income or to hive it off to a low tax regime country. Thus, beyond a certain rate, the revenue will not rise any further. Here we will consider two such tradeoffs. One is a tradeoff between the influx of foreign money to fight HIV/AIDS against the destabilizing effect on the exchange rate. The other is the tradeoff between using each marginal dollar to combat one disease or another. The question that arises is whether we can justify singling out HIV/AIDS for increased funding when the lives could be saved in other programs in a much more inexpensive fashion.

This episode and the subsequent bird flu outbreaks in different parts of the world prompted the Congressional Budget Office to produce a potential impact study.

HIV/AIDS destroys human capital and reduces that transmission of human capital between generations, leading to declining levels of education. The slow-moving nature of HIV/AIDS produces higher costs of treatment and palliative care than epidemics that kill quickly. These additional costs can decrease GDP growth by reducing savings and investment. On the individual level, HIV/AIDS can reduce income and increase costs.

As a result, the impact of HIV/AIDS on overall economic welfare, in the form of changes to GDP, remains unclear.

New shipping lines not only brought in goods faster; they also brought the plague to the rest of Europe. Thus, it is logical to see the spread of HIV/AIDS as a consequence of rising trade.
