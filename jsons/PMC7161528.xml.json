Although ACE2 mRNA is present in all organs, its protein expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells [6].

The ACE2 gene (which is located on X chromosome) is characterized by a large polymorphism, and significant associations between polymorphisms and occurrence of arterial hypertension have been reported for women of different race and ethnicity and in Han Chinese men [10,11]. More recently, the combination of ACE1 and ACE2 polymorphisms has been associated with susceptibility to hypertension in Brazilian patients [12]. Within the Chinese population, the polymorphism distribution seems different between regions; polymorphisms of ACE2 are associated with different blood pressure response to the cold pressor test. An enhanced response is associated with polymorphisms more frequently observed in northern regions of China, and lowered response with polymorphisms more frequently observed in southern regions. This observation leads the authors to speculate that this was a consequence of exposure to different climatic conditions, possibly because of adaptive selection over generations [10,13]. Furthermore, ACE2 polymorphism is correlated to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, septal wall thickness, ventricular hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease in Asian populations [14]. However, whether ACE2 polymorphism is associated with a different susceptibility to Covid-19 infection or its severity is still speculative.",

In animal models a 100-fold increase in ACE activity was observed after exposure to NO2, which also induces an increase in Angiotensin II binding to its receptor [15,16]. Of note, ACE2 expression is associated with Angiotensin II binding to type-1 receptor (AT1R). In human cardiofibroblasts Angiotensin II induces overexpression of both ACE2 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner, through regulatory factor(s) interacting with a regulatory sequence located at \u2212516/-481 of human ACE2 gene [17]. NO2 is a major air pollutant. Increased concentration exposure to NO2 was found to be associated to an increased risk of hypertension in a population-based, cross-sectional study including 15, 477 Chinese adults [18]. Furthermore, in the 2003 SARS epidemic, a positive association between air pollution (defined by the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ground-level ozone) and case fatality was observed in Chinese population [19]. Public opinion is currently impressed by the reported spectacular decrease in NO2 pollution worldwide, thanks to widespread lockdown measures. However, if we look at baseline data, NO2 pollution was remarkable in regions where COVID-19 epidemic is now particularly lethal: the cases of Lombardy for Italy, Paris and eastern France are markedly impressive [20].",

Although chronic lung damage induced by smoking would increase susceptibility to severe forms of viral pneumonia, available literature strongly suggests that nicotine upregulates the detrimental angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) but downregulates the compensatory ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137) receptor axis [21]. Thus, the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is either detrimental or provides a counterintuitive protective effect, warrants specific epidemiologic and clinical studies. A preliminary meta-analysis indicates that active smoking is not associated with severity of coronavirus disease [22].

In animal models, the loss of ACE2 resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase 2 activation, and administration of recombinant ACE2 was shown to inhibit the angiotensin II effects on TGF-\u03b21 activation and collagen production [14]. Recombinant ACE2 pulmonary overexpression attenuates whole aspects of pulmonary artery hypertension pathophysiology [23], suggesting that its loss of function (as could occur in case of massive binding by viral particles, with subsequent endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage [24]) could participate in the severity of respiratory distress. More importantly, loss of function of ACE2 cannot counterbalance the deleterious effects of Angiotensin II in promoting degradation of cardiac and lung structures and function [24]. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers could also potentially exert a protective action in the late phases of SARS COVID-19 by counteracting the negative effects of Angiotensin II.",

            "text": "Arterial hypertension medications: The urgent need of reflection should take into account the effect of medications on ACE2 synthesis, expression, and action whose theoretical impact on COVID-19 prevention, infection, severity, and management would be not negligible. Hypertension involves 1.39 billion people worldwide, 349 million in high-income and 1.04 billion in low- and middle-income countries. However, large discrepancies in exposure to antihypertensive drugs worldwide exist: the awareness, treatment, and control concern 67%, 56%, and 28% of patients in high income, and 37%, 29%, and 7.7% of patients in low- and middle-income countries [25]. Most patients with arterial hypertension and/or cardiac failure are treated by ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (sartans). Prescription of sartans increases each year in high-income countries, and are probably the most frequently prescribed drugs in diabetic patients with hypertension. These medications increase gene expression of ACE2 in rats [26]. Although there are no indications to date that the same situations occurs in humans, this could result in increased binding site for COVID-19 in non-infected cases and in the diffusion phases of viral infection, but, as stated above, could represent part of a therapeutic armamentarium in severely ill patients with compromised cardiorespiratory function. This therapeutic opportunity has been suggested by the march 19, 2020 joint statement of HFSA/ACC/AHA [27]. In this statement, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or sartans was discouraged for those patients currently prescribed, but the idea of updating these recommendations in the case of evolution in further research and developments was set. A warning signal on the possible impact of these drugs has been published in an authoritative journal [1].",

It should be emphasized that chloroquine has been advocated as a potentially effective drug to be administered in CIVID-19 associated pneumonia [28]. In vitro models showed that inhibitory effects are observed either before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages [29]. Chloroquine acts by elevating the endosomal pH, and interferes with terminal glycosylation of ACE2, thus negatively influencing the SARS virus-receptor binding as indicated in 2005 by in vitro studies [29]. In the early phase of infection with SARS-Cov-2, chloroquine could reduce the binding of the virus to ACE2 on alveolar lung cells membrane and possibly without interfering with ACE2 function. This would result in a reduction of direct viral cytotoxicity without unbalancing the complex equilibrium of the ACE system especially in the setting of ACE2 overexpression. Ongoing randomized trials will answer the question of usefulness of this medication.",

Ang II action is mediated by the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R). ACE, Ang II, and AT1R appears to promote lung injury. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) removes a single residue from Ang II to generate the vasodilator Ang-(1\u20137), counterbalancing the effects of Ang II. The main actions described for Ang-(1\u20137) are associated with Mas receptor activation. The ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas arm high activation is effective in reducing lung inflammation, fibrosis, and pulmonary artery hypertension. Scene 2: SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for entry into the cell, once the S protein has been primed by a serine protease. Scene 3: The expression of ACE2 and the balance of ANG II/ANG 1\u20137 influence the course of the disease. Accordingly, ACE 2 may be upregulated due to the individual polymorphism, NO2 associated with air pollution, and ACE inhibitors/Sartans. ACE2 affinity for spike protein may be lowered by hydroxy-chloroquine. Sartans may inhibit the deleterious effects of Ang II during the late phase of the infection.
