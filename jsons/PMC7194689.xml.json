In efforts to mitigate transmission and spread of the virus, social distancing, closure of public spaces, and quarantines have been implemented across the country. Despite the unfolding pandemic, other diseases require treatment, and will through what could be months of social distancing in the foreseeable future. Patients still require post-op care, emergency procedures, and surgical evaluations for time-sensitive new diagnoses. Telehealth may be able to help close the gap created by the pandemic and further our reach going forward. While surgery may not seem like it would lend itself to telehealth practices, multiple studies have shown it can be a viable modality for safe and effective surgical care as an alternative to in-office visits in the pre and post-operative periods.1, 2, 3\n",

Telehealth evaluations provide the unique advantage of allowing a local primary care physician or mid-level to consult the surgeon remotely, and perform a supervised physical exam.1\n,\n6 Furthermore, telehealth offers patients timely visits, often sooner than an in-person visit, and has high rates of satisfaction from patients and clinicians.1\n,\n5\n,\n6 Surgical subspecialties and oncologic resections lend themselves well to telehealth preoperative surgical evaluations, as demonstrated in a study by Cerfolio et al. published in June 2019, with 55 of 56 patients enrolled underwent thoracic oncology surgeries.5\n",
