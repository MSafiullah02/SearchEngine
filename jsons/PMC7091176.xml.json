Its genome is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved by host and viral proteases to produce ten mature viral proteins, including structural core protein, envelope proteins E1 and E2, the p7 ion channel protein, and nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B (Yin et al.2018). HCV infection causes acute and chronic hepatitis in humans with a high propensity for chronicity. A large number of HCV-infected patients fail to clear this virus and remain asymptomatic for years to develop severe liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Paboriboune et al.2018). The capability of establishing chronic infection by HCV is partly due to its ability to evade host innate immune responses (Horner and Gale 2013).",

RNAi serves as an important antiviral immune response in a wide range of organisms, including fungi, plants, and invertebrates (Guo et al.2019; Maillard et al.2019). Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that RNAi also exerts antiviral effects in mammals (Li et al.2013; Maillard et al.2013; Li et al.2016; Qiu et al.2017; Xu et al.2019). The antiviral RNAi is triggered by the viral replicative intermediate double-stranded RNAs (vRI-dsRNAs) produced in the course of viral replication. These vRI-dsRNAs can be recognized and cleaved by host endoribonuclease Dicer into virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) of approximately 21\u201323 nucleotide (nt). Argonaute (AGO) protein within RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) incorporates one of the strands of vsiRNA duplex, which directs the RISC-mediated degradation of cognate viral RNAs (Maillard et al.2019).",

One common strategy utilized by VSRs, including Nodamura virus (NoV) B2, Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35, influenza A virus (IAV) NS1, and human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) 3A, is to prevent viral dsRNA from cleavage by Dicer (Li et al.2004; Sullivan and Ganem 2005; Haasnoot et al.2007; Qiu et al.2017). Alternatively, multiple VSR proteins have been shown to directly target the key components of the RNAi pathway, such as Dicer or AGO proteins. For example, Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) B2 can directly bind to Drosophila Dicer-2 to inhibit vsiRNA production (Qi et al.2011, 2012), while Cricket paralysis virus 1A has been found to directly inhibit Drosophila AGO2 (Nayak et al.2018).",

            "text": "In the case of HCV, the core protein was found to suppress RNAi by interacting with Dicer (Chen et al.2008). Moreover, HCV structural E2 protein was also identified to antagonize RNAi by targeting AGO2 (Ji et al.2008). Consistent with the findings in HCV, a number of RNA viruses were shown to encode more than one viral protein to counteract RNAi. For instance, VP35, VP30 and VP40 of EBOV were found to suppress RNAi through different mechanisms (Haasnoot et al.2007; Fabozzi et al.2011). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encoded 7a and nucleocapsid contain RNAi suppression activities (Karjee et al.2010; Cui et al.2015). Besides, Tat and Nef proteins of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) were identified to suppress RNAi through the dsRNA-binding and AGO interaction, respectively (Bennasser et al.2005; Aqil et al.2013). The phenomena of viruses encoding multiple VSRs as well as VSRs targeting different steps of the RNAi pathway highlight the importance of suppressing RNAi during the viral life cycle. Although the structural core and E2 proteins of HCV were shown to suppress RNAi, it is unclear if any HCV nonstructural protein contains RNAi suppression activity.",

As a counter-defense to RNAi, viruses evolved to encode VSRs that were identified to target different steps of the RNAi pathway. In the present study, we screened the viral nonstructural proteins of HCV for RNAi suppression activity and found that HCV NS2 protein is a VSR. The gel shift and RNA-IP analyses show that HCV NS2 possesses both dsRNA- and siRNA-binding activities that are required for RNAi suppression. Thus, we speculate that HCV NS2 may function as VSR by shielding virus-derived dsRNA from Dicer cleavage and binding to viral siRNA to interfere with RISC assembly.",

HCV core interacts with Dicer and inhibits the siRNA production, while HCV E2 can block the RISC assembly by interacting with AGO2. Interestingly, we showed that HCV NS2 as a VSR can target the RNA components of the RNAi pathway by directly binding to dsRNA and siRNA. These results indicate that HCV can suppress antiviral RNAi at different stages by encoding multiple VSRs. This phenomenon can also be found in other RNA viruses, such as EBOV, SARS-CoV, HIV-1 and DENV (Bennasser et al.2005; Karjee et al.2010; Fabozzi et al.2011; Aqil et al.2013; Kakumani et al.2013; Cui et al.2015; Kakumani et al.2015). Thus, encoding multiple VSRs that target different steps of the RNAi pathway may offer advantages in the mode of action required for efficient suppression of RNAi, thereby highlighting the importance of the antiviral RNAi in the host-virus interactions.",

It contains a protease domain that functions as a cysteine protease to catalyze a cleavage between NS2 and NS3 (Pieroni et al.1997). Besides, NS2 colocalizes with E1, E2 NS3 and NS5A near the core protein and lipid droplet during the virion assembly (Ma et al.2011). Moreover, NS2 can work as a potent interferon antagonist and apoptosis inhibitor (Erdtmann et al.2003; Kaukinen et al.2013). Here we found that HCV NS2 contains an RNAi suppression activity, adding a novel function to its multiple roles in the viral life cycle. HCV NS2 is identified to possess dsRNA- and siRNA-binding activities, similar to many other VSRs such as NoV B2 and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid. However, although these VSRs use the same strategy of suppressing RNAi by sequestrating dsRNA and/or siRNA, they do not share sequence identity or structural conservation, suggesting that VSRs of distinct virus families are evolved independently during the viral evolution.",

Our mutational analyses showed that mutation of C184 abolished the dsRNA- and siRNA-binding activities of HCV NS2 and eliminated its VSR activity, implying the dimerization of HCV NS2 is required for its RNAi suppression activity. Our findings are consistent with the previous observations that dimerization is important for VSR activities of many viruses.
