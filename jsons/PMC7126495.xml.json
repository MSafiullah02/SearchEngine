Therefore, complex networks have been used to model populations (May, 2006, Watts, Strogatz, 1998). Formally, a network is a structure used to model pairwise relations between objects and is defined by an ordered pair G=(V,E), where V is the nodes (also called vertices) set and E the edges set. The edges link the nodes and such connection may have many interpretations:\n\u2022electric energy distribution system, where generators and transformers form the nodes set and transmission lines form the edges set;\u2022\nworld wide web, where web pages are the nodes and hyperlinks, the edges;\u2022citation network, where scientific texts are the nodes and citations, the edges;\nand so on. Here, an individual is one node and a interaction between two individuals is represented by an undirected edge and the population model is defined (Albert, Barabasi, 2002, Newman, 2010). Usually, networks have undirected and unweighted edges (Bansal & Meyers, 2012), though some asymmetrical biological structures need to be modeled by directed networks (Moslonka-Lefebvre, Harwood, Jeger, Pautasso, 2012, Moslonka-Lefebvre, Pautasso, Jeger, 2009).",

By using complex networks in these circumstances, it is possible to find relations between the population structure and disease characteristics. Such structure is measured by the topological parameters of the network (for instance clustering coefficient and shortest path, which will be also explored in the next section) (Keeling, 2005).

The effect of network behavior and topology on model performance is also frequently evaluated (\u00d3skarsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2017). In the Linguistic area, for example, in which many studies have emerged due to explosive growth of Internet, complex network model for semantic representation of human language presents a behavior of scale-free network (Wachs-Lopes & Rodrigues, 2016). In this context, feature or attribute selection, which search for the best subset of attributes in a dataset, is a useful method for leading to a less redundant data, modeling accuracy improvement and reduced processing time for training expert systems (Aladeemy, Tutun, Khasawneh, 2017, Elangovan, Devasenapati, Sakthivel, Ramachandran, 2011).",

The objective of this work is, regardless of the network/population model, analyze which topological parameters are more relevant for a disease success or failure by using PCA. From an epidemiological point of view, such methodology complement works which deal with partial information to either extract disease outbreaks characteristics (Colizza, Vespignani, 2008, Moreno, Pastor-Satorras, Vespignani, 2002) or decide control actions (Ole\u015b, Gudowska-Nowak, Kleczkowski, 2012, Ole\u015b, Gudowska-Nowak, Kleczkowski, 2014, Xiao, Zhou, Tang, 2011). By using a wider range of population structures, it is possible to measure disease strength regardless of structure model.

High value of R\n0, most part of population in Recovered state, almost all Susceptible individuals getting infected are characteristics of a well known scenario for child diseases like mumps, chickenpox and measles if a age stratified population is considered (Wallinga, Teunis, & Kretzschmar, 2006).",
