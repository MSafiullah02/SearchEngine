I read, with great appreciation, Kaiser, et al's editorial \"Our Response to COVID-19 as Endocrinologists and Diabetologists (1)\" highlighting important aspects of medicine our specialty will provide noteworthy impact. I would like to add that our embrace of telemedicine provides the ability to safely care for those patients with adrenal disease or on chronic steroid therapy, hypothalamic-pituitary disease and the spectrum of diabetes mellitus (DM). For our whole healthcare system to take advantage of technology which allows the safe practice of medicine while in a full state of emergency, some restrictions to using telehealth have been lifted. This is an imperative transition incorporating more telemedicine which has been desired for some time, but broad utilization has been hindered due to a variety of regulatory and reimbursement barriers (4).",

Many patients who require endocrinology care have special considerations regarding their increased risk of morbidity and mortality should they become afflicted with covid-19 such as those with any type of adrenal insufficiency or other condition requiring long-term glucocorticoids, hypothalamic-pituitary disorders and certainly the spectrum of diabetes mellitus (5) . Endocrinologists and diabetologists are in a unique position to provide consultation or direct care to patients via telemedicine using provided history, data-mining the chart, lab or radiology data and diabetes technology (6) . Comprehensive diabetes care clinics can upload data from glucose meters or preferably continuous glucose monitors, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices (insulin pumps) or other mobile health applications while providing virtual \"dynamic diabetology\" care and counseling from physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, registered dieticians and diabetes educators.",
