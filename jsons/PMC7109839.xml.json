These recruits were distributed among a total of 196 housing units. Oropharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all recruits discharged from the MCU or the PCU, and they were processed to detect the presence or absence of adenovirus, as described elsewhere [5].

There was not a statistically significant difference between the FRI rates in the open and closed units as a whole, although the tendency was for the closed units to exhibit higher rates. The rejection of the hypothesis suggests that the primary route of transmission of FRI is not via the MCU/PCU recycling protocol (i.e., not via person-to-person contact between unit members and members newly introduced to the unit [i.e., potentially infectious convalescents]). The social distancing instituted in this setting was not successful in decreasing FRI rates. These results should be placed in the context of our finding of the existence of substantial environmental pathogen contamination in the housing units. The lessons may be similar for any setting in which environmental transmission of pathogens is likely.",

The spread of a pathogen via an indirect surface route makes sense if it is shown that the pathogen can persist on the surface for a sufficient duration, as Boone and Gerba [29] have shown, with hand contact an essential mode of transmission [34]. Of the viral pathogens responsible for respiratory illness, coronavirus [35, 36], influenza [37], rhinovirus [30], and adenovirus [16, 23] are likely to be transmissible via environmental surfaces in different conditions of room air [29, 38\u201340].

It is possible that these structures are contaminated by infectious individuals and are not themselves infectious. However, because these are the structures where the subjects live and receive medical care, and because it is known that adenovirus is transmissible via surface-to-hand contact [29], these findings suggest that environmental sources of infection are critical to the propagation and maintenance of high FRI prevalence rates in this setting.

Survival on surfaces may explain the persistence of Ad4 and its type-specific niche at a training center, but, because it is also clear that Ad4 can be transmitted by person-to-person contact, we must account for personal interactions. It is quite likely that recruits who are not already infected by Ad4 pick it up within their own units or while visiting the medical clinic (from its surfaces or other infectious recruits) and then bring it back to the unit. Person-to-person transmission is then facilitated by crowding, as the statistically significant association between population size and FRI rates indicate (figure 1).

On the other hand, at a naval recruit training center, Miller [19] found that newer, larger barracks with more space per recruit were associated with lower FRI rates, even though the number of recruits per room was equivalent in the old and new barracks. He suggested that some of these apparent contradictions may be due to the nature of the pathogen responsible and the time at which an outbreak occurs during training. For example, data produced by Breese et al. [13] show that, in the first 2 weeks of training, correlations between illness and density were relatively higher than those between illness and population size; however, the reverse was the case for the second 4 weeks. Thus, although it is natural to assume that there is some association between the number of people in a space and the rates of illness, it is advisable to keep in mind that population size and density may interact in different ways with the type of pathogen and the amount of time that a unit of people have been together (for comparison, see the article by Bernstein [11]).",

The rates of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) for these populations were significantly different. Although the units closed to an influx of potentially infectious convalescing persons (hereafter referred to as \u201cclosed units\u201d) generally had higher FRI rates than the units open to such an influx (hereafter referred to as \u201copen units\u201d), the difference was not significant. Logistic regression of the odds of an FRI diagnosis, in terms of the population size and unit type, showed that the difference in population size remained even after adjusting for unit type.",
