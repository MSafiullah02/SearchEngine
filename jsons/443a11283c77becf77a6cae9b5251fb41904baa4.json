            "text": "We explored whether children could apply linguistic strategies for lying, i.e., manipulating linguistic content of speech to mislead others. We announced a knowledge-test entailing prizes in the classrooms of a primary school and a middle school. Altogether 79 Chinese children (6-18 years) voluntarily participated in the test: listening to a series of animal sounds before guessing the names of the animals. Meanwhile, behind the participants, a video was playing images that ostensibly corresponded to the sounds being played. In fact, this was not necessarily the case, i.e., some items cannot be solved because the sounds played are not from any animal but machine-synthesized. Participants were instructed not to look back at the video. However, 51 children peeked at the video for the unsolvable items, although the peeking behavior decreased with age. Moreover, when explaining how they correctly guessed the unsolvable items, children as young as 6 years old were able to apply a linguistic strategy (i.e., \"capability attribution\") for lying. Besides \"capability attribution,\" Children also applied \"fortune attribution\" and \"topic shift\" for lying. Finally, \"fortune attribution\" and \"topic shift\" increased with age. Therefore, educators need to be aware that children are able to apply verbal strategies for lying that could involve truthful statements (i.e., \"topic shift\") or statements that are difficult to be proved as untruthful (i.e., \"fortune attribution\").",

Linguistic strategies are the ways speakers manipulate their linguistic content of speech for their purpose. Consistently, linguistic strategies for lying are the ways liars manipulate the linguistic content of speech to mislead others, which could involve truthful statements. For example, if one asks a salesman whether ginseng is good for one's health, the salesman could say: \"People who eat ginseng every day live longer than others.\" This may be true, but it is irrelevant to the question (i.e., \"topic shift\") and is misleading. (People who eat expensive ginseng every day are wealthy and thus live better). A study demonstrated that 5-year-old children judged false implicatures (e.g., telling a truth: \"she is smiling at you.\" when the speaker knows that she is actually angry at you) as lies (Antomo et al., 2018) .",

The majority of children peeked due to the highly tempting nature of the situation. As soon as children peeked at the toy, the experimenter returned to the room and asked the children if they had peeked. Among the threeyear-olds who peeked, 38% lied by denying they had peeked, 38% confessed, and 24% gave no verbal response.

Another study found that older children were able to devise highly plausible explanations for their knowledge (Talwar and Lee, 2008) . Finally, Evans and Lee (2011) found that lying was less prevalent among 41 eleven-to thirteen-year-old and 34 fourteen-to sixteen-year old children than 33 eight-to ten-year-old children; however, no significant age difference was found for the \"sophistication of lies\" (i.e., \"ability to maintain their lie by concealing incriminating knowledge they ought not to know\").

Moreover, there is no study on linguistic strategies for lying among Chinese children. To investigate the linguistic strategies for lying among Chinese Children aged 6-18, we applied an adapted temptation resistance paradigm: some items in the knowledge-test are impossible to be solved without transgression, and the transgressed children were asked how they responded correctly on these unsolvable items. Although the temptation resistance paradigm used in this study also involved eliciting a form of \"truth-concealing\" from participants, our focus was on the question about how they solved the unsolvable items, which might elicit truthful but misleading statements.",

Moreover, unlike most studies on lying in which responses are categorized dichotomously into truth-telling or lying, verbal strategies for lying could take many different forms and involve truthful statements, the speakers make \"choices according to perceived options\" (Corbin and Strauss, 1990) . Finally, children in this study were seen as \"having, though not always utilizing, the means of controlling their destinies by their responses to conditions\" (Corbin and Strauss, 1990 ); therefore, this study did not only aim to \"uncover relevant conditions but also to determine how the actors under investigation actively respond to those conditions\" (Corbin and Strauss, 1990) .",

Second, they read the original transcript of all the participants' responses. Third, they independently labeled each response with a provisional conceptual term (e.g., \"learned by watching TV\") in Excel 2010. If a response is perceived as resembling the same conceptual term proposed before, then the response is labeled with that conceptual term; otherwise, a new conceptual term should be proposed. A response could be labeled with multiple terms, listed on multiple columns in Excel. Fourth, after labeling all the responses, the graduate students used the \"filter\" in Excel to compare all the responses under the same conceptual term, and then across different conceptual terms. A term would be discarded unless it stood up to continued scrutiny through its repeated proven relevance to the phenomenon under question. Conceptual terms (e.g., \"learned by watching TV, \" \"learned by reading books\") pertaining to the same phenomenon were grouped to form the same categories (e.g., \"capability attribution\"), which are higher-level, more abstract concepts. Fifth, the first author of this report read the concepts and all the responses under each concept and then discussed with the graduate students for new insights and increased theoretical sensitivity. Conceptual terms were revised (e.g., \"lucky\" to \"fortune attribution\") to systematically resemble the full range of variation of the phenomena. A codebook was then developed based on the final conceptual terms. Finally, two trained coders coded each participant's linguistic strategy for lying according to the codebook. For all the codes, coder agreements were higher than 80%, kappa values higher than 0.70. The final frequency of each code was obtained after the coders reached consensus through a discussion about the initial disagreements.",

Nevertheless, \"capability attribution\" was the most commonly identified linguistic strategy among our participants.

Our results further suggested that \"capability attribution\" was not the only strategy children applied for lying. More advanced linguistic strategies for lying, such as \"fortune attribution\" and \"topic shift, \" continued to develop with age. The development in the linguistic strategy for lying is probably due to the years of practice in lying, lie-detection, and anti-lie-detection.",

However, our study showed that all of the participants who cheated applied some linguistic strategy when responding to the experimenter's further questioning. Note that this study investigated children's answers to open-ended questions rather than binary answers to truth/lie questions, adopting a Grounded theory method to investigate children's choices according to their \"perceived options\" (Corbin and Strauss, 1990 ). Children in this study \"are seen as having, though not always utilizing, the means of controlling their destinies by their responses to conditions\" (Corbin and Strauss, 1990) ; therefore, this study demonstrated how children \"actively respond to those conditions\" (Corbin and Strauss, 1990) . As a result, creativity in children's verbal strategies was exposed rather than hidden. Similarly, a previous study applying an open question design demonstrated the development of non-verbal tactical deception among children (Smith and LaFreniere, 2013) . Six participants who had confessed transgression lied about the degree of their transgression (i.e., the number of times they had peeked) with immediate follow-up explanations. Moreover, five children confessed transgression but lied about how they got the answers to the unsolvable items. Therefore, participants cannot be categorized dichotomously into liars and truth-tellers. These results supported the Information Manipulation Theory proposed by McCornack et al. (2014) : even after a confession, an individual could still manipulate partial information covertly along multiple dimensions and as a contextual problem-solving activity driven by the desire for quick, efficient, and viable communicative solutions for their reputations and interests.",

Chinese children applied three linguistic strategies for lying when justifying correct answers to unsolvable items, i.e., \"capability attribution, \" \"fortune attribution, \" and \"topic shift.\" Besides, cheating and lying decreased, whereas strategies of \"fortune attribution\" and \"topic shift\" increased from 6 to 18 with age. Children's linguistic strategy for lying may develop through years of lying, lie-detection, and antilie-detection practices; after learning that telling untruthful statements is risky. Therefore, educators need to be aware that children are able to apply verbal strategies for lying that could involve truthful statements (i.e., \"topic shift\") or statements that are difficult to be proved as untruthful (i.e., \"fortune attribution\").",
