Countries that have flattened their coronavirus curves prove that interventions can bring COVID-19 under control. These achievements hold lessons, such as the strict social distancing and coordinated efforts of all government levels in China and massive testing in South Korea, for other countries battling the coronavirus around the world. In this work, we attempt to estimate how many COVID-19 cases could have been prevented in the United States (US) when compared with the US's actual number of cases assuming that on a certain date, the US took China-like or South Korea-like interventions and that these interventions would have been as effective in the US as in China and South Korea. We found that if that date was at the early stage of the outbreak (March 10), more than 99% (1.15 million) fewer infected cases could be expected by the end of the epidemic. This number decreases to 66.03% and 73.06% fewer infected cases with the China-like scenario and the South Korea-like scenario, respectively, if actions were taken on April 1, highlighting the need to respond quickly and effectively to fight the virus.

The extremely strict approach that China employed allowed the reproduction number to be stably below 1.0; this approach contained the virus spread in China and prevented it from spreading further. The aggressive massive testing of viruses together with other less strict measures also reduced the reproduction numbers with possible fluctuations. If similar approaches had been adopted in the US at the early stage of outbreak, e.g., two weeks after the first case without clear ties to an existing outbreak, more than 99% fewer infected cases (1.15 million) could be expected for the US by the end of the epidemic under both the China model and the South Korea model. The basic idea of our analysis, that is, to connect the time series of the reproduction numbers of China and the US, has its own limitations. In principle, one should develop a model with the existing conditions [28, 29] of the US and modify the parameters in the US model by conceptualizing the key strategies in China or South Korea to determine how many infected cases there will be at the end or at a time in the middle. However, developing such a model requires many parameters and unknown information, which may be time-dependent and have high uncertainty. Therefore, in this work, we simply assume that regardless of the strategies, they will have the same effectiveness in China or South Korea as in the US and connect the time series of the reproduction numbers R us (t) to R cn (t) or R kr (t). This is an oversimplification. Another potential issue is the extrapolation of the reproduction numbers R us (t) for t > T , where T is the last date of our data.

Results of other countries in addition to the US can be found in the supplementary file. In fact, each country has its own unique challenges in the face of the outbreak, and there is no successful experience in one country that can be completely reproduced in another country. Other countries need to consider their own situation, including outbreak severity, testing regimes, medical capacities, the health-care system, and culture, before deciding on a direction. However, every country must act quickly and powerfully to fight the virus, and any government's inaction with regard to epidemics could pose a serious challenge to global public health.

From the official reports, we classify all cases when possible into imported cases, first-generation cases that are infected by the imported cases, and second-generation and beyond cases, which are infected by the first-generation and beyond cases. Of course, by doing so, we discarded a portion of cases for which we could not determine the generation number. To reduce the bias of this step on the reproduction number, we only make use of the data in those provinces where a large portion of the cases have been classified into generations. Ultimately, we arrived at a dataset of Chinese cases in 11 provinces where, on average, 85% cases have been identified.
