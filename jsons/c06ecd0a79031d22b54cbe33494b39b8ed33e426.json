It is characterised by acute inflammation, oedema and necrosis of epithelial cells lining the small airways, increased mucous production and bronchospasm. 1 It is estimated that up to 90% of infections are caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) though many other viruses can cause infection including bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus and enterovirus. 2 Ninety per cent of children are infected with RSV in the first 2 years of life and up to 40% of these children will have lower respiratory infection. 1, 3, 4 Severe bronchiolitis is defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics as 'signs and symptoms associated with poor feeding and respiratory distress characterised by tachypnoea, nasal flaring and hypoxemia'. 1 Epidemiological evidence shows that premature birth (less than 37 weeks) and young age (less than 6-12 weeks) at the start of the bronchiolitis season are associated with an increased risk of severe disease. [5] [6] [7] Underlying conditions that have been associated with an increased risk of progression to severe disease or mortality include haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease of prematurity and the immunocompromised infant. 5, 8, 9 Hospital admission rates for children with bronchiolitis vary between 1 and 3% and it is estimated that approximately 10% of hospitalised infants will require admission to intensive care. [10] [11] [12] About 10-15% of infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity are re-hospitalised with bronchiolitis, but 5-10% of all preterm infants (<35 weeks) without lung disease also require admission. 13 For infants who are admitted to intensive care and who require assisted ventilatory support, the mean duration of ventilation is also longer for infants with preexisting disorders. 14 Although overall bronchiolitis-associated mortality remains low (1.82/100 000 for children in the United Kingdom 15 ), mortality rates for ex-preterm infants, especially in association with RSV infection, can be considerably higher. 16 The aim of this study was to compare preterm and term infants with bronchiolitis who were retrieved from regional Victorian hospitals with respect to their demographic characteristics at time of referral and treatment requirements during the retrieval process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 259, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 514, "end": 515, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 666, "end": 668, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 669, "end": 671, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 672, "end": 673, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 880, "end": 881, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1093, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1097, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1354, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1357, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1359, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1552, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1557, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1760, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2178, "end": 2180, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What this paper adds"}, {"text": "This retrospective cohort study used data collected on infants transported by Newborn Emergency Transport Service Victoria (NETS VIC), between January 2003 and July 2007.

There are many factors that increase the risk of re-hospitalisation of preterm infants. Seasonal factors including time of discharge in relation to autumn and winter and physiological factors including the presence of pulmonary and neurological disability, as well as birthweight and young age at time of infection, all contribute to this increased risk. 17 Even in the absence of chronic lung disease, infants born preterm but at later gestation remain at increased risk of hospital re-admission. 18 All values are expressed as mean and standard deviation. FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; pCO2, partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The need for assisted respiratory support (either CPAP or IMV) was greater in the preterm group. The main physiological difference seen among all infants requiring assisted support versus those who did not was their oxygen requirement at initial assessment. Within the group requiring assisted support, a large proportion of infants (56/89) were transported using CPAP. Non-invasive ventilation with CPAP has been used in paediatric and neonatal intensive care to manage patients with bronchiolitis since the 1970s. 19 There are many advantages to using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in the management of bronchiolitis over endotracheal intubation. These include but are not limited to a reduced need for sedation and muscle relaxation, a reduction in ventilator-associated complications and trends towards reduction in supplemental oxygen therapy. 20 The finding that apnoea was more common in premature infants is consistent with previous observational studies. 21 In fact, apnoea may be the first (and only) sign of the disease. The exact pathophysiology of bronchiolitis-related apnoea in infants remains unclear though immaturity of the respiratory control centre in the brain-stem is likely to play an important role. A further independent risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis-related apnoea includes young age at the time of infection. 22, 23 Preterm infants in this study were more likely to receive a fluid bolus. It is estimated that up to 30% of infants admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis will require fluid replacement therapy, the reasons for this include decreased oral intake and increased insensible losses through fever and increased respiratory rate. 24 For infants in this study, the stated reason for administering a fluid bolus in the majority of cases was decreased perfusion or prolonged capillary refill; however, this reason alone does not explain why more preterm infants in this cohort required fluid resuscitation. For infants requiring fluid replacement, consideration should be given to the potential complications of accidental water intoxication and electrolyte imbalances that may occur in association with this condition. 25 Extrapulmonary manifestations may also occur in bronchiolitis caused by RSV infection. These include the following: endocrine abnormalities with increased production of anti-diuretic hormone; acute neurological signs such as depressed level of consciousness and seizures (due to inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone production and low sodium); and acute hepatitis and cardiac abnormalities including arrhythmias and hypotension (related to myocardial and/or hepatic infection and inflammation). [26] [27] [28] [29] Previous studies have shown that hypotension associated with RSV infection frequently responds to fluid boluses with either crystalloid or colloid, followed by restricted maintenance fluids, and that inotropic support is less often required. 30 Quite a high proportion of both preterm and term infants included for analysis were treated with antibiotics. This may be a result of antibiotics being commenced during initial management of infants who present with signs of systemic infection and then ceased when culture results are available. In general, when the diagnosis is clear and the infant does not have any coexisting morbidities, antibiotics are not considered useful in the management of bronchiolitis. 31, 32 However, previous studies of infants admitted to paediatric intensive care units with severe disease have indicated that up to 40% of children may have secondary bacterial infection. 33 In this latter group, the ongoing use of antibiotics should be guided by surveillance of culture results, clinical condition and response to treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 130, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 689, "end": 691, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1487, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1833, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1948, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2340, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2343, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2670, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3155, "end": 3157, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3652, "end": 3656, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3657, "end": 3661, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3662, "end": 3666, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3667, "end": 3671, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3914, "end": 3916, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 4384, "end": 4387, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4388, "end": 4390, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4574, "end": 4576, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We acknowledge that there are limitations to this study.
