Better characterisation of the sufficiency and durability of immune responses following mild COVID-19 disease is essential, as is careful exploration of potential antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease during re-infection. ADE has not been observed in any of the other beta coronaviruses, but SARS CoV-2 is an unpredictable novel virus. The acceptability and safety of voluntary natural infection of low risk groups requires better data and preferably better treatment before it is even contemplated. If the infection of large numbers of volunteers is not considered safe or feasible, then the infection of smaller numbers of volunteers could still be useful in assisting urgent drug and vaccine development (11) and there is growing support for this concept (12)provisionally also from the World Health Organisation (13) .",

Alternatively, elimination can be achieved if very stringent lockdown measures terminate all transmission for a sufficient period of time to eliminate any remaining viral reservoirs.

The longer term 'exit strategy' needs to consider and balance not only the health outcomes, but also the social and economic consequences of any course of action. Given the caveats around establishing natural 'herd immunity' in the absence of better data on the safety and immunogenicity of natural SARS CoV-2 infection, every effort should be made to find a safe and effective vaccine in the shortest possible time frame. Although competition drives invention and efficiency, we are faced with a global problem that requires global solutions and excessive rivalry may hamper a coordinated global effort that will provide community protection to ALL, irrespective of their nationality or ability to pay.",
