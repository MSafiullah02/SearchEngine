Hundreds suffered from a pneumonia-like strange disease, some of whom died. Both the Chinese government and the Chinese media remained silent as to the risk of a possible epidemic. No one in the rest of the world knew there was any real cause for alarm. But in March, local outbreaks of a mysterious disease were reported in Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert. Even then, health authorities could not reveal where the disease had come from. This story at the onset of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak poses an interesting question. Is it possible to discover the presence of a missing disease spreader from the surveillance records on the cases in other regions? This study addresses such a node discovery problem for the spread of an infectious disease.",

            "text": "The spread of an infectious disease is a stochastic phenomenon in a spatially heterogeneous medium. Many mathematical models of disease transmission [1] rely on an epidemiological compartment model and a meta-population network model in formulating stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity [2], [3]. These models are described by a system of stochastic differential equations [4]. The analysis of the spread includes many tasks from reproduction to prediction. Reproduction of the actual spread [5], [6] is essential in understanding the role of a so-called super-spreader [7], [8] and epidemiological thresholds [9], [10]. This is a forward analysis. An inverse analysis includes estimating the transmission parameters from observation [11], [12]. Network profiling estimates the effectively decisive topology of a transportation network which governs the spread [13]. Network inference in a communication network [14] is a similar problem. Statistical learning and computational Monte Carlo simulation contribute to developing a reliable bio-surveillance system in a noisy environment [15], detecting abnormal events [16] as an omen of the outbreak [17], and predicting the spread to aid health authorities in containing the outbreak [18]. None of these, however, addresses the problem. A node discovery problem for a social network [19] is discovering a person who does not appear in the logs on communication, but is actually influential to others in an organization. The substantial nature of the problem is the same as this. But the mathematical solution should be different entirely because of the difference in the mechanism of the spread.",

The missing spreader may be the place where the first patient appears (an index node) or not (an intermediate node). Its presence impedes the reproduction of the observed spread by an unperturbed mathematical model. The irreproducibility is rather the clue to solve the problem. Two statistical discriminators are invented. Their role is discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to the missing spreader node, and the rest (non-neighboring nodes), given a dataset. It is a collection of the time sequence data on the number of cases, or on the cumulative number of new cases, at the nodes within the scope of surveillance in the early growth phase of the spread. The network topology and transmission parameters may be given as an input to the discriminators. Or they may be unknown and must be estimated. The discriminators examine the mid-body or the tail-ends of the probability density function of the number of cases, and search for disturbed time sequence data to which the perturbation gives rise. The mid-body discriminator is founded on the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. The tail-end discriminator is founded on the Chauvenet rejection test. The discriminators are tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the WHO datasets on the SARS outbreak and on the flu pandemic (H1N1 swine influenza A) in 2009.",

In the simple network in 3.2, this results in mi(td+1|\u03b8\u02c6,0)\u223cmi(td+1|\u03b8,\u03b3\u2032) and vij(td+1|\u03b8\u02c6,0)\u223cvij(td+1|\u03b8,\u03b3\u2032), consequently \u3008zn\u3009\u223c0 and \u3008(zn\u2212\u3008zn\u3009)2\u3009\u223c1, rather than Eqs.

The estimator reproduces the spread accurately. On the other hand, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes for the estimator \u03b8\u02c6 is much smaller than that for a given \u03b8 when the missing spreader node is an index node. The difference in \u3008mi\u3009, and that in \u3008vii\u3009 are so small that nn can not be distinguished from na by examining the lower order moments. This is the reason why the mid-body discriminator is not suitable if \u03b8 is unknown.

(7). The term is more complex than a mere Gaussian white noise because its amplitude includes Ii(t), and the ensemble of sample trajectories Ii(t) does not obey a multi-variate normal distribution in Eq. (1) for large t. Eq. (7) is correct on the average, but the conversion of the higher order moments from \u0394Ji(td) to Ii(td) is inaccurately distortive. It is the reason why the tail-end discriminator is only moderately excellent, and the shape of the curve looks awkward when \u03b8 is given. On the other hand, when \u03b8 is unknown, the estimator \u03b8\u02c6 may be able to make up for the distortion in the higher order moments. The tail-end discriminator with the estimator \u03b8\u02c6 outperforms the discriminators for a given \u03b8. Even if the true parameters are given, adjusting the parameters is rather indispensable for excellent discrimination from \u0394Ji(td). Substantial improvement of Eq.

The lower order moments averaged over the all regions are \u3008mi\u3009=\u22120.11 and \u3008vii\u3009=1.3. The entire dataset is not disturbed. The lower order moments tend to be anomalous for the United States and Mexico, while the higher order moments are anomalously large for Canada. Irregularly, Japan has large absolute values of both lower and higher order moments. The higher order moments for South American countries tend to be large while those for West European countries are small. This may be related to the seasonality for the tropics and the northern hemisphere. The estimated values of the parameters are \u03b1\u02c6=0.88, \u03b2\u02c6=0.77 (r=1.2), and \u03b3\u02c6=0.29. The optimal threshold L\u2217=\u22124.2 is obtained in the experiment for this condition. Perturbation is discovered in the time sequence data for the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan. The ratio of this number is 4/N=0.18, which is remarkably smaller than 7/N=0.64 for the SARS outbreak. In addition, the absolute value of L is much less anomalous than that for the SARS outbreak. In most regions, L is close to 0 while L is less than \u22122 for the SARS outbreak. The disturbance from an unknown origin of perturbation is small and localized. Then, what happened to the spread in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan?",

The annual number of passengers from Mexico to the United States by land is 24 times larger than that by air in 2009. The number from Canada to the United States by land is 7 times larger than that by air in 2005. The meta-population network model relies on Eq. (14) which is known to be valid for the world-wide air transportation. The actual heavy land transportation lets the probability of movement across the border deviate from the value estimated in the model. This is supported by the result that the fraction \u03b3\u02c6 is twice as large as that for the SARS outbreak. The deviation imposes an impact on the speed of the spread at such cities near the border as San Ysidro CA, then inland cities, and finally such cities near another border as Buffalo\u2013Niagara Falls NY [32]. The discovered signal of perturbation for the United States, Mexico, and Canada could originate in a localized exception to the empirical law for the probability of movement, rather than a missing spreader node.",

The ratio is significantly higher than 1.4 to 1.6 from an epidemiological analysis, or 1.2 from a genetic analysis, in Mexico and other countries [34]. School closure started on May 17 just after the secondary transmission had been confirmed and announced officially. The effective reproductive ratio declined below 1. The reproductive ratio in Japan rose and fell sharply in 10 days in early May. The precondition of the SIR compartment model is that the values of the transmission parameters do not depend on time and sub-populations.

On the other hand, the signal discovered by the discriminators satisfies the sufficient condition to ascertain the presence of a missing spreader node incompletely, although it satisfies the necessary conditions. Prior knowledge on the demographic and socioeconomic nature of individual regions makes up for the incompleteness. This is similar to the false positives where the signal identified an early warning for a catastrophe originates in wide classes of impending transitions because the underlying mechanism is understood incompletely [35]. It is also of interest to see if the discovered location of a missing node satisfies the criterion for a strongly influential spreader in the core of the network [36]. Is it possible to distinguish the presence of a missing spreader node from an anomaly on the parameters mathematically? The solution will be worked out by examining how possible origins of perturbation appear in respective order moments of the disturbed time sequence data, and by finding a suitable backward mapping from the pattern of disturbance to the possible origins. The criterion for discrimination may be a complex function of the preconditions of a mathematical model, experimental conditions, and given datasets, rather than a simple scalar threshold of a test statistic in this study. These issues are for future challenges.",

The performance depends neither on the speed of the spread, on the size of the network, nor on the number of data much. If the cumulative number of new cases is given as a dataset, discrimination is moderately excellent, and interestingly, the tail-end discriminator works more excellently when the parameters are unknown than when they are given.
