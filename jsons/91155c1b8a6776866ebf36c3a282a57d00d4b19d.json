However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100%in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence of COVID-19 is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and around the world. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions.",

The framework would consist of: (1) selecting an established well-validated test, with documented sensitivity and specificity as close to 100%, as possible, to use as the referencepoint assay or test kit; (2) Using that test kit to develop a series of \"True Positive\" and \"True Negative\" test samples; and (3) Using that set of test samples to estimate the sensitivity/ specificity or positive predictive value/negative predictive value of the study test kit. As we will mention later it may also be important to know the sensitivity and specificity of the referencepoint assay or test kit. This is similar to what assay manufacturers are required to do in their validation of test kits, but which is often carried out under ideal conditions. As described below, the framework for determining levels of sensitivity and specificity should resemble normal conditions of use, as much as possible, and take into account sources of error including those that occur in the preanalytical phase (4).",
