Despite research attempts over many years, our understanding the mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ACE is still far from complete. Here, we present results of all atom molecular dynamics simulations of ACE with and without ligands. Two types of inhibitors, competitive and mixed non-competitive, were used to model the ligand bound forms. In the absence of a ligand the simulation showed spontaneous large hinge-bending motions of multiple conversions between the closed and open states of ACE, while the ligand bound forms were stable in the closed state. Our simulation results imply that the equilibrium between pre-existing backbone conformations shifts in the presence of a ligand. The hinge-bending motion of ACE is considered as an essential to the enzyme function. A mechanistic model of activation and the inhibition may provide valuable information for novel inhibitors of ACE.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Hypertension, a long-term medical condition known as high blood pressure, is a major risk factor for vision loss, stroke, heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and more than a quarter of the world's adult population in 2000 had hypertension [1] . Therapeutic approaches have focused on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance in humans [2] . In the RAAS, renin stimulates the generation of angiotensin I (AngI), which is converted to vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII) by angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Two isoforms (somatic and testicular) of ACE are transcribed by ACE gene in a tissue-specific manner. The somatic form (sACE) is a zinc dependent dicarboxypeptidase, which includes two homologous domains (N domain and C domain) with~60% sequence identity and the same zinc motif HEXXH (X = any amino acid residue) [3, 4] . For the past decades, it has been reported that the C domain of human sACE has the main AngI converting site in controlling blood pressure and cardiovascular functions [5] . ACE hydrolyzes decapeptide (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu) AngI by cleaving a dipeptide from the C-terminus to produce octapeptide (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) AngII, which causes blood vessels to narrow and stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone, resulting in increased blood pressure [6, 7] . ACE also affects blood pressure by inactivating the vasodilators bradykinin and AngII, which causes blood vessels to narrow and stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone, resulting in increased blood pressure [6, 7] . ACE also affects blood pressure by inactivating the vasodilators bradykinin and kallidin [8] . Therefore, ACE has long been a major target for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular ailments by the use of ACE inhibitors [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 245, "end": 248, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 403, "end": 406, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 896, "end": 899, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 900, "end": 902, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1076, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1396, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1399, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1624, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1627, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1722, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1869, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Common synthetic ACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril, alacepril and lisinopril have been on the market for decades [10] .

This large hinge bending motion implies the existence of pre-existing backbone conformations. Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the enzyme. The secondary structure of the sACE is predominantly alpha helical ( Figure 1 ). The structure has an elliptical shape with dimensions approximately 73 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 52 \u00c5 3 , and the cleft around the active site expands about 31 \u00c5 (PDB ID: 4APH). The cleft divides the sACE into two subdomains, and the active site is located on the both of their inner surfaces. Two subdomains of sACE were defined as subdomain I including the N-terminus and the zinc ion (residues Asp40-Leu122, Pro297-Gly437, Asp551-Gly583) and subdomain II including the C-terminus (residues Glu123-Ala296, Gly438-Cys550, Gln584-Ser625).

We analyzed the distance between two lips of the mouth, showing conformational changes from the closed to the semi-open states and back to the closed state again (Figure 4a ). BPPb bound ACE was more flexible, and the AngII bound one made the mouth closed more tightly. The number of hydrogen bonds between the ligands and the enzyme was calculated over the simulation time ( Figure  S4 ). The average numbers were 6.52 \u00b1 2.15 and 6.05 \u00b1 1.64 for AngII and BPPb, respectively (Table 1) . This indicated that the opening and closing motions were affected by the interactions between the ligand with the enzyme. addition, the distance between two lips was calculated for ACE2. Based on the sequence alignment of ACE2 and sACE, two lips of ACE2 were identified as lip I composed of the residues 54-81, 289-296, 340-346, 361-370 of subdomain I and lip II composed of the residues 109-131, 143-156, 267-276 of subdomain II. The distances between lip I and lip II were computed as 13.32 \u00c5 and 20.64 \u00c5 for the closed and open states, respectively. This result is consistent with the distance analysis of sACE ( Figure 2 ). In order to test robustness of definition of backbone conformational states we also calculated the mouth open angles, and the results showed the similar pattern as distances ( Figure S3 ).

Two crystal structures of the sACE co-crystallized with ligands in the active site were used to build the simulation systems, sACE complex with the natural inhibitory peptide BPPb (PDB ID: 4APJ) and sACE complex with AngII (PDB ID: 4APH). In order to simulate the Apo form, AngII was removed from the active site of the crystal structure (4APH). The SPI bound to the sACE-AngII complex with the lowest score from the docking simulations was chosen to run the fourth MD simulation, and the last SPI bound sACE model was generated by removing the AngII from this docking simulation result.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparation of MD Simulations"}, {"text": "Charmm36 force field with explicit TIP3P water molecules was used in all simulations [38] .

Ligand chemical components in the original crystal structures including acetate ion, beta-D-mannose, N-acetyl-D-Glucosamine were also retained and modeled with Charmm general force field [39] . All five simulation systems were solvated in the truncated octahedral box with 23251, 23418, 23565, 23410 and 23374 TIP3P water molecules, respectively.

After solvation, 1000 steps of energy minimization were performed to remove possible bad contacts. Then, the MD simulations were started by gradually heating the systems from 10 to 310 K for 60 ps under the constant volume condition. In order to equilibrate the density of the systems, the simulation was switched to constant pressure and temperature (NPT) conditions and continued afterwards. The average pressure and the temperature were maintained at 1 bar and 310 K, respectively. All heavy atoms during the energy minimization, heating and the first 200 ps of NPT simulation were restrained with harmonic potential with a force constant 1 kcal/mol\u00b7A 2 . After that, the harmonic position restraints were removed, allowing all atoms in the systems to relax. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained, allowing an integration time step of 2 fs. The non-bonded interactions were smoothly truncated from 10 \u00c5 to 12 \u00c5 cutoff, and the particle-mesh Ewald method was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions [41] . The equilibration stages of simulations were determined based on RMSD and system energy calculations. Total simulation and equilibration times for BPPB-sACE, AngII-sACE, Apo, SPI-sACE-AngII, and SPI-sACE were 400 (32.26), 400 (28.26), 400 (24.36) , 360 (20.95), and 360 (13.26), respectively in nanoseconds. Summary of all MD simulations are provided in Table S3 . The production stage after discarding the initial equilibration stage, was used for the post simulation analysis except for RMSD calculation. All post analyses and visualization were carried out by Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program [42] .
