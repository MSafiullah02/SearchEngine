Combined with the increasing volume of available experimental (big) data, it constitutes a fundamental tool to shed light on the laws governing complex communities of living systems [4]. The traditional approach to population dynamics consists in the analysis of coupled deterministic equations describing the evolution of species abundances in a given community [5]. This procedure\u2014whose outcome is not necessarily simple [6,7]\u2014is adequate in many cases. However, deterministic approaches neglect the effect of fluctuations, and these are now acknowledged to be both inherent and essential to the organization of communities of living systems [8]. On the one hand, the discreteness and finiteness of populations lead to demographic noise, which has been shown to be responsible for a wealth of nontrivial phenomena, such as the emergence of complex statistical patterns in neutral communities [9,10], quasiperiodic oscillations in prey-predator systems [11], species formation [12], and others [13\u201315]. On the other hand, populations are strongly affected by fluctuations in external conditions [16,17], which in most of the cases are highly unpredictable. This source of stochasticity, usually called environmental noise, can have important consequences for, e.g., ecosystem stability [18,19] and evolutionary dynamics [20\u201324], and fosters species coexistence [25\u201328].",

            "text": "Remarkably, theoretical and empirical evidence reveals that these phenomena strongly rely on a specific interplay between the characteristic timescale of environmental variations and the intrinsic timescale of the dynamics [27\u201331]. Owing to this, theoretical approaches have to be constructed beyond simple white-noise approximations, i.e., including \u201ccolored\u201d (time-correlated) noise [32,33]. The question of how environmental colored noise affects population extinction has been widely studied in the literature, and there are contrasting positions on whether environmental fluctuations increase or decrease the risk of extinction, as this may actually depend on subtle differences of the underlying dynamics as well as the actual \u201ccolor\u201d of the fluctuations [34\u201340]. Of particular interest for our analyses here is the remarkable work of Kamenev et al. [40], who analyzed a logistic growth population-dynamic model in which birth and death rates fluctuate in time, showing that, depending on the interplay between the system size and the temporal scale of the environment, the model exhibits qualitatively different functional dependencies of the mean extinction time with the system size.",

To study this model we employ the so-called \u201cunified colored-noise approximation,\u201d which is exact in the limits of very large and very short correlation times [48,49], and study the resulting effective (white-noise) problem employing a standard path integral approach; analytical results are tested against direct computational simulations obtained employing a very careful numerical analysis scheme [50]. Using this combined approach, we scrutinize the model phase diagram and identify the parameters for which the population becomes extinct with certainty and those for which the population survives, as well as the threshold separating them, and how the resulting phase transition depends on environmental-noise time correlations. As we will show, the phase diagram becomes much richer in this case than in its noiseless counterpart.",

The state of the environment is encoded in a time-dependent variable, \u03b5(t), assumed to be independent of the state of system, so that \u03bb\u2192\u03bb(t)=\u03bb\u00af+\u03c3\u03b5(t), where \u03bb\u00af is the mean value, \u03c3 is a constant, and \u03b5(t) follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [54] (see Fig. 1):\n(2)\u03b5\u02d9=\u22121\u03c4\u03b5+2\u03c4\u03be(t),where \u03be(t) is a zero-mean Gaussian white noise with \u2329\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u232a=\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032). From Eq. (2), it follows that \u03bb is distributed as a Gaussian variable with mean \u03bb\u00af and autocorrelation function \u2329(\u03bb(t)\u2212\u03bb\u00af)(\u03bb(t\u2032)\u2212\u03bb\u00af)\u232a=\u03c32e|t\u2212t\u2032|/\u03c4 [54]. As we are interested in the interplay between the timescale of the dynamics and the environment, we keep the correlation time of the environment, \u03c4, as a control parameter throughout our analysis. Let us also note that, for sufficiently large values of \u03c3, it may occur that \u03bb(t)<0, so we restrict our analysis to the regime of small variability, \u03c3\u226a\u03bb\u00af. Numerical analyses are performed keeping the constraint that \u03bb(t)=0 if a negative value is reached, but such events are extremely rare for \u03c3\u226a\u03bb\u00af. We have verified that other forms with bounded colored noise, as for instance dichotomous Markov noise [56], do not change qualitatively our main results.",

As a matter of fact, the method provides an exact equation for \u03c4\u21920 and \u03c4\u2192\u221e, whereas it is only approximate for intermediate timescales \u03c4. Thus, the UCNA can be understood as an \u201cinterpolation\u201d between the dynamics for rapidly and slowly varying environments, respectively [59] (see Appendix A).",

            "text": "For simplicity, it is convenient to rewrite Eq. (3) in terms of a new variable with additive rather than multiplicative noise. In particular, defining x=log\u03c1/(1\u2212\u03c1), so that x(\u03c1=0)=\u2212\u221e and x(\u03c1=1)=\u221e, Eq. (3) becomes [60]\n(4)x\u02d9(t)=\u03bb\u00af\u2212\u03bc\u2212\u03bcex+\u03c3\u03b5(t)\u2261f(x)+\u03c3\u03b5(t),where, to ease the notation we have introduced the drift term f(x)=\u03bb\u00af\u2212\u03bc\u2212\u03bcex. Unless explicitly stated, the forthcoming expressions remain valid for other choices of f(x). In the case of Eq. (4), after the elimination of the environmental variable \u03b5, the UCNA approximation leads to a Langevin equation with multiplicative noise of the form (see Appendix A for a more detailed presentation of the UCNA method):\n(5)x\u02d9(t)=a\u03c4(x)+g\u03c4(x)\u03b7(t),where \u03b7(t) is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and \u2329\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032)\u232a=\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032), which has to be understood in the Stratonovich sense [48], and where\n(6)a\u03c4(x)=f(x)1\u2212\u03c4f\u2032(x),g\u03c4(x)=2\u03c4\u03c31\u2212\u03c4f\u2032(x).Equation (5) is equivalent to the following Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution P(x,t) [54]:\n(7)\u2202tP(x,t)=\u2212\u2202xa\u03c4(x)+12g\u03c4(x)g\u03c4\u2032(x)P(x,t)+12\u2202x2g\u03c42(x)P(x,t),whose stationary solution, Pst(x), can be found analytically imposing the zero-flux condition:\n(8)Pst(x)=Z\u22121|1\u2212\u03c4f\u2032(x)|exp1\u03c4\u03c32\u222bxdyf(y)[1\u2212\u03c4f\u2032(y)],where we have introduced the potential V(x)=\u2212\u222bxf(y)dy and Z is a normalization constant. Introducing the expression of f(x), i.e., Eq. (4), and reverting the change of variables, Pst(\u03c1)=Pst[x(\u03c1)]dx/d\u03c1, one finally obtains the stationary distribution for the dynamics of Eq. (3) under the UCNA approximation:\n(9)Pst(\u03c1)=Z\u22121\u03c1\u03bb\u00af\u2212\u03bc\u03c32\u03c4\u221211+(\u03bc\u03c4\u22121)\u03c1(1\u2212\u03c1)\u03bb\u00af\u2212\u03bc\u03c32\u03c4+2\u00d7exp\u2212\u03bc\u03c4\u03c32\u03c11\u2212\u03c1\u221212\u03c32\u03bb\u00af\u2212\u03bc1\u2212\u03c12.Although Eq. (10) has a complicated form, its shape is chiefly controlled by the factor \u03c1\u03bb\u00af\u2212\u03bc\u03c32\u03c4\u22121, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In particular, if \u03bb\u00af<\u03bbc=\u03bc, then a nonintegrable singularity appears at \u03c1=0, i.e., the distribution is not normalizable. This means that Eq. (10) is not a truly stationary solution, and the only stationary solution corresponds to the absorbing state, Pst(\u03c1)=\u03b4(\u03c1) [61]. On the other hand, for \u03bb\u00af>\u03bbc=\u03bc, Eq. (10) can be safely normalized. Consequently, our first important result is that environmental variability does not shift the critical point for the process described by Eq. (3).\n",

These authors performed a path-integral formulation to the full problem, including both demographic and environmental stochasticity, and found diverse regimes depending on the ratio between system size and noise correlation time. In particular, the dependence on system-size of the mean extinction time changes from exponential in the absence of the environmental noise (as corresponds to the Arrhenius law) to a power law for a short-correlated noise (as is the case in our study) and to no dependence whatsoever for noise with very large correlation times. This last regime implies that when there are extremely long periods of adverse external conditions (as compared, using adequate rescaling units, with system size) the system reaches deterministically the absorbing state regardless its size. Let us notice that this situation is not accessible to our approach, as we set the system in the asymptotic limit of large N (where demographic effects can be neglected), and thus \u03c4 cannot be much larger than it. For the power-law regime, our simple method gives exactly the same dependence as in Ref. [40].",
