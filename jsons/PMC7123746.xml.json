Single-lung transplantation is generally used for non-septic lung diseases, whereas double-lung transplantation is mandatory for septic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis. Infections and episodes of acute rejection are both significant complications soon after LT. Moreover, the main obstacle to the long-term success of LT remains chronic rejection, characterized histologically as bronchiolitis obliterans. It occurs in up to two thirds of patients [7]. The most relevant risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after the number of previous acute rejection episodes and the incidence of persistent rejection is cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease [8]. Recent evidence also suggests a possible role for respiratory viruses (RV) as risk factors for chronic rejection in LTR [9, 10]. Finally, a restrictive allograph syndrome came up as a novel phenotype of chronic rejection with worse prognosis than BOS [11].",

Advanced age is also associated with an increased risk [16]. In some programs, mechanical ventilation is a major contraindication to LT as airway colonization with bacteria may lead to nosocomial infection and the associated respiratory muscle deconditioning may require prolonged postoperative ventilatory support. However, recent results have shown that pre-transplantation mechanical ventilation is not associated with a higher risk of later bacterial infection [17\u201319]. In fact, nowadays, most programs accept mechanical ventilation as a bridge for LT for candidates previously included on the waiting list.",

Candidates treated with corticoids or antimicrobial agents before transplantation have a higher incidence of infections due to bacteria and Candida spp. [16, 20]. On the other hand, low-dose pre-transplantation corticosteroid treatment has proved to be even beneficial; it allows LT in patients who cannot be completely weaned from such therapy [21]. In cases of single-LT plus pre-transplantation corticosteroid treatment, the remaining native lung may harbor opportunistic microorganisms, including Aspergillus spp. (IA), tuberculosis, or Pneumocystis jirovecii [22]. Therefore, performing a histopathologic study and culture of the resected lung to rule out these infections and to provide treatment when they are detected is extremely important. Finally, the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents before transplantation can lead to the selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains that are difficult to treat. This often occurs in recipients with CF, as discussed below.",

The state of ischemia for several hours after donor lung extraction, and reimplantation without reestablishment of the graft\u2019s lymphatic drainage and innervation clearly affect the graft\u2019s defense mechanisms. The airway mucosa is damaged, and the mechanism of mucociliary clearance is paralyzed. Anastomosis of the airway also decreases the clearance of respiratory secretions. Graft denervation eliminates the cough reflex, allowing secretions to accumulate. The interruption of lymphatic drainage prevents the immune system effector cells of the regional lymph system from reaching the lung, which in turn alters the immune response against antigens deposited in the lung [25]. Moreover, the graft\u2019s microenvironment consists of human leukocyte antigen incompatibility between the host alveolar macrophages and the donor alveolar lymphocytes [26]. Additionally, small inoculum of microorganisms extracted with the graft can produce severe pneumonia in the already immunosuppressed recipient [27].

Donor-to-host transmission of bacterial or fungal infection occurred in 15 (7.6%) LTR (Table 11-2). In our experience, 25% of donors with bacteremia and 14.1% of colonized grafts were responsible for transmitting infection. Two patients died because of transmitted infection (Table 11-2).

Gram, methenamine silver, calcofluor (for fungi identification), and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen staining; and specific cultures for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria should all be conducted [31]. The main problem is that culture results may not be available soon enough. Nevertheless, the finding of positive Gram stain or scanty purulent secretions should not be contraindications for accepting the lung for transplantation [31] because the outcome of these marginally suitable lungs is similar to that obtained with ideal grafts [32]. However, most groups consider the existence of pneumonia, aspiration of gastric juice, abundant purulent secretions that persist after bronchial washing, or the growth of filamentous fungi on a culture of fiber-optic bronchoscopy samples to be contraindications to transplantation. Since two of the authors\u2019 patients who received lungs contaminated with Aspergillus spp. developed invasive aspergillosis (IA) and died, the group excludes lungs for which calcofluor stain evidences hyphae. The heavy growth of Candida species in the donor bronchus makes these lungs risky because of the potential involvement of the vascular sutures or large vessels, which could lead to mycotic aneurysms and consequent rupture [33]; therefore, this represents a significant obstacle for accepting these organs. This is more important for heart\u2013LTR. So, the graft should be excluded if the culture is pure and highly abundant. If this is not the case, an echinocandin should be initiated immediately after transplantation.",

Other prevalent Gram-negative nosocomial bacteria include Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The period of maximum risk spans the first 3 weeks after transplantation. Nevertheless, its incidence during this interval has markedly decreased with the implementation of antibiotic prophylaxis; most cases of bacterial pneumonia now occur in the intermediate and late postoperative period. In fact, health care-associated pneumonia is more frequent than hospital-acquired pneumonia [58]. Stable, ambulatory transplant recipients after the postoperative phase can develop pneumonia from infection with microorganisms prevalent in the community (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae). Infection due to MDR bacteria is a widespread problem, especially early after the procedure in the setting of hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Its appearance is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [59]. These bacteria (e.g., MRSA, MDR P. aeruginosa or B. cepacia) may colonize the recipient before transplantation (e.g., patients with CF) or can also be acquired after surgery (e.g., MDR Acinetobacter baumannii). Our group reviewed VAP incidence, etiology, and outcome in our cohort of LTR. VAP was diagnosed in 20% of LTR. P. aeruginosa was the most frequent microorganism isolated (60% MDR), followed by Enterobacteriaceae. Mortality was significantly higher in those patients diagnosed with VAP (OR 9, CI 3.2\u201325.1, p < 0.01) [60]. In another study performed in RESITRA (Spanish Research Network for the Study of Infection in Transplantation), evaluating 85 pneumonia episodes in 236 LTR (with an incidence of 72 episodes per 100 patients-per-year), bacterial pneumonia (82.7%) was more common than fungal (14%) or viral (10.4%). Gram-negative bacilli were the etiology in 34 cases (P. aeruginosa in 14 and A. baumannii in 8). The absence of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila was noteworthy and likely due to the effect of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis [61].",

A large study observed a 12-month cumulative incidence of 5.5% of IFI with Aspergillus spp. as the leading etiology (72.7%) [74]. Aspergillus infection in LTR is manifested in several ways, including airway colonization and various forms of tracheobronchitis (simple or ulcerative, with or without pseudo-membrane formation). Colonization with Aspergillus spp. occurs in 22\u201385% of LTR at some time after transplantation [36, 75]. Without prophylaxis, the incidence of IA ranges from 13 to 26%, and the related mortality is high (41\u2013100%). With prophylaxis, the incidence of IA is 2\u20138% [75\u201377]. The incidence of tracheobronchitis is about 4\u201312% [75]. In our center, the incidence of IA and tracheobronchitis in 104 LTR given nebulized liposomal amphotericin B (n-LAB) prophylaxis was 0.9% and 1.9%, respectively. IA was classically considered a complication of the immediate post-transplant period, but a RESITRA study demonstrated that its incidence remains high after this period [76]. However, about two thirds of the episodes of ulcerative tracheobronchitis and IA occur at 6\u20139 months after transplantation.

The anastomotic site is often affected, and this can lead to suture dehiscence, severe hemorrhage, or disseminated disease, invariably being fatal. Distinguishing between asymptomatic colonization and tracheobronchitis can be difficult as clinical symptoms may be absent or attributed to a concurrent clinical process (e.g., bacterial infection, rejection). When Aspergillus spp. is isolated from respiratory samples in the first 6\u20139 months, the authors perform a bronchoscopic study to rule out pseudomembranous or ulcerative tracheobronchitis.

In cases of tracheobronchitis in single-LTR, the authors employ BAL of each lung and initiate the same treatment used for IA when selective BAL of the native lung culture is positive.

The first year is the period of highest risk for histoplasmosis as a consequence of reactivation of a latent infection, new exposure or donor-derived infection [104]. Urinary antigen appears to be a better diagnostic tool than the fungal antibody serology in LTR [105]. In patients whose explanted lung is found to have histoplasmosis, antifungal prophylaxis seems effective at preventing reactivation [105]. Coccidioidomycosis is typically acquired when patients are exposed to the desert soil of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. The most common mechanism of infection in LTR is reactivation, but donor-derived transmission has also been reported. Patients, in whom there is evidence of prior coccidioidomycosis, either radiographically or serologically, may require lifelong antifungal prophylaxis [106].",

Since most Aspergillus infections in LTR affect the respiratory tree and airway colonization by the conidia precedes the infection, nebulized AFB appears to be an attractive approach. The authors\u2019 group conducted a study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and distribution of nebulized AFB in LTR [108]. Airway concentrations of AFB after nebulization with 6 mg of AFB deoxycholate theoretically offer adequate protection. Concentrations in the alveolar lining were higher than those found in the proximal bronchial tree, but the latter were still sufficient to protect anastomoses. Additionally, distribution studies using ventilation and perfusion gammagraphy imaging with technetium-99 m-labeled AFB deoxycholate were performed. All demonstrated acceptable delivery of the agent to native lungs and allografts in amounts proportionate to their degree of ventilation. Prophylaxis with nebulized AFB decreased the incidence of IA below 3% [108]. In the authors\u2019 experience, the incidence of any kind of Aspergillus spp. infection in 226 consecutive LTR was 7.5%. However, administration of nebulized AFB every 8 h day after day is a considerable drawback. With the aim of prolonging the dosing interval, our group determined the airway concentrations of the drug after nebulization of 24 mg of the liposomal formulation (Ambisome\u00ae) [109]. We could demonstrate that AFB concentrations after n-LAB remained high enough for prophylaxis of Aspergillus spp. infection over 14 days. There was no significant systemic absorption of the drug and no effect was observed on respiratory function. Thus, the main advantages of nebulized prophylaxis are the lack of drug\u2013drug interactions, the cost-effectiveness relationship, and the ability to achieve high levels of lung antifungal concentrations without systemic side effects [109]. One disadvantage is local irritation that leads to cough or bronchospasm. These effects occur in fewer than 10% of patients. The use of salbutamol or halving the drug concentration can improve the symptoms. Other disadvantages are the need for appropriate equipment and for the patient or family members to know how to administer it. The possibility of irregular distribution of the drug in the lung is another potential limitation [110]. Voriconazole is an alternative although there is also a lack of randomized studies [111]. Moreover, an increase in liver enzymes has been observed in up to 60% of LTR receiving voriconazole leading to discontinuation of the drug in 14% of them [112]. Skin cancer has also been reported in LTR with its prolonged use [113].\n",

The most important risk factor for the development of CMV disease is CMV mismatch, which confers more than 50% risk in the absence of antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive treatment strategies [119]. However, cell-mediated immunity is known to be more important than humoral immunity in controlling CMV. CMV infection elicits a strong virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response that, currently, can be measured [120, 121]. As an example, those LTR considered negative or indeterminate to Quantiferon-CMV are at risk of developing CMV disease [115, 116]. In a trial comparing sirolimus to azathioprine, the overall incidence of any CMV event was lower in the sirolimus arm at 1 year (RR = 0.67, CI 0.55\u20130.82, p > 0.01) [122]. The relationship between CMV disease and other risk factors such as co-infection with Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) [123], hypogammaglobulinemia [124], polymorphisms in toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) [125], or low levels of mannose-binding lectin [126] has been demonstrated in other types of SOTR rather than lung. Thus, HHV-6 was not detected in 145 samples from 26 LTR, even though 30% of the samples were from 9 CMV DNA-positive patients in whom 13 episodes of CMV pneumonitis were recorded [127].\n",

The detection of CMV DNA in the BAL is associated with the development of BOS irrespective of the magnitude of viral replication, the presence of tissue invasive disease or whether viral replication is symptomatic or asymptomatic [138]. The association between augmented antiviral prophylaxis and reduced cellular rejection has been also identified in LTR [139, 140]. Although antiviral drugs adequately suppress CMV replication, LTR remain vulnerable to both clinical and subclinical CMV replication on cessation of prophylaxis that is associated with BOS. However, other studies [141] reported no increased risk of BOS in a cohort of patients with beta herpesvirus (CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7) replication within the lung allograft.",

Previous cohorts have reported an incidence of RV infections in LT in the range of 7.7\u201364% [142, 143]. Our group conducted a 5-year prospective study including 98 LTR that demonstrated an overall incidence of RV of 0.85 per patient-year. Our results are similar to data recently published in another large prospective study [144]. Seasonal patterns of RV circulating in LT are comparable to those observed in the community. Picornaviruses (mainly rhinovirus), coronaviruses, and influenza virus were the most common etiological agents, accounting for 76.5% of microbiologically confirmed symptomatic infections. Rhinoviruses are the leading cause of RV infections. Rhinovirus were associated not only with mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection but also with lower respiratory tract infection, mainly in form of tracheobronchitis. Patients with paramyxovirus (especially respiratory syncytial virus) and influenza infection had a higher incidence of pneumonia and hospitalization rate [145\u2013147]. The relationship between RV infections and acute rejection has not been clearly established in previous studies [144, 148, 149]. Our data showed a trend toward a significant clinical link between RV and biopsy-proven acute lung rejection including the acute phase of the viral infection (with no relation to clinical presentation) and a follow-up period of 3 months. It has also been advocated that patients with documented community respiratory viral pneumonitis are predisposed to high-grade BOS development [150]. Finally, RV infections have been described as a risk factor for developing bacterial and fungal superinfection [151].",

The risk for developing PTLD is higher in EBV seronegative LTR. However, late onset PTLD tends to present in seropositive recipients. Early onset PTLD involves predominantly the transplanted lung, whereas late onset PTLD does not [154].

The first is prophylaxis, in which an antiviral agent is administered immediately after transplantation to those recipients at high risk for CMV disease (e.g., D+/R\u2212 cases or patients who require the administration of conventional T-cell receptor antibodies). The second strategy, preemptive therapy, consists of the administration of an antiviral agent when nucleic acid testing (NAT) evidences a level of viral replication highly predictive of CMV disease. An international survey showed the lack of uniformity when managing with CMV infection in LT. Although prophylaxis is the most commonly used preventive strategy, its duration is extremely variable (from 3 months to indefinite). Half the centers routinely decreased immunosuppression at the time of viremia while the other half did not take any measure [156]. In an attempt to avoid this issue, guidelines have been published [157].",

The authors\u2019 recommendation is intravenous ganciclovir at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 24 h until oral intake is tolerated, followed by a switch to valganciclovir at a dose of 900 mg once a day until 180 days after transplantation for seropositive recipients and 360 days for CMV mismatch. Valganciclovir at reduced doses to avoid toxicity should not be administered due to its association with CMV disease and increased risk of emergence of resistance [158]. During prophylaxis, we do recommend monitoring of viral load by NAT due to the possibility of breakthrough disease, particularly in seronegative recipients [158]. Once prophylaxis ends, surveillance should continue at every medical visit until the second year after transplantation and preemptive therapy with valganciclovir should be initiated. Treatment is initiated in the following situations: (1) in D+/R\u2212 transplant recipients, whenever evidence of viral replication is found, and (2) in CMV-seropositive recipients, when viral load is high (e.g., >5000 UI/mL in plasma) or when an increase is registered in two consecutive analyses. When the viral load is under the established cutoff for initiation of preemptive therapy, the analyses should be repeated within 1 week. The duration of preemptive therapy has not been established, but the authors prefer a minimum of 7\u201310 days when viral replication is negative.",

Generally, tacrolimus and prednisone doses are not reduced, except in cases of pneumonitis, in which they are progressively tapered. MMF is withdrawn or the dose is halved. If ganciclovir-associated leukopenia develops and the polymorphonuclear count drops below 500 cells/mL, the patient is treated with granulocyte-stimulating factor until the polymorphonuclear count increases to more than 1000 cells/mL. In patients with pneumonitis, gammaglobulins at a dose of 200 mg/kg every 48 h are added during the first week of treatment. The viral load should be monitored, and a significant increase after the fourth or fifth day of treatment should raise the suspicion of ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection. However, an increase in viral load during the first 2 or 3 days of treatment is not infrequent.
