            "text": "Type I interferon (IFN) production can be elicited by a wide variety of stimulants, including viruses, products of bacteria, plants and fungi. Many cell types produce type I IFN following viral infection. For example, influenza virus infection of monocytes (Ronni et al., 1995), macrophages (Roberts et al., 1979) and dendritic cells (DCs) (Cella et al., 1999b) activates the production of type I IFN in these cells and Sendai virus infection has been demonstrated to induce monocytes and macrophages to release IFN (Saksela et al., 1984). It is probable that in these cells double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesized during the viral replicative cycle (Jacobs and Langland, 1996) is a trigger for type I IFN production, since synthetic dsRNA, e.g. polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), is known to be a potent inducer of type I IFN (De Clercq, 1981; Majde, 2000).",

            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), also known as natural interferon producing cells, (NIPCs), are major producers of type I IFN in response to stimulation with enveloped viruses and hence are key effectors in the innate immune system. pDCs are a rare cell population found in the peripheral blood, lymphoid organs, bone marrow, thymus, liver and lung (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2003; Blasius et al., 2004; de Heer et al., 2004; Demedts et al., 2005). In addition to their functional definition as the main type I IFN producing population in response to viruses they are defined by flow cytometry as CD11clowB220+CD11b\u2212Ly6C+ murine cells, or lineage\u2212HLA-DRhighCD11c\u2212CD123+ human cells (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001; Cella et al., 1999a; Dzionek et al., 2000; Nakano et al., 2001). More recently developed monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as 120G8, anti-mPDCA-1 and anti-BDCA-2, specific for the pDC, will ease identification of this cell type (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2003; Dzionek et al., 2000; Krug et al., 2004a). Virally stimulated pDCs can produce other cytokines in addition to type I IFN, but the mechanism of induction of the secretion of these factors is not fully understood to date (Piqueras et al., 2005).",

In earlier work, human and porcine peripheral blood leukocytes and mouse spleen cells, and more recently human and murine pDCs specifically, have been shown to produce type I IFN in response to inactivated enveloped viruses, supporting the argument for an additional replication-independent viral recognition system. This article will focus mainly on reviewing the evidence that viral glycoproteins can mediate type I IFN induction, in a mechanism which may be independent of the well-studied genome-mediated route.",

            "text": "A hitherto poorly studied issue is the search for the cellular receptors involved in viral glycoprotein recognition leading to type I IFN production. Cell surface receptors regulate a range of functions, including differentiation, growth and survival, adhesion, migration, phagocytosis, activation and cytotoxicity. Identification of viral receptors is often difficult as many mediate only low affinity binding to surface viral proteins. It has been difficult to identify the receptors specifically involved in glycoprotein-mediated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction for both this reason and due to the rarity of pDCs. Surface receptors on DCs for microbial antigens include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors and scavenger receptors. The full repertoire of surface-expressed pDC receptors remains to be elucidated, however the list is growing as researchers try to understand how this important cell type recognizes and responds to pathogens. In this review we highlight pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that bind or sense viral glycoproteins. Their expression on pDCs in particular, is not known in all cases.",

            "text": "Oligonucleotides have been proposed as type I IFN inducing ligands recognized by cytosolic and endosomal sensors in many cell types. The mechanism of discrimination between self and non-self ligands is unclear, although compartmentalization of host ligands away from these receptors has been suggested (Barton et al., 2006). Type I IFN induction by pDCs can be triggered through viral recognition via both TLR and non-TLR recognition of oligonucleotides. pDCs express high levels of TLRs 7 and 9 (Edwards et al., 2003), which have been shown to sense nucleic acids leading to type I IFN production. For example, TLR7 has been shown to mediate recognition of influenza virus genomic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (Diebold et al., 2004) and ssRNA from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (Heil et al., 2004) while TLR9 senses mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (Krug et al., 2004a; Tabeta et al., 2004). Purified ssRNA from influenza virus can stimulate bone marrow-derived DC cultures that contain pDCs to secrete IFN\u03b1; this was reduced to background levels using cells from TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice (Diebold et al., 2004). In addition, ssRNA derived from the HIV-1 genome stimulated human peripheral blood pDCs and murine bone marrow-derived pDCs to produce IFN\u03b1 in a TLR7-dependent manner (Heil et al., 2004). Similarly, it has been shown that splenic pDCs produce IFN\u03b1 in response to MCMV in a TLR9-dependent manner in experiments measuring IFN\u03b1 secretion by in vitro and in vivo stimulated murine splenic pDCs. In this report the exact viral stimulus for TLR9 was not defined, but the double-stranded DNA genome of MCMV was implicated by studies using the TLR9 agonist unmethlylated CpG DNA (Krug et al., 2004a). The in vivo relevance for TLR9 in recognizing MCMV was confirmed in the same year when Tabeta et al. (2004) showed that mice with a point mutation in TLR9, which renders this receptor insensitive to its synthetic CpG DNA agonist, have higher MCMV titers in the spleen and reduced survival compared to control mice following MCMV infection. In addition, these TLR9 mutant mice have reduced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in their serum following MCMV infection. TLR3 senses dsRNA resulting in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction, however it is not essential for IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in virally infected cells (Honda et al., 2003) and neither human nor murine pDCs express this TLR (Colonna et al., 2004; Edwards et al., 2003). This evidence suggests that TLRs can play an important, and often necessary, role in viral sensing leading to type I IFN production; however, they are only expressed in a subset of cells and other receptors also sense viral ligands.",

The cytoplasm of both innate immune cells and non-immune cells contains retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (Mda5), which sense cytosolic virus-associated dsRNA leading to type I IFN production (Yoneyama et al., 2004, Yoneyama et al., 2005). Interestingly, studies comparing pDCs from RIG-I\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice (which lack all known TLR-mediated activation signaling pathways) by Kato et al. (2005) demonstrated that the use of RIG-I or TLRs was cell type specific. While RIG-I seems to be required for IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production in several cell types, TLRs remain the key pathway for innate recognition of RNA viruses in pDCs. Hence, pDCs from RIG-I\u2212/\u2212 mice showed equivalent IFN-\u03b1 production following Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) infection to that by wild-type mice, whereas pDCs from MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice had a 4-fold reduction in IFN-\u03b1 production. These two pathways of cytosolic dsRNA detection may have complementary functions; perhaps RIG-I sensing of cytosolic dsRNA may be important for an immediate detection of viral infection while TLR sensing of dsRNA in endosomal compartments may be more important for the systemic response to virus (Benedict and Ware, 2005; Levy and Marie, 2004). Cells can also detect dsRNA through the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), which in response, inhibits host translation by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 and activates NF-\u03baB (Saunders and Barber, 2003). Whether cells also have a mechanism for cytosolic recognition of ssRNA remains to be discovered. Recently, a pathway by which the recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA leads to the production of type I IFN has been investigated in macrophages and DCs; however, the identity of the DNA sensor is not yet known, nor is whether DNA viruses may activate this pathway (Ishii et al., 2006; Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). Stetson and Medzhitov (2006) used infection by the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes as a source of cytosolic DNA, as well as DNA that lacks CpG motifs, to induce type I IFN production and this second source of DNA also induced potent induction of type I IFN when transfected into pDCs. Clearly, there is still more to learn about the cytosolic recognition of viral nucleic acids.",

This has been demonstrated using fixed cells infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (Capobianchi et al., 1985; Lebon, 1985), dengue virus (Kurane et al., 1986), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Charley and Laude, 1988), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)-4A (Ito et al., 1994); and influenza virus (Miller and Anders, 2003). These fixed virus-infected cells are thought to present arrays of viral glycoproteins at their surface, which would presumably be able to interact with receptors on the NIPC. A number of these studies also implicated specific viral glycoproteins as necessary for IFN induction since mAb specific for the viral glycoprotein could block IFN induction. For example, in experiments by Charley et al. IFN induction by fixed TGEV-infected cells could be blocked by antibodies against the M (also known as E1) surface glycoprotein of TGEV (Charley and Laude, 1988). Similarly, fixed HSV-1-infected cells induced IFN secretion by human PBMC, which was inhibited by the addition of mAb against HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein gD (Lebon, 1985). Fixed HPIV-4A-infected cells induced IFN production by mouse splenocytes and this could be inhibited by anti-HPIV-4A antiserum and mixtures of mAb against multiple epitopes on the HN glycoprotein (Ito et al., 1994). Such systems of fixed virus infected-cells presumably have few or no free virions hence their ability to induce type I IFN is thought to be a consequence of interactions between viral envelope glycoproteins expressed on the surface membrane of the infected cells and receptors on the NIPC. Alternatively the NIPC could recognize a cellular stress ligand induced upon viral infection.",

In addition, systems using inactivated virus, or even virus-infected cells, as stimuli for type I IFN induction cannot rule out that viral nucleic acid may be present and capable of triggering type I IFN production. Experiments where no viral genome is present most strongly suggest there is a genome-independent pathway of type I IFN induction, in which viral glycoproteins are recognized as the stimuli triggering IFN production. An example of this was seen when fixed insect cells transfected with the HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein gD, but not other HSV-1 glycoproteins (gB, gC, gE, gG and gI), induced strong type I IFN secretion by human PBMC (Ankel et al., 1998). IFN induction could be inhibited by mAb against gD, strengthening the argument for a role for gD in the induction of IFN\u03b1. In addition, Ito et al. showed that mouse spleen cells produced type I IFN when co-cultured with COS7 cells transfected with HPIV-4A virus HN glycoprotein, but not with COS7 transfected with vector alone (Ito et al., 1994). Thus, in the absence of any viral nucleic acid, viral glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface are sufficient for IFN induction to occur.",

In addition, soluble HN glycoprotein of HPIV-4A induced IFN production by murine splenocytes (Ito et al., 1994). Since this work was done, pDCs have emerged as a cell type found in peripheral blood and spleen which produces the majority of type I IFN in response to viral stimulation. To our knowledge only one study to date has shown direct evidence that viral glycoproteins can stimulate pDCs to secrete type I IFN.

Using genetically modified mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) in which the abundant envelope glycoprotein, M, was either O- or N-glycosylated or not glycosylated at all, de Haan et al. (2003) studied the influence of M protein glycosylation on the IFN inducing capacity of the virus. In this study, the differentially glycosylated M proteins were all expressed at similar levels on fixed cells infected with MHV, however, IFN induction by peripheral blood lymphocytes incubated with these infected cells was inhibited 30\u2013200-fold if virus lacked all glycosylation of its M glycoprotein. In addition, cells infected with mutant TGEV expressing partially or totally deglycosylated M were reduced in their ability to induce type I IFN production by PBMC in comparison with the parental virus, which again, suggested that glycosylation may be important in the induction of IFN (Laude et al., 1992). In a system of type I IFN induction in murine splenocytes by inactivated influenza virus where the main cell producing type I IFN was the pDC, mannan, known to block recognition of ligands by receptors with specificity for mannose, such as mannose receptor and DC-SIGN, inhibited the induction of IFN by inactivated influenza virus ((Miller and Anders, 2003) and unpublished data R.S and J.M).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein is an example of a viral envelope glycoprotein which can be sensed by TLR4 and CD14 (Kurt-Jones et al., 2000). F protein can induce IL-6 secretion from purified human monocytes in a manner that could be blocked by anti-CD14 mAb. In addition, F protein could not stimulate macrophages from CD14\u2212/\u2212 or TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice to produce IL-6. The envelope proteins of murine retroviruses also activate TLR4 (Rassa et al., 2002). Similarly, TLR2 and CD14 can recognize an undefined human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) structure, likely to be an envelope glycoprotein (Compton et al., 2003). HCMV dense bodies (which contain envelope and tegument, but lack capsid and nucleic acid) can induce human PBMC to secrete IL-8 and IL-6 in a manner that could be inhibited by antibodies against CD14. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with TLR2 produced IL-8 in response to inactivated virus and inactivated HCMV could stimulate NF-\u03baB driven reporter gene expression in these cells. The levels of IL-8 secreted and NF-\u03baB driven gene expression by TLR2 expressing HEK were enhanced when CD14 was co-expressed. In addition, thioglycolate-elicited macrophages from TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice did not secrete IL-6 in response to HCMV. The haemagglutinin (H) protein of measles virus wild-type strains also triggers TLR2 activation in a way that is enhanced by CD14 expression but independent of the measles virus receptors CD46 and CD150 (Bieback et al., 2002). This demonstrates that TLRs can sense not only viral genome, but also viral glycoproteins leading to responses including cytokine secretion. It is interesting to note that in much of the work implicating viral nucleic acid as being sensed by the TLR, viral glycoprotein is also present.",

            "text": "A number of C-type lectin receptors, including DC-SIGN, Langerin and the mannose receptor (MR) are important for the binding of HIV-1 envelope proteins to epithelial DCs and macrophages which express these molecules (Turville et al., 2003). The extent of glycosylation of gp120 allows HIV-1 to bind to at least three different C-type lectin receptors on cells within the stratified squamous epithelium in what is often a mannose-specific manner (Turville et al., 2002). HIV-1 whole virus particle binding to monocyte-derived macrophages can be inhibited by mannan, EDTA, d-mannose or mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (Nguyen and Hildreth, 2003) and binding of gp120 to some DC subsets can be inhibited by mannan (Turville et al., 2002). In addition gp120 also binds to an astroglial cell line expressing MR more than an untransfected control and this can be inhibited by deglycosylation of gp120 and addition of EGTA (Liu et al., 2004). A functional role for MR in HIV-1 infection is suggested by findings that expression of MR in astroglial cells increased their infectivity by HIV-1. This effect could be inhibited by anti-MR serum, mannan and mannose. In the same way the infection of primary human astrocytes by HIV-1 was inhibited by anti-MR serum and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MR. Together this research defines a mannose-dependent binding mechanism of HIV-1 to some cell types and suggests a role for MR in infection. Interestingly, MR has also been reported as being important for the induction of IFN\u03b1 in response to several viruses including HIV-1 (Milone and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1998).",

In another example, a cell line expressing either DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR bound more beads coated with gp120 of HIV-1 than the untransfected control. This binding could be partially inhibited by Fab fragments against DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR (Dakappagari et al., 2006) or anti-DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR mAb, mannan and EDTA (Bashirova et al., 2001).

SP-A and MBL bind influenza virus and can inhibit the haemagglutination activity of influenza virus (Malhotra et al., 1994). Collectins are soluble proteins thought to opsonise viral particles to aid their uptake by phagocytes though binding to a cellular receptor. The binding of SP-D, SP-A and MBL to influenza virus demonstrates the recognition of viral carbohydrate by soluble PRR; this could bring the virus particle closer to an innate immune cell and by clustering cellular receptors could initiate signaling.",
