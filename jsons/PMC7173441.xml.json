Virus receptors on cell surfaces may be proteins (usually glycoproteins) or carbohydrate residues present on glycoproteins or glycolipids. Some complex viruses (e.g., in the Poxviridae or Herpesviridae) use more than one receptor and therefore have alternative routes of uptake into cells. Most bacteriophage receptors are on the bacterial cell wall, although certain phages use cellular appendages (pili, flagella) as primary adsorption sites. Attachment is an automatic docking process and the kinetics of receptor binding are controlled by the chemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the molecules involved, that is, their relative concentrations and availability.",

The attachment phase of infection therefore has a major influence on viral pathogenesis and in determining the course of a virus infection. Plant viruses must overcome different problems to animal viruses in initiating infection. The outer surfaces of plants are composed of protective layers of waxes and pectin, and each cell is surrounded by a thick wall of cellulose overlying the cytoplasmic membrane. No known plant virus uses a specific cellular receptor of the type that animal and bacterial viruses use to attach to cells and plant viruses must rely on mechanical breaks in the cell wall to directly introduce a virus particle into a cell.",

An example of this is human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), the primary receptor for which is the T-cell antigen, CD4. The binding site for the HIV-1 attachment protein (antireceptor), gp 120, has been mapped to the first variable region of CD4, although additional amino acids of the second variable domain also contribute toward binding. The sequences important for CD4 binding have also been mapped in gp120. Deletions in this region or site substitutions abolish CD4 binding. In addition to CD4, there is at least one accessory factor which is necessary to form a functional HIV-1 receptor. These factors have now been identified as a family of proteins known as \u03b2-chemokine receptors. Multiple members of this class of proteins have been shown to play a role in the entry of HIV-1 into cells, and their distribution in the body is the primary control for the tropism of HIV-1 for different cell types.",

Virus particles may be taken up by cells by pinocytosis or phagocytosis. However, without some form of physical interaction which holds the virus particle in close association with the cell surface, the frequency of these events would be very low. In addition, the fate of viruses absorbed into endocytic vacuoles is usually to be degraded, except in cases where the virus particle enters cells by this route. On occasion, binding of antibody-coated virus particles to Fc receptor molecules on the surface of monocytes and other blood cells can result in virus uptake. The presence of antiviral antibodies can result in increased virus uptake by cells and increased pathogenicity, rather than virus neutralization, as would normally be expected. The significance of such mechanisms in vivo is not known.",

Unlike attachment, cell entry is generally an energy-dependent process, that is, the cell must be metabolically active for this to occur. Three main mechanisms are observed:1.Translocation of the entire virus particle across the cytoplasmic membrane of the cell. This process is relatively rare among viruses and is poorly understood. It is mediated by proteins in the virus capsid and specific membrane receptors.2.Endocytosis of the virus into intracellular vacuoles. This is probably the most common mechanism of virus entry into cells. It does not require any specific virus proteins (other than those already utilized for receptor binding) but relies on the normal formation and internalization of coated pits (term to be explained) at the cell membrane. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an efficient process for taking up and concentrating extracellular macromolecules.3.Fusion of the virus envelope (where present) with the cell membrane, either directly at the cell surface or following endocytosis in a cytoplasmic vesicle. Fusion requires the presence of a specific fusion protein in the virus envelope, for example, influenza A virus hemagglutinin or the transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses. These proteins promote the joining of the cellular and virus membranes which results in the nucleocapsid being deposited directly in the cytoplasm. There are two types of virus-driven membrane fusions: pH-dependent and pH-independent.\n",

At this point, any virus contained within these structures is still cut off from the cytoplasm by a lipid bilayer and therefore has not strictly entered the cell. As endosomes fuse with lysosomes, the environment inside these vessels becomes progressively more hostile as they are acidified and the pH falls, while the concentration of degradative enzymes rises. This means that the virus must leave the vesicle and enter the cytoplasm before it is degraded. There are a number of mechanisms by which this occurs, including membrane fusion and rescue by transcytosis. The release of virus particles from endosomes and their passage into the cytoplasm is intimately connected with (and often impossible to separate from) the process of uncoating.",

Uncoating may occur inside endosomes, being triggered by the change in pH as the endosome is acidified, or directly in the cytoplasm. Entry into the endocytic pathway is a hazardous process for viruses because if they remain in the vesicle too long, they will be irreversibly damaged by low pH or lysosomal enzymes. Hence, some viruses have evolved proteins to control this process; for example, the influenza A virus M2 protein is a membrane channel which allows entry of hydrogen ions into the nucleocapsid, facilitating uncoating. The M2 protein is multifunctional, and also has a role in virus uncoating. In the picornaviruses, penetration of the cytoplasm by exit of virus from endosomes is tightly linked to uncoating. The acidic environment of the endosome causes a conformational change in the particle at around pH 5 that reveals hydrophobic domains not present on the surface of mature virus capsids. These hydrophobic patches interact with the endosomal membrane and form pores through which the RNA genome passes into the cytoplasm of the host cell.",

In other cases, the virus core which remains is highly complex; for example, in the poxviruses uncoating occurs in two stages \u2013 removal of the outer membrane as the particle enters the cell and in the cytoplasm, followed by further uncoating as the core passes into the cytoplasm. In this case, the core still contains dozens of proteins and at least 10 distinct enzymes.",

Eukaryotic viruses which replicate in the nucleus, such as members of the Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, and Polyomaviridae, undergo structural changes following penetration, but overall remain largely intact. This is important because these capsids contain nuclear localization sequences responsible for attachment to the cytoskeleton and this interaction allows the transport of the entire capsid to the nucleus.

Many viruses achieve high levels of newly synthesized structural components by concentrating these into subcellular compartments known as inclusion bodies.

Moreover, they are often further controlled by being packaged into virus particles during assembly and only activated when brought into close contact with their target sequence by the conformation of the capsid, for example, by being placed in a local hydrophobic environment, or by changes of pH or cation cofactor concentrations inside the particle as it forms. Retrovirus proteases are good examples of enzymes involved in maturation which are under tight control. The retrovirus core particle is composed of proteins from the gag gene and the protease is packaged into the core before its release from the cell on budding. During the budding process, the protease cleaves the gag protein precursors into the mature products \u2013 the capsid, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins of the mature virus particle.

The release of mature virus particles from their host cells by budding presents a problem in that these particles are designed to enter, rather than leave, cells. Certain virus envelope proteins are involved in the release phase of replication as well as in receptor binding. The best-known example of this is the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus. In addition to being able to reverse the attachment of virus particles to cells via hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is also believed to be important in preventing the aggregation of influenza A virus particles and may well have a role in virus release. In addition to using specific proteins, viruses which bud have also solved the problem of release by the careful timing of the assembly-maturation-release pathway.
