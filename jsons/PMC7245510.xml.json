            "text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) originates from the transformation and clonal expansion of undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitors, characterized by altered growth, differentiation, and proliferation capacities, which result in failure of bone marrow hematopoietic functions. Although a majority of AML patients initially respond to standard induction therapy, a protocol that combines cytarabine (AraC) with an anthracycline, relapses are common and overall survival remains very poor [1]. Whole-genome sequencing analyses have highlighted the molecular heterogeneity of AML and allow for risk-based stratification [2]. For some mutations resulting in oncogenic signaling, specific inhibitors have been developed and are included in clinical strategies [3, 4]. Unfortunately, in the majority of cases these strategies show only transient and limited efficacy due to a variety of resistance mechanisms that occur in minor subpopulations of resistant leukemic cells which can initiate relapse [5]. Consequently, identification of these resistance mechanisms and new potential drug targets is urgently needed in AML.",

            "text": "Ubiquitylation is an essential post-translational modification involved in protein stability, localization, interactions, and activity. This process is closely regulated, antagonized by cysteine protease deubiquitinating enzymes (or DUBs), and is involved in multiple signaling [6]. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7, also known as herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease, or HAUSP) belongs to the largest subfamily of DUB and is one of the most studied, disease-associated DUBs [7]. It has been noted that USP7 participates in the regulation of apoptosis and senescence by modulating the p53 pathway, either by directly deubiquitinating p53 or by stabilizing MDM2, an E3-ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and targets p53 for proteasomal degradation [8]. Independently of its action on p53, USP7 modulates various pathways in homeostasis or during oncogenesis by targeting a large panel of substrates involved in cell cycle, DNA damage response, immune response, signal transduction, neuronal differentiation, and epigenetic regulation [7, 9]. Other notable targets of USP7 include the tumor suppressor PTEN [10] and the transcription factor FOXO4 [11]. Through deubiquitination, USP7 triggers their nuclear exclusion and inactivation. Interestingly, in chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL phosphorylates USP7 and enhances its deubiquitinating activity on PTEN [12]. Therefore, it is evident that USP7 is at the center of a complex network, and recent efforts have focused on the discovery and development of small molecule inhibitors of this protein [13\u201319]. These inhibitors were found to enhance apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [20] and multiple myeloma [21] and to reduce neuroblastoma growth in vivo [22]. In this context, we hypothesize that a possible dysregulation of USP7 may contribute to resistance in AML.",

Furthermore, our results demonstrate that USP7 expression is a predictive marker of resistance to chemotherapy in AML. We also report that USP7 is a major regulator of CHK1 protein in AML through its deubiquitinating activity, which leads to CHK1 stabilization. Finally, we found that USP7 inhibition potentiates cytarabine (AraC) treatment by increasing leukemic cell death, and independently of p53 status. Altogether, these results suggest that targeting USP7 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in AML.",

Engraftment efficiency was monitored in peripheral blood by flow cytometry analysis of human CD45+ and CD33+ positive cells at 22 weeks after xenotransplantation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2A) before starting treatment and for cohort randomization. Mice showing at least 20 AML human blasts per microliter of peripheral blood were assigned to experimental groups in order to obtain balanced average engraftment levels in each cohort at the initiation of therapy (Fig. 2c). PDX mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection with 15 mg/kg P22077, three times per week for 2 weeks and daily for 1 week (Fig. 2b). After 3 weeks of treatment, a significant reduction in total tumor burden in bone marrow and spleen was observed in USP7 inhibitor-treated versus untreated mice (Fig. 2d). In addition, a significant reduction in spleen size was monitored in USP7 inhibitor-treated mice compared with untreated mice (Fig. 2e, f). It is important to note that P22077 was used at a well-tolerated dose, which was monitored by mouse body weight and the viability of normal hematopoietic cells in murine bone marrow (Fig. 2g, h). Otherwise, the USP7 inhibitor does not affect normal hematopoietic murine cells in the spleen, as determined by the number of CD45.1-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B).",

We also found that USP7 expression seems to correlate with FLT3-ITD mutation.

Consequently, we investigated the impact of FLT3-ITD on USP7 abundance in two human FLT3-ITD-positive cell lines, MOLM-14 and MV4-11. Pharmacological inhibition of FLT3 activity in these leukemic cells with AC220 (quizartinib), a specific FLT3 inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with relapse/refractory FLT3-ITD AML, by 2, 6 or 24 h incubation was not followed by a significant decrease in USP7 level (Supplementary Fig. 3B).",

We found that USP7 transcript abundance and USP7 protein levels were highly correlated (R = 0.8073, **P = 0.0085) (Fig. 3b). We then defined a USP7-specific gene signature (41 genes upregulated, Supplementary Table 1) from The Cancer Genome Atlas transcriptomic database [25], and found that this signature is highly enriched in the transcriptome of AML patient samples at relapse (HACKL cohort, GEO: GSE66525 [27]) (Fig. 3c). We also observed a similar enrichment in transcriptomes of cytarabine-resistant human AML cells purified from PDX models treated with clinically relevant doses of cytarabine (GEO: GSE97631 [28]) (Fig. 3d). These data highlight a correlation between high USP7 transcriptomic signature, AML cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and relapse.

Based on the difference in their gene expression, we identified two distinct transcriptional clusters of cells at diagnosis and relapse (Fig. 3f), and observed that at relapse, the decrease was striking in cluster 2 compared with cluster 1 (Fig. 3f, right panel), which implies that the signature of cluster 1 corresponds to the gene signature of the chemoresistant cells in this patient. Interrogation of two public transcriptomic datasets established on diagnosis of AML patients (TCGA Network [25], and Verhaak database GSE6891 [26]) revealed that this chemoresistant gene signature was enriched in AML samples with high USP7 abundance (Fig. 3g, h). USP7 protein abundance was high in primary cells from these patients (Supplementary Fig. 3C), which is consistent with the data described above. These data strongly suggest that high USP7 levels are associated with chemoresistance in AML cells, and with the initiation of relapse following standard chemotherapy treatment. Overall, these data reveal that this high USP7 signature is a predictive marker of resistance and relapse in AML cells.",

Endogenous CHK1 was then immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with CHK1 and HA-antibodies. The HA-ubiquitin signal present in immunoprecipitated CHK1 was higher when USP7 was silenced (Fig. 5d, and Supplementary Fig. 4B). To further support this observation, endogenous CHK1 was immunoprecipitated from HL-60 cells treated with P22077 in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. These fractions were immunoblotted and probed with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The results indicate that CHK1 was more abundantly ubiquitinated following USP7 inhibition compared with the control, which suggests that USP7 is a negative regulator of CHK1 ubiquitination (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results indicate that USP7 is an important mediator of CHK1 deubiquitination in leukemic cells.",

Using immunofluorescence, we also confirmed that ~50% of the CHK1 protein signal disappears after 24 h of USP7 inhibition, without any changes in CHK1 subcellular localization (Supplementary Fig. 4E).

Based on the median expression of USP7 protein, we separated this cohort into two groups of high USP7 and low USP7 expressing samples. Leukemic cells with high USP7 levels (Fig. 6c) tended to be more resistant to cytarabine compared with cells that expressed lower levels of USP7 (Fig. 6d), which is consistent with our transcriptomics analyses (Fig. 3). It is striking to note that USP7 inhibition potentiated the effects of cytarabine in cells that expressed high levels of USP7, leading to reduced colony formation, while it did not modify the sensitivity to cytarabine of cells that expressed low levels of USP7. Our results indicate that P22077 significantly enhances the cytotoxic effect of cytarabine on leukemic cells by reducing their colony-forming potential. In order to determine whether USP7 participates in the chemoresistance of leukemic cells by modulation of CHK1 stability, we then monitored the CHK1/USP7 association by PLA in AML cells treated with cytarabine. A significant increase in the proximity between the two proteins was visualized in cytarabine-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 6e, f). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by using a USP7 inhibitor (P22077) that induced a significant decrease in CHK1 protein level (Supplementary Fig. 4E), dramatically reducing the number of PLA dots per cell (Fig. 6e, f). Similar results were obtained with the combination of cytarabine and P22077. Altogether, these data suggest that USP7 plays a role in promoting CHK1 stability in response to DNA-damaging treatment.",

            "text": "Finally, to further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, we explored the contribution of this USP7/CHK1 axis in the DNA replication fork progression in AML cells. We used the DNA fiber spreading assay for this purpose, in keeping with previous reports that clearly documented the role of USP7 or CHK1 in the DNA replication process [24, 33, 34]. HL-60 cells were cultured in the presence of a USP7 inhibitor (P22077), a CHK1 inhibitor (SCH900776), or a combination of both for 16 h, then the thymidine analogs CldU and IdU were sequentially pulsed for an equal amount of time (20 min each) resulting in the labeling of nascent DNA tracks in vivo. With this method, we monitored replication fork progression as indicated by the presence of nascent DNA at the level of individual replicating DNA molecules. A reduction in nascent DNA track length is indicative of stalled DNA replication. USP7 or CHK1 inhibition led to a significant and similar reduction in the rate of ongoing replication forks in HL-60 cells (Fig. 6h). Interestingly, concomitant inhibition of CHK1 and USP7 did not further increase the replication fork blockage, which supports the hypothesis that USP7 and CHK1 are in the same signaling pathway of DNA replication progression in HL-60 cells.",

            "text": "Recent studies have reported that the USP7 level is elevated in several types of tumors, and that USP7 overexpression is often predictive of a poor prognosis [9, 32, 35, 36]. Several studies consequently suggested USP7 as an attractive pharmaceutical target for various cancers, and pharmacological inhibitors of this enzyme have recently been developed [9, 13\u201319]. In this study, we showed that USP7 plays a key role in AML chemoresistance. Furthermore, we observed heterogeneous USP7 levels in AML cell lines and primary samples and established that patients with a high USP7 signature were more prone to chemoresistance and relapse. Experiments using single-cell analysis support these findings by showing that the resistant gene signature is enriched in AML samples that exhibit high USP7 levels, which reveals that this chemoresistant cell population pre-exists at diagnosis and is enriched following first line treatment. Consequently, these data suggest that USP7 could be a new prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for AML. Our finding that USP7 inhibition in vitro and in vivo significantly suppresses leukemic cell growth, alone and in combination with chemotherapy, independently of p53 status supports this notion. Although p53 can be stabilized by USP7 [8], it appears that in AML, which does not frequently present p53 mutations, cells do not rely on p53 stabilization. Despite the large spectrum of USP7 substrates, we showed that the cytotoxic effect caused by USP7 inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by a decrease in CHK1 function due to similar anti-leukemic effects with the CHK1 inhibitor SCH900776. Our data clearly demonstrate that the USP7/CHK1 axis plays an important part in DNA replication progression and leukemic proliferation and survival. Based on our recent study in which we showed that high CHK1 protein levels contribute to cellular resistance to cytarabine, in part by facilitating fork progression or stalled fork restart [24], and based on the present results, we now suggest that high CHK1 levels, stabilized by USP7, allow cells to survive by enabling them to adapt to DNA replication stress induced by cytarabine treatment. Therefore, we believe that dysregulation of a USP7/CHK1 axis may be a new \u201cAchilles heel\u201d in AML cells. In fact, USP7 inhibition has a profound impact on proliferation and viability in leukemic cells that express high USP7 levels compared with cells that express low USP7 levels, or in PBMC. This characteristic could provide a useful therapeutic window through which this class of inhibitors could be proposed for clinical trials.",

            "text": "Although we documented the heterogeneity of USP7 abundance in primary AML samples, the mechanisms by which USP7 protein and mRNA expressions are controlled in leukemic cells remain to be defined. It will be important to investigate the mechanisms that control USP7 expression in the context of AML heterogeneity. In-depth analyses of the clinical and biological characteristics of AML patients revealed that USP7 expression significantly correlates with FLT3-ITD mutation. However, in our studies, we did not observe direct regulation of USP7 expression by the FLT3 tyrosine-kinase receptor, but this specific aspect will require further investigations in the future. Nevertheless, we established that USP7 transcript and protein abundance are highly correlated in AML samples, which suggests that the majority of USP7 regulation might occur at the transcriptional level. Previous reports have documented the transcriptional regulation of USP7, for instance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in which the transcription factor NOTCH1 induces USP7 gene expression, and where USP7 controls the stability of NOTCH1 and the JMJD3 histone demethylase through a positive regulatory loop [37, 38]. It is noteworthy that the NOTCH-signaling pathway has been reported to play oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions in the hematopoietic system, although the biological and clinical relevance remains unclear in AML [39]. A potential regulatory and functional link between USP7 and NOTCH1 is supported by our transcriptomic analyses considering that Delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1) was upregulated in cells enriched in USP7 gene signature. DLK1 encodes the NOTCH activator Delta1 which is involved in primary and model AML cell growth [40]. Furthermore, previous analyses show a significantly shorter survival of patients with high NOTCH1 or Delta1 expression, suggesting that activation of the NOTCH pathway may be associated with a poor prognosis in AML [41, 42]. All these studies, combined with our data, suggest the existence of a NOTCH/USP7/CHK1 axis involved in AML chemoresistance, which should be investigated in future studies.",

For statistical analyses, an unpaired Wilcoxon test was used. *P \u2264 0.05, and ns not significant. e Proximity ligation assays were performed using anti-CHK1 and anti-USP7 antibodies in HL-60 cells treated with 10 \u00b5M of P22077 and/or 300 nM of cytarabine for 16 h. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Z-stack images were acquired by confocal microscopy. f Quantification of PLA foci from three independent experiments was performed with ZEN and ImageJ software. For co-staining of CHK1 and USP7: mean = 1.07 \u00b1 0.07 foci/cell from 677 nuclei analyzed for the untreated condition (NT); mean = 3.31 \u00b1 0.21 foci/cell from 743 nuclei analyzed for cytarabine treatment; mean=0.68 \u00b1 0.04 foci/cell from 604 nuclei analyzed for P22077 treatment and mean = 1.24 \u00b1 0.10 foci/cell from 407 nuclei analyzed for combined treatment. P-values were determined using the unpaired t-test, ****P < 0.0001. g HL-60 cells were treated with the indicated treatment for 24 h. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry with annexinV/cell viability staining using a MACSQuant VYB flow cytometer and FlowJo software. Statistical analysis was established by unpaired t-test (n = 4). *P \u2264 0.05 and **P \u2264 0.01. In parallel, cellular extracts were collected and expression of the indicated proteins was assessed by western blotting (see under the graph). A representative western blot is presented and ratios for CHK1 protein level normalized to actin loading control are indicated below. h DNA fiber assay analysis showing iododeoxyuridine (IdU) track length (\u03bcm). HL-60 cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M of P22077 or 1 \u03bcM SCH900776 or the combined treatment for 16 h and were then labeled with CldU and IdU for 20 min. Mean (\u00b1SD) track lengths. Data are based on two independent experiments and a total of 260 (NT; mean = 14.34 \u00b1 2.50), 299 (P22077; mean = 8.81 \u00b1 2.87), 278 (SCH900776; mean = 8.99 \u00b1 2.30) and 215 (combined treatment; mean = 9.16 \u00b1 2.54) fibers were scored. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t-test with the Welch\u2019s correction, ****P < 0.00001.",
