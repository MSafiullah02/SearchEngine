Besides this, there are additional risk factors for contracting COVID illness that include old age, hypertension, diabetes, cerebral vascular disease, cardiovascular disease [2] . Thus elderly patients with age more than 50 years or those with additional risk factors should undergo additional investigations in the form of differential leucocytes count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, coagulation profiles, and computed tomography of the chest [2] . While the blood investigations can predict a subclinical infection, the CT chest findings may pick early changes that although not specific to COVID can alert the surgeon for the need for further evaluation and need for COVID specific testing [9] . To reiterate, the surgery should be delayed as much as possible considering the risk of exacerbation of subclinical COVID illness or the associated comorbidities [8] . undoubtedly been a renewed surge in alternative forms of orthopedic management like conservative treatment. However, we are yet to formulate any concrete guidelines to deal with preoperative patients and perioperative strategy.
