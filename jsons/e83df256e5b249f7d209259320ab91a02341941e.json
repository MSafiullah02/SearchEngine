A survey performed by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology found that nearly half of all responding US healthcare facilities were nearly or completely out of N95 respirators as of late March 2020. 2 As a result, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has encouraged conservation strategies to help prolong the existing supplies of N95 respirators. 3 In parallel, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is granting Emergency Use Authorizations to expand use of sterilization technologies to disinfect N95 respirators and mitigate the impact of these shortages. 4 During previous pandemics as well as the current COVID-19 pandemic, disinfection processes of N95 respirators have been developed with encouraging results. 5, 6 Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) are two disinfection methods that have shown promise. Both methods are associated with minimal to no impact on the N95 filtration mechanism or fit properties. 7, 8, 9 While significant reductions in viral load on N95 respirators have been shown with UVGI, disinfection of straps may be incomplete. 10 Furthermore, a significant amount of time is needed to set up the N95 respirator to ensure adequate exposure of all surfaces to UV-C light for disinfection. 6 Currently, the only disinfection processes for N95 respirators approved by the FDA use VHP. 4 Healthcare was assembled to implement a program to disinfect N95 respirators using VHP.",

Once a VHP disinfection process was designed, select hospital departments participated in a pilot program to further optimize the operational specifics of N95 respirator collection, transport, and handling. The multidisciplinary team developed a process that facilitated return of the disinfected N95 respirator to the original healthcare worker. This not only maximized employee acceptance, but alleviated concerns that repeated adjustment of an N95 respirator to conform to different face shapes would compromise fit. It also allowed the disinfection process to proceed without completely restricting healthcare workers from wearing cosmetics or lotions. The process map for VHP disinfection at BJH and WUSM is illustrated in ",

The N95 respirator is placed into a Tyvek pouch (Crosstex, Rochester, New York) and sealed using the self-sealing adhesive strip. The Tyvek pouch is labeled with the healthcare worker's employee identification number or name, hospital, department, and the unit location ( Figure 3A ). Next, the pouch with one N95 respirator is placed in a soiled collection bin within the unit soiled utility room. Soiled collection bins for N95 respirator pickup are available on designated medicine/surgery floors and COVID intensive care units, as well as in the emergency department, the respiratory therapy administrative office, and each of five suites of operating rooms ( Figure 3B ). Every twelve hours (starting at 7:30 am and 7:30 pm), a VHP associate, wearing appropriate PPE, follows a designated route through the hospital to collect the soiled collection bins from each designated unit's soiled utility room. At the time of collection, the VHP associate inspects each Tyvek pouch to ensure it has been correctly labeled and sealed. The soiled collection bin is closed and secured, and the exterior of the bin is disinfected. The time of the pickup is recorded in a daily log and all of the pouches are transported to the VHP room.",

Key considerations in selecting a site to house the program included an existing footprint large enough to accommodate these four areas with ready access to hand hygiene and eye wash stations. The drop ceiling tiles were replaced with non-porous sealed ceiling tiles. Lastly, the ducts for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system were sealed off to prevent the potential for VHP to leak into other adjacent ",

Beginning at two hours from the start of offgassing, ambient room H 2 O 2 PPM is measured using a second H 2 O 2 sensor (Bioquell, Horsham, Pennsylvania). If the reading is above 0 PPM, then it is rechecked every 30 minutes until there is a reading of 0 PPM. Once the initial reading is 0 PPM, then a random Tyvek pouch is selected from the middle of a shelf. An H 2 O 2 sensor is inserted by opening the corner of the pouch containing an N95 respirator to measure the H 2 O 2 level within. The corner of the Tyvek pouch is then re-sealed. If the reading is above 0 PPM, then the H 2 O 2 level is rechecked every 30 minutes until a reading of 0 PPM is achieved. This process is repeated until monitoring reveals 0 PPM on the first reading from the H 2 O 2 sensor from a newly, partially opened Tyvek bag with a single N95 respirator.",

The Tyvek pouches were chosen over paper bags as the latter absorbed more H 2 0 2 and required a longer time for off-gassing. Next, the impact of pouch placement on disinfection effectiveness was evaluated by packing some pouches tightly against one another and others loosely. Biological Tyvek pouches with one N95 respirator in each pouch. In transitioning the position to flat, each disinfection cycle was reduced to approximately 750 Tyvek pouches. By incorporating additional shelves to each wire rack, each disinfection cycle is now capable of processing 1500 Tyvek pouches.",

To further lower off-gassing time in the aeration room, a charcoal filter was added to facilitate rapid absorption of the VHP.

With continued success, the team expanded N95 respirator disinfection to other BJH healthcare providers in all perioperative areas, radiology, and labor & delivery. N95 respirator disinfection was extended beyond BJH to two other hospitals within BJC Healthcare on April 15, 2020. With the continued expansion, approximately 200 N95 respirators are undergoing VHP disinfection per cycle in the setting of a VHP room with significantly higher capabilities. Therefore, BJC Healthcare continues to expand the VHP disinfection service to healthcare providers at other member hospitals. To meet increasing demands, a second VHP room has been built with the same capability.",

The VHP room is set up with wire racks (47-inch width, 18-inch depth, and 76-inch height) spaced evenly apart and six inches from the wall. The Bioquell Z-2 (Bioquell, Horsham, Pennsylvania), two Bioquell aeration units, and a fan sit in the center of the VHP room. The soiled N95 respirator collection bins are staged onto wire racks in the soiled utility area. Tyvek pouches containing N95 respirators awaiting disinfection are retrieved from the soiled utility area and placed on shelving racks in a single layer and staggered apart. This is performed to ensure that departments and units stay together, and the Tyvek surface of each pouch is facing upwards.DisinfectionOnce the door to the VHP room is closed and sealed off, the Bioquell Z-2 disinfection cycle is started (initial settings are 20 degrees Celsius [ o C], 40% relative humidity, 10 grams per unit volume H 2 O 2 , Bioquell, Horsham, PA), lasting 4.5 hours to achieve at least 700 parts per million (PPM) of VHP.5 The cycle includes conditioning, gassing, dwell, and aeration of the H 2 O 2 .11 The disinfection cycle is run by WUSM staff, trained in the VHP system. During the pilot phaseof the program, biological indicators (Geobacillus Stearothermophilus, Mesa Labs, Boseman, Montana) were placed inside the VHP room and in a representative sample of Tyvek pouches, to validate and monitor quality of VHP disinfection. Following each disinfection cycle, biological indicators were placed into commercially-available trypticase soy broth (TSB) with a color indicator (Mesa Labs, Boseman, Montana and Steris, Mentor, Ohio) and incubated at 56 o C for at least 24 hours. A negative result indicated a successful disinfection cycle. In the event of a positive result, subsequent disinfection cycles were postponed until the VHP process was reevaluated, optimized, and validated with subsequent negative biological indicators.",

Finally, the orientation of each pouch was assessed after the first large-volume cycle yielded a positive biological indicator related to positioning of the Tyvek pouches. The orientation of each Tyvek pouch was changed from tightly packed standing on the side to a flat position with the largest area of the pouch facing upward. This allowed for maximum exposure of the Tyvek pouch to VHP. The change in orientation of the Tyvek pouch decreased the number of N95 respirators that could be decontaminated during each cycle, but this change led to higher quality disinfection as evidenced by consistently negative biological indicators. Initially, each disinfection cycle was capable of processing approximately 4,500",
