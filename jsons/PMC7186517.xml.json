At initiation of symptoms he was prescribed Tamiflu at the Urgent care center but his symptomatology worsened. Denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, and chest pain. The patient had no identifiable exposure to sick contacts nor recent travel outside the USA. The physical exam was significant for Temperature of 40C, Heart Rate 122 Respiratory rate 18 Blood pressure of 128/75 O2Sat:93% at room air, mild expiratory wheezing in bilateral lung fields. O2 via nasal cannula was started, a Respiratory Pathogen (RP) panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) and a SARS-CoV-2 test (CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for use under a Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Emergency Use authorization approved 2/4/2020) were performed on nasopharyngeal swab specimens of both nostrils, chest X-ray (Fig. 1), blood culture, CBC where ordered. Patient started on Ceftriaxone 1 g IV onetime, Azithromycin 500 mg PO onetime empirically, albuterol nebulizer. Lab work was only positive for parainfluenza virus 4, with the SARS-CoV-2 test pending at that time. Fever subsided and O2 saturation and wheezing improved. The patient was educated on diagnosis counseled on following up if symptoms persisted, cessation of drugs and self-isolation; discharged on Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID, Albuterol inhaler, Ibuprofen 800 mg PO as needed.",
