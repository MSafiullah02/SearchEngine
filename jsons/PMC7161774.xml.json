The specific molecular function of TRIM22 has not yet been elucidated, but TRIM22 has been shown to be involved in repression of viral replication (Barr et al., 2008; Bouazzaoui et al., 2006; Eldin et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009; Kajaste\u2010Rudnitski et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011).

PML has been shown to inhibit protein translation, and to induce cell cycle arrest, cell death and viral restriction (Salomoni et al., 2008). The translational regulatory activity of PML is mediated through its interaction with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)4E. When binding to eIF4E, PML induces a conformational change, resulting in a 100\u2010fold reduction in the cap\u2010binding affinity of eIF4E (von der Haar et al., 2004). This gives PML the ability to repress eIF4E\u2010mediated mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as well as to repress translation initiation in the cytoplasm (Culjkovic et al., 2006; Kentsis et al., 2001). eIF4E\u2010binding proteins generally interact with eIF4E through the YXXXL\u03a6 motif (where X is any residue and \u03a6 is leucine, methionine or phenylalanine) (Sonenberg and Gingras, 1998). However, PML does not contain this motif but instead binds to eIF4E through its RING domain (Cohen et al., 2001).",

These mRNAs are often described as \u2018weak\u2019 mRNAs, and have a more complex secondary structure. These \u2018weak\u2019 mRNAs are not characterised by low stability or abundance, but are rather inherently weakly translated. As a general rule, complex hairpin structures upstream of the start codon repress translation, and often these \u2018weak\u2019 mRNAs have oncogenic potential. In contrast, transcripts of housekeeping genes such as GAPDH mRNA are efficiently translated even in the presence of low eIF4F levels. Consistently, an increase in either amount or activity of eIF4E leads to increased translation of a subset of mRNAs, rather than elevated rates of global translation. However, the mRNA target repertoire of eIF4E may differ between different tissue types (Hsieh and Ruggero, 2010; Livingstone et al., 2010; Richter and Sonenberg, 2005).",

Both are TRIM proteins induced by p53 and IFNs, containing a p53\u2010response element in intron 1 in their genetic sequence (Carthagena et al., 2009; de Stanchina et al., 2004; Obad et al., 2004). Furthermore, they are both involved in viral defence. However, in an evolutionary perspective, they are quite distantly related with barely detectable homology (Sardiello et al., 2008). Given the connection of both p53 and IFNs to regulation of cell growth and proliferation, and to the response to cell stress, we wondered whether TRIM22 also might be able to bind to eIF4E and repress translation in a manner similar to PML. Indeed, our data show that TRIM22 directly or indirectly interacts with eIF4E and represses protein translation. However, in contrast to PML, which interrupts the binding of eIF4E to the mRNA m7G\u2010cap structure, we show that TRIM22 inhibits the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G. Consistently, we demonstrate that TRIM22 represses IRF\u20107, a \u2018weak\u2019 mRNA highly dependent on eIF4F for translation. Moreover, also dissimilar from PML, TRIM22 inhibits translation in a RING domain independent manner. Taken together, our data increase our understanding of the function of TRIM22 and suggest a mechanism by which TRIM22 influences protein translation, which may be of significance in response to p53 and/or IFN signalling.",

PML (TRIM19) has been shown to bind to eIF4E through its RING domain, repressing cap\u2010dependent protein translation (Kentsis et al., 2001). To study whether TRIM22 also interacts with eIF4E, TRIM22 was co\u2010transfected together with eIF4E into 293T/17 cells after which sequential immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed. A TRIM22 construct with deleted RING domain (TRIM22\u2013delRING) was utilised to determine if the RING domain is necessary also for the ability of TRIM22 to interact with eIF4E. As demonstrated in Figure 1, specific bands were obtained in reciprocal experiments, revealing that both full\u2010length TRIM22 and, interestingly also TRIM22\u2013delRING, were pulled down together with eIF4E. Hence, TRIM22 interacts directly or indirectly with eIF4E and moreover, unlike PML, the interaction is independent of the RING domain of TRIM22. However, the possibility that RNA might mediate the interaction between TRIM22 and eIF4E cannot be excluded, since RNAse was not included in the experiments.",

To that end, TRIM22 or TRIM22\u2013delRING were transfected into 293T/17 cells, after which the cells were lysed. To isolate cap\u2010binding fractions of eIF4E in the presence and absence of TRIM22, equal protein amounts were precipitated with the mRNA cap\u2010analogue 7\u2010methyl\u2010GTP sepharose 4B. However, neither full\u2010length TRIM22 nor TRIM22\u2013delRING showed any effect on the amount of precipitated eIF4E (Figure 2A), indicating that TRIM22 does not affect the binding of eIF4E to the mRNA m7G\u2010cap. Interestingly, both TRIM22 as well as TRIM22\u2013delRING were precipitated with the m7G\u2010cap analogue, confirming the interaction of TRIM22 with the cap\u2010binding fraction of eIF4E (Figure 2A). However, TRIM22 was not unspecifically precipitated by sepharose, as shown in Figure 1C, talking against an unspecific interaction of TRIM22 with sepharose 4B. In order to study whether TRIM22 affects the interaction of eIF4E with other binding partners, levels of the scaffold protein eIF4G and the inhibitory protein 4E\u2010BP1 were analysed. Since eIF4E precipitates with the cap\u2010analogue 7\u2010methyl\u2010GTP sepharose 4B, also the binding partners of eIF4E, for example eIF4G and 4E\u2010BP1, are precipitated. Interestingly, a significantly lesser amount of eIF4G was 7\u2010methyl\u2010GTP precipitated in cells transfected with TRIM22 or TRIM22\u2013delRING (Figure 2A), suggesting TRIM22 to interfere with the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, a step vital for translation to occur. This step is regulated by several proteins, for example 4E\u2010BP1, binding the same region of eIF4E as does eIF4G (Asnaghi et al., 2004). However, the amount of precipitated 4E\u2010BP1 was not diminished in the TRIM22\u2010transfected cells, suggesting that TRIM22 does not affect the binding of 4E\u2010BP1 to eIF4E (Figure 2A).",

Protein levels were also visualised by Western blot using an anti\u2010luciferase antibody, confirming the downregulation of luciferase protein in the presence of TRIM22 (Figure 3C).

Since the RING domain is required for the ubiquitin E3\u2010ligase activity of TRIM22 (Duan et al., 2008; Eldin et al., 2009), deletion of the RING domain abolishes the ubiquitin E3\u2010ligase activity of TRIM22. As expected, full\u2010length TRIM22 repressed luciferase activity. Also TRIM22 lacking the RING domain repressed the reporter activity, suggesting that the RING domain is dispensable for the repressive effect on protein expression (Figure 4B). This also suggests luciferase not to be degraded by the E3\u2010ligase activity of TRIM22. However, the TRIM22\u2013delSPRY exhibited a significantly weaker repressive effect, demonstrating specificity for the translational repression of full\u2010length TRIM22 and TRIM22\u2013delRING. These data are consistent with our previous results showing the RING domain to be dispensable for both eIF4E binding and disruption of the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G (Figures 1 and 2). The deletion of the RING domain from TRIM22 results in a protein of approximately 7 kDa less molecular weight. Still, TRIM22\u2013delRING was visualised with approximately equal size as full\u2010length TRIM22 on Western blot (Figure 4C). Therefore, cDNA sequencing of both constructs was performed, showing the expected sequence. Moreover, in vitro translated TRIM22\u2013delRING migrated faster than in vitro translated full\u2010length TRIM22 with expected differences in molecular weight, even though in vivo translated full\u2010length TRIM22 and TRIM22\u2013delRING were visualised with equal size on the same protein gel (Supplementary Figure S1). We cannot explain why proteins of expected different molecular weight after expression in vivo migrate at a similar rate on the gel as observed in Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S1.",

            "text": "As we had observed that TRIM22 reduced luciferase protein translation, we asked whether this effect is specific for luciferase protein or whether it extends to other proteins as well. Therefore, a protein synthesis assay was performed. Since PML is implicated in translational repression, enhanced green flourescent protein (eGFP)\u2010tagged PML was used as a positive control (Cohen et al., 2001). To that end, 293T/17 cells were transfected with eGFP\u2010tagged TRIM22, PML or eGFP alone. After 24 and 72 h, the cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 2 h. In order to avoid results being skewed by possible cell death, the fraction of dead cells was estimated by the cell death markers Annexin V and 4\u2032,6\u2010diamidino\u20102\u2010phenylindole (DAPI). No TRIM22\u2010related effects on cell viability could be observed, and the amount of cell death in either cell population was never higher than 10% (data not shown). To analyse the effects of TRIM22 on total protein translation, equal amounts of gated viable eGFP, TRIM22\u2013eGFP or PML\u2013eGFP cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation of proteins was performed. The precipitated radioactive labelling, reflecting the amount of newly synthesised proteins, was then measured in a scintillator. PML repressed radiolabelled methionine incorporation to a modest, but however not statistically significant, degree (Figure 5). This is compatible with the documented role of PML in translation, since PML mainly represses translation of certain mRNAs (Culjkovic et al., 2006). In the presence of TRIM22, a repression of methionine incorporation was observed, revealing that TRIM22 does repress total protein synthesis to a statistically significant extent. In order to study whether TRIM22 represses translation initiation, also polysome fractionation experiments were performed. Compatible with our previous results, expression of TRIM22 induced a slight increase in the accumulation of 80S ribosomes (Supplementary Figure S3). Although not entirely conclusive, these results are consistent with the moderate effects of TRIM22 on total protein translation, and support that TRIM22 may inhibit translation initiation.",

Indeed, disturbance of the binding between eIF4E and eIF4G is known to particularly affect certain mRNAs with a more complex secondary structure. IRF\u20107 is recognised to be one of these \u2018weak\u2019 mRNAs with a complex secondary structure and has been shown to be strongly regulated on the translational level (Colina et al., 2008; Erickson and Gale, 2008; Sonenberg, 2008). Therefore, we transfected 293T/17 cells with eGFP\u2010tagged TRIM22 or eGFP alone, sorted for eGFP\u2010expressing cells and performed Western blot with an IRF\u20107 antibody. Jurkat cells treated with IFN\u03b1 for 24 h were used as positive controls for the IRF\u20107C bands. 293T/17 cells only express the small IRF\u20107 isoform C (Zhao et al., 2010), which indeed was repressed by TRIM22 (Figures 6A and 6B). To determine whether this repression is regulated on the translational or transcriptional level, we also analysed the amount of IRF\u20107 mRNA. No effect on IRF\u20107 mRNA levels could, however, be observed (Figure 6C), demonstrating that TRIM22 inhibits translation rather than transcription of IRF\u20107 mRNA. However, as demonstrated in Figures 2B, 3C, 4B, 6A and 6D, TRIM22 did not have any effect on the protein levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH or histone H3. Because of a non\u2010complex secondary structure of its mRNA, GAPDH is known to be readily translated even in the presence of low eIF4F levels, (Hsieh and Ruggero, 2010; Livingstone et al., 2010; Richter and Sonenberg, 2005). Probably also histone H3 is easily translated due to its basic function in the cells. To exclude the possibility that TRIM22 degrades IRF\u20107C, we also analysed cells transfected with TRIM22\u2013delRING (Figures 6D and 6E). In this experiment, we co\u2010transfected TRIM22 or TRIM22\u2013delRING together with eGFP, where after eGFP expressing, cells were sorted on a fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting (FACS) Aria and subjected to Western blotting. Indeed, also TRIM22\u2013delRING transfected cells exhibited a reduced amount of IRF\u20107C protein. Since the RING domain is necessary for the ubiquitin E3\u2010ligase activity of TRIM22, this suggests IRF\u20107C not to be degraded in the presence of TRIM22. In conclusion, these data further strengthens the idea of TRIM22 as a regulator of translation of certain mRNAs with a higher dependence on eIF4F. It might seem contradictory that both TRIM22 and IRF\u20107C are induced by IFN\u03b1, since according to our conclusion TRIM22 is expected to counteract the translation of IRF\u20107C. Therefore, we investigated the levels of IRF\u20107C and TRIM22 protein in Jurkat cells treated with 10, 100 and 1,000 U/ml IFN\u03b1 (Supplementary Figure S4). As expected, we demonstrate a dose\u2010dependent increase of TRIM22 upon treatment with 10\u20131000 U/ml IFN\u03b1. Interestingly, however, while IRF\u20107C also increases upon treatment with 10\u2013100 U/ml IFN\u03b1, IRF\u20107C levels clearly decrease with 1,000 U/ml IFN\u03b1, a concentration resulting in the highest levels of TRIM22 (Supplementary Figure S4), consistent with our conclusion that high levels of TRIM22 inhibit translation of IRF\u20107C.",

            "text": "Regulation of protein translation is central to proliferating cancer cells as well as for viral replication. In this context, both p53 and IFNs are important orchestrators, and several translation regulatory molecular mechanisms downstream of p53 and IFN signalling have been identified. For example, p53 can inhibit protein translation by cleavage of the scaffold protein eIF4G or dephosphorylation of 4E\u2010BP1, and IFNs can disturb protein synthesis through induction of PKR, inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 (Constantinou and Clemens, 2007; De Benedetti and Baglioni, 1984; Der and Lau, 1995). Similar to eIF4E, eIF2\u03b1 is extensively regulated in response to cell stress, and is a part of the 43S pre\u2010initiation complex. Here, we suggest a mechanism for translational regulation, possibly mediated by p53 and/or by IFNs. We show here that the IFN\u2010inducible p53 target gene TRIM22 represses translation of the reporter protein luciferase as well as it modestly represses total radiolabelled methionine incorporation. In addition, we demonstrate that the direct or indirect interaction of TRIM22 to the translation initiation factor eIF4E inhibits the binding of eIF4E to the scaffold protein eIF4G. This may result in inhibition of the formation of the eIF4F complex, which is essential for cap\u2010dependent translation to occur. Although an IRES\u2010containing mRNA has not been utilised as a control for the luciferase experiments (Figure 3), this points towards a role of TRIM22 as a regulator of cap\u2010dependent translation. Indeed, we demonstrate TRIM22 to repress translation of IRF\u20107C, an mRNA well known to be highly dependent upon eIF4F for its translation by means of a complex secondary structure (Colina et al., 2008; Erickson and Gale, 2008; Sonenberg, 2008). Consequently, our data suggest TRIM22 to repress translation of a subset of mRNAs, which are more dependent on eIF4F levels, and perhaps also have a more complex secondary structure. Hence, radiolabelled methionine incorporation experiments where TRIM22 indeed did repress translation to a statistically significant degree probably reflects repressed translation of mRNAs more dependent on eIF4F for their translation. It is well documented that dephosphorylated 4E\u2010BP1 binds to eIF4E, inhibiting its interaction with eIF4G (Van Der Kelen et al., 2009). Our data show that TRIM22 inhibits the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, without affecting the amount of 4E\u2010BP1 binding to eIF4E. This is in line with previous data by Moerke et al. (2007), who utilised a synthetic small inhibitor of the eIF4E\u2013eIF4G interaction, without affecting the levels of 4E\u2010BP1 binding to eIF4E. However, our data rely on over\u2010expressed proteins and the effect of TRIM22 at physiological levels remains to be determined.",

However, PML binds eIF4E through its RING domain, and induces a conformational change of eIF4E, leading to a reduction of the cap\u2010binding ability of eIF4E. Our data show that, unlike PML, the RING domain of TRIM22 is dispensable for eIF4E interaction, and that TRIM22 does not interfere with eIF4E binding to the mRNA m7G\u2010cap. These differences, however, are not very surprising since TRIM22 and PML, in spite of their many similarities, are evolutionarily quite distantly related (Sardiello et al., 2008).",

It could be argued that the downregulation of global protein levels in the presence of TRIM22 in our assays could be due to TRIM22\u2010mediated proteasomal degradation. However, we have shown a specific inhibitory mechanism of TRIM22 with crucial components of the translational machinery, talking against effects merely related to protein degradation. Moreover, the RING domain of TRIM22 is dispensable for both its eIF4E interaction capability as well as for its repressive effects on luciferase and IRF\u20107C protein levels, inconsistent with an effect dependent on the ubiquitin E3\u2010ligase activity of TRIM22 (Duan et al., 2008; Eldin et al., 2009).
