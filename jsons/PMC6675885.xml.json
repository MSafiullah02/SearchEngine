MERS-CoV emerged from a zoonotic origin, with the original host thought to be bats and the current host reservoir being camels (2\u20135). The virus has yet to show sustained transmission between humans, but, with no currently approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines, MERS-CoV is considered a \u201cthreat to global health\u201d by the WHO.

The genome is now highly annotated, due in part to experiments performed with the yeast knockout library collection (14, 15). The yeast knockout collection systematically knocked out each gene in S. cerevisiae with a known DNA cassette containing a unique \u201cbarcode\u201d region. Therefore, by taking any yeast cell from within this library and PCR amplifying and sequencing the barcode region, it is possible to determine which gene has been deleted from that cell. The project managed to knock out \u223c4,600 of the \u223c6,000 yeast genes; deletion of the others resulted in an inability to produce viable yeast, and they were deemed essential for growth in glucose (Glu) media. Therefore, the yeast knockout collection represents a widely available, semi-genome-wide knockout library of yeast.",

Yeast lack an interferon response, and since ORF4a has largely been studied in experiments designed to disrupt these pathways, we hypothesized that ORF4a must have further functions in a eukaryotic cell that have yet to be analyzed. To investigate the cellular pathways that ORF4a interacts with in yeast, we took advantage of the yeast knockout library. We hypothesized that removal of genes involved in the ORF4a-mediated slow growth would cause a reversion of the slow-growth phenotype, allowing the identification of genetic suppressors. This screening approach identified the YDL042C/SIR2 yeast gene as a suppressor of ORF4a-mediated slow growth, and that gene became the focus of our study.",

Since that initial identification, sirtuins have been defined as NAD-dependent histone deacetylases (32) involved in regulating a multitude of cellular functions, including metabolism, apoptosis, stress responses, DNA repair, and gene expression (33\u201336). The mammalian homologue of SIR2, SIRT1, has been shown to have both proviral and antiviral roles, depending on the virus (37\u201343), making this an attractive candidate hit from our yeast-based screening for study in mammalian cells. Moreover, it has previously been suggested that resveratrol, a compound that activates sirtuins, inhibits MERS-CoV replication, and yet no mechanism was investigated in that work (44). Given the combination of SIRT1 being shown to have roles in replication of mammalian viruses and the fact that SIR2 was the most commonly identified gene in our suppressor screen, this sirtuin became the focus of the study.

The yeast-based screening system demonstrated a functional link between ORF4a and SIR2. We did not observe a direct interaction between ORF4a and SIRT1 in mammalian cells.

Grown in the presence of 2% glucose (Glu), the expression of viral genes was inhibited and the yeast strain containing this plasmid was able to grow similarly to yeast transformed with a vector control (Fig. 1B and data not shown). However, grown in the presence of 2% galactose (Gal), viral genes were expressed. We analyzed whether any of the MERS-CoV-encoded proteins could inhibit yeast growth by performing 48 h growth curves, measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) on an automated plate reader as the readout for growth (Fig. 1A). We found that the following four MERS-CoV proteins inhibited growth of yeast: NSP5 (green dotted/dashed line in Fig. 1A), NSP10 (maroon line), NSP15 (orange line), and ORF4a (gray line). The other MERS-CoV genes examined had only a modest impact or no impact on growth, suggesting that expression of GFP-tagged proteins alone was not responsible for the slow growth observed. We decided to focus our further study on ORF4a as this accessory protein has been best described for roles in inhibiting the mammalian interferon (IFN) response, which is not conserved in yeast, therefore suggesting the possibility of hitherto-undescribed functions of ORF4a in eukaryotic cells. The growth inhibition caused by ORF4a was further assessed on solid media, where the levels of growth on Glu plates (no protein expression) were indistinguishable between vector control and ORF4a-expressing yeast whereas growth on Gal plates displayed growth inhibition of yeast expressing ORF4a (Fig. 1B). The results from an initial liquid-culture screening were also further confirmed (Fig. 1C).",

We hypothesized that knockout of yeast genes involved in the ORF4a-mediated slow growth might reduce the level of inhibition and therefore increase the growth rate. To test this hypothesis, the inducible ORF4a plasmid was transformed into a pooled collection of the yeast knockout library. This library consists of \u223c4,600 nonessential gene knockouts. When this transformed library was plated onto Glu plates, the yeast colonies that formed were of similar sizes (Fig. 1D, Glu). However, plated to Gal plates to induce ORF4a expression, a broad range of colony sizes were observed (Fig. 1D, Gal). Of most interest were the large colonies, as these were thought to have been formed by yeast cells that contain deletions of genes that confer a suppressor phenotype on ORF4a-mediated slow growth. Large colonies were picked from Gal plates and were tested for growth in liquid culture and for continued expression of ORF4a (data not show). Suppressors were determined as knockout yeast that expressed ORF4a and showed enhanced growth compared to ORF4a-expressing wild-type (WT) yeast. The identity of the knockout was determined by PCR amplification and sequencing of the unique barcode regions that are used in the yeast knockout library.",

These 56 colonies determined as hits were sequenced and found to represent 42 different genes (Table 1). The most commonly detected gene knockout was YDL042C/SIR2 (no other sirtuin genes were detected). Tested in liquid culture, \u0394YDL042C/SIR2 colonies picked from Gal plates showed a suppressor phenotype. Panel E of Fig. 1 shows an example of a single colony that was picked from a galactose screening plate that had a suppressor phenotype. When the growth rate of the initial fast-growing colony was assessed, the identity of the gene knockout was unknown. Subsequent sequencing determined it to be \u0394YDL042C. This colony represented one of the five \u0394YDL042C colonies that were identified as suppressors in the screen. The colony displayed in Fig. 1E still maintained expression of ORF4a, such that the enhanced growth was not a consequence of a lack of expression of the viral protein (Fig. 1F). To validate the hypothesis that YDL042C/SIR2 is indeed a suppressor of ORF4a, a confirmed YDL042C/SIR2 deletion strain was transformed with the ORF4a expression plasmid. When the known transformed deletion strain was tested for growth (Fig. 1G) and protein expression (Fig. 1H), the suppressor phenotype was maintained. To further validate identification of YDL042C as a specific suppressor of ORF4a, \u0394YDL042C yeast cells were also transformed with an empty vector or a vector expressing SARS-CoV ORF3b with a GFP tag (which does not cause a slow-growth phenotype). Empty vector and ORF3b-GFP \u0394YDL042C yeast grew at rates similar to those seen with the vector control yeast, suggesting that the \u0394YDL042C phenotype did not stimulate enhanced growth and therefore that the suppressor phenotype seen when ORF4a was present was specific (Fig. 1I). Combined, these data argue that YDL042C/SIR2 is a bona fide genetic suppressor of ORF4a-mediated slow growth.",

Endogenous SIRT1 is localized to the nucleus in Huh7 cells, with areas that appear to have lower-intensity labeling (Fig. 2A). Transfected into Huh7 cells, a plasmid encoding ORF4a-GFP showed GFP signal in the cytosol, with additional puncta in the nucleus (Fig. 2B), in agreement with previously published data (7). The colabeling of these transfected cells with antibodies against SIRT1 showed both proteins to be in the nucleus. However, the nuclear puncta of ORF4a-GFP appeared to be in regions with lower levels of SIRT1 labeling (Fig. 2B). In cells infected with MERS-CoV, labeled with antisera to ORF4a, and colabeled with anti-SIRT1 antibody, ORF4a was founded in the nucleus and in cytosolic puncta, while SIRT1 was still localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2C). The more punctate appearance of cytosolic ORF4a in infected cells was possibly a result of lower expression levels compared to the overexpression construct. Overall, it appears that endogenous SIRT1 was localized to the nucleus, while GFP-tagged ORF4a and ORF4a expressed during infection were both localized in the nucleus and cytosol.",

The overexpression constructs appeared to show a localization pattern similar to that seen with endogenous SIRT1 when expressed individually in cells (data not shown) and when cotransfected with ORF4a-GFP (Fig. 3B), suggesting that these are useful for investigating interaction of ORF4a and SIRT1 proteins. Once again, both SIRT1-Flag and ORF4a-GFP were seen in the nucleus, suggesting that they are in the same compartment of cells and therefore could potentially interact. To investigate this more directly, we used coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. Cells were transfected with ORF4a-GFP alone or in combination with WT or H363Y SIRT1-Flag-expressing plasmids. Anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate ORF4a-GFP, which could be detected in the IP fraction in blotting with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3C). In cells cotransfected with ORF4a-GFP and either of the SIRT1 constructs, while ORF4a-GFP could be precipitated, SIRT1 was detected only in the nonspecific and flowthrough fractions and never in the IP fraction (Fig. 3C).

The genetic suppression observed in yeast does not necessitate a direct interaction between the two proteins. We therefore hypothesized that ORF4a may modulate SIRT1 activity indirectly to regulate MERS-CoV replication. If this were the case, modulation of SIRT1 activity should alter the replication of MERS-CoV. It has previously been suggested that resveratrol, a chemical compound that broadly activates sirtuin proteins, can inhibit MERS-CoV replication (44). We looked to reproduce these results and indeed found that at higher concentrations, resveratrol was capable of inhibiting MERS-CoV replication as judged by assessing viral titer released into the supernatant (Fig. 4A). This inhibition was seen when the drug was added 2 h before, at the same time as, or 2 h after virus was added to the cells, suggesting that resveratrol was not inhibiting entry stages of infection. We additionally tested the impact of EX527, a chemical that inhibits SIRT1. These data showed that SIRT1 inhibition also resulted in inhibition of MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 4B). This result was again seen regardless of time of addition. Neither of these results appeared to be fully explainable by cell death, as only small differences were observed at the higher concentrations of drug in assessments of cell viability by CellTitre-Glo assay (Fig. 4C).",

In order to further assess the effect of SIRT1 on MERS-CoV replication, a CRISPRi approach was used (46). For this, Huh7 cells that stably express a catalytically dead version of Cas9 (dCas9) were produced through lentiviral transduction. The dCas9 can be inducibly expressed and binds to DNA as directed by the guide RNA but does not cleave, instead acting as a steric block to transcription. Moreover, a KRAB element on the dCas9 further enhances transcriptional repression. These stable Huh7-dCas9 cells were further transfected to stably express a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to target the SIRT1 gene. Two lentiviral preparations were used to independently transfect two separate populations of Huh7 cells stably expressing the dCas9 construct (Huh7-dCas9 cells). The sgRNA is constitutively expressed, while the dCas9 is doxycycline (DOX) inducible; therefore, the stable cell populations can be divided into DOX-treated and untreated populations for internal controls of target gene knockdown. Both Huh7-dCas9-sgRNA cell populations demonstrated knockdown of SIRT1 under conditions of treatment with DOX for 7 days (Fig. 6A). When these doxycycline-treated cells were infected with MERS-CoV, there was a significant inhibition of replication in both populations (Fig. 6B). Knockdown of SIRT1 by both siRNA and CRISPRi inhibited MERS-CoV replication, showing this protein to be a proviral factor for replication.",

ORF4a functions as a double-stranded RNA binding protein that disrupts RIG-I, MDA5, PKR, and stress granule responses in infected cells to promote viral replication (7\u201312). ORF4a is well characterized as an inhibitor of the interferon response. Yeast species do not have an interferon response and yet show growth inhibition by ORF4a expression, suggesting further functional cellular interactions for the protein. To investigate the ways in which ORF4a might inhibit yeast growth, a suppressor screen was utilized. By screening the yeast knockout library for suppressors of ORF4a-induced growth attenuation, the YDL042C yeast gene was identified. The YDL042C gene encodes the SIR2 protein, and our work validated this as a bona fide suppressor of the the ORF4a-mediated slow-growth phenotype. The suppressor screen results suggest that there is a functional link between the two proteins but that the link does not rely on a direct physical interaction.",

Alternatively, resveratrol may have other effects on cell biology that inhibit MERS-CoV replication. Since SIRT1 was shown to be a proviral factor by our data and since resveratrol can activate SIRT1 function, it appears that the antiviral properties of resveratrol may outweigh the potential proviral function of SIRT1 or that the proviral role of SIRT1 is not based on its catalytic activity. Indeed, our experiments looking at the NF-\u03baB pathway (discussed further below) suggest that SIRT1 may have activity in a catalytically dead form, arguing for a role in MERS-CoV replication that does not require enzymatic function. The role of other sirtuins in MERS-CoV replication and in how MERS-CoV modulates these to promote infection is the focus of future studies.",

SIRT1 has previously been shown to modulate NF-\u03baB signaling in response to TNF-\u03b1 (47). This work demonstrated a direct interaction between SIRT1 and p65/RelA and that SIRT1 inhibited the pathway by deacetylation of this NF-\u03baB protein. We therefore reasoned that this modulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway could be used as a readout to determine whether ORF4a expression alters SIRT1 function. Interestingly, we found that SIRT1 overexpression in HEK293T cells actually resulted in an enhanced NF-\u03baB response following TNF-\u03b1 treatment and that this enhancement occurred regardless of the level of catalytic activity of SIRT1. This discrepancy with previously published work could represent a result of the use of different cell lines. Our data suggest that SIRT1 promotes NF-\u03baB signaling in HEK293T cells, perhaps by directly binding NF-\u03baB and acting as a scaffold protein or by altering steps downstream in the signaling pathway, but that it does so independently of catalytic activity.",

Our experiments demonstrated that ORF4a was a potent suppressor of NF-\u03baB signaling in HEK293T cells. When ORF4a and SIRT1 were coexpressed in cells, there was no longer an enhancement in luciferase production from the \u03baB promoter. We cannot rule out the possibility that ORF4a may influence NF-\u03baB signaling independently of SIRT1, but SIRT1 overexpression was not able to overcome ORF4a-mediated inhibition. These data, along with the genetic link observed in yeast, suggest that ORF4a and SIRT1 may have a functional connection without direct binding and that there is an additional node of regulation between the two proteins, which is under investigation. This work adds SIRT1 to the list of host factors that mediate MERS-CoV replication such as stress granule formation and host innate immune machinery (9\u201312). The magnitude of inhibition when those factors are affected is \u223c1 log, demonstrating that, as seen in SIRT1, host machinery interacts with various virus replication steps to potentially hinder replication. All of these factors demonstrate novel therapeutic targets for future development.",

We currently do not understand how SIRT1 enhances MERS-CoV replication or the role that ORF4a plays in this. We hypothesize that acetylation of additional cellular or viral proteins during MERS-CoV replication is required for efficient replication and that ORF4a has evolved to modulate this activity.
