Mutation from low pathogenic (LPAI) viruses, whose natural reservoir is wild waterbirds, to HPAI forms occurs in poultry, but only viruses of the H5 and H7 haemagglutinin types cause highly pathogenic disease. The increase in size of HPAI outbreaks in the past decade is due to the growth of the poultry industry, with over 16 billion chickens and 1 billion duck being reared worldwide in 2004. Kuiken identified the unusual aspects of the current H5N1 outbreak as: direct transmission from birds to human beings and other mammals resulting in severe disease, systemic disease in human beings and other mammals, and free-living birds as a mode of virus spread, but without an evident link to to poultry.",

Thus migratory ducks maintain apathogenic influenza viruses that cannot infect chickens, but passage through geese, turkey, or quail leads to LPAI that can infect chickens and hence mutate to HPAI. Kida noted that the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic viruses were reassortants between avian viruses and the preceding human strains. Thus, because avian viruses of any subtype can contribute genes for reassortants, none of the 15 haemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase subtypes\u2014all of which occur in ducks\u2014can be ruled out as potential candidates for future pandemics.",

A better understanding of the genetics, molecular markers, and antigenic features of the influenza virus might answer this question, and, Shortridge believed, make prevention of pandemics an achievable objective. Shortridge also noted how the spread of H5N1 from Asia followed the trans-Siberia railway, rather than any know patterns of wild-bird migration, and is thus probably the result of human movement of poultry and poultry products.",

The incubation period for human infection was in the range 1\u201315 days, with a median of 3\u20135 days. However, there have been no new human or poultry cases since Nov 2005. Hien recommended that avian influenza should be considered a combined agricultural, public health, economic, and social threat. The H5N1 outbreak in Thailand also occured in three waves between Nov 2003 and Dec 2005, resulting in 22 human cases and 14 deaths. According to Kumnuan Ungchusak (Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand), complacency caused the repeated outbreaks and political committment during the second wave was the eventual key to tackling the outbreak.",

The process for producing seasonal influenza vaccines was used because of extensive experience with these vaccines and the likelihood of more rapid licensure.

However, reducing the amount of antigen in each dose would allow for more doses. GSK has been working on an adjuvant that boosts the immune response in combination with lower amounts of antigen. Clinical trials are ongoing with an inactivated subunit H5N1 vaccine that uses the GSK adjuvant. In animal studies, the adjuvant gives cross protection between vaccination with one viral strain and challenge with another, which implies that stockpiling of vaccine may be feasible even if we do not know in advance the pandemic strain of virus.",

However, targeted geographic prophylaxis with a neuraminidase inhibitor (eg, oseltamivir) might succeed in containing or delaying emergence of a pandemic. Hayden also concluded that concerns over development of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors should not be a deterrent to stockpiling of these drugs. A multicentre randomised trial in southeast Asia will compare standard and higher dose oseltamivir in hospitalised patients with H5N1 disease or severe influenza. An injectable antiviral is needed to help control a future influenza outbreak, and Hayden noted that trials are in progress with injectable forms of zanamivir and the investigational neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir.",

For example, closing schools would slow the spread of disease, but must be done in the first week or two of a national epidemic. Vaccinating 30\u201350% of the population\u2014assuming an effective vaccine were available\u2014could stop the spread of a national epidemic. However, closing borders would have to be 99% effective to have an impact on controlling a country epidemic. David Bell (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) noted that during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, among 35 million international travellers who were thermally scanned no SARS cases were detected; however, during an influenza pandemic, non-essential domestic travel to affected areas should be discouraged. Bell stated that forced isolation and quarantine are likely to be ineffective, but ill patients should be encouraged to stay at home. Whereas there is not sufficient evidence for recommendations on the use of masks by the public, hand hygiene lowers the rate of upper-respiratory-tract infections.",
