            "text": "Since the discovery of the first members of the Mesoniviridae family, order Nidovirales (Junglen et al., 2009; Zirkel et al., 2011; Nga et al., 2011), a growing number of new species has been found in different parts of the world (Africa, Asia, North America and Australia) (Lauber et al., 2012; Kuwata et al., 2013; Zirkel et al., 2013; Vasilakis et al., 2014; Warrilow et al., 2014; Hang et al., 2016). Mesoniviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA ([+]ssRNA) viruses and constitute the only insect-associated genus of nidoviruses. The 20 kb nidovirus genome organization is generally ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2a-ORF2b-ORF3a-ORF3b, except the Alphamesonivirus1 species, which encodes a seventh open reading frame (ORF4) (Vasilakis et al., 2014). ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode two polymerase polyproteins (pp) while the other ORFs encode structural proteins (Zirkel et al., 2011; Hang et al., 2016). Viral particles are enveloped, spherical in shape and 60\u201380 nm in diameter with club-shaped surface spikes (Zirkel et al., 2013). Like insect-specific flaviviruses (Hoshino et al., 2007; Huhtamo et al., 2009) and other mosquito-associated bunyaviruses (Marklewitz et al., 2013) and orbiviruses (Harrison et al., 2016), mesoniviruses are considered insect specific viruses (ISVs) as the totality of detection has come from mosquito pools and isolations only from insect cells lines, while no detection or replication has been reported in mammalian models (Nga et al., 2011; Zirkel et al., 2011; Vasilakis et al., 2014).",

Briefly, trapping was done in different human dwellings of villages of eastern Senegal. In each village, at least 10 houses were selected following a transect going from the peripheral borders to the center in order to cover all the ecological profiles. The different trapping sessions were performed during twilight, where most of arboviruses vectors such as Aedes species are active. Three methods were used: (1) human landing catches, the most appropriate method for determining the risk of human infection (Diallo et al., 2014), (2) CDC light traps with or without CO2 bait, shown to have relatively high sampling efficiency (Okumu et al., 2008) but to be less specific to particular anthropophilic species, (3) indoor residual spraying for endophilic species collection. Adhesive trap catches were also performed for sandflies. After morphological identification, collected insects were pooled by species in tubes and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until viral detection processing. Each pool was triturated in L-15 medium and RNA was extracted as described below.",

This observation was confirmed by a parallel analysis using a neighbor-Joining approach for which one no discrepancy was noted, as shown in figure S1 in supplemental material. The classical mesonivirus genome organization was found, with the typical ORFs and the putative ribosomal frame-shift (RFS) element in ORF1a and ORF1b, the 3C-like serine protease (3CLP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), zinc-binding (Z), helicase (Hel), exoribonuclease (ExoN), N7-methyltransferase (NMT) and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (OMT) domains. Block insertions observed after the first 1300 nt of the ORF1a of some Asian strains (Vasilakis et al., 2014) were absent in the Senegal sequence. Protein sequence identity of ORF 1, ORF 2 and ORF 3 were 91 %, 94 % and 91 %, respectively (Table 4). Pairwise evolutionary distance (PED) is the reference species demarcation criterion in the Mesonivirus genus (Lauber et al., 2012). Using the conserved protein domains of ORF1ab (3CLpro, RdRp and Hel) (Vasilakis et al., 2014), we calculated PED between the virus and some previously described mesoniviruses selected from the blast output using a protein alignment. We considered the same consensus threshold of 0.037 as minimum distance for the demarcation of nidovirus species based on the concatenated protein domains (Lauber et al., 2012). In accordance with a previous study (Warrilow et al., 2014), a PED value of 0.031 was obtained between CavV and NDiV isolates (Table 5), which constitutes the species Alphamesonivirus 1 as previously described (Lauber et al., 2012). The Senegal isolate was closest to Alphamesonivirus 1 with distances of 0.042, 0.044 and 0.053 separating it from Houston virus (HOUV), Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) and Cavally virus (CavV), respectively. The highest distance was observed with Nse (NseV), Casuarina (CASV) and Hana viruses (HAV) with PED values of 0.243, 0.123 and 0.117, respectively (Table 5). These results are reflected by the tree obtained with the different sequences involved in the maximum likelihood analysis (Fig. 2\n), as well as a neighbor-joining approach (figure S2 in supplemental material). Our isolates represent a new species in the Mesonivirus genus. We proposed Dianke virus (DKV) (Accession number: MN622133) as a name for this virus, referring to one of the sampling localities.",

Genome organization showed typical mesonivirus features. The species demarcation based on previously employed criteria (Lauber et al., 2012) allowed us to conclude that this mesonivirus constitute a new species that we named Dianke virus (DKV), referring to one of the places where the strain have been found. Molecular screening undertaken in the same areas resulted in detection of the same virus in 43 mosquito pools from 21 species. These results are similar to previous observations where a broad host species range in mosquitoes suggested a worldwide mesoniviruses distribution (Vasilakis et al., 2014), while Colmant et al.

Indeed, it has been shown that dual viral infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity (Fujita et al., 2018) and ISVs are more and more considered as potential disease control agents in vector populations (Guzman et al., 2018; \u00d6hlund et al., 2019). Virus phenotypic restriction could be more complex as Parry and Asgari (2018) highlighted that restriction of Dengue virus replication in Ae.aegypti mosquitoes could be hindered by interactions between a novel ISV and the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. In contrast, Zhang et al. (2017) pointed out that Cell fusing agent virus, another ISV, favor Dengue virus replication in Ae.aegypti cell lines. All together, the current studies highlight gaps in the understanding of interactions between ISVs and other pathogenic viruses. It has been shown that the host range restriction of insect-specific flaviviruses and alphaviruses occurs at different levels of viral replication cycle (Nasar et al., 2015; Junglen et al., 2017). Among intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting viral replication and transmissibility, temperature was shown to be of an extreme importance (Samuel et al., 2016). The experiments undertaken in this study tends to confirm this assessment as DKV was unable to replicate in permissive mosquito C6/36 cells at 37 \u00b0C. However, the virus did not grow in different mammal cells at the mosquito temperature of 28 \u00b0C. The host restriction phenomenon for mesoniviruses and the other ISVs remain to be further studied.",
