While this has tremendous benefits in cultural and societal advancements, it also creates great liability in epidemiology as modern outbreaks have no borders and cross all levels of society, regardless of race, ethnicity or socio-economic status. The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has ushered in unprecedented times. As the average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others, its spread is exponential. A large number of healthcare workers who died in China in the early days of this disease were ENTs and ophthalmologists. This is possibly due to the high viral shed from the nasal cavity. In Wuhan, 14 people became infected after an endoscopic pituitary surgery on a single COVID-19 patient. SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to remain aerosolized for 3 hours after contamination and on plastics and stainless steel for up to 72 hours. This makes the dental community a relatively high-risk population.",

            "text": "Pandemics inflict devastating consequences on communities and cause long-term rippling effects in the economy and the health care system. AIDS was first described as Gay Related Immunodeficiency Syndrome (GRIDS) in 1981. Young gay men began falling ill and dying of opportunistic infection and fear of the \"gay plague\" spread rapidly along with the social stigma. Two years later, the CDC documented heterosexual transmission of AIDS 1 . What was originally referred as a \"Gay virus\" transformed into one of the greatest ongoing pandemics and scientific challenges of modern medicine. The AIDS pandemic resulted in acceptance of \"universal precautions\" that revolutionized the standard of care throughout medicine. Prior to HIV/AIDS, dentists did not commonly wear masks or eye protection. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, in an attempt to protect health care workers, OSHA and the CDC proposed guidelines to reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B. Dentistry resisted this change at every step. Dentists argued that 'children would be frightened of the masks.' The ADA led a fight against OSHA's universal precautions rule, arguing that no dentists had contracted these pathogens. In an op-ed published in the New York Times on November 12, 1989, Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a periodontist from New Haven, CT, expressed his opposition this way: \"...these regulations will bring about changes in the dentist-patient relationship and make it more difficult to practice dentistry. By its nature, dentistry is an intimate occupation. The dentist works within an inch of a patient's head, probing sensitive, often tender areas of the patient's body. The mouth embodies our ability to smile, kiss, talk and eat-all very emotional qualities. Patients' needs a warm and trusting relationship with their dentist to help overcome fears and make necessary dentistry possible. It will be more difficult to establish this relationship when the dentist is gowned, shielded, and masked. [These barriers] will have a profound effect on the relationship between the dentist and patient.\" In 1991, the ADA challenged the rule in the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and lost. In 2020, the ADA's resistance to masks and eye protection seems preposterous, particularly given the information we have about bloodborne pathogens today.",

The technology needed to eradicate smallpox was first described in 1798, but took nearly 180 years to execute. This strand of Coronavirus may be new, but we have seen the same societal reaction to outbreaks countless times. With fear and panic brings blame and bigotry. On March 19, 2020, the President of the United States referred to the Coronavirus as the \"Chinese Virus.\" Global threats require unified efforts, which is why terms such as the \"Chinese Virus\" are so detrimental. \"Anti-Chinese hostility has been a recurrent problem, whether with plague in San Francisco in 1900, SARS in 2003, or Covid-19 today.\" 2 AIDS was not contained in the 1980s because it was considered a gay disease. Syphilis was not eradicated with the invention of penicillin because it was said to limit promiscuity. If we learn anything from history, it is that we must come together as a species to fight as one, or perish as individuals.",

Few countries have met their commitments. This is likely due to the cost associated with adopting these advances, as well as society's opposition to change. The cost of an economic bailout will far succeed the cost to prevent a global outbreak. The world needs a coordinated effort by a global institution with enough authority and funding to be efficient 3 . This is of particular interest to doctors as epidemics too often claim the lives of healthcare providers.",

In order for dentistry to do its part to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the ADA recommends dentists nationwide postpone elective procedures for the next three weeks. Concentrating on emergency dental care will allow us to care for our emergency patients and alleviate the burden that dental emergencies would place on hospital emergency departments.\" Are dental offices prepared to treat these potentially infected patients? If a patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and emergency dental care is indicated, it is recommended to perform the dental treatment in a negative pressure room or airborne infection isolation room. 4 What will come of this pandemic? The AIDS pandemic resulted in masks, gowns, and eye protection. Samaranayake et al. published a retrospective review in 2004 after the peak of the SARS outbreak. It found that the SARS outbreak had a large impact on providers with some countries reporting that 25-33% of those infected were health care workers. 5 The study recommended preprocedural rinsing whenever possible to reduce the number of antimicrobial releases into the environment. The utilization of rubber dams can also reduce microbial aerosolization by up to 70%. Hand hygiene is still the singlemost effective method of reducing transmission. Following the SARS outbreak, N95 masks are used throughout Hong Kong for routine dentistry.",

As a profession, we should explore methods of reducing transmission of all infectious agents. External mouth suctions, which work like the scavenger systems in our nitrous oxide devices, are being tested for effectiveness in Korea. Commercial air purifiers and air exchange devices are also being explored for the dental setting. Creating negative pressure operatories may seem a drastic and expensive approach now, but in 40 years dentists may think we were ludicrous for working without them, just as we judge those before us who did not use gloves. This pandemic will impact the delivery of care, the question is when and how. Will dentistry accept the advances or continue our history of fighting change?",
