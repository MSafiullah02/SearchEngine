In support of this concept, we used a modified form of the transcription factor STAT1 to achieve hyper-responsiveness to interferon without toxicity and markedly improve antiviral function in transgenic mice and transduced human cells. We found that the improvement depended on expression of a PARP9-DTX3L complex with distinct domains for interaction with STAT1 and for activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acted on host histone H2BJ to promote interferon-stimulated gene expression and on viral 3C proteases to degrade these proteases via the immunoproteasome. Thus, PARP9-DTX3L acted on host and pathogen to achieve a double layer of immunity within a safe reserve in the interferon signaling pathway. npg",

Thus, deficiency in interferon production or signal transduction leads to defects in immune system-mediated control of microbial pathogens in experimental animal models and in humans 3, 4 . The biological consequences of increased activity of the interferon signaling pathway are less certain, but chronic activation of the production of type I interferons has been linked to autoimmune disease in humans 5 . Moreover, the administration of exogenous interferons is accompanied by toxicity that limits their pharmacological use 6 . Such outcomes suggest that regulation of the interferon signaling pathway is already optimized under native conditions and that enhancing this pathway might not provide a therapeutic benefit without substantial toxicity.",

An alternative strategy might be to enhance the efficiency of endogenous interferon to activate downstream signal transduction. While targeting the responsiveness of the interferon signal-transduction pathway might be desirable, it is made difficult by the complexity of the interferon signaling pathway and its functional activities. The protective actions of interferons rely on signaling through three types of interferon receptors (for type I, II and III interferons) and the JAK-STAT pathway that includes receptor-associated members of the JAK family of kinases and STAT family of transcription factors, as well as downstream modulators, transcription factors, enhancers and coactivators 7 . In the case of viral infection, the overall process leads to the expression of hundreds of distinct products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that provide functional effector activities but also feed back into interferon signaling 2, 8 . Moreover, interferon signaling may also interact with other cytokine signaling pathways (for example, a pathway that includes the cytokine TNF) with additional immunological consequences 9 .",

Moreover, a mutant STAT1 with substitution of cysteine for alanine at positions 656 and 658 (STAT1-CC) enhances signal transduction via type I and II interferons in human cells, at least in vitro 11 . This enhancement is due to the enhanced capacity of STAT1-CC for transcriptosome assembly at the promoters of ISGs, which is manifested by prolonged activation (indicated by phosphorylation of Tyr701 of STAT1-CC), localization to the nucleus (indicated by binding of DNA by STAT1-CC) and recruitment of co-activators (indicated by binding of the histone acetyltransferase p300 (CBP) to STAT1-CC).

We therefore developed gain-of-function models in transgenic mice and transduced human cells for controlled expression of STAT1-CC. These models showed an increase in the efficiency of interferon signaling and a consequent benefit for host defense against a broad range of viruses. Whole-genome analysis of these models showed that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP9 (also known as BAL1 or ARTD9) 12 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX3L were induced in concert with the interferon hyper-responsiveness. PARP9 was originally identified as being overexpressed in chemotherapy-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphomas 13 and was later reported to bind to DTX3L, which in turn was found to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that selectively ubiquitinates histone H4 and protects cells against DNA-damaging agents [14] [15] [16] . That function was consistent with the conventional role of members of the PARP family in the DNA-repair response 17 . However, PARP9 and DTX3L have also been found in a head-to-head orientation regulated by the same bidirectional interferon-responsive promoter, and overexpression of PARP9 in a malignant B cell lymphoma cell line has been shown to cause widespread induction of ISG expression, which would suggest an alternative role for PARP9 in the interferon signaling pathway 18 . Here we found that PARP9 and DTX3L were STAT1-associated components for interferon signal transduction that were rate limiting and were thus able to enhance interferon efficacy and consequent host defense when expressed in larger amounts. We also identified PARP9-DTX3L as an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targeted both host histone H2BJ to promote ISG expression and viral 3C protease to disrupt viral assembly. These observations offer proof of principle of how a single molecular complex can act on host and pathogen to provide a double benefit for interferon-dependent host defense and thereby afford some guidance for the development of therapeutic agents for interferon-sensitive conditions.",

Together these results indicated that PARP9 and DTX3L were products of ISGs that were upregulated during the expression of STAT1 or STAT1-CC in vitro (in U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells) and in vivo (in CAG-STAT1 and CAG-STAT1-CC mice) and were therefore candidates for mediating STAT1-and STAT1-CC-dependent signal transduction.",

            "text": "To analyze the function of PARP9 and DTX3L, we used lentiviral transduction for stable expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PARP9 mRNA or DTX3L mRNA in U3A, U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells. Specific knockdown of either PARP9 mRNA or DTX3L mRNA resulted in knockdown of both PARP9 and DTX3L protein without influencing the phosphorylation or activation of STAT1 or STAT1-CC ( Supplementary Fig. 5a -e). Knockdown PARP9 mRNA decreased the expression of DTX3L protein without a decrease in DTX3L mRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 5a -e), which suggested that PARP9 might regulate the expression of DTXL protein at a post-translational level. In contrast, knockdown of DTX3L mRNA caused a decrease in the expression of PARP9 protein that reflected the downregulation of PARP9 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5a-e) , which suggested that DTX3L might regulate expression of the PARP9 gene at a transcriptional level. Knockdown of either PARP9 protein or DTX3L protein had no effect on the level of STAT1 or STAT1-CC ( Supplementary Fig. 5c -e) but still resulted in loss of STAT1-CCmediated control of infection with EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) or SINV in U3A cells (Fig. 2d) . Thus, PARP9 and DTX3L were necessary for the beneficial effect of STAT1-CC in controlling viral replication. In addition, restoring PARP9 expression to U3A cells in which PARP9 had been knocked down reversed the downregulation of DTX3L expression and reconstituted the antiviral effect of STAT1-CC on EMCV ( Supplementary Fig. 5f ,g), which again supported the proposal of a role for PARP9 in regulating the expression of DTX3L protein. We also found knockdown of PARP9 mRNA was overcome by treatment with interferon in U3A-STAT1 and U3A-STAT1-CC cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 5h) , which indicated the difficulty in analyzing PARP9-DTX3L loss of function under interferon-stimulation conditions. npg A r t i c l e s We next investigated whether PARP9-DTX3L was able to enhance the antiviral function of wild-type STAT1 in U3A cells overexpressing PARP9 (U3A-STAT1-PARP9 cells) or DTX3L (U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells) or both PARP9 and DTX3L (U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells). We found that control of the EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) or SINV viral load was improved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells but not U3A-STAT1-PARP9 or U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells, and the beneficial effect was increased by combination with interferon treatment in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells (Fig. 3) . These results raised the possibility that PARP9 and DTX3L might work together with STAT1 to enhance interferon signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that PARP9 and DTX3L interacted separately or together with STAT1 with or without interferon stimulation in U3A-STAT1 cells (which expressed FLAG-tagged STAT1, to facilitate these Cell Line: npg A r t i c l e s assays), and immunoblot analysis and immunostaining showed that PARP9 and DTX3L accumulated with STAT1 in the nucleus following stimulation of these cells with interferon ( Fig. 4a-c) . In addition, we found more binding of STAT1 to the promoter of the gene encoding the interferon-response factor (and transcription factor) IRF1 (as assessed by crosslinking chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay), more STAT1-driven activity of promoters of an interferonstimulated response element (ISRE) and an IFN-\u03b3-activated site (GAS) (based on luciferase reporter-transactivation assays) and more localization of STAT1 to the nucleus (based on cell-imaging assays) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells (Fig. 4d-f) . However, the interactions of PARP9 and DTX3L with STAT1 in U3A-STAT1 cells were unchanged by stimulation with interferon ( Fig. 4a) or substitution of STAT1 (Y701F) that eliminated the interferon-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation activation site (U3A-STAT1-Y701F cells) (Supplementary Fig. 6a) . Moreover, we found no difference between U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells and U3A-STAT1 cells in the interferon-driven phosphorylation of STAT1 or in the recruitment of p300 to STAT1-containing transcriptional complexes (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c) . Those results were in contrast to the STAT1-driven increases and STAT1-CC-driven further increases in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and recruitment of p300 to the STAT1 transcriptional complex (Supplementary Fig. 6c ) to increase ISG expression and antiviral function in U3A-STAT1-CC cells 11 . Together these findings indicated that PARP9 and DTX3L associated with STAT1 at baseline and under interferon-stimulated conditions to modulate the localization of STAT1 to the nucleus and its transcriptional activity; however, the precise mechanism by which PARP9-DTX3L enhanced the STAT1-dependent expression of ISGs and antiviral function still needed to be defined.",

            "text": "We recognized from published work on the DNA-repair response that PARP9 has amino-terminal Macro1 and Macro2 domains that recognize poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) for recruitment to sites of DNA damage and that DTX3L has a carboxy-terminal E3 ubiquitin ligase RING domain to ubiquitinate histone H4 at those sites [14] [15] [16] 19, 20 . We therefore investigated whether the ability of the PARP9-DTX3L complex to detect and modify histone H4 chromatin sites during the DNA-repair response might also apply to the response to interferon stimulation. However, we did not detect ubiquitination of histone H4 at baseline or under interferon-stimulated conditions in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d) . To define an alternative mechanism by which PARP9-DTX3L enhanced ISG expression and antiviral control in these cells, we made structural predictions for targeted substitutions of conserved glycine residues in the PARP9 macro domains that are needed for the binding of PAR 21, 22 and in the cysteine residues in the DTX3L RING domain that are needed for catalytic binding of zinc 23 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary  Fig. 7a) . The mutant PARP9 protein (PARP9M) was unable to bind to PAR, while the mutant DTX3L protein (DTX3LM) lacked E3 ligase activity (Supplementary Fig. 7b-d) . We found that the interaction of PARP9M-DTX3LM with STAT1 (Supplementary Fig. 7e) , the interaction between PARP9M and DTX3LM (Supplementary Fig. 7f ) and the phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to interferon (Supplementary Fig. 7g ) were all preserved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells relative to those interactions and phosphorylation in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. These results indicated that the PAR-binding activity of PARP9 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of DTX3L were not required for binding to or activation of STAT1 or formation of the PARP9-DTX3L complex.",

Further analysis with gene-specific PCR assays showed that baseline and IFN-\u03b2-stimulated expression of these ISGs was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells compared with that in U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5c) . We next used a CHART PCR assay ('chromatin accessibility by realtime PCR') to determine whether the pattern for the expression of these ISGs corresponded to an increase in chromatin accessibility (Supplementary Fig. 7h) . Indeed, we found an IFN-\u03b2-stimulated increase in chromatin accessibility in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L A r t i c l e s cells compared with that in U3A-STAT1 cells, and this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 7i) . Similarly, we found that antiviral function against EMCV, IAV (strain A/WS/33) and SINV was enhanced in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L compared with that in U3A-STAT1 cells and that this enhancement was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5e) . Together these results indicated that PARP9-DTX3L enhanced ISG expression and viral control by a mechanism that did not depend on the PAR-binding function of the PARP9 macro domains but might have required the ubiquitination function of the DTX3L-RING domain.",

            "text": "We next aimed to better define the ubiquitination function of DTX3L, particularly in relation to histone ubiquitination that might be linked to chromatin accessibility for ISG expression. Given the uncertainty over which histone(s) might be (a) DTX3L substrate(s), we used ubiquitin-proteome microarrays that included 29 different histones. We found that application of recombinant DTX3L to the microarray resulted in significant ubiquitination of histones H2BJ and H2AFV (isoform 3) (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 6 ), which indicated a high degree of selectivity for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of DTX3L. Native ChIP assays showed greater ubiquitination of H2B and concomitant methylation of histone H3 at Lys4 at the IFIT1 promoter in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L than in U3A-STAT1 cells and that this increase was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM and U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells but was A r t i c l e s preserved U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells (Fig. 5g) . Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of histone H2BJ to the PARP9-DTX3L-STAT1 complex in HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells transfected to express H2BJ, PARP9 and DTX3L (Supplementary Fig. 7j) . We also observed more monoubiquitination of endogenous H2B (but not of H2A) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells at 6 h after infection with EMCV, and this effect was blocked in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (Supplementary Fig. 7k ). Together these findings demonstrated that PARP9-DTX3L selectively ubiquitinated a subset of histones (notably H2BJ) and thereby increased histone methylation as a mechanism for chromatin remodeling and gene expression in at least a subset of ISGs (notably IFIT1), to confer enhanced antiviral function.",

            "text": "To further address the role of PARP9 and STAT1 in the actions of PARP9-DTX3L, we identified domain-based regions of PARP9 and DTX3L proteins (Fig. 6a) for expression in HEK293T cells and used co-immunoprecipitation assays to map the regions of PARP9 and DTX3L required for interactions with each other and with STAT1. At baseline (without interferon stimulation), the interaction of DTX3L with STAT1 was confined to the amino-terminal portion of DTX3L, particularly the D3 domain (Fig. 6b) ; the interaction of PARP9 with STAT1 was mediated through both amino-and carboxyterminal portions of PARP9, particularly the Macro1-Macro2 and PARP domains (Fig. 6c) . Similarly, binding of PARP9 to DTX3L was localized to the D3 domain of DTX3L and the PARP domain of PARP9 (Fig. 6d,e) . In addition, the interaction of PARP9-DTX3L domains with STAT1 were mostly unaffected by deletion of the STAT1 transactivation domain (Fig. 6b,c) , the site of interferoninducible binding of p300 (ref. 24) . Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of PARP9 interacted with STAT1 even in the absence of binding of DTX3L (Fig. 6b,c) . Given such interactions (Supplementary Fig. 8 ), we generated a mutant PARP9 lacking the PARP domain (PARP9-M12), mutant DTX3L lacking the D3 domain (DTX3L-delD3), and mutant DTX3L with only the RING and DTXH domains (DTX3L-RDTXH) (Fig. 6f,g) , for lentiviral transduction and stable expression in U3A-STAT1 cells. We found that DTX3L-delD3, which did not interact with PARP9 ( Fig. 6f) but maintained ubiquitination activity (discussed below), did not control EMCV levels (Fig. 6g) or induce ISG expression (Fig. 6h) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L-delD3 cells, whereas wild-type DTX3L did control EMCV levels and induce ISG expression in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. Similarly, PARP9-M12, which did not interact with DTX3L (Fig. 6f) , did not induce ISG expression (Fig. 6h) in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-M12-DTX3L cells, whereas wild-type PARP9 did induce ISG expression in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells. Of note, both PARP9-M12, which did not interact with DTX3L, and DTX3L-delD3, which did not interact with PARP9, still interacted with STAT1 (Fig. 6g) , which indicated a redundant role in recruiting STAT1 to the complex. Together these results defined a carefully ordered set of domain requirements for the interactions of PARP9 and DTX3L with each other as well as of PARP9-DTX3L with STAT1 in the ISG-dependent response for the control of viral infection.",

            "text": "Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system can degrade the EMCV 3C protease 25 , we investigated whether PARP9-DTX3L might be an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets this protease. We found lower expression of EMCV 3C in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells at 6 h after infection with EMCV (Fig. 7a) . We did not detect a decrease in EMCV 3C in infected U3A cells that had not undergone complementation for STAT1 expression (Fig. 7a) , consistent with a role for the products of STAT1-dependent ISGs (for example, PSMB, PSME and PMSF) in proteasome activity 26 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 1-4) . Moreover, the decrease in EMCV 3C persisted in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3L cells, was lost in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3LM cells and was preserved in U3A-STAT1-DTX3L cells but not in U3A-STAT1-PARP9 cells (Fig. 7a) . The observations that DTX3L alone was able to decrease the amount of EMCV 3C but was unable to fully control viral loads (Fig. 3a) suggested that PARP9 must have also contributed to the antiviral effect under conditions of interferon stimulation or viral infection, as well as at baseline. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the immunoproteasome component, PSMB8, effectively attenuated the degradation of EMCV 3C at 6 h after infection in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells but not in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (Fig. 7b) . The effect of DTX3L was specific to the degradation of EMCV 3C rather than an overall decrease in viral load, because the effect was independent of the amount of viral RNA at 6 h after infection (Fig. 7c) . We also found a smaller amount of EMCV 3C in U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells than in U3A-STAT1 cells at 18 h after infection with or without treatment with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 7d) . Expression of PARP9-DTX3L or DTX3L via transient transfection in HEK293T cells also caused a decrease in EMCV 3C expression, and this effect was sensitive to blockade with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and was similar to the decrease in the amount of EMCV 3C found with expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM22 (Fig. 7e) , which has been linked to the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C 27 . Treatment with MG-132 also increased the amount of EMCV 3C without influencing the expression of EMCV RNA during infection of primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells npg A r t i c l e s (Fig. 7f,g) . These cells also showed induction of the expression of endogenous PARP9-DTX3L after treatment with IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 and interaction of endogenous PARP9-DTX3L with STAT1 (Fig. 7h) .",

            "text": "We also found that DTX3L localized with EMCV 3C and STAT1 at nuclear and cytosolic sites in EMCV-infected U3A cells, as assessed by immunostaining of U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells at 4-6 h after infection (Fig. 8a) , consistent with localization of EMCV 3C reported before 25, 28, 29 . In addition, we found that DTX3L interacted with EMCV 3C and STAT1 as well as with PARP9, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from U3A-STAT1-PARP9-DTX3L cells with or without treatment with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 8b) , consistent with preserved formation of the PARP9-DTX3L-STAT1 complex despite any additional (potentially competing) interaction with EMCV 3C. Similarly, we detected binding of DTX3L to the IFIT1 promoter in (Fig. 8c) , consistent with EMCV 3C-assisted trafficking of PARP9-DTX3L to the nucleus and the loss of nuclear integrity during picornavirus infection. The binding of DTX3L to this promoter was inhibited in U3A-STAT1-PARP9M-DTX3LM cells (Fig. 8c) , consistent with a decrease in chromatin accessibility (Fig. 5d) . The findings reported above raised the possibility that DTX3L might contain a distinct domain for direct targeting of viral 3C proteases for ubiquitination. Indeed, by using recombinant proteins in an in vitro ubiquitination assay, we found that DTX3L ubiquitinated EMCV 3C (Fig. 8d) . The ubiquitination of EMCV 3C by DTX3L was not affected by titration of various amounts of recombinant PARP9 into the in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 8e) , which ruled against the possibility of competition between the two proteins for binding to their substrate. We confirmed specificity for the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C by purification of the histidine-and V5-tagged ubiquitinated EMCV 3C reaction product with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Fig. 8f) . DTX3L also ubiquitinated the related human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease (Fig. 8g) that exhibits a pattern of early localization to the nucleus and late localization to the cytosol during infection similar to that of the EMCV 3C protease 30 . In vitro ubiquitination assays further showed that DTX3L did not require PARP9 for activity against EMCV 3C or HRV 3C (Fig. 8d-g) and that DTX3L was able to mediate Lys48 (K48)-linked ubiquitination of EMCV 3C (Fig. 8h) . Recombinant DTX3L did not ubiquitinate the respiratory syncytial virus nonstructural protein NS1 (Fig. 8i) , which is linked to ubiquitination-dependent degradation of host proteins 31 ; this indicated that ubiquitination by DTX3L was at least somewhat specific to viral 3C proteases. DTX3L-delD3 and even DTX3L-RDTXH alone maintained ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (Fig. 8j) , which suggested that the RING and DTXH domains of DTX3L mediated ubiquitination and substrate recognition. Through the use of biolayer interferometry (a system for measuring protein interactions in real time), we were able to detect concentration-dependent interactions between recombinant DTX3L-RDTXH and both EMCV 3C and HRV 3C (Fig. 8k) . Thus, the RING-DTXH domains of DTX3L were sufficient for the recognition of EMCV 3C and HRV 3C proteases and complemented the ability of the D1-D3 domains of DTX3L to bind A r t i c l e s PARP9-STAT1. In addition, using co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect V5-labeled EMCV 3C and hemagglutinin-labeled ubiquitin, we found that the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C was lower in HEK293T cells expressing PARP9M-DTX3LM than in those expressing PARP9-DTX3L (Fig. 8l) . Together these results indicated that PARP9-DTX3L interacted with viral 3C proteases to target them for degradation and thus attacked the pathogen directly, in concert with interaction at ISG promoters to enhance the host response to viruses.",

            "text": "Our study has shown that a single molecular complex, PARP9-DTX3L, mediated ubiquitination of both host histones and viral npg A r t i c l e s proteases to enhance interferon-dependent immunity and thereby control viral infection. We identified PARP9 and DTX3L on the basis of their increased expression in a gain-of-function system wherein modification of STAT1 to STAT1-CC (containing two cysteine substitutions in the Src homology 2 domain) enhanced the response to type I and II interferons and thereby broadly and safely provided protection against otherwise lethal viral infections in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis of this enhanced interferon responsiveness showed that PARP9 interacted with DTX3L and STAT1 and functioned as a chaperone to enhance levels of the PARP9-DTX3L protein complex and STAT1-mediated ISG expression. In addition, DTX3L interacted with a subset of host histones (notably histone H2BJ) and viral proteases (specifically viral 3C proteases) to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for both of these substrates. By targeting these substrates, DTX3L tailored chromatin accessibility for the expression of a specific subset of ISGs and promoted immunoproteasome-dependent blockade of viral replication. Each of these endpoints contributed separately to the control of viral infection. These findings place PARP9-DTX3L in a new context and establish interferon-driven ubiquitination as a key immunomodulatory step that might be targeted to enhance interferon signaling and control infection. The multifunctional nature of PARP9-DTX3L was based on the use of distinct protein domains for interactions among PARP9, DTX3L, STAT1 and specific ubiquitination substrates (histones and viral 3C proteases). Thus, the dual function of DTX3L was mediated by binding of DTX3L to PARP9 via the D3 domain of DTX3L (to increase the level of DTX3L and its consequent function) and to ubiquitnation substrates via the RDTXH domain of DTX3L (to enable degradation of viral 3C and histone modification). In addition, the D1-D3 domains of DTX3L bound weakly to STAT1, and the macro and PARP domains of PARP9 bound strongly to STAT1, consistent with evidence that PARP9 also interacts with STAT1 via the macro domains of PARP9 in B cell lymphoma cell lines 32 . However, we found that the binding of PARP9-STAT1 was independent of conventional binding of the PARP macro domain to ADP-ribosylated histones described for the DNA-repair response 16, 33 and thus seemed to be specially 'tuned' to the interferon system. Since both STAT1 and the EMCV 3C protease traffic to nuclear and cytosolic sites 25, 28, 29 , binding of PARP9-DTX3L to STAT1 and EMCV 3C would allow at least two aids for the PARP9-DTX3L complex to also traffic to these two sites. This fits with detection of the PARP9-DTX3L-STAT1-EMCV 3C complex at both sites during infection and the ability of the PARP9-DTX3L complex to control viral and host gene expression in the nucleus and viral assembly in the cytoplasm. Since we also found that the PARP-DTX3L-STAT1 interaction occurred at baseline, the complex seemed to be ready in advance of infection. Moreover, PARP9 enhanced the level of DTX3L protein, and PARP9-DTX3L in turn promoted the expression of PARP9 and DTX3L, so that formation of the PARP9-DTX3L complex was also able to auto-amplify in response to the interferon production that developed after infection.",

            "text": "The properties of PARP9-DTX3L we have reported here appear to be distinct from those of other members of the PARP family in terms of the antiviral or interferon response. For example, PARP1 directly 'poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates' viral proteins to control viral replication 34, 35 . In contrast, PARP9 completely lacks PARP enzymatic activity. PARP13 (ZAP) interacts directly with viral proteins but recruits the RNA exosome to mediate degradation without a ubiquitination mechanism 36 , and a shorter isoform of PARP13 (ZAPS) associates with the RNA helicase RIG-I to increase expression of interferons and other cytokines as an antiviral mechanism 37 . PARP12L, PARP7 and PARP10 might also have some antiviral activity, but the basis for this activity has been linked to the translation of viral and cellular RNA 38 . PARP14 regulates the activity of STAT6, but in contrast to results obtained for PARP9-DTX3L, the enzymatic activity of PARP was again required, no E3 ligase partner was identified, and DNA binding was undetectable 39 . In addition, we found no decrease in the level or function of STAT1 after overexpression of PARP9-DTX3L. Therefore, the action of PARP9-DTX3L was also distinct from that of E3 ubiquitin ligases that target STAT1 to downregulate interferon signaling 40 .",

            "text": "The identification of the actions of PARP9-DTX3L could provide valuable lessons for harnessing a safe reserve in the interferon signaling pathway for therapeutic benefit. In particular, we learned that PARP9-DTX3L contained modules for interaction with each other and with STAT1, specific cellular histones and viral 3C proteases to control viral infection at two levels (expression of host ISGs and degradation of viral 3C proteases) and two cellular sites (nucleus and cytoplasm). It therefore seems to be critical to understand and retain the multifunctional nature of PARP9-DTX3L to safely and effectively enhance interferon signal performance. We also learned that PARP9-DTX3L was especially suited to control viral 3C proteases, which, along with 3C-like proteases, are required for the wide range of common picornaviruses and other important pathogens in the picornavirus-like supercluster that includes certain coronaviruses and caliciviruses 41 . Thus, PARP9-DTX3L provides a particular 'road map' to guide the translation of these results toward a broad-acting next-generation therapeutic for this class of viruses. Indeed, small-molecule interferon signal-enhancer compounds have been identified in a cell-based screen for ISRE-driven luciferase reporter activity and have been shown to increase host ISG expression and control the level of EMCV and HRV in 2fTGH cells and primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells 42 . Whether these compounds also promote the degradation of viral 3C proteases and depend on PARP9-DTX3L expression for antiviral activity still needs to be determined. Nonetheless, small-molecule interferon signalenhancer-type agents that mimic the antiviral mechanism of STAT1-CC and PARP9-DTX3L should help to fill the unmet need for protection against the acute illness and chronic inflammatory disease that develop with picornavirus infection 43 and perhaps the need for the treatment of other interferon-sensitive conditions.",

CAG-STAT1 and CAG-STAT1-CC transgenic mice were generated using the pCAGGS vector that carries the cytomegalovirus early enhancer element; the promoter, first exon, and first intron of the chicken \u03b2-actin gene; and the splice acceptor of the rabbit \u03b2-globin gene 44 to generate CAG-STAT1-CC-FLAG and CAG-STAT1-FLAG plasmids. A SalI-and PvuI-digested cDNA encoding CAG-STAT1-CC-FLAG or CAG-STAT1-FLAG was purified and microinjected into C57BL/6J zygotes. Transgenic founders were screened by PCR and then were bred to generate male mice for experiments. To assess interferon responsiveness, mice were treated with recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b2 (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) given by intraperitoneal injection of 2 \u00d7 10 4 or 2 \u00d7 10 5 U, respectively. All mouse strains were maintained on the C57BL6/J background. All mouse studies were performed under an IACUC-sanctioned protocol approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University.Immunoblot analysis.

Gene-expression analysis was performed using Illumina Mouse-WG6 v1.1 BeadChips for mouse samples, and Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 BeadChips for human samples (Illumina). Isolated total RNA was amplified and biotinylated with an Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Kit. Hybridization and scanning of BeadChip arrays was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, with BeadStudio 3.0 software (Illumina). Treatment and conditions were randomized across BeadChip slides to avoid confounding. For bead-level analysis, raw data were exported from BeadStudio. Viral inoculation and monitoring. Mouse EMCV (strain VR-129B) was titered by a viral plaque-forming assay 49 . IAV (strains A/WS/33 and A/Vietnam/1203/04) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (strain ZPC738) were cultured as described [50] [51] [52] . SINV stocks were generated by electroporation of BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells with RNA transcribed from plasmid TOTO 1101 (ref. 53) . Mice were inoculated by intraperitoneal injection of EMCV (3, 1 \u00d7 10 2 , or 1 \u00d7 10 4 PFU in 100 \u00b5l PBS), intranasal delivery of IAV strain A/WS/33 (25 PFU in 30 \u00b5l PBS) or strain A/Vietnam/1203/04 (1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 in 30 \u00b5l PBS), or subcutaneous injection of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (16 PFU in 100 \u00b5l PBS). Infected tissues were either fixed in 10% formalin for histology or homogenized for plaque-forming or TCID 50 assay. Cell cultures were inoculated as described 31 . Cell supernatants were used for plaque-forming or TCID 50 analysis and real-time quantitative PCR assays as described [50] [51] [52] 54 . Cell lysates were used for isolation of RNA with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) or for immunoblot analysis of EMCV proteins. For inhibition of PSMB8, cells were treated for 24 or 48 h with ONX-0914 (PR-957; Xcess Biosciences) at 0.1 \u00b5M, followed by infection for 6 h with EMCV (MOI 1), then were lysed for immunoblot analysis with antibody to EMCV 3C 45 . Real-time quantitative PCR for viral RNA was performed as described above with specific forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 7) .Cell line and primary-culture cell generation. The U3A cell line was obtained from G. Stark, and STAT1 deficiency was confirmed as described 11 After washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, mAb to FLAG (M2; Sigma) was applied, followed by incubation for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C and then additional washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated npg anti-mouse (7076; Cell Signaling) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C, and binding was detected with a TMB 2 component Substrate Kit (KPL). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 N sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 450 nm was determined with a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices).In the second set of experiments, binding of the PARP macro domain was assayed as described 21, 22 . Cell lysates containing 1 mg protein in 1 ml of a solution of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, and HALT inhibitor cocktail were added to 25 \u00b5l EZView Red FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), followed by incubation overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Beads were then washed, followed by incubation overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 225 pmole (3 \u00b5l) of poly-ADPribosylated PARP1 (PARP-PAR; Trevigen) in 500 \u00b5l of the same buffer used for lysate binding. The complex was eluted with 200 \u00b5g/ml FLAG peptide in TBS with HALT inhibitor cocktail. Samples were then cleared by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblot analysis.CHART PCR assay. CHART PCR assays were performed as described 57 . Cells were treated for 0.5, 4 or 12 h with IFN-\u03b2 (1000 U/ml). The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mM spermine, and 0.5 mM spermidine) , followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min to pellet the nuclei. Nuclei were then suspended in the recommended New England BioLabs buffer (total volume of 50 \u00b5l) and 8 units of AvrII was added to initiate the digestion reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. The digested genomic DNA was purified with a QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen). CHART PCR assays for the human IFIT1 promoter were performed with the following forward and reverse primers: 5\u2032-CAGCAGGAATT CCGCTAGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCCAATGGTGTAAGCTGTGG-3\u2032 and the probe: 5\u2032-TG TGTCCTTGCAAGTTGGA to cover ISRE sequence. Normalization of AvrII-cutting DNA samples was performed by real-time PCR against 2 kilobases of upstream genomic sequence of ISRE site lacking the AvrII restriction site. The following primers and probe were used for this PCR: 5\u2032-CAT AACTGGTCAGTCCCTTGC-3\u2032 as a forward primer and 5\u2032-TCAGCACTAGG TTGTGAGTTCG-3\u2032 as a reverse primers, and 5\u2032-AGCCCAGCTTAGACTCCT-3\u2032 as the probe 58 . The relative accessible chromatin DNA was calculated as follows: value for AvrII-cutting sample stimulated with IFN-\u03b2 (1000 U/ml) divided by value for AvrII-cutting samples not stimulated with IFN-\u03b2.Ubiquitin proteome microarray. Possible substrates of DTX3L were identified with a 17,000-protein microarray (E3 Substrate ID; MA102) from CDI Laboratories. Microarrays were incubated with recombinant E1 ubiquitinactivating enzyme, E2 (UBE2D1) ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubiquitin, and ATP with or without recombinant DTX3L, and ubiquitinated substrates were detected with tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs) 59 with a system from LifeSensors. Comparison of conditions with and without DTX3L were analyzed by published methods 55 and by methods described below for analysis of gene-expression microarrays. For data analysis, data files were generated by GenePix software containing signal intensities from the test sample (with DTX3L added) and background control sample (without DTX3L added). The median intensity values were processed with R software package limma for the following: background correction with the saddle model; normalization by positive-control spots (for example, IgG555/647); and additional normalization by array printer tip and location. By this normalization process, an M value (log 2 test \u2212 log 2 control value) and an A value [(log 2 test + log 2 control value)/2] were generated for each spot on the array. All proteins with an M value of <0, indicative of a lower signal in the test sample than in the control sample, were removed without further analysis. For the remaining proteins, the M values of duplicate spots for a protein on the array were subjected to a paired t-test to determine statistical significance.Native ChIP assays. To detect histone post-translational modifications, native ChIP was used as described with minor modifications 60 30 min, and the nuclei-containing pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of digestion buffer and then micrococcal nuclease (100 units in 1 \u00b5l; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, followed by incubation for 7 min at 37 \u00b0C. Nucleosomes were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of N-ChIP dialysis buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA), and then dialyzed overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was separated by electrophoresis through a 2.0% agarose gel and analyzed by immunoprecipitation by the same procedure as for X-ChIP but with mouse mAb to histone H2B-Ub (56; Millipore), antibody to histone H3 trimethylated at Lys4 (ab1012; Abcam) or rabbit antibody to histone H2B (07-371; Millipore).Ubiquitination assays in HEK293T cells. For confirmation of DTX3LM expression, HEK293T cells were transfected for 36 h with expression vectors for FLAG-PARP9-c-Myc-DTX3L or FLAG-PARP9M-c-Myc-DTX3LM, then were incubated for 14 h with 20 \u00b5M MG-132 (Enzo Life Sciences) and then subjected to lysis and Immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz). For analysis of the degradation of EMCV 3C, cDNA encoding EMCV 3C was amplified from EMCV virus stock, its sequence was confirmed by sequencing, then it was tagged with sequence encoding V5 and inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1. The plasmid pCI-His-Ub (31815; Addgene) was a gift from A. Winoto (University of California, Berkeley), and plasmid pHA-Ubiquitin (18712; Addgene) was a gift from E. Yeh (University of Texas, Houston). The plasmid encoding TRIM22 was from GeneCopoeia. Cells were transfected with vectors encoding V5-EMCV 3C and His-Ub using X-trem-eGene 9 (Roche) and, 36 h later, were treated for 14 h with 20 \u00b5M MG-132 (or not) before lysis and Immunoblot analysis. For analysis of the ubiquitination of EMCV 3C, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb to V5 conjugated to agarose (V5-10; Sigma), followed by elution with 1% SDS, subsequent dilution to 0.1% SDS, reprecipitation with mAb to V5 (identified above), and immunoblot analysis with mAb to HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-7; Sigma) followed by anti-V5 (identified above).In vitro ubiquitination assay with recombinant proteins. Sequence encoding V5-EMCV 3C, V5-HRV-A16 3C (from HRV-A16 obtained from J. Gern, University of Wisconsin), c-Myc-DTX3L-delD3 or c-Myc-DTX3L-RDTXH was cloned into plasmid pET28a as an amino-terminal hexahistidine-tagged construct, followed by transformation into Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen), and expression as soluble proteins that were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography followed by gel-filtration chromatography. The purified protein was concentrated to 10-20 mg/ml and was stored in a buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl. Ubiquitination reactions were carried out in a 50-\u00b5l reaction mixture consisting of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 \u00b5g His-V5-EMCV 3C or His-V5-HRV 3C, 1 \u00b5g HA-Ub (Boston Biochem), 0.3 \u00b5g E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (Uba1; Boston Biochem), 0.6 \u00b5g E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UbcH5a; Boston Biochem) and 0.5 \u00b5g DTX3L (Origene). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and was separated by SDS-PAGE 14 . Antibody to HA-tagged ubiquitin (3933; Cell Signaling Technology) and antibody to K48linkage-specific polyubiquitin (4289; Cell Signaling Technology) were used for the detection of ubiquitinated protein. For experiments with combinations of PARP9 and DTX3L, various amounts of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-His-PARP9 (Abcam) and DTX3L were added to the reaction mixture. Respiratory syncytial virus NS1 protein (obtained from G. Amarasinghe, Washington University) was tested in the same way.Biolayer interferometry assay. Sequence encoding DTX3L-RING-DTXH (amino acids 555-740) was cloned into plasmid pET28a as an aminoterminal hexahistidine-tagged construct, and its sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The protein was purified by the procedure used for EMCV 3C and HRV-3C, described above. The binding of DTX3L-RING-DTXH to EMCV 3C and HRV 3C was assessed using biolayer interferometry with an Octet (ForteBio). Streptavidin-coated biosensors from ForteBio were used for capture of biotinylated proteins onto the surface of the sensor. After baseline was reached, sensors were moved to association step for 300 s and then dissociation for 300 s. Curves were corrected by subtraction of signal from a reference pin. The running buffer consisted of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, and 1% BSA. npg Statistical analysis. A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was used to assess statistical significance between means. Mouse survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis.",
