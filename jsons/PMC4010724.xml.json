            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that affects domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals [2, 77]. Despite all the information accumulated over the years on many aspects of FMD basic biology, there is still a lack of information regarding FMD virus transmission, maintenance, virulence and host range. Although FMD is referred to as a single disease [18], the causative agent of the disease, FMD virus (FMDV), consists of seven immunologically distinct serotypes [23, 24]. The FMDV serotypes, i.e., A, O, C, Asia 1 and the South African Territories (SAT) types 1, 2 and 3, have different global geographical distribution patterns [8\u201310, 18, 44, 73, 88] and are endemic in many countries. Even on the African continent, the distribution of serotypes is variable, with the SAT serotypes occurring in most regions of sub-Saharan Africa but A and O confined mostly to the central and northern parts of the region [88]. Mortality is usually low, but morbidity can reach 100 % and therefore remains a major economic concern for livestock health in many developing countries and a continued threat to disease-free countries [44]. The eradication and control of FMDV in Africa is complex and difficult due to the role of wildlife in virus spread and maintenance [82] and the presence of six of the seven serotypes, i.e., A, O, C, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3. Serotype C has not been reported since 2004 [22].",

            "text": "FMDV is a non-enveloped virus containing a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity in the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae [1, 2, 27]. The large open reading frame (ORF) of ~6,996 nt, which differs in length between the different serotypes [20], encodes a single polypeptide, which is co- and posttranslationally cleaved by viral proteases to give rise to the structural and non-structural proteins [3, 13, 55, 67]. Ten of the 13 cleavage events are catalysed by the virally encoded 3C protease [15, 58, 67, 78]. Translation takes place from a single open reading frame by a cap-independent mechanism at the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [49], located in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR). There are two different sites on the RNA at which the initiation of protein synthesis occurs, resulting in the generation of two forms of L proteinase (Lpro), Lb and the less abundant Lab, where Lb is the truncated version, which arises after the initiation of translation at the second AUG start codon [13]. Lab and Lb can cleave the L/P1 junction and ensure the proteolytic degradation of the cellular cap-binding protein complex (eIF4G), which results in the shutoff of host translation [22]. The P1 region is the viral capsid precursor and consists of the proteins 1A (VP4), 1B (VP2), 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1). The antigenicity of the viral particles is dependent on the amino acid (aa) residues that are exposed on the surface of the capsid [56, 85]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the external capsid proteins play a role in binding to the FMDV cell-surface receptors, i.e., the RGD-dependant integrins [14, 25, 37\u201339, 59, 60] and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [4, 36, 68].",

This has resulted in the need for multiple vaccine strains required for each serotype to cover the antigenic diversity when using vaccination as a control option [26]. In Africa and countries bordering Europe, the disease is mainly controlled using vaccination and restriction of animal movement. Thus, it is imperative to obtain as much information as possible regarding the FMDV prevalent on the African continent to further our knowledge on FMD epidemiology, define genetic relationships of viruses causing outbreaks [45, 47] and to enable better control strategies by successful vaccine development.",

Furthermore, the phylogeny is indicative of the transboundary spread of FMDV in Africa among the East African countries, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania, that are in close proximity to each other, which is also true for the West African countries, i.e. Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Senegal. The groupings also indicated that the East African and West African viruses fall into separate large groups. Another well-supported grouping was observed for the P1, 1B and 1C trees (all methodologies) for O/UGA/1/75, O/UGA/6/76 and O/UGA/17/98, with a maximum of 15.1 % nt and 6.5 % aa substitutions in any pairwise alignment.

This suggests that the African viruses share similarities or are closely related when comparing the L sequences, irrespective of serotype. Taking into account the extensive, uncontrolled movement of animals across the borders and the ease of virus spread and infection of multiple serotypes in one animal, the role of recombination events in the genetic diversification of FMDV cannot be excluded. Although we did not perform a study on the occurrence of recombination, the similarities present between FMDV A and O L sequences could be due to the occurrence of intertypic recombination events [30, 40\u201342, 86].",

            "text": "Due to the high mutation rates of FMDV, it is likely that even brief epidemics might result in the generation of substantial antigenic variability [35]. However, the adaptive significance of this variation remains unclear [34]. The antigenicity of FMDV is attributed to the aa residues that are exposed on the surface of the capsid [56]. An important immunogenic determinant, the 1D G-H loop [3], exhibited a high degree of variation for the A and O isolates included in this study. Consequently, aa changes in this region are most likely involved in the appearance of novel antigenic types. Analyses of antigenic sites of picornaviruses have been carried out using neutralising monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to select and screen Mab-resistant mutants. Sequence analysis of these mutants resulted in the identification of five antigenic sites of serotype O virus, i.e., O1 Kaufbeuren [21, 44], and six sites for the FMDV A viruses [44]. Alignments of the aa sequences of the African A and O viruses indicated that the regions of variability identified corresponded to the known antigenic sites, which points to the fact that the location of antigenic sites are structurally conserved for the African A and O viruses. In addition to these sites, other regions of variability were identified for both the FMDV O and A African isolates from the aa variability plots. These regions could potentially be antigenic determinants, which may be difficult to map by the classical methodology of MAb-resistant escape mutants. We have recently shown that an approach combining sequence variation with structural data and antigenic variation results in the reasonably accurate identification of novel antigenic determinants on the virion surface [65].",

A comparison of the L/P1 cleavage sequence at the C-terminus of the L protein and N-terminus of the 1A protein of the FMDV non-African A types revealed a sequence of R(Q/W)KLK*GAGQ (* indicates cleaved peptide bond), whereas the African A types included in this study had the sequence K(R)R(K)LK*GAGQ (results not shown). Both the FMDV non-African and African O types revealed a sequence of (K/R)(K/R)L(K/R)*GAGQ (* indicates cleaved peptide bond) (results not shown). These observations compared well with the Lpro/1A junction previously described for serotypes A, O and C [76], where the residues K(R)R(K)LK(R) at the Lpro C terminus and the GAGQ at the 1A N terminus were observed. These results suggest that for all the A and O types included in this study, the conserved sequence XXLK(R)*GAGQ (where X is either K or R) is sufficient for L/P1 cleavage by Lpro.",

Overall, the aa sequence variation observed for the FMDV A and O viruses included in this study showed that the A viruses exhibited more variation, possibly indicating that the A viruses evolved rapidly, which supports studies by Bachrach [2] and Brooksby [19]. Additionally, Tully and Fares [84] showed that among all of the FMDV serotypes, serotype A is the most divergent and that adaptive evolution has occurred in the 3C protease (involved in RNA replication and processing of the polyprotein) and 2B (involved in membrane rearrangements), which supports the hypothesis of selection for faster replication in serotype A.",

Interestingly, in this study, it was shown that O/KEN/10/95 was the only African virus to have this Arg residue at residue 56 of 1C, and it was indeed able to replicate in CHO-K1 cells. However this virus has been passaged three times on IB-RS-2 cells, and it is possible that the mutation arose during cell culture passage.
