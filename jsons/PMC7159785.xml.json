Previous studies that evaluated the correlation between bronchiolitis and asthma in infants defined bronchiolitis as a wheezing episode in infants younger than 24 months 18, 19, 20. Our decision to study a homogeneous group of infants with a restricted clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis allowed us to exclude infants with various clinical entities, such as the first wheezing episode. In addition, we simultaneously studied the presence of 14 respiratory viruses, whereas most of the previous studies on the correlation between bronchiolitis and wheezing only enrolled infants with RSV bronchiolitis, during acute bronchiolitis 11, 21. The simultaneous evaluation of 14 different respiratory viruses allowed us to compare, for the first time, the influence of each virus on the development of recurrent wheezing after bronchiolitis.",

A major study by Sigurs et al. followed 47 infants hospitalised for RSV bronchiolitis and 93 control children for 18 years 24. Their definition of bronchiolitis was similar to ours, but it only included infants with RSV infections. It found a strong correlation between RSV infection and wheezing after a three\u2010year follow\u2010up. However, if their study was appropriately designed, the main result of the correlation between RSV bronchiolitis and wheezing might be expected, because acute bronchiolitis on its own is a well\u2010known risk factor to develop wheezing, regardless of the viral aetiology.",

By defining bronchiolitis as a wheezing episode in infants younger than 24 months, they might have included infants with wheezing, but they were unable to detect other respiratory viruses in infants with non\u2010RSV bronchiolitis. In contrast, when Koponen et al. 26 looked at a cohort of infants aged less than six months hospitalised for bronchiolitis, they found that the risk of asthma was lower after RSV bronchiolitis than after bronchiolitis caused by other respiratory viruses. The study retrospectively analysed the presence of nine viruses during acute bronchiolitis, but no single virus was predominant in the non\u2010RSV group with current asthma. To our knowledge, our study is the first to simultaneously compare 14 respiratory viruses and only show a correlation between rhinovirus bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing at the age of three years. These findings confirm previous reports that rhinovirus infections in the first year of life are associated with wheezing and asthma 27. If other studies confirm our latest findings, the major viruses that contribute to the development of recurrent wheezing after bronchiolitis might be rhinoviruses rather than RSV. Further studies are needed to clarify this important finding.",

Other studies on bronchiolitis also found that blood eosinophilia was a risk factor for the development of persistent wheezing and asthma 28, 29. This finding agrees with Ehlenfield et al.'s conclusion that eosinophilia during bronchiolitis predicts the development of persistent wheezing later in childhood 30.",

First, children with recurrent wheezing had fewer chest X\u2010ray consolidations than children with occasional wheezing and without wheezing, and this finding confirmed our previous study on recurrent wheezing one year after bronchiolitis 14. Second, children with recurrent wheezing had less severe bronchiolitis than infants with occasional wheezing and without wheezing. Unfortunately, our findings in this study prevent us from determining whether the severity of the disease really influences the development of wheezing, because we only studied infants who had been hospitalised for severe bronchiolitis and we have no data about the outcome of mild bronchiolitis in infants who were not hospitalised.",

Another limitation was the poor viral detection rate already discussed in our previous paper. Finally, we could not test all the rhinoviruses detected for rhinovirus subtypes, in particular type C.",
