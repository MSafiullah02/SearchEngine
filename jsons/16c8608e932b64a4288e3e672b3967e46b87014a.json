Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-35 CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating their spread across countries. In this study, 36 we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 59 countries during 37 the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, 38 we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each 39 mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic 40 period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 716 site 41 mutations, of which 457 (64%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated 42 alleles revealed the presence of 39 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including 10 43 hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in 44 six genes of SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map 45 revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring 46 mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Thus, evolution over time has 47",

In this study, we characterized the genetic variations in a large 282 population of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (3,067). Our results showed a diversity of mutations 283 detected with different frequencies. Overall, more than 450 non-synonymous mutations in 284 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified. The orf1ab gene contains 16 non-structural 285 proteins (NSP1-NSP16) (22), and harbored more than 50 % of the frequent mutations, with 286 a high mutation number 117, 61, and 61 in the NSP3, NSP12, and NSP2 Respectively. 287 Both NSP2 and NSP3 were reported to be essential for correcting virus replication errors 288 (23). On the other, hand recent studies have suggested that mutations falling in the 289 endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the NSP2 protein, could explain why this 290 virus is more contagious than SARS (24). The Replication enzymes NSP12 to NSP16 have 291 been reported as antiviral targets for SARS-CoV (25). In the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we 292 found that NSP12 to NSP15 harbored nine recurrent non-synonymous mutations. Among 293 them, eight identified as new mutations, including three (M4555T, T4847I, T5020I) in 294 NSP12-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, three (V5661A, P5703L and M5865V) in 295 NSP13-Helicase, two (I6525T, Ter6668W) in NSP15-EndoRNAse. However, these new 296 mutations must be taken into account when developing a vaccine using the ORF1ab protein 297 sequences as a therapeutic target. 298 A high number of mutations were identified in the spike protein, an important determinant 299 in pathogenicity that allows the virion attachment to the cell membrane by interacting with 300 the host ACE2 receptor (26). Among all the frequent mutations in this protein, the V483A 301 mutation has been identified in this receptor and found mainly in SARS-CoV-2 genomes 302 isolated from USA. This result is consistent with the study of Junxian et al. (27). Eight 303 stains from china, USA and France harbored V367F mutation previously described to 304 enhance the affinity with ACE2 receptor (27). genes harboring hotspot mutations belong to the core genome. 312 Thus, under normal circumstances genomic variation increase the viruses spread and 313 pathogenicity. This happens when the virus accumulated mutation enables its virulence 314 potential (29). Genomic comparison of the studied population allowed us to gain insights 315 into virus mutations occurrence over time and within different geographic areas. In the 316 SARS-CoV virus, the SNP distribution is not random, and it is more dominant in critical 317 genes for the virus. As it was already found in many studies (20,30). Our results confirmed 318 what was previously described and elucidate the presence of numerous hotspot mutations. 319Besides, Co-occurrence mutations were also common in different countries all along with 320 singleton mutations. In the case of the USA, the singleton mutations are driven by the single 321 group that diverged differently due to the environment, the host, and the number of 322 generations. These mutations are due to the low fidelity of reverse transcriptase (29, 31). 323Spain, Italy, and the US contain a high number of specific mutations which may be the 324 cause of a rapid transmission, especially in the US. These specific mutations may also be 325 correlated with the critical condition in Italy and Spain. 326",

The modelling of context of a SARS-CoV replicon (33). However, it could counteract the host's innate 338 immune response (34). It was proposed that the 3Ecto luminal domain of NSP3 interacts 339 with the large luminal domain of NSP4 (residues 112-164) to \"zip\" the ER membrane and 340 induce discrete membrane formations as an important step in the generation of ER viral 341 replication organelles (35, 36). As we have shown previously by the FEL, MEME and 342 FUBAR methods, the orf1ab 2244 site coding for ILE-1426 is under positive selection 343 pressure and since it is located on the luminal 3ecto domain of the NSP3 protein, this can 344 be explained by a possible host influence on the virus in this domain.The results of selective 345 pressure analysis revealed the presence of several negatively selected residues, one of 346 which is located at the receptor-binding domain (GLN-474) and which is known by its 347 interaction with the GLN24 residue of the human ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 3482) receptor (37). In general, it is well-known that negatively selected sites could indicate a 349 functional constraint and could be useful for drug or vaccine target design, given their 350 conserved nature and therefore less likely to change (38). 351 352Conclusion 353The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a very large impact on health and economy 354 worldwide. Therefore, understanding genetic diversity and virus evolution become a 355 priority in the fight against the disease. Our results show several molecular facets of the 356 relevance of this virus. We identified ten non-synonymous hotspot mutations distributed 357 in six of the virus genes with high frequencies of mutated alleles. We also were able to 358 highlight an increase in mutations accumulation overtime and revealed the existence of 359 three major clades in various geographic regions. Finally, the study allowed us to identify 360 specific haplotypes by geographic location and provides a list of sites under selective 361 pressure that could serve as an interesting avenue for future studies.362 363 shared the full genome data for SARS-CoV-2 in the GISAID database.
