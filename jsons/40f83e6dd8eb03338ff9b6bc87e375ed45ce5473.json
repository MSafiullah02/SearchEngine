We make the case for introducing public health into the core law school curriculum and suggest the content that would be needed to achieve public health literacy among law students. We also argue that public health's focus on populations, aided by the tools of epidemiology, provides a valuable prism for understanding the relationship of individuals and groups and the ways that laws can and ought to affect them. We conclude by urging the development of a body of scholarship and analysis that brings the insights of public health to bear on legal questions.",

For over a hundred years, legal scholars have stressed the importance of introducing lawyers to the social, economic, and political context in which the law operates. They have also counseled the value of interclisciplinary analysis. In 7he Path of the Luw, for example, Justice Oliver Holmes scolded the legal profession for its belief that law exists apart from the world in which it operates. He argued that lawyers should be trained to understand \"the social advantage on which the rule they lay clown must be justified.,.\"\" Following in Holmes' footsteps in the early twentieth centuly, the legal realists asserted the inipomnce of the facts, out there in the world, to legal analysis. In their \"revolt against fonnalism,\" legal realists suessecl the value of the social sciences and empirical analysis to legal decision making.12",

The provision of this context to Lochnermay not change a student's ultimate opinion about whether the case was correctly decided, but it may shed new light on the decision.

United Stares, the Supreme Court r e v d its analysis of congressional power under the commerce clause, making it more difficult for Congress to enact regulatory legislation.a This constriction of congressional power appeared to derive, in part, from the Court's concern for safeguarding the traditional police powers of the states.29 Underlying that concern was the assumption that police powers constitute a relatively static set of powers, aimed at protecting the public's health and safety, and that these powers have traditionally been the exclusive province of the states. An understanding of public health history, however, makes problematic the notion that public health powers have been or can be the exclusive domain of the statesM Real world public health context intrudes. An analysis of public health problems in the modern global environment-from SARS3' to the question of youth violence32 at issue in Lopez--raises doubt about the ability of states acting alone to protect the public from such hazards. This analysis does not demonstrate that the Supreme Court was wrong in Lopez-. Certainly the Coun confronted interpretative and federalism problems beyond the scope of public health, but a discussion of the way in which health problems cross state and even national boarders suggests that Lopez' impact may be other than what the Court thought. At least, if the Court believed that it was protecting the police power and thereby the ability of states to safeguard the health and welfare of their populations, it may well have announced a constitutional rule that will result in exactly the opposite outcome, less protection for the health of a pop~lation?~ This may not prove to be so. But only by providmg students with the public health context behind the case can they hUy assess the Court's reasoning, speculate on the case's impact, and understand how constitutional doctrines may affect the lives of populations.",

Merrell Dow Pbumacmticak, lnc.,61 and its progeny have made the debate central to tort litigation in the United States.6z In Daubert, the Supreme Court reconsidered the standards for admission of expert evidence. Rejecting the earlier Fty@ nile as incompatible with the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Court instead required federal judges to act as gatekeepers and determine whether the proffered evidence was \"reliable,\" which the Court claimed, required a determination of whether the evidence was based on a scientifically valid methodology.& In Daubertitself, two justices questioned the wisdom of asking federal trial judges to take on the role of deciding what is good science and what is not, describing the task as akin to asking them to become \"amateur ~cientists.\"~~ Since Daubert, however, in federal coum and many state coum, that is just what has happened.& Because expert witnesses may offer opinions about causation that QIJANTWATIVE AND SCENIWIC REAS0NI\"lN are thought to be useful to the finder of factjury or j u d g e a trial judge is now required to act as a \"gatekeeper\" and decide which expert testimony to admit. The Daubert process-pretrial hearings on the admissibility of expert testimony-now donlinates product liability and toxic tort cases6' Recently, the Data Quality Act68 has extended a Daubert-like process into federal agencies, providing an opportunity to challenge the science used in setting agency policy and in regulatory decision making. This means that every lawyer working with or in government agencies will need to understand science and quantitative reasoning as never before. All these procedures hinge on how lawyers understand and portray science, an important reason why an introduction of public health and scientific decision making is necessary in the core cumculum law school. Lawyers employing the Daubertprocess have spawned a vimal industry designed to inform judges and lawyers about the \"ABC's\" of epidemiology, the scientific method, and statistics.@ These legal pundits on science have expanded on the Court's suggestions in Daubert, creating a check-list approach to assessing whether scientific testimony is relevant and reliable, confusing-often deliberately-the legal concept of causation with how scientists reach conclusions about Little or none of this lawyers' rendition of science has been subjected to scholarly scrutiny by scientists, and legal practitioners and judges, largely uneducated about science and quantitative methods, have wandered far from scientific practice.\" The need for a better understanding of science among lawyers is now plainly evident. Justice Breyer, in his influential critique of the regulatory process and administrative law, has called for a more rigorous understanding of quantitative analysis, including cost-benefit analysis, in determining regulatory standards.\" The National Academy of Sciences has a committee of scientists and lawyers reviewing these issues.73",

Jacobi observed, concerns itself with \"bilateral disputes over health finance, medical injury, and patient's rights...'\" What is missing, he argues, are the \"tools or the perspective\" to address issues that affect populations.78 American constitutional law, too, is famously devoted to analysis and consideration of the rights and interests of individuakn Thus the question of whether a woman can have an abortion is framed as a conflict between a woman's right to privacy versus the rights of the individual fetus.8o The law of race discrimination, which was once understood as recognizing and responding to group harms:' focuses significantly on the needs and interests of individuals, rather than groups!* Although the Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold race-conscious decision making by universities signals some recognition of the importance of group perspectives,B3 it remains me that state policies that disparately disadvantage suspect classes are not held to violate the Constitution even if' the disadvantage to the group is clear and obviously foreseeable.& Only when the state, anthropomorphized as if it were also an individual, intentionally aims at disadvantaging one or more people on the basis of their membership in a suspect class, is the Constitution found to be offended.us Even tort law, the field of common law most focused on population-based concerns, remains heavily influenced by individualism. As scholars have noted, traditional tort law, prior to the so-called 1Ws \"torts revolution,\" assumed that \"individualism outranks concerns for others.\"& These tenets remain ensconced in the field, for example, in the noduty rule that many states continue to affirm!' Perhaps the single most influential critique of traditional tort law emerges from scholars and judges who believe that the primary goal of tort law should be the maximization of economic efficiency.w While this position postulates the The dominating individualism of American law has come under sustained critique in recent decades from: fenunist scholars who postulate the importance of relationships;w critical race scholars who point out the need to understand the position of identity groups;\" ancl communitarians who stress the primacy of Nevertheless, these critics, remain just that: critics of the prevailing regime. Their influence is occasionally evident in case law, but they have largely failed to alter the status quo. Perhaps even more impoitantly, as David Ortiz has noted, in many subtle but fundamental ways these critics share many of the individualistic premises of the jurisprudence they critique9~-ofien reifying groups or communities, treating them as if they were, in essence, individuals.",

For example, debates about whether government should enact apparently paternalistic laws, such as those requiring motorcycle helmet laws, often presume that individuals can make independent choices and that they can control the probabilities of their being affected by different risks.'\" Rose's work questions that assumption and provides legal decision makers with a different perspective for analyzing so-called paternalistic laws. On the one hand, a seat belt law niay not actually be paternalistic, if we recognize that inciivicluals cannot in fact control the risks to which they are exposed. On the other hand, such laws may be inefficient ways of reducing highway deaths if in fact they focus on altering individual rather than population behavior. As Beauchamp and Steinbock argue, \"[tlhe population perspective constnicts a new story about how highway injuries occur in Likewise, a population-based perspective may alter the way we understand relatively new issues, such as the legal responsibility of the food industry for the growing obesity epidernic.lo2 The traditional individualism of American law (and culture) would suggest that in the absence of misrepresentation or the sale of an exceptionally dangerous product, the food industry should not be viewed as responsible for the pr0b1em.l~~ Individuals should be regarded as free and responsible for their own eating and exercising habits as well as the weight gain that ensues.\"\"' A population-based perspective, however, questions whether individuals should be viewed as personally responsible for their own weight. After all, the prevalence of obesity is increasing both across the broad U.S. population and across varied sub-populations.Iw Likewise, the health damage stretches across the population, harming individuals who do not consider themselves in need of weight control or who do not meet the official definition of obesity (BMI greater than 30). In fact, more health damage is likely occurring in the part of the population not identsed as overweight than in the overweight population.'06 This suggests that causes must be understood at a broad, population level. Something is happening to make millions and millions of people make \"choices\" that lead to their gaining weight. Epidemiologists, therefore, are looking to fundamental environmental changes, including the marketing and distribution of food, as well as the way our built environment affects our activity levels.'07 These deeper causes may suggest legal causation should be seen as residing in those parties (corporate and governmental) that perpetuate the obesity-causing environment, or it may suggest a role for affirmative government interventions to alter the environment.Im While adoption of a populationbased perspective does not provide a single or simple determinative analysis of where and how the law should assign responsibility and intervene in the case of obesity, it does suggest a different set of remedies and approaches than would be offered by a more individualistic, marketbased approach, which might focus solely on remedying market failures by giving individuals more information on how to make healthy choices.",
