We provide a concise summary of the manner in which the scientific community has allocated its efforts to this issue in recent decades, and to illuminate trends that emerge from the literature. Our search yielded 620 publications encompassing 139 invasive zooplankton species, with invasive zooplankton reported from every region of the planet-including the Arctic and Antarctic. Most taxa were reported in a small number of publications, with the majority being mentioned in only a single paper. In contrast, approximately half of the surveyed publications concerned just four species: Bythotrephes longimanus, Mnemioposis leidyi, Cercopagis pengoi, and Daphnia lumholtzi. Our survey reveals strong geographic patterns among the literature, with most publications arising from economically developed western nations. We found that the majority of publications pertained to holoplanktonic organisms from freshwater habitats, especially from the North American Great Lakes. Based on these results, we present several recommendations for future research topics that may hold considerable opportunity for growth in our understanding of the invasion process.",

            "text": "Zooplankton constitute a diverse assemblage of microscopic organisms that occupy a crucial intermediate position in the food webs of freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. In transferring energy from primary producers (photosynthetic protists, bacteria, and single-celled plants) to macroscopic invertebrates and fishes, zooplankton have the capacity to shape the dynamics of entire ecosystems. Zooplankton tend to be well adapted for long-range dispersal via a wide range of natural vectors (e.g., airborne resting eggs, aquatic birds, coastal currents- C\u00e1ceres & Soluk, 2002; Frisch et al., 2007) , but anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture, commercial shipping, and recreational boating now provide an unprecedented capacity for dispersal across large geographic distances (Carlton & Geller, 1993; Ruiz et al., 2000; Minchin, 2007) . Accordingly, nonindigenous zooplankton are now reported from bodies of water across nearly every region of the globe, and in many cases have been associated with far ranging ecological and economic impacts (Pimentel et al., 2005; Gollasch 2006; Connelly et al., 2007; Cuhel & Aguilar, 2013) .",

This includes a large number of new invasions like the introduction of the mysid Hemimysis anomala G.O. Sars, 1907 (Pothoven et al., 2007 , the copepod Thermocyclops crassus (Fischer, 1853) (Connolly et al., 2017) , and the rotifer Brachionus leydigii Cohn, 1862 (Connolly et al., 2018) to the North American Great Lakes. Furthermore, some high-profile invaders have greatly expanded their range in recent decades. This includes the western expansion of zebra and quagga mussels (which exhibit planktonic larvae) across the continental United States (Nalepa & Schloesser, 2013) and the spread of the Ctenophore Mnemiospis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1865, to the Baltic Sea and adjacent waters (Hansson, 2006; Javidpour, 2006) . Finally, a number of theoretical and technical developments have also shifted research interests and paradigms in recent decades. This includes a growing interest in the ecological consequences of climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno, 2010; Li et al., 2011; Chapman, 2014) , a decrease in the financial and technological barriers to genetic sequencing (Glenn, 2011; Peterson et al., 2012; Schl\u00f6tterer et al., 2014) , and an increased awareness of the role that disease may play in shaping zooplankton communities (Ebert, 2005; Decaestecker et al., 2007; Sommer et al., 2012; C\u00e1ceres et al., 2014) .",

Note that throughout the text of this manuscript, we employ the general term ''non-indigenous'' in reference to any non-native species, but apply the narrower term ''invasive'' to only those species associated with negative ecological impacts, rapid geographic expansion, or large population sizes (see Davis & Thompson, 2000 for a discussion of this terminology).",

Taxa were identified to the species level in 93% of instances and to the genus level in the remainder. The vast majority of these taxa (90%) exhibited a holoplanktonic lifestyle, with meroplanktonic organisms primarily represented by larval bivalves and jellyfish medusae. Most taxa were documented in a small number of publications, with 63% of taxa mentioned in only a single paper (Fig. 1) . Approximately half of the surveyed publications concerned just four species: Bythotrephes longimanus (Leydig, 1860) (n = 132), Mnemioposis leidyi (n = 82), Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) (n = 52), and Daphnia lumholtzi G.O.

This strong taxonomic bias among the literature likely exists for several reasons. Foremost is the fact that each of these taxa is closely associated with major ecological impacts across large, highly urbanized, and commercially important bodies of water (e.g., The Great Lakes, The Black Sea, and the Baltic Sea). These bodies of water tend to be associated with a large number of scientific institutions and thus receive an overall higher level of scientific scrutiny. Furthermore, the ecosystem impacts of these four invaders have been so pervasive that researchers may find it difficult to avoid considering these invasive species in some mannerregardless of the primary objectives of their studies.",

Comparing our results to this prior survey of the literature, we find a number of notable similarities and differences. Using identical search criteria to those employed in this review, Bollens et al. (2002) identified 252 publications concerning a total of 63 non-indigenous zooplankton taxa. We report a considerable expansion in the total number of reports across a similar span of time (620 articles-a 250% increase) and in the total number of non-indigenous taxa reported (139 taxa-a 220% increase). In the prior review, more than half of the publications (57% of 252) pertained to freshwater environments, which is similar to the proportion that we observed (61% of 620). Bollens et al. (2002) drew particular attention to a relative paucity of studies concerning meroplanktonic organisms (6.0% of 252), which appears to have slightly increased proportionally in recent decades (10% of 620). This earlier survey noted that a relatively low number and proportion of publications concerned community level (17% of 252) and ecosystem impacts (4.0% of 252). We observed a slight increase in the proportion of publications reporting community level impacts in recent decades (25% of 620), but no change in the proportion of publications reporting ecosystem impacts (4.0% of 620).",

This fact may account for the lack of records pertaining to Chinese waters in our survey and may also be a factor in the small number of publications that we surveyed from Latin American nations. Although given the increasing availability of professional services for English translation among the global scientific community, this language barrier may play a lesser role in recent years. While we do not have a quantitative measure of this linguistic bias, there are some anecdotal signs that the geographic trends that we observed are not entirely a matter of language. For example, our search yielded a small number of records from several nations where English is the primary language, such as Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, but a relatively large number of records from France, Brazil, and Japan.",

            "text": "Based upon the results of our survey and our own research experience, we have identified four topics which may present considerable opportunity for further growth in the understanding of zooplankton invasions: genetics, disease, ecosystem impacts, and climate change. In their earlier review, Bollens et al. (2002) reported a striking underutilization of genetic tools in the study of zooplankton invasions. Across the subsequent 18-year period that we reviewed, we report a slight increase in the number of publications with a genetic component, but far below what might be expected given the dramatic reduction in cost and the increased accessibility of genetic sequencing platforms in recent years (Glenn, 2011; Peterson et al., 2012; Goodwin et al., 2016) . We found that only 7% of surveyed articles included a genetic component, with 8 publications on the metabarcoding of organisms in ballast water, 21 publications on invasion history, and 11 publications concerning species identification and/ or taxonomy. Note that the apparent rapid increase in the number of publications with a genetic component (Fig. 4F) is driven by an unusually large value in 2018 alone. This may represent the beginning of an upward trend, or simply an outlying value. Nearly all reviewed genetic studies employed a small set of genetic markers such as cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) or internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), with only a few publications employing next-generation sequencing methods (Ghabooli et al., 2016; Dexter et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018) . Given the power of these tools to reconstruct the demographic history of populations (Estoup & Guillemaud, 2010) , the maturation of eDNA technologies and protocols (Taberlet et al., 2012) , and the constantly decreasing cost of implementation (Peterson et al., 2012) , genetic and genomic tools represent a particularly promising area for growth within the field of invasion biology.",

Parasites and other pathogenic organisms have the capacity to act as major drivers of zooplankton population dynamics (Ebert, 2005; C\u00e1ceres et al., 2014) . In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation for the role that disease may play in shaping seasonal dynamics of plankton communities (Sommer et al., 2012) and the evolution of local populations (Decaestecker et al., 2007; Ebert, 2008) . It has been suggested that escape from pathogenic organisms may play a role in the invasion process (Mack et al., 2000) , and in some cases, the rapid decline of an invader has been attributed to the subsequent arrival of pathogens and parasites from its native range (Simberloff & Gibbons, 2004) . Invaders may also serve as vectors for the introduction of new parasites to native fauna (Mack et al., 2000; Grigorovich et al., 2001) . Despite this wide-ranging set of consequences, our survey contained only 4 publications that examined some aspect of disease among non-indigenous zooplankton. This is clearly a facet of zooplankton invasions which merits greater investigation.",

In the most well-known example, zebra and quagga mussels (which disperse via planktonic larvae) have affected dramatic changes to water clarify and nutrient cycling, and markedly transformed benthic substrate across the invaded North American Great Lakes (Macisaac, 1996; Cuhel & Aguilar, 2013) . While this may represent an extreme case, ecosystem impacts of similar scale have been reported across other species and waterbodies (Kideys et al., 2008; Penk et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 2016) and may be far more common than presently known (Simberloff, 2011) . However, we observed that only a small percentage of the publications that we surveyed (4.0%) explicitly examined ecosystem-level impacts of non-indigenous zooplankton. As surveys of public attitudes regarding non-indigenous species have shown that general ecosystem impacts are a primary concern of public stakeholders (Garc\u00eda-Llorente et al., 2008) , we strongly recommend that researchers consider ecosystem-scale processes and impacts in future work.",

A number of observational studies, laboratory experiments, and modeling efforts indicate that climate change may promote the global spread of invasive species and increased severity of invasion impacts (e.g., Lennon et al., 2001; Stachowicz et al., 2002; Winder et al., 2011; Chapman et al., 2016) . Although many of the publications that we reviewed referenced climate change in some manner, we identified only 7 publications that explicitly tested hypotheses pertaining to climate-invasion linkages. This may be a consequence of the long periods of observation needed to detect climate signals in field-based studies, or the complex relationship between temperature and plankton community dynamics. Nonetheless, we highlight this climate-invasion linkage as an understudied and increasingly relevant facet of zooplankton ecology.",

Our survey shows a potential need for greater examination of the waters associated with less economically developed nations, especially at tropical latitudes.
