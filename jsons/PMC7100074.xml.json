            "text": "Alveolar cells constantly transport Na+ ions from the apical to the basolateral side. Na+ enters the cells through epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) in the apical membrane and is extruded by Na,K-ATPases in the basolateral membrane, creating an osmotic gradient for the movement of fluid out of the alveolar space (1). This active vectorial Na+ transport is mainly responsible for alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and is crucial for postnatal survival, as shown by mice lacking the pore-forming \u03b1-subunit of ENaC (2). Furthermore, survival of adults with acute RDS (ARDS) is related to the efficiency of their AFC (3). Preterm infants with RDS had reduced airway epithelial Na+ transport (4) and reduced ENaC expression (5) compared with preterm infants without RDS or term infants, and decreased AFC has been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of RDS (6). Therefore, mechanisms or treatments to up-regulate lung epithelial vectorial Na+ transport and AFC may improve survival and decrease morbidity of preterm infants and adults with respiratory distress.",

Female sex steroids may also be involved in the regulation of AFC, because women with ARDS have higher AFC and higher survival than males (3), and female preterm infants have a higher survival rate and less pulmonary disease than males (10,11). Moreover, preterm infants suffering from RDS showed a reduced estrogen and progesterone (P) plasma concentration (12,13). In cystic fibrosis, a disease characterized not only by defective Cl\u2212 secretion but also by Na+ hyperabsorption (14), males have a better prognosis (15), possibly because stimulating effects of female sex hormones on Na+ absorption lead to increased mucus thickness. Finally, preterm infants receiving estrogen substitution in a randomized trial had significantly less respiratory distress and higher survival (16).",

The increases of baseline ISC, Iamil, Iouab, ouabmax, and amilmax in monolayers exposed to E2 up to 0.28 \u03bcM (medium 4) are consistent with stimulatory effects on both ENaC and Na, K-ATPase. High concentrations of P (1\u20132.8 \u03bcM, medium 6 and 5) were associated with diminished currents and also a trend toward reduced Na,K-ATPase protein expression, which may indicate toxicity. A high P concentration combined with a low E2 concentration, as in medium 5 (2.7 \u03bcM), predominantly increased ENaC activity, as shown by stimulatory effects on amilmax but not ouabmax. Hence, the decreases of baseline ISC in media 5 and 6 were probably caused by a diminished Na,K-ATPase activity. Smaller stimulatory effects on apical Na+ channel activity were also seen using media 2 and 3, resembling E2 and P concentrations similar to natural conditions during rat gestation (23). It was also shown that the combination of E2 and P (e.g. medium 5 with 0.0037 \u03bcM E2) has a higher impact on epithelial Na+ transport than E2 alone as in medium 2 (0.01 \u03bcM E2). This would suggest a more pronounced influence of P, but considering the effects of medium 3 with a higher P, but lower E2 concentration than medium 4, a more complex interaction between intracellular E2 and P signaling must be assumed. The notion of a physiologic role of female sex steroids on lung epithelial ion transport is further supported by a study of pig fetuses subjected to prenatal pharmacologic E2 and P withdrawal, which resulted in decreased amiloride-sensitive AFC (17).",

            "text": "We demonstrated that \u03b1- and \u03b2-ENaC subunit mRNA expression is enhanced in the media supplemented with E2 and P. The strongest increase of \u03b1-ENaC mRNA was observed for the P-rich medium 5, which was also showing the highest amilmax. Unlike the whole animal experiments (18), we did not find an increase of \u03b3-ENaC mRNA expression but an elevation of \u03b2-ENaC. These results also demonstrate a differential regulation of ENaC subunits by sex steroids. Furthermore, this study shows increased expression of Na,K-ATPase-\u03b21 subunit by E2 and P at all tested concentrations. Overexpression of the \u03b21-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase alone was previously shown to increase vectorial Na+ transport, whereas overexpression of the \u03b11-subunit did not have any effect (21), because the \u03b21-subunit was the rate-limiting component in the assembly of Na,K-ATPases (25,26). Therefore, the observed increased expression of the Na,K-ATPase-\u03b21 subunit might account for the detected elevation of Iouab under E2 supplementation. CFTR mRNA expression was shown to be increased by combined treatment of E2 and P after 24 h (18), which we also demonstrated on the fourth day after hormone supplementation. These data show the impact of E2 and P on the transcriptional level of participating ion transporters. E2 and P supplementation resulted in a trend toward a reduced expression of ER-\u03b2, which has been described for the expression of ER in the brain (27); however, to our knowledge, it has not yet been described in the lung.",

The polyclonal origin of the antibodies resulted in detection of several bands. For evaluation by densitometry, the band with the best-fitting molecular weight was selected. Specificity was further confirmed by experiments with positive controls. Because of the high variability of such measurements, a large number of Western blots would be needed for statistical verification at this effect size. Expression of Na,K-ATPase remained essentially unchanged in culture media 2 and 4. The protein expression results do not completely rule out a minor increase sufficient to produce the electrophysiologically detected changes, because whole cell lysates also include proteins stored in the endoplasmatic reticulum and blotting studies cannot be readily expected to detect small differences, as previously reported (8).",

K+ channels in other tissues have been shown to be controlled by E2 (30,31). It is currently unknown whether K+ channels in epithelial cells are influenced by E2 or P. FDLE cells are known to perform mostly not only Na absorption but also, to a smaller extent, Cl\u2212 secretion (8). Therefore, we used the specific inhibitors of epithelial Na+ transport, amiloride and ouabain, to attribute the effects of hormone supplementation to the ENaC and Na,K-ATPase transport activity. Furthermore, experiments performed in Cl\u2212-free solution yielded similar results (not shown).",

ENaC activity seems to be most strongly stimulated by high P concentrations, whereas the Na,K-ATPase function seems to be mainly controlled by E2, which is a new finding. E2 and P may thus improve AFC and hasten the resolution of pulmonary edema, which may contribute to positive effects of E2 on RDS of infants (10,16) and the sex-related differences in the survival of the ARDS (3). In cystic fibrosis, stimulatory actions of E2 and P may worsen the overactivity of ENaC associated with the disease (14), which may explain why the prognosis of affected males is better than that of females (15).",
