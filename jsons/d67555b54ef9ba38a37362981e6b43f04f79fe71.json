This public health measure, which is necessary to save lives and preserve the healthcare system in the near term, may inadvertently induce lasting health effects with significant implications for older adults. The enactment of social distancing and lockdowns in certain regions has necessitated cancelling routine medical care, screening visits, and elective surgeries. Moreover, older and/or at-risk persons with pre-existing conditions may be afraid to go outside due to fears of being unable to maintain the recommended six feet of distance between themselves and others, or of contracting the virus from contact with surfaces. Per the Feb 28 th Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission, the death rate in confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 rises exponentially with age, escalating from 0.4% among those aged 40-49 years to 3.6% among those aged 60-69 years to 14.8% among those aged >80 years (2) . Moreover, the death rate in those with pre-existing conditions ranges from 6.0% for those with hypertension to 7.3% for those with diabetes to 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease (2) . Given these stark prognoses, social distancing remains the primary defense weapon of choice in the short-term. Nevertheless, the duration of these public health interventions A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t remains unclear given the potential for recurrent outbreaks, leading to concerns about the longer-term health effects of social distancing, including:",

With the closure of cardiac rehab facilities, gyms and fitness studios, and most physical therapy facilities, engagement in daily physical activity will likely experience a steep decline.

Problems with both weight gain and weight loss are feasible under these scenarios, which may detrimentally affect health and both physical and cognitive functioning for months, or even years, to come.4. Limited access to routine health care and/or home care visits may reduce risk of viral transmission but aggravate the onset and progression of chronic disease burden. Specifically, cancellation of screenings, routine clinic visits, and laboratory monitoring visits may lead to improper medication dosage or adherence and failure to recognize new or worsening disease statuses. As providers are reassigned or deployed to alleviate burdens on health care systems, cancellation of routine care visits may leave urgent care or emergency room visits as the only options for those in dire need of medical attention not related to COVID-19, at a time when hospitals need to attend to those left critically ill by the pandemic. Further, uncertainty about transmission risk may lead those in need of care to cancel home health care services, thus increasing the likelihood of improper medication management, self-care, and nutrition.",
