The full-length N gene was amplified from the cDNA templates with the primer pair NO-F and NO-R. The PCR products were purified with Montage PCR reagent sets (Millipore Corporation), digested with BamHI and SalI (Promega Corporation), and ligated into similarly digested plasmid pET-32a (Novagen). The ligation products were transformed in BL21 (DE3; Novagen Inc.), and the recombinant clones were identified by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Various fragments spanning different putative epitopes (Table 2 ) were amplified from the recombinant clone with the full-length N protein gene by different primer combinations and cloned into pET-32a as described above. To produce the target proteins, the recombinant clones were cultured at 37 \u00b0C to A600 = 0.6 and then induced with isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma).

Because each pin was estimated to transfer a 40-pL sample, the calibration curve of FI to the amount of IgG could be calculated (Fig. 2B ). This curve could be used to estimate the amounts of antibodies captured by antigens on the microarray. In general, fragments with higher reactivities captured more antibodies. For example, fragment N4 captured \u223c9.65 pg of IgG, three times the amount captured by F17 (see Fig. S2 in the online Data Supplement).

(15) analyzed epitopes of the N protein, using synthetic peptides, and found that N66 and N371\u2013N404 were important epitopes. Notably, peptides N371 and N385, located at the COOH terminus of the N protein, inhibited the binding of antibodies to the SARS-CoV lysate and bound to antibodies in >94% of the tested sera. N385 had the highest affinity for forming peptide\u2013antibody complexes with SARS serum. In the present study, EP2 (amino acids 51\u201371), which overlaps with N66, was found to be important for antigenicity. In our microarray analyses, the regions located at the COOH terminus were found to be more important than those at the NH2 terminus, which further confirmed the results of a previous study. Wang et al. (17) found that epitopes located at amino acids 161\u2013182 and 471\u2013390 were highly immunogenic, which was also consistent with our results. As indicated in this report, EP4 (amino acids 349\u2013422) carried linear epitopes that gave negative results in microarray analyses but were positive in immunoblotting. A total of four important regions were identified in the N protein, and fragments containing only one of these regions had no or low reactivity, whereas those spanning two or more of these regions had high reactivity. Thus, structural requirements seem to be important for antigenicity of the N protein because a cooperative action is required between these regions. This also showed the important role of conformational epitopes in the antigenicity of the N protein, which could not be obtained by synthetic peptides.",

Sequence analysis indicates that the RNA-binding domain of the SARS-CoV N protein is at amino acids 178\u2013205 (26). Wang et al.(15) found that N177 (amino acids 177\u2013198) was highly immunogenic, and in the present study, EP2 overlaps this region, indicating that this region is important both in its RNA-binding function and its immunogenicity.
