Amidst the development of this infectious disease in 206 countries throughout the world, health care workers remain the main persons involved in the screening and treatment of this condition throughout.",

However, no relation was found between social support and sleep quality (Xiao et al., 2020). As per Cai et al.

Kang et al. (2020) reported that the degree of contact with confirmed or suspected cases and access to psychological materials/resources is related to the extent of mental health disturbances. The degree of contact was directly related whereas the access to psychological help inversely related to the proportion of mental health disturbances. The subject\u2019s self-perceived physical health was poor in participants with higher mental health problems (Kang et al., 2020). The only study from India included in the current review showed that certain positive motivational factors like supportive and proud family and colleagues, positive role models, validation and appreciation by peers/patients, positive caretaking experience, a sense of validation of existence, knowledge and acceptance of the possible inevitability of infection need to be strengthened to boost the morale of HP. As per this study, the negatives associated with patient care include multiple needs of the patients, stigma, need for clear management plans. One solution proposed by the HP interviewed to overcome the negatives include setting up of multidisciplinary teams and screening questionnaires (Mohindra et al., 2020).",
