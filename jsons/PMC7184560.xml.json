The immune system is a system of cells, tissues and their soluble products that recognizes, attacks and destroys entities that could endanger the health of an individual. The normal functioning of the immune system gives rise to immunity, a word derived from the Latin immunitas, meaning \u201cto be exempt from.\u201d This concept originated in the 1500s, before the causes of disease were understood. Survivors who resisted death during a first exposure to a devastating disease and who did not get sick in a subsequent exposure were said to have become \u201cexempt from\u201d the disease, or \u201cimmune.\u201d",

            "text": "In 1796, the English physician Edward Jenner carried out experiments that solidified the birth of immunology as an independent science. At that time, smallpox was a disfiguring and often fatal disorder that decimated whole villages (Plate 1-1\n). Jenner observed that dairymaids and farmers lacked the pock-marked complexions of their fellow citizens, and wondered whether those who worked with cattle might be resistant to smallpox because of their close contact with livestock. Cows of that era often suffered from cowpox disease, a disorder similar to smallpox but much less severe. In an experiment that would be prohibited on ethical grounds today, Jenner deliberately exposed an 8-year-old boy to fluid from a cowpox lesion (Plate 1-2\n). Two months later, he inoculated the same boy with infectious material from a smallpox patient. In this first example of successful vaccination, the boy did not develop smallpox. Jenner\u2019s approach to smallpox prevention was quickly adopted in countries throughout Europe. The modern story of smallpox vaccination and the global eradication of this scourge is one of the most successful public health endeavors in history.In 1967, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a vaccination campaign to eradicate smallpox from the planet, and in 1980 they announced their success. More details about the global eradication of smallpox can be found in Chapter 14.\n",

In Jenner\u2019s day, the cause of infectious disease was still a mystery, and theories of that time did not envision the transmission of disease-causing germs. In 1884, Robert Koch proposed the \u201cgerm theory of disease,\u201d which stated that microbes invisible to the naked eye were responsible for specific illnesses, and the first human disease-causing organisms or pathogens were identified in the late 1800s. At about the same time, Louis Pasteur applied Jenner\u2019s immunization technique for smallpox to the prevention of various animal diseases. Pasteur demonstrated that inoculation with a pathogen that had been weakened in the laboratory could protect against a subsequent exposure to the naturally occurring pathogen. It was Pasteur who coined the term vaccination (from the Latin vaccinus, meaning \u201cderived from cows\u201d) for this procedure, in honor of Jenner\u2019s work. The research of Pasteur and other investigators spurred the evolution of immunology as a science distinct from (but related to) the established fields of microbiology, pathology, biochemistry and histology. Today, immunology can be defined as the study of the cells and tissues that mediate immunity and the investigation of the genes and proteins underlying their function.\nSelected landmark discoveries in immunology and immunologists who have won Nobel Prizes for their work are featured in Appendices A and BAppendice AAppendice B, respectively.\n",

When this homeostasis is disturbed by either trauma, pathogens, or the deregulation of body cells (such occurs in cancer), the immune system responds in an attempt to restore balance. At its simplest level, this response involves identifying and clearing damaged and dying cells from the body. More complex responses have evolved to counteract assault on the body by infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Because these foreign invaders are literally everywhere on Earth and constantly seeking vulnerable hosts, the immune system is constantly occupied with containing attacks from this quarter. Indeed, despite the successful eradication of smallpox and the development of antibiotics, infectious diseases remain among the biggest killers on the planet. Long-standing disorders such as malaria and tuberculosis, as well as \u201cemerging\u201d diseases caused by new pathogens such as West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and H1N1 influenza virus, present ongoing challenges to the immune system.",

In order to reproduce, however, many must penetrate a host\u2019s body or one of its component cells. Infection is defined as the attachment and entry of a pathogen into the host.

Because pathogens are constantly evolving mechanisms to evade or block immune defenses, the immune system must constantly adapt to maintain its effectiveness. It is a continual horse race as to which will be the more successful mechanism: the body\u2019s immune surveillance or the pathogen\u2019s invasion and infection strategy.

One group of scientists believed that immunity depended primarily on the actions of cells that destroyed or removed unwanted material from the body. This clearance process was referred to as cell-mediated immunity. However, another group of researchers was convinced that soluble molecules in the serum of the blood could directly eliminate foreign entities without the need for cellular involvement. In this case, the clearance process was referred to as humoral immunity, a term derived from the historical description of body fluids as \u201chumors.\u201d Today, we know that both cell-mediated and humoral responses occur simultaneously during an immune response and that both are often required for complete clearance of a threat.",

The soluble molecules responsible for humoral immunity are proteins called antibodies, and antibodies are secreted by a particular type of leukocyte. The production of these antibodies and the mounting of cell-mediated immune responses depend on an elaborate signaling system by which leukocytes communicate with each other as well as with other cell types in the body. This signaling is mediated by small secreted proteins called cytokines, which are mainly produced by leukocytes.",

As introduced previously, and as illustrated in Figure 1-4\n, PRMs come in several different forms, some of which are membrane-bound and others of which are soluble. PRMs that are expressed by innate leukocytes are called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are located in the plasma membrane of an innate leukocyte, or are soluble molecules free in the leukocyte\u2019s cytoplasm, or are fixed in the membranes of intracellular vesicles called endosomes. Other PRMs are made by non-leukocytes and are present as soluble molecules free in the extracellular milieu. When these latter PRMs bind to a given PAMP or DAMP, they must then bind to another receptor fixed in a leukocyte membrane in order to trigger the appropriate clearance response. The clearance mechanisms typically induced following PRM or PRR engagement by a DAMP or PAMP are inflammation, phagocytosis, and/or target cell lysis. A brief description of each of these processes follows, with more detail provided in Chapter 3.",

These cytokines in turn drive events responsible for the influx of first innate and later (if necessary) adaptive leukocytes into the site of injury or infection. This influx is part of a process called inflammation or an inflammatory response, and the redness and swelling we commonly associate with inflammation are its outward physical signs. This inflammation is normal and helpful, and, when properly regulated, promotes a localized gathering of the cells and molecules necessary to repair tissue damage and clear pathogens. Once the threat is eliminated, the inflammation resolves naturally with time. However, if the inflammation fails to resolve and becomes chronic, it may become pathological. The powerful molecules secreted by the innate leukocytes participating in the inflammatory response can eventually cause tissue damage and impair immune system function if left to operate unchecked. Thus, properly controlled inflammation is part of a healthy innate response and essential for homeostasis, whereas excessive or prolonged inflammation is immunopathic and undermines homeostasis.",

However, MHC class II molecules are expressed only by certain cell types that can act as specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including DCs, macrophages and activated B cells. In the course of a pathogen attack, APCs can capture the pathogen and/or its products or components, and then display peptides derived from its antigens on MHC class II. When the TCR of a Th effector cell recognizes this pMHC structure, the cell is stimulated to produce cytokines that assist B cells and Tc cells to become fully activated. In this way, Th cells contribute to both humoral and cell-mediated adaptive responses, and are thus crucial for protection against many extracellular and intracellular pathogens. In addition, cytokines secreted by Th cells stimulate innate leukocytes, thereby reinforcing this arm of immunity. The combined efforts of Tc, Th and B lymphocytes and many types of innate leukocytes may be necessary to eliminate a particularly wily invader.",

A constant supply of resting B and T cells is maintained throughout the body, with each lymphocyte expressing its complement of unique antigen receptor proteins. When a pathogen antigen enters the body for the first time, a process of clonal selection takes place in which only those lymphocytes bearing receptors specific for that antigen are triggered to respond. The selected cells leave the resting state and multiply to generate daughter cells all expressing the same antigen-specific BCR or TCR. The differentiation of these daughter cells gives rise to the short-lived effector cells required to eliminate the pathogen, as well as long-lived memory cells that persist in the tissues essentially in a resting state until a subsequent exposure to the same pathogen (Fig. 1-6\n). The attack on the pathogen by this first round of effector cells is called the primary immune response. The second (or subsequent) time that the particular pathogen enters the body, it is met by an expanded army of clonally selected, antigen-specific memory cells that undergo much more rapid differentiation into effector cells than occurred during the first antigen encounter. The result is a stronger and faster secondary immune response that eliminates the pathogen before it can cause illness. New populations of memory cells are also produced during the secondary response, ensuring that the host maintains long-term or even lifelong immunity to that pathogen.Clonal selection is explained in detail in Chapter 5 for B cells and in Chapter 9 for T cells.\nNOTE: The generation of protective memory lymphocytes is the basis of vaccination. A healthy person is immunized with a vaccine containing pathogen antigens in order to provoke the production of memory cells that will prevent disease from developing if the individual is ever naturally infected by that pathogen. Vaccination is described in detail in Chapter 14.\n",

The genes encoding antigen receptors are not individual continuous entities. Rather, the BCR and TCR genes are assembled from a large collection of pre-existing gene segments by a mechanism called somatic recombination. A single, random combination of gene segments is thus created in each developing lymphocyte. As a result, a lymphocyte population is generated in which the antigen receptor proteins are vastly diverse in specificity because they are encoded by hundreds of thousands of different DNA sequences. In the case of B cells, additional mutational mechanisms operate that result in further structural diversification of antibody proteins. The sheer numbers of B and T lymphocyte clones generated in a healthy individual guarantee that there will be at least one clone expressing a unique receptor sequence for every antigen encountered during the host\u2019s life span. As alluded to previously, these clones, with their array of antigen receptor specificities, are collectively called the individual\u2019s lymphocyte repertoire.Somatic recombination, the process that shuffles the DNA of the genes encoding BCRs in B cells and TCRs in T cells, is achieved by specialized genetic mechanisms that are described in Chapter 4 for B cells and Chapter 8 for T cells.\n",

This avoidance is called tolerance, the fifth aspect in which the adaptive response exhibits more refinement than the innate response. As stated previously, the specificity of each antigen receptor is randomly determined by somatic recombination during early lymphocyte development. By chance, some of the genetic sequences produced will encode receptors that recognize self molecules (self antigens). These lymphocytes must be identified as recognizing self and then either removed from the body entirely, or at least inactivated, to ensure that an individual has an effective lymphocyte repertoire that does not attack healthy tissue. Tolerance is established in two broad stages, each of which involves multiple mechanisms. The first stage, called central tolerance, occurs during early lymphocyte development. The mechanisms of central tolerance are designed to eliminate clones that recognize self antigens, thus establishing a lymphocyte repertoire that targets \u201cnon-self.\u201d In the second stage, called peripheral tolerance\n, any B and T lymphocytes that recognize self but somehow escaped the screening of central tolerance and completed their development are functionally silenced by another set of inactivating mechanisms.The establishment of central tolerance during lymphocyte development is described in Chapter 5 for B cells and in Chapter 9 for T cells.

An individual pathogen, such as a single influenza virus particle, is dealt with by these phases sequentially, but because the actual assault on the host involves billions of such particles, not every particle is in the same phase at the same time.

The components making up these barriers (skin, mucosae, gut enzymes) are non-inducible in that they pre-exist and do not develop or change in response to the presence of a foreign entity. Should these barriers be penetrated, the second, inducible phase of innate defense becomes effective 4\u201396 hours after the threat enters the body. Innate leukocytes activated by the binding of PRRs to PAMPs provided by the attacking pathogen, or to DAMPs present due to host cell injury or death, work quickly to eliminate the invader using the mechanisms of inflammation, phagocytosis and target cell lysis. Complement activation also contributes to clearance at this stage. In many cases, the incursion is completely controlled by the two phases of innate defense before adaptive immunity is even triggered. However, the cells of the innate response are ultimately limited both in numbers and in recognition capacity. Fortunately, even if the pathogen ultimately manages to thwart complete elimination by innate immunity, some of the invaders and/or their components or products will have been taken up by innate leukocytes and presented as foreign antigens to T lymphocytes. The third and final phase of host defense mediated by adaptive immunity is thus initiated. Th, Tc and B cells are clonally selected and activated, and then proliferate and differentiate into memory cells and large numbers of daughter effector cells that eliminate the pathogen via humoral and/or cell-mediated mechanisms. Because it takes time for the clonally selected lymphocytes to produce effector cells, adaptive responses are not usually observed until at least 96 hours after the start of infection.",

Innate and adaptive immunity do not operate in isolation, and each depends on or is enhanced by elements of the other (Fig. 1-8\n). The lymphocytes of the adaptive response require the involvement of cells and cytokines of the innate system to become activated and undergo differentiation into effector and memory lymphocytes. Conversely, activated lymphocytes secrete products that stimulate and improve the effectiveness of innate leukocytes. The interplay between innate and adaptive immunity is sustained by cytokine signaling and through direct intercellular contacts between innate and adaptive leukocytes. By cooperating in this way, innate and adaptive immunity combine to mount an optimal defense against pathogens.\nFocus on Relevant Research: \u201cThe Race between Infection and Immunity: How do Pathogens Set the Pace?\u201d by Davenport, M.P., Belz, G. T. and Ribeiro, R.M., (2009) Trends in Immunology 30, 61\u201366.Normal host homeostasis is re-established when the host wins (at least for that moment) the ongoing horse race between the host\u2019s immune system and a pathogen attempting to establish infection. Pathogens replicate at widely divergent rates, with some bacteria and viruses able to double their population size within a couple of hours. Fast-replicating pathogens therefore initially get ahead of the host\u2019s immune defenses, but then are caught and destroyed as the specialized cells of the immune system become activated. The mystery highlighted by the authors of this article is why slow-replicating pathogens are able to establish infections at all, and why so many of the most damaging chronic infections we experience, like those of the hepatitis B and C viruses and the bacteria causing tuberculosis, are caused by some of the slowest-replicating pathogens. The answer may lie in achieving certain threshold levels of infection that supply adequate amounts of the molecular triggers needed to spark first the innate response and then the adaptive response. If a pathogen replicates rapidly, large amounts of DAMPs and PAMPs are present that immediately activate innate leukocytes, including the APCs needed to initiate T cell responses. These T cells proliferate quickly enough to overwhelm the pathogen and eliminate it. In contrast, a slow-replicating pathogen may generate only low levels of DAMPs and PAMPs that do not activate large numbers of APCs, delaying the T cell response. Even once the T cell response is initiated, without sufficient cytokines produced by activated APCs, T cell proliferation may be slow and insufficient to completely eliminate the pathogen. The pathogen then survives to establish a low level of infection that doesn\u2019t kill the host but makes him/her miserable. The memory T cell response is of little help, as it only controls rather than eliminates the slow-replicating pathogen. An uneasy balance is set up between the pathogen and the host immune system that results in chronic infection. The contrast in immune response kinetics between what the authors call \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d pathogens is illustrated in Figure 1 from their article.\n\nThe pace of pathogen replication may have implications for vaccination strategies. Currently, vaccination often uses a harmless pathogen antigen to induce the host to respond and generate large populations of memory lymphocytes, which stand guard ready to mount a faster and stronger response should the real pathogen attack. For a fast-replicating pathogen, this tactic is successful because these types of pathogens readily generate enough PAMPs, DAMPs and antigen to surpass the thresholds of APC and T cell activation. With the \u201chead start\u201d provided by memory lymphocytes, the pathogen may not get to replicate at all. However, a slow-replicating pathogen may not provide sufficient antigen to reach even the lower threshold required by memory T cells, meaning that the vaccine will not have offered an advantage to the host. Worse, if the large numbers of memory T cells present after vaccination compete for the miserly quantities of antigen present, and so proliferate only slowly, the pathogen may in fact get a better foothold than if the host had NOT been vaccinated. These considerations should encourage us to experimentally test the threshold hypothesis and to refine our approach to vaccination accordingly.\n",

Firstly, the normal attack of a healthy immune system on a foreign tissue transplant meant to preserve life results in transplant rejection and deleterious consequences for the transplant patient. Secondly, when the tolerance of an individual\u2019s adaptive immune response fails, self tissues are attacked in a way that can lead to autoimmune disease. Thirdly, an immune response that is too strong or long can result in hypersensitivity to an entity. In this situation, the normal inflammation that accompanies the response gets out of control and causes significant collateral tissue damage. When an individual\u2019s normal adaptive immune system responds inappropriately to an antigen that is generally harmless, the immune response is manifested clinically as a form of hypersensitivity called allergy. Lastly, if normal regulation of the inflammatory response is lost for an extended period for any reason, chronic inflammation ensues that can set up conditions allowing the development of tumors, heart disease or autoimmune disorders.The pathological consequences of immune system irregularities include immunodeficiency (Ch. 15), cancer (Ch. 16 and 20Chapter 16Chapter 20), transplant rejection (Ch. 17), hypersensitivity (Ch. 18) and autoimmune disease (Ch. 19).\n",

In addition to their direct and broadly protective role, innate immune responses recruit adaptive leukocytes and contribute to their activation. Once activated, lymphocytes mount humoral and cell-mediated anti-pathogen responses that are highly specific. Cytokines are produced that further stimulate both the innate and adaptive responses. Innate and adaptive immunity thus work synergistically to protect the host from all threats.",

In a healthy individual, the immune system mounts an appropriate response that clears damaged cells and kills infectious organisms or cancerous cells. However, the immune system is a powerful and multi-faceted weapon that requires strict controls to remain in balance. When the immune system fails to respond adequately, or mounts an overzealous or inappropriate attack, or ignores normal control mechanisms, a wide variety of disease states can result.",
