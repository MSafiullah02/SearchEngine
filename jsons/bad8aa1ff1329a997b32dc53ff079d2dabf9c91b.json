Those of us, perhaps the less seasoned surgeons, who are not part of the higher-level protocol and policy development process, are searching for ways to contribute to the greater good of the COVID-19 response efforts. We propose a call to action for these surgeons to operate outside the box, without a blade, and assist in the role of palliative care physicians.",

Lastly, the SPCC will have their finger on the pulse of the ethical climate of the institution and provide updates to their group on the regional and national shifts in triaging practices and allocation of scarce resources as the crisis escalates.(4) ",
