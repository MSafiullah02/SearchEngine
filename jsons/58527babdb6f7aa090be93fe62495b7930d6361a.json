We conducted a survey of 1,048 people in five major cities in China to track and quantify the behavior changes in different periods since the outbreak. It is found that there was nearly 80% reduction of out-of-home activities (working, eating, shopping, taking public transportation, and travelling) during the peak period. Such activities are gradually increasing after the easing of containment measures but still significantly below pre-outbreak level. The significant behavior changes have contributed to the rapid control of virus transmission in China. While countries are reopening the economies before the virus disappears, the system and capacity of testing and contact tracing should be carefully designed with the tracking of people behavior changes in the future.",

It can be seen that the mask usage level was very high in both streets and crowded environment. The relatively low usage level in working place may be due to the shortage of masks in that period (21% of the respondents said that they once had no mask to wear at a certain time).",

Figure 3 shows the photos of out-of-home activities in different public places in China. It shows that there is still a relatively high level of awareness and compliance to the containment measures in the public, including wearing masks and temperature testing. Figure 4 summarizes the overall impacts of COVID-19 on different activities. During the peak period in early February, the overall out-of-home activity level was reduced to about 20% of the pre-outbreak level (average impacts of different activities). Since the reopening, the overall activity level gradually recovered to 67% of pre-outbreak level in late April. It is believed that the dramatic changes of people behavior contributed to the rapid containment of virus transmission in China.",

Working and shopping were least affected in the peak period (at 26% and 27% of pre-outbreak level) and recovered most rapidly after the peak (78% and 77% level). This may be due to the reason that working and shopping are essential to household living despite the risk of transmission. Travelling was also severely affected but recovered most slowly.
