            "text": "\nSolanum glaucophyllum (S. glaucophyllum) (synonym of Solanum malacoxylon) is a calcinogenic plant responsible for enzootic calcinosis in ruminants of South America, a cause of considerable economic losses in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay (Worker and Carrillo, 1967). The toxic principles, mainly contained in the leaves, consist of vitamin D analogues, mostly 1,25(OH)2D3, associated with glycoside derivatives. The chronic ingestion of this plant induces a hypervitaminosis D-like state (Wasserman, 1974, Dallorso et al., 2001, Mello, 2003). Spontaneous intoxication occurs in ruminants when the active principle is released into the rumen. The intoxication of non-ruminant species, such as pigs (Campero and Odriozola, 1990) and horses (Ruager and Gimeno, 1977), shows that the toxic principle does not need to suffer structural modifications such as the hydrolysis of the glycosides accounted in the rumen, as it has been previously suggested (Boland et al., 1986, Mello and Habermehl, 1992). Intoxicated animals show mineralization in heart, arteries, lungs and kidneys, join erosions, stiffness, painful gait, kyphosis, anorexia and loss of body condition. In severe cases, emaciation is also observed (Worker and Carrillo, 1967), although the cause remains unknown. Rabbits are useful as experimental model. They are highly susceptible to experimental treatment with S. glaucophyllum in a way similar to the natural intoxication that occurs in ruminants (Dallorso et al., 2001, Gimeno et al., 2004, Fontana and Zanuzzi, 2007, Zanuzzi et al., 2008, Zanuzzi et al., 2010).",

In contrast, in the rectum the changes in apoptosis seemed to play a primary role. In other experimental studies, variations in proliferation rate within intestinal regions have also been reported, e.g. in rats subjected to thermal stress (Greant et al., 1988) and in the colon of mice fed with a vitamin D-deficient diet (Sadava et al., 1996). Specific adaptive responses of each anatomical region and differences in the expression of vitamin D receptors within the gastrointestinal tract have been reported in goats, sheep (Liesegang et al., 2007, Riner et al., 2008) and rabbits (Duncan et al., 1984). Variations in the number and distribution of vitamin D receptors in the intestine might also explain the results obtained in the present study. In addition, the hormonal and metabolic profile of animals from group C during and after the treatment period, and the differences in the mechanism of adaptation or recovery of each intestinal section could account for their partial recovery.",

            "text": "Atrophy and changes in cell proliferation and death have been also reported in knockout mice for FGF-23 and Klotho genes that exhibit a hypervitaminosis-D like status (Razzaque and Lanske, 2006, Lanske and Razzaque, 2007). They show hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, atherosclerosis, emphysema, kyphosis, alopecia, loss of body weight, osteopenia/osteoporosis, hypogonadism, soft tissue calcifications and atrophy of several organs, such as thymus and spleen (Razzaque and Lanske, 2006, Medici et al., 2008). Most of the aforementioned clinical signs are frequently found in naturally and experimentally S. glaucophyllum-intoxicated animals. Particularly, in the intestine of FGF-23 and Klotho-knockout mice, intestinal mucosa and villi are atrophic (Razzaque and Lanske, 2006, Lanske and Razzaque, 2007). The reduced proliferation and the increased apoptosis explain those morphological alterations (Razzaque and Lanske, 2006, Lanske and Razzaque, 2007, Medici et al., 2008). The changes described in these knockout mice have been attributed to the hypervitaminosis D status, and considered premature ageing-like features (Razzaque and Lanske, 2006, Lanske and Razzaque, 2007, Medici et al., 2008). We also found significant differences in the proliferation index of the small intestine and in the apoptotic index of the ileum and rectum in the treated animals. In line with these observations, the similarity between the results of our model and those from transgenic mice further support the involvement of vitamin D in the changes found in the treated rabbits.",
