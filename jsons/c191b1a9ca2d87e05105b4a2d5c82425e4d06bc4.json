However, despite many efforts, it has been proven very difficult to find additional EM counterparts to the many LIGO/Virgo compact binary merger candidates since then. We explore the sensitivity of ongoing optical surveys searching for kNe and propose ways to optimize the choices of filters and survey depth to boost the detection efficiency for these faint and fast-evolving transients. In particular, we use kN models to explore the dependence on ejecta mass, geometry, viewing angle, wavelength coverage and source distance. Considering that the O3 LIGO/Virgo binary neutron star merger candidates were at distances about 5 times further than GW170817, we find that efficient gri counterpart search would require reaching a limiting magnitude m lim = 23 mag, given the model phase-space. We conclude that kN searches during O3 were generally too shallow to observe optical counterparts, even under optimistic assumptions, thus providing a plausible explanation for the lack of detections.",

Multiple independent detections associated with this event were made throughout the entire electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, including a short gamma-ray burst (Abbott et al. 2017b; Goldstein et al. 2017; Savchenko et al. 2017; Alexander et al. 2017; Haggard et al. 2017; Hallinan et al. 2017; Margutti et al. 2017; Coulter et al. 2017; Troja et al. 2017 ) and the kilonova (kN) AT2017gfo found at optical and IR wavelengths (Cowperthwaite et al. 2017; Kasliwal et al. 2017; Tanvir et al. 2017; Soares-Santos et al. 2017; Andreoni et al. 2017; Kasliwal et al. 2019) . A record number of studies were carried out on this single event, and many open questions remain with regards to the rates of neutron mergers, the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements, the mass range and equation of state of neutron stars, the diversity in the kN explosion population and their use as BNS mergers as distance yardsticks E-mail: ana.sagues-carracedo@fysik.su.se in cosmology. At only \u223c 40 Mpc distance, in the near-by galaxy NGC 4993, and close to face-on towards us (Hotokezaka et al. 2019) , GW170817/AT2017gfo was extremely favourable for detection.",

            "text": "On April 1st, 2019, LIGO/Virgo started the third observing run (O3) on the search of GWs. Since then, astronomers work closely with the LIGO and Virgo collaboration (LVC), who provide search maps with their public alerts used by the astronomy community to carry out target of opportunity (ToO) follow-up programs. One year later, by March 27 2020, the O3 run was prematurely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of 14 merger alerts been issued by the LVC including at least one neutron star, i.e., either BNS or neutron star -black hole (NS-BH), no kN was securely identified. In this work we explore possible explanations for the lack of optical counterparts, in spite of rapid responses by the optical astronomy community to the LVC alerts. We quantify the kN detection probability for the typical specifications of the follow-up surveys adopted, and suggest potential improvements. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of serendipitous kN detection, independently of LVC triggers.",

The searches were performed trying to optimize coverage of the candidate skymap provided by the LVC. Unfortunately, no identification of a kN was made, nor any other EM detection that could be securely associated to the GW signal. In this section, we explore the detection probability for kNe at the distances reported in the LVC alerts, with the purpose to explore possible explanations for the non-detections. Since the modelled grid are tailored to BNS mergers (Section 2), we will focus on the six BNS triggers listed in Table 1 . The efficiency for detection of NS-BH counterparts have to be treated separately, as their lightcurves are predicted to be brighter and longer lasting compared to those from BNS mergers (Rosswog et al. 2017; Barbieri et al. 2019; Kawaguchi et al. 2020) .

The day after, a new alert for a possible BNS was sent (S190426c), with a better localization (1131 deg 2 ) but more than twice further away (377 \u00b1 100 Mpc). These first two candidates were followed-up within the GROWTH collaboration (Coughlin et al. 2019 ,Goldstein et al. 2019 , probing the fast response to the low latency skymap and coverage capacity. No alerts with BNS candidates were released in the following few months until the beginning of September with S190901ap and S190910h. The skymap for both of these events was poorly localized,14753 deg 2 and 24264 deg 2 , and the luminosity distances inferred to be 241 \u00b1 79 Mpc and 233 \u00b1 88 Mpc, respectively. These were the last events detected before the break in October and the end of O3a. During O3b, two non-retracted BNS candidates were sent, S191213g and S200213t, both at a mean distance of 201 Mpc (\u00b1 81 and 80 Mpc, respectively). The closest BNS candidate in O3, at 156 Mpc, is four times more distant than GW170817 (40 Mpc), and the rest of the events happened more than five times further away. Another remarkable factor is the poor localization comparing with GW170817, 28 deg 2 90% confident area (Abbott et al. 2017a) . We seek to understand which is the limiting magnitude required to detect a kN. We study the detectability at different luminosity distances. We focus on the results at 200 Mpc as a representative distance for the BNS candidates in O3.",

We also indicate the estimated mean distances from the GW signals of the six BNS trigger by LIGO/Virgo during O3. The shape of the 90% probability contours shows the dependency with the viewing angle for the fiducial model, the probability drops significantly towards equatorial viewing angles in which the photons are heavily absorbed by the lanthanides. As can be appreciated, unlike GW170817, none of the much more distant six LVC BNS events during O3 had a sizeable probability of detection at a limiting magnitude of 21 mag, which was very typical for the O3 follow-up campaigns. For 22 mag, only favourable viewing angles can be probed, whereas surveys reaching 23 mag would have had a good chance to detect a counterpart. We also find that redder wavelength coverage, like i-band reaching the same limiting magnitude, significantly increases the volume in which a kN is likely observable. Table 1 , shows the minimum limiting magnitude at which the integrated detection probability over all viewing angles is more than 90% at distance of the BNS merger candidates from LVC in O3 assuming the fiducial model.",

            "text": "In addition to the intrinsic observational challenges posed by the rapid evolution of kN lightcurves, the distances to the BNS triggers during the third run of LIGO and Virgo have been around 200 Mpc, about five times larger than for GW170817. Some of the events were detected with a single interferometer, which translates into poor localization. Large search areas, in combination with long distances, poses great challenges for the detection of EM counterparts. Survey scheduling under such conditions is even harder, considering the lack of knowledge of the underlying kN population. During O3, the effort to cover these large search areas on the sky was remarkable (Gompertz et al. 2020; Antier et al. 2020b; Andreoni et al. 2020; Ackley et al. 2020; Vieira et al. 2020; Watson et al. 2020; Gompertz et al. 2020; Goldstein et al. 2019 ), but the adopted depth was generally insufficient to identify the counterpart, according to the models we have studied. Several collaborations such as DECam-GROWTH 2 (Anand et al. 2020) , ENGRAVE (Ackley et al. 2020) or GRANDMA (Antier et al. 2020a,b) had triggered ToO observations with a global multi-telescope network when it was feasible. It has been shown that current capabilities can afford to cover large areas on the sky, but the reached depth was insufficient to detect the EM.",

The asymmetry of the kN emission and the higher likelihood of viewing angles close to the merger plane means that most of the kNe are going to be produced under conditions much less favourable for detection than GW170817.",

At a distance of 200 Mpc, the required magnitude to observe a kN similar to AT2017gfo at lanthanide-rich viewing angles with three days lasting lightcurve is at least 23 mag. For an AT2017gfo-like event at that distance, pointing towards us with a viewing angle within the lanthanide-free component, m lim = 22 mag could be sufficient.

The blue emission fades rapidly, and it suffers more from absorption at viewing angles close to the merger plane, where the dynamical ejecta leaves most of the lanthanides. Thus, observations in red filters tend to be much more efficient. In this work we show that adding i-band observations in an optical survey yields, on average, more than two times more detections than e.g., observing with only g-and r-band. ing luminosities, continued deep observations over multiple days is required, something that is hard to achieve with current instruments due to unpredictable weather patterns and moon phase among other factors. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO/LSST) with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST, LSST Science Collaboration et al. 2009) with its 8-meter-class telescope, planned to be online by 2023, will discover transients that are too far or too faint for the current available surveys, including serendipitous discoveries of kNe (Setzer et al. 2019) .",

The survey magnitude depths during follow-up campaigns in O3 have been generally insufficient, considering the asymmetry of the kN emission, the sometimes poor localization and distances, typically 5 times further than GW170817. Despite the lack of kN detections during O3, the multimessenger astronomy community have demonstrated a remarkable ability to respond promptly to LVC alerts, even those with wide search areas. Thus, the future is promising, also as more detectors join the gravitational waves observatory network, leading to better localization. Thus, we expect that with improved search strategies described here, future campaigns will be successful. ",

Observations with gr (green) and gri (red) for viewing angles in the lanthanide-rich (bottom) and the lanthanide-free (top) components are shown. The normalized distribution of post-merger epoch does not change significantly for different limiting magnitudes, while the distribution on detection in distance and viewing-angle space will be shifted. We show results for m lim = 22 mag as a representative example. t merger (days) gri m lim = 22 gr m lim = 22 gri m lim = 20.5 gr m lim = 20.Range from the minimum to the maximum last detection (in units of days) from the detected lightcurves as a function of distance, observing with gr and gri at different limiting magnitudes for the fiducial model.lightcurves fade very quickly and, in some cases, would not even provide any detection. However, observations in bluer bands may play important roles in candidate vetting and characterization of kN events. Detection of the very fast decay in bluer bands, besides the longer lasting redder wavelengths is an excellent feature for the identification.",
