The first-instar larva of one species of the endemic genus Palaestra Laporte de Castelnau, 1840, is described as well as those of other phoretic species without adult association and consequently unplaced to genus. Two main larval types (Groups 1 and 2) are recognised, as are distinct morphotypes within each group. Although both groups are assignable to the Nemognathinae, they are characterised by traits not paralleled by subfamily representatives from other regions of the world. Group 1, which includes Palaestra, is the more distinctive, whereas Group 2 shares most characteristics with members of the cosmopolitan tribe Nemognathini. A tabular comparison of larval groups and morphotypes is included.",

All Nemognathinae triungulins are phoretic with the possible exception of the relatively plesiomorphic genus Stenodera Eschscholtz, 1818 (Bologna et al. 2002) , and consequently their morphology is less heterogeneous than in the nominate subfamily (e.g. Di Giulio & Bologna 2007) . Triungulins of Australian blister beetles have never been described specifically. Silvestri (1920) cited, and superficially figured and described a phoretic triungulin collected near Adelaide on a Zygentoma of the family Nicoletiidae (Subtrinemura excelsa (Silvestri 1920) ). A biological association of blister beetles with silverfishes is unknown and this record could have been accidental. We failed to locate this triungulin in the Silvestri collection at the Portici University (Napoli). More recently Houston (1984 Houston ( , 1987 reported triungulins phoretic on Australian Stenotritidae bees. These larvae, incorporated by in their phylogenetic study of Meloidae (as sp. H), are described here together with other larvae of Nemognathini collected in the field, and of Palaestra rufipennis (Westwood, 1841) obtained recently from eggs. Larvae from one of these field collections also were incorporated in the 2001 phylogenetic study (as sp. K).",

The first (Group 1), characterised by ple-siomorphic traits, includes two morphotypes: morphotype A (with the genus Palaestra and species A1) and morphotype B, with a single species (B1). It is likely that one or more genera in addition to Palaestra are included. The second assemblage (Group 2), characterised by more derived features, includes two distinct morphotypes, C apparently with four species, and D with three. Morphological differences suggest that at least two taxa are represented. The prominent tooth-like transverse ridges of the mandibles and two pairs of ocelli clearly assign Group 1 larvae to the Nemognathinae as characterised by MacSwain (1956) . However, assignment to the tribe Nemognathini remains tentative. These larvae differ from all known Nemognathini in lacking modified spiracles on abdominal segment VIII and from most in having hair-like caudal setae (Fig. 3a) . Both features are believed to be primitive for the subfamily. Other primitive traits, the presence of a well-developed epicranial suture and a line of dehiscence on the pronotum (Fig. 1a,b) , also occur in several genera in the subfamily. Group 1 larvae share these traits with the Horiini, considered a subfamily by MacSwain (1956) and only a tribe in the more recent literature, but they lack toothed tarsal claws, the only clearly derived larval feature of horiines. placed clade L, which included two of the group species studied here (A1, B1), in the Nemognathini based on the presence of a dense tuft of setae on the epipharynx (char. 20), a feature absent in the Horiini. However, the monophyly of Group 1 is inadequately supported. The only character believed to be derived is the dorsal position of abdominal spiracle I. This condition, known to occur in several genera of Meloinae, has not been reported in other nemognathines. Other features supporting monophyly of clade L (which would now also include Palaestra) in either are reversals (chars. 17, 46, 49) or now are known in other nemognathine genera (char. 85). The study of adult traits and additional larvae should assist in the taxonomic positioning of this assemblage. What is clear is that the larvae of Group 1 species are thus far unique to Australia.",

Within the tribe, Group 2 appears to be most similar to genera which MacSwain placed in the Zonitides (Zonitis, Gnathium Kirby, 1818 , Leptopalpus Gu\u00e9rin-M\u00e9neville, 1834 , and Pseudozonitis Dillon, 1950 , and Bologna and Pinto in clade K. In this assemblage, as in all Group 2 representatives, the epicranial suture is absent as is the line of dehiscence on the pronotum (Fig. 1c,d) . The number of tooth-like transverse ridges on the mandibles also is reduced (<5) (Fig. 4c,d) . The distinct caudal setae of species of Group 2 (Figs 1d,5) however separates it from larvae thus far described in these other genera (Fig. 3b) . This character may represent a primitive condition in these Australian Nemognathini of clade K that also occurs in some Palaearctic genera such as Sitaris Latreille, 1802 and Apalus Fabricius, 1775.",

Ongoing studies of adults (A Bologna, JD F Turco unpubl. data 2007-2010) document the presence in Australia also of Synhoria Kolbe, 1897 (Horiini) and Zonitoschema P\u00e9ringuey, 1909 (Nemognathini) . They show clearly that many of these species (Z. purpureipennis, Z. violacea Hope, 1842, Z. violaceipennis Waterhouse, 1875, and many others) are placed inappropriately in Zonitis and instead are allied more closely to Palaestra. Morphotypes A and B (Group 1) probably represent this lineage which is known currently only from Australia, New Guinea, Micronesia, Sri Lanka and East Africa. Morphotypes C and D (Group 2) are more cosmopolitan, with basic features characterising Nemognathini from other parts of the world. They are probably assignable to Zonitis and/or Zonitoschema or possibly to undescribed genera.",
