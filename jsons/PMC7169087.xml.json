The annual global cost is unknown, but in the USA the direct cost of community and nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections was estimated at US$15 billion in 1985.\n2\n By 2001 the economic burden of non\u2010influenza viral respiratory tract infection alone had increased to US$40 billion in the USA.\n3\n Including direct and indirect costs (such as loss of work time), the cost of influenza alone in the USA is currently estimated at US$87 billion per year,\n4\n although total indirect costs have been estimated by others at over US$100 billion annually.\n5\n Clearly, the global cost of respiratory infection must be in the trillions (US$) per year.",

While some pathogens are dependant on human\u2010to\u2010human spread, there are numerous examples of pathogens that normally invade their host directly from an environment source. Typical examples include Legionella spp., non\u2010tuberculous mycobacteria and a plethora of fungi and molds, including Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Aspergillus and Coccidiomycosis, just to name a few. While our immune systems have adapted in response to environmental threats, these pathogens will always remain a threat, particularly in subjects whose immune response becomes compromised by age or disease.",

During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, extensive public health campaigns aimed at reducing spread of respiratory droplets by good cough hygiene, the avoidance of work, school or day care during acute infections, and a massive uptake in mask wearing in the general populace had a dramatic effect on the rates of all viral respiratory infections in Hong Kong.\n6\n As relaxing these efforts led to a return to normal rates of viral transmission, much more can clearly be done to reduce community spread of pulmonary pathogens, especially during pan/epidemics.",
