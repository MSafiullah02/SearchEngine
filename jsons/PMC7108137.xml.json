Outpatient care at SCCA comprises 1 large ambulatory clinic and 2 off-site satellite clinics. Electronic medical record data including patient demographics, clinical data, antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions, and viral diagnostic testing were obtained. Chart review was conducted to verify the URI diagnosis code and identify the index date of the first clinical encounter for the URI (day 0). Patients without documented active URI symptoms or with evidence of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) on day 0 were excluded. For patients with more than 1 URI during the study period, the first episode was selected for analysis. We captured the provider responsible for decision making at day 0 and the patient-reported URI symptom start date, and we classified antibiotic prescriptions in days 0\u201314 as URI-related or non\u2013URI-related. Steroid use, other immunosuppressive medications, and chemotherapy were recorded. Clinical outcomes in days 0\u201314 were collected, including healthcare visits, hospitalizations, and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of LRTI. The Fred Hutch Institutional Review Board approved the study.",

Poisson generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models were used to test associations between baseline factors and risk of any antibiotic prescribing for the URI in days 0\u201314. The Poisson model was chosen to provide relative risk (RR) model estimates [25], and GEE was used to account for correlation among patients seen by the same provider. Candidate explanatory variables were chosen a priori based on factors previously identified as important in antibiotic prescribing for URIs in general populations [8, 12] and factors specific to our cancer population. We limited candidate variables to ensure a minimum of approximately 10 events per covariate. These variables included viral testing performed on day 0, clinical service, peak flu season, patient age, symptoms at presentation, comorbidities, steroids or other immunosuppressive medications in the 2 weeks before day 0, and chemotherapy in the 30 days before day 0. Symptoms at presentation were defined using the following mutually exclusive categories: fever, no fever with either sputum production or chest congestion, and any other respiratory viral symptom in the absence of fever, sputum production, and chest congestion. We first ran univariable models, then constructed parsimonious multivariable models using the purposeful variable selection approach (Supplementary Methods) [26]. Because viral testing and clinical service were highly related, we considered these variables in separate models.",

Few studies have evaluated the effect of respiratory viral molecular diagnostic tests on antibiotic prescribing in an outpatient setting. A recent large study of outpatients with acute respiratory infections found that patients with a clinical diagnosis code of influenza had a decreased odds of receiving an antibiotic prescription [12]. However, in that study, only about one-quarter of patients who had research laboratory\u2013confirmed influenza received a clinical diagnosis code for influenza. Antibiotics were prescribed in 29% of patients who had research laboratory\u2013confirmed influenza, suggesting that improved access to rapid molecular diagnostics may be helpful in reducing antibiotic prescribing. An open-label, randomized, controlled trial found that access to multiplex respiratory viral PCR reduced antibiotic prescribing at the initial outpatient visit, although this effect was not sustained at the follow-up visit 8 to 12 days later [17]. A retrospective study of patients from a Veterans Administration medical center found fewer antibiotic prescriptions among patients who tested positive for influenza by on-demand Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel, but no difference in antibiotic prescribing between patients with a noninfluenza respiratory virus and patients with no respiratory virus detected [16].",

The small sample size may have limited our ability to detect a difference by test result. As others have described, it is possible that access to viral testing in and of itself along with the prospect of achieving a diagnosis could have influenced prescribing behavior [17]. Viral testing may also fulfill providers\u2019 desire to meet perceived patient expectations of an intervention for the management of their URI. The turnaround time (TAT) for test results was about 24 hours; it is unknown whether more rapid TAT, which is available with point-of-care tests, could impact prescribing. Finally, some providers may have prescribed antibiotics despite a positive respiratory virus test due to concern for bacterial coinfection among these vulnerable patient populations.",

Interestingly, antibiotic prescribing was lowest among BMT patients who are often considered among the highest risk; however, these patients are seen in the clinic more frequently than other hematology\u2013oncology patients, and providers may have felt more comfortable deferring antibiotics due to closer follow-up. The highest rates of antibiotic prescribing were observed at our satellite clinics, which manage a mix of patients with solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. These clinics as well as several high-volume prescribers that we identified present an opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship program outreach and consideration of strategies previously described, including peer comparison [27]. We did not examine specific provider factors beyond clinical service. However, previous studies have found that physician specialty, age or level of career, gender, patient volume, and country of training were associated with antibiotic prescribing for URIs [8, 9, 11, 28].",

First, our results may not be generalizable to other hematology\u2013oncology settings where outpatient viral diagnostic testing may not be readily available and the variation in physician culture across clinical services may differ. The high correlation we observed between clinical service and viral diagnostic testing limited our ability to separate these effects on antibiotic prescribing and may also be unique to our institution. Because most viral testing occurred within the BMT or hematology service, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the role of viral testing and antibiotic prescribing among solid tumor patients. Second, the modest sample size limited our ability to evaluate additional factors for associations with antibiotic prescribing. However, the smaller sample size enabled us to address the limitations of billing data by performing a detailed chart review to verify the ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Notably, nearly 20% of patients with ICD-10 codes consistent with URI had no chart documentation of URI symptoms. Larger studies that rely on diagnosis codes from billing data may be unable to account for these discrepancies. Finally, we did not formally review each antibiotic prescription for the URI to assess appropriateness. However, we chose diagnosis codes that correspond to conditions for which antibiotics would generally be considered inappropriate, which is consistent with the approach taken in other studies [3, 7\u201313]. In addition, we reviewed diagnoses of sinusitis and found that appropriate use [6, 29] in these cases contributed minimally to total antibiotic use in the cohort.",
