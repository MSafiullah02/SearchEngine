There was vacuolar alteration along the basal layer of the epidermis, with scattered singly necrotic (apoptotic) keratinocytes, which were occasionally present in the superficial layers of the epidermis (Fig 2\n). The basement membrane zone was smudged, and there was papillary dermal fibrin confined near the ulcer edge. There was no pallor (edema) of the papillary dermis. The infiltrate was dense and lichenoid in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis, and the deeper dermis had a tightly cuffed perivascular and perieccrine distribution (Fig 3\n). Some nuclear debris was present, but no neutrophils were identified. The venules surrounded by the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate had plump endothelial cells. No intraluminal fibrin thrombi were identified, and no fibrin was identified within venule walls. Direct immunofluorescence result was negative. In accordance with these features, a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection\u2013induced chilblains was made.",

To our knowledge, it had not been previously reported because of the limited availability of PCR testing for COVID-19. Young patients presenting with chilblains have lacked criteria sufficient to allow for a COVID-19 PCR test. Because of the recent outbreak of chilblains, concurrent with the increase of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 has been widely suspected as the etiology. We have further suspected an association because chilblains have been appearing during the warmer springtime rather than the usual cold winter period. Similar to this case, other young patients presenting with chilblains have also lacked a history of chilblains, Raynaud phenomenon, or collagen vascular diseases such as lupus erythematosus. These cases have all been in children and young adults whose feet have been more affected than their hands. Chilblains may be the inaugural symptom of COVID-19, and a fever and dry cough may be minimal or even absent. These patients appear to have an indolent course, often not knowing that they have a COVID-19 infection and that they are likely contagious. Acute acral cyanosis in the absence of chilblains has also been observed (unpublished data).",

Among these syndromes, the most representative are the overlap between Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome and familial chilblain lupus and the stimulator of IFN gene-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy.5\n,\n6 The aforementioned interferonopathies share both a clinical and biological overlap with lupus erythematosus.",

The IFN-I response, however, induces microangiopathic changes, producing a chilblain lupus erythematosus\u2013like eruption. Older patients, unfortunately, may have an inadequate or delayed IFN-I response, exacerbating preexisting hypercytokinemia, with subsequent increased morbidity and mortality. Chilblain lupus erythematosus\u2013like lesions in young people should not be confused with the acral ischemia caused by thrombosis that is being observed in severely ill COVID-19 patients. These patients, usually in the intensive care unit, have hypercoagulopathy and elevated D-dimer levels.9 Thus, the IFN-I response in young patients may be advantageous, whereas the delayed or insufficient IFN-I response in older patients may be disadvantageous. In short, COVID-19 infection\u2013induced chilblains may portend an indolent course and a good prognosis (Fig 4\n).",
