In order to address this pressing issue, we introduce the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT), a suite of tools aimed to encapsulate the cumbersome details of acquiring, preprocessing, annotating and standardizing social media data. The purpose of our toolkit is for researchers to focus on answering research questions, and not the technical aspects of using social media data. By using a standard toolkit, researchers will be able to acquire, use, and release data in a consistent way that is transparent for everybody using the toolkit, hence, simplifying research reproducibility and accessibility in the social media domain.",

We originally wanted to use other researcher's tools and surprisingly we found very little code available with the majority outdated and non-functioning. Going one step back, we did find rudimentary Python libraries to interact with the Twitter API, but some of their learning curves are steep and not overly documented. We then decided to clean and integrate our code into a toolkit that would help us provide a comprehensive resource for other researchers/users to replicate our work and to use in their own analyses, hence SMMT was born. Parallel to tools like SMMT, there are other research groups that are outlining frameworks to streamline the mining of social media like Sarker et. al. [12] , which are complementary to the use and need of this tool.",

Besides extensive usage documentation, the tool also provides two end-toend usage examples, as well as additional Google Colaboratory [14] interactive Python notebooks with data usage examples. Note than in order to use most of the functionality of SMMT, users need to sign-up to acquire access to the Twitter Application Program Interface API.

All details and steps of this process are outlined in the Colab Notebook. Application Note 4) We then test our trained model on the test set and generate a confusion matrix heat-map (Figure 3) of the classification task, and show the model performance metrics.",
