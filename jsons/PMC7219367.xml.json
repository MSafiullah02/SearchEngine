In preparation for increased numbers of patients with severe respiratory compromise, many hospitals have intentionally reduced non-emergent procedures and hospitalizations to preserve hospital capacity and personal protective equipment. In some places, state directives mandate this. These plans and directives should not influence admissions from the emergency department for acute cardiovascular conditions, including heart failure (HF).",

We also compared trends in HF hospitalizations from 2019 during the same time period to account for the potential for residual confounding based on seasonal trends in HF hospitalizations. All HF subtypes including HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) subtypes were included in this analysis.",

In the two weeks prior to the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in Mississippi, HF cases averaged 30 per week. After the first diagnosed case in Mississippi, mean HF hospitalizations declined by 50% to 15 per week. HF hospitalizations continued to decline to lower levels after a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d was declared and even further after the statewide \u201cshelter in place\u201d was mandated, with fewer HF hospitalizations in the last two weeks of this analysis. Although we observed week-to-week variability in HF hospitalizations in 2019, we did not observe significant and progressive declines similar to those noted during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Before the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the state of Mississippi, 68.1% of HF cases were HFrEF subtype, 22.4% HFpEF and 9.5% HFmrEF. We observed a very similar distribution of HF subtypes after March 12 including 65.9% HFrEF, 26.8% HFpEF and 7.3% HFmrEF.",

With rare exceptions, most HF hospitalizations are non-elective and represent worsening congestion that can have significant impact on patient outcomes if not treated or delayed. Theoretically, these hospitalizations are not expected to be affected by hospital or health authority policies. This is particularly true for large, tertiary care referral centers that offer advanced therapies. On the other hand, such centers are likely to also take care of many of the sickest COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is possible that patients with non-COVID-19 related illnesses may be concerned about the potential for their own risk for nosocomial infection when in the hospital getting treatment for other urgent medical conditions such as HF. Importantly, there was no announcement at either the health system or state health department levels to divert patients with certain medical conditions to specific hospitals. To this point, there were similar numbers of transfers for HF to our institution before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (mean 4.0 \u00b1 2.8 vs 3.0 \u00b1 1.8 transfers per week, respectively).",
