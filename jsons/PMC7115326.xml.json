HCP categories included medical students, nurses (intensive care unit and general patient care), physicians, and residents. Pertinent histories, including recent upper respiratory symptoms and antibiotic use, were obtained. All 200 HCPs were asymptomatic for a minimum of 4 weeks before samples were taken. Each HCP completed a questionnaire that evaluated their respiratory status. Questionnaires were reviewed by physicians at Huntsville Hospital, and it was determined that none of the subjects likely had current infections during specimen collection intervals. None of the physicians who participated in the study reviewed the surveys. Eligibility criteria required HCPs be free of respiratory symptoms for at least 4 weeks prior to specimen collection and agree to provide a nasopharyngeal specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected in 2014 during January-February and June-July, representing the winter and summer observations, respectively. Specimens were sent via courier to Diatherix Laboratories.

The presence of M catarrhalis was unexpected because colonization usually only occurs in children, and only 3% of healthy adults are colonized.8 The high winter detection frequency of M catarrhalis observed could be a result of the temperature-dependent characteristics of the organism. At lower temperatures, the speed of transcription and abundance of mRNA transcripts increases, M catarrhalis grows and divides at a more rapid rate, and the organism's pathogenic behavior has a higher probability of being activated.9, 10\nM catarrhalis can live commensally for extended periods; therefore, the incubation time of this organism is not well defined. However, M catarrhalis can become pathogenic in subjects with compromised immune systems or in subjects that have experienced nasopharyngeal stress, such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.11 As a result, it may be valuable to determine which HCPs are colonized with M catarrhalis and determine whether there is a correlation with infection rates in at-risk patients.12\n",

As a result, many hospitals implement S aureus and MRSA infection reduction protocols and use active surveillance programs to decolonize patients before admission or surgery.14\nS aureus and MRSA also attack the lower respiratory tract where organisms are often parasitic and cause bacterial pneumonia.15 In this study, 4 HCPs in the winter and 1 HCP in the summer were colonized by PVL-positive MRSA. PVL is a potent cytotoxin produced by S aureus that causes necrotizing pneumonia with a high mortality rate.16 Many hospitals have already implemented decolonization procedures for patients colonized with S aureus and MRSA, but future studies could support the decolonization of asymptomatic HCPs.",

Summer detection was anticipated because the prevalence of K pneumoniae infections, especially bloodstream infections, increases during the summer.17, 18 The seasonal variation in K pneumoniae colonization is not well understood. It has been reported that higher rates of K pneumoniae colonization are primarily related to the use of antibiotics. Here, only 1 (14.3%) of the 7 HCPs that were colonized with K pneumoniae recently received antibiotics.19\nK pneumoniae can be easily and rapidly transmitted to immunocompromised patients from the hands of contaminated HCPs.5 Similar to PVL-positive S aureus and MRSA, K pneumoniae can also infect to the lower respiratory tract causing abnormalities such as bulging interlobar fissures, cavitary abscesses, and necrotizing pneumonia.20, 21 As a result, detecting and decolonizing the carriers of K pneumoniae could have a positive impact on reducing high-risk transmission and hospital-acquired infections during the summer, particularly in patients with comorbidities.",

Five different viruses, including adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus-echovirus, and pandemic influenza A H1N1-09, were detected at least once in either or both seasons. There are few studies that investigate the effects of viral colonization or coinfections in the upper respiratory tract. Previous reports show that the prevalence of viral pathogens may increase bacterial colonization and risk of infection in the nasopharynx.22 In addition, 1 study proposed a colonization-competition model for RNA viruses and predicted that low-virulence strains initially colonize human cells and then competitive, high-virulence strains prime the nasopharynx for infection.23 Multiplex polymerase chain reaction technology can help add to these models and better define the unknown mechanisms of colonization and infection of viral pathogens.",

Presumably, many of the HCPs in this study had respiratory diseases long before this study and could be conveying nucleic acid remnants that were detected by TEM-PCR. The 4-week clearance period (as previously described in the Methods section) was intended to reduce the likelihood of this possible false detection; however, the half-life of nucleic acid fragments in this setting is not known. It is almost certain that RNA remnants degrade more quickly than DNA.24 In the winter, a larger proportion of HCPs had prior respiratory symptoms, which may have been responsible for the higher frequency of pathogens detected in this season. Further testing methods, such as culture, would need to be conducted to discriminate between nucleic acid remnants and viable microorganisms. It is also possible that the high sensitivity of multiplex polymerase chain reaction detected recent invader cells that would later cause disease in the HCP. However, for the purposes of this study, we do not discriminate between long-standing colonies and recent invader cells because both scenarios can plausibly spread pathogens to at-risk patients.",

A larger proportion of nurses tested during both seasons worked in the intensive care unit (26 [78.8%] in the winter, 29 [61.7%] in the summer), which could have been the reason for moderately high pathogen detection frequency in this subset. Information was unavailable to determine the proportion of time each HCP treated patients while wearing a mask. Not wearing masks would increase the likelihood of transmission from patient to HCP and vice versa. Even though this study focuses on HCP colonization, the identification and management of all possible pathogen reservoirs, such as health care surfaces, equipment, and colonized visitors, are also important for preventing the spread of infection in a clinical setting.5\n",

Colonization of viral pathogens needs substantially greater understanding, and defining the unknown colonization and infection potential of these upper respiratory organisms is important. This preliminary observational study explores the prevalence of colonization of various pathogens at 2 different points in the year, and if validated with larger follow-up studies, this information could be ultimately relevant in the clinic. Determining correlations between levels of HCP colonization and at-risk patient infection rates could assist in defining novel transmission pathways. In turn, hospital protocols could be altered so that colonized HCPs and at-risk patient interactions could be managed, threat of transmission could be minimized, and infection control protocols could be optimized.",
