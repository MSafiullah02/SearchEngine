Anti-Id are classified into three major categories: Ab2,, Ab2, and Ab2.,. The Ab2, and Ab2, recognize framework idiotopes either near or distant from the paratope of the Abl, respectively, whereas Ab2,, also called internal image anti-Id, recognize paratope-associated idiotopes. By their potential to molecularly mimic the Ag, Ab2, have been shown to induce neutralizing Ab, protective Ab, or both against various infectious agents [l-31 and to activate T lymphocyte [4] . A true internal image would not be genetically restricted in its ability to induce an immune response, and would be efficient across species barriers [5, 61.

To examine whether the vaccinating property of these Ab2 was genetically controlled, mice of eight different inbred strains were immunized with Ab2 or control normal rabbit immunoglobulins (NRIg) and challenged intracerebrally with ten LD50 of MHV-A59. The LD50 values ranged between 1.75 x lo4 and 8 x lo4 PFU, except for B6 and SWR strains, where it was around 6 x lo3, and B10.D2 and BIO.G mice where it was 1 x 10'-1.3 x 10' (data not shown). In agreement with our previous observations [20] , about 75% of AbZimmunized BALBk (H-2d) mice survived over 60 days after virus challenge (Fig. 1) . However, marked variations in the survival rates were detected from one mouse strain to another. An almost complete protection was obtained in SWR and DBA/l (H-27 mice, whereas only 25-30% of immunized DBA/2 (H-2d) and CBA (H-2k) mice survived virus challenge. However, the protection observed in CBA mice was not statistically significant. Moreover, Ab2 had no vaccinating capacity in B6 and B10 (H-2') mice, and an apparent reduced survival was even seen in C3H (H-2k) mice in comparison with control NRIg-treated mice. Thus, AbZmediated rotection was seen in H-2q and H-2d mice, but not in H-2 and H-2' mice. These results indicate that the efficacy of Ab2 treatment is genetically controlled and suggest that it may be H-2dependent. haplotypes in mice of the B10 background may reverse their resistance to Ab2-induced protection against MHV-A59 infection. Results of these experiments are reported in Fig. 2 . As expected, reduction in survival was observed in AbZimmunized BALB/c congenic mice expressing the H-2b or H-2k haplotype. However, the introduction of H-2q or H-2d haplotype in mice of B10 background was not sufficient to override the failure of Ab2 treatment to protect B10 mice from virus challenge (Fig. 2) . These results suggest that the capacity of Ab2 to protect mice against MHV-A59 infection is mainly dependent on genetic elements located outside the MHC complex. However, given an appropriate genetic background, the amplitude of the Ab2-induced antiviral response would probably be regulated by H-2 or H-2-linked gene(s). This conclusion is supported by the observed variations in survival in MHCcongenic mice on the BALB/c background. It remains to be elucidated whether a unique background gene shared by BALB/c, DBA/l, DBA/2, and SWR mice is responsible for the capacity of these mice to respond to Ab2 anti-7-10A. This is, however, unlikely since mice of these four strains were not protected to the same level following Ab2 vaccination. Further experiments are needed before the genes involved are identified. Testing the AbZmediated anti-coronavirus protection in CXB recombinant inbred mice may help to characterize the BALB/c-associated gene.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 745, "end": 753, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1667, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1981, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Immunization of mice of different strains with Ab2"}, {"text": "To evaluate whether variations in AbZmediated protection of mice belonging to diffeent strains correlated with the presence of antiviral antibodies (Ab3), the sera of immunized mice were tested by ELISA and virus neutralization assays for the presence of MHV-A59-specific Ab3. The results presented in Table 1 indicate that mice of any strain in which protection was observed after Ab2 treatment developed significant levels of MHV-A59-reactive and neutralizing Ab3. This suggests an overall link between AbZinduced antiviral Ab3 and the observed protection of mice from viral challenge. This was confirmed by the Cox's proportional hazards statistical model, where the high serological ELISA response of each mouse was defined as a response higher than the median serological scores specific for responding mice of a given strain. For Ab2-protected mouse strains, the. reduction in mortality correlated with a high serological response.

The relative contribution of the different components of the immune network in AbZinduced vaccination is not yet fully elucidated. It should also be kept in mind that, under certain circumstances, immunization with anti-Id may even be deleterious. Indeed, a significant increase in mortality, rather than protection, was observed in one of the mouse strains (C3H) used in this study. Similarly, Kennedy et al. [24] reported an increase in the pathogenicity of herpes simplex virus following immunization of BALB/c mice with a polyclonal Ab2.
