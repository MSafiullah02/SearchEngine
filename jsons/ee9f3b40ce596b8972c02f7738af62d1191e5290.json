Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) expression is an important susceptibility factor for HuNoV infection based on controlled human infection models and epidemiologic studies that show an association of secretor status with infection caused by several genotypes. The fucosyltransferase 2 gene (FUT2) affects HBGA expression in intestinal epithelial cells; secretors express a functional FUT2 enzyme, while nonsecretors lack this enzyme and are highly resistant to infection and gastroenteritis caused by many HuNoV strains. These epidemiologic associations are confirmed by infections in stem cell-derived human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures. GII.4 HuNoV does not replicate in HIE cultures derived from nonsecretor individuals, while HIEs from secretors are permissive to infection. However, whether FUT2 expression alone is critical for infection remains unproven, since routinely used secretor-positive transformed cell lines are resistant to HuNoV replication. To evaluate the role of FUT2 in HuNoV replication, we used CRISPR or overexpression to genetically manipulate FUT2 gene function to produce isogenic HIE lines with or without FUT2 expression. We show that FUT2 expression alone affects both HuNoV binding to the HIE cell surface and susceptibility to HuNoV infection. These findings indicate that initial binding to a molecule(s) glycosylated by FUT2 is critical for HuNoV infection and that the HuNoV receptor is present in nonsecretor HIEs. In addition to HuNoV studies, these isogenic HIE lines will be useful tools to study other enteric microbes where infection and/or disease outcome is associated with secretor status.",

Which cellular factor(s) regulates susceptibility to HuNoV infection remains unknown. We used genetic manipulation of HIE cultures to show that secretor status determined by FUT2 gene expression is necessary and sufficient to support HuNoV replication based on analyses of isogenic lines that lack or express FUT2. Fucosylation of HBGAs is critical for initial binding and for modification of another putative receptor(s) in HIEs needed for virus uptake or uncoating and necessary for successful infection by GI.1 and several GII HuNoV strains.",

Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) is an enzyme expressed in human epithelial cells that catalyzes \u24231,2-fucosylation of the terminal galactose, preferentially on glycan type 1 chain precursors. Glycosyltransferases coded for by FUT2 along with FUT3 and ABO genes determine the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) found on the epithelial cell surface (15, 16) . Persons who lack functional FUT2 alleles do not express ABH HBGAs on epithelial cells, are designated nonsecretors, and are highly resistant to gastroenteritis caused by some HuNoV strains such as GII.4 viruses. Similarly, HIEs derived from nonsecretor individuals are not susceptible to GII.4 HuNoV infection (2) . HIEs and gastrointestinal epithelial cells of secretor-positive individuals also bind norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) (17, 21) . However, while HIEs from secretors are permissive to HuNoV replication, FUT2 expression in conventional cancer-derived cell lines is not sufficient to make cells susceptible to HuNoV replication, suggesting that HBGAs function primarily as an initial attachment factor (18, 19) . These data also lead to questions on whether there are additional genetically determined differences in HuNoV susceptibility in addition to secretor status. In this study, we evaluated the direct association between FUT2 function and HuNoV infectivity using HIEs with or without FUT2 expression in the same genetic background.",

We previously showed that GII.4 viruses can replicate in HIEs derived from secretor-positive individuals and a GII.3 strain can replicate in both secretor-positive and some secretor-negative lines, recapitulating observations seen in epidemiologic studies (2) . We determined the FUT2 (Se) and FUT3 (Le) genotypes of jejunal HIE lines and selected two lines (J2 and J4); both lines express FUT3, eliminating Lewis status as a variable in these studies ( Table 1 ). The J2 cell line is heterozygous wild type (Se/se 428 [J2Fut2 \u03e9/\u03ea ]); because the Se gene is autosomal dominant, the cells are secretor positive. The J4 line has a homozygous se 428 /se 428 (J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea ) recessive mutation and is secretor negative (20) . No other mutations associated with loss of or decreased FUT2 enzymatic function were observed in the J2 or J4 line. To better understand the importance of FUT2 in HuNoV infection, we generated isogenic knockout (KO) and knock-in (KI) HIE lines. A lentivirus-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 construct with a guide RNA targeting the FUT2 coding region was used to knock out FUT2 from J2 (J2Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea ). Single cell selection under puromycin pressure was used to isolate a clonal population, and deletions of the gene in both alleles were confirmed by sequencing. To generate the KI FUT2 line, we transduced a functional FUT2 coding sequence driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in a lentivirus into J4 (J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea/FUT2 ) cells.",

These findings indicate that, as expected, terminal fucosylation of the glycan precursor in HIEs depends on the expression of the FUT2 gene. In the secretor-negative lines, unexpected internal cellular UEA-1 staining was present that was not observed in the secretor-positive lines. To confirm that the internal staining was due to specific UEA-1 recognition of \u24231,2-fucose and not off-target binding due to loss of the specific ligand, we preincubated the UEA-1 lectin with L-fucose prior to staining. When UEA-1 was preincubated with 10 mM L-fucose, staining was not detected in the secretornegative lines and was significantly reduced in the secretor-positive lines (Fig. 2B ). After preincubation with 100 mM L-fucose, UEA-1 staining was not detected in either the secretor-negative or secretor-positive lines (Fig. 2C ).

These findings support the requirement for functional FUT2 and secretor-positive HBGAs as an initial binding factor for several strains of HuNoV that is critical for replication. Next, we assayed the J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea/FUT2 line to determine whether a genetically resistant HIE line can become susceptible with the expression of FUT2. We observed increased HuNoV binding at 1 or 2 hpi in the J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea/FUT2 line compared with the parental nonsecretor J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea line for all four HuNoV strains (Fig. 4) ; however, for GII.4, the increase was not significant. J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea/FUT2 was permissive to infection by all four viruses, based upon increases in viral genome equivalents (GEs) at 24 hpi. Interestingly, although GE levels at 1 to 2 hpi were similar, we observed greater increases in GEs for GII.17 and GI.1 HuNoVs in J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea/FUT2 cells than in J2Fut2 \u03e9/\u03ea cells at 24 hpi. This suggests that additional factors that vary between individual HIE lines, aside from secretor status, may influence the replication of these two strains. Taken together, these results show that functional FUT2 is sufficient and critical for replication of multiple HuNoV strains and that GII.3 is capable of infection in some secretor-negative HIE lines.",

            "text": "Virus attachment and entry into the infected cell are complex processes, and the exact role of fucosylated molecules in HuNoV entry remains to be determined. It is likely that initial binding of secretor-dependent HuNoVs to HIEs is regulated by fucosylation, with the attachment factors being fucosylated. However, it is unclear whether the fucosylated molecules serve only as the initial attachment factor that then facilitates interaction with a virus-specific receptor or whether the fucosylated molecules function as a virus receptor themselves; examples of both mechanisms have been described previously with nonfucosylated glycans (22) . For example, reovirus binding to its proteinaceous JAM-A receptor is enhanced by initial binding to sialic acid residues (23), while human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid receptors (24) and influenza viruses bind to terminal sialic acid receptors (25) . If fucosylated molecules serve only as attachment factors, then the virus receptor(s) for secretordependent HuNoVs is present in both secretor-positive and secretor-negative HIEs and is not expressed in other nonsusceptible, secretor-positive cancer-derived or trans- We observed a striking phenotypic difference in FUT2-expressing HIE cells compared to cells not expressing FUT2. UEA-1 detection of \u24231,2-fucose was observed exclusively at the apical surface in FUT2-positive cells. Unexpectedly, in the secretor-negative lines, there was internal cellular staining by UEA-1. The staining was due to UEA-1-specific interactions with \u24231,2-fucose, indicating that these glycan structures are present but unable to transit to the surfaces of the secretor-negative HIE cultures. There is evidence that FUT2 expression leads to surface expression of \u24231,2-fucosylated molecules. This was shown in specific-pathogen-free mice, where the lumen of the small intestine is mostly lacking in surface fucosylation, and intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates expression of \u24231,2-fucosylated molecules at the surface in a FUT2-dependent manner (27, 28) . There may be additional fucosyltransferase enzymes present in our HIEs capable of adding fucose to glycoproteins or glycolipids in the absence of FUT2 activity. However, these alternatively fucosylated molecules are unable to transit to the cell surface. Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1), expressed in erythroid cells and some other tissues, is also capable of adding \u24231,2-fucose, although preferentially on glycan chains other than those found in intestinal epithelia. In the parental J2 enteroid line used in this study, FUT1 transcripts are expressed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), and the fragment per kilobase per million (FPKM) value is Fig. 3 . Total well RNA was extracted, and GEs were determined by RT-qPCR. Each data bar represents the mean for three wells of inoculated HIE monolayers. Error bars denote SD. Each experiment was performed two or more times, with three technical replicates in each experiment. Numbers above the bars indicate log 10 fold change comparing GEs at 24 hpi to 1 or 2 hpi. Significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with post hoc analysis using Tukey's test (*, P \u03fd 0.05; n.s., not significant).",

Fuc\u24231,2Gal antigen expression was not detected on the apical surfaces of cell lines with no functional FUT2 gene (J2Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea and J4Fut2 \u03ea/\u03ea images in panel A). H antigen expression was analyzed by UEA-1 lectin (red) in HIE lines. (B and C) Specificity for UEA-1 lectin detection of Fuc\u24231,2Gal antigen in all enteroid lines is demonstrated by the reduction of staining when UEA-1 was preincubated with either 10 mM (B) or 100 mM (C) L-fucose. (D to F) Graphical quantitation of fluorescence is shown below the image panels. Each data bar represents the mean fluorescence from six total wells collected from two experiments. Error bars denote SD. For each enteroid line, significant differences in fluorescence comparing no L-fucose pretreatment of UEA-1 (D) to 10 mM (E) or 100 mM (F) pretreatment were determined by Student's t test (*, P \u03fd 0.05). In all image panels, the nuclei are marked with DAPI (blue), Fuc\u24231,2Gal antigen was detected by UEA-1 lectin (red), and the brush border is indicated by actin expression using phalloidin (white).
