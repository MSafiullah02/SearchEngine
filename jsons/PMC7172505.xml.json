Rhinosinusitis and asthma are 2 common respiratory diseases that have been linked together on a clinical, as well as a pathophysiologic, basis (Fig. 1\n). In this review, associations between rhinosinusitis and asthma will be explored, with particular emphasis placed on the role of infections and inflammation.",

For example, RSV infections in infancy are a risk factor for developing allergic asthma in adolescence.15, 16, 17 Likewise, human rhinovirus in infants was also associated with higher incidence of having asthma as an adult.18, 19, 20, 21 Elucidating the key mechanistic links between specific viral (or bacterial) pathogens and development of new onset asthma is critical not only for better understanding of the link between the upper and lower respiratory tract but also for identifying potentially modifiable factors that could lead to disease prevention.",

One hypothesis suggests that the bacteria itself is directly involved in driving CRS pathogenesis, damaging the epithelial barrier and activating the host immune response. Ex vivo studies of nasal polyp explants infected with S aureus showed reduced gene expression levels of various tight junction proteins when compared with similarly infected healthy nasal mucosa.80 In addition, in a separate study, S aureus was reported to bind to TLR2 and induce type 2 cytokine release from cultured epithelial cells.81 This in turn could potentially explain how colonization with S aureus in the nasal cavity could lead to the development of a chronic immunologic response. However, what is not addressed in these studies is why only some patients who are colonized with S aureus go on to develop CRS. Furthermore, in patients with CRSwNP, the presence of S aureus was associated with more severe sinus inflammation on CT scans but not sinonasal symptoms, suggesting this pathogen alone is not fully responsible for all aspects of disease.82\n",

In addition, there are significant variations between studies with differences in the patient demographics, where within the sinonasal cavity samples were collected, how the data were generated, and the methods by which the data were analyzed. To date, no one particular pathogen has been implicated in CRS, but an overall increased abundance and decreased diversity of the microbiome has been observed.104, 105 It is thus likely that differences in the microbiome are important in CRS pathogenesis and in the link between CRS and asthma.

In acute rhinosinusitis, exposures to viral and bacterial pathogens are the primary driver for acute inflammation in the nose, which can then lead to exacerbations of asthma. In contrast, it remains unclear what precise role infections (or colonization) in the airways play in the development of CRS, but other factors, including the presence of an impaired epithelial barrier and dysregulated immune responses, can promote the chronic inflammation that is observed in CRS. Clinically, CRS is strongly associated with asthma with both diseases sharing similar underlying inflammatory processes. In conclusion, significant advancements have been made in identifying sinus infections and inflammation as important in asthma pathogenesis, but additional work is needed to further define the specific mechanisms responsible for connecting the nose with the lungs.",
