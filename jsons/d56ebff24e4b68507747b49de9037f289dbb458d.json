(6) It is worth noting the variability in clinical presentation of cutaneous findings following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case 1 developed maculopapular lesions three days after symptom onset while 9 Case 2 presented with urticarial plaques 9 days after becoming symptomatic. Similarly, we observed a diversity of morphological presentations and variability in time to onset of cutaneous manifestations in the literature (4) (5) (6) . It is unlikely that our patients' rashes were due to a medication reaction as there had been no changes to their medication regimen, the rashes had an acute onset following COVID-19 symptom onset, and, in Case 1, the biopsy did not illustrate tissue eosinophilia.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2), has quickly developed into a global pandemic and public health emergency.(1) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily produces fever and respiratory symptoms, though involvement of other organ systems has been reported, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal manifestations .(2) The cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are largely unknown but case reports and case series are accumulating in the literature . Here we describe two patients with cutaneous eruptions following SARS-CoV-2 infection and review the known literature on COVID-19 related dermatological manifestations.CASE REPORTCase 1 was a 60-year-old male physician with a history of a mitral valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and depression who was seen for a sudden onset asymptomatic rash on the back, flanks, groin and upper thighs. Three days prior, he had developed flu-like symptoms including a low-grade fever (38 \u00b0C ), myalgias, fatigue and a mild cough. His only medications were apixaban and duloxetine, and he had no known drug or food allergies. There were no recent changes to his medications. Additionally, no over the counter remedies, antibiotics, antivirals or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had been initiated. SARS-CoV-2 rapid respiratory panel resulted in a positive test result but the patient was not tested for other viruses. On presentation to the authors, he was found to have scattered erythematous macules coalescing into papules on the back, bilateral flanks, groin, and proximal lower extremities (Figure 1a). No mucosal lesions were observed, nor was there any conjunctival injection or erythema. A punch biopsy specimen from the lower back revealed a mild perivascular infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells surrounding the superficial blood vessels(Figure 2). The epidermis showed scattered foci of hydropic changes along with minimal acanthosis, slight spongiosis and foci of parakeratosis. On the basis of both clinical and histologic findings, a diagnosis of a viral exanthem was made. The patient was advised to self-isolate for 7 days from the time of symptom onset and until he was fever-free for 72 hours without the use of feverreducing medications. The patient recovered from his infection and did not require hospitalization. One week later, small round purpuric macules were seen in the formerly involved areas(Figure 1b).Case 2 was a 60-year-old woman with a history of a task-specific focal dystonia, mild hemi-facial atrophy and scoliosis who presented to the dermatology department with a 6-hour history of sudden onset, generalized, pruritic rash on the trunk, head, upper and lower extremities. Nine days prior, she had developed flu-like symptoms including a low-grade fever (38.2 \u00b0C ), myalgias, fatigue, and a mild cough. Additionally, she developed gastrointestinal symptoms including lower abdominal discomfort and loose stools. Her only medication was estradiol, which she had been taking for many months prior to her visit, and she had a documented allergy to propofol. There were no recent changes to her medications. No over the counter remedies, antibiotics, antivirals, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had been initiated. SARS-CoV-2 rapid respiratory panel resulted in a positive test result but she was not tested for other respiratory viruses. On presentation to the authors, she was found to have large, disseminated, urticarial plaques across the trunk, abdomen, head, and upper and lower extremities (Figure 3). 8 There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival erythema. On the basis of clinical findings, a diagnosis of acute urticaria was made. The patient was given 180 mg of fexofenadine every 12 hours, resulting in complete resolution of the lesions within the ensuing 24 hours. The patient was advised to self-isolate under the same guidelines provided to Case 1. The patient recovered from her infection without sequelae and did not require hospitalization. Urticarial lesions did not recur upon her discontinuation of the fexofenadine 1 week after starting.DISCUSSIONIt has been documented that COVID-19 can induce a significant systemic inflammatory response, potentially leading to end-organ injury.(3) While the integumentary system may be similarly affected, data is limited. One study from Italy analyzed the incidence of cutaneous manifestations in a group of 88 COVID-19 patients.(4) Dermatologic manifestations were noted in 18 (20.4%) patients and included descriptions such as an erythematous rash (16%), widespread urticaria (3%), and chickenpox-like vesicles (1%), all primarily involving the trunk.(4)",
