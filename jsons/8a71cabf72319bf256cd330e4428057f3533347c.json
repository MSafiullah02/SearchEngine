Therapy with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in CML patients implies a modest increase in the risk of infection, most likely due to offtarget inhibition of kinases involved in immune cell function. 11 Neither chronic phase CML nor BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce a state of clinically significant immune suppression, and no data are suggesting that chronic phase CML patients may be at higher risk of infection by the novel SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population. 12 Thus, assuming that chronic phase CML patients on TKI are not at higher risk of developing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, discontinuation of TKI treatment is not recommended prophylactically or in the presence of unconfirmed compatible symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, as it may lead to loss of response and CML relapse/progression, which could be problematic if regular monitoring of CBC counts and BCR-ABL transcripts was reduced due to lack of lab access during the current pandemic. Similarly, in patients with resistance or intolerance to the current TKI, it is not advisable to delay a change in therapy since the results may be compromised. In case of severe SARS-CoV-2, TKI interruption should be discussed on a case-to-case basis.",

            "text": "In the context of the current pandemic, it is essential to note that TKIs have previously been shown to be effective against other coronaviruses. In 2014 a paper was published in which 290 compounds were screened for antiviral activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Twenty-seven compounds were identified to be active against both strains. Among those, three inhibitors of the kinase signaling pathway were present, two (imatinib mesylate and dasatinib) that are active against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and one (nilotinib) that inhibits SARS-CoV only. The authors suggested that the ABL pathway may be essential for the replication of many different virus families and, therefore, inhibitors of this pathway have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals. Mechanistic studies revealed that Abl1 tyrosine kinase regulates budding or release of poxviruses and the Ebola virus. These results demonstrate that c-Abl1 kinase signaling pathways play a critical role in viral egress and suggest that these pathways may also be important in coronavirus replication. 13 Follow up research also identified the mechanisms by which TKIs act during coronavirus infection. This work showed that all enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, must first fuse with cellular membranes or with endosomes prior to injection of viral RNA into the host cytoplasm for replication and that TKIs inhibit this process. 14 It appears that imatinib has anti-coronavirus activity in two points of the virus life cycle. In the early phases of infection, it inhibits virion fusion with the endosome and subsequent release into the cytoplasm, thus preventing viral entry and viral replication via Ablmediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. In a later phase of the infection, Abl2 protein expression, which is inhibited by both imatinib and dasatinib, enables SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication. These data suggest that Abl2 is a novel host cell protein required for viral growth. 15 Together these studies recognize a possible protective role of the TKIs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even in our patient, although her husband needed hospitalization with respiratory support, together with an older member of the family, the viral infection showed mild symptoms, resolved with nonspecific anti-inflammatory therapy and antibiotics.",
