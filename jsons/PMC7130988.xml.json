Several assays can be used to detect the presence of virus. Viral genomes and gene products can be detected using RT-PCR [1], [2] and genetic micro-arrays [3], [4]. Whereas virus neutralization, haemagglutination inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been used for the detection of viral specific antibodies or viral proteins [5]. In several cases combinations of both genome and protein detection methods can be used as is the case with a combined RT-PCR-ELISA approach to identify and differentiate alphavirus infections [6].",

However, whilst many viruses can be grown in cell culture or eggs, they may not grow to sufficient titre to produce enough protein for purification, coupled with the difficulties associated with purifying native un-tagged protein. Likewise some viruses cannot be cultured, yet gene sequence is available for their proteins. Therefore, given these potential limitations, recombinant protein expression technology has the potential to provide a reliable source of antigens but has not yet been widely used in ELISA kits for the diagnosis of viral disease.",

            "text": "Several factors should be taken into consideration when selecting suitable antigens for protein-based expression, including specificity and post-translational modifications. The key factor being that the protein can detect antibody induced by natural or vaccine immunogens. When developing protein-based ELISA systems for the detection of viruses, as with preparing proteins from purified virus, several candidate proteins can be considered such as the surface glycoproteins and capsid proteins. Both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Surface glycoproteins tend to be the major inducers of neutralizing antibodies and therefore the host is likely to produce antibodies to these proteins. However, because such proteins are modified post-translation with the addition of sugar moieties, the correctly folded protein can only be produced in a eukaryotic system. Additionally, given their role in virus attachment and the fact that they provoke a large antibody response these proteins are highly variable, and as such antibodies to them may only recognise certain strains of the same virus family. On the other hand the role of nucleocapsid proteins in binding to the virus genome is fundamental to the success of the virus life cycle. When considering RNA viruses, given the constraints on RNA sequence in terms of structure and function, such proteins tend to be more conserved between divergent strains than the proteins encoding surface glycoproteins. Therefore, a nucleocapsid protein from one strain when used in recombinant protein-based ELISA should be recognised not only by antibodies raised against itself but also by antibodies raised against nucleocapsid proteins from other strains of the same virus. Recombinant nucleocapsid proteins from different viruses have been used in a wide variety of ELISAs. For example, the Nipah virus nucleocapsid protein [9], the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], the hepatitis C virus core protein [14] and even peptides [15], [16] or sub-regions of these proteins can be used [17], [18]. Therefore, careful selection of recombinant proteins can lead to the generation of both generic virus and strain-specific ELISAs. For example, a peptide ELISA based upon the ORF4 envelope glycoprotein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can be used to differentiate between virus strains [19].",

One of the most commonly used expression systems in use is the bacterium E. coli. Proteins can be produced in large quantities due to the robust nature of the culture conditions; however, these proteins are not post-transitionally modified. Alternatively, the protein can be produced in insect cells utilising baculovirus expression vectors which encode the recombinant protein of interest [20]. Here, the protein is post-translationally modified and typical yields of the recombinant protein can be similar to those from E. coli\n[21]. The only caveat with insect cells such as SF9 cells is that certain post-translational modifications will be different than if the protein were expressed in mammalian cells [22], [23]. This is especially true of glycosylation since in insect cells the number of glycan residues added is typically less than mammalian cells.",

As discussed, the modifications added by insect cells to exogenous proteins may be different from those added in the native infected cells [25] and may therefore affect their ability to efficiently distinguish between different viral strains [8]. For example, in the case of PRRSV this is particularly relevant when considering the N-linked glycosylaiton of the GP5 protein, in which the loss of glycan residues in the ectodomain of GP5 enhances both the sensitivity of these viruses to in vitro neutralization and the immunogenicity of the nearby neutralization epitope [26].",

One such system is Roche's ProteoMaster which is designed for optimum cell free protein expression utilising simultaneous transcription and translation. Proteins for expression can either be cloned into an appropriate expression vector or templates synthesized by PCR, in this latter instance a prokaryotic promoter (e.g. the T7 promoter), affinity tags and other features are incorporated in non-templated primers. The cell free expression system utilises translation competent extracts from either E. coli or wheat germ, and different amounts of protein can be produced. In large scale preparations, the reaction chamber is divided in two. One which contains is a reaction compartment for coupled transcription and translation from the translation extract, and the other a feeding compartment for substrates and energy components, thus simplifying purification of the recombinant protein. Up to 150 mg of protein can be produced in 24 h, although currently the cost per mg is greater than conventional expression in E. coli. The ProteoMaster itself provides optimal protein expression conditions by regulating the reaction temperature and by smooth shaking that supports the continuous exchange between reaction and feeding chamber.",

Alternatively, several prediction methodologies are available that allow the analysis of a given protein sequence for potential epitopes [35], [36], [37], [38]. The disadvantage of a peptide based approach over producing the whole recombinant protein is that the epitopes have to be mapped and evaluated in ELISA, which can require time and expense. Although as with recombinant proteins, several peptides from the same of different antigens could be used to improve sensitivity. In general peptide synthesis can achieve lengths of 30 amino acids, which is normally enough to cover an epitope. The advantage of using peptides is the ease of synthesis and purity of preparation.",

Affinity tags are normally (but not necessarily) short amino acid motifs which have a high affinity for an antibody or metal, which can be used to facilitate protein purification or identification in a cell \u2013 e.g. using immunofluoresence. They are added N- or C-terminally to a protein during the cloning step. For example, large soluble tags placed N-terminally to the protein of interest can greatly increase solubility and enhance expression as the ribosome will encounter the tag first, allowing it to begin elongation before reaching the gene to be translated [42]. Indeed some studies indicate that addition of a his-tag increases expression in E. coli\n[43]. N-terminal tags do however confer a major disadvantage when attempting to purify expressed protein. Expression of an exogenous protein often leads to the production of truncated peptides due to premature termination of translation caused by rare codons and inefficient translation due to the activation of host stress responses. When expressed with an N-terminal tag these truncated products can be affinity purified alongside full-length protein and can be to difficult to remove even by size-exclusion methods, as they are often very similar in size to full-length product. Whereas affinity purification via a C-terminal tag can more easily be used to determine whether any protein bound to the affinity matrix is full length (if no other antibodies are available) [8]. Double tag purification systems may overcome this difficulty [44].",

Immobilised metal-affinity chromatography relies on the stable interactions between histidine and a metal such as nickel or zinc [45]. This interaction is extremely stable, owing to electron donor groups on the imidazole ring of histidine forming coordination bonds with the zinc. Due to their small size, often just six amino acids in length or sometimes placed in tandem [46], histidine tags are thought to have little effect on the overall structure of the purified protein (over half of the proteins on the protein data base contain a his-tag), alleviating the requirement for cleavage post-purification.",

Despite these systems being based on the same basic principle, these variations can preclude efficient purification of recombinant protein and thorough investigation into a number of products is required to achieve optimal purification. The major disadvantage of utilising a histidine tag in purification is the existence of host cell proteins that may contain a number of adjacent histidines, these proteins also have high affinity for the transition metal matrix and are often affinity purified with the protein of interest [47]. This may lead to the requirement of a two-step purification strategy [42] in which the affinity purification is followed by a size-exclusion or ionic exchange chromatography step. This need for further purification following histidine affinity purification can be time consuming and may lead to reductions in the yield of purified protein produced. A number of larger tags which confer greater specificity, such as glutathione S transferase (GST) [48], [49], alleviate this requirement for a second step to remove contaminating proteins, as the occurrence of host proteins with similar domains is uncommon. These larger tags do however necessitate a second step in which the large tag is cleaved and removed by a further round of affinity purification. Therefore, if the smaller and more convenient histidine tag is suitable then its use allows rapid and simple purification of recombinant protein to be achieved.",

For example, the tRNA AGA is responsible for over 15% of arginines in a mammalian cell compared to only 2.6% in E. coli. When rare codons occur within the gene of interest at a high frequency the resulting protein product is often truncated [50], due to translation stuttering or stopping at each codon for which the host doesn\u2019t have sufficient amino-acyl tRNAs [51]. Many systems are available for addressing this problem such as the use of specific E. coli strains, cell free systems and plasmids encoding rare tRNAs [52], [53].",

Comparison using E. coli expressed SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (a virion surface glycoprotein) versus the nucleocapsid protein indicated that the latter protein was a better candidate antigen for use in diagnostic ELISA [64]. However, subsequent research suggested that nucleoprotein-based ELISA lead to the false positive detection of two human coronaviruses (HCoV), HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E and that the additional use of a recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein western blot analysis differentiated between the different viruses [65]. Indeed false positives may be caused by the use of bacterial expressed antigens [66] with incorrect protein folding (and hence epitope presentation) through lack of suitable post-translational modification.",

The ability to produced recombinant proteins will ensure that future ELISAs are safe (as there is no live virus), low background (only virus antigens are present) and specific (single viral proteins can be used). The ability to synthesize recombinant proteins (or peptides) in the laboratory allows easy scale up for the commercial manufacture of ELISA kits [8]. The clear advantage of recombinant protein/peptide is that high quality assurance is clear, especially with peptides as these can be manufactured synthetically, in the absence of any other proteins. This latter point being the most crucial advantage of recombinant based proteins ELISAs in that even if a virus cannot be cultured, provided gene sequence is available, it is possible to rapidly respond to emerging viruses and new viral strains of existing pathogens. Combinations of peptides or chimeric recombinant proteins should allow the development of strain-specific and generic detection reagents. This is especially true in the case of differentiating vaccines based on recombinant (genetically manipulated) viruses. In this case virus proteins are modified to contain an exogenous epitope/tag, or a foreign protein is expressed in entirety. Thus because antibodies are raised against the tags, recombinant vaccine strains which can be readily distinguished from wild type and parental strains using recombinant protein/peptide based ELISA [43], [67], [68].",
