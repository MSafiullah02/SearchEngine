Heterozygous variants of SETD1A involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation were previously identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we define the clinical features of the Mendelian syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of SETD1A by investigating 15 predominantly pediatric individuals who all have de novo SETD1A variants. These individuals present with a core set of symptoms comprising global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, subtle facial dysmorphisms, behavioral and psychiatric problems. We examined cellular phenotypes in three patient derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with three variants: p.Gly535Alafs*12, c.4582-2_4582delAG, and p.Tyr1499Asp. These patient cell lines displayed DNA damage repair defects that were comparable to previously observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A. This suggested that these variants, including the p.Tyr1499Asp in the catalytic SET domain, behave as Loss-of-Function (LoF) alleles. Previous studies demonstrated a role for SETD1A in cell cycle control and differentiation. However, individuals with SETD1A variants do not show major structural brain defects or severe microcephaly, suggesting that defective proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors is unlikely the single underlying cause of the disorder. We show here that the Drosophila Melanogaster SETD1A orthologue is required in postmitotic neurons of the fly brain for normal memory, suggesting a role in post development neuronal function. Together, this study defines a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dominant de novo LoF variants in SETD1A and further supports a role for H3K4 methyltransferases in the regulation of neuronal processes underlying normal cognitive functioning.",

It is also expressed in a few cells of the ventral nerve chord, which appear to be chordotonal sensory neurons involved in balance and locomotion. We obtained three different Set1 UAS-RNAi transgenes that target different parts of the Set1 mRNA. We tested the RNAi potency by crossing RNAi stocks to the ubiquitous actin-Gal4 driver. As Set1 is an essential gene this would be expected to induce lethality. While Set1 RNAi1 and Set1 RNAi2 did induce lethality, Set1 RNAi3 did not, suggesting that the Set1 RNAi3 line is less potent. As a control, we used an mCherry RNAi strain (mCherry RNAi ) that had the same genetic background as the Set1 RNAi strains.",

In previous studies heterozygous LoF variants in SETD1A were observed in individuals with schizophrenia 14 . Therefore, in this study we investigated the behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities that have been observed in our predominantly pediatric cohort. No patient had a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia, but this is expected because of the relatively young age of the patients. With the exception of the very rare childhood onset forms 47 , schizophrenia rarely manifests so early 48 . Interestingly, an adolescent and a young adult from our cohort (age 16 years and 23 years) showed signs that could be linked with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, though they had no formal psychiatric diagnosis. Combined with the previous reports, this indicates that the germline SETD1A variants might predispose individuals to severe neuropsychiatric pathologies later in life. Therefore, this patient group should be carefully monitored for suggestive psychiatric symptoms.",

In the three other studies describing patients with variants in SETD1A, the exact same variant was found in 7 out of the total of 16 patients 14, 23, 24 . In addition, this variant occurs at a frequency of 8.071e -6 in the GnomAD database 40 . Authors from the previous studies did not speculate on this seemingly unlikely recurrence of the two bp deletion 14, 24 . However, it raises questions on the frequency and etiology of occurrence of this variant. It is possible that the mutation rate in this genomic area, or specifically around these two base pairs, is relatively high. This may be due to the surrounding sequence homology or the epigenetic state of the DNA, which in turn may allow this deletion to occur. Another explanation might be ascertainment bias, due to the possibility that the specific variant gives rise to ID and/or schizophrenia. Whereas other SETD1A variants might also be causative for other phenotypes and therefore would not be included in studies focusing on ID or schizophrenia. In addition, it might be that the c.4582-2_4582-1delAG variant is a so-called selfish mutation. Certain DNA variants that can occur over time in spermatogonial cells can lead to clonal expansion (such as the c.755C>G variant in the FGFR2 gene in the case of Apert syndrome). This can culminate to the passing of that certain variant from father to child, leading to a higher prevalence in the patient group. Typically these variants are 'Gain of Function' (GoF) 55, 56 , so in our cohort this does not seem to be the case.",

Interestingly, this latter variant, (c.4582-2_4582delAG) was identified in two different patients but had also been identified previously14 . To determine any effects of this splice-site variant on the SETD1A transcript, RT-PCR was performed on cells from individual 15, amplifying a region between exon 14 and 18. The resulting product shows that the transcript produced in individual 15 differs from the wildtype transcript. Sequencing of the amplified PCR-products revealed that the variant causes an insertion of 81 base pairs between exon 15 and 16, showing that intron 15 is not spliced. This insertion is in frame, but the N-SET domain, which is important for methyltransferase activity, is interrupted (Supplementary",

In the presence of normal learning and memory, male flies reduce futile courtship behavior in response to sexual rejection by a non-receptive mated female. In this assay, male flies are trained by pairing with a premated female that rejects male courtship attempts. After 1-hour of training, the CI was significantly reduced in the mCherry RNAi control and the less potent Set1 RNAi3 when compared to na\u00efve flies of the same genotype, indicating normal short-term memory (STM) (Figure 4A, left panel). In contrast, there was no significant reduction in CI after training for Set1 RNAi1 and Set1 RNAi2 , indicating defective memory upon Set1 knockdown in postmitotic MB neurons.

This suggests that courtship conditioning defects are not due to defects in locomotion or baseline courtship ability. It also suggests that memory defects likely arise from the role of Set1 in the MB cells, and not the chordotonal sensory neurons that are also targeted by R14H06-Gal4. Disruption of chordotonal organ function would be expected to cause severe defects in balance and locomotion, which clearly are not observed upon Set1 knockdown with R14H06-Gal4. R14H06-Gal4 is expressed in the larval MB as well as the adult MB. During larval and pupal development, postmitotic MB neurons undergo morphological changes that are required for normal wiring of the adult fly brain. We asked if memory defects in MB Set1 knockdown flies result from morphological abnormalities arising from defects in MB development. To test this, we labelled R14H06-Gal4 neurons by co-expression of a membrane targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) and",
