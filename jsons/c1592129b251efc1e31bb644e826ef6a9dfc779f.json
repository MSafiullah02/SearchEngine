            "text": "Arrhythmia detection by classifying ECG heartbeats is an important research topic for healthcare. Recently, deep learning models have been increasingly applied to ECG classification. Among them, most methods work in three steps: preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation and beat-wise classification. However, this methodology has two drawbacks. First, explicit heartbeat segmentation can undermine model simplicity and compactness. Second, beat-wise classification risks losing inter-heartbeat context information that can be useful to achieving high classification performance. Addressing these drawbacks, we propose a novel deep learning model that can simultaneously conduct heartbeat segmentation and classification. Compared to existing methods, our model is more compact as it does not require explicit heartbeat segmentation. Moreover, our model is more context-aware, for it takes into account the relationship between heartbeats. To achieve simultaneous segmentation and classification, we present a Faster R-CNN based model that has been customized to handle ECG data. To characterize inter-heartbeat context information, we exploit inverted residual blocks and a novel feature fusion subroutine that combines average pooling with max-pooling. Extensive experiments on the well-known MIT-BIH database indicate that our method can achieve competitive results for ECG segmentation and classification.",

            "text": "Arrhythmia occurs when the heart rhythms are irregular, which can lead to serious organ damage. Arrhythmias can be caused by high blood pressure, heart diseases, etc [1] . Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most popular tools for arrhythmia diagnosis. To manually handle long ECG recordings with thousands of heartbeats, clinicians have to determine the class of each heartbeat to detect arrhythmias, which is highly costly. Therefore, great efforts have been made to create computer-aided diagnosis tools that can detect irregular heartbeats automatically. In recent years, deep learning models have been gradually applied to ECG classification. Among them, most methods work in three steps: preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation and beat-wise classification (see Sect. 2). The preprocessing step removes various kinds of noise from raw signals, the heartbeat segmentation step identifies individual heartbeats, and the beat-wise classification step classifies each heartbeat. This methodology has the following drawbacks: First, explicit heartbeat segmentation can undermine model simplicity and compactness. Traditional heartbeat segmentation methods explicitly extract ECG features for QRS detection. Since deep learning methods can produce feature maps from raw data, heartbeat segmentation can be simultaneously conducted with classification with a single neural network. Second, beat-wise classification uses isolated heartbeats, which risks losing inter-heartbeat context information that can be useful to boosting classification performance.",

Hannun et al. [15] proposed a 33-layer neural network for arrhythmia detection which maps ECG data to a sequence of labels. However, the precise regions of arrhythmias cannot be obtained. Oh et al. [16] used a modified U-net to identify regions of heartbeats and the background from raw signals, yet this method needs extra steps to detect arrhythmias from the generated annotation. Several researches applies Faster R-CNN to ECG analysis. For example, Ji et al. [17] proposed a heartbeat classification framework based on Faster R-CNN. 1-D heartbeats extracted from original signals are converted to images as the input of the model. Sophisticated preprocessing is required before classification. He et al. [18] and Yu et al. [19] use Faster R-CNN to perform heartbeat segmentation and QRS complex detection. In our method, we present a modified Faster R-CNN for arrhythmia detection which works in only two steps: preprocessing, and simultaneous heartbeat segmentation and classification.",

(2) The activation function is replaced by ELU for less information loss. (3) The residual connection is added to the building block in stride 2 condition. There are two branches in stride 2 condition (Fig. 3) . (4) Stride 2 convolution is replaced by max-pooling to make the model more lightweight. There are 6 layers in our backbone. Each layer is composed of several building blocks (Fig. 3) . Besides, each layer downsamples the feature map by a factor of two. Different from most deep learning methods which compute feature maps for a single heartbeat, our backbone model takes a long ECG sequence as its input. The produced feature maps encode not only morphological and semantic information of individual heartbeats, but also context information amongst multiple heartbeats. The bottom layers of the backbone generate feature maps of strong morphological information while the top layers produce feature maps of strong semantic information [21] . Moreover, the receptive field increases from bottom layers to top layers, thus the feature maps encode involve inter-heartbeat context dependencies with varying differences in time.",

Following the practice of Faster R-CNN [2] , at each position of a feature map, we pre-define three reference regions. These regions have different sizes (128, 192, 256 for ECG heartbeats).

To demonstrate the effectiveness of these design choices, we conducted the following ablation tests: 1) setting the kernel size to 3 for all convolution filters, 2) using the feature maps in the top layers only, 3) using the feature maps in the bottom layers only, 4) equalize the output sizes of multi-scale feature maps in the region pooling block. Figure 6 and Table 3 presents the results in the segmentation and classification tasks. As is shown, while the effectiveness of these design features in the segmentation task is limited, they are indeed beneficial to the classification task. Figure 7 and Table 4 show the results. By modifying the backbone, our model can learn more strong features to improve performance. Our downsampling method also outperforms using only max-pooling or average pooling.",
