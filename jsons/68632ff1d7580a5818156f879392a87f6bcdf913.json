Traditionally, acetylacetone is manufactured through chemical routes using acetone and ketene, which is produced by pyrolysis of acetone or acetic acid at a temperature of 700-800 \u00b0C, with carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen formed as by-products [2, 3] . In specific, esterification of ketene and acetone forms isopropenyl acetate (IPA), in the presence of a strong acid catalyst. Then, IPA is transformed into acetylacetone at 500-600 \u00b0C with metallic molybdenum as a catalyst, whereby the yield is only about 45%. In conclusion, the chemical routes suffer from drawbacks such as multiple steps, harsh conditions, low yield, and environmental problems, which hamper further applications of petrochemical-based acetylacetone. To address the issue, new methods need to be developed for acetylacetone preparation.

A strain of Acinetobacter johnsonii was isolated and proved to have the ability to utilize acetylacetone as a sole carbon source. To reveal the decomposition mechanism, a novel C-C bond-cleaving enzyme, acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme (Dke1, EC 1.13.11.50), was found and purified from A. johnsonii [9] . The Dke1 enzyme can activate oxygen to cleave acetylacetone into acetate and methylglyoxal, followed by the conversion of methylglyoxal into lactate by glyoxalase. However, the natural biosynthesis of acetylacetone has not yet been reported. In previous studies, some non-natural products had been bio-synthesized by reversing their biodegradation pathway. An artificial biosynthetic pathway to methylacetoin was constructed by redirecting the methylacetoin biodegradation, and the titer achieved at 3.4 g/L by enzyme screening and metabolic engineering [4] . The direct biocatalytic route of 1,4-butanediol mirroring its biodegradation pathway was reported with a production of 18 g/L [10] . In addition, the engineered reversal of the \u03b2-oxidation cycle was adopted for fatty-acid-derived compounds' biosynthesis, and a series of short-, medium-, and long-chain products were obtained at high yields [11] [12] [13] . These successful cases provided a possible strategy to our research for acetylacetone biosynthesis.",

Methylglyoxal can be produced marginally through glycolysis [14] , and acetate is a major product during sugar fermentation especially under anaerobic conditions. Thus, we proposed to achieve acetylacetone production from methylglyoxal and acetate by redirecting the reaction. As shown in Fig. 1 , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from glycolysis pathway was converted into glycerone phosphate and methylglyoxal by the action of triosephosphate isomerase (TpiA) and methylglyoxal synthase (MgsA), respectively. Acetyl-CoA was converted into acetate by acetate kinase. Methylglyoxal and acetate were finally transformed into acetylacetone by Dke1.",

The expression of the Dke1 was first checked by SDS-PAGE, and the corresponding bands with molecular weights of 17 kDa were observed clearly (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). The resulting Fig. 1 Biodegradation-inspired biosynthetic pathway of acetylacetone. Acetylacetone biodegradation is presented with a dashed line, and the constructed biosynthetic pathways are presented using a solid line. The enzymes used are as follows: AckA, acetate kinase; TpiA, triose-phosphate isomerase; MgsA, methylglyoxal synthase; Dke1, acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme strain Q3030 was cultured under shake-flask conditions, and the fermentation products were analyzed by GC-MS. However, no acetylacetone was detected. We then referred back to the acetylacetone biodegradation pathway. As the biodegradation of acetylacetone was activated by oxygen, we speculated the biosynthesis direction was suppressed under aerobic conditions. Thus, anaerobic cultivation in a sealed serum bottle with nitrogen was carried out for further verification. This time, the production of acetylacetone was confirmed by GC-MS analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , a specific peak with a mass of 100 Da was detected, and dissociation of this ion led to other masses such as 43 and 85 Da, exactly the same with acetylacetone standard. Under this condition, the concentration of acetylacetone in fermentation broth was 32.6 \u00b1 1.0 mg/L. Furthermore, the production of acetylacetone was also performed in vitro in Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing purified Dke1 protein, methylglyoxal and ammonium acetate at 37 \u00b0C, and 129.5 \u00b1 8.9 mg/L acetylacetone was accumulated in 24 h.

As one of the main metabolites in E. coli under anaerobic condition, acetate should be sufficient for acetylacetone biosynthesis. But in general, methylglyoxal synthesis is inhibited in cell [14, 17] . So the methylglyoxal content in the flask was improved by extra supplement with a concentration of 0.1 mM or overexpression of the key genes (tpiA and mgsA) for enhanced acetylacetone production ( Fig. 1) . However, no more acetylacetone was accumulated. Meanwhile, the in vitro experiment with 20 mM methylglyoxal was conducted, and the production of acetylacetone (128.9 \u00b1 8.6 mg/L) did not show significant difference with that with 10 mM methylglyoxal (p = 0.94). So, we speculated that low activity of Dke1 might be the primary reason of low acetylacetone yield. Then, the acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme was first screened. Two more genes encoding acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme from Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400 (P_Dke1, accession No. NC_007951.1) and Tistrella mobilis (T_Dke1, accession No. NC_017966.1) were cloned and used for acetylacetone production. Unfortunately, no acetylacetone was detected using engineered strains with P_Dke1 or T_Dke1. So, other strategies should be considered for higher acetylacetone production.",

In the crystal structure of the ligand-free Dke1, the Fe 2+ -coordinating His-62, His-64 and His-104 comprise the substrate catalytic center [21] . The definitely conserved sites occupy about three quarters of the substrate channel, which are the most important amino acid residues for maintaining structure and function of the proteins (Additional file 1: Fig. S2 ). These sites would not be modified in this study. Most of the relatively conserved sites cover about one quarter of the substrate channel, while a few sites are located close to the catalytic center. We analyzed the possible impact from the mutation of the relatively conserved sites near the catalytic center and all the variation sites. By analysis of the key influence factors including properties of amino acids, hydrogen bonding, electron distribution, and charge properties, 5 sites were selected as potential mutation sites for improving Dke1 activity (Table 1 ). For The definitely conserved sites are labeled in red, the relatively conserved sites are labeled in yellow, the variable sites are labeled in green and the selected sites for mutation are marked with red star example, the carbonyl oxygen of A60 was interacted with H62 by forming a hydrogen bond [22] , and it will transfer electrons to H62 after mutated to D60 or N60 which might be helpful to enhance the catalytic activity. Then, 10 mutants were constructed and compared with Dke1 wild-type protein. As shown in Fig. 4 , the strain with Dke1 A60D (Q3148) produced 80.2 \u00b1 2.4 mg/L acetylacetone which is 2.5-fold higher than that of the strain Q3030 (p < 0.01).

Interestingly, with the mutation of K15Q, the channel, through which substrates enter the enzyme reactive center, was widened. Furthermore, a neutral residue glutamine is less attractive to negative-charged acetate than lysine which is positive charged. Taken together both factors make it easier for acetate to arrive at the reactive site of Dke1. The residue A60, as a hydrophobic amino acid, is located close to the reactive center and its side chain is oriented toward the interior of the protein. The substitution of alanine by a hydrophilic residue, aspartate, changed the orientation of the side chain at position 60, resulting in a reactive center with increased volume, which may be more conducive for substrate binding. In summary, these changes brought about by the double mutant increased substrate access to the enzyme active site, resulting in enhanced enzyme activity.",

Simultaneously, the sterilized air was switched to high-purity nitrogen for anaerobic environments. Cell growth, residual glucose and acetylacetone accumulation were monitored over the course of the fermentation. As shown in Fig. 6 , the cell mass reached to a maximum 16.8 g DCW/L at 28 h and decreased slightly after 36 h. A small amount of acetylacetone had already been synthesized before induction possibly due to Dke1 basal expression. After induction, acetylacetone rapidly accumulated and reached the Although the yield of acetylacetone from recombinant E. coli in this study was still relatively low, E. coli is a competitive species for industrial applications with short multiplication time, growth with inexpensive carbon sources and amenability to genetic modification [23] . Many strategies can be used for improving the acetylacetone yield in future study, such as metabolic flow regulation [24] and key genes expression level modulation [25] . Previous study has shown that acetylacetone has toxic side effects on the immune system of mammals [26] , various aquatic organisms [27] and microorganisms [28] . The toxicity threshold of acetylacetone is 67 mg/L for Pseudomonas putida [28] , and an excess of acetylacetone (> 1.5 g/L) can completely inhibit the cell growth of A. johnsonii [9] . We speculated that the acetylacetone toxicity might be one of the main reasons for the low yield. The toxicity of acetylacetone to E. coli cells was tested (Additional file 1: Fig.  S4 ). The results showed that 100 mg/L acetylacetone has obvious inhibition effect on the growth of E. coli, and the cell was almost completely inhibited at a concentration of 5 g/L. The mechanism of toxicity, however, has still not been revealed. Further research is needed on the underlying mechanism to guide the metabolic engineering for higher production. Adaptive evolution is also an effective measure to improve the bacterial tolerance and enhance the production [29] . As E. coli naturally produces a mixture of ethanol, hydrogen, organic acids, such as lactic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid under anaerobic conditions [30] , metabolic flow analysis and regulation are necessary to conduct for acetylacetone production enhancement. In addition, as the cultivation conditions play an important role on cell growth, product synthesis, and conversion efficiency, it is also worthy to optimize the medium components, substrate addition strategy, fermentation mode, etc. in future research.",

The production was improved by site-directed mutagenesis of Dke1 and the double mutant (K15Q/A60D) enabled the highest acetylacetone-producing capacity. Finally, 556.3 \u00b1 15.2 mg/L acetylacetone was obtained at 36 h post-induction in fed-batch fermentation under anaerobic condition. This study presents the first intuitive biosynthetic pathway of acetylacetone inspired by its biodegradation, and shows its potential for large-scale production. As reported, Dke1 is not absolutely specific for acetylacetone. Many related \u03b2-dicarbonyl compounds such as 3,5-heptanedione, 2,4-octanedione, 2-acetylcyclohexanone, ethylacetoacetate, etc. can be accepted as substrate by Dke1 [8, 9] . As a consequence, the results of this study also provide a possible biosynthesis method for other \u03b2-dicarbonyl compounds.",
