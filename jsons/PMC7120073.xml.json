When this pattern is symmetrical on either side of the mean (or average) value it is called a \u201cnormal distribution.\u201d Normal distributions have specific mathematical properties; for one, the rarity of certain outcomes can be calculated. In that sense, the bell curve can be used to predict the likeliness of future events. Not all biological events have a normal distribution, but many do [5].",

The doomsday scenario of a crop-duster laying down a cloud of anthrax spores on Manhattan \u2013 an event modeled by inference, if not by name, in a recent journal article \u2013 falls entirely outside the natural history of anthrax spores, human beings and Manhattan [6].

Because size of the dose, duration of exposure, mechanism of transmission, and numerous other variables are unknown and unnatural, physicians and public health officials can not easily estimate an individual\u2019s risk during a bioterror event. In particular, it is difficult to identify occupants of the left-hand tail of a bell curve that depicts exposure to a pathogen. It\u2019s hard to say with confidence who is at very low risk of becoming infected, so that tail tends to be ignored and its occupants mentally swept into the fat part of the curve for safety sake when it comes to decisions about clinical monitoring, prophylactic treatment and other interventions. However, the bell curve that represents the side effects of interventions presents a different story. The existence of the right-hand tail \u2013 occupied by the few people who suffer serious side effects of, say, a vaccination \u2013 is either tolerable or intolerable, depending on the probability of the threat being guarded against. If the threat is high, then people will tolerate side effects (or at least the risk of them). If the threat is low, they will find side effects burdensome or unacceptable. But if the magnitude of the threat is unknown \u2013 is simply \u201cnon-zero\u201d \u2013 then nobody can gauge whether the side effects experienced are worth the protection gained. This was the central conundrum posed by the federal government\u2019s recommendation of smallpox vaccination for certain hospital workers in 2003 [7]. It\u2019s useful for people who determine society\u2019s response to the threat of bioterrorism (or, needless to say, an actual act of it) to explain how the importance of different regions of the bell curve changes depending on circumstances.",

In practical terms, this means that even if the balance of events is well explained, the press is always going to devote more attention to the unusual, the dramatic, the damaging.

Thompson: I don\u2019t\u2014\nQ: Can you check that?\nSec. Thompson: Well, we certainly will be checking all of that and getting information out as it goes in.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, can you explain why he was drinking from a stream: And\u2014(laughter)\u2014should we know that?

Thompson: Just because he was an outdoorsman and there\u2019s a possibility that\u2014there\u2019s all kinds of possibilities.\nQ: Did he contract it that way\u2014Did he contract anthrax by drinking the water?\nSec.

Reporters who asked about the search for the perpetrators were told to contact the FBI, which released prepared statements about the investigation but was otherwise tight lipped. If reporters called to follow up on comments made by Secretary Thompson or to ask about policy issues, they were usually referred to the public affairs office at HHS.

You would have to open the letter. And, indeed, we were told that the letter that was sent to Senator Daschle had to be opened by a scissors because of how well it was sealed.\nSo through this period of time we were still operating on the assumption that in order for a letter to convey this--the anthrax, it had to be either opened by someone who was opening mail, or in some way torn or disrupted in the sorting process, because the concept of a powder in a sealed letter was one that suggested that it would stay in that letter. And that was our epidemiologic experience with the cases we had seen so far. That construct obviously changed markedly with the report of inhalation anthrax in mail workers in the Brentwood facility in Washington where mail was not opened in the places where these individuals were exposed, or seem to have been exposed, and where the disease that they contracted was not cutaneous anthrax, which takes less spores, and is obviously less threatening than inhalational anthrax, and in which the physical characteristics are different. But to get a aerosolization of anthrax requires both air currents flowing around, and some larger quantity of smaller-sized spores to be present, and not easily explained at all by unopened mail. And with that, our current construct on the risk includes, obviously, letters that are unopened as well as letters that are open, that have had, been tampered with or have been maliciously placed in the mail with anthrax spores.

Let\u2019s get back to this issue of cross-contamination versus, you know, prim\u2014whatever we\u2019re gonna call them\u2014primary source criminal letters, or mailings. That where you indicated that there is an inhalation case in the State Department that\u2019s been reported, I think we all think that that would be highly unlikely to virtually impossible to occur, just by cross-contamination, and as well, without having these letters in hand, but based on what we\u2019ve seen in other sites, there are probably multiple mailings that have gone out, and, you know, there may be several places in the federal government that have been deemed targets for these letters to go to.

The National Science Foundation funded a study in which epidemiologists systematically analyzed the public response to 10 disasters that occurred between 1989 and 1994. These included an underground gas explosion in Guadalajara, Mexico, that killed more than 200 people in 1992; the first bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in 1993; and the Northridge earthquake in California in 1994. The findings were revealing. One of the researchers described a few of the more salient ones:Overall, the evidence suggested that victims tend to respond effectively and creatively. What we saw repeatedly in disasters was that victims formed spontaneous groups that have roles, rules, leaders, and a division of labor. This is the phenomenon of emergent collective behavior talked about extensively in the literature on the social science side \u2026  The literature and our study show that panic is relatively rare. There\u2019s a lot of talk about panic, and there\u2019s a general assumption that the public would panic in a bioterrorism event. My question is, where does the data come from to support that? In the events we studied, we were amazed to interview victims and health care workers who commented repeatedly on the absence of panic, complaints, or irrational behavior. Many emergency department workers said, \u201cGee, I wish things worked this smoothly all the time.\u201d Most people talked about an eerie feeling of calm that came over people during life and death moments. Panic happens in disaster movies but typically not in real disasters for reasons that probably are based in evolution.

Nonetheless, West Nile provided a drill of sorts for the challenge public health is now facing. We learned most importantly about the need to address perceptions of risk, to have credible communicators, and to get information out in a timely and consistent way. In the past few weeks, this has meant getting facts out to the public rather than inventing ways to reassure the public. It has also involved acknowledging the seriousness of bioterrorism, but at the same time pointing out that thus far the morbidity and mortality associated with it are far surpassed by preventable illnesses like influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Admitting when we do not yet have the answers has also been required. [41]\n",
