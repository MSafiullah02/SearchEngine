Severe acute respiratory infection symptoms occurred in most patients, with some patients rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure [2]. On January 7, 2020, a novel type of coronavirus was identified from the throat swab sample of a patient, and was temporarily termed as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). On February 11, the pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV was formally named as COVID-19 by WHO [3].",

It indicated that X-ray and computed tomography (CT) examinations were effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of this infectious disease [5]. However, most radiologists and radiological technologists in radiology departments had less experience when facing COVID-19 patients. Examination with nonstandard prevention procedures will lead to high risks of hospital cross-infection in the radiology department. In order to effectively reduce the infection risk of radiologists and radiological technologists, a consensus on \u201cPrevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19\u201d was presented under the endeavors of many radiologists and radiological technologists led by the Chinese Society of Imaging Technology, Chinese Medical Association, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work in the radiology department.",
