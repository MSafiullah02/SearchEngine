Although the presence of Mg 2\u03e9 during the preincubation step did not noticeably influence the recombination frequency ( Figure 2B ), the latter observation suggests that it might have affected the recombination mechanism. (vi) Crossover sites were not evenly distributed along the 3\u0408 fragment sequence.

This crossover site was located at the 5\u0408 base of the helix closest to the 3\u0408 terminus of the 5\u0408 fragment ( Figure 5 ). Although five of these clones were identical and had been isolated from one RNA pool (recombinant A1), the probability that all of them were descendants of a single original recombinant molecule was negligibly low, less than 10 \u03ea6 , as expected from a random distribution of the material contained in at least 100 RNA colonies among the 9 clones isolated from that pool. Moreover, a clone with the same nucleotide sequence had been independently isolated from another RNA pool (recombinant B1), and there were three more clones in which recombination had occurred in a close proximity to this site (recombinants A4, B2, B3).",
