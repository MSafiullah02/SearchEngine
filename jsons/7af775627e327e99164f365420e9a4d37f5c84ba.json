            "text": "The use of saliva collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in the ambulatory setting provides several advantages when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), including ease of self-collection and reduced use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In addition saliva collection could be advantageous in advising if a convalescent patient is able to return to work after a period of self-quarantine. We investigated the utility of saliva collection in the community setting at Renown Health in a prospective Diagnostic Cohort of 88 patients and in a Convalescent Cohort of 24 patients. In the Diagnostic Cohort, we find that saliva collection has reduced sensitivity (~30% less) relative to NPS. And in our convalescent cohort of patients greater than 8 days and less than 21 days from first symptom, we find that saliva has ~ 50% sensitivity relative to NPS. Our results suggest that rigorous studies in the intended populations should be performed before large-scale screening using saliva as the test matrix is initiated. : medRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically detected by performing real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on RNA extracted from samples collected using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), although other sample types, such as oropharyngeal swabs and anterior nares swabs, have also been deemed to be acceptable [3] . Swab-based sample collection, particularly NPS, is typically performed by a healthcare provider, is uncomfortable for the patient, and is risky for healthcare providers, as it frequently induces coughing or sneezing. Recent EUA approvals of saliva-based collection have sparked interest in alternative methodologies for safe and simple sample collection [4, 5] . This study evaluates the performance of saliva specimens in the community setting for initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients who meet CDC criteria for clinical testing (Diagnosis Cohort), and also for patients who previously had a positive clinical NPS-based , 88 patients underwent simultaneous prospective collection of NPS and saliva specimens for diagnostic evaluation for COVID-19. These patients were identified in a community testing environment. None of these patients were admitted to the hospital at the time of testing. NPS samples were sent for testing at the Nevada State Public Health Testing Laboratory, which performed the CDC COVID-19 assay [6] . Saliva samples were sent for testing to Helix, a high complexity CLIA laboratory (CLIA #05D2117342, CAP #9382893). 33 and 55 saliva specimens were collected using Orasure OM-505 Microbiome and OGD-610 DNA collection kits, respectively. With both devices, a proprietary nucleic acid stabilization solution is provided with the collection devices and is added by the patient to their saliva immediately after collection. For the first 60 specimens, patients were randomized to either tube. For the subsequent 28 specimens, only the OGD-610 tube was used, as the OM-505 and OGD-610 tubes appeared to have similar performance characteristics for contrived samples. This study was reviewed and improved by the",

We modified an already implemented Gibbs sampler for [8] latent class models in R and used the following hyperparameters (\u0251,\u03b2) for the Beta priors for prevalence (\u0251=1,\u03b2=4), sensitivity (\u0251=1, \u03b2=1) and specificity (\u0251=2.5, \u03b2=1) to create weak but reasonable priors.",

Concordance in positive and negative results for the TaqPath assay between the two sites, UCSD and Helix, was excellent. There was only one sample, the NPS VTM sample, from Subject 11, which was positive for the TaqPath assay at one site (UCSD) and negative at the other site (Helix). The two assays, TaqPath and PrimerDesign, were discordant for four samples, with the PrimerDesign assay being generally less sensitive: the NPS VTM samples were negative using the PrimerDesign assay and positive for the TaqPath assay for Subjects 13, 18, and 8; and for the NPS VTM sample for Subject 11, the Helix PrimerDesign and TaqPath assays were negative, but the UCSD TaqPath assay was positive.",

Looking at the results from the more sensitive Helix TaqPath assay, both sample types yielded positive results for 4 Subjects, the NPS VTM only was positive for 5 Subjects, and the Saliva only was positive for 1 Subject. As expected, the positive rate decreased for both sample types over time. Of the 15 Subjects who were tested using the Helix TaqPath assay within three weeks of their first symptom, 9 had positive results from the NPS VTM sample and 4 had positive results from the Saliva sample. For the 9 Subjects who were tested more than three weeks after their first symptom, none had a positive result from the NPS VTM and only 1 had a positive result from the Saliva sample. We note that several Subjects had Inconclusive results for one or both samples; this call results from one out of the three viral target sequences yielding a detectable results for the TaqPath assay and may reflect low viral titer; in nearly every case, the positive target was the N gene, which usually yields the lowest Ct value of the three targets.
