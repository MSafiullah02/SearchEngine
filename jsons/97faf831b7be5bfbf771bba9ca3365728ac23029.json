These viruses are known to be the cause of major fatality due to their high mortality and morbidity rates in underdeveloped regions of Africa, Asia, and some parts of Latin America (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . Alphaviruses are able to infect various vertebrates, such as human, horses, rodent, fish, and birds, as well as invertebrates and include numerous categories of viruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Barmah Forest virus, O'Nyong-Nyong virus, Mayaro virus, Rose River virus, Semiliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SINV), Una virus, Tonate virus, Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine viruses (Atkins, 2013) . The infections caused by these viruses are of potential risk, and many of them have so far no treatment. The treatment, management, and vaccination procedure to combat diseases caused by these viruses have not been rewarding (Rayner et al., 2002) . Alphaviruses are generally RNA viruses with a positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA genome (Koonin et al., 1993) . These RNA viruses encode nonstructural (NS) proteins (NSPs) that can be used for replication to achieve a maturation state. These protein moieties can be targeted for the development and testing of potential antiviral drugs. The goal of computational study is to provide an alternative tool that is highly reliable and that may be complementary to the current experimental techniques. The two important theoretical approaches, molecular dynamics simulations Chowdhuri, 2011, 2012) and docking (Agarwal et al., 2015; Bissoyi et al., 2013) , have been found to be quite reliable in this respect.

Acidic pH at the endosomal membrane enables fusion and results in the release of NC into the cytoplasm. Upon the shifting of CPs to ribosomes, NC becomes uncoated and discharges the 49S RNAs genome into the cytoplasm. These genomic RNAs are translated into the NSPs. The information of negativesense replica of genomic RNA is transcribed by the NSPs. This RNA works as an archetype for the production of genomic and subgenomic RNA. The subgenomic RNA has greater capability to synthesize proteins, in comparison to the genomic RNA that also encodes the basic proteins of the virus. In the structural polyprotein, CP being at the N-terminus followed by PE2 (E3\u00feE2), 6K, and E1. Alphavirus virions are formed by the assembly of 240 copies of CP, E2, and E1 ( Fig. 4.1A) . The transmembrane E1 glycoprotein mediates the coalescence between viral and endosomal membranes. On the other hand, the transmembrane segment E2 is responsible for the binding of the cell receptor. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus process the E1 and PE2, a precursor of E2 and E3 as a heterodimer, and transport them in the form of spikes to the cell surface. These spikes are constituted of three heterodimers of E1/E2 that promotes the correct folding of E2 and E3 which work as a chaperone and prevent the premature fusion of E1 with Golgi in an acidic pH environment. During virus entry, fusion of the glycoprotein spike complex produces E2 and E3 by cleavage of PE2 in the Golgi, with the help of a protease similar to furin. The function of 6K is not clear, but it promotes the pathogenic effect of the particle. In the infected cell, an icosahedral NC is formed in the cytoplasm by the encasing of the only copy of genome RNA with 240 copies of CP.

The outer protein layer of these viruses consists of glycoproteins E1 and E2 ( Fig. 4.1) . Membrane extension of these glycoproteins can pass through the lipid bilayer of the host that encloses the NC of the virus. After interaction of the CP and glycoprotein layers, they are proportionally organized in icosahedral configuration of T \u00bc 4. A pseudoatomic model of the virus is generated when the amino acid sequence of CP from 106 to 264 and the crystal arrangements of a part of E1 protein extend into the extracellular space and fit in to the cryo-EM density of the SINV. It has been observed that on the exterior surface of the viral membrane, E1 takes the icosahedral shell shape after binding with cryo-EM density. Practically, the position of E1 and E2 is lateral and radial to the lipid bilayer simultaneously. The top of E1 is populated with the E2, which cloaks the fusion of the peptide to prevent early synthesis with cell membranes. These envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are required for cell entry, during which the exterior of E2 is unveiled, which approaches the cellular receptor and protects E1 until the fusion is completed. The E1 and E2 are separated in the endosome at low pH and the fusion of peptide is exposed. The binding of amino acids (106-264) of CP in cryo-EM density of SINV is exhibited in every single subunit of the prominent pentamers, as well as in hexamers (known as capsomeres), and detected in the NC layer made from the CP protease domain comprising of amino acids. Indeed a minor contact has been observed for CP amino acids 114-264 in capsomere(s). Accordingly, NC is stabilized in the absence of glycoproteins by the RNA-RNA and CP-RNA interactions.

In addition, these NSPs also play a vital role in the infection and interaction of the virus with host cells. Out of the four NSPs, NSP1 (537 aa), whose structure is shown in Fig. 4 .2, binds with membrane proteins and activates guanylyl transferase and methyl transferase, which are involved in the covering of 26S and 42S RNAs (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995; K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen and Ahola, 2002; Koonin et al., 1993; Laakkonen et al., 1994) . In the response of Alphavirus capping, the methyl group is transferred by NSP1 from S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) to GTP. Subsequently, before transferring 7-methyl-GMP (m7GMP) to virus RNA, a covalent complex is formed between m7GMP and NSP1. The response of capping of Alphavirus is somewhat different from the capping of the cellular mRNAs, where guanylyl transferase is first transmitted from GMP to RNA, followed by methylation of GMP-RNA (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995) . The enzymatic actions of NSP1 are necessary for virus replication. A virus becomes noninfectious by single-point mutation because this transformation abolishes the enzymatic activities (Wang et al., 1996) . NSP1 is strongly bound with the plasma membrane of infected cells, and when NSP1 is expressed alone then it functions as a single membrane anchor in virus replication complexes (Per\u00e4nen et al., 1995; Salonen et al., 2003; \u017dusinaite et al., 2007) . Amphipathic alpha-helix is formed when amino acid 245-264 of NSP1 mediates the binding of plasma membrane (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995; \u017dusinaite et al., 2007) . The binding activities of NSP1 with the membrane can be affected by a single-point mutation and it is lethal for the virus (\u017dusinaite et al., 2007) . In SFV, the Cys 418-420 residues of NSP1 and in SINV, Cys420 of NSP1 tighten the membrane binding by posttranslational palmitoylation (Laakkonen et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1996; \u017dusinaite et al., 2007) . Palmitoylation is required only for the formation of the replication complexes or sustainability of the virus, and not for enzymatic activities of NSP1 (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995; \u017dusinaite et al., 2007) . However, removal or exchange of cysteine residues 418-420 in NSP1 of SFV significantly obstructs virus duplication and causes growth of expletive alterations (\u017dusinaite et al., 2007) . It has been observed from the virus expression that palmitoylation-deficient NSP1 is not capable of causing the disease in mice; these viruses induce low levels of viruses in the blood stream, but no infection has been observed in the brain tissues (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995) . NSP1 is responsible for the initiation of structure on the cell surface, similar to filopodia that is representative of Alphavirus-septic cells (Hardy and Strauss, 1989; Laakkonen et al., 1998; Rikkomen, 1996; \u017dusinaite et al., 2007) .

The minimum core for catalytic specific (nucleoside) inhibitors was found to be four hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs), seven hydrogen-bond acceptors (HBAs), and one aromatic ring (R). The minimum core for nonnucleoside inhibitors related to palm allosteric site was found to be one HBD, four HBAs, two Rs, and three hydrophobic regions. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog (inhibitor), interacted with the catalytic site with significant binding energy. Nonnucleoside inhibitors, such as BILN 2061, and diketo acid derivatives, showed better interactions with the palm and thumb allosteric sites, respectively. The selective antiviral activity of favipiravir on the replication of CHIKV, alphaviruses, and favipiravir-resistant CHIKV variants, which all carry a K291R mutation in the RdRp NSP4, were studied by Delang et al. (2014) . These authors also studied the effect of T-705 (favipiravir), a nucleotide prodrug that was developed for the treatment of influenza, on NSP4. The characterization of these virus variants in cell culture suggested that a highly conserved part of the viral polymerase of positive-strand RNA viruses is the target of favipiravir. The NSP2 (K49R and E622G) and NSP3 (Opal524W) mutations, which were also found in favipiravir-resistant CHIKV variants, did not result in phenotypic resistance to favipiravir, shown by reverse genetics. The lysine at position 291, which is located in a region of NSP4, possesses a high degree of conservation among alphaviruses. The structure of favipiravir (38, Fig. 4 .18) bound in the active site of the Norwalk virus (NWV) polymerase structure was found to be superimposed over the cytosine base of CTP. Compared to original Lys291, the charged arginine side chain is much closer to the favipiravir-RTP inhibitor. No such specific interaction or any steric repulsion is observed between K291R and favipiravir-RTP or between Lys291 and favipiravir-RTP. T-705 and its active metabolite T-705 ribofuranosyl triphosphate (39, Fig. 4 .18) have shown binding affinity for NSP4 protease domain.

The available vaccines and therapeutic strategies to combat viruses are very limited, which include viral polymerase inhibitors, recombinant interferons, and boosting host antiviral system. Recently, protease inhibitors were successfully developed to inhibit and manage hepatitis C and HIV viruses. In the present chapter, it has been shown that NSP2 from CHIKV can be effectively targeted by chemicals, that interact with numerous cellular proteins to control interferon signaling and gene transcription. Various forms of scaffold and chemical entities have already been considered for enhancing their capacity as drug molecules targeting NSPs. The crystallographic structures and functions of viral key proteins provide necessary information to develop potential targeted inhibitors against these viral proteins. These developed protease inhibitors ultimately combat diseases arising from different viruses, such as Mayaro virus, Ross River virus, CHIV, SINV, O'Nyong-Nyong virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Semliki Forest virus, Una virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Tonate virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, etc. Although significant improvement has been made in the direction of discovering novel protease inhibitors targeting viral NSP, the lack of clinically approved drug molecules is a limitation for protection against sudden disease occurrence. This chapter is equipped with useful information for developing chemical libraries to design Alphavirus-targeting inhibitors, and to construct pharmacophores for ligand-based drug design. This will increase the chances of discovery for small-molecule inhibitors. In conclusion, in near future NSP inhibitor-based discovery of antiviral drugs need to be considered by both private and public organizations. Hopefully, with the grooming of businessfriendly sectors, discovery of effective drugs based on NSP inhibitors would be a reality.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Molecular modeling and docking study to elucidate novel Chikungunya virus nsP2 protease inhibitors", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Agarwal", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Asthana", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Bissoyi", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Indian J.
