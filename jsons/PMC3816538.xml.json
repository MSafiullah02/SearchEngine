Results were converted to copy number by plotting the C\nt value on a standard curve using serial dilutions of a control plasmid of known concentration. Viral copy numbers were expressed both as copies per mL of sample and copies per cell. Viral copy numbers were normalized to human cells in the specimen using the C-Reactive Protein (CRP) gene copy number. The number of cells present in the sample were calculated from the value of 106\n CRP copies per 500 ng of DNA, determined using the standard curve method described above.

In addition, there was a higher prevalence of KIPyV in hematopoetic stem cell transplant patients compared with other immunocompromised patients. There was no difference in viral load between inpatients and outpatients for each group, but due to high co-infection rates with other respiratory viruses, it is difficult to conclude whether the viral load measurement is correlated with the severity of illness.

The clinical characteristics of HSCT patients who tested positive were not significantly different from the other groups, and require further study with larger study numbers. Another study by Venter et al. reported that of 300 respiratory tract specimens tested, 9/21 (57%) of patients with WUPyV and 1/3 (33%) of those with KIPyV were HIV positive, but these results were not statistically significant, and HIV status was unknown in 47.8% of cases.8 Our population did not include HIV positive patients, but this group deserves further study.",

However, our study is the first to measure the viral loads of WUPyV and KIPyV in respiratory secretions, in an attempt to differentiate their pathology in immunologically distinct patient populations. Viral loads were measured as copies per mL as well as copies per cell, in order to account for the high degree of variability in viral load among respiratory samples depending on sample collection methods and sites of collection. The lack of viral detection in sequential specimens may reflect this non-standardized collection of specimens, rather than a lack of viral persistence, and is one limitation of the study. Inclusion of samples from different sites of the respiratory tract likely contributed to the variability in viral load, but ensured a wider spectrum of disease presentations, given that more ill patients are more likely to have bronchoalveolar lavages and tracheal aspirates.",

Greer et al. reported that rhinovirus detection resulted in a decreased likelihood of detecting adenovirus, coronaviruses, influenza A, bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, RSV, parainfluenza and KIPyV (hypothesizing that there is a triggering of interferon-related genes inducing an antiviral state).12 Such an association was not observed in our study, as infection with enterovirus/rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen associated with infection with KIPyV and WUPyV in both groups. Luminex testing was not performed on all specimens, so the statistical significance of these findings could not be determined.",
