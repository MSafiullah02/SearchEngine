            "text": "The COVID-19 disease was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, having since spread rapidly across the world. The infection and mortality rates of the disease have forced governments to implement a wave of public health measures. Depending on the context, these range from the implementation of simple hygienic rules to measures such as social distancing or lockdowns that cause major disruptions in citizens\u2019 daily lives. The success of these crucial public health measures rests on the public's willingness to comply. However, individual differences in following the official public health recommendations for stopping the spread of COVID-19 have not yet to our knowledge been assessed. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of implementing public health recommendations that aim to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate these associations in the context of France, one of the countries that has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and which ended up under a nationwide lockdown on March 17. In the next sections we describe our theoretical expectations over the associations between sociodemographics, personality, ideology, and emotions with abiding by the COVID-19 public health measures. We then test these hypotheses using data from the French Election Study.",

Given that older individuals are at greater risk of dying from the disease, self-interest suggests that age will be positively associated with personally implementing measures to stop the spread of the virus. At the same time, some of the health measures reduce social interactions, which are more frequent among the young. Consequently, we anticipate that age will be positively associated with complying with the COVID-19 measures (H1).",

            "text": "We are also interested in considering the role of personality in public compliance with the measures. To this end we employ the Big Five personality framework (McCrae and John, 1992). The model argues that individual differences in personality can be summarized in five dimensions, namely openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We believe that at least three of the five personality dimensions should be associated with compliance: conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism. Conscientious individuals tend to be duty-bound and have a high sense of obligation. Therefore, we anticipate that individuals scoring high in conscientiousness will be more likely to abide with the public health measures (H2). On the other hand, we expect that extraversion should be negatively associated with implementing public health recommendations (H3). Extroverted individuals should find it harder compared to introverted individuals to comply with isolating measures that disrupt sociability. Finally, we hypothesize that neuroticism should be positively associated with compliance (H4). This is because individuals scoring high in neuroticism tend to be more sensitive to threat and more risk-averse compared to the emotionally stable.",

A large stream of research in social and political psychology has shown that experiencing fear toward a threatening stimulus is associated with behavioural and attitudinal change (Marcus et al., 2000). Moreover, fear and anxiety render individuals more likely to opt for risk-aversive behavioural strategies (Lerner and Keltner, 2001) and to show increased compliance with authority (Vasilopoulos et al., 2018). These findings lead us to hypothesize that experiencing fear in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic should be positively associated with complying with the public health measures (H6).",

We presented to them a range of different behaviours recommended by the French public health authorities. These included \u201cWashing your hands more often and/or longer\u201d; \u201cCoughing or sneezing into your elbow or a handkerchief\u201d; \u201cStopping greeting by shaking hands or kissing\u201d; \u201cKeeping a distance of one meter from other people outside your home\u201d; \u201cHaving reduced your trips\u201d; \u201cAvoiding crowded places\u201d; and \u201cHaving stopped meeting your friends.\u201d The scale had high reliability (\u03b1 = 0.89), and a factor analysis showed that all items loaded on one factor.

Regarding the psychological characteristics, we include individual differences in the Big Five personality traits using the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al. 2003) administered in September 2016 (Wave 6). The prior measurement of the personality items mitigates concern about priming and reverse causality. Furthermore, we included a measure of ideological self-placement, using an item that asks respondents to place themselves on a scale that ranges from 0 (\u201cLeft\u201d) to 10 (\u201cRight\u201d). As we expect the association of ideology with compliance to be nonlinear, we also included the squared term of ideology. Moreover, we have included two items measuring trust toward the President and scientists. These have been measured using a four-point scale that ranges from 1 (not trust at all) to 4 (trust very much) which were subsequently recoded into dummy variables indicating trust and non-trust.",

Further, women are more likely to have changed their behaviour compared to men. However, we find that education is not associated with public compliance. Further, our findings indicate that conscientiousness is positively associated with having changed behaviour in line with the recommendations. This is in line with H2. Moreover, and confirming our expectations (H3), extraversion is negatively associated with having changed one's daily behaviours in the light of the pandemic. Finally and unexpectedly, neuroticism has a negative association when emotions are taken into account (Model 4). This finding could be attributed to the tendency of neurotic individuals to appraise that their capacity for coping with a threatening stimulus is low, which may lead to inaction (Penley and Tomaka, 2002).",

However, enforcement is costly, and compliance by citizens cannot be taken for granted. Drawing on individual panel data, we find that some basic sociodemographic characteristic as well as personality traits are relevant predictors of compliance with these measures in France. A potential limitation of the results is that possible social desirability tendencies by a part of the respondents may overstate the true extent of compliance. In addition, compliance may have increased in the weeks after the survey was administered given the increase in COVID-19 cases. Overall, our results provide insight into the individual foundations of compliance in the times of COVID-19 that can provide the basis for policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of their measures as well as for future research on the topic.",
