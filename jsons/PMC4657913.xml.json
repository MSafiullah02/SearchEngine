            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is the causative agent of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), which is characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high mortality [1]. After its initial identification in China in 1984 [2], RHD outbreaks have subsequently been reported in other Asian countries [3], Europe [4], Mexico [5], and other countries worldwide [6]. The RHDV belonging to the Caliciviridae family [1, 7, 8] is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The complete genomic sequence of a German isolate of RHDV has been determined and is 7,437 nucleotides (nt) in length [7]. A long open reading frame (ORF) of 2,344 codons (ORF1) and a short ORF of 118 codons (ORF2) have been identified in the genome of RHDV. A nonstructural protein (NSP1-7) and virion coat protein (VP60) were predicted in the C-terminus of ORF1, and a minor structural protein (VP10) was identified in the N-terminus of ORF2 [7, 9]. The 5\u2032 end of the RHDV genome is covalently linked to the viral protein, VPg [10], and a polyadenylated tail was identified at the 3\u2032 end of the RHDV genome, as shown in Fig 1A. Due to the lack of a suitable culture system for RHDV, the mechanism of RHDV translation is largely unknown compared with other RNA viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, avian influenza virus, and poliovirus [11]. However, Goodfellow et al. have significantly improved our understanding of the translation of calicivirus mRNA. Their results demonstrated that caliciviruses use a novel protein-directed translation mechanism in which the interaction between translation initiation factors and VPg plays an important role [12\u201314]. This novel translation mechanism has never been reported in any other animal RNA viruses. While the virus-encoded protein (VPg) is covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of the RHDV genome [10], the biological functions of VPg, especially its role in translation, are not clear. In the present study, we provide evidence that VPg plays an essential role in RHDV translation. Deletion of VPg significantly inhibited RHDV translation, and this effect was restored by trans-supplementation of VPg protein. Additionally, VPg interacted with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and eIF4E silencing significantly inhibited RHDV translation. Our results suggested that VPg serves as a novel \u2018cap substitute\u2019 during the initiation of RHDV mRNA translation.",

The pTVT-RHDV plasmid containing the complete RHDV cDNA and the T7 promoter and ribozyme, was generated in our previous study [17]. The pVPg plasmid, which encodes RHDV VPg, was constructed by inserting the VPg cDNA into a pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) vector (Invitrogen, USA) using KpnI and EcoRI. The VPg cDNA was cloned into the pACT vector (Promega, USA) using XbaI and KpnI to generate the pACT-VPg plasmid.

A pV5-VPg plasmid, which encodes RHDV VPg and a V5 label, was constructed by cloning the VPg cDNA into a pEASY-M1 Expression Vector (Trans Gen Biotech, China). The eIF4E gene was subcloned into the pEASY-M2 Expression Vector (Trans Gen Biotech, China) to generate the pMyc-eIF4E plasmid with a Myc label.

RNase-free water and cDNA from un-transfected RK13 cells were used as blank and negative controls, respectively. False-positive qRT-PCR results caused by primer dimers or nonspecific amplicons were eliminated from the final analysis based on a melting curve analysis of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 95\u00b0C for 15 s. In a preliminary test, the PCR programs were optimized for single bands of the expected sizes of specific genes in a 1% agarose gel. The relative expression level of the Fluc gene compared with the control (pRHDV-luc) was analyzed based on the comparative threshold cycle (CT). Briefly, the Fluc CT value was normalized according to the formula, \u0394C = CT(Fluc)\u2212CT(GAPDH), and the relative expression levels of the genes were determined using the formula, \u0394\u0394CT = \u0394CT(sample) \u2013\u0394CT(control).

            "text": "In general, two mechanisms are involved in translation initiation in positive-strand RNA viruses. The 5\u2032 cap-dependent mechanism contributes to translation initiation in Alphaviruses, Flaviviruses, Coronaviruses, and Arteritis viruses, whereas viruses such as Rhinovirus, Enterovirus Cardiovirus, and Aphthovirus utilize a cap-independent strategy for translation initiation. In the cap-independent strategy, ribosomes bind directly to an internal site of the 5\u2032 non-coding region (NCR) of the viral genome. The 5\u2032 UTR of caliciviruses is significantly shorter than that of other positive-stranded RNA virus genomes. For example, the RHDV 5\u2032 UTR comprises only 9 nt. In addition, there is no cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of Calicivirus genomic RNA. Thus, a novel mechanism is involved in the translation initiation of caliciviruses.",

            "text": "Goodfellow et al. demonstrated that feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV) use a novel protein-directed translation initiation mechanism [13, 14, 27], in which the translation initiation factors interact with VPg. This novel translation initiation mechanism has been discovered in some plant viruses, for example, potyvirus translation initiated by VPg interact with eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) iso 4E (eIF(iso)4E) [28] and turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) translation initiation directed by VPg forms a ternary complex with eIF(iso)4E and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) iso 4G (eIF(iso)4G) [29, 30]. But it has never been reported in other animal RNA viruses. RHDV is one of the most important members of the Lagovirus genera in the Caliciviridae family. The molecular mechanisms underlying RHDV translation and replication are largely unknown due to the lack of suitable tissue culture systems. We recently established an experimental RHDV replicon system [16], in which a Fluc gene is fused in-frame with the viral ORF of the deleted structural genes of the virus. The translation and replication levels of the replicon can be evaluated by detecting a reporter gene. In the present study, to elucidate the role of VPg in RHDV translation, we deleted the coding region of VPg in the replicon. Transfected RK-13 cells revealed that the VPg deletion significantly reduced the expression of the reporter gene, suggesting that VPg was involved in viral translation. The expression level of Fluc was almost completely restored when VPg was trans-supplemented by transfecting the replicon into RK-VPg cells, suggesting that VPg plays an important role in the life cycle of RHDV.",

Interestingly, the interaction between VPg and eIF4E is necessary for translation initiation of FCV mRNA. Therefore, it is likely that VPg interacts with multiple components of the translation initiation factor complex and that not all of these interactions are essential for viral RNA translation. In the present study, we found that RHDV VPg interacted with eIF4E, and both VPg and eIF4E were essential for the translation of RHDV in RK-13 cells. These findings suggest that RHDV VPg also acts as a proteinaceous \u201ccap substitute\u201d to attract ribosomes to the viral mRNA through interactions with the cap-binding protein eIF4E. Further functional studies of VPg and RHDV translation are ongoing to determine whether all of the components of the eIF4F complex are required for the initiation of translation.",
