This method requires a small amount of blood (usually 10 mL) and is rapid (less than 2 weeks to isolate antigen-specific mAbs). Due to the application of antigens as the bait to capture the specific memory B cells, the majority of isolated mAbs are true binders to the antigen, which increases the isolation efficiency. Here, applying this approach, we describe the characterization of mAbs against Zika virus from a convalescent patient sample. From 10 mL whole blood, we sorted 33 Zika envelope (E) protein-interacting single memory B cells. The Ig genes from 15 cells were determined, and 13 mAbs were found that bind to Zika E protein with varied binding affinities.",

However, there are currently no approved antivirals against Zika infection [5] . Administration of polyclonal or purified neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to pregnant mice helps to clear the virus and alleviates the neurological disorders in their fetuses [6, 7] , providing proof of concept that neutralizing mAbs can be used to treat Zika virus infections. Currently, multiple strategies have been reported to generate human neutralizing mAbs against Zika infection, including sequencing antigen-specific memory B cells [8, 9] or generating Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized memory B cells from Zika patient samples [10] , and identifying functional mAbs from phage display na\u00efve antibody libraries [11] . In addition, murine mAbs against Zika virus have also been reported [12] .",

Subsequently, the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes encoded by the sorted cells were determined at the single-cell level. The approach to determine the Ig genes from single cells was first reported by Tiller et al. [13] . Later, Scheid et al. modified this approach to sequence single gp140-binding memory B cells, which were isolated from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients [14] . Then the mAbs against human papillomavirus (HPV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were isolated from immunized or naturally infected human donors, respectively [15, 16] . During the epidemic of Zika virus, we and other groups also applied this strategy to isolate mAbs targeting Zika virus from Zika patients [8, 9] .",

The Ig genes from the sorted cells were determined and cloned into the expression vectors by a reported approach with some modifications [13, 18] . The Ig transcripts in the collected Zika E-interacting memory B cells were first reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Ig gene-specific primer mix at the single-cell level. Then the variable regions for heavy, kappa, and lambda chains were amplified by nested RT-PCR. The first round PCRs were performed with the forward primer mix specific for the leader region and reverse primers specific for the constant regions of heavy, kappa, and lambda chain, respectively. The second round PCRs were performed with the forward primer mix specific for framework segment FR1 and respective nested reverse primers specific for the heavy, kappa, and lambda constant regions. Then the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis and sent for sequencing. In terms of the correct segments, another round of PCR (PCRc) was performed with the forward primer containing the signal peptide of mouse Ig \u03ba and reverse primer paired with the framework segment FR4. Then the resultant PCR segments were overlapped with the respective constant region to get the full expression cassettes for each chain, which were then ligated to the linearized pCAGGS vector.

In addition, MgCl 2 exerts effects on the activities of DNA polymerase (for sing-cell PCR).

However, for Zika E-specific mAbs, we found that some of them displayed relatively low response to the antigens coated on the plate (data not shown here). It is possible that Zika E proteins undergo some conformational changes when adsorbing to the plate, which results in the decreased binding to certain mAbs. In terms of SPR experiments, the mAbs were captured on the chip through interactions with protein A, which binds to the Fc region. Thus, the CDRs of mAbs orient to the buffer flowing over the chip surface. In addition, the Zika E proteins in the buffer of HBS-EP are label-free and more prone to be in its native conformation than those coated on the plate. Thus, we chose SPR assay to detect the interaction between mAbs and antigens. 29. Due to the different binding kinetics between an antigen and its mAb, we set varied dissociation time. For example, mAb Z6 dissociates with Zika E with very low rate; thus we set 600 s for their dissociation. However, for both Z20 and Z23, they are ready to dissociate with the antigen, and 60 s was used for their dissociation (Fig. S2 G, J, and L in the paper [8] ).",
