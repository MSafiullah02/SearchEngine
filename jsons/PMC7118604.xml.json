Characteristics of the five patients are presented in Table 1\n. The age range of patients was 47 to 67 years and two of five patients were female. None of the patients had known exposure to the Huanan seafood market that appeared to be the epicenter of this infection. One had known exposure to an infected family member. The most common symptom of the five infected patients was diarrhea (4/5), followed by fever (3/5), fatigue (3/5) dyspnea (2/5) and abdominal pain (2/5). Only one patient had dry cough. No patients had rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia or other upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. All of the five patients had lymphopenia (<1.0 \u00d710\u2079/L). Only one patient had white blood cell and neutrophil cell count slightly above normal.",

In addition one patient had respiratory symptoms and abnormal CT but negative rRT-PCR. All patients presented with lymphopenia, and the most common chest radiograph abnormality was ground glass opacity, which bears some resemblance to previous reports (9). Of note the prevalence of 2.5% may underestimate the actual prevalence of infected patients. Screening of all MHD patients began after the first patient was identified on Feb. 9, and screening consisted of a chest CT; rRT-PCR testing was only performed in those with an abnormal CT. In addition all patients had temperature measured prior to dialysis and those patients who had temperature exceeding 37.3\u2070 C or with respiratory symptoms had a chest CT and, if abnormal, testing for rRT-PCR. Therefore, some patients may have developed COVID-19 prior to screening and patients without an abnormal CT at the time of screening would have been missed, although no symptomatic patients were identified prior to Feb. 9.",

Because the uremia status is associated with extensive impairment of lymphocyte and granulocyte function, an abnormal immune system may alter their response to SARS-CoV infection(10). This is of particular concern given the densely populated and busy nature of dialysis facilities, creating a high risk of exposure. However, in our dialysis center, it does not seem to have spread widely. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, the city our dialysis center is located, we have taken a number of measures to avoid infection of patients and staff by the SARS-CoV2 virus beginning on Jan. 9. Patients were required to wear surgical masks or N95 masks throughout the hemodialysis treatment. No visitors were allowed. The staff members who conducted the dialysis treatments wore face shields, N95 face masks, eye shields, disposable gowns, caps, and gloves. In addition, chlorine disinfectants were used daily by staff to disinfect items and floors in the dialysis center. The circulating air UV air sterilizer disinfects 4 times a day for 2 hours each time.",
