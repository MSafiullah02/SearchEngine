As demonstrated by the response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza, genomic sequencing has become an important method for diagnosing agents of infectious disease. Despite the value of genomic sequences in characterizing novel pathogens, raw data on their own do not provide the information needed by public health officials and researchers. One must integrate knowledge of the genomes of pathogens with host biology and geography to understand the etiology of epidemics. To these ends, we have created an application called Supramap (http://supramap.osu.edu) to put information on the spread of pathogens and key mutations across time, space and various hosts into a geographic information system (GIS). To build this application, we created a web service for integrated sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis as well as methods to describe the tree, mutations, and host shifts in Keyhole Markup Language (KML). We apply the application to 239 sequences of the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene of recent isolates of avian influenza (H5N1). We map a mutation, glutamic acid to lysine at position 627 in the PB2 protein (E627K), in H5N1 influenza that allows for increased replication of the virus in mammals. We use a statistical test to support the hypothesis of a correlation of E627K mutations with avian-mammalian host shifts but reject the hypothesis that lineages with E627K are moving westward. Data, instructions for use, and visualizations are included as supplemental materials at:",

Using a web browser, a user inputs text files containing sequence and or phenotypic data, latitude and longitude coordinates, and (optionally) a date of isolation for each strain. Our application then executes a workflow that entails integrated sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, computation of character changes (e.g., mutations and host shifts), and geographical projection of the tree on a computing cluster. Once the analyses are complete, the user can download a phylogenetic layer expressed in KML file and view the file with a Geographic Information System (GIS). The user can use the phylogenetic layer to visualize several aspects of pathogen evolution including: spread of lineages, mutations, shifts among hosts, and phenotypic changes over geography and time. We illustrate the use of the system with a case study on H5N1 and discuss use of visualization in conjunction with statistical validation.",

The diagnosis functionality is similar to a user performing character mapping on a traditional cladogram using the ''Trace Character History'' feature in Mesquite or ''Map Characters'' feature in TNT (Goloboff et al., 2008) . In the case of Supramap, character changes are optimized on the projected tree. Thus, Supramap enables character evolution studies in biogeographic and temporal contexts.

RAxML requires the user to upload a precomputed alignment. In contrast, Supramap does not require an alignment (although it can use pre-aligned data if the user prefers).

For example, in the early days of the SARS epidemic, the cases were reported as atypical pneumonia, which often indicates a bacterial agent. Only through serological, microscopic and nucleotide sequence characterization was it understood that SARS was caused by a previously undiscovered coronavirus (CoV) . Furthermore, it was not until the full genome of SARS-CoV was sequenced, shared and compared via phylogenetics to related coronaviruses from a variety of animals that the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV could be put in the evolutionary and geographic context necessary for disease surveillance (Guan et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003; Janies et al., 2008) .",

Statistics include the optimal tree cost found during the search and the number of times this tree cost was hit. If the user prefers, multiple sequence alignment and or tree search can be pre-computed locally with edit costs, search heuristics and optimality criterion specified by the user.

The visualization suggests that H5N1 is mutating at position 627 while it is spreading westward. This is an intriguing hypothesis, but as shown in Janies et al. (2007) , cannot be supported statistically. We highlight this case study because it underscores the point that visualizations should be treated with caution. Although visualization is a great tool for inspiration of hypotheses and communication of ideas, results should be checked for statistical significance. We choose to use the concentrated changes test as it explicitly takes into account the interrelationships of the organisms whereas other methods do not (Grupe et al., 2001) . Felsenstein (1985) argues that due to common ancestry, organisms cannot be treated as statistically independent entities. The interrelationships between organisms can be obtained via phylogenetic analysis and should not be ignored.

However, an important issue in research on emergent infectious diseases is data security. One solution to this problem is that users can run a binary of POY enabled via plug-ins for KML generation on local computers without the use of a remote cluster and without transmission of their data outside of their organization. We include instructions for: the web and stand-alone implementations of Supramap and POY, projection of precomputed trees, and colouring tree branches in KML at this web page: http://supramap. osu.edu/sm/supramap/tutorials.",

In Supramap, we share powerful software tools and computing via an easy-to-use interface. Our overarching goal is to build communities of researchers and public health officials to leverage combined strengths and expertise to fight infectious diseases. Once produced and shared, KML encoded maps can be layered in a GIS. Layering pathogen phylogenies with other data such as host distributions, transit systems and environmental conditions will provide a common analytical framework in which a multidisciplinary team can work to understand the origin and spread of emergent diseases.",
