In present study, the specificity of serum antibodies induced by F69 strain inactivated vaccine was identified by Western blot assay. Two dominant bands and several minor bands were exhibited in the gel after SDS-PAGE. In electrophoresis, the migration of virus proteins was somewhat blocked, the visual effect of which was the arched front (lane 1, Fig. 4). Considering the imbalance in migration rates between protein marker (lane M, Fig. 4) and virus proteins, the actual molecular weight of the two main protein bands should be a little smaller than the apparent values, which was estimated at about 50 and 25 kDa that was equivalent to N and M protein of SARS-CoV, respectively. S protein was not detected; it is likely due to the loss in long-term storage after inactivation and in the sample treatment, or together with the relatively low S protein content [11], [26]. Following the immunochemical reactions with the antiserum, two strong bands exhibited on the membrane (lane 2, Fig. 4) exactly at the corresponding position in the gel, whereas no color bands generated on the membrane with normal serum (lane 4, Fig. 4). A convalescent serum of SARS patient was used, and the same positive result was obtained (lane 3, Fig. 4), which further demonstrated the specificity of the antibodies induced with the inactivated vaccine produced from F69 strain.",

The antiserum collected on D26 from group A (with Freund's adjuvant vaccine) was diluted into two-fold serial dilutions, and incubated with an equal volume of active F69 virus dilution (100 TCID50). After neutralization, each mixture was added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in micro-plates, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C to observe CPE status. These photographs showed the morphologic changes of Vero E6 cells at 72 h after infection. (A) Cell control (no CPE); (B) virus control (infected with active SARS-CoV, 100% CPE); (C) cell morphologic changes infected with the antiserum-neutralized virus mixtures. (C-1 and C-3) Without CPE, at the serum dilution of 1:1024. (C-2 and C-4) About 50% CPE, at the dilution of 1:2048.",
