Based on the phylogeny of the G gene, hMPV is divided into two genotypes (A and B) and further into four subtypes (A1, A2, B1, and B2).3, 28 A novel sublineage A2b was identified in children in Germany in 2006.21\n",

In young adults (aged 14\u201325 years), the clinical symptoms of hMPV infection are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections. In contrast, in middle aged (aged 26\u201365 years) and healthy elderly adults (aged > 65 years), hMPV presents similarly to influenza infections and common colds.13 Although the incidence of hMPV infection in healthy adults during winter is generally less than 6%,5, 23, 30, 42 hMPV is considered to be a major contributor to the burden of respiratory illnesses in older adults.42\n",

A pair of primers targeting the P gene of hMPV was designed to generate an amplicon of 240 bp. Sequences of the forward and reverse primers were: 5\u2032-TYAACATTGCWACAGCAGGACC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTTCWGATTCWCCRCTTGTGCT-3\u2032, corresponding to nt 1834\u20131855 and nt 2052\u20132073 of hMPV gz01 strain (GenBank accession no GQ153651), respectively. RT-PCR was performed using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, a 5 \u03bcl aliquot of the extracted total nucleic acids was used as the template. The RT-PCR assay consisted of initial reverse transcription at 48 \u00b0C for 45 min and pre-amplification at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 35cycles of amplification at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and an additional extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. All PCR products of the expected size were verified by sequence analysis. The hMPV subtypes were identified by alignment of the PCR sequence with the corresponding reference sequences from GenBank database, using BLAST program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi). Other common respiratory viruses in clinical specimens were simultaneously detected using RT-PCR or PCR assays, as described previously,36 including influenza viruses (A, B and C), parainfluenza viruses (type 1\u20134), rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) and respiratory syncytial virus. To avoid potential cross-contamination, master-mix preparation, nucleic acid extraction, assembly of the PCR reaction, and detection of the PCR products were performed in separate areas. Strict controls for nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification were also included.",

Similar annual incidences have been reported in the United States of America,19 the United Kingdom,16 and in Cambodia.4 Although the winter-spring season is traditionally regarded as the typical epidemic season of hMPV in temperate regions,5, 7, 14, 18, 23, 30, 42 the results of our study show that the hMPV epidemic peaked during the winter\u2013spring season (November\u2013February) of 2008\u20132009 and the spring-summer season (March\u2013June) of 2010. The hMPV seasonality observed in this study is comparable to that reported in Japan,31 which showed a biennial rhythm of hMPV seasonality, with the epidemic peaking between November and March in odd years and between March and June in the successive even years.1, 2, 31 Our results indicate that hMPV seasonality in adults is similar to that in children.",

Such genotype replacement is believed to result from adaptive immunity of a population to the predominant circulating genotype.1, 17, 22 In this study, analysis of the incidences of hMPV subtypes shows that hMPV_A (represented by hMPV_A2) was declining whereas hMPV_B (hMPV_B1 and B2) was rising from July 2008 to June 2010. Thus, it is possible that hMPV_A1 was in its troughs during the study period. A longer study period would be required to investigate the prevalence patterns of hMPV subtypes.",
