In the past decades, much consideration focused on the nutrition and reproduction of captive giant pandas, while prevention and control of infectious diseases were ignored. The impact of infectious disease on wildlife populations has been documented in a variety of wildlife species and has highlighted the need to consider infectious disease in conservation plans (Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001).",

For instance, three pandas were infected with CDV, of which two died in Chongqing Zoo, and two pandas died of CDV in Nanjing Zoo (Hu et al., 1997, Huang, 1983). Giant pandas with CPV infection showed diarrhea, vomiting and water-like feces (Wu et al., 1988), and CCV caused acute enteritis of pandas in Fuzhou Zoo in 1987. CDV and CCV strains were also isolated from giant pandas (Li et al., 1999, Hu et al., 2004). Mainka et al. (1994) assayed antibody titers against CDV, CCV, canine herpesvirus (CHV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), and CPV in sera from eight unvaccinated pandas, and detected antibodies against CDV, CCV, CAV-2 and CPV. Loeffler et al. (2007) carried out serologic analysis of 19 giant pandas at Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding (CPB) who were vaccinated with a common dog vaccine, and detected antibodies against CDV, CPV and Toxoplasma that varied among individuals and from year to year in and among individuals.",

For example, most giant pandas at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda (Wolong Research Center, WL) are not vaccinated, while the CPB used live multivalent vaccines (including CDV, CPV, CAV-1, CCV, Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), and rabies virus) for dogs, and the Beijing Zoo (BJZ) used killed CDV vaccine made for dogs. Although no giant panda deaths have been directly attributable to attenuated live virus vaccines in China, the possibility of subclinical disease may be significant. Neonatal infection from a vaccinated dam may result in the giant panda Stunted Development Syndrome (Janssen et al., 2006). Vaccination of cubs with modified live CDV vaccines may contribute to the gastrointestinal and respiratory illness. What's more, the dental abnormalities and enamel erosion that are found in giant pandas may be related to early infection with CDV (Bittegeko et al., 1995, Janssen et al., 2006).",

Sixty-seven samples were from WL; 20 were from CPB and five were from BJZ (Table 1, Table 2\n). Blood samples were collected when pandas were anesthetized for semen collection, artificial insemination or routine physical examination during February to June. Both the CPB and BJZ had vaccinated their pandas 4\u20135 months prior to blood sample collection. Pandas were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (5\u201310 mg/kg body weight; The First Pharmacy Co., Shanghai, China) by staff veterinarians. CPB had vaccinated their giant pandas with a Chinese manufactured multivalent vaccine against CDV, CPV, CAV-1, CCV, canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) and rabies virus for dogs. All but the rabies component of the vaccine were modified live viruses; and the rabies virus was killed with formalin. BJZ had vaccinated with an inactivated CDV vaccine. The strain, dose, and concentration of virus in the vaccines were unknown, or at least unobtainable. One giant panda called Dadi was born in WL, and then transferred to BJZ in October, 2004 and was vaccinated with inactive CDV vaccine. We collected a serum sample from Dadi while he was at WL in April 2004 and then at BJZ in March 2005. Serum samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis.",

Antibody titers against CPV-2 and CPIV were measured by hemagglutination inhibition with the use of porcine red blood cells and chicken red blood cells, respectively, starting with serum dilutions of 1:10. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed according to the method described by Carmichael et al. (1980). Results are reported as the highest dilution at which no hemagglutination was observed.

In this study, 94% of unvaccinated giant pandas had no antibodies against CDV. One explanation may be that the survival rate of infected animals is low and the exposed animals do not exist in the sampled population. CDV is one of the important elements causing diarrhea in giant pandas. Neonates and cubs are prone to diarrhae, which is common in captive giant pandas and is associated with high mortality (Loeffler et al., 2006). Another possible explanation might be that the field virus does not elicit a strong immune response even though it kills the infected animal. The third possibility is that they simply are not exposed to the virus very much.",

Alternative explanations to the viable vaccine titers include inconsistent delivery of the vaccine or variability in response of the giant panda individual to antigens.
