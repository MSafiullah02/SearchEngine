Furth er alignment of seven conserved nonstructural viral proteins confirmed that the novel cor onavirus belongs to SARSr-CoV, the same genus of severe acute respiratory syndrome co ronavirus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, researchers have identified that the novel coronavirus enters cells via the same mechanism as SARS-CoV, by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor on the cell surface [1] . On January 24, the National Institute f or Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion, officially published the information on the first novel coronavirus strain, including s train type, electron micrographs, and sequences of primers and probes for detection of its nucleic acid by RT-PCR. On January 25, Chinese researchers published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine and formally identify the novel coronavirus as the seve nth member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans [2] . On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) held an official meeting and decided that the novel coronavi rus outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. On February 12, the I nternational Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and WHO officially named the novel co ronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.",

The results showed that ACE2 is expressed in many tissues, including heart, esophagus, ileum, kidneys, and bladder, at a level that is even higher tha n that in the alveolar cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may affect many systems [3] .

ACE2, also known as ACEH, is a member of the angiotens in-converting enzyme (ACE) family of dipeptidyl-carboxydipeptidase and is highly homo logous to ACE1. ACE1 and ACE2 convert angiotensin 1 into angiotensin (Ang) 1-9 and a ngiotensin 2 into Ang 1-7. ACE2 has high affinity to Ang II type 1 and type 2 receptors a nd plays an important role in many physiological functions, such as cell proliferation and hypertrophy, inflammatory response, blood pressure, and fluid balance. ACE2 is specifica lly expressed in certain organs and tissues, suggesting that it plays an important role in re gulating cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive functions [9, 10] In another study, the ACE2 protein level was determined in human organs and tissues, including respiratory mucosa, lung, stomach, sm all intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and b rain. The results showed that ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the lungs and small intesti ne and is highly expressed in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of virtually all or gans. Therefore, once in the circulatory system, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to spread via blood fl ow [11] . These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the respiratory system but is also a potential threat to the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulat ory system. s that could bind to the entry receptor ACE2.

Lan and Cai performed RNA sequencing and found high, specific ACE2 ex pression in bile duct cells, suggesting that it is important to monitor liver function of SAR S-CoV-2 patients, especially liver indicators involving bile duct function. In case of liver d ysfunction, targeted treatment and care should be given in a timely manner [15] . and complement activation [16] .

The results showed that 19% of the patients had el evated serum creatinine, 27% had elevated urea nitrogen, and 63% had urine protein (+ to ++). Kidney CT was abnormal in all the patients [17] . In addition, three separate clinical st udies in six, 41, and 99 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively, showed that b esides severe respiratory dysfunction, 3% to 10% of the patients had renal insufficiency, and 7% had acute kidney injury [18] .

These data indicate that the incidence of ki dney dysfunction is high after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The bladder may also be affected an d may ultimately lead to multiple-organ failure and death. ACE2 mRNA and protein levels are higher in testis than in any other organ. The research ers surmise that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to affect the kidneys and testis and subsequ ently causes their dysfunction [18] . Wang et al found that ACE2 was predominantly enriche d in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) i ndicated that Gene Ontology (GO) categories associated with viral reproduction and trans mission were highly expressed in ACE2-positive spermatogonia, but terms which related to male gamete generation showed significantly low expression [19] . Both viral infection an d antiviral therapy have potential nephrotoxicity and may cause kidney injury. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 patients should be closely monitored for fluid and electrolyte disturbance a nd kidney function and receive specific targeted treatment and care as needed. Patients wi th chronic renal insufficiency should undergo hemodialysis or renal replacement therapy i f necessary to facilitate metabolic waste removal. In addition, the virus may affect testicu lar tissue, and clinicians should assess the risk of testicular lesions in younger patients du ring the hospital treatment and follow-up and provide prompt prevention and treatment fo r potential SARS-CoV-2-related reproductive injury. [20] SARS-CoV-2 may infect the central nervous system(CNS), as the viral nucleic acid has b een detected in patient's cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue from autopsy. As for the route of virus entering the CNS, the blood route still needs to be further verified due to the existence o f blood-brain barrier. But on the other hand, neuronal pathway is important vehicles for neurotro pic viruses to enter the CNS. Viruses can migrate after infecting sensory or motor nerve endings.",

Meanwhile, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is one of the most classical inflammation markers, as well as levels of cytokines linked to cardiovascular risk, are also related to adverse outcomes and could be some potential biomarkers to assess the diseas e progression [27, 28] . Since the recent outbreak, cytokine cascades have been observed in many severe SARS-C oV-2 cases [25, 29] . Figure 2 shows the mechanism of cytokine cascade, also known as an infl ammatory cascade. Pathogen infection triggers an intense immune response and inflamma tory response and rapid release of a large amount of cytokines (such as tumor necrosis fac tor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) ). In this context, patients with vir al infection are particularly susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multipl e-organ failure. Cytokine cascades and low lymphocytes are also specific in other severe coronavirus diseases (such as SARS and MERS) and are positively related to disease prog ression and severity [30] [31] [32] .

Based on cur rent data, the mortality rate is higher in patients aged 60 or above and in patients with un derlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. At present, a lthough epidemic prevention and control efforts have achieved remarkable results in China, SAR S-CoV-2 is emerging as a pandemic world-wide. In addition, although Wuhan was the \"place of discovery\" of SARS-CoV-2, it was probably not the \"place of origin\". Many recent studies have shown that there are many possibilities for the origin of this virus [37] [38] [39] . Moreover, gene sequence analysis has proved that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in some countries had no history of exposure to Wuhan, and the relevant virus had no homology, with significant differences [40, 41] . S ARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, and we are still trying to understand how it spreads a nd causes disease, which makes it more challenging to prevent and control the epidemic [42, rus affects many other systems in humans as well. This complicates potential clinical man ifestations and makes it harder to treat such cases [45, 46] . However, with a deeper understand ing of this virus from biomedical research and epidemiological observation, researchers will know more about how SARS-CoV-2 damages the respiratory system, circulatory syst em, digestive system, urogenital system, and central nervous system in the near future, w hich will provide important clues to etiologic research, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, t reatment, and prognostic assessment. When developing the treatment plan for SARS-CoV -2 patients, it is important to perform a comprehensive assessment of vital organ function and provide symptomatic treatment. Specifically, patients should be monitored for liver a nd kidney function and receive supportive care as needed, in order to reduce the risk of in flammatory cascade and improve overall treatment outcomes. In addition, it is important t o investigate the structural and functional variation and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 to inves tigate its molecular mechanisms in different organs and look for potential targets or recep tors in order to aid in the development of vaccines and screens of antiviral drugs. Table 1 lists some traits of known coronaviruses as a reference for researchers. The homology of S ARS-CoV-2 and the common poultry coronavirus genome is 40.3 % ~ 51.7 %, and that of the c ommon poultry \u03b2-coronavirus genome is 49.5 % ~ 51.7 %, indicating that the homology of com mon poultry coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is less than 52%, showing a distant relationship. The results of S protein analysis showed that the homology of S-protein gene sequence of SARS-Co V-2 and common poultry coronavirus was 37.1% ~ 46.2%, and the homology of S-protein amino acid sequence was very low, less than 31% [47] [48] [49] . In addition, since the genomic homology betwe en SARS-CoV-2 and poultry coronavirus is only about 50%, it can be considered that cross-spe cies infection is difficult to achieve. Overall, in terms of susceptibility, except for the seven coro naviruses that can infect humans, poultry or other host-related coronaviruses appear to be less su sceptible to human disease in the present study [50, 51] .",
