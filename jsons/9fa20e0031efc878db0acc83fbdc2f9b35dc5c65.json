An infected person's lungs are the organs most affected because the virus accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on type II alveolar cells. The virus uses a surface glycoprotein, called a 'spike' (peplomer), to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell [4] . Thus, respiratory manifestations such as cough, sputum production and shortness of breath remain the most common symptoms, following fever [5] . In addition, upper airway manifestations, including nasal congestion and sore throat, are observed in patients exhibiting mild disease. Furthermore, respiratory tract specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal, nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) are the most common clinical specimens obtained for real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 [6] . Based on a preliminary understanding of COVID-19, patients with fever or airway symptoms and characteristic travel, occupation, contact or cluster histories were initially screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] . However (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ).",

In a series of 138 hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China, arrhythmia, shock and acute cardiac injury were observed in 16 [11] . In addition, acute myocarditis and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported rarely [12] [13] [14] . Most importantly, patients with COIVD-19 and cardiac injuries more frequently require mechanical ventilation and demonstrate a higher mortality rate than those without cardiac injuries [9] . In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause acute cardiac injuries, chest pain and arrhythmic complications; cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19 may be associated with poor outcomes.",

In addition, many reports show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal specimens [18, 19] as well as in oesophageal, stomach, duodenal and rectal samples [20] . A recent meta-analysis including 4234 COVID-19 patients from 60 studies reporting gastrointestinal symptoms showed that the prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.3-24.5%] and that severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms than non-severe cases (17.1% vs. 11.8%) [21] . The pooled prevalence of anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain/discomfort were 26.8% (95% CI 16.2-40.8%), 12.5% (95% CI 9.6-16.0%), 10.2% (95% CI 6.6-15.3%) and 9.2% (95% CI 5.7-14.5%), respectively [21] . Moreover, the pooled prevalence of stool specimens that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 48.1% (95% CI 38.3-57.9%), including 70.3% (95% CI 49.6-85.1%) of specimens collected after returning negative respiratory specimen results [21] . In addition, the duration of SAR-CoV-2 RNA detection in stool specimens from patients treated with steroids (20 days) was significantly longer than that for those not receiving steroids (11 days) (P < 0.001) [22] . Based on these findings, clinicians should be cognisant of the common ",

Apart from ACE2, COVID-19-associated nervous system damage may also be caused by direct infection injury, hypoxic injury and immune responses [32] . A retrospective clinical study of 214 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported that 78 patients (36.4%) had neurological manifestations, including 53 (24.8%) with central nervous system (CNS) injuries, 19 (8.9%) with peripheral nervous system (PNS) injuries and 23 (10.7%) with skeletal muscle injuries [33] . Dizziness (36 patients; 16.8%) and headache (28 patients; 13.1%) were the most commonly reported CNS symptoms; impairments of taste (12 patients; 5.6%) and smell (11 patients; 5.1%) were the most common PNS symptoms [33] . In addition, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, seizures, vision impairment and nerve pain were reported in <10% of patients. Except for stroke and impaired consciousness, which developed within a median post-admission period of 8-10 days, most neurological manifestations occurred within a median period of 1-2 post-admission days. Moreover, neurological manifestations were more common in patients with severe COVID-19 infection than in those with non-severe disease (45.5% vs. 30.2%; P = 0.02); patients with severe disease were also more likely to have impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease and skeletal muscle injuries than those with non-severe infection. In addition, one case of meningoencephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in a patient with an initial neurological presentation of convulsions and unconsciousness in Japan [34] . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed hyperintensity along the right lateral ventricle wall and hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, indicating meningitis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) [34] . Similarly, another case of COVID-19-associated encephalitis was reported in a male from Wuhan, China [35] . In Italy, Toscano et al. reported that five cases developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome 5-10 days after the onset of COVID-19",

Chen et al. reported a 30-year-old man who developed red eyes, tearing and foreign-body sensations (diagnosed as bilateral acute conjunctivitis) 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 [44] . Slit lamp examination demonstrated bilateral moderate conjunctival injection, water discharge and inferior palpebral conjunctival follicles. RT-qPCR assay of a conjunctival swab detected the presence of viral RNA, but routine bacterial and fungal culture results were negative. In addition to umifenovir and lopinavir/ritonavir, topical ribavirin eye drops were prescribed four times daily. On Day 19, the patient's ocular symptoms resolved and a repeated slit lamp examination showed improvements; the results of a follow-up conjunctival swab were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Another series showed that 12 (31.6%) of 38 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrated ocular manifestations, including conjunctiva hyperaemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions that were indicative of acute conjunctivitis [45] . However, conjunctival specimens and nasopharyngeal swabs for only two patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [45] . Moreover, four, two and six cases were classified as moderate, severe and critical novel coronavirus pneumonias, respectively. These preliminary data should remind clinicians of the potential for a rare ocular complication (acute conjunctivitis) in patients with COVID-19.

Table 2 lists the common adverse effects of commonly used agents for the treatment of COVID-19. Among them, an abnormality of hepatic function (23%) has been reported mostly for remdesivir, whereas no major adverse effects have been reported for favipiravir (both are RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors) [62] [63] [64] [65] . In contrast, the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir exerts adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract, such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, as well as leading to asthenia, abnormal hepatic function, hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia [66] . The potential for inducing ventricular dysrhythmia after QTc prolongation should be cautiously monitored for hydroxychloroquine, which alkalises the pH in the early endosomal pathway of SARS-CoV-2 entry [67] . Teicoplanin, which inhibits cathepsin L/B enzymes in the late endosomal pathway of SARS-CoV-2 entry, is actually an antibiotic agent active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [62] . Its dosage should be prescribed according to body weight and creatinine clearance rate [68] . In addition, tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody originally prescribed in the treatment of acute exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, has been suggested to be used in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the cytokine storm stage of COVID-19 [62, 69] . However, this drug likely induces strong immunosuppression. Finally, depression, ataxia, psychosis and seizures induced by ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2, need to be monitored [70, 71] .",

The results further suggest that screening for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with olfactory and taste manifestations should be considered during the pandemic.",
