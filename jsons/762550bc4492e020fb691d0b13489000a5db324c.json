Strictly speaking, social distancing refers to physically distancing by 1-2 meters, but the overall concept is more important: disrupting the infectious chain by separating those with the disease from those without 1 . Epidemiologists have espoused the term, believing in its ability to 'flatten the curve.' By reducing the exponential rise in cases, the healthcare system is not overwhelmed and can function sustainably over the long term 1 . While this concept's main intention is to control disease, in the hospital setting, it provides the equally important added benefit of ensuring continuity of vital services should intra-hospital transmission occur 2 . We are part of a 1700-bed hospital, with a radiological service strength of over 600 (41 residents, 77 attendings (nuclear medicine, interventional, diagnostic), 273 radiographers, 240 nurses and administrative support staff). This manuscript describes our measures and early experiences with safe distancing in our Radiology service.",

Each subunit was designed to function independently and carry on the needs of the service even if a substantial proportion of staff were unable to work. We utilized both physical and temporal measures to segregate the teams, with minimal cross over both during work and after hours. Our diagnostic radiology manpower explored the use of home tele-radiology, but due to infrastructure limitations, we were unable to do this on a large scale. Instead, we split into 3 mixed sub-specialty functional subunits, comprising a combination of trainees and attendings specializing in body, musculoskeletal, and neuroradiology; 1 team was physically located in the inpatient area while 2 teams were located in outpatient areas. Case distribution was independent of team location.",

We chose 3, because in the event that our trainee manpower was diverted to areas of greater need, the attending staff could still sustainably provide 24/7 radiology coverage. Temporal segregation was also utilized in the form of a 15 minute time gap between shifts. For example, the day team would cease work at 545pm and an on-call team would arrive at 6 pm.",

Besides encouraging teams to eat only within their functional subunits, we moved tables at least 1 meter apart from each other, with placards on tables reminding diners not to dwell and to keep conversation to a minimum. Lunch hours amongst our teams are now staggered. Because prolonged contact time with COVID-19 persons is likely correlated with an increased risk of infection, and to facilitate staggering of meal times, we have encouraged diners to limit their mealtimes to 30 minutes. We opened up additional dining areas to minimize staff congestion. Public shuttle buses from the hospital to a local food market have been indefinitely postponed, to minimize the opportunity of different teams from sitting in close proximity and mixing with one another.",

One new area we are exploring to further facilitate physical distancing between patients is a \"Precision Appointment\" (PrApp) model (Table 1 ). This PrApp model was conceptualised as part of our Future Radiological Sciences Patient Journey project in preparation for a new hospital complex. However, some elements of this PrApp model are being fast-tracked to enable further physical distancing of patients. Inspired by the Toyota company \"Just-In-Time\" production method of arranging small deliveries of exactly the correct of amount of material required for manufacturing, the PrApp model allows patients to have highly customised and accurate appointment times so that they are able to walk-in, get scanned and leave the department with zero to minimal dwell time in the department. The PrApp model is especially useful for complex studies which require additional pre-scan preparation.",

And these policies must be packaged as a new normative state, ingrained within all our DNA. Perhaps most importantly, radiology leadership must educate, facilitate, and if needed, strongly reinforce these concepts. We, as radiology services, have our own unique role to play during this pandemic. Our experience over the last 11 weeks may help others do their part in flattening the curve, allowing us as a community to remain safe and emerge re-vitalized and stronger than before. ",
