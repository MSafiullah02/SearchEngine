Animal feed is specifically formulated to ensure that the necessary balance of nutrients is provided to the animal for proper growth, development, and maintenance. The feeding of manufactured animal feeds ensures that the animal receives all the required nutrients and supplements absent from the animal\u2019s natural diet. According to the American Feed Industry Association (AAFCO, Association of American Feed Control Officials) over 900 agricultural ingredients and co-products are used to produce animal feeds and pet foods. These ingredients include cereal grains (corn, oats, wheat, etc.), oilseeds and meals (canola meal, soybean meal, etc.), and various processing by-products (corn gluten meal, distillers products, wheat bran, etc.) (http://www.afia.org/howmade). In addition to plant-based ingredients, animal-based products make up a large portion of animal feeds and pet foods. Animal-based proteins can be derived from whole cuts after slaughter or from rendering of portions not used for human consumption (Sapkota et al., 2007). Rendered animal proteins and products include the portions not consumed by humans, including bones, fat, blood, feathers, and some internal organs (Meeker and Hamilton, 2006).",

In all cases, raw materials are received and included in species-specific formulations. Animal diet formulations take into account the required nutrients of the animal and the nutrients provided by the raw ingredients. The manufacture of raw ingredients into complete finished feeds can include multiple processes. These processes can include grinding, mixing, pelleting, and/or extrusion. Grinding can be done through a roller mill or hammer mill. The goal of grinding is to ensure all components for the finished feed have a similar particle size for uniform distribution during further processing and consumption. Following grinding, all ingredients must be mixed or blended for uniform distribution. Uniformly blended feeds can be further processed by pelleting or extrusion, both thermally intensive processes. During both pelleting and extrusion, the ground ingredients are passed through a mixing chamber and pushed through a die of a desired size. Pelleted and extruded products can increase bulk density and improve handling along with improving protein digestibility. The form of the complete finished diets can vary, from ground mash types to pelleted. Finished pet foods can also be in various forms, from kibbles to pate with gravy to jerky type.",

            "text": "The ingredients in complete animal feeds come from a wide range of raw materials, so it is not surprising that contamination with enteric pathogens, like Salmonella, occurs (Ge et al., 2013). The link between the spread of Salmonella from contaminated animal feed to both animals and humans causing illness has been well established (Jones, 2011, Crump et al., 2002). Along with Salmonella, food-producing animals have been identified as major reservoirs for many human pathogens, including Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp., Escherichia coli (including O157:H7), Yersinia spp., and Enterococcus spp. (Mead et al., 1999, Crump et al., 2002). While pathogens of bacterial origin seem to be the most prevalent, viral pathogens should not be overlooked as possible hazards in animal feeds and pet foods. More recently the coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been found to be transmitted via feed (Dee et al., 2014, Pasick et al., 2014). Although PEDV is not a human pathogen, it generated significant economic losses in North America after its introduction in 2013 (Cochrane et al., 2016a, Cochrane et al., 2016b). In swine feeds, PEDV was the first substantial viral pathogen to be transmitted by feed and may not be the only. More recently mammalian orthoreovirus has been detected in swine feces and swine blood meal with contaminated blood meal found to be infective (Narayanappa et al., 2015). In addition to swine viruses being reported, a surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported in many poultry flocks throughout the United States in 2015 (APHIS Report). However, no definitive proof-of-concept studies have established feed as a vector for HPAI, as of this publication.",

TSE includes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and chronic wasting disease (CWD). TSEs are hypothesized to be caused by an infectious proteinaceous entity called a prion. Prions are composed largely of a protease-resistant misfolding of proteins. BSE, also known as mad cow disease, was first linked to human illness of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a human neurodegenerative prion disease. vCJD was first described in the United Kingdom in 1995 in two teenagers. Further investigation into vCJD in humans indicated the causative prion of vCJD humans was also the causative prion of BSE in cattle. The introduction of infectious prions into the human population has been attributed to the consumption of contaminated meats. It is proposed that prions are introduced into animals via rendered animal products of diseased animals. Prions may be present in all tissues of diseased animals; they are known to accumulate in central nervous system tissues, including skull, brains, eyes, parts of the vertebral column, spinal cord, trigeminal ganglia, and dorsal root ganglia. The aforementioned tissues with accumulated prions are referred to as specified risk materials (SRMs) and are banned from use in cattle and other ruminant feeds. However, SRMs are permitted in feeds for nonruminants, including poultry (Crump et al., 2002, Sapkota et al., 2007, Denton et al., 2005).",

This rule must be followed by nearly all facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold animal food.

This includes identifying all ingredients and process steps occurring at the feed manufacturing facility. This allows for the identification of potential points of entry into the facility, opportunities for cross-contamination within the facility, and potential points of control of biological hazards. Following biological hazard identification, all identified hazards must be evaluated for the hazard\u2019s severity and probability of occurrence within the facility.

Although real-time testing of all ingredients for all potential biological hazards is not possible, implementation of preventative programs can help reduce the risk of receiving contaminated ingredients. These preventative programs include development of purchase specifications with suppliers. All safety specifications and expectations of ingredients should be clearly communicated with suppliers to ensure the safety of inbound ingredients. Verification of ingredient\u2013supplier protocols and on-site manufacturing facility can also be implemented. Once specifications are in place, it is important to maintain enforcement with routine audits when possible. Ensuring suppliers follow CGMPs can also be another barrier in reducing contamination risks.",

Proper biosecurity plans should address the activities of inbound drivers during receiving. If at all possible, all drivers should not exit the vehicle during delivery. If that is not possible, disposable foot covers for boots should be provided to drivers to reduce the risk of transferring hazards from footwear. While not applicable at all facilities, covers over ingredient pits should remain in place until the truck is ready to unload. In addition, all trucks entering the facility for pit unloading should have all mud and debris removed prior to entering. Documentation is also a key component. When possible, all pertinent information regarding ingredients being delivered should be collected. This includes date, time, and lot number. Additionally, inbound truck information should be collected, including previous loads and the clean-out/disinfection schedule. Other precautions when receiving bulk ingredients through a pit include the use of cone or funneling devices to limit the quantity of material spilled during unloading and prevent spilled material from being swept into the ingredient pit. All spillage should be discarded and not swept into the pit as the area around the pit can easily be contaminated. Special precautions should also be made when receiving high-risk ingredients.",

This risk is even higher if the person has recently been on an animal farm or other feed manufacturing facility. As mentioned previously, drivers should remain in the vehicle whenever possible or wear disposable boot covers. Areas of high risk, like receiving, should be restricted from nonemployee access when possible. Additionally, the foot traffic of mill employees should be monitored.

The spread of contamination throughout the facility can occur due to the spread of contaminated dust, foot traffic of employees and visitors, or movement of equipment. Cross-contamination can also occur within equipment that is considered clean. Many times, residual organic material can remain on equipment after production of a product has been completed. Equipment with the highest risk of cross-contamination includes screw conveyers, pellet coolers, storage bins, and bucket elevator boot pits (Cochrane et al., 2016a, Cochrane et al., 2016b). Residual material found in these high-risk types of equipment is primarily due to their design. The use of flushing and sequencing of diets has been suggested as a method to help reduce the risk of cross-contamination from occurring. Flushing typically consists of running an ingredient, usually an abrasive type of material, through the system between batches to flush out any residual material. Sequencing requires the order of production, storage, and distribution to be preplanned to reduce the carryover of high-risk ingredients to sensitive diets.

As previously mentioned, truck drivers should remain in the vehicle when possible to avoid tracking potential contaminated materials on footwear. When drivers are required to exit the vehicle, shoe covers should be worn and hands sanitized before reentering the truck.

Temperature, residence time at a given temperature, and moisture are the major factors influencing the microbial lethality during the conditioning process. Estimates of reduction of Salmonella in animal feed indicate roughly 103 colony-forming units (cfu) per 100 g are destroyed starting at temperatures of 71\u00b0C (Stott et al., 1975). Both time and temperature are crucial for reduction or elimination of biological pathogens, like Salmonella. Several researchers have determined target temperatures of 80\u201385\u00b0C during conditioning to destroy Salmonella (Jones and Richardson, 2004, Veldman et al., 1995). More recently the minimum temperature for destruction of PEDV was noted to be at 54\u00b0C during pelleting. Pelleting temperatures of 38 and 43\u00b0C were found to not sufficiently destroy PEDV and led to infection in a piglet bioassay (Cochrane et al., 2015a, Cochrane et al., 2015b). The residence time during conditioning can range from seconds to minutes, depending on the equipment involved. However, with the development of new equipment, conditioning temperatures and times have been enhanced to improve lethality to microbial contaminants (Jones, 2011). The use of expanders in the pelleting process have increased conditioning temperatures to 115\u2013125\u00b0C and pressures up to 1200 psi for periods of 10\u201320 s. The reported reduction in bacterial load with the use of expanders was 105 to 106\n cfu/g (Francher et al., 1996). In addition to temperatures reached during conditioning, the physical action of the pellet mill rollers pushing the conditioned feed through the die results in a temperature increase due to friction. This increase in temperature is a minimal amount of 1\u20132\u00b0C. This minimal increase in temperature likely has no impact on destruction of microorganisms as the increased temperature is applied to feed for a fraction of a second (Jones, 2011). The final stage of the pelleting process, cooling, removes heat and moisture via large volumes of air. Air temperature and flow must be closely monitored to ensure proper cooling of pellets. Condensation can form within the pellet cooler when the temperature of the top and walls of the cooler drops below the dew point of the entering air. Generated condensation can create an environment conducive for Salmonella or other biological hazard growth (Jones, 2011).",

            "text": "Pet food kibbles are typically manufactured through the process of extrusion, rather than pelleting. Although pelleting and extrusion are similar, extruded diets typically have higher moisture contents and subjected to higher shear and pressure levels. During extrusion, feed is guided by a single or double screw through a barrel with increasing restrictions and forced through a die. This process generates heat and pressure. Sudden expansion of the product also occurs as the product exits the die due to the pressure differential generated. Feed composition, moisture content, processing temperature and pressure, and retention time can all influence product expansion at the die exit. Studies validating extrusion as a kill step for Salmonella or other pathogens are limited. For process validation, the specific production equipment should be used to conduct validations. Benchtop or pilot-scale equipment may vary in replication of industrial processes. Generally, industrial or production-scale equipment is not available for controlled validation studies with pathogens. Introduction of pathogens into a pet food manufacturing facility for validation would have a significant impact on food/feed safety. To compensate for the inability to use actual pathogens for testing, surrogate microorganisms that pose no risk to human or animal health can be used. However, not all microorganisms behave in a similar fashion, so translation of processing temperatures and time from the surrogate to actual pathogen may not be correct. To date, Enterococcus faecium has been used as a Salmonella surrogate during processing of almonds, extrusion of a balanced carbohydrate-protein meal, and a poultry feed (Jeong et al., 2011; Bianchini et al., 2012, Cochrane et al., 2015a, Cochrane et al., 2015b). Some have also suggested the use of microorganisms with a higher heat tolerance to ensure process robustness. However, the conditions to achieve inactivation of heat-resistant organisms can be misleading and much higher than needed for pathogen destruction or within reason for the feed and feed industries (Okelo et al., 2006, Okelo et al., 2008). Of the studies that have evaluated the inactivation of pathogens during extrusion, the temperature and retention times are varied. Evaluation of Clostridium sporogenes in a mixture of mechanically deboned turkey and white corn flour by twin-screw extrusion resulted in a 4- to 5-log reduction at 115.6\u00b0C and a 2-log reduction at 93.3\u00b0C (Li et al., 1993). Inactivation of Streptococcus thermophiles in whey protein isolate occurred in twin-screw extrusion with a 4.2-log reduction at 143\u00b0C and a 4.9-log reduction at 135\u00b0C (Queguiner et al., 1989). Reduction of Salmonella in controlled extrusion studies has been variable. Temperatures of 93.3\u2013176.8\u00b0C were found to completely eliminate Salmonella in feed samples with 25%\u201335% moisture (Crane et al., 1973). Other studies revealed that the elimination of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium occurred at 83\u00b0C in feed with 28.5% moisture (Okelo et al., 2006). As with pelleting, extrusion offers only a point-in-time mitigation and does not prevent finished product cross-contamination following processing.",

Following finished feed irradiation or thermal processing, cross-contamination at multiple points can lead to contamination. The inclusion of chemical additives, either alone or in combination with other mitigation techniques, has become of more interest and may help decrease the risk of cross-contamination. Common chemical additives include organic acids and formaldehyde, with more recent research evaluating essential oils, medium chain fatty acids, and acidulants like sodium bisulfate.",

All these organic acids have been shown to be effective at reducing Salmonella in various feed and food matrices (Amado et al., 2013, Anang et al., 2007, Koyuncu et al., 2013, Menconi et al., 2013). Propionic acid has been shown to destroy 90% of the cell population within 1 h and formic acid within 3 h of treatment (Cherrington et al., 1991). The combination of propionic and formic acids in a blend evaluated by Carrique-Mas et al. (2007) performed similarly to a combination of lactic, propionic, formic, and benzoic acids by Cochrane et al., 2016a, Cochrane et al., 2016b in the mitigation of Salmonella in feed. The proposed mode of action of organic acid treatment to mitigate Salmonella contamination suggests that organic acids penetrate the cell membrane and enter the bacterial cell\u2019s cytoplasm, where they dissociate causing the pH of the cell to increase, causing cell atrophy (Brul and Coote, 1999). There are further advantages to organic acid treatments compared to formaldehyde because organic acids are proposed to be relatively stable in feed and can occur naturally in living organisms and therefore may have greater consumer appeal when listed on an ingredient label (Wales et al., 2010).",

The phenolic compounds in essential oils are proposed as essential to their mode of action as bactericidal compounds (Rasooli et al., 2006). Some essential oils can contain phenol compounds that are thought to interact with and disrupt the cell membrane of bacteria, causing the cell to lose functional properties and leak the inner cell materials (Rasooli et al., 2006). More recently, a combination of garlic oleoresin, turmeric oleoresin, capsicum oleoresin, rosemary extract, and wild oregano essential oils was shown to be effective at mitigation of Salmonella Typhimurium in avian blood meal (Cochrane et al., 2016a, Cochrane et al., 2016b).",

These specially formulated blends of plant- and animal-based ingredients provide all the essential nutrients for the intended species. Due to the wide range of raw materials used to make complete feeds, there is potential for contamination of various enteric pathogens, like Salmonella. The contamination of livestock animal feeds and pet foods with pathogens can lead to the colonization of livestock and companion animals, ultimately leading to human illness. Contamination is not only limited to bacterial pathogens but can also be contaminated with viral pathogens (PEDV) and TSEs (BSE and CWD). With the recent implementation of the FSMA, animal feeds and pet foods have come under more scrutiny and require manufacturers to specifically identify potential hazards and evaluate control measures to ensure animal food safety. Control measures to ensure the manufacture of safe finished animal foods include physical and chemical intervention methods. Physical intervention can include prevention (implementing a feed mill biosecurity plan), thermal processing (pelleting and/or extrusion), and irradiation (gamma, UV, or electron beam). Chemical interventions can include the use of various chemical additives (organic acids, formaldehyde, medium chain fatty acids, and essential oils). Additionally, a combination of physical and chemical methods can mitigate the risk of contamination of finished feeds even more. Although the risk of contamination by biological hazards in animal feeds cannot be completely eliminated, feed manufacturers have multiple methods to help reduce the risk.",
