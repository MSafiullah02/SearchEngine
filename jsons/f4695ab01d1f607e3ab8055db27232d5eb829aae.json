Results: All 91 AdV pneumonia patients presented with acute respiratory symptoms and radiological infiltrations and had significantly lower levels of white blood cell counts and platelet counts compared with non-AdV pneumonia.

Regarding the abnormal haematological findings associated with the severity of AdV infection, Chen et al. recently indicated that patients with pneumonia, upper respiratory infection and asymptomatic infections had higher neutrophil percentages, lower lymphocyte percentages and lower platelet counts compared with healthy controls. 19 However, they reported that patients with relatively severe infections, such as pneumonia or upper respiratory infection, tended to have higher monocyte percentages than those with asymptomatic infection or healthy controls during acute phases of infection. This partial contradiction between studies regarding the monocyte percentage in AdV infections could be explained by the fact that we only included pneumonia patients and compared characteristics according to the presence of RF, reflecting disease progression.
