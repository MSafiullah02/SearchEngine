In recent years, though, enough information has accumulated about the causes of asthma that one can weave a story containing useful advice that may help patients participate in the management of their disease. And there are also recent studies that can provide answers to the questions posed by physicians who have watched in puzzlement as their previously well-controlled asthma patients have spiraled rapidly out of control. This story has been growing increasingly complex, with an ever-expanding cast of players that sometimes creates a tangled web of interactions.",

The concept of causal agent, though, has a variety of different interpretations. In general, agents may act on the respiratory tract to initiate asthma or to exacerbate it. Initiation (or inception or development) of asthma refers to the start of asthma in a patient who was previously entirely free of this problem. An exacerbation (or trigger or precipitating event) means the significant and often sudden worsening of an established chronic asthmatic condition. Avoidance of a proven initiating factor, if possible, could permit the primary prevention of asthma. In contrast, avoidance of triggering events will not halt the disease but only decrease the number of exacerbations in someone who already has chronic illness. In studying and treating asthma, identification of a specific trigger is usually much easier than trying to prove an initiating cause.",

This individual will return quickly to equilibrium and a low inflammatory state. The path of system B illustrates how multiple stressors, including genetic factors and atopic immune development, may interact with a viral infection to cause a long lasting or perhaps permanent change in the level of mucosal inflammation. Some details of risk factors will be outlined and discussed in this chapter, but systems biology or systems medicine cannot yet specify each feature of the set of interactions in a way that leads to firm predictions about asthma. Out of the complexity of the systems approach, though, some simple and compact principles do emerge, so that every precondition does not have to be known to predict the outcome of intervention or treatment.\n",

Age is a marker for the development and maturation of the immune system, which diversifies greatly over time. As the human body ages, the immune system molds itself to the environment to become a mirror image of specific, usually protein, molecules in the external local surroundings. Age also has an important effect on the physics of scaling in the respiratory system. Airway resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of diameter, which enlarges with age until young adulthood and then slowly declines. Small increases in airway diameter therefore lead to huge reductions in airway resistance and give more \u201cbreathing room.\u201d",

As noted, HRV is the most potent of triggers, though all HRVs do not seem to be alike. Pathogenicity of HRV appears to vary among groups A, B, and C. HRV-C was found in a study of hospitalized preschool children to be associated with asthma more often than HRV-A (26), and HRV-C was noted to be the most frequent type found in patients presenting to the emergency department (27). In contrast, experimental infection with a type of HRV-A resulted in no worse illness in allergic than in nonallergic subjects (28). Knowledge of a circulating virulent HRV strain in the community could put clinicians on the alert for more serious symptoms in their asthmatic patients with colds.",

As a conceptual model, one can create two opposing poles. At one pole is the small child who experiences rare mild wheezing with acute viral illness, has no wheezing or cough between episodes, and has no atopy or parental asthma. These children appear to benefit very little or not at all from acute or chronic corticosteroid therapy for viral-triggered wheezing illness (29). At the other pole are children who wheeze daily or weekly, have an atopic history, have a parental history of asthma, and may be on chronic controller therapy. A viral infection in these children appears to be a trigger that requires a step up in asthma therapy, perhaps to a burst of oral corticosteroids. Between these poles of severity are many children whose therapy must be individualized. The criteria from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program help select preschool children who may benefit from acute and/or chronic corticosteroids. These guidelines use the Asthma Predictive Index (30) to specify which wheezy small children have or likely will have chronic asthma and could benefit from various forms of inhaled and oral corticosteroid therapy.\n",

Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of these pollutants in most locations. Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide gases diffuse rapidly and impact upon the wet respiratory tract to produce highly irritating acids. Sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory constriction in asthmatic patients at concentrations of 0.1 ppm when exercising (44). Healthy adults begin experiencing increased airway resistance at 5 ppm, and even nonasthmatic adults will develop bronchospasm at 20 ppm, though these levels would be highly unusual in outdoor air pollution. Nitrogen oxides, and especially NO2, are also irritating to the upper and lower respiratory tracts at low levels, and patients with asthma are more susceptible to these adverse effects. Higher concentrations of outdoor NO2 were associated with more asthma symptoms in a study of inner city children (45). Though the mechanism of action is uncertain, exposure to carbon monoxide in city air was found in one European study to worsen lung function in adult patients with asthma (43).",

High average ozone and airborne particulate matter were associated with more frequent asthma symptoms and ED visits and hospital stays in a study of asthma sufferers in the San Joaquin Valley in California (46). Ozone from air pollution has been shown to exacerbate asthma in children and adults, though this effect may be greater in children (47).

The AQI, which is determined on the basis of the highest pollutant of the day, may be considered safe for patients with chronic respiratory disease if less than 50 (green zone). On days with poor air quality, asthma sufferers should come inside where pollutant levels are typically much lower.

Some of the most significant advances in medical care have come through the treatment and prevention of viral illnesses, and furthering the understanding of respiratory viruses is a worthy priority for the future study of asthma prevention and treatment. In addition to natural harmful infectious particles, humans in recent decades have added many substances of their own creation, including the molecules and particles that constitute indoor and outdoor air pollution.
