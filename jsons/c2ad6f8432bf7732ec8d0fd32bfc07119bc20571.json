Most of the cases result in mild or no symptoms, but some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. At this moment, it is estimate that 1 out of 5 cases needs hospitalization [31] . It is yet difficult to estimate the mortality of this virus. Mortality depends on one side on early detection and appropriate treatment, but the rate itself can only be calculated if the real number of infected people is known. There is enough evidence to assure that a significant portion of the infections is asymptomatic [19, 22, 25] , which makes it difficult to detect them and thus to calculate the effective mortality of COVID-19. WHO, by March 2020, estimated a death rate of 3,4% worldwide [33] . But in some countries, as Italy, France, Spain and UK, the rate between deaths and confirmed cases up to May 2020 is higher than 10% [46] .",

We model isolation by separating the population in two groups: one composed by keyworkers that keep working during the pandemic and having a usual contact rate, and the other group consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. Certainly, in the group of people that maintain a high contact rate one can also include people that do not respect social distancing restrictions, that has lately shown to be significant in some countries. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. Testing is supposed to be applied to all symptomatic cases, and to a portion of the population selected using some of the criteria adopted by health organizations (see e.g. [9, 11] ). The idea to analyze the quantitative effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as isolation and social distancing, on the evolution of the epidemic was inspired by the work [10] . For the proposed model, we obtain an expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control parameters. In this way we can quantify the effects that isolation and testing have on the epidemic. We exhibit a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic situations. We compare, in particular, different levels of isolation and testing. From the expression of R 0 and the simulations, we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more lives can be saved.

In [3] they consider a simple model, with infected and reported infected compartments, and they assume that the transmission rate \u03b2 is a function of a control u, this is \u03b2 = \u03b2(u). They analyze feedback control strategies, where the control depends on the number of reported cases. In [8] they consider mild and severe cases, the latter having a reduced transmission rate since they are assumed to be in isolation. They use a time-dependent control c of reduction of contacts for the whole population, and optimize with respect to this control. An SEIR model with quarantine for suspected and infected cases cases is considered in [37] , and in [21] they take into account unreported cases, asymptomatic individuals and quarantine for identified cases.",

After a given latent time, an individual in E becomes infectious, and thus is allocated to the compartment I. At this stage, after a suitable time, the individual may either remain infectious but asymptomatic (or with mild symptoms), in which case moves to the compartment A, or may show clear symptoms onset, thus being tested and then quarantined either at home or at the hospital, and being assigned to the compartment Q.

Similarly, the model can include the case of reactivation of the virus in an individual previously declared recovered (and not newly exposed to the virus), by inserting a transfer term from the compartment R into I f and I r , with appropriate coefficients depending on the probability of the reactivation of the virus and on the inverse of the average time of reactivation. However, at the moment there are not strong evidences supporting such possibility [38] .",

A crucial issue while coping with the outbreak of the epidemic, which leads to the so-called urge of flattening the curve, is whether the number of critical cases in need of intensive care (IC) treatment (due to respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure) would saturate the number of available intensive care units (ICUs). This parameter can be estimated directly from model (1), considering for each country the number of available ICUs and the percentage of positive confirmed cases requiring IC treatment. For example, this percentage has been estimated to be about 6% for China [4] , and up to 12% for Italy [12, 35] . As an alternative, it would be possible to insert a further compartment C in model (1) counting the number of the individuals needing ICU treatment, by modifying the equations corresponding to the compartments Q and D as follows:",

In some countries, like Italy, the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases up to May 2020 is larger that 0.1, while in others, like Israel, it is around 0.01. Regarding the time a person takes to die from COVID-19, in [49] they estimated 18.5 days from infectiousness onset to death. 9 . The values of p and r vary in each country/territory depending on the public policies and the population's compliance to these measures. A detailed and real-time survey on the percentage of people under lockdown in each country can be found in [14] . 10 . As already mentioned in Remark 2.1, \u03c1 represents the proportion of the infected asymptomatic population that is tested daily.

Many states started their lockdown between March 15th and March 20th, which put around 60% of the population in isolation [14] . We can assume that day 0 is February 15th, then day 31 would be in the middle point of the interval when lockdowns started. Day 80 (May 6th) US had 72,287 confirmed deaths, while in Scenario A 2 gives 91,231, that is larger but not far. Scenario A 2 could be a good approximation of the situation in the US until the beginning of May 2020, and the excess in the computed deaths in comparison to real data suggests that deaths could be underreported by 26%, which is coherent with some recent studies on underreported deaths (see e.g. [47] ). For Scenario A 4 we make a comparison of infections for the two groups: the active one (that continues with the usual contact rate) and the one in r-isolation. By comparing the infections' curves and the cumulative infections, we can give an estimate on the lower chance that people in r-isolation have to get exposed. In this particular scenario, people that are not in isolation have nearly 6 times more chance to be infected. See the graphs in Figure 3 , were we show the curves of infections and cumulative infections for each group, normalized by the proportions 1 \u2212 p, p. We measure the outcomes. The parameters and results are given in Table 7 , and graphics in Figure 5 . The parameters that are not specified in Table 7 , are repeated from Table 6 .

Nevertheless, the decision makers and each individual shall be aware that a value of R 0 only barely greater than 1 would lead to an increase in the number of infected and dead by an order 2 of magnitude, thus provoking the collapse of the relative national health system. This is better explained by the following scenarios: consider a situation with constant testing \u03c1 = 0.05 and no lockdown where, after the first 35 days of outbreak with a high R 0 (\u2248 2), the population gains awareness of the risk and manage to reduce its contact rate so as to steer R 0 to either 0.9, 1 or 1.1.

So achieving herd immunity would imply to infect at least 60% of the population, which would lead, with the current mortality rates, to 1-5% of the population dying, which is, obviously, a catastrophic unwanted situation. Hence, reinforcing what was said in the above paragraph, until a vaccine or treatment is not found, it is necessary to maintain the value of R 0 below 1.

Alternatively, a way to force the system to comply all the technical assumptions from [40] is adding birth and natural mortality to our model, which has no relevant impact in the results we showed (since the natural daily birth/death rates are of the order of 10 \u22125 , hence negligible w.r.t. the other parameters).",

In particular, if we increase k times the parameter \u03b2, then T 0 increases k times as well. Similar deductions can be made on the other parameters, with the corresponding coefficients obtained by inserting the values of the parameters from Table 5 . Moreover, from the expression of S \u03c4 we realize that, if either \u03c1 or \u03b4 equal zero, then T 0 does not depend on \u03c4 (as it happens for R 0 as well, as noticed in Remark 3.2). Similarly, if \u03c1 = 0, then S \u03b4 = 0, thus T 0 does not depend on \u03b4. Regarding the parameters p and r, their dependence is mutually related as follows: if p = 0, then T 0 does not depend on r (since S r = 0), whereas if r = 1 then T 0 does not depend on p.",
