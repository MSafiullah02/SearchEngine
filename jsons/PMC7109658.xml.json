Detection of mRNA for CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 in cardiomyocytes from mice infected with T. cruzi has been previously reported [10]. Here, we examined whether these chemokines were also expressed in the cardiac tissue of mice infected with T. cruzi. No detectable expression of CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA and only a very low expression of CCL5 mRNA were found in the myocardia of uninfected wt mice. Infection with T. cruzi resulted in significant mRNA for CCL3 and CCL4 and enhanced mRNA for CCL5 in the myocardia on day 15 after infection (figure 1A). Moreover, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 were also detected by immunohistochemistry in the myocardia of infected mice but not in the myocardia of uninfected mice (figure 1B). Presence of the chemokines was clearly associated with infiltrated cells in cardiac tissue. As shown in figure 1B, there was a mononuclear interstitial infiltrate in the myocardia of infected mice that was positive for the presence of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 chemokines. The staining was most intense in the cardiac tissue obtained on days 17\u201320 after infection. In the myocardia of uninfected mice, no inflammatory infiltrate was present, and no staining for CC chemokines was observed.",

Because CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 bind to CCR5 on the surface of leukocytes, we examined whether the inflammatory cells in the myocardia of infected mice expressed CCR5. These experiments showed that there were very few CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in uninfected mice (figure 2A) and that the number of these cells increased markedly after infection (figure 2C and 2D). When we examined mouse cardiac tissue obtained during the acute phase of infection, we found that the inflammatory infiltrate was predominantly composed of CD8+ T cells (figure 2C and 2D). The quantification of T cells infiltrating the cardiac tissue (figure 3A) revealed that the majority of CD3+ T cells in the cardiac tissue of infected mice were also CD8+ (figure 3B). Other cells found in cardiac tissue expressed CD11c (11%), CD14 (7%), and CD56 (20%). Expression of CCR5 was found to be positive in the majority of leukocytes in inflammatory infiltrate (figure 2B), indicating that a significant amount of CD8+ T cells expressed CCR5. Indeed, double immunofluorescence labeling revealed that the majority of CD8+ T cells (figure 2F), but not of CD4+ T cells (figure 2E), expressed CCR5. These data were confirmed by flow-cytometry analysis, which showed that 70% of CD8+ and 20% of CD4+ T cells that were isolated from myocardia during acute infection expressed CCR5 (figure 3A and 3B).",

Because there was a high expression of CCR5 in T cells found in cardiac tissue, we evaluated whether the parasites could modulate the expression of CCR5 in lymphocytes. Splenocytes were incubated with trypomastigote forms or with ConA, and the expression of CD4, CD8, CCR5, and CCR3 was evaluated. As shown in figure 4A, incubation with trypomastigote forms, but not with ConA, induced a significant enhancement of the expression of CCR5 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Incubation of splenocytes with the parasites or ConA did not alter the expression of CCR3 (figure 4A). These results show that incubation of splenocytes with trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi for 40 h results in enhanced expression of CCR5 on the surface of murine T cells.",

Moreover, although the mortality of wt mice was 50% on day 26 after infection, all CCR5-/- had died by that day (P < .05) (figure 5B). Interestingly, the intensity and kinetics of diffuse and focal inflammatory infiltrates were different in the cardiac tissue of CCR5-/- and wt mice infected with the parasite. Although, on day 20 after infection, significant inflammatory infiltrates were found in the myocardia of wt mice infected with T. cruzi (figure 6C), these were almost absent in the myocardia of CCR5-/- mice infected with T. cruzi (figure 6D). Instead, we found very large amounts of parasite nests (figure 6D), such that in several microscopy fields the amounts of parasites in the tissue were virtually uncountable. Also noticeable was the finding that the sizes of parasite nests in CCR5-/- mice were bigger than those in wt mice. In contrast, rare, isolated parasite nests were found in the cardiac tissue of wt mice (figure 6C). Absence of cell infiltrate was found in uninfected wt (figure 6A) and CCR5-/- (figure 6B) mice.",

However, much less is known about the mechanisms governing the migration of leukocytes to sites of tissue infection, especially to hearts of infected hosts. More recently, a group of mediators, the chemokines, have been described in some detail and have been shown to participate in the recruitment of leukocytes in several models of inflammatory diseases [14, 22\u201324]. In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for CCR5-acting chemokines in the control of leukocyte migration and parasite replication during the acute phase of infection with the Y strain of T. cruzi. This strain induces a parasitemia that peaks around days 9\u201311 of infection and causes an intense inflammatory reaction in cardiac tissue that is more intense between days 13 and 20 [25].",

Thus, in the present study, it was important to ascertain whether chemokine expression would also occur in vivo after infection of mice with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Indeed, both mRNA and protein for CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 could be found in the cardiac tissue of T. cruzi-infected mice, in close correlationwith tissue inflammation; these results are in agreement with the findings of other studies [14\u201316]. Notably, these latter studies showed that the expression of chemokines was greatly under the control of IFN-\u03b3 and that the modulation of chemokine expression was accompanied by the modulation of the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of T. cruzi-induced inflammation [26].

More specifically, there was a marked increase in the number of CD8+ T cells expressing CCR5, as assessed by both immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry analysis. The number of CD4+ T cells expressing CCR5 in the cardiac tissue of infected mice also increased, but to a lesser extent. Interestingly, the increased expression of CCR5 on tissue lymphocytes was mirrored by a significant increase in the expression of this receptor on circulating lymphocytes. Indeed, infection with T. cruzi, but not stimulation with ConA, also enhanced the expression of CCR5 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultivated in vitro. These results are in agreement with those of a recent study that showed that both CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells obtained from the peripheral blood of infected patients expressed CCR5 to a greater degree than did those obtained from uninfected individuals [27]. In the latter study, the enhanced CCR5 expression on T cells was lost only when heart failure supervened chronic Chagas disease. Thus, infection with T. cruzi was accompanied by a parasite-associated increase in the expression of CCR5 and migration of T cells to infected tissues, in which several CCR5-acting chemokines are produced. The increased expression of CCR5 could be due to the production of IFN-\u03b3 [28, 29], TNF-\u03b1 [8, 30], interleukin (IL)-10 [7, 31], and/or IL-12 [30, 32, 33] that occurs after the addition of trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi to cultures of splenocytes or after the infection of mice.

In these mice, a higher level of parasitemia and greater mortality was observed, compared with those in T. cruzi-infected wt mice. Moreover, the amount of parasites in the cardiac tissue of CCR5-/- mice was greatly enhanced. The reduced control of parasite replication was associated with a dramatic reduction of the migration of T cells and overall disease, indicating that CCR5 was crucial to the migration of lymphocytes to the hearts of infected mice. Importantly, there was no defect in the ability of macrophages from CCR5-/- mice to produce NO and IL-12 or to kill the parasite in vitro (data not shown). Similar to our results in intracellular adhesion molecule-1-deficient mice [38], the decreased number of lymphocytes in cardiac tissue was associated with decreased local production of IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown) and an increased level of parasitemia, suggesting that there was a defect in the migration of cells capable of producing cytokines (such as IFN-\u03b3) that activate the production of NO. Thus, the lack of CCR5 is accompanied by the inability of CCR5+ T cells to migrate to the hearts of infected mice and the inability of the host to control parasite replication. Similarly, absence of CCR5 leads to increased susceptibility to Cryptococcus neoformans infection, because of the absence of the migration of cells to the brain [18]. On the contrary, a defective trafficking of leukocytes in CCR5-/- mice has been associated with (1) resistance to the development of cerebral malaria in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei [39] and (2) demyelination after infection with mouse hepatitis virus [40].",

These cells may play a role in the damage to the heart that is observed during the chronic phase of disease [41\u201344]. Indeed, cardiac lesions observed during the chronic phase of infection with T. cruzi have been associated with the local inflammatory response that is driven by host immune cells [45, 46]. It is not known, however, whether the CD8+ T cells that infiltrate the hearts of patients with Chagas disease also express CCR5 or whether there is a functional relevance for the observed increase of CCR5 expression on the CD8+ T cells that are obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with Chagas disease [27]. A role for CCR5 in human disease has also been suggested by a study that showed that a point mutation of the CCR5 promoter was significantly increased in asymptomatic patients, compared with that in patients with chagasic cardiomyopathy [47]. It is clear that further studies are necessary to understand the role played by CCR5 in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease.",
