In fact, the close proximity of gatherings in addition to environmental factors during air and sea travel appear to hasten the spread of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The limited available space on both ships and airplanes not only creates confined spaces for airborne droplet transmission but also provides abundant fomites for disease transmission because of large groups of people sharing common areas, such as dining areas and restrooms. Door handles, serving utensils, and other objects are repeatedly handled, and hand hygiene may not be consistently performed.

            "text": "In 1984, the NDMS was formed as part of the Public Health Service in HHS as a partnership between the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the DoD, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The purpose of the NDMS was to provide medical evacuation and definitive care of evacuated military and civilian casualties from overseas war contingencies, with a secondary mission to supplement state and local medical resources during disasters and emergencies. 8 In 2003, after 9/11, the convening authority over the NDMS was granted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security. After Hurricane Katrina, the NDMS was reorganized under the HHS as legislated by an Act of Congress to provide administrative and operational control as outlined in the Public Health Service Act of 2006 and amended by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019. 9 Forward thinking, in conjunction with an increased tempo of military operations, resulted in a diverse focus that included the need to assist with air medical staging and broader humanitarian efforts. This initially led to the development of the mobile acute care strike team, which was intended to serve as a critical care resuscitation and stabilization unit to hold patients awaiting departure from a disaster air medical staging facility (DASF). Patients would arrive from their point of injury/illness to the DASF to await DoD flights to definitive care. The DASF is often collocated with a US Air Force medical group, which provides care to less acute patients and serves as a liaison for military air transport. During a busy hurricane season in 2017, the need for nonmilitary critical care air transport was identified, and the concept behind the HHS AET was born. The HHS AE Team is composed of active critical care and air transport providers who have received training through 2 pathways: the US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine Critical Care Air Transport program (2-4 weeks) or the HHS partnership with Florida International University air medical evacuation course (1-2 weeks). After training, these providers have participated in ongoing validation with multiple air medical transport teams nationwide.",

In conjunction with the DoS contract, the Containerized Biological Containment System was used on overseas repatriation missions inside a Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which was reconfigured for mixed passenger/cargo work (Fig. 1) .",

The physiologic effects of flight and confinement can be difficult for healthy patients, much less those with extensive pathology. Dependent on the specific platform used for the mission, mechanical ventilation may not be possible, further necessitating stabilization before transport.

COVID-19 demonstrated the ease of transmission and highlighted additional areas of concern with the general demographic found on cruise ships. The average age of passengers is 46.9 years, with a median age between 60 and 69 years. 11 This increased age is associated with multiple comorbidities that have proven to be a hallmark of COVID-19 mortality. 12 Early outbreaks on the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess delivered a grim reality-the close quarters of the cruise ship environment allowed COVID-19 to spread almost unchecked, quickly increasing among crew and passengers. Recognizing the inherent danger to passengers and threat to public health during this epidemic, Cruise Lines International Association, the world's largest cruise industry trade association, announced on March 13, 2020, that it was following CDC guidance and temporarily suspending ocean-going cruise operations from US ports of call for 30 days. 13 On February 4, 2020, while off the coast of Japan, the Diamond Princess cruise ship was identified as having multiple COVID-19 \u2212positive patients and placed into quarantine. Of the 3,711 persons on board the ship, all were tested; 712 returned as positive, and 12 later died. There were 338 US citizens evacuated by DoS medical crews on 2 Boeing 747s to quarantine centers in California and Texas where they were received by HHS personnel. There were 14 known positives who were transported on HHS-contracted air flights in an isolation area of the aircraft, and an additional 5 patients were placed into isolation during the flights after developing a fever. Known or suspected positives were taken to local medical treatment facilities upon arrival, and 13 were taken to a treatment facility in Nebraska. Those who became positive or symptomatic during quarantine were also transported to local area hospitals. After local hospital evaluation, some cruise ship evacuees in California were flown via Learjet to medical treatment facilities closer to their home with HHS AETs.",

Aircraft with reduced postmission airing out time offer an added benefit. It is essential that cabin ventilation remain on at all times, including ground delays. In aircraft with poorly controlled interior airflow, such as rotor wing or other nonpressurized fixed wing aircraft, physical barriers are essential.

Steps to mitigate fatigue included adding crews to the staffing rotation to maintain mission tempo and sustain operations. Postmission crew rest periods ranged from 8 to 12 hours before crews reentered the call rotation. Paying special attention to PPE doffing at mission completion to avoid contamination was essential.
