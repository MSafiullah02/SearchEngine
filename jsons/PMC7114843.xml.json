The patient died after 11 days of hospitalization.2 Indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for widely occurring respiratory viruses failed to identify an infective aetiology. Interestingly, cytopathic changes consistent with viral replication were noted in LLC-MK2 and Vero cell cultures of the patient\u2019s respiratory samples. Slides of the infected cell cultures reacted strongly with the patient\u2019s serum but not with any of 2400 control sera stored in the same hospital. However, pan-coronavirus PCR yielded positive results. The PCR fragments were sequenced at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the novel coronavirus belonged to lineage C of the genus betacoronavirus.2, 3 On 20 September 2012, an email was posted on Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases Mail (ProMED-mail) announcing the discovery of a novel human coronavirus.4\n",

Once sequenced, a 250 base-pair fragment from this isolate showed 99.5% homology with the Erasmus Medical Centre\u2019s isolate.5 The third patient was a 45-year-old man who presented to a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on October 10th, 2012, with severe pneumonia and renal failure.

It is possible that the identification of the virus might have been delayed even more, had it not been for the meticulous investigation by a single virologist, Dr A.M. Zaki, of the first reported case of MERS-CoV.2 The first lesson one has to learn from MERS-CoV and its discovery is that continuous vigilance and perseverance with diagnostic investigation of undiagnosed infectious diseases are essential to identify emerging pathogens.",

Moreover, only a small proportion of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection report close contact with camels.17 Even though camels are probably important in the transmission cycle of sporadic MERS-CoV infection, human-to-human transmission remains the likely source of the majority of reported MERS-CoV infections.",

For example, social media were at some point rife with inaccurate information that included rumours of hospitals closed due to MERS-CoV outbreaks and certain social events being nodes for MERS-CoV transmission. The authors are aware of examples of information and photos shared on social media resulting in patients losing their right to privacy and confidentiality. Patients often cancelled their clinic appointments or scheduled surgical procedures for fear of acquiring MERS-CoV while in hospital. Some avoided attending emergency departments despite having acute problems that required medical attention. Some individuals posted videos and messages challenging the suggestion that camels may be a source of MERS-CoV infection.
