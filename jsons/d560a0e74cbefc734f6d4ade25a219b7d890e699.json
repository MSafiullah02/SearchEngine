            "text": "In 1979, it was estimated that between 5 and 18 million people die every year from gastroenteritis, rotavirus being the most important viral agent transmitted through the fecaloral route. In the developing countries the burden of rotavirus disease in children under 5 years of age has been estimated to be over 125 million cases annually, of which 18 million are severe cases, and 500,000-800,000 deaths in children under the age of 4 are attributable to rotavirus diarrhea (Oh et al., 2003; Parashar et al., 1998) . In the developed world, mortality due to rotavirus infection is very low; however, it remains an important cause of morbidity and of hospitalization in young children. Additionally, hepatitis A accounts for around half the total number of hepatitis cases diagnosed worldwide, and some regions, such as some areas in the Mediterranean region, are still endemic for hepatitis A. Poliomyelitis, not too long ago the most feared viral disease, has not yet been eradicated, although this long pursued objective seems presently within reach. Norwalk-like viruses, the type species of genus Norovirus and formerly included in the SRSV (small round structured viruses), account for over 90% of foodborne gastroenteritis affecting children and adults (Lopman et al., 2003) . Additionally, astroviruses were reported in 1996 to be second only to rotaviruses as a cause of hospitalization for childhood viral gastroenteritis (Glass et al., 1996) , while adenoviruses and Sapporo-like viruses have also been recognized as significant etiological agents of epidemic nonbacterial diarrhea (Lopman et al., 2003) . Hepatitis E virus, currently unclassified, is the primary cause in tropical and subtropical developing countries of an enterically transmitted non-A non-B hepatitis, with a mortality rate of up to 20% in pregnant women (Reyes, 1993; Schlauder & Mushahwar, 2001) .",

Viruses are present in high numbers in raw wastewater and current water treatment practices fail to ensure the complete removal of viral pathogens (Rao & Melnick, 1986 ) ; consequently, viruses become environmental pollutants. There are several routes by which viruses reach the sea, including direct discharge of treated or untreated sewage effluents, unintentional discharges by urban and rural run-off, waste input from boats, and via rivers when the discharges take place in fresh water. Mankind is exposed to enteric viruses in seawater mainly through the consumption of shellfish grown in contaminated waters, or to a lesser extent through recreational activities in sewage-polluted waters.",

            "text": "The type of treatment will ultimately determine the concentration of pathogens in treated sewage and sludge, and their relative risk of disposal. An overview of the fate of enteric viruses in coastal environments is depicted in Figure 5 .2. Domestic sewage may be disposed of directly in the marine environment by coastal outfalls or by dumping from barges, and may occur in the form of raw sewage, treated effluent, or sewage sludge. Virus concentrations of 5000-100,000 PFU/l are commonly reported in raw sewage (Rao & Melnick, 1986) , and may be greatly reduced during treatment; however an average of 50-100 PFU/l are normally found in effluents from water treatment plants (Rao & Melnick, 1986) . In any case, viruses readily adsorb onto the abundant suspended solids present in sewage and are discharged solid-associated into marine environments (Fig. 5.2A ). While viruses associated with small-size (<3 \u00b5m) particulate material tend to float in the water column, viruses adsorbed onto large/medium (>6 \u00b5m) particles readily settle down in the bottom sediment. Viruses accumulate in the loose fluffy top layer of the compact bottom sediment (Fig. 5 .2B) and are thereby protected from inactivation by natural or artificial processes (Rao et al., 1986a; Sobsey et al., 1988) . Sediments in coastal seawaters act as reservoirs from which viruses may be subsequently resuspended by several natural or artificial phenomena. Shellfish (Fig. 5.2C ), being filter feeders, tend to concentrate viruses and bacteria in their edible tissues, and concentrations of these microorganisms in shellfish may be much higher than those in the surrounding water. Shellfish grown and harvested from waters receiving urban contaminants (Fig. 5 .2D) have been implicated in outbreaks of viral diseases, notably viral hepatitis and gastroenteritis Christensen et al., 1998; Halliday et al., 1991; Kingsley et al., 2002; Le Guyader et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "Viruses are potentially dangerous contaminants of the sea, as products of human activities. Table 5 .2 lists some reports on the isolation of human enteric viruses in coastal and estuarine seawaters. Human pathogenic viruses are not only found in the millions of liters of variously treated human wastes dumped directly into coastal waters from sewage outfalls, but also from runoff from numerous storm drain sewers. Although the ocean offers relatively rapid dilution of treated sewage, it appears that dilution phenomena may not be enough to minimize the impact of virus pollution when contaminant affluents discharge at or within a short distance of the shoreline (Bosch et al., 1988a; Hugues et al., 1980) . Based on this evidence, barges are employed to dump treated effluents at considerable distances from the shore. Nevertheless, sea bathing and water sport activities, which are becoming increasingly popular, may be nowadays not only expanded beyond the traditional summer seasons but also carried out at long distances from the shore. The full impact of viral pollution of recreational seawater on public health is hard to evaluate due to the technical and economical difficulties of virological studies. Nevertheless, epidemiology studies show significant risks associated with swimming near flowing storm drains. Specifically, the incidence of illnesses such as rashes, gastrointestinal disorders, and upper respiratory infections approximately doubled in those swimming at the mouth of a storm drain (Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, 1996) . Additionally, epidemiological data of waterborne illnesses also indicate that the common etiological agents are more likely to be viruses and parasitic protozoa than bacteria, and enteroviruses (polioviruses, coxsackie viruses, echoviruses), hepatitis A and E, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, and noroviruses have all been associated with swimming-related illness (Cabelli et al., 1982; Fattal & Shuval, 1989; Koopman et al., 1982; Moore et al., 1994; Seyfried et al., 1985) . In a routine study conducted on seawater, a widespread poliomyelitis vaccination program conducted in a coastal urban community was reflected in the levels of vaccinal poliovirus in seawater, which demonstrates that environmental monitoring of viruses provides useful evidence on the occurrence of infections, not only apparent but also unapparent, among the population (Lucena et al., 1986) . Table 5 .3 shows some examples of the occurrence of human enteric viruses in marine sediments. Viruses accumulate in the fluffy sediment where the concentrations may be 10-10,000 times greater than those found in water. Sediments represent a reservoir from which viruses may spread when the sediments are disturbed and resuspended in the water column. Resuspension commonly occurs as a result of natural different phenomena, among which are storms, dredging, and tides (Van Donsel & Geldreich, 1971) . Resuspended solid-associated viruses can be transported from polluted to unpolluted recreational or shellfish growing waters and then pose health hazards (Rao et al., 1986a) .",

Usually, no correlation could be demonstrated between virus numbers and any bacterial parameter in marine sediment samples. This lack of correlation is probably due to the different decay rates shown by bacteria and viruses in the environment.

It seems reasonable to assume that environmental factors and the compositional make-up of seawater may be substantially different from one geographical location to another, which implies that different data of virus persistence are produced when the same viral strain is suspended in water sampled from different sites . Several observations demonstrate the potential involvement of native marine microorganisms in the inactivation of viruses in marine habitats, although data on the successful isolation of microorganisms with virucidal properties are scarce (Fujioka et al., 1980; Girones et al., 1990; Bosch et al., 1993) . Additionally, the ability of bacteria to inactivate viruses is usually lost while subculturing the microorganisms in the laboratory, although in a few cases these bacteria could be subcultured for over 1 year without losing their antiviral activity (Girones et al., 1990; Bosch et al., 1993) .",

Generally, commercial growth of shellfish species takes place in shallow, in-shore waters, which may receive occasional sewage pollution. The consumption of shellfish is very clearly linked to the transmission of enteric infections and epidemics have been recorded since medieval times in many countries (Lees, 2000) . These outbreaks are normally caused by shellfish collected by unscrupulous professionals or careless private individuals, from areas where harvesting is prohibited. However, they also occur as a result of eating shellfish from authorized shellfishproducing areas, when these areas have been temporarily polluted (Mackowiak et al., 1976) and sanitary controls fail to provide a safe indication of viral pollution. The first reported association of viruses with shellfish-borne gastroenteritis infection was observed in the winter of 1976-1977 in the United Kingdom when cockles were epidemiologically linked to 33 incidents affecting nearly 800 people (Appleton & Pereira, 1977) . SRSV particles, like those seen in outbreaks of winter vomiting disease, were observed by electron microscopy in a high proportion of patients feces. Regardless of the variety of healthsignificant viruses found in shellfish, norovirus and hepatitis A virus are the most relevant viral pathogens involved in shellfish-borne diseases (Table 5 .4). Norovirus infections represent the vast majority of shellfish-related outbreaks, and hepatitis A is the most serious infectious disease caused by shellfish consumption. The United States Food and Drug Administration risk assessments estimate cases of norovirus gastroenteritis related to seafood consumption at some 100,000 per year (Williams & Zorn, 1997) , and epidemics of hepatitis A caused by food occur 10 times more often than those caused by water, shellfish being the cause of more than 50% of reported cases (Cliver, 1985) . Nevertheless, no shellfish-borne outbreak ever had the magnitude of the one reported in Shanghai in 1988, caused by hairy clams (Halliday et al., 1991) .",

Commercial heat treatment (cooking) is employed to reduce the levels of microbial contaminants in shellfish. Heat can render many viruses noninfectious; however the degree of cooking required to reliably inactivate viruses would probably render oysters unpalatable to consumers (McDonnell et al., 1997) . Laboratory studies show that enteric viruses and notably hepatitis A virus may be found in cooked shellfish (Abad et al., 1997) .

In the European Union, these are covered by Council Directive 91/492/EEC (Anonymous, 1991) and in the United States, by interstate trading agreements set out in the Federal Drug Administration National Shellfish Sanitation Program Manual of Operations (Anonymous, 1993) . These regulations cover similar ground on the requirements, among others, for harvesting area classification, depuration, relaying, analytical methods, and provisions for suspension of harvesting from classified areas following a pollution or public health emergency. A major weakness of these controls is the use of traditional bacterial indicators of fecal contamination, such as the fecal coliforms or Escherichia coli, to assess contamination and hence implement the appropriate control measures. Fecal indicators are either measured in the shellfish themselves (EU perspective) or in the shellfish-growing waters (US FDA perspective). However, several reports describe a lack of correlation between bacterial indicator microorganisms and viruses, and pathogenic viruses may be detected in shellfish from areas classified as suitable for commercial exploitation according to fecal coliform criteria (Abad et al., 1997a; Lees, 2000; Le Guyader et al., 2000) . The guidelines establish that shellfish meeting a microbiological standard of less than 230 E. coli or 300 fecal coliforms in 100 g of shellfish flesh can be placed on the market for human consumption. Human enteric viruses, e.g. rotavirus and hepatitis A virus, have been detected in shellfish which were adequate for public consumption according to criteria based on the numbers of bacterial indicators (Jofre et al., 1993; Bosch, et al., 1994; Le Guyader et al., 2000; Romalde et al., 2002) . Additionally, hepatitis A and gastroenteritis outbreaks have been associated with the consumption of shellfish meeting legal standards Le Guyader et al., 1996; Lees, 2000; Mele et al., 1989) .",

More recent studies show that although depuration and relaying procedures may be insufficient to completely remove viruses (Abad et al., 1997a; Lees, 2000; Richards, 1988) , they do contribute to reduce virus levels and hence the risk of infection due to shellfish consumption . Process temperature appears as an important factor for effective virus removal (Dore et al., 1998; Jaykus et al., 1994; Power & Collins, 1990) , although a raise in depuration temperature may result in increased shellfish mortality. Nevertheless, epidemiological evidence reveals that enteric viruses can be transmitted to mankind after consuming shellfish which has been depurated (Gill et al., 1983; Heller et al., 1986; Sockett et al., 1993) . Once again compliance with bacterial end-product standards does not provide a guarantee of virus absence, and bacterial depuration rates cannot accurately predict virus removal rates.",

            "text": "The basic steps of the virological analysis of seawater are sampling, concentration, decontamination/removal of inhibitors, and specific virus detection. Concentration is a particularly critical step since the viruses may be present in such low numbers that concentration of the water samples is indispensable to reduce the volume to be assayed for viruses to a few milliliters or even microliters. A good concentration method should fulfill several criteria: it should be technically simple, fast, provide high virus recoveries, be adequate for a wide range of enteric viruses, provide a small volume of concentrate, and be inexpensive. Table 5 .5 shows a broad selection of currently available and widely employed procedures; some of them require large equipment. Details on virus concentration procedures have been published elsewhere (American Public Health Association, 1998; Environmental Protection Agency, 1984) . In relatively nonpolluted marine waters, the virus levels are likely to be so low that optimally hundreds, or even thousands, of liters should be sampled to increase the probability of virus detection. Nevertheless, all available methodologies have important limitations. The efficiency of a virus concentration method widely depends on the quality of the sampled water. Usually, all available procedures have been basically evaluated in spiked samples, and the recovering efficiencies recorded with experimentally contaminated water dramatically decrease when the method is applied in actual field trials. Additionally, none of the existing concentration procedures has been tested with all the groups of medically important viral pathogens; normally, a few specific enteric viruses have been employed to conduct the evaluation trials. However, some virus concentration methods have been used successfully to recover naturally occurring enteric viruses in seawater (Environmental Protection Agency, 1984; Finance et al., 1982; Gerba & Goyal, 1982; Goyal & Gerba, 1983; Henshilwood et al., 1998; Lewis & Metcalf, 1988; Rao et al., 1986a) . Most of the procedures for concentrating and extracting viruses make use of the properties of the viral proteinaceous macromolecules. Certain protein structures confer on viruses in an aquatic environment the properties of a hydrophilic colloid of an amphoteric nature whose electric charge varies according to the pH and the ionic force of the environment. Viruses can therefore be adsorbed onto and then detach themselves from different substrates which are positively or negatively charged depending on their pH. Methods based on the adsorption of viruses from the sampled water onto a suitable solid surface from which they may be subsequently eluted into a much smaller volume are recommended for their use with largevolume samples.",

However automatic injection systems do exist for treating several hundred liters of water. Virus concentration with electropositive filters may be performed on location, at ambient conditions, without any prior amendment of the sample, which make this procedure most suited for in-field studies, provided that the sample pH is lower than 8.5 (Sobsey & Jones, 1979) .

            "text": "Virus detection in shellfish has to overcome several difficulties. On the one hand, viruses are expected to be present in shellfish in very low numbers, which nevertheless are sufficient to pose a health risk. This low virus load implies the use of methodologies yielding a high efficiency of virus recovery from shellfish tissues. On the other hand, shellfish extracts are both highly cytotoxic and not adequate to be inoculated in cell cultures for the detection of culturable viruses, and not compatible either with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methodologies for the detection of nonculturable viruses, particularly if a reverse transcription must be previously performed (RT-PCR). The key objective is then to develop procedures for shellfish analysis which result in a low volume of a noncytotoxic or, even better nowadays, highly pure nucleic acid preparation with no inhibitory effect to the PCR. As a matter of fact, in this latter case, the degree of virus detection effectiveness achieved after RT-PCR is essentially the result of two related factors: the efficiency of recovery of the extraction procedure applied to the shellfish sample and the degree of final purity of the recovered virus. Table 5 .6 lists different procedures for the processing of shellfish samples prior to the specific virus detection, essentially by molecular procedures since the most relevant shellfishborne viral pathogens are nonculturable. The first decision is to choose between performing virus detection in dissected shellfish tissues or in whole shellfish meats. Studies on the localization of human enteric viruses in shellfish tissues revealed that most of the virus could be found in the stomach and digestive diverticula (Abad et al., 1997a; Romalde et al., 1994) . Atmar and co-workers reasoned that removal of these organs for virus extraction might simplify and shorten the time needed to purify viral nucleic acid for RT-PCR . Testing the stomach and digestive gland for virus detection presented several advantages in comparison Sobsey et al., 1978 Centrifugation Sobsey et al., 1978 Ultracentrifugation Loisy et al., 2000 PEG precipitation Lewis & Metcalf, 1988 Atmar et al., 1995 RNA extraction Guanidium thiocyanate Boom et al., 1990; Lees et al., 1994 Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide Atmar et al., 1995; Jaykus et al., 1994 Commercial nucleic acid extraction kits Loisy et al., 2000; Schwab et al., 2000; Shieh et al., 1999 with testing whole shellfish: less time-consuming procedure, increased test sensitivity, and decrease in the sample-associated interference with RT-PCR. Following virus extraction, a variety of subsequent nucleic acid extraction and purification protocols may be employed (Table 5 .6). Due to the small size of the PCR reaction volumes, a reconcentration step is incorporated prior to the molecular assay. Nucleic acid purification based on virus lysis with guanidine and recovery with a silica matrix (Boom et al., 1990; Lees et al., 1994) , or, alternatively, the use of organic solvents for purification, followed by nucleic acid precipitation using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (Atmar et al., 1995; Jaykus et al., 1994) , remain the procedures of choice. However, a wide variety of commercial kits have been applied for nucleic acid purification, offering reliability combined with convenience (Loisy et al., 2000; Schwab et al., 2000; Shieh et al., 1999) .",

An alternative approach is to employ an antibody capture RT-PCR. This has been applied to detection of hepatitis A virus in seeded shellfish samples and shown to be both sensitive and useful for removal of RT-PCR inhibitors as well (Deng et al., 1994; Graff et al., 1993; L\u00f3pez-Sabater et al., 1997) . Since recognition by a conformationally dependent monoclonal antibody is lost when the particle conformation is altered, coupling of the molecular procedure with capture with this type of antibody may enable to discern between intact and altered virions. This approach may prove useful for other enteric viruses, provided that adequate immunological reagents for the most relevant viral pathogens are available. For this purpose, recombinant virus-like particles, which can be obtained in very high numbers in in vitro expression systems (Crawford et al., 1994; Lawton et al., 1997) , may be employed for the production of antibodies of non culturable viruses.",

However, over the last decade, PCR technology improved on several fronts. On the one hand, commercial PCR systems significantly ameliorated convenience, and have been quickly adopted for diagnostic laboratories. Nevertheless, the most dramatic improvement comes from the emergence of combined rapid thermocycling and fluorescence monitoring of amplified product, collectively referred to as \"rapid-cycling real-time PCR\" (Cockerill, III & Smith, 2002; Gardner et al., 2003; Gassilloud et al., 2003; Kageyama et al., 2003) , together with nucleic-acid-sequence-based amplification or NASBA techniques (Jean et al., 2001; Yates et al., 2001) , both of which are now applicable in several commercially available systems. These procedures enable not only qualitative determination but also, and particularly, quantitative diagnostic assays. Although the generic determination of pathogens is the essence of diagnostic practices, the possibility to quantitatively detect virus agents represents a seminal refinement in routine monitoring virology.",

One major drawback is that current published methods are diverse, complex, poorly standardized, and restricted to a few specialist laboratories. Standardized PCR assays for detection of public health relevant viruses as hepatitis A virus and norovirus are needed to be used in a routine diagnostic context. However, for this purpose, molecular techniques for the virological analysis must put in practice unique or additional quality assurance and quality control requirements to ensure that the data generated are useful and reliable. Some laboratories already have their own internal criteria for quality assurance but a consistent set of quality assurance procedures should be implemented in order to generate data that could be comparable and reliable. A major obstacle for acceptance of molecular techniques by regulatory agencies is in particular a lack of confidence on data generated without adequate controls.",

On the other hand, it is impracticable to monitor the presence of all viral pathogens in the environment. The unreliability of bacterial model mcroorganisms led to the search for alternatives, and several bacteriophage groups appear as promising candidates, among which are somatic coliphages (IAWPRC Study Group on Health Related Water Microbiology, 1991), F+ specific (male-specific), RNA bacteriophages (Havelaar, 1993) , and Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophages (Tartera & Jofre, 1987) , all of them with available ISO (International Standardization Office) procedures for their detection in water. F+ phages in particular have been described as promising candidates to evaluate the virological quality of shellfish (Chung et al., 1998; Lees, 2000) . Several studies have shown a correlation between the elimination kinetics of F+ RNA phages and those of enteric viruses (Dore & Lees, 1995; Power & Collins, 1989 . F+ RNA phages were considered for inclusion in EU legal standards for live bivalve mollusk purification. Nevertheless reports on discrepancies in the occurrences of F+ phages and pathogenic viruses are frequent. In shellfish associated with a large outbreak of hepatitis A reported in the East of Spain in 1999, with 184 serologically confirmed cases, the discrepancy observed between hepatitis A virus and F+ phages was 55%, while a 50% discordance was ascertained between generic enteric virus occurrence and F+ presence . In another study comparing the validity of E. coli, enterovirus, and F+ RNA bacteriophages as indicator microorganisms, the phages failed to predict the risk of viral illness (Miossec et al., 2001) . Additionally, when the comparative positivity for human enteric viruses and F+ RNA phages was investigated in 101 randomly chosen shellfish samples from South and West coast of France, a good correlation between the occurrence of enteric viruses and F+ phages was observed in only 49% of the samples (Le Guyader, unpublished results). Forty one percent of these samples were positive for at least one type of enteric virus but negative for F+ phages, while 11% of the samples were found to be negative for enteric viruses but positive for F+ phages. At the time of publication of this work, F+ RNA phages have been removed from EU standards for shellfish purification.",
