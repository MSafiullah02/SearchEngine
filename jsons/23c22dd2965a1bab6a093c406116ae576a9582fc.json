            "text": "Phage display is one of the most frequently used platform technologies utilized to screen and select therapeutic antibodies, and has contributed to the development of more than 10 therapeutic antibodies used in the clinic. Despite advantages like efficiency and low cost, it has intrinsic technical limitations, such as the asymmetrical amplification of the library after each round of biopanning, which is regarded as a reason for it yielding a very limited number of antigen binders. In this study, we developed a high-throughput single-clonal screening system comprised of fluorescence immunoassays and a laser-driven clonal DNA retrieval system using microchip technology. Using this system, from a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library displayed on phages with a complexity of 5.21 \u00d7 10 5 harboring random mutations at five amino acid residues, more than 70,000 clones-corresponding to~14% of the library complexity-were screened, resulting in 78 antigen-reactive scFv sequences with mutations restricted to the randomized residues. Our results demonstrate that this system can significantly reduce the number of biopanning rounds, or even eliminate the need for this process for libraries with lower complexity, providing an opportunity to obtain more diverse clones from the library.",

Laborious colony picking and the functional testing of individual phage clones restrict the practical screening size to the thousands, which is a fraction of the required level [14] . Even with the help of automated instruments such as colony pickers [15] [16] [17] , the gap between practical and ideal screening capacities cannot be bridged. This necessitates multiple rounds of biopanning, which typically takes weeks. Loss of the best binders is also a critical problem inherent in phage display. Rare binders can be lost due to the strong amplification bias introduced during successive biopanning processes [18, 19] . Furthermore, insufficient elution can cause the loss of strong binders, excluding them from the subsequent steps [20] . The development of an elaborate approach addressing these technical issues is required to minimize labor-intensive work, save considerable time, and reduce the possibility of losing the best binders in the process.",

For phage display applications, various single-cell-level analyses were developed to minimize amplification bias and maximize throughput, thereby reducing the number of biopanning rounds. By employing a microcapillary device with densely packed microreaction chambers, more than one million antibody clones were successfully screened at once [24] . A microfluidic device was also utilized to generate water-in-oil microemulsion reaction chambers, theoretically increasing the analysis throughput to infinite [25, 26] . Although both methods could reduce the number of required biopanning rounds based on their extremely high throughput, they require complicated sample isolation approaches. Furthermore, both methods are vulnerable to possible sample cross-contamination during sample retrieval [27] [28] [29] .",

Then, E. coli cells were allowed to grow, while phages displaying scFvs encoded by the phagemid DNA were rescued. The rescued phages interacted with the antigen-coated surface of the microreaction chamber ( Figure 1A) . A parallel reaction performed in an array of identical microwells enabled library screening at single-cell resolution in a nearly identical environment. The microwell array chip was disassembled into two components ( Figure 1B , microwell array and sample-capturing substrate), which were subjected to different experiments. The microwell array was used for phage fluorescence microwell immunoassays. The microwell array was first washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-M13 antibody. Then, fluorescence images of the microwell array chip were acquired in order to obtain the locations of the AR phage clones ( Figure 1E(ii) ). Next, the AR phage clones were retrieved from the three-layer sample-capturing substrate. The sample-capturing layer was prepared to reliably capture the phages by spin-coating a mixture of vinylmethylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane copolymer; platinum-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane; methylhydrosiloxane-dimethylsiloxane copolymer; and 1,3,5,7-tetravinyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and thermal curing.",

The microwell array was used for phage fluorescence microwell immunoassays. The microwell array was first washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-M13 antibody. Then, fluorescence images of the microwell array chip were acquired in order to obtain the locations of the AR phage clones ( Figure 1E(ii) ). Next, the AR phage clones were retrieved from the three-layer sample-capturing substrate. The sample-capturing layer was prepared to reliably capture the phages by spin-coating a mixture of vinylmethylsiloxanedimethylsiloxane copolymer; platinum-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane; methylhydrosiloxanedimethylsiloxane copolymer; and 1,3,5,7-tetravinyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and thermal curing. The energy-absorbing layer was made of ITO coated on a glass slide. By irradiating with an infrared laser pulse, the sample-capturing layer of the substrate at the depicted location was sheared off by the pressure generated through the vaporization of the energy-absorbing layer and collected into individual wells of the microtiter plate, as depicted in Figure 1C . After phagemid DNA was extracted from the phage, the scFv gene was amplified and subjected to a high-throughput clonal retrieval system as described previously [41] . The retrieved phage clones were used in phage ELISA in order to confirm the antigen reactivity ( Figure 1D ). The energy-absorbing layer was made of ITO coated on a glass slide.

            "text": "In this work, a mutagenesis library with random mutations at five amino acid residues in the heavy-chain variable region was synthesized for deimmunization and subjected to our platform without a preconditioning biopanning process ( Figure 4A ). Using seven microwell array chips, more than 70,000 phage clones were screened, corresponding to~14% of the library diversity. In phage fluorescence microwell immunoassays, 318 microwells (AR hit ratio~0.45%) exhibited distinct fluorescence signals, all of which were subjected to sequencing analysis. After excluding sequences with defective variable chains, codon frameshifts, or low-quality scores, we successfully identified 228 unique scFv clones (total read count~2963). The read counts of the most frequent clone and the second most frequent clone were 1823 and 584, respectively, accounting for 81.2% of the total read count. The recovered scFv clones with unintended mutations or amino acid mismatches, compared to the wild-type clone, were further filtered out, leaving 99 clones. The antigen reactivity of clones was measured using phage ELISA. When the absorbance of the tested clones exceeded the mean plus five standard deviations of that of negative control wells (absorbance \u2265 0.4), we designated the clone as an AR clone. As a result, 78 out of 99 clones (78.8%) were finally confirmed as AR clones with the mutation frequency pattern shown in Figure 4A . The other clones were regarded as false-positive clones, generated by nonspecific binding of the overexpressed low-affinity clones to the antigens within the microwells. When the filtering condition was extended to allow up to two amino acid mismatches on unintended amino acid residues, the number of discovered AR clones increased to 148 ( Figure 4B,C) . Those mismatches could have originated from undesired mutational events introduced by PCR, possibly having no effect on their affinities and thereby increasing the final number of identified AR clones. Among the additional 70 AR clones obtained, 47 were indeed found to have exactly the same mutation pattern, with one of those perfectly matched to the wild-type clone. Two residues in HCDR1 and three residues in HFR3 were randomized from the wild-type clone. (B) Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for the identification of scFv clones as well as valid mutations. (C) Representative monoclonal phage ELISA result. The arrow indicates a wild-type clone. Each bar represents the absorbance value against hFc fusion protein (negative control, black), anti-HA antibody (positive control, blue), and CD28 fusion protein (target, red), respectively.",
