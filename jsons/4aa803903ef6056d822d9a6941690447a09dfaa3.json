We also included a retrospective comparison group of patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) without COVID-19 from the same hospital. In addition, we performed additional analysis in a previously published population of ICU patients from Lille University Hospital, CHU Lille, Roger Salengro (Lille, France). 1 The population included all adult (\u226518 years old) inpatients from Lyon University Hospital who were currently hospitalised on March 27, 2020, and had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance. 2 Lyon University Hospital has set up specific COVID-19 departments to which all patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis by RT-PCR of COVID-19 or with as strong clinical and imaging suspicion of COVID-19 were transferred. All patients in this department were included except pregnant women.",

Briefly, 200 \u00b5l of respiratory samples were inactivated in 400 \u00b5l of cobas omni LYS buffer for 10 min before testing (Roche Diagnostics France). SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was performed using the qualitative assay cobas SARS-CoV-2 kit on the cobas 6800 system as recommended by manufacturer's instructions (Roche diagnostics France). This technique targets the ORF1a nonstructural gene, specific for the SARS-CoV-2 detection and the structural envelope E-gene, detecting pan-Sarbecovirus including SARS-CoV-2.",
