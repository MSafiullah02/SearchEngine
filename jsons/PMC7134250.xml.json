To this end, previous work has studied several website design characteristics, including their effectiveness and visual appeal [1\u20134]. Daily, we visit numerous websites or use their applications, and our evaluations are affected by their usability, how they look and feel, as well as their content and service quality [5]. Since website design will influence user experience, designers and the companies they work for strive to offer aesthetically pleasing websites of high quality. The majority of the studies in the area employ subjective methods (e.g., data collection using questionnaires), while some utilize more objective approaches by collecting physiological data such as fMRI and eye-tracking [6, 7].",

Going beyond heatmaps, eye-tracking techniques can offer deeper insight into users\u2019 gaze behavior as they can also capture how one\u2019s eyes move during the whole period, including for example speed of eye movement, a change in direction, switching between two spots [14, 15].",

Earlier studies suggest that first impressions are formed very fast when users visit at a website, in the very first seconds [16]. Thus, when taking design decisions different aspects that grab one\u2019s attention are more likely to influence their perceptions on visual aesthetics. However, as users become more experienced their perceptions regarding visual aesthetics are likely to evolve as well [15]. Indeed, eye-tracking data show that the more a user fixates on certain elements in a website the more likely it is to find it less appealing [14], which may occur if users start looking into more details as they look at the website. This raises the question if and how fast we can predict users\u2019 perceptions on visual aesthetics while they are looking at a website. Thus, we formulate the following research question: RQ: How fast can we predict users\u2019 ratings when judging visual aesthetics in websites in terms of simplicity, diversity, colorfulness, and craftsmanship?",

Then, we employ machine learning techniques to predict users\u2019 ratings from the gaze behavior and test how fast we can get an accurate prediction with a low error. We conducted an experiment in which users were asked to look at websites and then rate them in terms of simplicity, diversity, colorfulness, craftsmanship. The experiment included websites that ranged from low, neutral, and high visually appealing. We contribute by showing that when examining users\u2019 first impressions towards a website more than a few seconds are needed to get an accurate and valuable estimate on their perceptions towards the website\u2019s visual appeal. This is a first step towards designing and developing AI applications that will track users\u2019 eyes only for a specific amount of time (i.e., the time needed to get an accurate estimate) and inform designers about users\u2019 perceptions on visual aesthetics.",

Capturing such evaluations for websites is highly important for website designers and can be done by examining screen design factors and layout elements which are related with users\u2019 perceptions of visual aesthetics [3]. To measure perceptions on visual aesthetics studies commonly use questionnaires which introduce a subjective take on the matter. Visual aesthetics can be divided into two basic types [4]. First, there are classical aesthetics that describe websites that are clear, well organized, and pleasant. Then, there are expressive aesthetics which refer to websites that are creative, colorful, and original.",

In detail, this measure includes four dimensions, or facets of visual aesthetics, which are simplicity, diversity, colorfulness, and craftsmanship. Simplicity, part of the classical aesthetics, refers to website design regarding its unity, clarity, orderliness and balance. Next, diversity, part of the expressive aesthetics, refers to a website design having a dynamic, novel, and creative design. For a more holistic representation of visual aesthetics the measure was extended by adding colorfulness and craftsmanship, adopted from Lavie and Tractinsky [4]. The unique effect of colors as well as the skillful and coherent integration of all design dimensions can be evaluated [1, 2]. The present study adopts the four facets of visual aesthetics as they are considered to be more detailed by examining more aspects of aesthetics [2]. This approach enables a better and deeper understanding of perceived visual aesthetics.",

Indeed, we can collect data on where exactly the user looks when browsing a website and also how they look at it. The manner we look at an object is related with how we process and think about that object [18]. Our aesthetical preferences can be predicted with the derivatives of the stimulus properties [11, 19, 20]. Furthermore, based on the eye-mind hypothesis [18], what a user looks at indicates their cognitive process. These two notions can be simply described as \u201cwhat you perceive is what you see\u201d and \u201cwhat you see is what you process\u201d. Thus, cognitive load theory has been used to explain gaze behavior and how we process what we see [21], supporting the eye-mind hypothesis [18].

In detail, we use eye-tracking measures and compute their respective features as a proxy for users perceived visual aesthetics, to examine how looking at websites explains perceptions of visual appeal. Previous studies have employed eye-tracking techniques to predict website design characteristics and users\u2019 visual attention [11, 13, 21, 23]. Nonetheless, previous studies mainly focus on using heat maps to explain eye behavior, which although is useful to show where the user focused, but it does not provide any information on how his or her eyes moved while looking at the website and interacting with it. Here we combine information from gaze behavior and questionnaires to predict users\u2019 ratings and extend previous studies by examining how fast can we get an accurate prediction.",

For this, we use the top-100 popular websites, based on the ranks on Alexa.com (i.e., provider of global traffic estimates in different categories). Fifty e-commerce websites were selected randomly, and 10 HCI experts were asked to evaluate them in terms of visual appeal on a 7-point scale. Amazon websites were removed from the list as Alexa is owned by Amazon to avoid any potential bias. Based on the median score from experts\u2019 ratings, nine websites were chosen, creating 3 categories, that is high, neutral and low visually appealing, with 3 websites each. Figure 1 shows examples from each category. A key distinction among the homepages of these websites is the photo-text ration, a main design characteristic in visually appealing websites [2, 11]. Since the first impression of a webpage is formed right away, as soon as one visits it, [16], investigating users\u2019 eye-tracking behavior on those very first seconds that they look at a webpage is important and can prove beneficial in explaining how behavior relates to main factors of visual aesthetics and design.\n",

Since, simplicity is calculated based on the sum of 5 items (Appendix), it means that per item, the 11% error translates to a 0.66 (i.e., 3.3/5) deviance on the Likert Scale. Thus, the accuracy of our predictions is quite high and can be deviant by approximately half point or less on the Likert scale.",

Furthermore, the findings show that 10 s are not sufficient to make a good enough prediction, compared to 25 s, and the error rate goes up to 16% and 17%, for simplicity and colorfulness.

We empirically show that in website aesthetic evaluation a user has to look at a website for 15 s or more depending on which facet of visual aesthetics is of interest. The fact that diversity and craftmanship need more time to be predicted (longer interaction lengths) can be explained by the fact that a more diverse website is likely to increase interest and attention of the users [2, 3], making them look for details and spend more time looking at it. Similarly, for craftmanship, users may need to look at the website more carefully, thus need more time, in order to make judgements if a website is well built and of high quality.",

Drawing on recent discussion in HCI on how machine learning and AI can improve the field [8] as well as to be used to improve image [9] and website aesthetics [10], we offer empirical evidence on how the process of predicting users\u2019 preferences can be automated. The findings pave the way to design new systems that will take into account users\u2019 gaze behavior in an unobtrusive manner and will be able inform researchers and designers about their perceptions of visual aesthetics. An AI application or an intelligent agent may compute in real time the probability for a user to find a website high or low appealing, which in turn may be used as feedback to improve design. Furthermore, building on previous studies showing that users\u2019 gaze is related both with their perceptions and cognitive processing [18, 19], we provide empirical evidence that gaze behavior is linked to perceptions towards the same stimuli.",

As technology evolves, eye-tracking devices are becoming cheaper and accessible to larger audiences. At the same time, machine learning and AI have evolved at a level where we see their applications in our daily lives, and with automated machine learning (AutoML) practitioners can more easily develop such new applications. For example website retailers can use eye tracking or even users\u2019 own mobiles phones to evaluate websites [35]. By knowing how quickly we can predict users\u2019 ratings, a developer can design an application that will request to track users\u2019 eye behavior only for the first 15 or 20 s of using the application. This could serve as a middle ground, where the company will get important data to improve their application and users\u2019 data will be recorded at a minimum level, making it more likely for users to accept and share their data. This can be combined with knowledge on gaze behavior, as they can show accurately which parts of a website were more or less important (e.g., high fixation on specific areas or high saccade velocity between two areas) and how that relates to their ratings regarding aesthetics. Thus, if we can predict high ratings on simplicity then we can automatically identify which areas created this perception to the user.",
