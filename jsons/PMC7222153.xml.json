The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2018, representing all literature published since the release of the seminal review from Millett et al. in 2007 that identified network factors as possible drivers of racial disparities in HIV.",

This difference by race was seen both in older MSM and young MSM (YMSM) and was consistent across studies in various US cities. In one study it was found that greater density amongst members of a social network was associated with lower rates of serodiscordant condomless intercourse (SDCI) with a non-primary partner, an effect that did not differ by race/ethnicity [19].

Similarly, for YMSM in Chicago, no association was found between size or density of sexual networks and CAI [23]. Structural characteristics of social and sexual networks are inconsistent predictors of sexual risk behavior. The structure of social networks is more salient to behavior than the structure of sexual networks, and network factors manifest differently across racial/ethnic groups.",

Studies varied in how they measured social support, although most either measured general social support, or measured specific subdomains of social support (i.e. emotional, instrumental, informational, appraisal) [24]. Two studies included measures of \u201cHIV-related\u201d social support [15, 20]. Most studies measured perceived social support (i.e. a personal belief that social support is available and adequate) [25], although one study measured enacted social support [26]. The majority of the studies measured network-wide social support, but three studies used an actor-specific measure of social support where support from individual network members was assessed [20, 26, 27]. General perceived social support within a network was associated with lower rates of CAI [17, 28, 29] as was a measure of actor-specific HIV-related social support [20]. Lauby et al. [29] found that the relationship between general perceived social support within a network and HIV infection in their study was partially explained by changes in CAI. The direct impact of perceived social support on HIV incidence was explored in one notable prospective cohort study of BMSM in six major US cities, which found that having more people in one\u2019s emotional support network, medical support network, and social participation support network were all protective against seroconversion during the study period [27].",

The findings suggest that size and density of sexual networks may be less influential than the size and density of social networks, that social support plays a protective role regarding HIV risk, and that racially homophilous networks with high HIV prevalence are linked to disparities in HIV. In addition to network factors, psychosocial factors and structural factors were also found to be involved in determining HIV risk and were often studied alongside network factors. This review highlights the importance of studying network characteristics in understanding racial disparities in the HIV epidemic. Where individual behavioral factors fail to explain disparities, network factors and their antecedent structural factors emerge as key drivers of sexual risk behavior and racial disparities in HIV incidence.",

While a great deal of research has measured structural characteristics of networks such as size and density, the relationship between these structural network factors and HIV risk and disparities is not clear. Little evidence was found to suggest the structure of sexual networks was highly predictive of HIV risk, and the relationship between the structure of social networks and risk was complicated. Of note, we discovered that social network size had different effects on CAI in BMSM and Latino MSM samples. We believe this may be attributed to the different relationships that Black and Latino men might have to the mainstream gay community. Patterns of racism in the MSM community, including racialized sexual stereotypes [40], may lead to Latino MSM finding greater support within this community, while BMSM may experience alienation or discrimination. Thus, as we consider the role of social networks in HIV risk among MSM, it is important to acknowledge varying effects that may be experienced among racial/ethnic minority groups. While basic structural characteristics such as size and density should still be measured, future research that measures more complex measures of network position, such as bridging [41], could offer additional insight into how networks affect HIV risk.",

Additionally, there was evidence that this relationship was partially mediated by the effect of social support on sexual risk behavior. One of the few prospective cohort studies reviewed found a direct relationship between social support and decreased seroconversion [34]. These findings are compelling because they reveal the influence of social support on HIV risk, as well as suggesting sexual risk behavior as a potential mechanism by which this effect operates. Several evidence-based interventions for racial/ethnic minority MSM have been described that leverage social networks to influence behavior change (e.g. Many Men, Many Voices and d-up: Defend Yourself! [42, 43]), but little is known about the effects of these interventions at the network level. Research and intervention development should focus on evaluating their impact on network-level characteristics (e.g., changes in size, density, heterogeneity) and its mechanisms of change (e.g., increased availability of social support), alongside HIV outcomes, in an effort to inform strategies that address racial disparities in HIV.",

This suggests that network viral load may be a more salient measure of HIV risk within a network than network HIV prevalence. Assessing network viral load also has several advantages over community viral load, another common measurement of aggregated viral activity [44].

In fact, seeking to address racial homophily without mitigating the structural forces that have historically shaped these networks (e.g. racism, segregation) will be insufficient [45, 46]. Additionally, focusing on racial homophily as a risk factor for HIV risks pathologizing love and connection among communities of color [47].

            "text": "This review had several limitations. First, by limiting our review to studies that used quantitative measurement of network factors, we may miss important insights from foundational qualitative work. Second, our review was limited in scope. We only examined research that had an explicit focus on racial/ethnic disparities with individual-level outcomes in order to address our research question efficiently. As a result, our review excludes some network research (e.g., stochastic network modeling studies; see Fujimoto et al. for exemplar study) [52] that informs racial/ethnic HIV disparities. Additionally, the majority of the reviewed studies employed a cross-sectional study design, limiting our ability to draw conclusions about causation. Finally, there are inherent limitations to the egocentric (information derived solely from participant) network designs used by most studies in this review. Sociometric designs (information derived from all members of network), while more costly and burdensome, offer a more robust measurement of social and sexual networks. Future research should aim to measure complete networks over time in order to better understand how the dynamics of social and sexual networks effect HIV risk and disparities.",

The existing literature supports a multilevel model of HIV risk that implicates factors at the individual, network, and structural levels in creating and propagating racial disparities. Structural, functional, and compositional characteristics of networks have all been linked to HIV risk behaviors or racial disparities, suggesting that networks play a key role in shaping these outcomes. Development of intervention and policy should look beyond individual level behavior change. Research and intervention that focuses on factors at the network and structural levels to effectively address racial disparities in HIV are needed. These higher-level factors, which require cultural and economic shifts, may address the fundamental causes of these disparities and hold the potential to affect lasting change.",
