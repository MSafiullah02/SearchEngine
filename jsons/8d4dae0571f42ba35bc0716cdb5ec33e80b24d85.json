            "text": "z Is Severe Sepsis a Disease of the Elderly? Unlike many disease processes, sepsis occurs across all age groups. However, there is a clearly documented rise in its incidence with increasing age. An abrupt decline occurs after the neonatal period, after which the incidence of sepsis increases steadily throughout adulthood (Fig. 1 ). Angus et al. reported the annual incidence of severe sepsis across all age groups to be 3.0 cases per 1000 population [1] . The incidence rises dramatically with age such that in those over 85 years of age sepsis occurs annually at a rate of 26.2 per 1000 population. Martin et al. analyzed data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and similarly reported the annual incidence of sepsis to be 2.4 per 1000 population [3] . Their data indicate that the average age of patients with sepsis is increasing over time. Nearly two-thirds of patients with sepsis each year are over 65 years of age [1] .",

These include co-morbid illnesses, exposure to instrumentation and procedures, institutionalization, malnutrition, and poor performance status [11\u00b114]. Significantly higher rates of co-morbidities \u00b1 e.g., hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, and recent surgery \u00b1 were noted in those over 75 years of age compared to younger patients in a recent sepsis trial [11] . Those over age 65 in another sepsis study were twice as likely to have at least one co-morbid medical condition as younger sepsis patients [15] . Management of such conditions often necessitates instrumentation (urinary catheters, tracheotomies, and central venous catheters, etc.) that compromises the natural barriers of innate immunity and creates a portal of entry for infection. Additionally, up to one-third of patients older than 80 reside in long-term care facilities where bacterial flora demonstrate a higher level of resistance than that seen in the community [12, 16] . Institutionalization is associated with oropharyngeal colonization with Gram-negative bacilli, and this, combined with depressed cough and mucociliary transport function, leads to increased rates of nosocomial pneumonia [13] . Additionally, malnutrition is commonplace in the elderly as a result of inactivity, poor mobility, functional limitation, poor or restricted diets, chronic disease, dementia, depression, poor dentition, and polypharmacy [14] .",

As a result of this endothelial damage, tissue factor is expressed, and the tissue factor-dependent clotting cascade is activated, resulting in the formation of thrombin such that microaggregates of fibrin, platelets, neutrophils, and red blood cells impair capillary blood flow, decreasing oxygen and nutrient delivery [18] .",

Levels of TNF-a were significantly higher in septic patients over 80 years of age than in younger septic patients in one study [19] , and increased concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules \u00b1 markers for activated or damaged endothelium \u00b1 have been observed in older septic patients compared to younger septic patients [20] . Additionally, the monocytes of healthy elderly adults demonstrate increased intracellular levels of TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6 [21] , and increasing age is associated with rising circulating levels of IL-6 and D-dimer [22] , activated Factor VII, and other coagulation factors [23] , indicating activation of inflammatory and coagulation pathways even in the absence of acute illness (Fig. 2) . Age-related increased levels of clotting factors \u00b1 particularly Factor VII, Factor VIII and fibrinogen \u00b1 and impaired fibrinolysis from excess plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 produce a propensity towards thrombus formation. The impaired ability to effectively clear neoantigens and the progressive, low-grade inflammation that accompanies aging leads to inefficient clearance of microbes and excess cytokine and chemokine synthesis. The bi-directional interactions between fibrin generation and inflammation adversely affect the microcirculation in older patients with sepsis. Thrombin activates leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells via protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), upregulating IL-6, IL-8, platelet activating factor (PAF), and P selectin synthesis. Neutrophils and monocytes bind to fibrin, fibrinogen, and P-selectin by Pselectin glyoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Activated myeloid cells express the pattern recognition molecules CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). The innate inflammatory reaction upregulates tissue factor expression and suppresses endogenous anticoagulant activity promoting further thrombus propagation z What Challenges are Associated with the Diagnosis of Sepsis in Older Patients?",

As such, a careful evaluation for signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [24] is essential, keeping in mind that the frequency of these signs in sepsis is altered by increased age. For example, fever may be blunted or absent in older patients with infection. In one study, fever was absent in 25 (13%) of 192 bacteremic patients 65 years of age and older compared to only 5 (4%) of 128 patients less than 65 years (p < 0.01) [25] . Another study found that half of the elderly patients evaluated had a blunted fever response to infection (< 38.3 8C), but one-quarter of these patients had a significant change in temperature above a low baseline [26] . Additionally, while the incidences of tachycardia and hypoxemia were significantly lower among septic patients over age 75 compared to younger patients in one large study, tachypnea and altered mental status were more common in the older group [27] . Confusion or altered mental status, best thought of as delirium [28] or septic encephalopathy [29] , is noted to occur in the majority of septic patients [28] ; therefore, clinicians must be aware of such nonspecific clinical expressions of infection in the elderly.

Diagnostic studies directed at identifying the source of infection should be performed without delay when possible (Grade E), and source control measures should be instituted early when necrotic skin, lung, or other tissues; abscesses or empyemas; infected devices; or infected catheters are identified (Grade E). Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated within one hour of recognition of sepsis (Grade E) after cultures have been taken from the blood and other suspected sites of infection (Grade D). As inadequate initial antibiotic therapy is independently associated with poor outcomes across age groups [32, 33] , initial empiric therapy should be broad, having activity against all probable pathogens (Grade D). This is particularly important in older patients, as co-morbid illnesses, immunocompromised states, residence in nursing homes, repeated hospitalizations, and the increased prevalence of intra-abdominal and soft tissue infections increase the likelihood of repeated antimicrobial exposure [34] . This increases the propensity of older patients to accumulate multidrug-resistant microbial flora, necessitating a broader spectrum of empiric antibiotics. As such, rapid reduction to monotherapy active against causative organisms, once identified, should be the standard approach to antibiotic therapy in older patients with sepsis [30] .",

Knaus et al. studied 58 737 patients and reported that increasing age was independently associated with a higher 28-day mortality, yet the association between increasing severity of illness and mortality appeared to be much stronger [55] . Gogos et al. prospectively evaluated 139 patients with severe sepsis and reported that age was an independent predictor of poor outcome [56] . However, other investigators have found that mortality rates for critically ill older and younger patients are similar after controlling for co-morbidities and severity of illness [32] . In a recent study of 406 patients with sepsis, age was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality on univariate analysis, but on multivariate analysis this association was no longer seen [33] . Multivariate analyses in studies evaluating patients with Pseudomonas bacteremia [57] and Gram-negative bacteremia [58] also failed to show that age was independently associated with mortality due to sepsis.",

Advanced age profoundly alters the function of the immune system, accelerating the risk of infection and severe sepsis in older patients. High rates of co-morbid illness, instrumentation, institutionalization, and malnutrition further contribute to the markedly increased incidence of severe sepsis in the elderly population. Alterations in the pathophysiology of sepsis may be responsible, in part, for the increase in mortality due to severe sepsis associated with advanced age. However, despite the rising incidence and significant mortality of sepsis in older patients many elderly patients respond remarkably well to the evidence-based diagnostic and management strategies reviewed here. Ongoing research is evaluating other promising sepsis-specific treatments. Additional studies are needed to investigate important issues such as post-discharge survival and health-related quality of life in older patients after severe sepsis.",

Age-related increased levels of clotting factors \u00b1 particularly Factor VII, Factor VIII and fibrinogen \u00b1 and impaired fibrinolysis from excess plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 produce a propensity towards thrombus formation. The impaired ability to effectively clear neoantigens and the progressive, low-grade inflammation that accompanies aging leads to inefficient clearance of microbes and excess cytokine and chemokine synthesis. The bi-directional interactions between fibrin generation and inflammation adversely affect the microcirculation in older patients with sepsis. Thrombin activates leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells via protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), upregulating IL-6, IL-8, platelet activating factor (PAF), and P selectin synthesis. Neutrophils and monocytes bind to fibrin, fibrinogen, and P-selectin by Pselectin glyoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Activated myeloid cells express the pattern recognition molecules CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). The innate inflammatory reaction upregulates tissue factor expression and suppresses endogenous anticoagulant activity promoting further thrombus propagation",
