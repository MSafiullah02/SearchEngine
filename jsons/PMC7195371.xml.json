Malaysia reported its\u2019 first confirmed case on 25 January 2020. This was a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, who had travelled from Singapore to Johor Bahru on 22 January 2020. There were only 22 positive cases during the first wave, of which all were discharged well. Following 11 days of zero reported case, the second wave of outbreak started on February 27, with a surge to 553 positive cases by March 16. These cases were related to the Tabligh gathering cluster, held at Sri Petaling from 27 February to 3 March 2020, which was attended by approximately 16,000 people.2 To reduce the spread of infection, the Malaysian government decided to implement a nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) effective from 18 March 2020 to 31 March 2020. After 2 weeks of enforcement of the MCO, new cases continued to increase with occasional plateauing, hence the MCO was extended from 1st April until 28th April 2020. Since the implementation of the MCO, all public hospitals in Malaysia have implemented changes at all level, aimed to conserve the limited resources for the battle against this pandemic.",

The cancelled elective cases were screened and triaged by the consultants. Patients who really require surgery especially oncological cases were admitted and posted as semi-emergency surgery. The limited ICU beds and ventilators are some of our major challenges to proceed with most of these semi-emergency surgeries. Emergency surgeries such as ureteric stenting for obstructive uropathy, scrotal exploration, trauma surgery continued during this period. The MOH issued a guideline which instructed all patients to undergo COVID-19 diagnostic tests via RT-PCR prior surgery with nasopharyngeal or throat swabs. The Urology MOs received training to take the swabs via online video using Zoom and small group training by our microbiology colleagues. In dire emergent situations where the COVID-19 status cannot be ascertained within limited time, the surgery will proceed with enhanced precautions as per COVID-positive cases. In order to ensure faster surgery (to prevent unnecessary waste of OT time) and minimize OT personnel to conserve resources like PPE, only consultant or specialist performed the surgery. Hence, the surgical skills training for trainees had significantly reduced during this period.",

Catching up and clearing these backlogs will be a challenging task not only to our department but all the affected public hospitals in Malaysia. With 1.5 month of MCO, on a rough estimation, we have lost approximately 240 hours of daycare procedure and 180 hours of elective OT time. We have postponed about 1560 clinic appointments to later dates (1-6 months). This means that over the next 6 months, on top of the existing scheduled cases, we have to increase our resources to cater for: (1) 40 hours/month for daycare (2) 30 hours/month for elective surgery (3 full days\u2019 list) and (3) 65 outpatient consultations/week. The additional elective OT time will be challenging as we will have to compete with the other surgical disciplines. All these will ultimately cause more stress to our overburdened elective surgery list (e.g. average waiting time for PCNL is about 12 months). And if the MCO is going to be extended further, the burden will increase proportionally. In addition, the negative economical impact to many in the middle-class will eventually diverts more patients to the government-subsidized public hospitals, and further increasing stress to the already overburdened health system.",
