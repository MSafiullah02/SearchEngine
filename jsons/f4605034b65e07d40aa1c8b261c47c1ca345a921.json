The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) along with other sources reports the number of persons traveling by air to be more than 2.5-3.2 billion worldwide every year, with an estimated 5% of travelers experiencing a chronic illness [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although air travel is quite safe from a technical point of view, passengers are increasingly at risk during flight due to individual health problems [5] . Although air travel is growing safer and more comfortable, the increasing average age of passengers, heightened security, and stress surrounding flights and schedules, combined with the unique environment of airplanes with changes in cabin temperature, air pressure and humidity levels, narrow seats, and frequent flight delays, may result in adverse medical conditions during flights [6] . Combined with the rising number of passengers and increased capacity of larger aircraft with more long-distance domestic and international flights [2, 7] , with long-haul aircraftssuch as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 LR now capable of extending flight times to 18-20 h-it is likely that the incidence of in-flight medical emergencies will continue to increase in the coming years [3] . International air travel in particular combines long-haul, extended flight times with unique exposures, and an even more austere, secluded environment for passengers with acute and/or chronic illnesses, and suggests unique medical challenges for recognition, stabilization, treatment, diagnosis, and disposition.",

Various prevalence data sources exist but most have been derived from individual airlines. In 1999, British Airways reported about one in-flight medical incident per 11,000 passengers [18] . A 2000 UK Government report indicated that the number can be as high as 1 in 1,400 passengers, and a study of a ground-based communications center that provides medical consultative service to airlines estimated that medical emergencies occur in 1 of every 604 flights [4, 17] . Estimates of medical events requiring professional intervention were thought to be about 1 per 14,000 passengers [19] . These data are an average of short-haul and long-haul flights; given the reduced time on the plane with short-haul flights, and the decreased likelihood of passengers seeking help when they are closer to their destination, medical events are likely to be higher than this estimate on long-haul, international flights. In most cases, the incidence of IMEs is likely to increase with the continued growth in air travel, with the gradual aging of the traveling population, and with people with preexisting disease traveling by air, and as airlines continue to reduce prices by reducing seat sizes and increasing passenger numbers [20] .",

The reliance of airlines on volunteer medical assistance combines with several other issues: inadequate space and seating for passengers, inadequate space to provide proper and adequate medical care, inadequate training of crew members, inadequate medical equipment, and inadequate or unclear laws pertaining to volunteer providers, crew members, airlines, and patients, especially on international flights crossing state and national borders and airline ownership; all these combine to increase difficulties of medical stabilization, treatment, diagnosis, and disposition, and even more so on long-haul, international flights [21] .",

Generally, there is high risk for VTE only in flights of more than 8 h [38] and the risk of VTE usually occurs only in flights of more than 4 h [6, 33].",

A physician who provides assistance creates a doctor-patient relationship, with its attendant obligations and liability risk. Most doctors are eager to help in an emergency but are concerned that doing so might put them at risk; however, there have been numerous \"Good Samaritan\" laws enacted to protect healthcare professionals who respond in emergency situations. In 1998, Congress enacted the US Aviation Medical Assistance Act, which outlines protection for physicians and airlines who provide emergency medical care for passengers on commercial airliners, provided that the physician acts in good faith, receive no monetary compensation, provide reasonable care, and does not \"grossly neglect\" the patient or commit \"willful misconduct.\" An example of such disregard would be an intoxicated physician treating a patient [46] . Furthermore, many airlines indemnify volunteering physicians, and the captain should provide written confirmation on request [3, 11] . In addition, the insurance policies of many airlines cover healthcare professionals who provide emergency medical care to passengers or crew while on board their aircraft [46] . The situation is a bit more complicated for medical professionals traveling on an international flight, however, as he or she becomes subject to the laws of the country in which the airline is registered. These laws may differ significantly from those of the United States. New Zealand, for example, requires that medically qualified persons respond to a medical emergency, and failure to do so is grounds for legal action [46, 47] .",
