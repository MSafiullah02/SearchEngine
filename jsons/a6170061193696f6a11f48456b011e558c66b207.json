            "text": "SARS-CoV-2', a novel coronavirus and the cause of COVID-19, was isolated in December 2019 and has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The vast and rapid spread of COVID-19 calls for immediate action from policy-makers and in many countries, various lockdown measures were implemented. Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyse the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,003,298 surveys were filled up to date. We used a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Ratio (SR), defined as a weighted mean of symptoms found to be prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15th and April 22nd, the mean SR sharply declined by 78.9%, as did every individual symptom, including our most common symptoms of cough and rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, which decreased from 14.5% and 13.8% of the survey responders, respectively, to 2.4% and 2.5%. We also observed reduction in symptoms separately in the vast majority of cities in Israel. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including Analysis source code is available at https://github.com/hrossman/Covid19-Survey . Source code for the questionnaires is available at https://github.com/hasadna/avid-covider as an open source project, and can be readily adapted to use in other countries.",

In Israel, the first infection of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 21st 2020, and in response, the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) employed a series of steps in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus in Israel. These steps were gradually aggravated; on March 9th all Israelis returning from abroad were instructed to begin a 14-day home-isolation period upon their arrival; on March 11th gatherings were limited to a maximum of 100 people; on March 12th educational institutions were closed; on March 25th new regulations instructed Israeli citizens to remain in their homes, with permission to leave only to a distance of 100 meters; and on March 31th the above regulations were further exacerbated forbidding any gatherings of people from different households. Policy changes in Israel thus far were enforced on the entire Israeli population. In several cities with high infection rates, stricter regulations were implemented. April imposed new challenges for the Israeli population and the government, given the Jewish holiday Passover which is traditionally celebrated with family. To prevent gatherings during the holiday period, between April 8th and 15th, harsher restrictions were imposed, with a national quarantine declared on the eve of Passover. On April 19th, a few of the restrictions were lifted and more employees were allowed to return to work and limited social events such as prayers and weddings were allowed to take place but under severe restrictions on the numbers of people.",

In the absence of a vaccine against COVID-19, control of disease spreading through large-scale physical distancing measures appears to be an effective means of mitigation ( 1 ) . These may include closures of workplaces, schools, and general lockdown. While many countries have implemented different policies and various degrees of lockdowns ( 1 -3 ) , the effect of these measures on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the general population has not been quantified to date. Here, we utilize data obtained from nationwide, daily, one minute surveys, deployed by us from the early stages of COVID-19 spread in Israel 3 , to analyse the effect of different actions implemented in Israel on the prevalence of different clinical symptoms and at high geographical resolution.",

In order to measure the effect of the Israeli lockdown policy on a single measure which takes into account the prevalence of symptoms which were described as common in patients with COVID-19 infection to date, we used a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Ratio (SR), defined as a weighted mean of symptoms that were described as prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Due to the fact that in many countries, only symptomatic individuals are being tested, the true prevalence of symptoms in individuals positive to COVID-19 remains unclear and to date was reported only in a small scale study ( 6 ) . We therefore calculated this measure based on two different sets of weights. SRt (targeted) was calculated by the overall prevalence of symptoms in confirmed patients (Zhao et al. 2020 ). In these patients, most diagnostic tests were most likely targeted. SRs (screening) was based on the prevalence of symptoms in confirmed patients diagnosed by screening tests (Gudbjartsson et al. 2020 ) (see Section 2 in the Supplementary information). These unified measures were designed to be as informative as possible and to serve as the best possible indicator for reporting of coronavirus related symptoms. We included only symptoms that were reported to have a prevalence of more than 2% in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Symptom weights were defined as their reported prevalence in these patients, divided by the sum of the total list of symptoms prevalence (see Section 2 in the Supplementary information). This measure aims to reflect the importance of each symptom with respect to its appearance in confirmed cases. The symptoms included for adults were fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and diarrhea. Rhinorrea was only included in the SRs.",

Next, we calculated the prevalence of the various clinical symptoms reported by the responders throughout the study period, and analysed the effect of different policy changes implemented by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Israel during this time period (Figure 1 ). Of note, data obtained from the Israeli MOH on Influenza like symptoms in Israel from previous years revealed a very low rate of influenza like illness in the time period which is parallel to the time in which our survey has been distributed, with less than 1 weekly clinic visit due to influenza like symptoms per 10,000 people, across all age groups ( 7 ) . Our analysis revealed a significant reduction in the prevalence of nearly all symptoms (except nausea and vomiting) as physical distancing policies became more strict. The largest reduction was observed in confusion and muscle pain, which decreased by 85.36% and 84.58%, respectively, from March 15 to April 21. We also observed a reduction of 78.9% and 77.63% in our aggregated symptom measures SRt and SRs, respectively (Figure 1) . Notably, the rate of responses to the survey changes over time (Figure 1 ), but at least 10,000 responses were received every day. Thus, the decrease in all reported symptoms is probably not a result of lacking reports, but of a true trend of symptoms reduction.",

This is supported by the fact that the decrease in the prevalence of symptoms is global, and is not limited to specific symptoms which were described as common in individuals with COVID-19 infection. In addition, while the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 infection in the Israeli population is increasing (14,326 on April 22nd), it still represents a small fraction (0.16%) of the Israeli population ( 8 ) and is unlikely to be the sole contributor to the large decrease in symptoms visible in our data. Many infectious diseases other than COVID-19 are transmitted by Aerosol transmission ( 9 ) or physical contact ( 10 ) , which are greatly reduced when implementing physical distance measures, and will be therefore affected by these measures as well. For example, a previous study found a decrease of 42% in the overall diagnoses of respiratory infections in children during school closure as part of an organized labor dispute during a previous influenza outbreak ( 11 ) .",

We believe that this is not the case, since we started distributing our survey in the middle of March, when according to the Israeli Ministry of Health, the levels of infection caused by Influenza were already extremely low. Furthermore, data on Influenza like symptoms in Israel from previous years suggest a very low rate of influenza like illness in the time of year in which our survey was distributed (with less than 1 weekly clinic visit due to influenza like symptoms per 10,000 people) ( 7 ) .",

As such, we cannot link daily surveys of the same responder, which could have provided symptoms trends at the individual level and insights on the progression of symptoms and the disease over time, and the influence of lockdown policies on the progression of symptoms at the individual level. At the time of writing, we are deploying newer versions of our survey that will be distributed nationally in Israel, allowing us not only to collect data which will be more representative but also to link responses of an individual over time, while protecting the anonymity and privacy of the responders.",

In an attempt to reduce this bias, the survey was distributed in six different languages to reflect the most common languages spoken in Israel and substantial efforts were made to reach disadvantaged populations by engaging leaders in local religious communities, and promoting the survey through both Hebrew and Arabic-speaking media channels. Ongoing work is done to reduce the effect of this selection bias utilizing several statistical analysis tools such as Multilevel Regression and Poststratification models ( 12 ) . Of note, even if selection bias exists, it will most likely be present throughout the entire study period, and is therefore less likely to lead to the relative changes that are seen in the symptoms prevalence during the study period.",
