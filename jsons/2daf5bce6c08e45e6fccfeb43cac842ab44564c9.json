However, the methods to quantify viral RNA and to link those quantities to the level of infection within the community vary. In this study, we sought to identify and optimize scalable methods for recovery of viral nucleic acids from wastewater and attempted to use a constitutive member of the gut virome, human-specific crAssphage, to help account for unknown levels of SARS-CoV-2 decay and dilution in the wastewater infrastructure. Results suggest that ultracentrifugation of a small volume of wastewater through a 50% sucrose cushion followed by total nucleic acid extraction yielded quantifiable virus in an area with a modest number of COVID-19 cases.",

Medema and colleagues used moderate speed centrifugation methods with centrifuge filters (Centricon\u00ae Filters) to successfully concentrate and purify viral particles/genomes 4 . This method was somewhat successfully replicated by another group that also had some success by filtration through electronegative membranes 7 . However, the cost and availability of centrifuge filters can be limiting for some laboratories, especially considering to likelihood of supply chain disruptions during a pandemic. Perhaps the most scalable method that requires very little specialized equipment was proposed by Wu and colleagues where 0.2 micron filtrates were PEG-precipitated and then Trizol\u2122 extracted to obtain purified RNA 8 . Among the simplest procedures reported, assuming the equipment is available, is the ultracentrifugation of small volumes (11 ml) of wastewater for one hour followed by extracting nucleic acids from the pellet 5 . Aluminum-driven flocculation followed by nucleic acid extraction has also been used to successfully detect the virus in wastewater 9 . Tangential flow filtration followed by PEGprecipitation has also been used to concentrate and purify viruses from wastewater, but might pose problems in scaling-up due to the length of time needed to filter a single sample 10 . In the anticipation that wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens will become widespread, methods that are sensitive, scalable, and cost-effective will be needed by regional and local laboratories.",

An attractive prospect is to use viral concentrations in wastewater to estimate the number of infected individuals \"upstream\" in the represented catchment area. Pairing results from wastewater with shedding rates to arrive at the estimated number of infected individuals in the represented area provided a higher than expected number of cases in the Boston area 8 and highly uncertain estimates in Southeast Queensland 7 . Factors that remain problematic to this approach and others are the low concentrations of virus obtained, which thereby increases the uncertainty in the quantification process, as well as issues regarding viral fate and transport throughout the wastewater infrastructure.",

Since we also sought an inexpensive, effective method that could be brought to scale, ultracentrifugation seemed attractive because few supplies were needed, which allowed us to bypass some supply chain issues, and many research institutions in the region have the required equipment on site. Our results indicate that ultracentrifugation incorporating a 50% sucrose cushion was successful at concentrating viral nucleic acids while removing impurities. As a result, we were able to detect, and in most cases, quantify SARS-CoV-2 in small volumes (20 ml) of wastewater collected from an area with a moderate number of COVID-19 cases. We also show that the ratio of SARS-CoV-2:crAssphage visually correlates with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19.",

Samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C following collection and transported on ice to Upstate Medical University (Syracuse, NY) for processing the next morning. Upon receipt, samples were mixed to resuspend particulates and 20 ml was aliquoted to a 38.5 ml ultracentrifuge tube (ThermoFisher, #750000471). A 12 ml sucrose cushion (50% sucrose in TNE buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA]) was carefully added underneath the wastewater with a 10 ml disposable serological pipette so that two distinct layers were formed ( Figure 1A ). Fifty percent sucrose yielded higher crAssphage DNA concentrations than 20% or 70% (Table  S1 ). In batches of six, samples were then purified by centrifugation at 150,000 x g at 4\u00b0C for either 90 minutes (May 6) or 45 minutes (May 13) on a Sorvall WX Ultra series with a Sorvall Surespin\u2122 630 rotor (ThermoFisher). Centrifugation times of 45 and 90 minutes provided roughly the same recovery of viral nucleic acids (Table S2) . Supernatant was then decanted, and pellets ( Figure 1B ) were resuspended in 200 \u00b5L 1X PBS. Pellets were stored at -20\u00b0C for <12 hours prior to nucleic acid extraction.

However, many recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater are limited by the low levels of viral RNA recovered which can limit quantitative interpretation 4, 7 . Here, we report the optimization of a simple sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation method for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater that provided quantitative results from a relatively small sample size (20 ml) in about 8 hours depending on the number of samples processed at one time. We understand that the requirement of an ultracentrifuge is unrealistic for many and that other approaches will be required in the absence of this equipment. Nonetheless, using a single centrifuge, we estimate a modest throughput of about 60 samples in 24 hours with these methods.",

Many of the same attributes that make crAssphage an attractive indicator organism, such as its prevalence and abundance in the human population as well as its scarcity in other hosts 11, 16 , are also helpful in gauging the degree of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the community. In addition to using crAssphage as an abundant surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 during method development and optimization, crAssphage can be used to ensure sufficient viral recovery, which may become an important quality assurance measure when comparing wastewater surveillance data within and between labs. Furthermore, like SARS-CoV-2, crAssphage is subject to decay and dilution within the wastewater infrastructure and while concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 alone are difficult to interpret, the ratio of SARS-CoV-2:crAssphage is likely more robust to processes that contribute to the loss of viral nucleic acids during transport. It is conceivable that these ratios could then be used to rank catchment areas by their relative degree of transmission independent of mass-balance calculations.",

Furthermore, DNA released from lysed viral particles is thought to be more resilient to degradation than RNA. The hypothesized rapid decay of SARS-CoV-2 compared to crAssphage would likely result in the underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the community when using this approach. Decay rates of the two viruses and their genetic material within water infrastructure are needed to further refine predictions of transmission within the population using this approach. Decay may also play a larger role in larger service areas with longer average wastewater transit times and may explain why only low levels of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in some areas with known cases.",

Six 20 ml aliquots were then distributed to 38.5 ml ultracentrifuge tubes.
