These organisms or superbugs are returning in new forms resistant to almost all clinically important antimicrobials. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical pipeline merely does not have enough new medicines to maintain pace with drug-resistant bacterial infections [1]. Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of such clinically significant organisms that have acquired much public health concern. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant Enterobacteriaceae considered as one of the opportunistic pathogens causing broad spectra of diseases and showing increasingly frequent acquisition of resistance to antibiotics.",

[2], this organism accounts for about one-third of all Gram-negative infections such as urinary tract infections, cystitis, pneumonia, surgical wound infections, endocarditis and septicemia. It also causes necrotizing pneumonia, pyogenic liver abscesses and endogenous endophthalmitis [3]. High mortality rates, extended hospitalization, coupled with high cost are often associated with infections caused by this organism [4]. The drastic rise in the incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae group is a major economic problem as these pathogens are prevalent natural residents of human and animal microbiome. Despites its numerous clinical importance, there is still paucity of information on K. pneumoniae.",

The antimicrobial resistance profiles and the virulence profiles of these strains vary with the former tagged as notorious [3, 5]. Notwithstanding, several clones of these ncKp have also been implicated in causing severe and difficult to threat infections due to their continuous mutation and the acquisition of plasmids and transposons which carries resistant and virulent genes. This has led to the emergences of strains such as hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) or hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (HMKP). This strain was first identified in Eastern part of Asia and has since spread worldwide [6]. This subtype is non-resistant to most of the commonly used antimicrobials such as colistin and carbapenems. But the recent reports of carbapenem-resistant hvKp strains which belong to the sequence types 11 (ST11) [7], ST25 and ST65 [8] poses a major clinical concern.",

This hvKp is known to habour (i) sidephore; predominant of which is aerobactin which is concomitant with hypermucoviscosity, (ii) virulent factors such as; K1, K2, K20 capsular types, rmpA and rmpA2 mucoid-regulator genes [10]. The horizontal transfer of these plasmids and transposons has led to the multidrug resistance (MDR) and the extremely drug resistance (XDR) nature of most of these subtypes. The high prevalence rate of MDR and XDR K. pneumoniae subtypes reflects a multifactorial dissemination processes that include but not limited to: the spread of high risk global multi-resistant genetic lineage [11]; acquisition of successful multi-resistant plasmids; and acquisition of resistant genes located on successful transposons. Klebsiella is a major source of carbapenem resistance worldwide by the dissemination of its plasmids which is facilitated by high genetic transfer (HGT) to other species. Spread of these extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) and Carbapenemase-encoding plasmids poses a major threat, as acquisition of these plasmids turn bacteria into MDR and XDR. In China, the most dominant MDR KPC-producing clone is the ST11. Once the blaKPC-2 gene is introduces into a certain location, especially in a hospital setup, under antibiotic selection pressure, further dissemination of this gene may occur which may lead to MDR and XDR strains. Hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae (HMKP) strain types which are sporadically distributed in Asia and the Middle East are the NDM-producing isolates [12, 13]. Liu et al. [14], had reported the first outbreak of CR-HMKP strains which harbored blaNDM-1 gene, shared the same pulsotypes (PT) and belong to the same Sequence types (ST).",

Carrier levels in hospitalized patients are significantly higher, with reported rates of 77% in the stool, 19% in the pharynx, and 42% on the hands [3]. The higher rates of colonization are primarily related to the increasing use of antibiotics [3, 17, 18]. The increase in colonization rate of K. pneumoniae as observed in these clinical samples is of epidemiological important because, Klebsiella nosocomial infection was four times higher in stool carriers compared with non-carriers [19]. In a study in Taiwan, antibiotic use (e.g. ampicillin or amoxicillin) within the last 30 days was associated with an increased risk of liver abscess [20], suggesting that an increasing exposure to antimicrobials and the last period of antimicrobial administration is a major risk factor for K. pneumoniae colonization and infection.",

Although low resistance rate to colistin and imipenem were recorded in this review, more cautious efforts should be made to develop new line of antimicrobials as resistance to these drugs are surging. It is very important for public healthcare departments to monitor and report the changes in antimicrobial-resistant isolates. This will guide doctors in prescribing the proper antimicrobials in case of resistance gene evolution. It is essential to design a preparedness plan in order to tackle this public health danger. On the other side, control measures must include a multi-faceted strategy coordinated by the domestic health officials in fields.",
