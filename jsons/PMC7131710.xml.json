Over the past decade, the number of HSCT procedures performed in the United States has steadily increased, with more than 8000 allogeneic procedures and almost 14,000 autologous procedures reported in 2015.1 In the past, conditioning regimen\u2013related toxicity greatly limited the applicability of allogeneic transplantation to only younger patients without major comorbidities. However, the development of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative regimens that rely primarily on immunologic mechanisms (graft vs leukemia) rather than myeloablation to eradicate malignancy has greatly reduced early toxicity and allowed transplantation of older and sicker patients.1, 2, 3, 4\n",

Large volumes of fluid are frequently administered concurrently with conditioning regimen chemotherapy to reduce toxicity. Transfusion of blood products, infusion of intravenous medications, and parenteral nutrition are other common reasons for volume administration in the early posttransplant period. Hypoalbuminemia and subsequent development of chemotherapy-induced cardiac dysfunction and/or renal failure further increases the propensity for developing hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Rapid infusion of multiple units of blood products increases the risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, especially in older patients with cardiac and/or renal dysfunction.12 Lung injury from chemotherapy and radiation, blood transfusions, and sepsis may increase capillary permeability and also contribute to pulmonary edema risk. Important clinical findings include weight gain, rapid onset of dyspnea, bibasilar rales on auscultation, hypoxemia, and radiographic findings consistent with pulmonary edema.13 On high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) chest scan, characteristic findings include interlobular septal thickening and bilateral ground glass opacities; pleural effusions also may be seen.14 Close attention to volume status and judicious use of diuretics may reduce the risk of pulmonary edema development.15\n",

Plasma-rich products such as platelets, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma confer the greatest risk. Notably, there have been 2 case reports of TRALI developing immediately after infusion of the bone marrow graft.18, 19 Patients develop acute onset of dyspnea and often have fever and hypotension. Acute leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may be seen, but this is not a distinguishing feature in patients in the preengraftment phase. Chest radiograph (CXR) findings are similar to patients with other types of pulmonary edema. Cardiac imaging typically shows normal left ventricular function. Mechanism of injury has not been fully elucidated, but involves a 2-step process initiated by trafficking of primed neutrophils to damaged lung microvasculature and subsequent neutrophil activation by antibodies in transfused blood products directed against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and human neutrophil antigens. Neutrophils also may be activated by other substances in transfused blood, such as bioactive lipids and soluble CD40 ligand.20 The activated neutrophils release proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and proteases that damage the lung. Reports of TRALI in neutropenic patients support the hypothesis that passively transfused HLA antibodies also may directly target antigens on pulmonary vascular endothelium.20, 21, 22 The HSCT recipient may be at especially high risk for TRALI, as transfusions are frequently required and many of these patients have underlying systemic inflammation triggered by condition regimen toxicity, sepsis, and graft versus host disease (GVHD).17\n",

            "text": "Although the pathophysiology of IPS remains incompletely understood, preclinical and translational studies have greatly informed our knowledge of mechanisms of lung injury and have served as the foundation for clinical trials investigating therapeutic approaches. These studies were reviewed in a recent official ATS Research Statement on IPS.35 Murine models of allogeneic HSCT demonstrate extensive inflammation/injury in alveolar, interstitial, bronchial, and vascular tissues. In particular, animal data suggest that pulmonary endothelial cell damage caused directly by conditioning regimen toxicity and indirectly through activation of a robust inflammatory response are the principal events in the development of IPS.41 The cytokine tumor necrosis factor\u2013alpha (TNF-\u03b1) appears to be a key mediator of this inflammatory response. Murine studies have shown that increasing levels of donor-derived TNF-\u03b1 in BAL fluid and lung tissue are associated with IPS severity and that transplantation of stem cells from TNF-\u03b1 knockout mice or administration of a neutralizing TNF-binding antibody greatly reduced lung injury.42, 43 In addition to TNF-\u03b1, high levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin also have been observed in the BAL fluid of mice. LPS is a component of the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria and is capable of directly activating the innate immune system. Macrophages and other immune cells produce TNF-\u03b1 in response to LPS stimulation. In murine models of IPS, LPS injection has been shown to markedly increase lung injury.43 It has been hypothesized that conditioning regimen\u2013related injury or acute GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract facilitates bacterial translocation and subsequent release of LPS into the systemic and ultimately pulmonary circulation, resulting in production of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1.35 Animal models indicate that blocking the effects of TNF-\u03b1 does not completely prevent IPS and numerous other mechanisms of lung injury are thought to play an important role.35 Nevertheless, the preclinical data provided a compelling rationale to investigate blockade of the TNF-\u03b1 pathway in human clinical trials of IPS.",

A sample size of 120 patients was targeted. Unfortunately, patient accrual was slow and the study was halted after enrollment of only 34 patients. Although the study was underpowered and definitive conclusions could not be made, no difference in clinical response was seen. Ten (63%) of 18 patients in the etanercept arm achieved clinical response, whereas 12 (67%) of 18 in the placebo arm met criteria for response. There was also no difference in outcome at day 56. Overall survival at 1 year remained similarly poor in both groups, with 77% mortality in the treatment arm and 83% in the placebo group. This study proved to be very challenging to conduct. Almost 40% of patients in the etanercept arm received only 2 or fewer doses. As an explanation for early discontinuation of study drug, investigators reported hesitance to continue \u201cblinded\u201d treatment, especially if the patient did not demonstrate early clinical improvement.30 The investigators also commented on improved short-term outcomes in both study groups compared with prior and speculated whether the clinical characteristics of IPS had changed over the past decade. In fact, in this study, more than 40% of patients had received RIC; it is possible that less toxicity from chemoradiation resulted in lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 and diminished likelihood of response to etanercept treatment. In support of this hypothesis is the result of a recent multicenter, albeit, nonrandomized phase II study of etanercept treatment in pediatric patients with IPS demonstrating significant short-term and long-term benefit with 28-day and 1-year survival rates of 89% and 63%, respectively.45 In contrast to the adult study, in this pediatric trial, only 4% of the patients received RIC regimens. In the future, a more tailored (eg, patients with high levels of TNF-\u03b1 or HSCT recipients who receive conventional conditioning regimens) approach to treating patients with IPS could be considered, but this strategy would need to be evaluated in clinical trials.30 Despite the results of this one randomized study in adults, in the absence of other treatment options, etanercept remains a therapeutic option for patients with severe IPS.",

For this reason, immunosuppressed, thrombocytopenic HSCT recipients are generally not considered candidates for this type of support. Advances in ECLS technology, however, have reduced complications and permitted use of lower levels, or even withholding, of systemic anticoagulation.47 With these advances, there have been case reports of patients with IPS who were successfully bridged to recovery with ECLS even while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and etanercept.48, 49 Nevertheless, as outcomes of patients with IPS remain generally poor for adult patients, the risk of a \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d scenario is not insignificant and can result in extremely difficult situations in which a potentially alert but critically ill patient remains dependent on ECLS.50 Thus, it is essential that before ECLS technologies are used that clear expectations are established with the patient and family regarding the high likelihood of treatment failure, anticipated complications, duration and limits of extracorporeal support, and the factors the medical team will use to recommend withdrawal of ECLS. Early consultation with a palliative care team, if available, may be helpful.50\n",

In a study of 223 consecutive HSCT recipients who underwent bronchoscopy between January 2002 and December 2004 at the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 53 patients were identified to have noninfectious DAH. One-month survival was 59% and 6-month survival was 46%, better than what had been reported in many previous studies.52 Type of transplant and timing also may impact outcomes. In a large retrospective series from the Mayo Clinic of 1215 patients who underwent HSCT from October 1994 through June 2002, 48 patients (3.9%) were diagnosed with DAH. The development of DAH after autologous transplantation and early onset (within 30 days of transplant) had a significantly better outcome (approximately 70% survival) than DAH after allogeneic transplantation and onset beyond 30 days (approximately 30% survival).60\n",

Notably, patients who initially received lower doses of corticosteroids (<250 mg/d methylprednisolone) had reduced intensive care unit and hospital mortality compared with patients who had received higher doses. However, as this was not a randomized study, significant bias in treatment decisions related to underlying severity of illness cannot be excluded; thus the validity of this finding is uncertain. Adjunctive treatment with the antifibrinolytic drug aminocaproic acid in a subset of these patients did not seem to impact outcome.57 Unfortunately, there are no randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids at varying doses for the treatment of post-HSCT DAH. Conduct of this type of trial would require clinical equipoise that likely does not exist in practice. Nevertheless, results of recent retrospective studies should caution providers against using high doses of corticosteroids.",

            "text": "HSCT recipients are exposed to numerous chemotherapeutic agents that have been associated with lung injury. These drugs have been implicated as important risk factors for many of the acute lung injury syndromes discussed earlier in this section. However, isolated drug-specific effects should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of early lung injury. For example, in the 1990s, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome (DPTS) described a corticosteroid-responsive pulmonary complication seen exclusively after high-dose chemotherapy (bischloroethylnitrosurea, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide) followed by rescue autologous HSCT for treatment of breast cancer.5 In support of drug toxicity as the primary risk factor was the observation that patients who received conventional doses rather than high doses of this chemotherapy regimen had significantly lower rates of DPTS (8% vs 72%).85 Symptoms of DPTS were nonspecific and included cough, dyspnea on exertion, and fever that developed in most cases within the first 100 days after transplantation.86 Chest CT scan typically showed ground glass opacities. In cases when surgical lung biopsy was performed, pathologic findings of alveolar septal thickening with interstitial fibrosis, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and endothelial cell injury were seen. These findings were consistent, although not specific for drug-induced lung injury.87 Notably, over the past decade, this treatment approach has fallen out of favor, as several studies failed to demonstrate survival benefit of this high-dose chemotherapy regimen.88 Over this time period, there have been no additional published reports of DPTS. Although this one specific type of lung injury syndrome is no longer reported, the clinician must be aware of the potential for pulmonary toxicity related to other drugs. Examples of some of the medications that HSCT recipients may receive before or after transplantation with potential to cause pulmonary toxicity include bleomycin, busulfan, methotrexate, sirolimus, amiodarone, cytarabine, chlorambucil, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, rituximab, bortezomib, and thalidomide.89 Novel immunologic approaches to treating relapsed disease with checkpoint inhibitors (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway or infusion of chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells are also associated with systemic inflammation and acute lung injury.90, 91\n",

            "text": "Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is a noninfectious form of lung injury that mimics pneumonia and may occur in the early period after HSCT but is more commonly seen at later time points, with reported median time of presentation at approximately day 100.92 Clinical symptoms on presentation are nonspecific and include nonproductive cough, fever, and progressive dyspnea. On radiographic imaging, migratory alveolar infiltrates with bronchovascular and/or subpleural distribution, focal or multifocal ground glass opacities, and linear bands have been reported.93 Bronchoscopy is helpful to rule out an infectious etiology. If surgical lung biopsy is performed, pathologic findings of plugs of granulation tissues in the alveolar ducts and sacs with associated chronic interstitial inflammation and proximal extension into distal airway lumens is diagnostic.94 Although COP has been reported after both autologous and allogeneic HSCT, most cases occur after allogeneic HSCT. In a report from the Mayo Clinic of 5340 allogeneic transplantations between 1976 and 1998, 49 cases of COP were identified by surgical lung biopsy. In contrast, only 2 cases were seen in the 1183 patients who underwent autologous transplantation.94 In a more contemporary review from the Japanese transplant registry of 9550 allogeneic HSCT recipients from 2005 to 2009, 193 cases (2%) were identified.92 In both studies, grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD was identified as an important risk factor for COP, with the Japanese registry study also reporting increasing HLA disparity, female-to-male transplants, and peripheral blood stem cell source as risk factors. RIC with a fludarabine-based regimen and myeloablative conditioning with busulfan rather than TBI appeared to reduce COP risk.92, 94 COP is generally a steroid-responsive condition. Treatment recommendations for COP are similar to what has been recommended in the nontransplant setting, and involves administration of corticosteroids (eg, 0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg prednisolone) with slow tapering over months. Patients, however, are at significant risk for disease recurrence or flaring with dose reduction and, overall, patients who develop COP after transplantation have inferior outcomes compared with nontransplant recipients.92\n",

Pretransplant PFT measurements were evaluated and found to correlate significantly with risk of respiratory failure and death. The investigators found that the combination of 2 PFT variables (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) had superior discriminating ability for predicting respiratory failure and death compared with any single measurement. The FEV1 and DLCO were used to establish a patient\u2019s lung function score, and those with higher scores had the greatest risk. In fact, patients in category IV (FEV1 <60%, DLCO <60%) had an estimated survival of less than 25%.37 Outcomes were especially poor for patients in categories II to IV if they had received TBI as part of the conditioning regimen.",

Initial enthusiasm for treating these conditions with high doses of immunomodulatory agents, such as corticosteroids and etanercept, has been dampened by the results of more recent studies, although certain distinct conditions, such as PERDS, may be more responsive to treatment. Pretransplant PFT results can help to risk stratify patients and inform treatment approaches.
