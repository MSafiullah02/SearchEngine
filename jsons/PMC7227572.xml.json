Non-COVID-19 out-patients with chronic and acute diseases have their regular needs provided by healthcare systems that might no longer be able to meet these in the same way as previously. Newly diagnosed patients with disease related malnutrition, or other forms of nutritional imbalances, should be prescribed timely and appropriate nutritional support by their family physicians. Also, chronic patients with previously prescribed nutritional support should be re-screened, monitored and their nutritional therapy should continue to be prescribed where indicated. Many consulting services can be done remotely by ensuring good digital communication channels between patients, family physicians and hospital physicians or specialists. National health services and health insurance funds should enable the use and reimbursement of referrals for a specialist's services that do not require the patient to physically attend the hospital. Such model is present in Croatia since the year 2015. The Spanish NHS has gradually included modality of e-consultation in different Spanish regions in primary care and hospital specialists during the last decade, and it has been recently included by the insurance companies during COVID - 19 pandemics. In Germany, remote monitoring of cardiology patients is well established since several years; a wider application of e-consultation has been facilitated only recently for family physicians and specialists with reimbursement by the NHS.",

So, it is essential that family physicians receive correct information by patients or caregivers, as guaranteed by the use of validated screening tools.",

During this time patients are confined to their homes or other closed facilities, most of them minimally mobile or bedridden. The consequence of inactivity is rapid muscle atrophy and loss of strength and function [17,18]. It has been shown that even 10-days of bed rest in older healthy individuals leads to a significant decrease in total lean body mass, even without a significant change in total body weight [19,20], and that the sarcopenic phenomenon is greater than observed in young adults after 14 or 28 days of bed rest [18].",

The acronym for the tool is R-MAPP, as for Remote \u2013 Malnutrition APP, while the tool is being developed as an app. Since the tool is designed for the family physicians in the conditions of remote patient care, it can also stand for Remote \u2013 MAlnutrition in the Primary Practice. Three criteria are used in \u2018MUST\u2019 to assess the risk of malnutrition: body mass index (BMI), unintentional weight loss, and acute disease effect [26]. In order to assess loss of muscle mass and function without any diagnostic tools and procedures the SARC-F questionnaire ca be used as a rapid diagnostic test for sarcopenia based only on muscle contractile performance items: strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs and falls [27].",

For obese patients or those with sarcopenic obesity, ideal body weight should be used to calculate requirements. In terms of protein, caution is needed in patients with severe kidney disease (e. GFR\u226430 mL/min/1.73 m2), and it should not be higher than 0.6 g/kg BW/d unless on dialysis which leads to higher requirements.",

Sarcopenia may be severe in post-ICU COVID-19 patients that present with ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) [31]. While there is no reliable pharmacologic intervention for sarcopenia, conservative measures are the mainstay of the treatment. These measures include physical therapy and/or resistance training together with nutrition support: supplementation with protein (1\u20131.5 g/kg/d), specific anabolic amino acids or their metabolites (\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate, leucine), and vitamin D (800\u20131000 IU/d). In sarcopenic obesity, we recommend an energy restricted diet, accompanied by supplementation with protein and the other key (pharmaco)nutrients, an approach that is even more challenging than the in case of malnutrition related sarcopenia [40,41]. Supplementation with protein and key nutrients can be performed by use of oral nutritional supplements (medical nutrition) and/or food supplements.

In COVID-19 patients, post-extubation dysphagia can be observed, and could be extended for to up to 21 days after prolonged intubation particularly in older persons [31]. Clinical nutrition, which entails different modalities of feeding, from oral diet therapy to specialized artificial nutritional support (enteral or parenteral), is essential for the management of dysphagia. Changes in the consistency (modified texture) of foods and liquids and use of oral enteral formulas with adjusted texture may ease the ingestion process and help reduce the risk of aspiration [40], while enteral tube feeding should be considered for individuals with an unsafe swallow.",
