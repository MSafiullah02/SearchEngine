As it is virtually the only antigen present at the virus surface, S is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection and a focus of vaccine design. 2 The coronavirus S is a class I viral fusion protein synthetized as a single chain precursor of 1300 amino acids which trimerizes upon folding. It comprises an N-terminal S 1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain and a C-terminal S 2 subunit which is the membraneanchored stalk carrying out membrane fusion. Cleavage by furin-like host proteases at the junction between S 1 and S 2 (S 2 cleavage site) occurs during biogenesis for some coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV, the prototypical and best studied coronavirus). [3] [4] [5] Coronavirus spike proteins have proven difficult targets for structural characterization and all reported studies have provided atomic resolution data for only a few isolated domains. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The SARS-CoV S has also been studied in its native environment by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) of intact virions, providing insights at low resolution into its overall shape. 14, 15 However, the lack of highresolution data for any coronavirus spike trimer until earlier this year had prevented a detailed analysis of the mechanisms associated with infection.",

[23] [24] [25] Construct Design Viral fusion proteins adopt a metastable pre-fusion conformation at the virus surface until triggered to rearrange into a more stable post fusion conformation which promotes merger of viral and host membranes. 26 The significant magnitude of the conformational changes taking place during the fusion reaction could result in masking of epitopes initially accessible in the prefusion state and exposure of new epitopes specific to the post-fusion state. As a result, vaccine design initiatives aim at targeting the pre-fusion state of viral fusion proteins, which correspond to the conformation that could be detected by the immune system before infection. The intrinsic metastability of viral fusion proteins is usually associated with challenges to preserve the pre-fusion state during purification. This is illustrated by the case of the respiratory syncytial virus (paramyxovirus) F protein which required coexpression of the ectodomain (fused to a T4 foldon motif) with a pre-fusion specific Fab to enable isolation of this conformation. [27] [28] [29] During biogenesis, the MHV S protein is often naturally cleaved at the S 1 -S 2 junction (S 2 cleavage site) by Golgi-resident furin(-like) proteases 3,30 [ Fig.  2(A) ] resulting in an increase in its fusogenic propensity. After cleavage, the S 1 and S 2 subunits remain non-covalently associated in the metastable prefusion S trimer. In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, S 2 processing has also been suggested to promote subsequent cleavage at a second site located just upstream of the fusion peptide (S 2 ' cleavage site) to allow the fusion reaction to proceed upon virion uptake by a target cell. 4, 5 We engineered a construct featuring a single amino acid substitution in the S 2 cleavage site to prevent furin processing and enhance the stability of the MHV S ectodomain pre-fusion structure. Substitution of an arginine residue present at position 717 by a serine residue at the site of cleavage (from RAHR# to RAHS) resulted in the purification of a homogeneous uncleaved protein product as confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis [ Fig. 2(B) ].",

Proper folding of the purified MHV S ectodomain was confirmed by analyzing its binding affinity to the CEACAM1a ectodomain (the viral receptor) using microscale thermophoresis [ Fig.  2(D) ]. We determined a dissociation equilibrium constant of 48.5 6 3.8 nM which is in good agreement with the value of 21.4 6 4.2 nM reported by Peng et al. 12 for the isolated receptor-binding domain.

We interpret this observation as resulting from the surface tension exerted on the S trimers in thin vitreous ice. Hence, we targeted holes with slightly thicker ice than desired in which we could observe compact well-folded MHV S trimers, similar to what was observed using negative staining EM [ Fig. 3(B) ]. We collected a large dataset (1,600 micrographs) at high defocus (2.0-5.0 mm) to maximize the low-resolution contrast and our ability to align the particle images during subsequent processing. This example illustrates that although it is not always possible to acquire data in the thinnest possible areas of ice (especially for fragile protein complexes), near-atomic resolution reconstructions can still be obtained by tailoring the imaging conditions appropriately.",

These differences can result from different conformations of the same protein, different chemical compositions due to loss of one or several subunits of a protein complex, or (partial) denaturation of a fraction of the particles during purification or vitrification. If left untreated, this heterogeneity can limit the resolution and compromise the quality of the final map. 3D classification has emerged as an extraordinarily powerful tool to deal with structural heterogeneity in allowing to computationally isolate homogeneous subsets of the data. [36] [37] [38] We relied on extensive 2D and 3D classification using the Relion software 39, 40 to deal with the marked structural heterogeneity of the MHV S ectodomain trimer dataset. We ran a first round of 3D classification without imposing symmetry to improve separation of \"good\" and \"compromised\" particle images. Figure 4 shows isosurface representation [ Fig. 4(A) ] and slices [ Fig. 4(B) ] going through the center of each of the four reconstructions corresponding to the four classes requested during unsupervised 3D classification. Although looking at the classified maps did reveal differences between the different classes, looking at the aforementioned slices further confirmed the structural heterogeneity present in this dataset at a glance, as previously suggested by Scheres et al. 19 At the resolution of our analysis, we could not identify distinct conformations of the MHV S trimer and postulated that the particles contributing to less-well resolved classes could be partially denatured.",

Roset-taCM was then used to rebuild the core b-sheet of domain B and to derive a putative model (using density-guided homology modeling) for the disordered extension corresponding to the receptorbinding motifs in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The quality of the map corresponding to domains C and D hampered manual sequence assignment for this region of the protein. Rosetta de novo 25 successfully identified a 30 residue-long fragment allowing to anchor the sequence register for domains C and D. The placement of several bulky side chains accounted for by the density and the identification of putative N-linked glycans suggested correct assignment, and allowed completion of the model [ Fig.  6(C,D) ].

The construct also harbors a GCN4 trimerization motif fused in register with the HR2 helix at the C-terminal end of the MHV S encoding sequence. UH: upstream helix, FP: fusion peptide. (B) SDS-PAGE analysis of the secreted MHV S ectodomain confirms the lack of proteolytic processing during biogenesis. (C) Size exclusion chromatography coupled on line with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) showed the expressed protein forms a homotrimer. The deviation of the estimated molecular weight (463.2 6 0.3 kDa) from the theoretical one (418.9 kDa) likely corresponds to N-linked glycans. The red line represents the molecular mass (left axis, Da) while the blue line represents the normalized refractive index (right axis, arbitrary units). (D) The MHV S ectodomain binds with high affinity to soluble CEACAM1a (the host receptor).
