ADEM forms one of several categories of primary inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the CNS. Others include multiple sclerosis (MS), optic neuropathy, acute transverse myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica (Devic\u2019s disease).1\n",

Optic neuropathy and ADEM are rare complications associated with vaccinations.[1], [3], [4], [5] Most case reports describe patients experiencing a unilateral or bilateral optic neuropathy or ADEM, rather than simultaneous onset of both conditions. Optic neuropathy has also recurred in one patient after repeat administration of the influenza vaccination.4 The presumptive mechanism is immune-mediated demyelination although immune-complex mediated vasculopathy has also been postulated.5 Spontaneous recovery or improvement after corticosteroids has been reported for post-vaccination optic neuropathy and ADEM3 although permanent visual loss has also been described.5\n",

Nakayama and Onoda found 3 cases of ADEM and nine of Guillain-Barre among 38.02 million doses of influenza vaccine administered between 1994 and 2004 by the Kitasato Institute, Japan.19 Giant cell arteritis has also been associated recently with the influenza vaccination.15 All the influenza vaccines available in Australia are either split virion or subunit vaccines prepared from purified inactivated influenza virus cultivated in embryonated hens\u2019 eggs. The safety and efficacy of split virion and subunit vaccines are generally considered to be equivalent.20\n",

In EAE, a disease that clinically and pathologically resembles ADEM, inflammation is produced when an experimental animal is inoculated with myelin or myelin antigens.1 High-affinity antibodies directed against myelin-basic protein (MBP) have been identified in ADEM patients vaccinated with Semple strain rabies, but not MS patients.2 However, this does not explain the origin and cause of post-vaccination ADEM due to smallpox and several other vaccines that are prepared without the involvement of neural tissues.1\n",

Newer studies, however, shown that lesions in ADEM may evolve over several weeks and consequently only some lesions may be enhanced, or there may also be no enhancement.29 Follow-up MRI scans after a minimum interval of 6 months is recommended to establish or confirm the diagnosis of ADEM at which time there should be a resolution, partial or complete, of old lesions and no new lesions.[1], [2] The appearance of new lesions is strongly suggestive of MS.",

The same study also demonstrated that lower mean CSF albumin and IgG concentrations of 68.3 mg/dL and 8.1 mg/dL, respectively, were associated with a favourable prognosis whereas mean concentrations of 106.5 mg/dL and 19.1 mg/dL, respectively, were associated with a poor outcome. In a population of 40 adult ADEM patients studied by Schwarz et al., 35% developed clinically definite MS over a mean observational period of 38 months.29 However, preceding infection or vaccination was not a prerequisite in their initial diagnoses of ADEM.",
