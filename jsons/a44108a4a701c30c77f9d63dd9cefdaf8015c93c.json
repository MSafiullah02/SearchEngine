The global health care worker (HCW) can be exposed to a wide range of infectious diseases during their global experiences. A pre-travel risk assessment visit and all appropriate vaccinations and education are performed. Universal practices of water safety, food safety, and insect avoidance will prevent a majority of travel related infections and complications. Region specific vaccinations will further reduce illness risk.. An understanding of common travel related illness signs and symptoms is helpful. Lastly, emerging pathogens that can cause a pandemic, such as SARS-CoV-2, should be understood to avoid healthcare worker infection and spread in the workplace and when returning home.",

This travel requires preparation to prevent infectious diseases at the location of travel as well as disease that can occur upon return [1, 2] . Only a minority of illness will occur during travel, requiring a premature return to the home country [2, 3] . Most of the illnesses will be minor and can be cared for locally. A recent study of 100,000 travelers (of all types) to the developing world, roughly 300 will undergo hospitalization, 50 will be air evacuated and 1 will die [4, 5] . Surprisingly, a majority of mortality and morbidity associated with travel remain cardiovascular disease and trauma sustained from motor vehicle accidents, not infectious diseases [4, 5] Recent literature suggest that infectious diseases account for less than 5% of travel associated mortality among travelers and healthcare workers [2, 6] . Mostly importantly, these infectious diseases are largely preventable and a well prepared HCW will largely have uneventful travel allowing them to provide the maximal care to their patients. This chapter will focus on the basic generic preparation, prevention, and treatment of infectious diseases for the global healthcare worker.",

These infections can come from the environment, community members, or most importantly, the local healthcare system. As such, the list of potential etiologic agents is very broad and hard to differentiate and most importantly, varies widely from location to location [1, 2] . In general, travel-associated infections are acquired via enteral, respiratory, vector-borne, and/or sexual exposures. The most common travel related infections fall into gastrointestinal, febrile, and dermatologic illnesses [3] .. Thus, preparing for all diseases globally is an impossible task. Preparation must include reviewing the local epidemiology of the country visited. Even in these circumstances, local epidemiology can vary greatly given population migration, weather, vector growth, healthcare and public health infrastructure, and emerging pathogen presence. Thus, travel medicine must be tailored to the location. A few generic preparation actions can apply globally and in many cases, a few diseases (e.g. Malaria, tuberculosis) can appear frequently across locations. In these cases, a broad preparation plan of education, vaccination, and basic disease preparation will provide care in most cases, with a few adjustments to complement the local epidemiology.",

The most common presentation is fever, headache, malaise, chest and joint pain, and weight loss. More severe cases progress with abdominal pain, jaundice, splenomegaly, and progress to the severe symptoms of altered consciousness with or without seizures, respiratory distress or ARDS, hypotension and heart failure, metabolic acidosis, renal failure with hemoglobinuria (\"blackwater fever\"), hepatic failure, coagulopathy, severe anemia, and hypoglycemia [27] [28] [29] Cerebral malaria with encephalopathy and seizures carry the worst prognosis, which is not part of this patient's presentation [27] [28] [29] Artemisinin-based combination therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the P. falciparum parasite is the recommended mainstay [30, 31] . By combining 2 active ingredients with different mechanisms of action, combination therapy is the most effective antimalarial medicines available today. Artemisinin and its derivatives must not be used as oral monotherapy, as this promotes the development of artemisinin resistance. In low transmission areas, a single low dose of primaquine should be added to the antimalarial treatment in order to reduce transmission of the infection [30, 31] . P. vivax infections should be treated with an ACT or chloroquine in areas without chloroquine-resistant P. vivax. Parenteral therapy is preferred for rapid treatment [30, 31] There are two major classes of drugs available by IV administration: the cinchona alkaloids (quinine and quinidine) and the artemisinin derivatives (artesunate, artemether and artemotil) [30, 31] Based on clinical trials, artesunate is superior for treatment of severe falciparum malaria when compared to quinine [29] [30] [31] Additional support with blood transfusions can be considered in cases of altered consciousness, high output heart failure, respiratory distress, and/or high density parasitemia [29] [30] [31] . Exchange transfusion is additionally an option to reduce parasite load. Blood transfusion and exchange transfusion are largely supportive and have not been shown to reduce mortality [29] [30] [31] . Thus they should not delay the onset of therapy with artesunate or quinine. In rare cases, non-faciparum malaria can cause severe disease, and these cases, treatment is identical with artesunate or quinidine.",

For male partners with a pregnant partner, condoms must be used or abstain from sexual activity during pregnancy.

Chikungunya virus has spread from its origin in West Africa to Asia, Europe, islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and in the Americas. Infected travelers can import chikungunya virus into new areas, where local transmission can occur if competent mosquitoes are present. In Africa, chikungunya virus transmission occurs in cycles involving humans, Aedes and other mosquitoes, and animals (nonhuman primates and perhaps other animals) [36, [46] [47] [48] . Outside Africa, major outbreaks are sustained by mosquito transmission among susceptible humans. Transmission via maternal-fetal route and blood products have been described but unlike Zika and WNV, transmission through transplantation has not occurred. Incubation lasts from period of 3 to 7 days followed by an acute infection with fever and malaise [36, [46] [47] [48] . Polyarthralgia often begins 2-5 days after onset of fever and commonly involves multiple joints. The arthralgia is usually bilateral and symmetric, associated with morning stiffness, and involves the distal more than proximal joints. Skin manifestations include macular or maculopapular rash. For most individuals, the duration of acute illness is usually 7 to 10 days how ever the inflammatory arthritis can persist for weeks, months, or years [36, [46] [47] [48] . The chronic manifestations usually involve joints affected during the acute illness and can be relapsing or unremitting and incapacitating. Severe complications (including meningoencephalitis, cardiopulmonary decompensation, acute renal failure, and death) have been described with greater frequency among patients older than 65 years and those with underlying co-morbidities. The diagnosis of chikungunya is established by detection of chikungunya viral RNA by RT-PCR or serology [36, [46] [47] [48] . Testing for dengue, Zika and Ross River Valley virus infection should also be considered as they present similarly. There is no known treatment of chikungunya other than supportive care [36, [46] [47] [48] . Treatment of arthritis with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories is recommended.",

Disease onset is abrupt, and over the next few days, symptoms worsen to include prostration, stupor and hypotension. Shortly thereafter, impaired coagulation occurs with increased conjunctival and soft tissue bleeding. In some cases, more massive hemorrhage can occur in the gastrointestinal and urinary tract, and in rare instances, alveolar hemorrhage can occur [58] . The onset of maculopapular rash on the arms and trunk also appears classic and may be a very distinctive sign [55] . Along with the bleeding and hypotension, multi-organ failure occurs eventually leading to death. Reports of outbreaks and cases have largely occurred in developing countries where critical care resources are more limited [57] . .

However, coronaviruses are a major source of emerging pathogens given their RNA genome, ability to adapt to multiple hosts, and the frequent contact between wildlife, domesticated animals, humans. In 2003, a rapid progressive respiratory illness originating in China spread to multiple countries with over 8000 cases and a case fatality ratio of almost 10% [61] . . This disease was termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and a novel coronavirus was determined to be the etiologic (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1)) In September 2012, a case of novel coronavirus infection was reported involving a man in Saudi Arabia who was admitted to a hospital with pneumonia and acute kidney injury [62] . This case was followed by multiple clusters of infections in the Arabian peninsula and this outbreak was indeed related to a coronavirus (betacoronavirus) which is different but closely related to the other human betacoronaviruses (e.g. SARS). In fact, this virus's lineage was closely related to bat coronaviruses. Within 12 months, over 2400 confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had spread to over North Africa, Europe. Asia, and North America [61, 62] . . At the end of 2019, another acute respiratory syndrome was described in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China [63, 64] . . Likewise, this coronavirus is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus but different class as the SARS virus. Based on the viral taxonomy, this virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus spread rapidly throughout China and with increasing cases worldwide leading to an active pandemic. By May 2020, over 1 million cases have been identified on 6 continents with over 100,000 deaths [63, 64] . While cases of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have all but disappeared, SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent disease from this virus (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) are actively overwhelming hospitals and healthcare systems in North America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, thus altering the mobility and response of global healthcare workers.",

The infection also occurs through the touch of an infected surface with subsequent touch to the eyes, nose, or mouth (fomite spread) [65] . . SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood, and ocular secretions, but the role of these sites in transmission is unknown. Most importantly, spread through droplet mechanisms can be aerosolizied when undergoing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, manipulation of the sinus and airway with surgery, and invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation [60, 64, [66] [67] [68] .

While bacterial pathogens constitute most cases, the breadth of agents that can cause disease is enormous, with many having direct impacts on public health systems and the community [60] . . Many of these cases require further epidemiological and diagnostic testing which can take time and resources in order to determine the larger impact of one ill traveler [6] . Often these patients will not be isolated and tested for these pathogens upon admission, and they will additionally undergo higher risk aerosolizing procedures that will increase the likelihood for disease transmission [60, 69, 70] . . This puts both HCWs and other patients at risk for acquiring disease as experienced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the H1N1 pandemic, and other outbreaks of highly contagious disease [59, 60] . Therefore, a standardized approach, with early isolation and testing of these cases, can reduce the likelihood of disease transmission of an emerging pathogen within the ICU. Figure 1 outlines an approach to early isolation, testing, and involvement of institutional infection control and public health in cases of acute febrile illness in an returning healthcare worker. Upon admission, the patient should undergo initial diagnostic testing as discussed earlier.

Isolation should most likely be droplet, but based on specific epidemiological clues or high risk procedures, airborne isolation may be instituted [59, 67] . . Involvement of institutional infection control, microbiology, and public health should be started as early as possible [67, 69, 70] . . Usually this is performed after the common agents have been eliminated and a suspicious high risk pathogen is suspected [59] . Hospital based infection control will assist in isolation and HCW protection, and the hospital based microbiology laboratory should be notified of suspected pathogens, allowing for worker protection and targeted testing of samples [67, 69, 70] . . Finally, public health involvement will allow a broader viral testing, including additional agents, subtyping, and resistance testing as well as rapid laboratory testing, epidemiological investigation, case definition, and community prevention. Finally, higher risk procedures should be limited in these cases. Appropriate PPE should be worn by HCWs at all time, and if worn properly, disease transmission is low risk [67, 69, 70] . . Most cases during the SARS and avian influenza epidemic appeared to have occurred when HCWs did not wear the appropriate PPE.",

In 2015 and 2016, a Zika virus outbreak occurred in the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. Besides infection through mosquito bites, documented infection has occurred through maternal fetal transmission, sexual intercourse, organ transplantation, and handling on infected bodily fluids (e.g. laboratory personnel) [34, 44, 45]. Zika virus RNA has been detected in blood, urine, semen, saliva, female genital tract secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. Clinical manifestations of Zika virus infection occur in approximately 20 percent of patients andinclude acute onset of low-grade fever with maculopapular pruritic rash, arthralgia (notably small joints of hands and feet), or conjunctivitis (nonpurulent)[34,44,45]. Infection has been associated with neurologic complications including. Congenital microcephaly (in addition to other developmental problems among babies born to women infected during pregnancy), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myelitis, and meningoencephalitis. The diagnosis of Zika virus infection is definitively established by RT-PCR for virus RNA (in serum, urine, or whole blood) or virus serology. Treatment for Zika virus is supportive[34,44,45].",

In areas of high prevalence, testing can help confirm the diagnosis in individuals with fever, cough and other symptoms of COVID-19[17, 63, 64, 68]. However, in areas of low prevalence, testing should befocused in individuals whom have had close contact with a know case of COVID-19 or have traveled form an area of high prevalence. Given the worldwide spread, targeted testing for individuals of may not be indicated and anyone with suggestive signs and symptoms should be tested[17, 63, 64, 68]. Infection control interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 include universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions and universal masking), early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease (droplet or airborne precaustions), the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with COVID-19, and environmental disinfection. Limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of care in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19. For traveling healthcare workers, an infrastructure of testing, isolation, and appropriate PPE is essential to decrease transmission to workers. In cases where inappropriate PPE is available, avoidance of work or travel is recommended. Given the ongoing changes and evolving data around SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, global health care workers will need to follow some common guidelines to ensure safety for their equipment, patients, and team[17, 64, 66, 67, 69]. These include: Pre-trip preparations: \u2022 All members of a team travel healthcare should have a symptom screen prior to departure. If a fever is present along with cough, conjunctivitis, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue, a nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR should be performed \u2022 Workers leaving from a high prevalence area (>10% infection), should have testing performed regardless of symptoms \u2022 Any worker with a positive test result should not travel. Return to travel or work should only be performed when symptoms free for 72 hours or 2 successive negative tests 24 hours apart.",
