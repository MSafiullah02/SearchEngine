Cytokines may also be synthesized by several other immune or non-immune cells including lymphocytes, neutrophils and fibroblasts. The expression of cytokines following engagement of PRRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) constitutes the main pathway involved in the activation of macrophages (Zhang and Mosser, 2008). Some cytokines may also act as inhibitors of macrophage activation. For example, interleukin (IL)-12, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 act as potent activators of macrophages, whereas IL-10 inhibits activation of these cells (Mitchell and Kumar, 2004).",

The proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, are of greatest importance during the innate immune response (Biron and Sen, 2001). IFN-\u03b1 also participates in the innate response through antiviral activity, by inducing the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into IFN-\u03b3 secreting effector cells and by down-regulation of IL-12 expression (Biron and Sen, 2001, Tizard, 2008). In contrast, IL-10 is considered to be an immunosuppressive cytokine as it down-regulates the expression of several other cytokines including IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 itself, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 (Biron and Sen, 2001, Moore et al., 2001).",

Another study of a PRRSV modified-live vaccine has shown that up-regulation of IL-10 expression is associated with a lower number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells amongst peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (D\u00edaz et al., 2006).",

Twenty eight animals were randomly assigned to groups of four and inoculated by the intramuscular route with 1 ml of the third passage of PRRSV field isolate 2982 (kindly provided by Dr. E. Mateu) at 103.0 TCID50. The virus was initially isolated in porcine alveolar macrophages from the serum of naturally infected piglets during a respiratory outbreak of PRRS affecting a Spanish farm. This field isolate has an open reading frame-5 sequence similarity of 93% with Lelystad virus (GenBank accession number EF429108). The inoculated animals were killed at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21 and 24 days post-inoculation (dpi). Another group of four pigs were sham-inoculated controls. These animals were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of sterile RPMI 1640 medium and killed at the end of the study (24 dpi). All animals were sedated with tiletamine-zolazepam (Zoletil\u2122; Virbac, Barcelona, Spain) followed by a lethal dose of 5% sodium thiopental (Thiovet\u2122; Vet Limited, Leyland, Lancashire).

PRRSV replication peaked at 7 dpi and was mainly localized to alveolar macrophages, which are considered as the target cell for viral replication (Molitor et al., 1997, Bautista and Molitor, 1999). No correlation was observed between the presence of viral antigen and the severity of the microscopical lung lesions. However, the microscopical lung lesions were significantly correlated with marked inflammatory infiltration of the septa and the number of infiltrating macrophages. Moreover, the lung lesions showed significant correlation with the expression of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6, but not of TNF-\u03b1, and macrophage counts were correlated with the expression of IL-1\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1, but not of IL-6. These observations suggest that IL-1\u03b1 may play a significant role in the development of interstitial pneumonia during PRRS. Nonetheless, when all the three proinflammatory cytokines were considered, a highly significant correlation was observed between both microscopical pulmonary lesions and macrophage counts.",

In the present study there was good correlation between the expression of IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, but poor correlation between expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Therefore, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1 might be the most significant cytokines involved in the induction of synthesis of IFN-\u03b3 in this experimental infection. Royaee et al.

IL-10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is able to inhibit the synthesis and release of other cytokines (Biron and Sen, 2001, Moore et al., 2001). Therefore, the expression of IL-10 observed in the present study might be responsible for reduced expression of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1, that in turn may impair prolonged viral replication in the lung of infected animals. Interestingly, the expression of IL-10 was observed in areas of lung that showed no expression of IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, the expression of IL-10 was significantly correlated with PRRSV replication. These results suggest that PRRSV may induce the expression of IL-10 and, therefore, the expression of IL-10 might inhibit the expression of other cytokines, allowing a prolonged viral replication in the lung. This idea is supported by the observed immunolabelling for IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 in consecutive sections of the lung and by the correlation observed between the expression of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b1.",
