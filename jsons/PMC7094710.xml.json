            "text": "Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by Iijima in 1991 [1], they have been widely studied, with the different properties of single walled (SWCNT), double walled and multiple walled CNTs being characterized, and gained a great number of applications, such as in electronic circuits (especially SWCNTs), nanocomposites, sensor devices, smart textiles and drug delivery systems. However, CNTs are poorly solvated in any solvent but rather they tend to aggregate due to the van der Waals\u2019 interactions between the CNTs. Therefore, surface modification of CNTs is required to overcome this vital problem. Both covalent and noncovalent surface modifications have been shown to be effective approaches and provide a wide variety of functional groups on the surface of CNTs, improving the dispersion efficiency and the stability of modified CNTs in aqueous solution [2], [3]. Whilst covalent modifications may be unsuitable for SWCNT due to the creation of \u2018holes\u2019 in the wall, noncovalent surface modification has been found to be an effective way to preserve the integrity of SWCNTs and in particular their electronic properties [4]. However, to accelerate the optimal development and application of CNTs, it is required to understand at the molecular level how polysaccharide biopolymers, such as chitosan, can provide a high dispersion efficiency and stability of CNTs in aqueous solution through wrapping on the outer surface of the CNTs including SWCNTs [5].",

Recently, Iamsamai et al. reported that chitosan with a 61% degree of deacetylation (DD) is more favorably adsorbed onto the surface of CNTs than that of 93% DD chitosan, possibly because of their cumulative hydrophobic parts [24]. In addition, CNTs wrapped with 61% DD chitosan (cwCNT) were found to be highly dispersed and remain stable at aqueous concentrations of more than 1 mM. However, no explanation at the molecular level for that behavior in aqueous solutions is currently available.",

The 60%DD chitosan containing 12 d-glucosamine (GLS or G) and 8 N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAG or N) with the random symmetric sequence of GGNGNGNGNGGNGNGNGNGG was used in this study. The three models, as shown in Figure 1\n, are (a) two pristine SWCNTs (pCNT\u2013pCNT), (b) a pristine SWCNT \u2013 chitosan wrapped SWCNT (pCNT\u2013cwCNT), and (c) two chitosan wrapped SWCNTs (cwCNT\u2013cwCNT). Each model was solvated in an aqueous solution. To neutralize the pCNT\u2013cwCNT and cwCNT\u2013cwCNT systems, the chloride ions were added using the LEaP module of AMBER. The MD simulations were set up and carried out as previously reported [25]. The SWCNTs and chitosan were parameterized by AMBER03 [30] and GLYCAM06 [31] force fields, respectively. The SPC/E water model, with an octagonal box over 12 \u00c5 from the surface of the CNTs or chitosan\u2013CNT complexes, was applied. Then the solvated box edges were set to 68.0, 80.4 and 91.6 \u00c5 in the pCNT\u2013pCNT, pCNT\u2013cwCNT and cwCNT\u2013cwCNT systems, respectively. The simulations were calculated using the amber10 program package [32] with the NPT ensemble (constant number of atoms, pressure and temperature) at 1 atm and a time step of 2 fs. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms to constraint their motions. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and the cutoff function was set at 12 \u00c5 for nonbonded interactions with the particle mesh Ewald method. The whole system was heated from 10 to 300 K for 200 ps and equilibrated at 300 K for 5 ns. Finally, the production stage was performed until 20 ns and the structural coordinates were saved every 1 ps for analysis.",

This means that the hydrophobic acetyl group of NAG can approach closer to and interact with the outer surface of the SWCNTs through van der Waals interactions than the hydrophilic ammonium group (GLS). Similarly for the cwCNT\u2013cwCNT system (Figure 3b), the maximum RDF for the NAG (5.6 \u00c5, black line) takes place at a shorter distance than that of the GLS (6.2 \u00c5, gray line) with a higher density and coordination number. It is interesting that these N(NAG)\u2013C(CNT) and N(GLS)\u2013C(CNT) distances of the cwCNT\u2013cwCNT system are longer than those of the pCNT\u2013cwCNT system, respectively. This fact can be explained using the molecular configurations shown in Figure 2e and f, as that the chitosan in the highly soluble cwCNT\u2013cwCNT system can be accessed by water molecules much more easily than in the aggregated pCNT\u2013cwCNT system. This solvation effect then pulls the chitosan fragments in the cwCNT\u2013cwCNT system out to a longer distance from the SWCNT outer surface than that of the pCNT\u2013cwCNT one.",
