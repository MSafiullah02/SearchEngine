This maintained the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and minimised risk of aerosolisation from the disconnected TT. Potential contamination was also reduced by disconnecting the breathing circuit distal to the anti-viral HME filter. Intraoperative suctioning was performed through an inline suction catheter to avoid open suctioning which carries high aerosolising risks.",

This was useful because communication amongst staff was hampered with the use of the PAPR. Prior to the incision of the trachea, the surgeon clearly communicated to the anaesthetist who administered an additional dose of atracurium 20 mg. The patient was oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Ventilation was held once an incision was made in the trachea and resumed only after inserting and inflating the cuff of the tracheostomy tube.6 Despite preoxygenation, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation dropped transiently to \u223c 80% during the procedure. It is important to recognize that these patients have poor reserves and the importance of ensuring a smooth tube exchange process by prior drills before an actual case. The surgery proceeded uneventfully, and the patient was transferred back to the ICU postoperatively.",

The direction of airflow is determined by pressure differences between the OT and the surrounding rooms, and these pressure gradients are maintained with interlocking doors (Supplementary Fig. 1). Passing through the interlocking doors can take up to 20 s, therefore the anaesthetic drug trolley, resuscitation and airway equipment are placed in the preparation room (one door away) for easy access.4\n",
