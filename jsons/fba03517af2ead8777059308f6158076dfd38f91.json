Although the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil may be beneficial during a chronic inflammatory illness, the same antiinflammatory properties can suppress the inflammatory responses necessary to combat acute viral infection. Given that (n-3) fatty acid-rich fish oil supplementation is on the rise and with the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic, we tested the effect of fish oil feeding for 2 wk on the immune response to influenza virus infection. Male C57BL/6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil/corn oil diet (4 g fish oil:1 g corn oil, wt:wt at 5 g/100 g diet) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function. Although fish oil-fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls, fish oil feeding also resulted in a 40% higher mortality rate, a 70% higher lung viral load at d 7 post infection, and a prolonged recovery period following infection. Although splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity was suppressed in fish oil-fed mice, lung NK activity was not affected. Additionally, lungs of infected fish oil-fed mice had significantly fewer CD8 + T cells and decreased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1-a, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-6. These results suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil feeding can alter the immune response to influenza infection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. 4 Abbreviations used: FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; MIP-1a, macrophage inflammatory protein-1-a; NK, natural killer; PE, phycoerythrin; p.i., postinfection; TCID 50 , tissue culture infectious dose 50; TNFa, tumor necrosis factor-a. 0022-3166/08 $", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1609, "end": 1610, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Dietary long-chain PUFA derived from fish oil have been shown to have beneficial effects on chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (1, 2) and long-chain PUFA such as eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3) ] and docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3)] appear to be most beneficial (3, 4) .

At least 5 3 10 5 cells were stained with the following anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies: FITC anti-CD3, APCanti-CD4 and peridinin-chlorophyll-protein anti-CD8, PE anti-CD11b and FITC anti-GR-1 (BD Biosciences). Cell populations were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). T cells were identified using the follow antibodies: FITC-anti-CD3, APC-anti-CD4, and peridinin-chlorophyll-protein-anti-CD8 and neutrophils: PE anti-CD11b and FITC anti-GR-1(35).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Percent body weight change in mice fed control or fish oil diets following influenza infection.
