As summarized by Wiley (2010), in 1995, Schmidt (a medical doctor) was accused of injecting his former mistress (Janet Allen, a nurse) with HIV-positive blood from one of his patients. Allen and Schmidt had been romantically involved for a decade, and Schmidt had been giving her regular vitamin injections. After threatening to break off the affair, Allen found that she was HIV positive and accused Schmidt of substituting tainted blood for one of her injections.",

But unlike a poison, HIV has genetic material (RNA) and makes copies of itself, meaning that it can evolve. In fact, because of its high mutation rate and rapid replication rate, HIV evolves remarkably quickly. While the process of speciation may take tens or hundreds of thousands of years in animals like fruit flies, HIV can diversify into many different strains within a single individual in less than a year (Fig. 1). As HIV evolves, it accumulates mutations in its genome\u2014some beneficial to the virus (and likely, bad for human hosts!), some slightly deleterious to the virus, and most with no notable effect at all. Whatever their impact, those mutations record events in the lineage\u2019s history, turning the genome into something of a marked-up road map\u2014a spotty, but informative, account of where the lineage has been at different points in its evolutionary past. This makes it possible for scientists to use the virus\u2019s RNA sequence to reconstruct the family relationships among different strains (i.e., to build a phylogeny).",

The biologists sequenced different regions of the viral RNA and used these data to build phylogenies. Figure 2 shows the phylogeny they built using part of the HIV reverse transcriptase gene. Every HIV strain sequence is different, but the phylogeny shows how they are related. The victim\u2019s sequences are most closely related to those of the doctor\u2019s HIV-positive patient and are much more distantly related to other HIV strains. Even more convincingly, the victim\u2019s sequences are nested within the clade formed by the patient\u2019s sequences; they are a subset of the patient\u2019s sequences. This is exactly what we would expect to observe if the patient was infected with HIV, the virus evolved into many different strains within him, and then the victim was infected with one of the patient\u2019s strains, and the virus continued to evolve within her. Based partly on the strength of phylogenetic evidence such as this, the doctor was convicted of attempted murder in 1998 (Vogel 1996).",

The biologists compared the sequences from the children to many other known HIV sequences and used them to build a phylogeny (Fig. 3; de Oliveira et al. 2006). That tree revealed that the children\u2019s viruses formed a tight-knit family\u2014as would be expected if they stemmed from a single introduction of HIV to the hospital, which was then passed to many different patients. Based on the viral strains most closely related to the children\u2019s (one strain from Ghana and two from Cameroon), the strain in question seems to have come from West Africa. Many West African migrants come to Libya seeking work. It seems likely that the virus was accidentally introduced to the hospital when an infected worker or a worker's infected child was treated there.",

This analysis was based on a molecular clock, the idea that in certain stretches of DNA or RNA, mutations accumulate at a reliable rate (e.g., one per year), allowing them to be used as timers: the more mutations the genetic material has accumulated, the longer since it split off from its ancestral sequence. The molecular clock analysis of the children\u2019s HIV sequences convincingly showed that the medics could not have caused the disease cluster. The medics arrived at the hospital in March of 1998. If the medics had intentionally infected the children, the first victims would have been infected after the medics\u2019 arrival\u2014and hence, the victims\u2019 viruses would have begun to diverge from one another and from other viral lineages after March of 1998 (as shown in Scenario 1, Fig. 4). But when the biologists traced the family tree of the children\u2019s viruses back in time, that\u2019s not what they found. Instead they discovered a phylogeny resembling that shown in Scenario 2 (Fig. 4); the children\u2019s viruses were so different from one another that they must have begun diverging long before 1998.

Does the market for whale meat in Japan encourage illegal whaling and trading of whale products? The answer is hard to figure out simply by visiting Japanese fish markets.

The researchers sequenced part of a mitochondrial gene from each meat sample, compared them to sequences from known whale populations, and used these data to build a phylogeny showing how all the sequences are related (Fig. 5; Baker and Palumbi 1994). Many of the sequences from the \u201cwhale\u201d meat are closely related to sequences from whales that cannot be sold legally in Japan. That meat likely came from protected species, although the researchers dutifully noted that some of this meat might be considered legal if it had been kept in storage since before the restrictions were enacted\u2014between four and 27 years! In addition, the analysis suggested that some of the \u201cwhale\u201d meat could be dangerous to consumers; some meat appeared to come from dolphins, which eat higher on the food chain than baleen whales and so are more likely to contain dangerous levels of mercury.",

However, further searches failed to turn up more tainted civets, suggesting that these animals were not the original source of the virus.

As a simplified example, imagine that a federal agency only has the resources to create a preserve in one of three river basins (Fig. 8). Each river basin happens to support four related fish species. If we want to conserve biodiversity and focus simply on the number of fish species, there is little difference between the three rivers. Now imagine that we reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among fish and build the phylogeny shown in Fig. 9. Even though each basin contains the same number of fish species, basin C includes more distantly related species. If we focus conservation efforts on basin C, we will preserve more evolutionary history and likely more genetic variation and evolutionary potential for the future.",

They wondered if some plants might be more important than others in preserving a functional ecosystem. They reasoned that the biomass produced by plants might be a particularly important indicator of a diverse, functioning ecosystem. After all, more biomass translates into more plant mass providing food for animals, producing oxygen, and absorbing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the scientists suspected that the evolutionary relationships among an ecosystem\u2019s plants help determine the amount of biomass they can produce. An ecosystem based on distantly related plants might be more productive than one based on closely related plants, they reasoned, since the distant relatives are more likely to have evolved to occupy distinct niches.",

This finding supports the idea that, if we want to preserve functioning ecosystems, we should prioritize conserving evolutionarily distant species. For example, if forced to choose, we may want to put our resources into protecting species like the buttercup, which occupies a longer branch on the tree of life than its closely related grassland neighbors, sunflowers, and daisies.",
