According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online (https://doi.org/10.6084/ m9.figshare.11493666.v1). This paper has been submitted to IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2020, and its extended version is submitted to IEEE Internet of Things journal. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify",

The continual use of radar has the potential risk of the explosion to released radiation [8] . Thermal imaging cameras are susceptible to ambient heat [9, 10] . The method based on motion detection is able to solve the above problems, because its measurement is based on the variation in displacement instead of the changes in pixel intensity. Depth camera is a good method based on motion detection which has been widely utilized in the acquisition and analysis of respiratory signals [11, 12] .

Therefore, the classification of respiratory signals extracted by the non-contact measurement system with the aid of deep learning is a study worth trying and of much significance. In the above study, all the data sets required for model construction were obtained, though, by assessing the respiratory activities of the test subjects. This approach for capturing different types of respiratory patterns yields a limited set of data. Were there no large amount of training data to support, the neural network might not be able to give full play to its advantages. Furthermore, researchers often present studies that the classification models generally adopt the general network architecture in the field of deep learning without specific designs for respiratory pattern classification. At the same time, the network is not optimized according to the characteristics of the collected data.",

Attention: Attention RNN has been widely applied in document classification [21] , speech recognition [22] and relation classification [23] . In above studies, the attention mechanism is used to express the importance of words in sentences or sentences in documents. In our taskclassification of respiratory patterns, each point in the respiratory waveform is of different importance when determining certain respiratory pattern. Therefore, we add attentional mechanism into GRU, which can be expressed by following equations: where h t is the state at time t, which contains bidirectional information extracted from the waveform; W a and b a are the parameters obtained by training phase. First, a tanh function is used to obtain the hidden representation u t . Then normalized importance weight \u03b1 t is obtained through a sof tmax function. V a is also a parameter obtained by training processing and it can be understood as the importance of one specific point to the certain respiration pattern. Finally, the sum of product of \u03b1 t and h t at each point is calculated to obtain the output of the attention layer, which is denoted as S. S here is high-level representation of certain waveform for classification. Output layer uses the output S of the attention layer to classify respiratory patterns. In training stage, we encoded the label in one-hot format and cross-entropy was adopted as loss function.",

Among them, there were 108 groups of Eupnea, Bradypnea and Tachypnea; 97 groups of Cheyne-stokes and Central-Apnea and 87 groups of Biots. Some wrong real-world respiration patterns were eliminated. We trained BI-AT-GRU, BI-AT-LSTM, GRU and LSTM with the same training set with sample size of 120,000. The performance of these models was verified by the same test set (605 samples). Results demonstrated in Table 1 . It can be seen from Table 1 : 1) four metrics of BI-AT-GRU are higher than other models, and models with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms perform better than their basic networks; 2) GRU based networks perform slightly better than LSTM based in our task; and 3) the classification accuracy of all networks maintain a high level, proving the feasibility of training the network with RSM data. In the confusion matrix of each model (Fig. 3) , we can see that the classification error mainly came from prediction of Cheyne-Stokes to be Central-Apnea. The possible reason is that these patterns are only different in breathing depth, which reflected in amplitude of the waveform. While in normalization processing, amplitude of respiratory signal is sensitive to the time window. In addition, the movement of subjects body can lead to mutations of amplitude, thus increasing the error rate. It can be seen that BI-AT-GRU has the lowest error rate, which is an important reason why it performs best. Moreover, performances of BI-AT-GRU and BI-AT-LSTM are better than their basic networks, indicating the contribution of these two mechanisms. ",
