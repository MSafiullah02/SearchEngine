            "text": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of mortality, and the most common nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) [1]. According to the US National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system, one-third of all nosocomial infections in ICUs are pneumonia; of these, 83% are associated with mechanical ventilation [2]. Common pathogens of VAP include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii [3]. Patients who acquire VAP have poorer outcomes, higher mortality rates, and longer lengths of hospital stay than uninfected patients [4]. Delays in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment for VAP significantly increase mortality [5]. Patients with suspected VAP should undergo a serial evaluation that includes chest X-ray, sputum Gram stain, sputum cultures, and blood cultures. The sputum Gram stain is not reliable for the early application of antibiotic therapy. Sputum culture requires a long culture duration, and the results might not correlate well with the real causative pathogen [6]. Mechanically ventilated (MV) patients usually empirically receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to control a suspected infection at the earliest time, which may result in the development of resistance [7]. Early diagnosis for VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. However, current culture-based microbiological diagnosis is inadequate for the timely prescription of targeted antibiotics. The development of a rapid test to diagnose VAP is therefore important to solve these problems [8].",

According to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, as many as 34 volatile metabolites were released from Streptococcus pneumoniae and 28 from Haemophilus influenzae in vitro, comprising alcohols, aldehydes, esters, hydrocarbons, ketones, and sulfur-containing compounds [10]. In an animal study, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from the breath of mice with lung infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were also detectable in cultures in vitro [11]. These findings were also noted in some human studies conducted in VAP with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Acinetobacter baumannii infection [12, 13]. The findings suggested that discrimination of the VOCs derived from pathogens might provide a noninvasive breath test for the diagnosis of VAP.",

            "text": "A novel sensor array technique has been developed to discriminate the VOCs in breath [14]. The estimated number of metabolites in humans ranges from a low of 2000\u20133000 to a high of approximately 20,000 [15]. It is difficult to qualitatively and quantitatively measure all the VOCs by GC-MS because most of the compounds are still unknown. To discriminate the VOCs associated with diseases, there is increasing interest in using an electronic nose to address the problem [14]. An electronic nose uses sensor responses to measure VOCs. During the measurements, the VOCs attach to the sensor polymer surface to induce swelling of the polymer film. The swelling increases the electrical resistance of the composite, which generates an electrical signal. The sensor array response data are subsequently used as predictors to create a diagnostic classification algorithm [16]. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been gradually used in medicine to assist physicians in making clinical diagnoses [17]. Machine learning technology is commonly used in the analysis of sensor response data because an electronic nose is a composite of a sensor array and functionally resembles biological olfactory receptors by pattern recognition. However, the process of building algorithms is usually a \u201cblack box\u201d, and the results are over optimized in many studies, preventing physicians from applying them in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are therefore warranted. The objective of this study was to use sensor array signals to diagnose VAP using the machine learning technique. Using this study as an example, we demonstrated our procedures to build machine learning algorithms and assess their accuracy for facilitating the application of AI in medicine.",

The air was analyzed using the Cyranose 320 electronic nose (Sensigent, CA, USA), which has 32 thin-film nanocomposite sensors. For each of the 32 sensors, ten consecutive measurements from the same breath were collected to obtain a mean value for analysis after the deletion of the first measurements according to the manufacturer\u2019s suggestion [21]. Because the expiratory flow rate would significantly affect the measurement [22], a constant flow rate of 120 cc/min was standardized for all measurements. The Cyranose 320 uses conducting polymer arrays, which might be influenced by the temperature of the sample gas. Therefore, we maintained a constant temperature of 20\u201322 degrees Celsius during all analyses. We analyzed all samples in the same room with a fixed temperature and humidity. The room air pumped into the electronic nose was analyzed to provide the baseline sensor response (R0). The raw data were normalized and autoscaled to eliminate background noise and exclude outliers [22, 23] and then used to derive the prediction model.\n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{Sensor}\\ \\mathrm{response}:\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{R}}{R_o}=\\frac{\\left({R}_{max}-{R}_0\\right)}{R_0}. $$\\end{document}Sensor response:\u0394RRo=Rmax-R0R0.",

The training set was used to generate the model. We used the modelLookup function of the caret package for automated parameter tuning to improve model performance [24]. Then, the optimized models were further tested in an independent testing set to evaluate the accuracy. To prevent unequal distribution in the proportion of cases in each group, we applied the oversampling method that replicates the observations a from minority class to balance the data [25]. Using the confusion matrix, we determined the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction rate, and negative prediction value [26]. In this study, we used eight machine learning algorithms to establish the prediction models, including k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, decision tree, neural network, support vector machines (SVMs) (including linear kernel, polynomial kernel, and radial basis kernel), and random forest.\n",

To adjust accuracy by accounting for the possibility of a correct prediction by chance only, which is especially important for datasets with class imbalance, we also calculated the kappa statistics [27] Kappa expresses the extent to which the observed agreement exceeds that which would be expected by chance alone. A kappa greater than 0.75 represents excellent agreement beyond chance, a kappa below 0.40 represents poor agreement, and a kappa of 0.40 to 0.75 represents intermediate to good agreement. We used a bootstrap method and calculated the accuracy of 100 iterations to decide the parameters of machine learning methods that had the highest prediction accuracy.
