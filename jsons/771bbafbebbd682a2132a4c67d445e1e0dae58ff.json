            "text": "Microbial contamination is mainly of faecal origin, especially for SS or MSW. For example, 1-4% of the dry weight of MSW consists of soiled disposable diapers (Pahren and Clark 1987 ; Gerba et al. 1995) . As most of the contaminating micro-organisms are heat-sensitive, they disappear during composting, leading to a faecal pathogen-free end product. This disappearance is defined as disinfection or sanitization. Sanitization through the composting process has already been studied for SS (Clark et al. 1984 ; Epstein 1985, 1989 ; Schwartzbrod et al. 1990 ). Several authors have quantified the pathogens of concern in SS (Schwartzbrod et al. 1986 ; Goldstein et al. 1988 ; Strauch et al. 1991 ; Straub et al. 1993) and their evolution during composting (Nell et al. 1983 ; De Bertoldi 1988 ; Schwartzbrod et al. 1990 ; Strauch 1991) . In contrast, MSW composting has received little attention. Pathogens found in MSW, as in SS, can be viruses, bacteria, protozoa or helminths (Table 1) . As they are heat-sensitive, the heat increase occurring during the composting process should eliminate them. Several parameters (e.g. humidity and oxygen) have an influence on the heat increase. For this reason, sanitization efficiency depends on the composting method used (Pereira-Neto et al. 1986 , 1987 .",

Faecal streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae are most often used for this purpose. Faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci are good candidates for assessing MSW compost hygienization .

In this study, total coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli, total streptococci and faecal streptococci were tested as indicators of pathogen inactivation.",

During storage, pH of the uncovered compost rose while that of the covered compost remained stable (Table  3 ). This could be explained by a faster evolution towards maturity in the uncovered compost heap (Mustin 1987) . Maturity is the final stage of the composting process.

Seasonal variation in the microbiological composition of human faeces has already been described (MacGowan et al. 1994) . However, faecal contamination of MSW seemed to be mainly of non-human origin. The faecal coliform/faecal streptococci ratio (FC/FS) is thought to be an index of the faecal contamination origin (Pahren and Clark 1987) ; an FC/FS above 4 may characterize human faeces while a value below 0\u00b76 is characteristic of other warm-blooded animals (i.e. about 0\u00b73 for dogs and 0\u00b702 for cats) (Pahren and Clark 1987) . In this study, the ratios were 0\u00b74 and 0\u00b723 according to the run, suggesting that human faecal contamination was relatively low. However, this result must be considered carefully, as the FC/FS ratio is more suitable in fresh waste because die-off rates are different in both groups. In this study, the time between waste being collected and being sent to the composting chain could reach 5 d. A low human faecal contamination is also supported by other microbial analyses. No Shigella were found in this study because they are linked to human and higher monkeys' digestive tracts and are only occasionally found in other mammalian species (e.g. dogs) (Krieg and Holt 1984) . Ascaris eggs were not recovered during the second run even though they were detected in the first one (Table 6 ). However, Schwartzbrod et al. (1990) have shown that there are few Ascaris eggs in MSW.",

In both runs, MSW stayed at a temperature higher than 50\u00b0C for 10 d (Tables 3 and 4) , and remained at over 60\u00b0C for 5 d. Under these conditions, pathogens disappeared (Tables 5 and 6 ). In both runs, pathogen disappearance and indicator decrease occurred before 21 d. At D 21 in the spring run, the compost cohort was set in W 4 , whereas in the summer run it was set in W 12 , clearly indicating that the governing factors are time and temperature and not the type of windrow.",

In our study, we observed the disappearance of Salmonella and Ascaris eggs at higher faecal streptococci concentrations than those proposed by Zucconi and De Bertoldi (1987) . However, these results are difficult to compare as microbiological analysis methods were not standardized. For example, in this study, the recovery rate for faecal streptococci was 21% when distilled water was used for the compost suspension. When the other solution (water, phosphate buffer) or sonication was tested for suspension of the compost before serial dilution, bacterial counts varied five or 10-fold (unpublished data). It is also important to note that the recovery rate was assessed for a single bacterial population and it is not known what it would be in a heterogeneous bacterial environment. However, the recovery rate observed was not unexpected (EPA 1992) .",

At D 174 and D 242 , the situation was different, as in both heaps there was a rise in coliforms only. This bacterial regrowth was smaller in covered compost, probably because of the higher temperature and lower humidity . Only coliforms showed regrowth, emphasizing the need to combine several indicators or pathogens in order to assess sanitization. Had coliforms been measured alone, this regrowth could have been misinterpreted as an external contamination; streptococci are unlikely to regrow in compost (EPA 1992) while Salmonella and coliforms are able to do so (Hussong et al. 1985) . This observation suggests that sanitization should be monitored by following Salmonella and faecal streptococci during composting and storage. Coliform monitoring would be unnecessary with regard to hygiene but could be of interest for monitoring compost stability (Soares et al. 1995) .",

Although temperature monitoring is the simplest and most usually recommended method for monitoring hygienization, this study suggests that it is also important to assess hygienization by microbial analysis. Microbial analysis should concern every stage of the composting process, starting from the thermophilic phase and including the storage of the end product. In order to fully assess sanitation, it is important to combine monitoring of both indicators and pathogens because of the risk of confusion between natural regrowth and accidental contamination liable to occur mainly during storage.",
