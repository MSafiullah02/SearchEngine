            "text": "Amino acid residues in a protein have two roles: providing a structural framework (structural residues) and mediating interactions with other biomolecules (functional residues). Identification and annotation of functional residues are fundamental goals in protein characterization (1\u20135). A number of methods have been developed to achieve these goals. Most methods use sequence conservation information, with the assumption that functional residues are often conserved in homologous proteins (6\u20138). The residues identified are then expected to perform functions similar to those of other homologs. Other methods predict functional residues on the basis of the shapes and properties of three-dimensional protein structures (9\u201315). Starting from well-known functional domains (ligand binding, catalytic, etc.), these analyses determine similar local structures and key residues that may be related to the function. Conservation-based methods provide valuable information on protein functional residues but are limited by the insufficient sampling of protein sequence space in natural evolution. It is also challenging for conservation-based methods to assess structural and functional constraints and to assign functionality at the single-residue level (Fig. 1) (16). Therefore, a more direct and systematic method needs to be used for the accurate identification and annotation of functional residues.",

            "text": "Because of their compact genome, viruses usually encode multifunctional proteins, including viral polymerase proteins. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp) is used by many RNA viruses for transcription and replication. Functions of vRdRp can be grouped into two classes: canonical and noncanonical. The canonical vRdRp functions include template and nucleotide binding, initiation, and elongation (17\u201319). Among different classes of RNA viruses, these canonical functions and corresponding protein structural features are conserved (17\u201322). The noncanonical functions of vRdRp, however, are specific to each virus. For example, multimerization of hepatitis C virus (HCV) vRdRp is essential for viral replication. Thus, the interacting residues in HCV vRdRp are noncanonical functional residues specific to HCV (23, 24). Moreover, vRdRp often recruits cellular machinery for replication and plays a role in inhibition of the cellular immune response (25\u201331). Noncanonical functional residues are usually involved in the performance of those functions and thus are essential for viral replication. Noncanonical functional residues in vRdRp are difficult to determine by commonly used methods and are not as well studied as the key residues for polymerase catalytic functions. However, the noncanonical functional residues are indispensable for thorough protein characterization and may act as drug targets. As a result, it is essential to develop methods that enable the identification of noncanonical functional residues.",

Here, we extended this method to annotate functional residues in combination with structural comparison of homologous proteins. The method consists of three steps. First, the effect of PB1 mutations on viral replication at single-nucleotide resolution is examined by saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput sequencing. Second, functional PB1 residues that are essential for viral growth but do not affect protein stability are identified by protein stability prediction. Third, homologous structural alignment is used to further annotate specific biological functions (canonical versus noncanonical functions) for each functional residue (Fig. 1). We achieved high sensitivity in identifying and annotating the canonical polymerase functional residues. Moreover, we also identified noncanonical functional residues, which are exemplified by a cluster of residues located in the loop region of the PB1 \u03b2-ribbon. These previously uncharacterized residues were shown to be important for PB1 protein nuclear import by interacting with Ran-binding protein 5 (RanBP5) (32).",

To provide a more accurate quantification of the fitness effect of single mutations, we employed the \u201csmall-library\u201d method that we recently developed (16). Nine small libraries were generated to cover all of segment 2 (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Each small library was transfected into 293T cells together with seven plasmids that encoded the other wild-type viral segments (39). Reconstituted mutant virus libraries were used to infect A549 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05, and supernatants were collected 24 h postinfection. The input DNA libraries, posttransfection libraries, and postinfection libraries were subjected to Illumina sequencing. To control for technical error and assess library quality, biological duplicates were included in both transfection and subsequent infection steps (Fig. 2A).",

Thirty to 35% of the input DNA library plasmids contained the desired single nucleotide mutations (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). We achieved at least 20,000\u00d7 sequencing coverage for each nucleotide position (see Fig. S1C). The library covered 94.9% of the nucleotides in segment 2 and included 98.2% of the single nucleotide mutations of observed positions (see Fig. S2A and C). To further improve the accuracy of fitness quantification, we focused on the mutations that make up >0.1% of the plasmid mutant library. After this quality control, we were still able to observe 94.2% of the nucleotide positions with 63.9% of the single nucleotide mutations. More than 82% of the nucleotide positions were covered with two or three nucleotide mutations (see Fig. S2B and D in the supplemental material). To assess the quality and reproducibility of our mutant library, we compared the relative frequencies of single mutations between biological replicates. We obtained a strong Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.93 for two independent transfections and 0.75 for infections (Fig. 2B). A relative fitness (RF) index was calculated for individual mutations as the ratio of relative frequency in the infection library to that in the input DNA library. The profiling data of all of segment 2 are shown in Fig. 2C, where most of the mutations had a fitness cost (log10 RF index of <0).",

So we focused on the PB1 protein for downstream analysis. The RF indexes of silent mutations were considered an internal quality control since most, if not all, of them were expected to have a growth capacity comparable to that of the wild type. In the fitness profile of the PB1 protein, the RF indexes of silent mutations followed a normal distribution with a mean of 0.9 and were significantly higher than those of nonsense mutations (two-tailed t test, P = 4.6E-21) (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).

On the basis of the predicted \u0394\u0394G, mutations can be classified as destabilizing (\u0394\u0394G, \u2264\u22120.5), neutral (\u22120.5 < \u0394\u0394G < 0.5), or stabilizing (\u0394\u0394G, \u22650.5). We applied I-Mutant predictions for all missense mutations in PB1 with the structure resolved from the bat influenza A virus polymerase complex (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 4WSB) (46, 47). Of the mutations for which structure information is available, 64.5% were shown to be destabilizing, 33.5% were neutral, and 2% were stabilizing (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). As expected, destabilizing mutations had a significantly small solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) (48\u201350) (see Fig. S5B). To further reduce the rate of false-negative functional residue identification, we performed protein stability prediction with Rosetta for all deleterious mutations (16, 42, 44). Unlike the machine learning algorithm used by I-mutant, Rosetta generated structural models for single amino acid mutations based on a preoptimized wild-type structure. With a high-resolution protocol, 50 models of wild-type and mutant protein structures were generated and the three lowest \u0394\u0394G values were averaged on the basis of optimized rotamers. The absolute correlation coefficient of the predictions that resulted from these two methods was 0.3 (see Fig. S5C). Aiming at getting a conserved classification of functional residues, we classified a residue as functional if it had one or more missense mutations satisfying both the deleterious RF index cutoff and nondestabilizing criteria of \u0394\u0394G predictions from either software. We identified 297 residues as functional.",

Since canonical vRdRp functional residues of the PB1 protein are expected to be structurally conserved, they aligned well with other protein structures from the vRdRp family. Therefore, homologous structural alignment might enable us to further annotate PB1 residues by distinguishing canonical and noncanonical vRdRp functional residues. The recent improvement of algorithms provides opportunities for more accurate structure comparison. Here we used TM-align and 3DCOMB for pairwise and multiple structure alignments (MSAs) (59\u201361). Both softwares use TM-score to quantify protein structural similarity, which is robust to local structural variation and is protein length independent (59, 60). Moreover, 3DCOMB takes into account both local and global features, which is suitable for alignment of distantly related protein structures (61).",

As the reported aligned residues had RMSD scores ceiled at 9, we assigned the residues that did not align among structures with an RMSD value of 10 (Fig. 4A). Low RMSDs meant that the residues were conserved in the vRdRp family and thus more likely to have canonical vRdRp functions. As expected, the structurally conserved residues were less tolerant of mutations. The average RF index of structurally conserved residues was significantly lower than that of nonconserved residues (two-tailed t test, P = 0.0006, Fig. 4B). The RMSDs of all of the identified functional residues of the PB1 protein were plotted. A smooth curve of RMSDs was fitted by local polynomial (loess) regression. We could clearly identify the six conserved domains (pre-A/F and A to E) of vRdRp as valleys on the smooth curve (Fig. 4C).

When mapped onto the protein structure, some of them (residues 180 to 220) formed a noticeable cluster (Fig. 5A and B). This clustered region is unique to the PB1 protein, which consists of a long twisted \u03b2-ribbon connected by a nonstructured loop (47). It protrudes from the polymerase complex structure and is fully solvent exposed. Two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) were reported in the \u03b2-ribbon region (amino acids 187 to 190 and 207 to 210) to mediate PB1 nuclear import through interaction with RanBP5 (32, 83). Nonetheless, the function of this loop region is not completely clear. It is suspected to interact with the viral genome in the resolved influenza B and C virus structures (46, 47, 84), and K198 of influenza A virus was suggested to be related to host adaptation (85). As the density of the loop region (residues 195 to 198) is missing from the influenza A virus polymerase crystal structure, we used kinematic loop modeling in the Rosetta software to computationally reconstruct the loop region (86). From the above-described analysis, D193 in the loop region was identified as a noncanonical functional residue. Interestingly, it was the only negatively charged residue located within a highly positively charged environment. It was 100% conserved among all of the human influenza A virus PB1 sequences from the Influenza Research Database under purifying selection (ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary changes [dN/dS ratio] of 0.015) (87\u201389, 113) (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Two positively charged residues (K197, K198) located on the side opposite D193 in the loop region were also highly conserved in human influenza A viruses (>99%) and possibly interact with D193. Although they were not classified as essential residues according to our high-throughput fitness profile, their mutations in charges (K197E, K198E) resulted in a >6-fold drop in the RF index. To examine if the loop region has possible noncanonical functions, we introduced single substitutions (D193G, K197E, K198E) and double substitutions (D193G-K197E, G193G-K198E, K197E-K198E) into the PB1 protein. We also constructed mutant versions with substitutions in the NLS region (K188A-R189A, R208A-K209A) and mutant versions that decreased the polymerase activity (W55R, H184R, H47L, Q268L) as controls. Of note, all of the controls were identified as deleterious in our high-throughput fitness profile. Viral production of all of the mutant versions was measured by TCID50 assay with viral rescue experiments. D193G, D193G-K197E, G193G-K198E, K197E-K198E, and the reported substitutions in the NLS region (K188A-R189A) had severe impacts on viral production, with no detectable viral titer posttransfection (Fig. 5C) (32). Consistently, these mutations also resulted in a significantly lower viral growth rate in A549 cells (Fig. 5D). To examine the vRdRp function of these mutations, we used a minigenome replicon assay by cotransfecting a virus-inducible luciferase reporter and polymerase segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP) in 293T cells. The reported mutant NLS (K188A-R189A), which was highly deleterious for viral replication, still had ~50% polymerase activity in the minigenome replicon assay. Similarly, D193G and all of the double substitutions (D193G-K197E, D193G-K198E, K197E-K198E) showed discordance between vRdRp function and viral growth capacity. Compared with W55R, H184R, H47L, and Q268L, which remained at ~0.1 to 65% polymerase activity, the fitness drop caused by these newly identified loop mutations was much more severe, indicating that they might have a noncanonical polymerase function of PB1 (Fig. 5C).",

A549 cells were infected with wild-type and mutant viruses at an MOI of 0.1. Cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) at 18 h postinfection. As expected, the PB1 proteins of the wild-type virus were localized mostly in the nucleus. However, the PB1 proteins of mutant viruses were significantly enriched in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these mutations were defective in PB1 protein nuclear import (Fig. 6A and B). More severe defects were observed for double mutations (D193G-K197E, K197E-K198E). Similar results were observed at earlier time points (8 h postinfection) at an MOI of 0.5 (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, for those PB1 mutant versions, the nuclear import of PA protein was also delayed, which is consistent with the notion that PA and PB1 are imported into the nucleus as a complex (32, 83, 90, 91) (see Fig. S7).",

Thus, we further tested if mutations in the loop region (D193G, D193G-K197E, and K197E-K198E) would also affect the interaction between PB1 and RanBP5. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed by cotransfecting the FLAG-tagged PB1 protein and the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RanBP5 protein into 293T cells. Two days later, the total cell lysate was collected and subjected to IP with anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads or IgG-conjugated beads. As shown in Fig. 6B, all three mutant proteins showed decreased binding with RanBP5. Consistent with our IFA results, double mutations (D193G-K197E, K197E-K198E) produced a greater reduction in protein binding.

Although their sequence identity is ~20%, they have adopted similar structural domains and use similar catalytic mechanisms (20). Throughout evolution, different proteins also evolved diverse functions to satisfy the needs of specific organisms. Thus, the specific structural motifs that differentiate one protein from homologous proteins may have organism-specific functions. Here we used homologous protein structure information to further annotate the diverse protein functions. Therefore, a multifunctional protein might harbor both canonical (evolutionarily conserved) and noncanonical (organism-specific) functions.

Unlike other RNA viruses, influenza A virus performs its genome replication inside the nucleus. Thus, the polymerase complex needs to be translocated into the nucleus to perform its function. It is known that PB1 and PA are translocated together as a complex, while PB2 can be translocated by itself (101). RanBP5 is important for the nuclear import of PB1 and PA through direct interaction with PB1. Besides the two reported NLSs, we show that the mutations in the loop region also impact the interaction between PB1 and RanBP5, thus causing the defect in PB1 nuclear import. We do not have direct evidence that the loop region works as a direct NLS or by affecting the nearby NLS regions, but on the basis of the sequence of the loop region, it did not fall into any of the six classes of NLSs (32, 102). Thus, we suspected that this region affected PB1 nuclear import by affecting the nearby NLS regions. In agreement with previous observations, there seems to be no clear consensus sequence that is responsible or important for RanBP5 binding (32, 103). The detailed mechanism needs to be further defined.",

Coupling mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing, high-throughput fitness profiling provides a sensitive and unbiased way to identify the essential residues of targeted proteins (16, 33\u201337, 104\u2013107). The same principle applies to other proteins/organisms, as long as the proper functional measurement can be made (37). For example, we can study the proteins related to cell proliferation by using the cell growth rate as a readout. By using saturated mutagenesis, we can learn which mutation is related to an abnormal cell growth rate and can further use flow cytometry to differentiate cells in different phases. We can also investigate the roles of mutant proteins in cancer metastasis through transwell migration assays in vitro or by using mouse xenograft models in vivo. The structures of target or homologous proteins can be linked to a genetic profile and further facilitate the understanding of biomolecular functions related to each functional residue. We foresee that this approach will become more powerful as more protein structures are determined at an accelerated rate by crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy and the escalating sequencing technology.",

The conservation-based method is commonly used to identify and annotate functional protein residues, but it has three major limitations. First, it is limited by the insufficient sampling of protein functional space in natural evolution. Second, it is challenging for this method to dissect residues with structural or functional constraints. Lastly, it is limited to distinguishing the diverse functions within the same protein. The method we present here may overcome these limitations and provide a systematic way to annotate functional residues. Using high-throughput fitness profiling, we can identify essential residues for viral replication. Through mutant protein stability prediction, we are able to dissect the structural and functional constraints. Homologous structural analysis is used to further annotate canonical and noncanonical functional residues.",
