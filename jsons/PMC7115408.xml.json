            "text": "Drug resistance in microbial and viral infections has become a marked problem causing the failure of many treatments. The constant search for new drugs to be used alone or in combination with existing market drugs has become a necessity. In continuation of our efforts in finding such drug candidates, we have focused on the investigation of 2-oxonicotinonitrile (2-ONN) derivatives containing two aryl groups at the four- and six- positions of the ring. The 2-ONN ring contains the biologically important, naturally occurring 2-pyridinone motif [1], [2]. This motif has been found in compounds that are human immune deficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [3], [4], [5], anti-herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) agents [6], hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitors [7], and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents [8]. In addition to their antiviral activity, 2-pyridinone derivatives are known to possess activity against wild type [9], [10] and resistant [11] bacterial strains. The derivatives have also been shown to be antifungal [12] and antiprotozoal agents [13], [14].",

The 2-ONN ring was attached to 2-pyridyl (Py) and p-chlorophenyl (PhCl) groups in 1a, to 2-thienyl (Th) and 4-isopropylphenyl (PhPr) groups in 1b, and to two Th groups in 1c. Compounds 1a\n[18] and 1c\n[19] were reported to be prepared through their respective chalcones in two steps from the aldehyde and ketone. However, the one-pot method that we adapted afforded a shorter route for their synthesis. Compounds 1a\u2013c were obtained as the amido tautomer as suggested by the presence of bands in the IR spectrum characteristic for NH and C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO of the amide functional group. This was also emphasized by the presence of an 1H NMR peak at a chemical shift higher than 12 ppm, corresponding to the amide NH. Obtaining the amido tautomer rather than the imido was explained by a recent study showing that the amido tautomer was more stable and hence predominant [20].",

Keeping these contradicting results in mind, one can envision that regioselectivity of the reaction depends on the size of both the coupling agent and the substituents on the 2-ONN ring. Additionally, the type and relative positions of the aryl substituents on the ring induce an electronic effect that contributes to the relative electron density at the ring N and 2-oxo positions, which in turn controls the regioselectivity. It is to be noted that careful chromatographic separation of products of such reactions show that both N- and O-glycosylation/alkylation can occur, with one of them as the major product [26].",

Reaction progress was monitored by TLC analysis using aluminium-backed plates pre-coated with Merck silica gel 60 F254. Spots separated on the TLC plates were visualized by UV light and/or charring with a solution of 10% H2SO4 in EtOH. Column chromatography was carried out on Whatman\u2122 60\u2013120 mesh silica. Melting points were measured using an Electrothermal IA 9100 apparatus. IR spectra (KBr disc) were recorded on either a Pye Unicam Sp-3-300 or a Shimadzu FTIR 8101 PC infrared spectrophotometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on JEOL-JNM-LA 300 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) were reported in ppm and were referenced to tetramethylsilane as a standard (0.00 ppm). Chemical shifts for 13C NMR were referenced relative to DMSO (39.50 ppm). Elemental microanalysis was done on a Perkin Elmer 240 analyzer. Analyses indicated by the symbols of the elements were within \u00b10.4% of the theoretical values.",
