Most countries have responded to the pandemic with policies aimed at enforcing social distancing, a technique certain to suppress the transmission of the virus when it is applied uniformly to the whole population [10] . Whilst effective, social distancing measures come at a significant social and economic cost and may not be a feasible long-term policy option in many countries. In addition it has been noted that the approach may have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged groups in society [15] . As the effective reproduction rate (R t ) is reduced below 1.0, and the number of COVID-19 cases falls, there are clear benefits to governments reducing the scope of population-wide social distancing and seeking technologies that may alleviate the requirement for social distancing whilst also protecting healthcare services and maintaining human and civil rights. In particular, measures such as intensive testing, contact tracing and selective isolation have been proposed [5] .",

Assuming that strong correlates of protection to SARS-CoV-2 can be identified, immunity passports could provide a key technology in enabling the transition away from total lockdown. Chile has already announced plans to issue such passports [2] and key policy makers in the UK and Germany are also considering the approach [7] . In light of the interest already shown by several governments, and the emergence of a number of commercial solutions, an academic consideration of immunity passports is called for.",

Higher symbol numbers correspond to a greater number of modules, and more modules correspond to higher storage capacity. The maximum storage capacity for a standard QR code is 2953 bytes [28] .

In response to these concerns, we note that: (a) our paper-based solution is still contactless, as the paper certificate is scanned by the service provider; (b) the paper certificate is still digitally signed which negates the risk of forgery. In [8, 1, 4] blockchain is also used to provide antibody certificate solutions.

In digital contact tracing, users' phones continually broadcast ephemeral identities which are used to determine which users have come into contact and risked infection. Decentralised contact tracing systems [5] have the advantage of allowing users to compute which interactions may have risked infection locally, denying this information to a central authority. Analogously in our SecureABC scheme, users authenticate directly with service providers and the healthcare provider is denied certificate usage information.",
