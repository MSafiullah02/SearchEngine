The cumulative confirmed cases and death show nonlinear positive relationship with the value of asymptomatic rate. Based on this model, we analyze the inhibit effects to COVID-19 of three types of public health policies, i.e. isolation of laboratory confirmed cases, general personal protection and quarantine (lock-down). The simulations conclude that the isolation display limited effects to the asymptomatic viral carriers. The general personal protection and quarantine perform similar effects when the their percentages of participants are same. When the total proportion of asymptomatic, mild symptomatic and neglected patients is 40%, only depends on isolation policy may lead to an additional 75% infections, compared with general personal protection or quarantine with an efficiency 80%. At end, we provide seven recommendations of public health intervention before and during an aerial transmitted epidemic .",

At the beginning of the spread of this virus, there were already several experts point out this. Many researchers [1, 5, 9, 18, 25, 36, 38] prove the existence of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers by comparing the nucleic acid testing of patients' pharyngeal swab samples and chest CT scans with their typical symptoms and . Li et al. [28] mention that more young carriers show mild symptoms than older patients. Compared with retired people, young adult have more social activities in general. Include the asymptomatic carriers into an epidemic model is crucial. About the proportion of asymptomatic patients among all viral carrier, many experts [40, 33] provide their own estimation based on distinct data source.",

Then they also updated this model in [22, 23] . Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. [7] apply this model to analyze the spread of Measles. McCluskey [32] introduce the distributed delay and discrete delay into the SIR model. Some people update the model to a stochastic area [20, 21, 42] . To include exposed people with latency period, Dietz [13] construct SEIR model. Based on SEIR model, many experts update this model [4, 31] Many researchers use clinical and simulation data to calibrate the parameters in the epidemic model [4] . Various experts apply this type of model to analyze different diseases and develop it [14, 27, 35] . Ndii and Supriatna [34] claim that a deterministic model is more appropriate than stochastic models for an large initial susceptible population. More details of compartmental models in [6, 17] .",

We are interested in the effect of r to the epidemic is that, COVID-19 show much higher percentage of asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients. In our model, the infectious number I is only include the laboratory confirmed cases. Because the asymptomatic patients and people in incubation period can also infect susceptible people, we want to check the effect of the asymptomatic rate r to the spread of COVID-19. The research in this topic may explain the distinct performance of COVID-19 with other virus, i.e. SARS, MERS, and N1H1. Many experts provide their estimation of the asymptomatic rate r. Mizumoto et al. [33] studied the 3,063 tests on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship at Yokohama, Japan and got that the estimation of the asymptomatic proportion was 17.9%. Wu and McGoogan [40] the rate is only 1%. In face, finding a viral carrier without symptoms is really hard. Although, the clinical tools, such as testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab sample and chest CT scans, can help doctors, but the finding really depends on a local test capability, a personal opinion of infectious people and the incubation period of a virus. In general, when some patients ignore their mild symptoms at the beginning or a potential carrier cannot get tested immediately, the value from existing data is much underestimated. So in our paper, we analysis the effect of the spread of COVID-19 for the asymptomatic rate r between 0% and 60%.",

In our model, we assume all patients would have typical symptoms before they die, which is contradict to the real life.

However, the personal protections and quarantine are better than self-isolation of confirmed patients when we consider the asymptomatic infections for COVID-19 epidemic. Reviewing the intense condition of all countries involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, it is not reasonable to suppose patients can receive tests and treatments on time during a general broadly viral transmission. So, the asymptomatic viral population contains all mild symptomatic patients and infectious patients who cannot received laboratory test on time. Therefore, we conclude only self-isolating the laboratory confirmed case is worse than the other two, when regulators try to control the spread of one aerial viral epidemic. Then the general personal protection at beginning is better than a quarantine, although they show similar effects. For quarantine, even though all citizens support this policy, many people have to work and contact with others to maintain the function of our society, i.e. staff who are working at hospitals, groceries, post office, waste collection, public transportation, airports and so on. So in Figure 10 , we only compare the relative difference effects to the daily new cases from no action to 90% proportional execution.

Because isolation of confirmed cases is hard to control it, a general personal protection is one of the best method. In addition, this method is also better than lock down policy. Although these two methods share similar inhibit effects, personal protection lead to fewer disruptions to the society and economic. Public health agency need to involve general public into the fight with epidemic as soon as possible, in order to avoid having to implement quarantine province-wide or nationwide.",

In these three methods, the first two are much easier than the third one. Washing hand is the most useful and economical method to protect people. However, when the virus is transmitted by droplets or aerosols, only depends on washing hands could lead to dreadful result. In this case, social distancing is essential. Unfortunately, the social distance require critical condition about the location. In many place, such as the vehicle of most public transportation, school, and many workplace, no enough space exists to keep social distance. In this situation, general maskwearing is a good substitution. Tellier [37] recommend use N95 respirators as part of personal protective equipment for aerosol transmission. Considering the storage amount and price of N95, it should be saved to people work in high risk area. Li et al. [29] the efficiency of surgical masks is 95%, compared with 97% for N95. As a result, an optimal choice for general public is surgical mask during an outbreak. Because of the paucity of research about homemade face masks, we cannot give any conclusion about homemade face mask in this paper. Before cumulative cases and death increase sharply, the government need take action to produce or purchase enough surgical and N95 face masks for both health workers and general population, and educate people about the correct method to wear a face mask and protect themselves on the same time. During a aerial transmitted disease, a combination of all three types of personal protections is indispensable.",

But when a disease is out of control, it means the rule of isolation and general personal action are too late or too liberal.
