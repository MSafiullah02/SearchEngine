The changes are usually so small that the virus' antigenic properties remain the same and the immune system is able to recognize the pathogen (known as cross-protection). If these small changes accumulate, an antigenically different virus is produced to which the host has no immunity. The population is therefore able to catch flu more than once, and a new flu vaccine is produced each year according to the evolving viruses.",
