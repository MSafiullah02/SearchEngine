            "text": "Environmental scanning is defined as the employment of systematic methods by an organization to monitor and forecast those external forces and developments that are not under the direct control of the organization or its industry (Bates, 1985; Jain, 1984). It is also seen as consisting of the systematic procedures of searching, gathering and analyzing relevant information about changes, developments and relationships in an organization's external environment (Jennings and Jones, 1999). Zhao and Merna (1992, p. 7) refer to ES as \u2018a systematic process to collect information, interpret trends and events, and provide feasible courses of action\u2019. Overall, ES can be defined as an approach to gathering relevant information from the external environment and turning it into knowledge that can be widely used in managing hospitality organizations. Some studies, giving almost similar definitions, refer to ES as environmental analysis or issues analysis (Ansoff, 1980; Diffenbach, 1983; Engledow and Lenz, 1985; Murphy, 1989). However, environmental scanning seems to be the most widely used term.",

            "text": "Starting from the late 1960s, a substantial number of studies have been carried out in this area, and the literature on ES is still growing fast. However, previous studies into ES in the field of strategic management can be divided into two groups. The first sees ES as an important managerial activity and discusses its importance to organizations. These studies provide systematic guidelines and models to explain how ES can best be undertaken (see Aguilar, 1967; Ansoff, 1980; Bates, 1985; Diffenbach, 1983; Fahey and King, 1977; Hambrick, 1982; Jain, 1984; Miller and Friesen, 1983; Nanus, 1982; Stubbart, 1982; Thomas, 1980; Weihrich, 1982). The second group of studies raises criticisms of the applicability of the propositions raised in the first group. Included in the second group are studies carried out by Brownlie (1994), Engledow and Lenz (1985), Lenz and Engledow (1986a), Lenz and Engledow (1986b)), Mintzberg (1994) and Stubbart (1982). Stubbart (1982), for example, stated that \u2018Environmental scanning is one of those many ideas which look good on paper, but prove intractable in implementation.\u2019 (p. 144). These conflicting views on ES result from the fact that scholars of strategy come from different schools of thought. As discussed by Quinn (1980), Mintzberg (1994), Mintzberg et al. (1998), Okumus and Roper (1999), Pettigrew and Whipp (1991), Stacey (2000) and Whittington (1993) there are different approaches to strategic management such as the traditional planning, emergent, contingency, configurational, and complexity approaches, each of which has differing assumptions and propositions regarding ES, strategy formulation and implementation. Those studies advocating the introduction of formal ES procedures belong to the traditional planning approach; whereas other studies, critical of formal ES methods, fall under recent strategic management approaches, including the emergent, configurational and complexity approaches.",

However, these studies mainly make suggestions on formal ES procedures and rarely include any criticisms about the applicability of these practices in complex and dynamic situations. Given this, this paper aims to review the literature on ES and discuss potential challenges in employing a formal ES approach in hospitality organizations. It begins by reviewing the previous studies on ES, and then analyzes the assumptions and propositions found in the previous studies into ES.

In previous studies, the external environment is seen as being comprised of the relevant physical and social factors outside the boundary of an organization. It is grouped into the two broad categories of \u2018general environment\u2019 and \u2018task environment\u2019 (Costa and Teare, 1996; Costa et al., 1997; Olsen et al., 1998; West and Olsen, 1989). The general environment is referred to as the national and global context of political, economic, social, technological, legal and ecological conditions. The task environment is composed of suppliers, competitors, customers, regulators and other interest groups. ES is seen as an essential managerial tool and it is suggested that, through employing systematic scanning procedures, hospitality firms can identify opportunities and threats and then develop successful plans (Costa et al., 1997; Olsen et al., 1992; Zhao and Merna, 1992). It is further claimed that better and systemic ES could lead to improved economic performance. For example, in their empirical work West and Olsen (1988) found a high correlation between firm scanning behavior and performance in the food industry in the US. Several researchers have also found a positive relationship between environmental scanning, strategy and performance (Dev and Olsen, 1989; West, 1990).",

Irregular systems respond to a current crisis and their focus is on the solving of immediate problems. Periodic systems are more sophisticated and focus on longer-term problem solving. Finally, continuous systems focus on identifying opportunities rather than on problem solving. Organizations with such systems have a long-term horizon and allocate resources to activities in pursuit of these long-term goals. A formal continuous system of ES is recommended for hospitality firms (Costa and Teare, 1996; Olsen et al., 1994; West and Olsen, 1989). Regarding the scope of the scanning activities, two approaches are identified: the outside-in approach and the inside-out approach (Fahey and Narayanan, 1986). The first views the environment from a broad perspective. In this approach, all the existing elements in the outside environment are scanned and the longer-term trends, the development of alternative views and their implications are considered. The inside-out approach, on the other hand, takes a narrow view of the environment and concentrates upon only some elements in the outside environment. Concerning which approach hospitality organizations should adopt, Costa and Teare (1996) recommend that[T]o develop and implement an environmental scanning process that is relevant to the organization and has the potential to be successful, it has to be based on an inside-out perspective by selecting the areas of information need and the adequate sources to use.

In the above studies, three separate roles for ES units are identified. The first is policy-oriented, where an ES unit is ranked at the corporate level and given direct access to top management. The unit scans the relevant environment and informs the executives of major emerging trends and issues. The second role integrates environmental scanning and strategic planning. The ES unit can be either at corporate or divisional level, reporting to or operating as part of the planning department. Its purpose is both to motivate managers at the corporate and business levels and integrate issues in the planning process. The third role is a function-oriented one, in which the ES unit is part of a function at the corporate or business level aiming to improve future performance. Hospitality researchers appear to advocate the policy-oriented role for ES units and further suggest that scanning activities should be linked to long-term planning practices.",

They suggest that there should be clear rules and guidelines by which ES units identify events, trends and changes.

Finally, several key factors are identified in the successful adoption of a formal ES unit in hospitality firms (Costa et al., 1997; Olsen et al., 1992; Zhao and Merna, 1992). First, the top management of the hospitality firms should be committed to the activities of the unit. Second, the company should have an adaptive culture to welcome an ES unit, and have formal scanning practices. Third, ES should be linked to long-term planning if it is to be beneficial for the hospitality organization.",

Each of them has a different understanding and interpretation of the environment and how it should be viewed and scanned (Lenz and Engledow, 1986b). For example, according to the cognitive model, it is not the physical environment, but rather the enacted environment that exists in the collective \u2018cause maps\u2019 (perceptions) of hospitality managers. This makes it difficult for hospitality managers to draw a coherent concept of the external environment since each manager will have a different understanding of the company's external environment. Moreover, the literature on ES fails to provide sufficient guidelines for practitioners to analyze the external environment since, as stated by Lenz and Engledow (1986a), it is not always simple and easy for managers or ES units to isolate political, economical, social and technological factors. In addition, the ES literature is not very clear about how the general environment (political, economic, socio-cultural and technological conditions) can be linked or separated from the task environment (suppliers, competitors, customers, regulators and other interest groups). These areas are often interrelated and overlap with each other; a change in one area can easily have a dramatic impact on other areas, subsequently, on a hospitality firm. For example, a political problem in one region may have negative consequences for a country's economy; this, in turn, may lead to marked changes in socio-cultural behavior, particularly in the travel behavior of people. The difficulty is here to decide whether this change is a political, economic or socio-cultural issue related to the general environment, or a customer issue related to the task environment.",

For example, many hotels accommodate customers who either visit them very frequently or essentially use the hotels as long-term homes or offices. Customers may also buy a hotel company's shares in the stock market. One may find it difficult to decide whether these customers are internal or external to the hotel. Many hospitality organizations outsource some of their services, including laundry, restaurants, IT, security and staff dining. However, even if these services are outsourced, the contracting companies may operate within the hospitality organization. They may have direct contact with the hotel's employees and customers and, moreover, have an impact on the quality of the services offered by the hotel. Again, the question is whether these contracting firms should be seen as external or internal to the hotel company.",

The external environment has become less predictable due to wars, acts of terrorism, increased competition, rapid changes in customer attitudes, technological developments and radical changes in economies. Although these changes may mean that there is an increased need for environmental scanning, because of their complexity and low predictability, it is impossible to gain a comprehensive and reliable understanding of the external environment (Jennings and Jones, 1999). For instance, there are many examples of crises that were not predicted by experts, which then greatly affected the tourism and hospitality industries. Such examples include Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, beginning of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the September 11th terrorist attacks on America in 2001, the Bali bombing in 2002 and the recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in March 2003. From the point of view of hospitality companies, a good example is the Forte hotel group's failure to predict the takeover bid from Granada. For example, Rocco Forte and Teare (1991) explained Forte's overall strategy and long-term strategic plans with confidence, but his company was taken over by Granada in 1996. Reporting this takeover case, Teare et al. (1997, p. 9) revealed that \u2018At no time before 22 November 1995 did Forte think that it was about to be involved in a takeover bid.\u2019",

Based on these assumptions, he further stated that in 2003 occupancies would rise and the hospitality industry would have a better year than 2002. However, within the first couple of months of 2003, some of the above assumptions had already lost their validity with the terrorist attack on US citizens in Saudi Arabia in early 2003, the outbreak of a war with Iraq in March 2003, negative signals from the US economy and the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and China in March 2003. Diffenbach (1983) and Edgar and Nisbet (1996) note that the output of environmental scanning and strategic planning is either inaccurate or uncertain because managers often carry out ES with wrong assumptions, make false predictions and fail to properly characterize uncertainties in the external environment in understandable and meaningful terms. In short, supporting the complexity strategic management view, Edgar and Nisbet (1996) suggest that given the complex and dynamic nature of the external environment, hospitality organizations should not try to predict their environment but instead change their management approach, and develop competencies to quickly adapt their operations and services to the changing environment.",

Moreover, as Stubbart (1982) observed, even if managers have access to all sources of information, it is not often easy to decide what information is worth collecting and analyzing since information does not come prepackaged into clear opportunities or threats. It is often complex, vague and inaccurate, and requires further interpretation. The ability of hospitality managers to a gain comprehensive understanding of information is also limited through the bounded rationality (March and Simon, 1958). In addition, given the vast amount of information available particularly from the Internet and the media, separating the relevant environment from the irrelevant is undoubtedly a challenging task for many hospitality managers. In many cases, there are clashing reports and statistics on the same topic. The following quote from a hospitality journal illustrates the situation: \u2018Whether the [hospitality] industry is emerging from recession or still has a long way to go depends on whose statistics you read and analyze\u2019 (Anon, 2002, p. 12). The importance of data can also vary depending upon the backgrounds and experiences of managers. For example, a manager with a marketing background tends to identify issues related to the marketing and ignore issues related to other functional areas.",

As stated by Hill and Westbrook (1997) and Whittington (1993), in most cases there is no clear borderline between an opportunity and a threat. The Chinese appear to embrace this idea well. The symbol of their word for crises (or threat) called \u2018weiji\u2019 actually means both \u2018danger\u2019 and \u2018opportunity.\u2019 One person might regard a case of development and rapid change as a significant opportunity, while another might interpret it as a threat and respond to it in a very different way. In a survey (Olsen et al., 1995) assessing the ES activities of Chief Executive Officers of multinational hotel firms, the respondents indicated that economic growth, growth in tourism, technological innovations and environmental issues are the main opportunities for multinational hotel firms. One can perhaps argue that some of the opportunities identified in this study may also be seen as threats. For example, technological developments in information technology provide significant opportunities for hospitality firms to reach out to their customers and to set up efficient central reservation systems. On the other hand, because of these technological developments, many business people may no longer need to travel as often as they used to, as they can reach their clients through tele-conferencing, e-mail, etc. Second, hospitality companies need to invest in these newly developed technologies in order to maintain their competitive edge. This may mean more investment in IT, which hospitality firms, especially small ones, cannot always afford.",

This may be partly true in terms of occupancy rates and revenue figures. However, these crises may provide an opportunity to re-engineer hospitality organizations and to acquire new hotels due to low property prices. Take, for example, the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, which provided both opportunities and threats to the Turkish hospitality industry (Okumus and Cicek, 2002). The crisis was seen as an opportunity, since the Turkish lira lost over 40% of its value, making Turkey a cheaper tourist destination. As a result, Turkey experienced higher growth in inbound tourism compared to previous years. On the other hand, the financial crisis was seen as a threat, since the domestic travel market diminished in 2001 and operating costs in hospitality organizations rose. Another interesting example is the introduction of a single European currency, the euro. In terms of opportunities, tourists and hospitality organizations no longer have to shoulder commission charges and the expense arising from the discrepancy between buying and selling charges. There is now also greater price transparency, making price comparisons easier. In terms of threats, hospitality organizations needed to adjust their accounting reporting systems and train their staff. Exchange bureaus, travel agents and hotels lost some revenue from their foreign exchange transactions.",

            "text": "It is worth emphasizing that the perception of an issue as a threat or an opportunity may very much depend upon the type, size and ownership structure of the company as well as how its executives interpret and respond to developments in the external environment. On this point, Simons and Namasivayam (1999) state that issues in the external environment can have different implications on different types of hospitality organizations, or that these strategic issues can be interpreted differently by hospitality companies depending on their market segment, ownership structure and company size. A market trend may affect one group of customers but may have little effect on another group, and competition in one segment may have little impact on other segments. The ownership structure of hospitality companies can also affect the interpretation of external issues, since subsidiary companies, privately held companies and publicly traded companies face different capital environments. Simons and Namasivayam (1999) further note that a fall in the stock market might mean a threat for publicly traded company and an opportunity for a privately held company. Supporting these views, Taylor and Enz (2002) provide interesting empirical findings. According to their study, after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 in the US, high-priced hotel segments experienced a greater decline in business than hotels at lower price segments in the US. Highway hotels were found to be less affected by the events of September 11. After the terrorist attacks upscale hotels accelerated their renovation schedules. The hotels also took different approaches in trying to increase their business. For example, upscale hotels relied on marketing strategies to attract new customers while lower-priced hotels offered rate discounts.",

However, it is argued that neither the PEST analysis nor Porter's framework is always helpful in the precise identification of opportunities and threats (Hill and Westbrook, 1997; Mintzberg, 1994). Mainly supporting the emergent and the configurational strategic management views, the argument of these scholars of strategy is that the identification of opportunities and threats comes from studying existing practices, problems and gradual or radical changes in the external environment, rather than through a formal analytical process. For example, Honda's motorbike strategy in the US emerged by chance when some people showed an interest in the small motorbikes that were used by Honda's employees (Pascale, 1984). In the hospitality industry, there are many examples of companies that failed when entering new markets or introducing new products after undertaking serious formal environmental analyses. For example, Paris Disneyland (also known as Euro Disney) was opened in 1990 after serious analyses, business plans and projections pointed to the conclusion that it would be a great success. However, after its grand opening, major problems relating to the product and its marketing approach emerged. The company encountered serious operational and financial difficulties and eventually had to readjust its product, marketing and human resource management policies in Europe. Paris Disneyland now operates as one of the Europe's top destinations. More examples can also be given about how McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken started as small restaurants and eventually become national and global players through responding and overcoming emerging problems relating to their products and marketing approaches, and turning them into opportunities.",

However, it has been claimed that trying to adopt such a formal ES approach is not always helpful and practical, since the formalization of management activities often hinders and even kills creativity in organizations, particularly at the lower levels (Mintzberg, 1994; Stacey, 2000). Forming an ES unit and establishing standard ES activities in a hospitality organization mean that only this scanning unit will be responsible for these activities. As found by Engledow and Lenz (1985) and Stubbart (1982) doing this can create the impression that the suggestions and activities of other managers, particularly managers at lower levels, will no longer be needed or considered. In other words, formal ES activities carried out at the head office level may stop or discourage irregular and informal ES from being carried out at regional and operational levels. In addition, if ES activities are carried out by an ES unit at the head office level through formal and standardized methods, the unit may not be able to provide accurate and important information for the whole organization. For example, Calori et al. (2000) explained how Novotel's quality control system, which was also responsible for ES activities for the company, provided wrong signals about the organization's health; moreover, it inhibited local and individual initiatives. In order to rejuvenate Novotel, the company abolished the top-down quality control system and encouraged decentralized, bottom-up and informal ES activities that proved to be very beneficial for the company.",

            "text": "In terms of employing a top-down formal and inside-out ES approach in hospitality organizations, it is worth noting that many hospitality organizations are small establishments such as B&B, restaurants, bars and cafes, which are run as family businesses. The owners or managers of these establishments often do not have formal qualifications and experience in management; moreover, these small companies have limited financial resources and staff. Therefore, they do not (or cannot) usually employ formal and sophisticated management practices, including formal ES techniques. It has also been reported that even in larger hospitality organizations hotel managers prefer verbal communication and analysis (Wood, 1994; Mullins, 2001). Concerning utilizing the inside-out or the outside-in ES approach in hospitality organizations, the latter certainly takes into account a broader environment and therefore requires more time, resources and people. By contrast, the inside-out approach takes a narrow view, concentrates upon only some elements in the environment and therefore requires less time, resources and people. However, this approach may not be appropriate for hospitality organizations in a rapidly changing and complex environment since looking at only certain areas and factors in the external environment and ignoring the rest can be detrimental if hospitality organizations identify opportunities and threats and based on these develop and implement strategies.",

The problem with this is that, as stated above, the hospitality industry often faces unexpected crises, which force hospitality managers (and ES units if there are any) to drop everything and devote their time and resources to tackling these new problems, rather than spending them on devising long-term plans. Therefore, ES activities cannot be just for long-term planning, but should be linked to current operations and problems. Concerning this, Engledow and Lenz (1985) stated that ESmust engage the attention of current decision-makers and enter into current decisions. This requires careful blending of: line and staff participation, outside-in and inside-out perspectives; and present vs. prospective future strategies. This blending, in turn, requires an expert, politically savvy staff with strong top-level backing. (p. 102)\n",

            "text": "Previous studies in the hospitality industry have not provided empirical evidence on whether ES activities are used for problem solving or long-term planning in hospitality firms. However, a number of studies in strategic management have found that a very high majority of the firms they studied did not use ES results in their long-term planning activities, claiming that data gained from ES were not very helpful (Brownlie, 1994; Fahey et al., 1981; Lenz and Engledow, 1986a). For example, as noted earlier, the data and signals provided by the Novotel's ES system was not relevant and reliable and therefore in the process of undergoing a strategic organizational change the company decentralized ES activities, encouraged local initiatives and particularly focused on short-term problem-solving activities and this proved to be key in the company's strategic change process (Calori et al., 2000). There is another issue worth mentioning here related to the carrying out of ES activities solely for long-term strategic planning. It has repeatedly been reported in the generic strategic management field (Mintzberg, 1994; Lorange, 1998; Pettigrew and Whipp, 1991; Whittington, 1993) that many organizations abandoned their strategic planning units and activities. Again, there is still limited knowledge in the hospitality literature on how far strategic planning is being undertaken by hospitality organizations. Considering the limited use of sophisticated management methods in hospitality organizations, one may question how ES activities can be linked to non-existent planning practices in hospitality organizations.",

They explain how Accor's Formula 1 hotel chain achieved success and better economic performance by implementing a different approach to hotel management. Rather than following the conventional management approach suggested by the traditional planning view in the strategy field, Accor questioned the fundamental assumptions of managing hotels, introduced new concepts and achieved value innovation.

The emerging question here is whether harmony can be achieved between formal ES practices and the culture of a hospitality organization. Considering the different types and sizes of business in the hospitality sector, it may be difficult to come to any kind of conclusion. However, the following observations can be made. Although there are some large multinational firms in the hospitality industry, as stated earlier small and owner-managed firms dominate, and these firms are often lacking in professional management skills, experience and resources. Behind their formal organizational structure, most hospitality firms have an informal and organic structure, characterized by a reliance on informal verbal and lateral communication (Wood (1994), Wood (1997)). In addition, the hospitality industry employs large numbers of individualistic people who prefer to employ a \u2018hands on\u2019 management style and who enjoy having close contact with clients and employees rather than following methods of structured formal analysis. Tourism and hospitality organizations have long relied on the entrepreneurial traits of initiative and intuition. Methodological management and decision-making approaches are not often applied in hospitality organizations (Reichel and Preble, 1984). The above characteristics of the industry provide very little support for the applicability of rational and formal ES activities in hospitality organizations. Some previous studies provided findings supporting this claim. For example, West and Olsen (1989) stated that \u2018most executives utilize a rather informal approach to the environmental scanning process. They also heavily rely upon other members of management or other executives for their information\u2019 (p. 290). Costa and Teare (1996) stated that \u2018environmental scanning is not in widespread use among hospitality organizations\u2019 (p. 15), while Olsen et al. (1998) noted that hospitality managers are not very much committed to formal and continuous types of ES activities. In a recent study by Jogaratnam and Law (2003), hospitality managers in Hong Kong were found to rely on customers, WWW and business associates for ES activities.",

            "text": "It is stated that ES should be a separate function from \u2018strategic planning,\u2019 and that hospitality firms should therefore form freestanding ES units at their head offices reporting directly to CEOs (Costa and Teare, 1996; West and Olsen, 1989; Zhao and Merna, 1992). However, empirical studies in the field of strategic management reveal that freestanding ES units face serious difficulties and do not survive (Engledow and Lenz, 1985). A number of reasons can be given why ES units cannot survive in hospitality organizations. First, as stated above, the majority of businesses in the hospitality industry are small establishments, which have limited resources and knowledge for establishing ES units or for recruiting someone especially for the task of ES. Second, the majority of hospitality organizations do not have an organizational culture that allows for the employment of professional management approaches, including formal ES activities. Third, due to organizational politics and differing perceptions at various management levels, other departments and lower management levels may not always believe in the importance of ES units and their activities (Engledow and Lenz, 1985). A further reason is that ES units do not always provide any visible output such as profits and, therefore, are seen as cost centers in the long term. For example, Stubbart (1982) found that when there are performance problems or changes in top management and ownership, companies often introduce radical structural changes and cut costs initiatives and under these circumstances ES units are seen as vulnerable targets. Such examples can also be seen in the hospitality industry. For example, it is well known that for the last ten years a large majority of hotel groups have acquired other hotel chains or have been acquired by other companies. As in the case of Forte it has been the general practice of takeover companies to replace top management teams and make structural changes to cut costs and run hotels more efficiently than before. A final reason for why ES units cannot survive is that many hospitality organizations can use external consultants or buy essential information from organizations offering a variety of external reports, forecasts, and other services, rather than produce this information within their own organizations.",

            "text": "This paper has reviewed the literature on ES in the field of strategic hospitality management and discussed the potential challenges and problems of employing a formal ES approach in hospitality organizations. A number of conclusions emerge from the above discussion. First, previous studies in hospitality management apply ES concepts and frameworks to the hospitality management field from the normative traditional planning approach in the strategic management field without seriously questioning whether they would be relevant and practical in hospitality firms. As discussed above, hospitality organizations would face major challenges and deterrents when following such a formal approach to ES. Second, this paper does not suggest that ES in hospitality organizations is unnecessary or unimportant. In fact, it argues that ES is crucial for every hospitality organization, but that the ES function is more complex and difficult to accomplish than most previous studies in our field might lead a reader to believe. Third, it is suggested in this paper that hospitality organizations should not form ES units (or recruit some especially for this task) and undertake formal ES activities before critically evaluating the potential cultural and political problems and implications. The argument here is that effective ES depends on the interpretation and experience of managers and employees from all levels in hospitality organizations. Rather than having several people solely responsible for ES and strategic planning, everybody in a hospitality organization should be responsible for ES and try to continuously identify and evaluate the patterns emerging within and outside the company. They should not only consider the implications of these developments for a specific part of the company but also for other functional areas and for the customers, competitors, suppliers and the public organizations. However, this requires that hospitality organizations establish a network organizational structure and train their managers at all management levels about advance strategic management schools of thought, particularly the emergent, configurational and complexity views.",

            "text": "Finally, more research is certainly needed into ES in the tourism and hospitality management field. This is because, despite the substantial number of previous research studies, there is still a limited empirical evidence on how many leading hospitality organizations have free-standing ES units, how these organizations carry out their ES activities, and their implications on the development of strategy and financial performance. In addition, more research is also needed to investigate how all levels of hospitality organizations can best engage in ES activities. Future studies can also provide empirical evidence about potential challenges and difficulties in employing formal ES procedures in hospitality organizations. Previous empirical studies into ES in the hospitality management field have generally collected data via surveys. It is believed that following a longitudinal research strategy and employing hands-on qualitative research methods could lead to a deeper and better understanding of ES issues in hospitality organizations.",
