            "text": "Avian reovirus (ARV) causing arthritis, chronic respiratory diseases, and malabsorption syndrome leads to considerable economic losses (Kibenege and Wilcox, 1983). ARV-encoded proteins, including at least 10 structural proteins and 4 non-structural proteins have been demonstrated (Varela and Benavente, 1994, Bodelon et al., 2001). In the \u03c3-class proteins of ARV, protein \u03c3C, is a minor outer-capsid protein of ARV that is encoded by the largest open reading frame of the S1 segment (Varela and Benavente, 1994, Bodelon et al., 2001). It is not only an attachment protein (Martinez-Costas et al., 1997) but also an apoptosis inducer (Shih et al., 2004). Some studies have suggested that \u03c3C is the target for type-specific neutralizing antibodies while \u03c3B is target for group-specific antibodies (Wickramasinghe et al., 1993). Protein P10 is a viroporin (Bodelon et al., 2002) responsible for ARV-induced cell fusion (Bodelon et al., 2001). A recent report suggests that P17 retards cell growth by activation of P53 pathway (Liu et al., 2005). ARV \u03c3A, encoded by the genome segment S2 (Yin et al., 2000), has been identified as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein (Yin et al., 2000) and is an inhibitor of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinas (Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2003). Another ARV protein, \u03c3NS, encoded by the genome segment S4 (Chiu and Lee, 1997), has been reported for its single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding activity (Yin and Lee, 1998).",

Using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to inhibit the cellular proteasome pathway, it was found that MG132 could reduce ARV-induced apoptosis, cytopathic effect (CPE), virus titer, and protein expression. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did not affect viral entry and host cell translation. To our knowledge, this is the first finding demonstrating that ARV replication and ARV-induced apoptosis could be suppressed by MG132.",

ARV replication in untreated cells resulted in the generation of a viral titer of 107.5\n PFU/ml after 18 h.p.i., wherease proteasome inhibition reduced the viral titer in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The results indicated that the proteasome inhibitor significantly blocked ARV production, suggesting that the proteasome may play an important role in ARV replication. In this study, viral titers in the whole cell lysates harvested at 18 h.p.i. were reduced dramatically by MG132 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the effect is due to the reduction in virus growth rather than to a delay in virus release. Different amounts of input virus change the absolute amount of progeny virus but do not affect significantly the percentage of reduction in viral titers, suggesting that the antiviral properties of MG132 are independent of the multiplicity of infection (Fig. 1B). In addition, ARV-induced CPE is characterized by cell fusion, detachment of infected cells from culture flask, cell lysis and death. ARV-induced CPE and cell death were reduced dramatically after the addition of MG132 (Fig. 1C).",

It is involved in a wide variety of mediated proteolytically intracellular process, such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, transcriptional control, and metabolic regulation (Hilt and Wolf, 2000). Studies by many research groups have shown that various viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to use or manipulate the host ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for their own needs. Retroviruses require the proteasome for budding from cells (Schuber et al., 2000), murine coronavirus for its transfer from endosome to cytoplasm during viral entry (Yu and Lai, 2005), minute virus of virus (MVM) and reovirus for nuclear translocation (Connolly et al., 2000, Ros and Kempf, 2004), and human cytomegalovirus for inducing cell cycle progression (Kalejta et al., 2003). Adenovirus requires active proteasomes to promote late gene expression (Galinier et al., 2002), Coxsackievirus for viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis (Luo et al., 2003), and tobacco mosaic virus for degradation movement protein (Reichel and Beachy, 2000). To date, whether the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-mediated ARV replication and apoptosis induction is related to ubinquintin process or the proteasome degradation remains largely unknown. This study was therefore aimed at elucidating whether ARV also uses the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for it's own benefit and other mechanisms for cell regulation. In this study, various aspects of the ARV-proteasome interplay were characterized. A proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to explore the effect of proteasome inhibition on ARV replication and apoptosis induction by ARV. It was observed that MG132 was fully active against ARV when present at the beginning of the infection and a very limited effect was observed when present later after infection, suggesting that inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system did not affect virus entry and internalization and blocked ARV replication at an early step in viral life cycle.",

During the past several years, it was demonstrated that ARV \u03c3C could induce apoptosis in both culture cells and chicken tissues (Shih et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2007). Studies by our laboratory have demonstrated further that ARV-induced apoptosis by linking Src kinase to p53-mitochondrial pathway (Lin et al., 2006, Chulu et al., 2007). A recent report demonstrated that p53 regulates bax expression and translocation into the mitochondria leading to cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, activating the caspase pathway that finally leads to cell apoptosis (Chulu et al., 2007). To date, the levels of ARV RNA transcription and protein synthesis in infected cells in the presence of MG132 were not clear. In the present study, the ARV RNA transcription and protein synthesis were shown to be inhibited dramatically in the ARV-infected cells after treatment with MG132. The expression of ser46-phosphorylated p53 and active caspase 3 in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells was reduced markedly following treatment with MG132. This suggested that MG132 decreased ARV infectivity and possessed the anti-apoptotic effect that may be due to reduced viral replication, especially down-regulation of \u03c3C expression (Fig. 3B\u2013C).",

Perhaps the ubiquitination of viral proteins is required for ubiquitin-proteasome mediated viral replication, such as ssRNA- and dsRNA-binding proteins \u03c3NS and \u03c3A which are essential for ARV replication. Elucidation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways involved in avian reovirus replication and induction of apoptosis will contribute important new information leading to better understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses in general cause cell death and diseases. Further study is undergoing to address these questions.",
