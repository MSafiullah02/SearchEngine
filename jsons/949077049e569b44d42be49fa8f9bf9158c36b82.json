Thus alcohol based sanitiziers may 53 promote hand hygiene adherence and should be utilized more frequently by healthcare workers, 54 except when hands are visibly soiled.",

            "text": "editor: Cavanagh and Wambier have written an informative article on how dermatologists 30 may approach hand hygiene during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 1 They 31 describe the risk of hand dermatitis in healthcare workers faced with a sudden increase in 32 frequency of hand washing. They appropriately recommend measures to decrease this risk such 33 as applying hypoallergenic moisturizers and not rinsing with hot water. The authors also state 34 that skin damage caused by hand washing provides a route of entry for SARS-CoV-2. They note 35 that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor which SARS-CoV-2 binds to, is 36 present in capillaries of the skin, the basal layer of the epidermis, and eccrine glands. 37 Although hand dermatitis is common amongst healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, 38 we disagree that hand fissures provide SARS-CoV-2 with a route of entry. SARS-COV-2 39 spreads primarily by respiratory droplets and there is no literature to suggest that it is a 40 bloodborne pathogen capable of infecting through cuts or open wounds. It is true that the viral 41 spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors to initiate viral entry. However, the 42 cofactor transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is also necessary for S protein priming 43 (i.e., cleavage by a host cell protease). 2 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been shown to be highly co-44 expressed in a type of bronchial progenitor cell, which represents a more probable target for 45 SARS-COV-2 infection than open wounds. 3 46 alternate reasons, namely increasing hand hygiene compliance.
