            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family and includes a number of viruses that cause the common cold (eg, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1). 1 SARS-CoV-2 is also related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which cause severe disease that is associated with high mortality rates. 2, 3 Coronaviruses originate in bats but are zoonotic and can circulate in a number of mammals and birds. 1 SARS-CoV emerged into the human population because of the exotic food trade in China, which allowed for a transmission event between a civet cat and a human. 4 MERS-CoV has emerged into the human population because of the use of camels as livestock, which has allowed for multiple transmission events between camels and humans. 5 The intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. 2, 3 In this study, I mined the NCBI expressed sequence tag (est) database to discover sequences related to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-like virus sequences that were highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 were identified in two separate complementary DNA (cDNA) pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) head kidney tissue. 6, 7 The sequence from C. auratus cDNA was 152 amino acids long and the sequence from C. idealla cDNA was 88 amino acids long. BLAST analysis suggests that these sequences belong to SARS-like coronaviruses, and that they are not evolutionarily conserved in other species.",

It is important to highlight the limitation of this study, which relies solely on a bioinformatics pipeline, which may be flawed. However, these data raise the possibility that SARS-like coronaviruses are a common environmental pathogen in the region. Further research is required to test cell lines and the aquatic environment in and around the epicenter of the epidemic for SARS-like coronaviruses. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing was performed previously by Zhong et al 6 and Adams et al 7 and uploaded to Gen-Bank on the expressed sequence tag (est) database.",

The Institute of Hydrobiology is pinned and a distance measurement to the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market is shown These data reveal two SARS-like coronavirus sequences in separate cDNA pools of carp cells and tissue that originated from two separate laboratories at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Wuhan, China. Both cDNA samples were submitted many years ago. It is unclear how these sequences relate to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, and it is possible that these sequences are artifacts and do not represent coronavirus contamination of the cDNA samples. cDNA samples can often harbor contaminating nucleic acid from the surrounding environment and can be a source to search for environmental DNA. In the case of the C. auratus, cDNA was produced from a cell line that was established in 1985. It is possible that this cell line contains an adventitious agent that is related to SARS-CoV-2. C. idella cDNA was produced from head kidney tissue from a live fish. This suggests that some carp species may be permissive to coronavirus infection. It is unclear how the identified sequences relate to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, although the identification of these sequences in the cells and tissues of animals in the proximity of the outbreak epicenter suggests that environmental surveillance should focus on adventitious agents in cell culture and the nearby aquatic environment.",
