Each eligible patient was prospectively enrolled and participated in a structured interview as part of their routine initial medical evaluation. As part of an on-going Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis, all positive isolates obtained from persons residing in Tarrant County are sent to the Texas Department of Health (TDH) for DNA fingerprinting. All patients are interviewed at the time of the initial evaluation, using a data collection instrument designed to obtain demographic information and medical history. The results of the DNA fingerprinting were incorporated into the database using patient identification numbers. Epidemiological factors included in this study were age, country of birth, date of entry, race/ethnicity, onset of symptoms, date of diagnosis and physical address. Any patient who did not have both PCR-based spoligotyping and RFLP-based IS6110 analysis performed on their corresponding MTB isolate, and/or did not live within Tarrant County at the time of collection were excluded from the geographical analysis.",

Since the discriminatory power of the IS6110 probe is poor for strain differentiation among specimens with five or fewer of the insertion elements, additional genotyping using the PCR-based spoligotyping was utilized (Kamerbeek, et al., 1997) .

We seek to understand how location within a homeless shelter influences risk of tuberculosis infection. The data set comprises screening records for each case including age, race, date tested, status of tuberculosis, location in the facility, length of time spent in the facility, and other variables. Within the Shelter the 800 beds can be assigned to major areas -Men's Mats, Men's Beds, Men Over 50, Female Mats and Females Over 50 Beds. Each of these areas varied in bed density, floor space and occupants (Figure 1) . The Mats area, (both male and female), is occupied by transients with no regular source of food, shelter, or shower. The Beds and Over 50 areas (male and female) are less dense overall, with more permanent residents. Results of initial analysis suggest that TB risk is not uniformly distributed but depends on the location of the sleeping bed and duration and frequency of stay at the night shelter. For example, 12 of the 17 active cases (63.2%) had been visiting the shelter for more than 5 years. We need to examine certain dynamics of the Homeless Shelter that promotes or inhibit TB transmission such as the air circulation system. For example, while the men's and women's areas had different airflow systems, it appeared that air flow in the women's section was more effective than in the men's section. Is this a factor in TB transmission? The movement patterns of residents also need to be addressed. How much time do they spend in common areas such as the dining area, the smoking area, the TV area and rest rooms? Another factor to consider is the lighting in different parts of the Homeless Shelter. Does the heat put off by the lighting affect dispersion of the bacilli?",
