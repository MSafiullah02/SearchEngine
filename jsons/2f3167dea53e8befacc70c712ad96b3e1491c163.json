Sputum samples, and bronchial brushings and washings yield diagnostic material for centrally located lesions that involve major airways, while a BAL is useful for assessing inflammatory and infectious processes in the peripheral regions of the lung. Transbronchial or ultrasound guided FNA permits endobronchial lesions or hilar lymph nodes to be sampled, and radiologically guided FNA is used when subpleural regions need to be aspirated that cannot be assessed by bronchoscopy. Given that cytologic examination of the respiratory tract is less invasive compared to open surgical biopsies, cytology is often the initial and only means by which patients are evaluated for infectious diseases. This is especially true in immunocompromised patients who need to be followed over a given period of time to rule out opportunistic infections. In fact, BAL remains the diagnostic procedure of choice for detecting opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts.",
