At d 8 prior to his hospitalization (Apr. 13, 2014) , he began to experience aversion to cold, fever (body temperature not reported), systemic soreness and runny nose. He then paid a visit in a local clinic and received oral intake of Chinese patent medicine for cold. However, his condition showed no obvious improvement. On Apr. 18, 2014, his symptoms obviously aggravated, with cough, aversion to cold, fever, systemic soreness, headache and accompanying poor appetite and malaise. After treatment by Compound Amionpyrine Antipyrine Injection and dexamethasone, his condition still showed no improvement. On Apr. 19, 2014, he began to experience abdominal upset, dyspnea, shortness of breath after physical activities, and expectoration of a little bloody sputum. On the following day, chest X-ray showed large consolidation in the left lung and nodular patches of opacity in the right upper lung. By the test of CDC in Nanyun, Sichuan province on Apr. 21, 2014, the nucleic acid of H5N6 avian infl uenza was shown positive. And death fi nally occurred on Apr. 22, 2014 after emergency rescuing procedures. By physical examination on admission, the body temperature was 37.3 \u00b0C, heart rate 96/min, breathing rate 30/min and blood pressure 106/74 mmHg. He showed complexion of acute disease, good consciousness, and poor spirits. By percussion, dull sound of the left lung and a little sporadic fi ne moist rales; while clear breathing sound of the right lung and no dry or moist rales. No other positive signs found. The patient was a farmer who had raised and saled poultries (including chickens and ducks) for a long time. He reported recent deaths of his poultries and a history of cooking and eating them. By routine blood test, WBC count 1.48 \u00d7 10 9 /L, GR% 82.4 %, and LY% 12.8 %. By arterial blood glass analysis, PO 2 55.0 mmHg, PCO 2 34.0 mmHg, SaO 2 91.0 %; CRP 252.00 mg/L, PCT 3.600 ng/ml. By blood biochemistry, AST 84.4U/L, and Cr 70.8 \u03bcmol/L. On May 6, 2014, the tests by the National CDC of China further proved the diagnosis of human infected H5N6 avian infl uenza.",

In this fi rst case of pneumonia induced by H5N6 avian infl uenza virus worldwide, due to our limited knowledge about radiological signs of the disease, its differential diagnosis from pneumonia induced by H7N9, H5N1, H5N6 avian infl uenza viruses and other type A infl uenza viruses is challenging. And the diagnosis was defi ned based mainly on the epidemiological history and etiological examination. [ Brief Medical History ] A 59-year-old man was hospitalized due to fever for 14 days and shortness of breath for 9 days. Fourteen days prior to his hospitalization, he began to experience fever with his body temperatures fl uctuating between 39 and 40 \u00b0C and aversion to cold. After oral intake of Compound Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride tablets by himself, his condition failed to be improved. He experienced no cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, chest distress and pain. Eight days prior to his hospitalization (d 6 after onset), his condition aggravated and he paid his clinic visit in a local hospital. He was preliminarily diagnosed with bacterial infection and given anti-infection therapy (details not known), with poor therapeutic effi cacy. Chest X-ray in the local hospital showed multiple infections in both lungs. Routine blood test showed WBC count 6.6 \u00d7 10 9 /L, GR% 91.6 % and LY% 15.6 %; PCT 1.21 ng/ml. Tablets of Ceftazidime and Moxifl oxacin Hydrochloride were prescribed to fi ght against infections, and non-invasive mechanical ventilation was ordered. Six days prior to his hospitalization (d 8 after onset), the patient showed aggravation of shortness of breath, with SPO 2 level of 50-70 %. Assisted ventilation via tracheal intubation was then ordered. Meanwhile, throat swab showed nucleic acid of H5 subtype of avian infl uenza virus positive, fungi positive (++++) in feces, and fungi positive in phlegm, which indicated highly pathogenic human infected avian infl uenza and severe pneumonia. Medications of Imipenem, Oseltamivir and Ethylprednisolone Sodium Succinate were prescribed, but showing poor therapeutic effi cacy. The patient had a medical history of colon cancer 1 year ago, which was treated by sigmoidectomy in another hospital with following 4 sessions of chemotherapy. Reexamination 2 months ago in that hospital indicated no relapse of cancer. More than 30 years ago, the patient had a medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis, which was cured. By physical examination, the body temperature 36.6 \u00b0C and SpO 2 95 %; assisted ventilation via tracheal intubation; weakened fremitus vocalis by palpation; dullness of both lungs by percussion; weak breathing sounds of both lungs and moist rales of both lower lungs by auscultation. He reported a history of buying a living poultry in a market that provided slaughtering service.",

These radiological fi ndings are in consistency with literature reports about pneumonia induced by avian infl uenza virus. On d 14 after onset, CT scan showed pleural effusion in a small quantity, which rarely occurs in the cases of SARS and other avian infl uenza virus pneumonia. Meanwhile, by deep phlegm culture, acinetobacter baumannii was positive, which may be the reason for pleural effusion.
