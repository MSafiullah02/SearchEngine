Studies from the U.S. have found that 19% of patients testing positive for COVID-19 were hospitalized and 6% were admitted to an intensive care unit.3 The most recent CDC estimates of the mortality rate in the United States show that the rate is similar to China, ranging from 0.9% overall with an increased mortality rate in patients with comorbid medical conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancer.8\n",

Each of the four patients developed AMS without fever or respiratory symptoms and were transferred to the local emergency department and were tested for the COVID-19 virus as part of their medical work up. All four patients tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and met the inclusion criteria for this report: AMS without fever or respiratory symptoms and positive COVID-19 test.

All four patients had common risk factors for developing a COVID-19 infection: communal living, older age and multiple comorbid medical problems. None of the patients had the classic presentation of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.  All four patients were sent to the emergency department (ED) within 24-48 hours of developing AMS. In the ED, all the patients were tested for COVID-19 using the molecular diagnosis/polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing. The test was positive for all four patients within 3-7 days. Chest x-rays were positive for pneumonia in all four patients.  All of the patients were hospitalized. Two patients were admitted to hospice and are currently in grave condition.
