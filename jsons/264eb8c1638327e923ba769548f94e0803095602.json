The biocontainment unit was established in the aftermath of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and avian influenza A in the early 2000s, getting its first use in the 2014-2016 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic. The unit has critical care capabilities. The quarantine unit has airborne precaution capabilities but was designed to accommodate groups of individuals who are not ill, a need suggested by returned healthcare workers following occupational exposures in the West African epidemic.

Nonetheless, they were constrained by schedule, location, and physical and human barriers until their departure from quarantine.

Federal quarantine orders-the first such use in over 50 yearspresented contextual challenges. In general, U.S. quarantine stations exist at major points of entry, such as at large international airports, where small numbers of sentinel cases of an emerging disease are thought to be most likely to be first encountered in the United States. 3 In late 2019, UNMC/NM opened the first national quarantine unit. This twenty-bed unit is designed to host larger numbers of quarantined persons than existing, smaller quarantine stations. It is colocated with a national training resource for public health emergency personnel, in close proximity to the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, to enable more advanced care if needed. 4 This large group of 57 persons, however, were managed by federal authorities at Camp Ashland-a Nebraska Army National Guard base outside of Omaha-with some logistics support from UNMC/NM. By the time that the quarantined persons from Wuhan arrived, experts had already considered the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might shed before symptoms, facilitating its ability to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission. 5 For this reason, UNMC/NM initially sought to test asymptomatic individuals to inform their case management and how they were housed. However, a consensus regarding the advisability of testing could not be reached with authorities because of concerns regarding their personal autonomy (whether the quarantined persons understood the implications of testing and could make a choice freely) and uncertainty about what to do about isolated negative test results. Testing was not pursued. In the end, none of the quarantined evacuees from Wuhan demonstrated clinical evidence of COVID-19. 6 The question of scope of presymptomatic shedding remained unanswered.",

By that time, Asia had accumulated many cases, and a literature base was developing. 8, 9 Nonetheless, cases in the United States remained few, and availability of information and specimens from affected areas in Asia that were relevant to medical countermeasure development was limited. This prompted UNMC/NM to launch its own research initiative for the prospective assessment of patients.

Fielded questions were sometimes narrow and sometimes broad. They often highlighted uncertainty about the disease itself, which limited the ability to make evidence-based decisions. This process facilitated stakeholders coming together to start pursuing answers (Box 2). The committee also undertook a survey of research associated with the response and started to link risk management challenges with sources of information that might assist decision-making. Several needs were evident as research planning discussions ensued (Box 3). Importantly, these discussions led to a broad picture of how a platform for research might be applied, and a prospective, observational cohort study design was selected.",

Consequently, the primary pool of investigators BOX 1 A revised quarantine law's first use On January 31, 2020, the CDC issued a federal mandatory quarantine order for 195 Americans evacuated out of Wuhan, China, on January 29. 18 Effective February 2, Health and Human Services declared a mandatory quarantine for any U.S. citizens or permanent residents returning to the United States who had returned from the Hubei Province of China in the previous 14 days. In addition, all U.S. citizens and permanent residents returning from mainland China were required to undergo two weeks of self-monitoring. This marked the first time in over 50 years that mandatory federal quarantine had been invoked under the CDC's jurisdiction. By contrast, federal isolation orders have been comparatively common. Isolation differs from quarantine in that isolation requires infection with a quarantinable, communicable disease, not just exposure. Between 2005 and 2016, the CDC issued 12 federal isolation orders, 19 relying mainly on port-of-entry screening. Historically, state and local health departments have executed most quarantine orders. In 2019, to decrease the spread of measles in California, Los Angeles County did so for more than 200 individuals at two college campuses. 20 The quarantine measure met little resistance. Other state orders have not been so well received. In 2014, New Jersey issued a quarantine order for a nurse returning to the United States after caring for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. Afterward, the nurse filed suit in federal court, stating that New Jersey had violated her constitutional rights to liberty and due process. She later dropped her suit, settling in favor of changes to the state's quarantine regulations, including provisions for the right to counsel, notice of hearings, visitor rights, and the right to privacy. 21 The case suggests where some points of friction may arise as the CDC continues its COVID-19 orders. Coronavirus Disease-19 quarantines also were the first to test recently updated regulations. In 1967, quarantine authority shifted to the CDC for cases involving ports of entry, with interstate quarantine added to the CDC's jurisdiction in 2000. Related regulations have had several updates, most recently in 2017, with a stated focus on individuals' due process rights. Some anticipated issues include mandatory reassessment of quarantine cases, social distancing practices, compensation for lost wages, and payment for the care and treatment of quarantined individuals. Under the current regulations, any federal isolation or quarantine order must be reassessed within 72 hours of issuance of the order, seemingly impractical in light of large numbers of related cases, if conducted individually. It may be impossible to house each person alone, despite the consequences for housemates if the person is infected. In addition, regulations do not expressly direct payment for the care and treatment of individuals subject to a federal quarantine. These costs may include diagnostic testing. The regulations allow that the director of the CDC may authorize payment for such care and treatment, but that payment is in the CDC's sole discretion. This language leaves matters of payment open to interpretation and negotiation, which may be a hindrance to real-time decision-making. Many of these issues relate to differences between small-scale quarantines and the additional challenge of larger scale events, as relevant for COVID-19. As this health emergency evolves, ambiguous guidelines, combined with the unprecedented nature and scale of this quarantine, could impact the operational response. The CDC is in a unique situation to take precedent-setting action, establishing new standards for how federal quarantine should occur in the United States for many years to come. needed at the bedside and in the laboratory are readily able to undertake practices and follow procedures within containment areas, including Institutional Biosafety Committeeappropriate laboratory spaces. Consequently, when an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic occurs, the work is feasible.",

This allowed decision-makers and implementers alike a space in which to air concerns based on unanswered questions or perceived operational or organizational risks. The committee was advisory in nature. One such question asked how best to prioritize N95 respirators that were anticipated to be in short supply. The conversation revolved around fit-testing requirements. At a center like UNMC/NM, several hundred respirators are consumed each year in quantitative fit testing for staff who have newly arrived, or for required periodic testing. Logistical, ethical, legal, and operational considerations included finding the right balance between the need for appropriate fit-especially if at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, differences in regulatory intent for fit testing and a more rigorous standard applied by the university, and preconceived notions of need, practice, and requirements. Several small program adjustments were thought to have promise. These were reevaluating nondestructive or qualitative fit testing, using a survey to enable a longer interval before retesting, and prioritizing new employees and areas with higher risk for encounters with ill patients. Important research avenues emerged, and this process highlighted the need for interdisciplinary approaches. Environmental hygiene, logistics, and implementation science aims all arose from the conversation in ways that might not otherwise have emerged. Decision-related knowledge needs relevant to the prospective, observational cohort study described in this article have included viral shedding dynamics, clinical course relevant to resource demand, and the horizon of available medical countermeasures and their development.",
