Considering that the consequences of social media as a major source of influence grows, extant inquiry to explore who takes the lead in information sharing, and more importantly the patterns of information exchange among these users become more prevalent. Therefore, the data from online social networks affords fresh opportunities and views regarding the creation and influence of large-scale social networks and communities and the evaluation of these networks. In recent times, social networks have evolved into influential platforms of human communication, conducting business, information sharing and various countenances of normal facets of life [33].",

Firstly, this study use social network theory, but adds a graph theoretical lens, a lesser used theory to enrich the existing body of knowledge. Secondly, it adds to the existing group of studies which focuses on social media research during an important event \u2013 in this case, the emergence of a new idea (the South African National Health Insurance Bill hand-over to parliament - #NHI). The third contribution, is that it considers both the network topology and the behavior of network actors in the comprehensive #NHI networked system. This study therefore not only considers the predominant behavioural examination of social data, but it enables the use of the combined knowledge of network structure and behaviour which is substantially distinct from the \u201cstraight-forward analysis\u201d of single limited graphs [11, 12]. The fundamental research objectives in this study can be listed as:To model the emergence of a new idea (i.e. the South African National Health Insurance Bill announcement in parliament - #NHI), based on Twitter users and their interactions on Twitter.To determine the key influential actors in Twitter as social network in the #NHI conversation.To describe the degree distributions of the relationships between Twitter users in the #NHI Twitter conversation.",

Similarly, information systems are developing beyond organisational boundaries, to come to be a part of the larger societal context, necessitating strategic information system research to explore the competitive setting of dynamic social systems. Literature on social media over the past years abounds, whereas an agreed definition of the concept, is less clarified [37]. In this study, social media is defined as a collection of user-defined platforms which allows for information interactivity and diffusion between users of open platforms which enables them to expand social relationships with their social networks [2, 9, 10, 34, 37]. Social media literature is synthesised into twelve clusters. These clusters are as follows [37]: (1) Social media usage, behaviours and consequences; (2) Reviews and recommendations on social media platforms; (3) Organisational impact of social media; (4) Social media for marketing; (5) Participation in social media communities; (6) Social media risks; (7) Stigmatisation of social media usage behaviour; (8) Value creation through social media; (9) Social media during an important event; (10) Support-seeking through social media; (11) Social media in the public sector; and (12) Traditional/social media divide.",

SNA models \u201crelations and associations, developments and associations and dynamic forces in networks and activities on social media platforms\u201d [2]. Although SNA has been used more so in social and behavioural sciences [3, 4], more recently it has also been applied to \u201cmore complex areas\u201d including economics, business and medicine [5]. SNA is also observed as a group of theories, practices and instruments [6]. This phenomenon is well summarized as being typically rooted in three main beliefs [7]: (1) Networks\u2019 structure and characteristics influence system performance; (2) Actors\u2019 position in a network impacts their behaviour; and (3) Actors\u2019 behaviour is in conformity with their network environment.",

This study argues that when social networks are successful, it has wider societal impact, which can affect programs, projects, policies, strategies, and partnerships (including its designs, implementations and results) [8] through access to human, social and financial information [5]. Therefore, social media grew central to civil society discourse \u2013 a platform where public debate and disputes, as well as knowledge exchange occur. As the public pulpit, social media exchanges are as important to note as any other large public gathering. Network maps of public social media discussions in services like Twitter can provide insights into the role social media plays in our society. These features and the size of online social networks puts SNA central to address many problems globally. This prevalence of increased user activities among social media users allow people to be more connected than ever before across the globe [13].",

Similarly, the number of other accounts that have arrows pointing towards each Twitter account, is known as in-degree centrality. In this context, in-degree is regarded as a measure of popularity [29]. Out-degree centrality then refers to the number of arrows directed away from the Tweeter.

Betweenness Centrality is a measure of how often a given vertex lies on the shortest path between two other vertices [20].

Closeness centrality describes the mean distance between a vertex and every second vertex in the social network [2]. Presuming vertices can only deliver messages to or effect its existing linkages (vertices), low closeness centrality requires the Tweeter to be directly linked to, or \u201cjust a hop away\u201d [20] from, the majority other vertices in the social network. Eigenvector centrality (contrary to degree centrality), explicitly supports vertices that are connected to other similar vertices. Eigenvector centrality network metric considers, not only the number of vertex connections (its degree), but moreover the vertices\u2019 degree to which it is connected [30].

However, what this also say, is that this is an influential account, which is quite vocal and mentions many others in the account\u2019s discussion on #NHI. Therefore, by referring to others, the authoring account is extracting them into the linkage or engaging with them for a second time, if they were previously in the network. The out-degree of a Twitter account refers to mentions in the network, i.e. the number of arrows pointing away from it or the number of accounts it replies to. It is thus an indication of attention which an account points to others [30].",

In this inquiry, Twitter, a very widely used social media platform was used to gather big data, using the hashtag #NHI. The choice of this hashtag was a result of the controversies and uncertainties created among South Africans with the unveiling of the National Health Insurance Bill for discussion in parliament. This inquiry was grounded in graph and network theory in order to conduct a social network analysis of the national conversation of #NHI. This resulted in a visual graph model based on 4112 #NHI tweets, done by 1 902 Twitter users (vertices) indicating 4 110 Twitter interactions (edges). The key influential actors in this SNA was the Minister of Health, the media and to a limited degree, citizens of South Africa who will be influenced by the bill. The degree distributions revealed that relationships between the major #NHI Twitter users were limited, as the majority of closeness and eigenvector centrality indicated low connectivity. This could indicate the lack of involvement of the South African citizens in public discourse around the NHI bill which will affect all South African. From the preceding discussions, it is clear that social media is inevitably central to modern day society, with widespread influence that cannot be refuted or disregarded. In this paper, it was demonstrated how big, real-time data from Twitter can be employed using NodeXL Pro, to draw insights through social media metrics with visualizations. The paper further demonstrated NodeXL Pro as an enabler to harness big unstructured data which are mass-produced on a daily basis. More so, that it enables, through using appropriate analytic techniques, inference from seemingly uncoordinated microblogs that may assist businesses and governments alike in decision-making. The #NHI case study further reinforces that emerging economics are part of the social media race.",
