Microbial pollution around the world is routinely assessed using concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including Escherichia coli and enterococci as proxies for pathogenic organisms (Wyn-Jones et al., 2011). Such bacteria are present in the feces (Stachler et al., 2017), runoff (Molina et al., 2014) and sewage discharges (Jennings et al., 2018), and their presence is a considerable issue concerning river risk management and human health risk (Chenar and Deng, 2018). As a type of FIB, fecal coliform (FC) has been widely used in the risk assessment of microbial pollution in water (Boehm et al., 2018; Uprety et al., 2020). The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the European Environment Agency (EEA) both use FC as one of the microbiological indicators of drinking water quality. The FC index is particularly important especially in areas where marine products are abundant (Wang and Deng, 2019). Previous studies have reported two significant observations of the worldwide FC situation. On the one hand, FC is inherently bioactive, differing from other physical and chemical pollutants, and the reported amount of microbial pollution in the environment has raised concerns regarding ecosystem and human health (Frena et al., 2019). On the other hand, the state and concentration of FC in water bodies are dynamic and are related to environmental factors (Chen and Liu, 2017; Carpenter et al., 2019; Jeon et al., 2019).",

            "text": "A growing body of research has proven that the dynamic nature of FC survival and concentration in surface water bodies is driven by emissions and environmental factors that determine FC transport and fate (Mitch et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2015). FC can reproduce rapidly under optimal environmental conditions for growth, and reproduction varies with factors such as water temperature, temperature, solar radiation, rainfall and turbidity (Leight et al., 2016; Chen and Liu, 2017). Regression models can be applied to explore how one environmental factor affects FC levels while the remaining factors are fixed; however, it usually has poor fitness. This result may be due to the complicated and nonlinear relationship between environmental factors and FC (Fan et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2016; Wang and Deng, 2019). Several additional studies have investigated the link between land-use types and FC concentration, including urban development levels, agriculture-dominated watersheds and comparisons of different watershed types (Sliva, 2001; Walters et al., 2011; Chow et al., 2013; Mcmichael et al., 2013; Badgley et al., 2019). Vitro et al. (2017) found that road density was positively correlated with FC contamination and negatively related to the area of water body. In addition, regions with water quality degradation due to nutrients usually have high FC concentrations, and this result has been found in other studies (Mallin et al., 2000). Forest and grass may be positively correlated with FC concentrations in water bodies because these landscapes provide places for poultry breeding (Smith et al., 2001). Together, these studies have indicated that the watershed-scale FC dynamics could be predicted by examining FC occurrence and concentration data coupled with environmental factors. However, the limited scope of these monitoring datasets and the combination of landscape patterns related to the transmission path of non-point source pollution (NPS) have not allowed for generalizable conclusions regarding how such programs coupled with environmental factors impact the contaminant levels in a complex watershed with mixed land-use types.",

However, water environment management in the Beiyun River is extremely challenging. The region is experiencing rapid urbanization, and FC management should have regional characteristics. Accordingly, a total of 21 water quality sampling sites (S1\u2013S21) were selected along the mainstream and its tributaries as well as the confluence, considering the characteristics of the main stream, urbanization level, land use patterns and accessibility. Thereafter, the watershed boundaries and river network were delineated in ArcGIS with the hydrological module based on the digital elevation model (DEM, 30 m resolution). Taking each of the sampling sites as the outlet of a delineated catchment, the catchment areas (C1\u2013C21 responding to S1\u2013S21) were determined for further study. The catchments could be divided into five categories represented by five urban patterns with different urbanization levels (Fig. 1\n) considering spatial land-use types (Fig. 2\n). In pattern 1 (P1, C1\u2013C3) and pattern 5 (P5, C19\u2013C21), impervious surfaces accounted for less than 30%, which represented a low urbanization level. However, the difference between P1 and P5 was that there was a large part of forestland in P1, while cultivated land was dominant in P5. In P2 (C4\u2013C10) and P4 (C17\u2013C18), the impervious surface ratio was between 30% and 60%, indicating a moderate urbanization level. The central areas were characterized by a relatively higher percentage of impervious surfaces occupying approximately 80%, which were regarded as urban pattern with high urbanization level (P3).",

To ensure that no contamination occurred, sample collection was taken prior to field measurements at each sampling site. Sample bottles were conditioned in-stream by rinsing three times with stream water before retaining the sample. Samples were immediately placed in a cooler after sampling and shipped to the Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, for FC analysis within 24 h.",

Therefore, to weaken the influence of point sources, FC analysis in P3 was divided into the rainy season and dry season. The pollution load increment in the rainy season was regarded as the NPS input. Many researchers employ the rainy season and dry season when exploring the spatiotemporal changes in water quality according to precipitation (Luo et al., 2018; Han et al., 2020). Therefore, June, July and August were regarded as the rainy season in this study. March, April and November were the dry seasons of 2017, while October, November and December were the dry months of 2018 according to the monthly rainfall amount in Fig. S2. Simultaneously, the selected dry seasons excluded the snow months. The FC concentration caused by NPS was calculated by Eq. (4). The monthly flow data of each sampling section were necessary when calculating the increment of pollution load. The monthly flow data from 2013 to 2018 of two hydrological stations in the Beiyun watershed were obtained from the local Environmental Protection Bureau, based on which SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was calibrated and verified to simulate the monthly average streamflow of each river section. Model performance and parameter selection are shown in Fig. 3\nand Table 2\n. Monthly SWAT-simulated streamflow can be judged as satisfactory with R2 > 0.6 and E\nNS>0.5 according to previous study (Moriasi et al., 2015). Thereafter, the response relationship between NPS pollution and landscape patterns in urban areas was carried out using Lasso.(4)CNPS=Crainy\u00d7Qrainy\u2212Cdry\u00d7QdryQrainywhere CNPS is the concentration of FC caused by NPS, Crainy and Cdry are the FC concentrations in the rainy seasons and dry seasons, respectively, and Qrainy and Qdry are the streamflow in the rainy seasons and dry seasons, respectively.",

In addition, the whole watershed was highly polluted by FC in December and January. Studies have shown that the FC concentration was approximately 10 times higher in snowmelt runoff (Galfi et al., 2016; Dila et al., 2018), which corresponds to the snowy months of January and December in the Beiyun watershed. Consequently, the existence of FC in the dry seasons would be more complicated, indicating a detailed study should be carried out in the next step.",

Leight et al (2016) claimed that rainfall events larger than 1 inch tended to result in a significant increase in FC for the following two days. The large area of impermeable surface in urban areas is more conducive to FC entering the stream with stormwater runoff; thus, a higher Ra meant a quick and sensitive response to rainfall input in areas with a high urbanization level (P3). Ra values of 1\u201310 were mainly distributed along the lower Beiyun River (the regions of P4 and P5), which were urban-rural mixed areas and rural-cultivated dominated areas, respectively. However, the monitoring sites located at upstream exhibited different degrees of dilution, where the land-use types were dominated by forest. Forestland as a sink landscape can reduce NPS pollutants into water bodies, which supports the conclusion of a previous study in which the proportion of forest cover was negatively correlated with FC within a watershed (Mello et al., 2018).",

S14\u2013S19). The spatiotemporal regression models are shown in Table 3\n. In this study, the FC concentration in the Beiyun River responded more actively to a combination of environmental factors, indicating that multiple environmental factors should be used to explain FC levels in water bodies. This result is consistent with previous studies (Thoe et al., 2014; Leight et al., 2016; Badgley et al., 2019; Wang and Deng, 2019). However, the temporal dynamics of FC in P3 failed due to other complex anthropogenic influences in the urban areas, particularly from the point source input. As shown in Fig. S20, it was found that most failures in the regression models were consistent with the distribution and annual discharge of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Beiyun watershed. This result agrees with Boehm et al. (2018), who found that FC pollution in surface water will greatly increase due to the discharge of sewage water. It can be seen that the WWTPs with high discharge are mainly located in P3, indicating that point source discharge is another important source of FC pollution in this region. Consequently, this may be the main reason why FC cannot be explained by environmental factors in P3.",

It seems that the urban pattern of P2, which was characterized by a typical urban-rural mixed region, was undergoing a complex FC source situation. All of the models showed a positive correlation between FC and SS (Zimmer-Faust et al., 2018). Previous studies have also reported that SS was positively associated with FC concentration, indicating that suspended solid might be as a more suitable place to survive than in water (Fang et al., 2018). There is a negative correlation between rainfall and FC concentration in P1, where the forest land accounted for a considerable proportion. Badgley et al. (2019) also found that natural forest negatively associated with FC. Interestingly, solar radiation was identified as another significant predictor of FC, having a negative association, which may mask the high concentration of FC caused by stormwater runoff in the wet season; this result may be especially true in April\u2013June, which have the highest solar radiation (Fig. S6) and initial rainfall events that will bring numerous pollutants due to long antecedent dry days. The lower FC concentration during the months of September\u2013November was mainly inhabited by living conditions, such as lower air temperature and water temperature (a positive correlation between FC and them). A previous study also showed that the optimal growth water temperatures of E. coli ranged from 25 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C (Noor et al., 2013).",

The spatial difference was mainly driven by the land use distribution that was used to distinguish different urban patterns. The spatial model in this study suggested that agricultural land, impervious land and industry were the dominant sources of the fecal pollution. This result is consistent with Crim et al. (2012), who focused on watersheds with different land uses in four countries. Unexpectedly, forest was identified as a significant factor with a positive correlation. In previous studies, forest was negatively associated with fecal pollution in surface water and has been suggested as a sink landscape (Vitro et al., 2017; Badgley et al., 2019), while only some studies, such as Smith et al. (2001), indicated a positive correlation. This may depend to a large extent on the characteristics of the watersheds, and for the studied urban watershed, the artificial forest is planted in the urban areas with a large amount of added fertilizer, which may be the source landscape of FC. Besides, population density and road density together represent the urbanization level but show opposite trends for the interpretation of FC. Roads are an important place for pollutant accumulation, while areas with high population density often have complete sewage treatment systems that reduce the discharge of FC in domestic sewage. Same conclusion was made by Vitro et al. (2017). Importantly, the sustained urban NPS caused by rapid urbanization may account for a considerable proportion of FC pollution (Bonkosky et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2015; Mattioli et al., 2017). The correlations between environmental factors and fecal pollution are expected to be conserved across watersheds with similar land-use patterns, although specific relationships may need to be recalibrated to more accurately explain fecal pollution and identify the main source.",

The model showed that the fragmentation of impervious surfaces could effectively reduce NPS-FC because of the negative correlation between FCNPS and PDurban. Thus, in areas with high urbanization levels, reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces can significantly decrease the NPS-FC. As a result, low impact development (LID) could be used as an effective measure to alleviate this problem (Ishaq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). However, numerous authors have observed that streambeds may be the bacterial reservoir for FC, which could be released during high-flow events (Garzio-Hadzick et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010). At the same time, Kim et al. (2010) noted that streambed release could not be considered during rainfall events, as the stream would be dominated by surface runoff during that period, even at high streamflow. In this study, NPS-FC pollution at both seasonal and event scales was discussed without considering streambed release. Thus, an underestimation or overestimation of runoff impact may exist.",

All subsets regression for the best three models are reported in Table 5\n. Using these results, this study, for the first time, explained the spatial characteristics of NPS-FC in a complex watershed based on landscape metrics at the event scale. The variables of grassland, forest and water, which refer to the proportions of land-use types, showed negative effects on the NPS-FC, while impervious surface and cultivated land showed positive correlations. This result was also demonstrated in previous studies (Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006; Shen et al., 2014; Holcomb et al., 2018; Nel et al., 2018). In regions of P2 and P4, where urban-rural areas with medium levels of urbanization existed, the fragmentation of rural areas and forests as well as the complexity of impervious surfaces and rural areas (characterized by PDrural, PDfor, LSIurban and LSIrural) explained the vulnerability of water bodies affected by NPS-FC pollution input. Moreover, the fragmentation of impervious surfaces (characterized by PDurban) could be an effective way to indicate NPS-FC based on the negative relationship between them.",

However, the nurseries, orchards, and wetlands were distributed in areas other than upstream, and these land types require artificial maintenance and fertilization. Research conducted by Liu et al.

Therefore, water management strategies in complex watersheds should be reconsidered based on more detailed characteristics so that managers might identify the best policy decisions for regional watershed management. Variables that are driven by natural forces are difficult to change, but the impact of SS and landscape may be altered by the thoughtful design of city planning and runoff management facilities. For instance, in this study, controlling SS can effectively reduce FC because of the strong correlation between them in different urban patterns. However, more factors should be considered in urban areas. Kim et al. (2010) indicated that turbidity might be the best indicator of fecal pollution at low streamflow. Thus, the combination of source and process control realized by LID may effectively relieve fecal pollution in water bodies (Fletcher et al., 2015). Few studies have reported that macrophyte roots provide a larger surface area for microbe removal in water (Shingare et al., 2019). Specifically, the control of pollutant build-up and wash-off processes on roads and the restoration of the ecological function of water bodies would be a long-term strategy for FC management (Jeon et al., 2019).",

The study of the correlation between NPS-FC and landscape patterns showed that FC can be improved by reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces with grasslands. For example, Ra will decrease by 5\u201310 times with a doubled level of fragmentation of impervious land according to the all subsets regression. It is especially true in areas with high urbanization levels that the NPS concentration of FC decreased exponentially with the increase in fragmentation of impervious surface. In addition, the forestland affected by human activities should be considered due to its spatial instability. Future site-specific work is needed to track the sources of FC at different urban levels and explore the efficiency of LID facilities on FC. The results from the current study provide key information that may be helpful for complex watershed management.",

In addition, the prediction models between FC concentration and environmental factors could be highly variable depending on urbanization levels. Regression analyses revealed that controlling SS can effectively reduce FC because of the strong correlation between them in different urban patterns, while more factors should be considered in urban. As such, future prediction of fecal pollution may require an urbanization context rather than a universal situation. Both the event-scale and seasonal-scale regression analyses showed that key landscape metrics could successfully explain the NPS-FC in a complex watershed. Reducing the connectivity of impervious surfaces in urban areas can be an effective measure to control NPS pollution of FC.
