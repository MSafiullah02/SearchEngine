Most western countries decided to vaccinate at-risk groups while the general population was advised to adopt preventive measures to avoid or mitigate transmission.",

As expected, there was a decrease of the adoption of preventive measures. In addition, we have found that respiratory hygiene and hand washing were the most frequently preventive measures adopted. These two measures are considered as effective non-pharmaceutical public health interventions against influenza (Aledort et al., 2007). The high prevalence of both measures is consistent with the government campaign (Spanish Ministry of Health, 2009b). Clearly, 2009 influenza A (H1N1) impacted on health-related perceptions and behaviors in terms of self-protection, as approximately 80% of respondents adopted at least one preventive measure. Some of these behaviors persisted among a large proportion of the population after the pandemic peak, although a significant decrease was observed during the declining phase.",

In our study, the proportion of respondents who purchased face masks (3.9% and 1.9% in the first and second waves, respectively) was lower than the proportion reported by other European countries during the pre-pandemic peak phase (7%) (Goodwin et al., 2009), the USA (5%) (Steel Fisher et al., 2010) and Malaysia (8%)(Goodwin et al., 2009). There were also wide regional differences in the prevalence of wearing a face mask, ranking between 22% and 89% in previous Asian studies (Lau et al., 2010a), again much higher than the proportion we found in Spain (7%). The same pattern was observed for avoidance measures. The proportion of Spanish general population reporting keeping away from crowded places was 4% while in Asian countries it was around 55% (Lau et al., 2010b). This might be explained by a higher public concern in those countries regarding the threat of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the human avian H5N1 virus a few years ago (Tang and Wong, 2003).",

            "text": "One of the limitations of this study was the use of telephone surveys, which excluded those households without telephone line. While this is a potential selection bias that cannot be ruled out completely, the magnitude is limited since more than 80% of households have a landline in Spain (Spanish National Institute of Statistics, 2010). More important is that we obtained a response rate of 33% which is nevertheless in the range of other published studies (Lau et al., 2010a, Rubin et al., 2009). Finally, since cultural factors could result in differences in behavioral responses, caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other contexts.",
