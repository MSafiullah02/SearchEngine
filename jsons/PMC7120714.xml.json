            "text": "Gene expression profiling (GEP) via DNA microarrays has been used extensively in cancer research to study disease mechanisms and make predictions of clinical outcomes. A typical microarray data analysis focuses on the selection of individual genes. For example, to identify differentially expressed genes under different conditions, one typically calculates a statistic and p value for each gene, followed by multiple comparison adjustments since normally tens of thousands of genes are measured in a microarray experiment. To select genes for predicting clinical outcomes, one can resort to methods such as semi-supervised principal component analysis (SuperPC) [1], partial least squares [2], Lasso [3], random forest [4], and so on. However, this type of analysis can miss some important genes whose individual contributions to a particular outcome may be moderate but whose combined effects are significant. Another limitation of the individual-gene approach is frequently inconsistent gene findings from similar studies conducted by different institutes [5, 6]. These problems of the individual-gene analysis were discussed in Mootha et al. [7] and Subramanian et al. [8], where they proposed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) idea, incorporatingprior biological knowledge into the analysis routine to identify important genes through gene sets. Since then many new statistical methods have been proposed for making inference on associations or predictions at gene set levels instead of individual-gene levels.",

            "text": "A gene set is a group of genes related in certain ways (e.g., they may be from the same pathway or perform similar molecular functions). There are public databases holding such information, for example those with the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations [9] and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathways [10]. For differential expression analysis, a gene set method aims to determine via hypothesis testing whether a gene set as a whole is associated with an outcome of interest. Examples include the pioneering GSEA algorithm [8], the Global Test [11], ANCOVA Global Test [12], SAM-GS [13], and GSA [14], to name just a few. For biomarker discovery, i.e. finding genes to build models for diagnostic/prognostic purposes, the idea of incorporating gene set information is to improve both performance and interpretability of resulting models. Tai and Pan [15] proposed a modified linear discriminant analysis (LDA) approach for classification by regularizing the covariance matrix and incorporating correlations among the genes within gene sets. With simulated and real datasets plus information from KEGG pathways, they showed that the new approach performed better than not incorporating the correlations within gene sets. Chen and Wang [16] proposed a two-step procedure: first to create a \u201csuper gene score\u201d using SuperPC [1] within each a priori gene set obtained from GO and then to use Lasso or SuperPC again to build a final model based on the super gene scores. With two survival microarray data they demonstrated that their gene set-based models enjoyed improved prediction accuracy and generated more biologically interpretable results. Ma et al. [17] also took a two-step approach, where they first divided genes into clusters by k-means, followed by applying Lasso within each cluster to get refined gene clusters, and then they selected important gene clusters with group Lasso [18]. Luan and Li [19] proposed a group additive regression model to incorporatepathway information and the use of gradient descent boosting for model fitting. With both simulations and a real microarray survival dataset, they showed improved accuracy by their method when compared to not using gene group information.",

In the individual-gene analysis, neither the gene selection nor theprediction process utilizes any biological information. For the gene set analysis, we first identify important genes within a priori gene sets to create summary gene set scores, and we then use the gene set scores as predictors for constructing predictive models. We explore four myeloma microarray datasets and three types of gene sets, and demonstrate that predictive accuracy depends on both the method and the type of gene sets being investigated. In the next section we first introduce our datasets from myeloma research. We then describe the analysis methods in Sect. 3 and show our results from applying the methods to the myeloma datasets in Sect. 4. Finally in Sect. 5, we conclude with a comparison of our results with findings reported by others.",

            "text": "All GEP datasets used in this investigation were from the Myeloma Institute (MI) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow, with symptoms such as elevated calcium, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions (the so-called CRAB symptoms). Normal plasma cells produce many immunoglobulins (antibodies) that the body needs to identify and fight pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. With MM, abnormal plasma cells from a single clone accumulate and eventually crowd out normal plasma cells, causing the body to produce only one type of immunoglobulin. It is not clear what causes MM, but it is characterized by genetic abnormalities such as gene mutations and translocations. For example, deletions of chromosome 17p and P53 gene mutations have been linked to poor clinical outcomes in numerous MM studies. Typically prior to developing MM, abnormal plasma cells accumulate in the body and the patient undergoes an asymptomatic phase, comprising monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Compared to MGUS, SMM has more abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and higher levels of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein) in the serum. Both MGUS and SMM patients lack the CRAB symptoms that define MM. However, MGUS patients have an approximately 1% risk per year of developing MM [20]. Among patients with SMM, about 10% annually will progress to MM within 5 years, and after the 5-year mark the progression rate is similar to MGUS [21].",

An interesting finding at the time was a lack of ability of the models to discriminate between MGUS and MM at the gene expression level. Based on the newer platform U133Plus2, and more samples, we aimed to do a more refined analysis in this investigation, specifically to identify signature genes and build predictive models to distinguish between (1) normal and MGUS, (2) MGUS and SMM, (3) SMM and MM, and (4) P53 deletion and no deletion in MM. The MM patients in this study were enrolled in a series of Total Therapy (TT) clinical trials, with the MGUS/SMM patients in two observational clinical trials (SWOG S0120 and MI M0120). P53 deletion was determined at baseline by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH). For GEP, purified plasma cells (PC) by CD138 expression were obtained from normal healthy subjects and the MM (MGUS/SMM) patientsprior to therapy (at registration of the observational trials). Microarray raw intensity values were preprocessed and normalized using the MAS5 algorithm provided by the manufacturer, and the normalized data also went through batch effect checking and corrections [23].",

Each gene set groups certain genes together that share a particular biological property. GO BP gene sets contain genes associated with biological processes, each of which is made up of many chemical reactions or events leading to chemical transformations. However, the GO BP gene sets are a broad category and do not necessarily comprise co-regulated genes.

A decision tree model based on recursive partitioning has the advantage of easy interpretation. In a random forest model, many decision trees are built by utilizing bootstrap samples and results from each tree are aggregated by majority voting to make final predictions. By building each tree to the fullest, the method is able to achieve low bias, and by aggregating results from many trees it can also achieve low variance. Importantly, a random forest considers only a random subset of the variables at each split. Doing so allows it to (1) produce less similar bootstrap samples and trees and therefore low variance at the end, and (2) identify a diverse set of important variables associated with the outcome of interest even when there is multicollinearity in the data.

We compared the two types of analysis by calculating differences in error rates. For example, suppose in individual-gene analysis we used the Lasso, then we would compare it with those gene set methods that employed Lasso in 2nd step of the gene set analysis such as ccscore.lasso, score.lasso, pcscore.lasso, and lasso.lasso. By doing such comparisons, one can gauge whether step 1 of the gene set analysis is necessary\u2014without step 1 the gene set analysis just reduces to individual-gene analysis. Table 7 lists reductions in error rate by using gene set analysis compared to individual-gene analysis in all such comparisons. Note that each gene set method was applied for each disease comparison three times, each time utilizing a different kind of gene sets (either GO BP, hallmark, or positional), while each individual-gene method was applied only once for each disease comparison. Thus when calculating the differences in error rate, we replicated those error rates of the individual-gene methods three times. We can see in Table 7 that both the method and the type of gene sets affected whether there was any improvement in performance by doing gene set analysis, where improvement was measured by reduction in error rate. We highlighted those scenarios when the reductions in error rate by doing gene set analysis were somewhat meaningful (\u22650.04), although 0.04 is an arbitrary choice. The fact that there are both positive and negative values in Table 7 indicates that sometimes individual-gene analysis was better than gene set analysis in terms of prediction accuracy. Averaged reductions in error rate were also calculated for each gene set method in comparison to an appropriate individual-gene method (last column of Table 7). By this measure, all 15 gene set methods except two produced more accurate models with reduced error rates. Figure 1 provides a visualization of the reductions in error rate. Despite the variations, overall across all the methods, gene set analysis reduced error rates by 0.02 on average, and 25% of the time by at least 0.05.\n\n",

To have a focused discussion here, we consider only the ccscore and ccscore. lasso methods in this subsection and the next, as respectively they were among the top methods used in the individual-gene and gene set analysis. It appears that both the individual-gene and gene set methods were able to classify SMM versus MM and P53 deletion versus no deletion very well with error rates varying between 0.06 and 0.10. Clinically, SMM is characterized by a higher percentage of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and higher levels of M-protein in the serum than MGUS. Thus being able to classify SMM versus MM implies being able to discriminate between MGUS and MM as well. It turned out that our hypothesis was right when we went to verify it\u2014the test set error rate for discriminating between MGUS and MM by an individual-gene analysis with the ccscore was 0.099. This is contradictory to the findings reported in Hardin et al. [22], where all the models failed to classify MGUS versus MM. A couple of factors could be the cause here. First, the newer microarray platform U133Plus2 covers the whole genome more comprehensively than the older platform, so there is a better chance to detect differentiable genes and therefore create more powerful models. Second, we had more MGUS samples in this investigation: 73 compared to 21 in Hardin et al. [22], while the MM samples in both investigations were plenty (174 in ours and 218 in Hardin et al.). Nonetheless, the difficult case for us was to discriminate between MGUS and SMM, as the error rates for this classification were between 0.3 and 0.37 for the individual-gene and gene set analysis. This indicates that at the molecular level MGUS and SMM are different for the most part, yet they share certain genetic features that make them less indistinguishable. Also interesting were the error rates for classifying MGUS versus normal varied between 0.16 and 0.21.",

At this point careful interpretation of the results is warranted. When using CD138 expression to isolate plasma cells (PC) before GEP\u2014a standard procedure routinely performed at the Myeloma Institute, the MGUS/SMM PC samples were infiltrated with normal PC, while the MM PC samples were largely abnormal. Consequently, some of the differentially expressed genes we identified between MGUS/SMM PC and MM PC samples might be due to differences in the amount of normal PC in the samples rather than due to disease differences. This problem was less when comparing normal versus MGUS and MGUS versus SMM PC samples, as they were more comparable in terms of the amount of normal PC in the samples.",

With both simulated and real datasets, their method was shown to perform better than not incorporatingpathway information (e.g., when compared to PAM [35], which considers genes as independent). Genes are naturally not independent from each other, therefore the improvements by their method were reasonable and expected. Importantly, our ccscore/score/pcscore methods already draw strength by combining correlated genes. As Park et al. [36] have shown, averaging genes within gene clusters can improve prediction accuracy. Our score method is essentially an extension of the averaged gene expression method to account for genes with both positive and negative correlations with the outcome. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, it would be interesting to apply their approach and PAM on myeloma datasets in future research. Further investigations on the genes identified to examine whether the gene set analysis could provide more coherent biological insights into the myeloma disease mechanisms would be another avenue of research.",
