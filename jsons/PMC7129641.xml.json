The pET24 derivative carrying the SMT3 gene of S. cerevisiae, which encodes the yeast SUMO protein, has been described previously pSUMO [26]. It contains an N-terminal hexahistidine (6\u00d7 His) tag, introduced by PCR into the SUMO coding sequence, as well as a unique BsaI site at the C-terminus. The cloning strategy to express fusion proteins employed this BsaI site to insert the SARS-CoV protein coding sequences in frame with SUMO. PCR primers (Table 1\n) incorporating this site or Esp 3I were used to amplify the SARS-CoV coding sequences from cDNA clones carried in pTOPO vectors. The 3\u2032 primers carried a BamHI site for insertion into the multiple cloning site of pET24d. The primer pairs used to PCR amplify the SARS-CoV protein genes are listed in Table 1. Because of its large size, Spike protein was designed as two half-molecules, S1 (N-terminal fragment, amino acids 1\u2013667, SpK N) and S2 (C-terminal fragment, amino acids 668\u20131193, SpK C) domains and the Spk C was tested for expression and purification in this study. For PCR amplification of the genes of interest, a proofreading polymerase was used (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR fragments were subcloned into pET24-6\u00d7 His-SUMO or pET24-6\u00d7 His (a parallel vector that does not carry the SUMO sequence) to produce parallel sets of constructs encoding 6\u00d7 His-SUMO and 6\u00d7 His fused versions of the proteins of interest. All plasmids were routinely sequenced.",

The cell lysate containing soluble SUMO-3CL was used for this purification, because a majority of the expressed protein (>80%) was present in the soluble fraction (data not shown). Proteins without 6\u00d7 His tags were removed from the Ni\u2013NTA resin using wash buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, and the 6\u00d7 His-tagged SUMO-3CL-fusion was eluted using elution buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. After the SUMO-3CL fractions were pooled, the sample was dialyzed extensively against PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C to remove high salt and imidazole, which would interfere with the cleavage reaction. The SUMO-fusion was cleaved by addition of SUMO protease at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h under the conditions described in Materials and methods. The completeness of cleavage was confirmed by checking the proteins on a 12% SDS-gel, since the band of the SUMO-3CL disappeared and two new bands corresponding to the expected molecular weights of SUMO and 3CL were detected. After the cleaved sample was re-applied to a Ni\u2013NTA column to subtract 6\u00d7 His-tagged SUMO and SUMO protease, final purified 3CL was obtained (Fig. 5); the protein from the subtracted sample ran as a single, intense band (\u223c34 kDa), indicating that 3CL had been purified successfully (>95% purity). In this experiment, a high yield (totally \u223c56 mg) of the pure 3CL was achieved from 1 L of E. coli cultured and induced at 20 \u00b0C overnight (Table 2\n). We used the anti-SUMO-3CL-fusion antibody to identify the purified 3CL protein, since the antibody could react with the SUMO-3CL-fusion and their cleaved partners. The purified protein was confirmed to be the SARS-CoV 3CL by the Western blot probed with the anti-SUMO-3CL antibody (see below and Fig. 7).",

Briefly, the 6\u00d7 His-tagged SUMO-Spike C-fusion was eluted by elution buffer containing 300 mM imidazole, but a few other minor proteins that were without 6\u00d7 His tags but possibly rich in histidine and/or cysteine were also bound to the resin, resulting in impurities of the sample.

Another problem encountered is inaccessibility of the cleavage site within the fusion due to steric constraints, which could reduce the effectiveness of enzymic cleavage. The SUMO tag, by contrast, is accurately and efficiently removed from the protein of interest [26].

            "text": "Ubiquitin has been reported to exert chaperoning effects on fused proteins, thus increasing expression of proteins in E. coli and yeast [34], [35], [36]. The fused proteins can be cleaved by Ub-proteases (both UCH and UBP classes), but the enzymes are unstable, difficult to produce, and often must be used in large quantities (an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:1), making this technology impractical for large-scale protein production [18]. Our laboratory has exploited the chaperoning properties of several ubiquitin-like proteins including SUMO, and the extreme robustness of SUMO protease has allowed us to develop a technology that provides both enhanced expression and cleavage of the fusion protein. A number of difficult proteins have been expressed in our laboratory in both unfused and SUMO-fused forms and compared side-by-side to demonstrate that SUMO-fusion dramatically enhances the expression of many types of proteins, including membrane proteins, and that SUMO protease cleaves a variety of SUMO-fusions with high specificity and efficiency over a wide range of various conditions, including pH (5.5\u201310.5) and temperature (4\u201337 \u00b0C) [26]. Non-specific cleavage of the substrate was not observed, even when the amount of enzyme was deliberately increased to a 1:1 ratio [26]. In this study, titration of the hydrolytic capacity of SUMO protease on the purified SARS-CoV Nc proteins confirmed that SUMO protease is an extremely potent enzyme (Fig. 8). The predicted molecular weight of the SUMO protease is 26.7 kDa, though it usually runs at \u223c31 kDa position on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel.",

We established a batch production protocol employing 20 \u00b0C overnight growth for large-scale expression of SUMO-SARS-CoV proteins, since a shorter time (e.g., 6 h) or higher temperature (37 \u00b0C) resulted in lower yields, especially for soluble proteins (data not shown). Although in most cases, cells growing in rich medium (LB) produced more SUMO-fused protein than cells growing in minimal medium (MM), we will use MM to investigate secreted SARS-CoV proteins in future studies, since rich medium contains a large number of interfering proteins.",

The expressed and purified SARS-CoV proteins had immunological activity, but the question remains concerning their functional activities. It appears, at least in the case of one SARS-CoV protein, that SUMO-enhanced expression and purification from E. coli results in active protein. In a study to be published, SUMO-fusion enhanced expression of the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the purified soluble RdRp was biologically active (unpublished results). Finally, we recently observed that SUMO-fusion significantly enhanced expression and purification of SARS-CoV membrane protein (M) as well. Using the SUMO-fusion technology described here, the expression level of SARS-CoV M protein in E. coli was greatly improved, and the insoluble proteins extracted from the bacterial inclusion bodies were purified [32]. Application of the various purified SARS-CoV proteins to the development of SARS vaccines and functional assays are underway.",
