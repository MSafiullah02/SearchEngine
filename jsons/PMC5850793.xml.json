The flies were left unfed to prevent introducing additional bacteria. Drosophila virilis were obtained from Dr. Kimberly Carlson at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, Kearney, NE. Drosophila virilis were maintained in bottles of pasteurized fly food (standard cornmeal, molasses, and torula yeast medium). All flies were used within 3 d of emergence.",

Flies were allowed to walk on the plate for a period of 5 min, while the plate was rotated or gently tapped to encourage fly movement and to prevent cleaning. It had been previously shown that blowflies picked up the largest quantity of insecticide during the first minute exposed, so in this study it was decided that we use a little longer time period for bacterial exposure and variation in the size of flies (Lewis and Hughes 1957).

Twenty-two flies were aseptically removed from their containers and placed on a 24 h lawn of E. coli. In order to increase the likelihood of extended cleaning, E. coli was used because it was slightly more difficult to remove than P. aeruginosa based upon cleaning quantification. Flies were allowed to walk around for a period of 5 min. Controls were not exposed to bacteria but immediately placed into a sterile Petri plate to score cleaning. Flies were removed after 5 min and placed into sterile Petri plates. The cleaning behavior of the individual flies was observed with a dissecting microscope (Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, NY) for a period of 5 min in the sterile petri plate. Specific cleaning behaviors were scored from adaptation of Szebenyi (1969): prothoracic legs to mouth, prothoracic legs to head, prothoracic legs together, prothoracic legs cleaning mesothoracic legs, mesothoracic legs cleaning prothoracic legs, mesothoracic legs cleaning metathoracic legs, metathoracic legs cleaning wings, metathoracic legs cleaning body, metathoracic legs rubbing together, and metathoracic legs cleaning mesothoracic legs were counted.

Our results show that D. virilis and S. bullata are able to remove a significant amount of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Surprisingly, M. domestica was only able to remove a significant amount of P. aeruginosa, but not E. coli. Differences in cell size are unlikely to account for the difference in bacterial removal as E. coli (1.1\u20131.5 \u00b5m \u00d7 1.5\u20135.0 \u00b5m) and P. aeruginosa cells (0.5\u20131.0 \u00b5m \u00d7 1.5\u20135.0 \u00b5m) are of similar size. Pace et al. (2017) also found a difference in the amount of bacteria that flies deposit. They found no difference in the amount of Salmonella enterica that blow flies (Phorma regina and M. domestica) acquired, but P. regina was able to deposit more of the bacteria onto lettuce leaves compared to M. domestica. These data suggest that S. enterica may adhere more strongly to M. domestica, which is consistent with our current study showing a reduced ability of M. domestica to remove E. coli.",

Escherichia coli expresses a variety of adhesins (e.g., pili, fimbriae) that may enable it to more strongly adhere to the housefly (Kalita et al. 2014). It has been demonstrated that pili on the surface of E. coli use a roll and stick adhesion mechanism and are, not only resistant to shear force, but activated by it (Thomas et al. 2004). The bacterium may also stick more strongly to the pulvillus, which is the sticky substance released by the glandular hairs of filth flies (Graczyk et al. 2001). In a study by Tan et al. (1997), it was shown that increased viscosity can make it more difficult for the house fly to remove materials adhering to the legs. It is possible that the E. coli create a more viscous solution that adheres to the fly bristles and hairs more strongly than other bacteria. The strain used in the study presented here (E. coli ATCC 25922) encodes a limited number of adhesins including papG (DR76_1632), fimH (DR76_2431), sfaD (K758_20486), and csgA (DR76_3880) (Minogue et al. 2014). Future studies will be needed to define the roles for E. coli ATCC 25922-encoded adhesins, as well as additional adhesins encoded by other pathogenic E. coli strains (Qin et al. 2013, McWilliams and Torres 2014) in adherence to the various fly species including M. domestica.",

After allowing time for cleaning, they also were able to remove similar amounts of bacteria, as the 5 and 10 min cleaning times were not significantly different for the three fly species. In a study by De Jes\u00fas et al. (2004), the number of E. coli that M. domestica could pick up from food and carry on their body were quantified to be up to 5.5 log10 CFU/fly. Our study indicates that the number of E. coli cells adhering to M. domestica flies was highly variable (\u223c5.5 log10\u20138 log10 CFU/fly). However, our results show that flies pick up similar amounts of bacteria when fly size is taken into account (Table 3). Another interesting finding was that D. virilis picked up significantly more P. aeruginosa than E. coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known pathogen of D. virilis that relies upon the twitching pathway to be pathogenic (D'Argenio et al. 2001). Twitching is a locomotor mechanism which relies upon type IV pili (Semmler et al. 1999). It is possible that the type IV pili could be used for attachment to the fly. It is not known why it would be higher in one species of fly, but there were differences in M. domestica\u2019s ability to remove E. coli as well. We may find bacterial adaptations for fly species that are yet unknown.",

Szebenyi (1969) characterized cleaning behavior in D. melanogaster as sweeping and rubbing that moved particles off the body, while Holloway (1976) observed that hover flies contaminated with pollen used tapping, combing, and eating to remove the pollen. In this study, flies that were exposed to bacterial contamination increased their cleaning behaviors significantly. They also used the combing or rubbing behavior to fling bacteria in aggregates off their bodies (Table 3). This action could be contributing to bacterial transmission, but it was also noted that they significantly increased the movement of the legs to the mouth. This would suggest that the flies could be eating the contaminating bacteria, although it was not quantified in this study. A recent publication by Nayduch and Burrus (2017) described the interaction of house flies and bacteria. Larval house flies eat bacteria as a nutritional requirement. This could be an important means of reducing bacterial loads on fly surfaces.",

It was demonstrated that M. domestica was able to remove similar amounts of E. coli (1.2 \u00d7 106 CFU) and P. aeruginosa (1.1 \u00d7 106 CFU) and transfer them to the surrounding surfaces.

(2008) found a significant reduction in bacteria from the wings of M. domestica when inoculated with Vibrio cholerae. Flight was also found to significantly reduce the amount of bacteria on flies; however, the proportion of bacteria retained on individual flies varied greatly. This study also reported that M. domestica was capable of removing 86% of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa, although the removal was only significant for P. aeruginosa due to the high level of variability for E. coli. The importance of cleaning seems supported by the fact that flies removed 86% of both E.coli and P. aeruginosa within 10 min of cleaning. However, flies in our study failed to remove all of the plate-acquired bacteria, which may shed insights into the ability of M. domestica to mechanically spread infectious agents for up to 8 d (Graczyk et al. 1999, Nayduch et al. 2002). Moreover, ingested bacteria are greatly reduced in the gut of the fly after 3\u20134 d but still can remain viable and be transferred via defecation (Kobayashi et al. 1999, Sasaki et al. 2000). This suggests a period of time where fly cleaning could greatly influence pathogen transmission, as bacteria would be expelled from the gut and transmitted again in their food, feces, or from fly-to-fly transmission.",

All three species of flies were able to reduce bacterial contamination on their bodies with increased cleaning activity, yet the cleaning process was also shown to contaminate the surrounding surfaces. Therefore, the length of time from exposure to the bacterial contamination and location of a host may be significant in the transmission of bacterial pathogens. Additional studies are necessary to quantify the effects of cleaning on other infectious microorganisms transmitted by flies including larger parasites and bacteria that produce very small endospores. These studies will help us to elucidate the real effects cleaning may have on the mechanical transmission of microbial pathogens.",
