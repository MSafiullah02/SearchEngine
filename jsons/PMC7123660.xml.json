            "text": "There are several groups of plant antimicrobials including saponins, thiosulfinates, glucosinolates, terpenoids, and polyphenols. Saponins are naturally occurring glycosides that may exhibit antimicrobial, hemolytic, membrane depolarizing, cholesterol binding, and allopathic activities (Naidu 2000). Thiosulfinates are related to garlic, which has been used as a medicinal plant since antiquity and possesses both static and cidal effects against microbes (Naidu 2000). Glucosinolates are bioactive compounds found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli (Naidu 2000). Terpenoids are secondary metabolites and are highly enriched in compounds based on an isoprene structure (Cowan 1999). Citral is a type of terpenoid that causes bacterial membrane disruption and the leakage of intracellular ions. Its action on the cell membrane also has dramatic effects on proton motive forces, intracellular ATP content, and the overall cell activity (Somolinos et al. 2010).",

The phenols and polyphenols are a group of bioactive chemicals which consist of a single substituted phenolic ring (Cowan 1999); different compounds vary in their C6 ring structure. In general, phenols or polyphenols exhibit the greatest antimicrobial efficacy of various plant origin compounds (Burt 2004). The antioxidant activity may occur via mechanisms such as scavenging of radicals and chelating of metal ions. The phenol, eugenol, reportedly participates in photochemical reactions (Mihara and Shibamoto 1982) and inhibits the production (Farag et al. 1989) and activity of enzymes (Wendakoon and Sakaguchi 1995). It may also causechanges in membrane permeability resulting from the exit of potassium ions (Walsh et al. 2003). Cell wall deterioration and lysis have also been observed (Thoroski et al. 1989).",

Red, blue, and purple berries, red and purple grapes, red wines, teas (especially green), apples, pears, raspberries, apples, onions, broccoli, soybeans, legumes, gingko biloba, and chocolate are common sources of polyphenols (Ullah and Khan 2008). Polyphenols exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-tumor, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties (Ullah and Khan 2008). Grape seed extract contains tannins, olive extract contains oleuropein, and green tea extract contains tannin and catechins. The high concentrations of epicatechin and catechin in grape seed extract and caffeic acid and epicatechin in green tea extracts account for their high antioxidant activities (Rababah et al. 2004).",

(2009) determined that hydroxytyrosol, a small-molecule phenolic compound extracted from olive tree leaves, did not prevent INFV-A strain H9N2 binding to host cells, but viral mRNA and proteins were absent once the virus entered the cells. The virus also appeared to be physically altered under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with ill-defined structure and the apparent loss of surface protein spikes. Similarly, Siddiqui et al. (1996) observed apparent dissolution of the viral envelopes of HSV-1 and NDV with both oregano and clove oil under TEM. Lai et al. (2012) also observed what appeared to be holes via TEM in the HSV-1 envelope following treatment with carvacrol and thymol. The following mechanisms appear to be the most relevant for enveloped viruses:Direct virucidal effect on the enveloped virus reducing the ability of the virus to infect host cells. Such activity does not appear to prevent virus adsorption to host cells but may include dissolution of the viral envelope or proteolytic activity that acts on virus spike proteins and receptor proteins, preventing viral entry into host cells.Inhibition of the early stages (within a few hours) of virus replication within the cells. There is apparently no (or little) effect on intracellular viruses after this time period.Inhibition of viral uncoating by reducing acidification of endosomes and lysosomes in the host cell.Inhibition of viral protein synthesis or viral protein modifications (e.g., glycosylation) inside the host cell.\n",

They found that treatment with the antimicrobials at the same time as exposure to the host cells was more effective than treatment after the viruses were inside the cells. In a study by Semple et al. (2001), chrysophanic acid (an anthraquinone) from the Australian Aboriginal medicinal plant Dianella longifolia inhibited PV-2 and PV-3 induced cytopathic effects in BGM cells.

In a study by Felipe et al. (2006), crude extracts from Guazuma ulmifolia (mutumba) and Stryphnodendron adstringens stem bark (barbatim\u00e3o) inhibited PV-1 replication in infected cells.
