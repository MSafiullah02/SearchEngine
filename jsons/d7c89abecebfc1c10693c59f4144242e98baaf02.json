The asthma and atopy in children are closely interrelated with increased T H 2-type cells, and decreased type I/II/III interferon (IFN) responses and susceptibility to RV infections. 3 Less is known about HBoV1, but HBoV1 bronchiolitis has been associated with balanced T H 1/T H 2-type response in nasopharyngeal mucosa. 4 Whether these cytokine responses reflect the immunity of the host or the species of the virus is unclear.

First, unlike RV, HBoV1 is not associated with systemic proinflammatory or T H 2-type cytokine responses during acute wheezing. Interestingly, coinfection with RV and HBoV1 resulted in a modified, non-T H 2-type cytokine response. This finding together with previous in vitro data 5 suggests that HBoV1 may interfere with RV-induced immune responses. The immunological responses were accompanied by the clinical finding that children with HBoV1 or combined RV-HBoV1 wheeze tended to develop recurrent wheezing later and less often than did those with RV wheeze. Because the severity of RV infections is known to be related to atopic status, 8 understanding the mechanism of HBoV1 infection may open new targets to tackle RV-associated undesired events such as recurrent wheeze and asthma development. 2, 9 Second, sensitized children had higher IL-4/IFN-g and lower IL-10/IL-12 ratios in consistence with atopic inflammation. These changes were similar to those reported in RV infection, 3 although we were not able to show a significant link between RV and atopy. These findings fit in a hypothesis that early T H 2-skewed inflammation exists in RV wheeze before sensitization can be detected. 2 Altogether, our findings suggest that immunological responses in acute wheezing are dependent on both host (atopy-related inflammation) and virus-specific factors and that virus-virus interaction may be of significance in modulating these responses.

Although inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of asthma treatment, children with severe asthma have decreased responsiveness to high-dose corticosteroid therapy 1 associated with airway inflammation and remodeling. 2 Given the limited efficacy of corticosteroids in severe asthma, our efforts have focused on the role of oxidative stress, namely, thiol redox disturbances, in the modulation of the disorder. 3 Indeed, we have previously demonstrated greater oxidation and decreased concentrations of the thiols cysteine and glutathione in the airways 4 and systemic circulation 5 of children with severe asthma that were further associated with increased airway inflammation and impaired cellular function. 6 Recognizing that the treatment of severe asthma might ultimately require novel approaches to restore corticosteroid sensitivity, 1 we performed metabolomic analyses of plasma samples from a highly characterized sample of children with severe asthma treated with high-dose ICS and long-acting beta agonists and children with mild-to-moderate asthma treated with ICS or ICS/long-acting beta agonist combination therapy. We report that children with severe asthma are differentiated by 2 metabolic pathways associated with oxidative stress: (1) the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway and (2) the N-acylethanolamine and N-acyltransferase pathway. These findings support the biological plausibility of oxidative stress as a contributory factor to corticosteroid insensitivity in severe asthma and potentially highlight novel therapeutic targets for further confirmation and study.
