            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus strains with the staphylococcal enterotoxin A gene (sea) bacteriophage, are a common cause of foodborne disease and outbreaks worldwide including the United States and countries of the European Union1\u20135. In Thailand, one of the largest outbreaks occurred in 2009 reporting 573 illnesses due to consumption of contaminated sticky rice custard6. S. aureus is commonly found in soil, water, air, as well as human respiratory tract and skin. The sea toxin is relatively heat stable (e.g. up to 100 \u00b0C for 30 min) therefore, food contamination generally occurs when cooking is performed without sufficient hygiene. Frequently reported contaminated foods include dairy products (milk, cheese, ice cream, etc.), and meat7,8. Importantly, contaminated food may not be easily identified by sensory evaluation such as odor or appearance. Clinical symptoms from sea food poisoning include vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and dysentery, often within 1\u20136 h after consumption. Occasional symptoms include sweating, chills, rectal bleeding, and shock9\u201311. The severity of illness depends on the concentration of the toxin. Consumption of merely 20\u2013100 ng of sea toxin can cause clinical symptoms and >100 ng may be fatal, therefore a sensitive method of sea detection is important for food safety control. Detection is usually performed using culture based on a selective Baird-Parker medium12, with a limit of <100 bacterial colony forming unit (CFU) per g or mL of food or drink13\u201315. Nonetheless, this culture method supports both the growth of sea and non-sea strains, and thus lacks specificity in detecting the pathogenic sea strains. In addition, some food ingredients can affect the ability to culture leading to false negative results.",

            "text": "An alternative method for highly specific analysis of a food-borne pathogen is the nucleic acid-based assay, which generally requires amplification prior to detection to achieve the desired sensitivity. LAMP presents an attractive alternative to traditional amplification methods like PCR due to its low cost, ease-of-use and rapidity. Most importantly, the expensive thermal cycler and specialized kits for DNA extraction and purification are not required. The strand displacement characteristic of the Bst DNA polymerase and the loop-intercalating primers allow amplification of the targets at a single temperature with high sensitivity (e.g. 10\u2013100 genome copies). The product can be visualized, albeit indirectly, by the formation of magnesium pyrophosphate as a white precipitate16. Goto et al.2. has previously developed a LAMP technique to detect sea, seb, sec and sed genes, and reported that it is more sensitive and specific than PCR by an order of magnitude2,17. However, previous analyses of LAMP results indirectly performed by monitoring the formation of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate showed limited accuracy since precipitate formation affects reading accuracy. The alternative analysis by agarose gel-electrophoresis requires electrophoresis instrumentation, extra laboratory time (0.5\u20131.5 h), safety issues due to exposure to high voltage and ethidium bromide, and perhaps false positives due to misamplification18. Here, we present the use of a nanogold-appended sea probe (AuNP) specific for the target DNA to eliminate false positives, and increase assay specificity19\u201324. The high molar extinction coefficient of the AuNP supports simple visualization by naked eyes. Together, we designed new LAMP primers based on additional sea sequences from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/) along with two inner loop primers that can speed up the amplification by parallel-amplifying DNA loops outward on both ends25 and determined the optimal reaction conditions. The LAMP-AuNP assay was validated by testing commonly contaminated food samples (ground pork and milk) to show improved specificity and sensitivity26\u201328 compared to the standard nucleic acid-based assay (PCR). We also demonstrated that the combination of a simple crude DNA lysis method and LAMP is appropriate for point-of-care and resource-restrained diagnostics. Further, since the visual reading from LAMP-AuNP cannot quantitate the number of bacterial CFU (or copy), which is important when the contamination level is below the food and drink safety control (<100 CFU) but which the hypersensitive LAMP can detect26,29, an alternative detection method employing a cationic styryl dye (STR) as a fluorescent DNA stain30,31 was developed for quantifying the LAMP product. The LAMP-STR can quantify sea levels below 100 CFU, which a conventional culture method could not detect. Our two methods, therefore, help improve early detection of contaminated meat and dairy products to mitigate outbreaks of food poisoning.",

The LAMP reaction (15 \u00b5L) comprised 1.6 \u00b5M each of primers FIP, BIP, LF and LB, 0.2 \u00b5M primers F3 and B3, 1.4 mM dNTP (SibEnzyme Ltd., Novosibirsk, Russia), 0.3 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 6 mM MgSO4, 8 U Bst DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., MA, USA), 1\u00d7 ThermoPolTM Reaction Buffer (New England Biolabs Inc.), and 100 ng DNA (unless specified). The reaction conditions (shortest incubation time with highest sensitivity and correct specificity) were optimized using incubation temperatures of 60, 63 and 65 \u00b0C, and incubation periods of 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. Heating at 80 \u00b0C for 2 min was used to terminate the reaction. The LAMP products appeared as intercalating bands of various bp sizes by 1.75% agarose gel electrophoresis.",

Gold nanoparticles of 20 nm in diameter (Sigma-Aldrich) were appended to the Probe-Sa_SEA following methods of Jaroenram et al.23 and Somboonna et al.22. In brief, 50 \u00b5L of the Probe-Sa_SEA and 10 mL of gold nanoparticles were hybridized at 150 rpm at 50 \u00b0C in a hybridization oven (Thermo Scientific, New Jersey, USA), for 22 h. Next, 1 mL of 100 mM PBS, 10 \u00b5L of 10% SDS and 500 \u00b5L of 2 M NaCl, at 50 \u00b0C, were added, and the mixture was hybridized at 150 rpm at 50 \u00b0C for another 4 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The clear solution was removed, and the precipitate was resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (100 mM NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) SDS), and centrifuged again. The pellet was finally resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (100 mM NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) SDS) to give the gold nanoparticles-probe solution (AuNP) an absorbance of 0.3\u20130.4 at 525 nm, and was stored protected from light at 4 \u00b0C. To determine the optimal conditions for the colorimetric LAMP-AuNP reaction, mixtures with different volume ratios of LAMP:AuNP (1:9 to 9:1) (10 \u03bcL total volume) were incubated at 63 \u00b0C for 10 min, and 0.01\u20131 M MgSO4 was then added. When a sufficient concentration of Mg2+ was present in the absence of the LAMP product, the AuNP agglomerated and changed its color. However, the positive LAMP products hybridize with the AuNP via their specific complementary strands, and the agglomeration induced by the salt addition was inhibited20,22,24. The LAMP-AuNP results could be interpreted by naked eyes via their color: red/purple (positive) or clear/very light purple (negative), which could be further confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry. Controls included AuNP only, AuNP with MgSO4, and no template control (DNA was replaced by ddH2O). The AuNP only displayed the same color as the positive LAMP results, while the AuNP with salt and no template control with salt showed the same color as the negative LAMP results. All controls showed the expected colors for all tests (data not shown).",

Our LAMP primers showed LAMP products as early as 15 min at 60, 63 and 65 \u00b0C incubations. Meanwhile, Goto et al.\u2019s LAMP primers earliest observable amplification was shown at 30 min (Supplemental Fig. 1). Noted without inner loop primers, both Goto et al.\u2019s and our LAMPs showed the same optimal isothermal condition at 30 min and 65 \u00b0C (data not shown). The tentative isothermal conditions (15 min, and 60, 63 or 65 \u00b0C for our LAMP; 30 min, and 60, 63 or 65 \u00b0C for Goto et al.\u2019s LAMP) were further selected based on specificity and sensitivity evaluations.

All methods could correctly identify positive (PCR product appeared as a single band at ~120 bp, LAMP product appeared as multiple bands of different sizes) and negative control strains (showed no bands) (data not shown). This confirms the BLASTN results that our LAMP primer sequences were specific to only S. aureus sea (see Materials and Methods, details on the primer design requirement). For sensitivity determination, a 10-fold serial dilution containing 9.7 ng to 0.97 fg of S. aureus ATCC13565 genome served as templates. We selected 30 min at 63 \u00b0C as the isothermal condition for Goto et al.\u2019s LAMP, and 15 min at 63 \u00b0C for our LAMP since these conditions require the smallest amount of template for successful amplification in each case. Hence, the detection limit of sea PCR and Goto et al.\u2019s LAMP were found to be 0.097 pg (32 sea copies) while our LAMP was 9.7 fg (Fig. 1). The limit of detection results suggested a 10-fold increase in sensitivity for our LAMP compared to both PCR and Goto et al.\u2019s LAMP. Proper specificity was found for all methods (Fig. 2).",

The LAMP products corresponding to positive and negative samples were mixed with the AuNP probe at different ratios from 1:9 to 9:1 (vol./vol., total volume = 10 \u00b5L), and different amounts of salt (MgSO4); and the appropriate condition was selected where a significant color difference between positive (red/purple) and negative (clear/very light purple) could be clearly observed by the naked eye within 1\u20132 min. The optimal condition was found to be 5:5 of LAMP:AuNP (vol./vol., 5 \u00b5L/5 \u00b5L) and 5 \u00b5L of 0.5 M MgSO4. Noted that other ratios also caused the color change, but at a slower rate (up to 10 min), for examples the 3:7 and 4:6 LAMP:AuNP (vol./vol) (Supplemental Fig. 2). At a 1:9 ratio of LAMP:AuNP, the LAMP product was not present in sufficient amounts to inhibit the aggregation of the AuNP probe, while at too high amounts of the LAMP product (e.g. at 8:2 or 9:1), the color of the AuNP probe was difficult to observe. Hence, the ratio of 5:5 was most appropriate for the optimal detection since both positive and negative results could be judged relatively quickly within 1\u20132 min. The color difference as observed by the naked eye was confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry (wavelength scanning from 400 nm to 700 nm): positive peak at ~530 nm corresponded to red-purple color and negative results were observed as no peak (clear) or very minor peak (very light purple) (Supplemental Fig. 2, at 5:5 LAMP-to-AuNP). The appropriate LAMP:AuNP condition was used to evaluate specificity and sensitivity. Fourteen bacterial strains, in Supplemental Table 1, served as control for specificity evaluation, and our LAMP-AuNP correctly identified the positive and negative controls (Fig. 3A). In term of sensitivity, the LAMP-AuNP results as determined by the naked eye were fully consistent with our LAMP results as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, showing a limit of detection as low as 9.7 fg, or equivalent to 3.2 sea copies (Figs. 1C and 3B).

In the crude DNA lysis, we compared different lysis buffer (TE Buffer34, 0.25 N NaCl and 0.0125% SDS38, and 1% Triton X-10036) from a minimum of three independent experiments and found that 1% Triton X-100 gave the highest DNA yield as determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The average yield of crude DNA extracted by TE buffer, 0.25 N NaCl and 0.0125% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100 was 1.34, 1.68 and 1.99 ng/\u00b5L, respectively. Therefore 1% Triton X-100 was used for the preparation of the crude DNA lysates. Live cultures of individual bacterial strains in Supplemental Table 1 were used to spike ground pork at 105 CFU/g and milk at 105 CFU/mL, and our crude DNA lysis coupled with LAMP-AuNP assay was evaluated for specificity in comparison to the culture method due to its wide use and acceptance as an ISO/IEC 17025 standard assay for S. aureus diagnostics in local settings in Thailand. Our method correctly identified positive and negative results for S. aureus sea, while the culture method showed positive results for all S. aureus sea and non-sea strains (Table 1). For sensitivity evaluation, ground pork and milk with 10\u2013105 CFU/g and CFU/mL of S. aureus (sea) were tested. The culture method could detect as low as 104 CFU/g whereas our assay could detect as low as 10 CFU/g of sea in ground pork samples. For milk samples, both the culture and our assays could detect as low as 10 CFU/mL (Table 2). Here, food matrices affected the limit of detection to culture S. aureus. It should be noted that there were differences in the sample preparation for the two assays. To maintain the bacterial viability in culture, the sample preparation method for culture is simply a mixing step between ground pork and ddH2O to obtain a liquid suspension without the use of harsh reagents or heat, so that live S. aureus could remain in pork debris. On the other hand, the crude DNA lysate preparation for LAMP required a mild detergent (Triton X-100) and boiling.",

Small amounts of contamination may be present (e.g. <100 CFU), which could be a borderline case and can be acceptable under certain circumstances. However, a highly sensitive method that is qualitative in nature would simply indicate that such a sample is positive. Hence, there is a need for a method that allows quantitation of small amounts of DNA. In this context, we developed a new cationic fluorescent styryl dye (STR) (Fig. 4A) that can brighten up in the presence of DNA. Such dyes can be used in combination with the developed LAMP method to detect and quantitate low levels of LAMP product. Several styryl dyes were screened (data not shown), and only the cationic benzothiazolium dye designated as STR (see synthesis details in Supplementary Information39) was identified as the most appropriate dye that responded to the presence of LAMP product by showing bright orange fluorescence when visualized under UV light. At 5 \u00b5M of STR and 80-fold dilution of the LAMP product (Fig. 4B), the assay can correctly identify the S. aureus sea from negative controls (non-template and E. coli). Moreover, a different level of color intensity was observed at different amounts of the DNA template, suggesting the possibilities of performing a semi-quantitative analysis. A minimum of 5 independent experiments each containing 0, 10, 100 and 1,000 CFU LAMP products were thus analyzed and the linear calibration plot between the fluorescent intensity (Y variable) and the log CFU (X variable) was obtained (Fig. 5A). To confirm our derived quantitative equation, the live S. aureus (sea) culture (10, 100 and 1,000 CFU), the genomic DNA at the limit of detection of the LAMP-AuNP method (9.7 fg, or 3.2 copies), and the negative LAMP by the negative control strains or no template were evaluated. Our LAMP-STR was able to quantitate 10\u20131,000 CFU of S. aureus (sea), and for 3.2 copies LAMP the color intensity was found to be too small to be differentiated from the background density (Fig. 5B).",

Staphylococcal enterotoxin A contamination is prevalent in meats, milk, eggs and foods high in fat. Conventional methods of detection involve culturing on selective Baird-Parker agar, in which S. aureus colonies should appear shiny black and circular surrounded by clear zone. S. aureus confirmation may be optionally performed by four biochemical tests (catalase, oxidase, coagulase and mannitol salt tests). Yet the culture method cannot differentiate sea from non-sea strains. This method is also labor and time intensive (2\u20134 days), expensive (>10 USD per test), and the sensitivity and specificity are limited compared to the DNA-based diagnostic. In DNA diagnostics, although PCR gives excellent performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, the major limitation is its requirement of an expensive thermal cycler and a 3\u20134 h diagnostic time. This study developed a combined crude DNA lysis as a means for sample preparation with S. aureus sea LAMP-AuNP and LAMP-STR that offers similar, but accelerated (<1 h) performance compared to PCR, and required no thermal cycler or electrophoresis instruments. LAMP offers a simple, rapid and effective targeted amplification, while AuNP (visual color) and STR (fluorescent) offer easy color readouts.",

This increased the amount of LAMP product, so the assay time was reduced by half from 30 to 15 min compared to Goto et al.\u2019s LAMP (and our LAMP without inner loop primers, data not shown). The limit of detection according to gel electrophoresis was also higher20,23,24 (from 97 fg to 9.7 fg genome, or equivalent 3.2 sea copies). To enable point-of-care and resource-constrained diagnosis, AuNP functionalized with a probe complementary to the LAMP product was employed to replace the agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the specific LAMP products. This allows naked eye detection with high accuracy due to complementary binding between the target (in LAMP product) and the probe41,42. Moreover, since the Bst DNA polymerase used in LAMP is much less sensitive to inhibitions than the Taq DNA polymerase typically employed in PCR, the sample preparation can be greatly simplified. The crude DNA lysis from real food samples, which often contain inhibitors to the culturing or the Taq DNA polymerase in PCR17,38,43,44, was successfully employed. This study selected ground pork and milk as food samples, given that ground pork often had problems with the culture method, and both ground pork and milk required commercial DNA extraction kits for the PCR method. While the efficiency of the culture method was biased to sample types (poor limit of detection and assay accuracy for ground pork samples), our crude DNA lysis coupled with LAMP-AuNP showed a better limit of detection and a much higher assay accuracy for both ground pork and milk samples (10 CFU/g or mL, and 97.5\u2013100% accuracy). Our assay accuracy was comparable to using commercial DNA extraction kit together with the PCR methods. Despite the fact that enterotoxin A accounts >50% of causes in some areas, the ability to detect every enterotoxin type gene that causes food poisoning is important. With appropriate primers and reaction conditions, our assay can be adapted for detecting and quantitating other enterotoxin type genes even with a minimal contamination.",

Only a simple heat block or water bath and readily available reagents are sufficient to perform our hypersensitive and highly accurate diagnostic test at a point-of-care setting in less than 1 h (30 min crude sample lysis, 15 min LAMP, and 7 min AuNP steps) while requiring minimal expertise. Our assay was effective with various types of samples including DNA, live bacterial culture, pork and milk spiked with live bacterial culture, and throughout a statistical number of market sample surveillance (Thai petty patent no. 16030012151 for LAMP-AuNP). An additional assay, LAMP-STR, was developed to quantitate low levels of S. aureus sea contamination between 10\u20131,000 CFU (Thai petty patent no. 1703000138). This facilitates the case when <100 CFU/g or mL diet is acceptable, therefore LAMP-STR will allow proper management of diets with contamination but under the control standard.",
