            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is enzootic in virtually all multiple cat populations that involve either kitten production or housing (Pedersen, 2014). Eighty percent of FIP cases occur in cats younger than two years and 50% in kittens under 7 months of age (Worthing et al., 2012). The FIP virus (FIPV) is a result of a series of unique and common internally occurring mutations in the ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Pedersen, 2014, Pedersen et al., 2008). FIP cases almost always occur as mini-enzootics, with the incidence in some catteries varying from 0 to 10% over five years (Foley et al., 1997). Shelters suffer a similar pattern of disease. This variability in incidence reflects a complex web of potential risk factors. The strongest risk factors are: (1) severity of exposure to feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Foley et al., 1997); (2) the likelihood that FECV will undergo specific mutations that alter tropism from enterocytes to peritoneal macrophages (Pedersen, 2014); (3) maternal immunity to FECV infection (Pedersen et al., 2008); (4) the age at which a cat is confronted with FIPV (Pedersen et al., 2014); (5) the type of environment, husbandry procedures, and exposure to other infectious agents (Foley et al., 1997, Pedersen et al., 1977, Pedersen et al., 2004, Poland et al., 1996), and (6) heritable predisposition (Foley et al., 1997, Golovko et al., 2013).",

Pedigreed cats are more likely to develop FIP than random-bred cats and certain breeds are also more severely affected than others (Bell et al., 2006, Norris et al., 2012, Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006, Worthing et al., 2012). Heritability accounted for 50% of the incidence among Persian catteries that were studied over a five year period (Foley et al., 1997). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) confirmed that genetic susceptibility to FIP in Birman cats was highly polymorphic and genetic associations varied depending on the age of cats tested (Golovko et al., 2013). A recent study also found that 36% of laboratory cats from a specific breeding colony were also naturally resistant to FIPV infection, although GWAS was again unable to identify strong genetic associations (Pedersen et al., 2014).",

Because of difficulties in collecting sufficient DNA samples from the field, a decision was made to enhance the likelihood of identifying FIP protective genotypes by inbreeding FIPV resistant cats resulting from previous laboratory studies. Although immunity to infectious diseases in humans is polygenic, specific polymorphisms associated with risk have been identified for a number of important infections (Chapman and Hill, 2012). The basic premise was that if resistance traits were of limited number and of sufficient strength that it should be possible to concentrate these genotypes by positive selection, making it easier to define them by GWAS or whole genome sequencing. The expectation was that inbreeding FIPV resistant cats would further decrease mortality in their kittens.",

Table 2\nprovides a genetic assessment of the P, F1 and F1/P backcross populations based on a panel of 42 STR loci. The average alleles/locus (Aa) and the average effective alleles/locus (Ae) remained the same in the P and F1 cats, but decreased in the F1/P backcrosses. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) decreased from the P to F1/P generations, reflecting the inbreeding.

The effect of lost heterozygosity can be best explained by models of autoimmune and infectious diseases in humans (Barreiro and Quintana-Murci, 2010, Goris and Liston, 2012). These models implicate numerous genetic polymorphisms within the MHC and other parts of the genome. Each polymorphism contributes small degrees of genetic risk or protection against disease that is often below the level of detectability by GWAS, and with no single risk factor being essential. A number of different polymorphisms may also lead to the same clinical outcome. In this scenario, a loss of genetic diversity could actually decrease the number of resistance-associated options available to the host.",

Unfortunately, no one has directly studied the relationship between FIP incidence and inbreeding, although a number of cat breeds are known to be highly inbred (Lyons et al., 2008) and some breeds appear to be more susceptible to FIP than others (Bell et al., 2006, Norris et al., 2012, Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006, Worthing et al., 2012). The use of certain sires has been linked to a higher incidence of FIP among their offspring (Foley and Pedersen, 1996), not because the susceptibility traits are carried only in toms, but because a single tom produces far more offspring than a single queen. Multiple cases of FIP within the same litter are frequently observed. Therefore, the results of this study confirm both the genetic complexity of FIPV resistance and the widely recommended practice of avoiding the use of cats with progeny dying of FIP for breeding programs in pedigreed catteries.",
