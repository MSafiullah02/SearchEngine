Immunodiffusion data suggested the sequential development of IgM, in supernatants obtained on days four and seven, and the simultaneous appearance of IgG and IgA in splenic and MLN-derived lymphocytes on days 7, 11, and 14. Qualitatively, splenic and MLN-derived lymphocytes were equally responsive to secondary in vitro immunization in the synthesis of all antibody classes. We next wished to quantitate the IgA produced in vitro. Culture supernatants of lymphocytes immunized with 0.5 pg TGEV protein were fractionated by HPLC size exclusion and the location of the IgA dimer was determined by RIA using '*'I-labeled goat anti-porcine IgA. The IgA fraction of the MLN-derived lymphocyte cultures neutralized TGEV to higher titers than the same fraction obtained from splenic cultures.In this report we describe the conditions whereby porcine immunoglobulins are produced in lymphoid cell cultures secondarily immunized with TGEV. In general, MLN-derived lymphocytes were superior to splenic lymphocytes in the production of IgGand IgA-neutralizing antibodies. Assessment of the immune response in virro may be adapted to (1) evaluating the interaction of suppressor and helper T lymphocytes and macrophages as mediators of the immune response and (2) screening microgram quantities of TGEV immunogenic subunits and adjuvants to maximize the immune response before extensive livestock trials.",
