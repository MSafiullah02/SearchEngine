Our objective is to utilise metaphor to instigate critical reflection about the nature of social media use behaviour and the role of habitual social media use in our experiences of reality. The first metaphor, social media as a town square, draws attention to the centrality of social media platforms in their users' lives, fear of missing out, augmented reality and digital dualism. Through the second metaphor, social media as a beauty pageant, we explore self-presentation or image crafting, social comparison and selfevaluation. The third metaphor, social media as a parliament, emphasises the role of social media platforms as spaces for online deliberation and we consider social media capital, homophily and polarisation as themes. Finally, we explore anonymity, deindividuation and deceptive self-presentation through our fourth metaphor, social media as a masquerade ball. We argue that social media scholars can use these and other metaphors to enhance communication of their research findings. Additionally, we believe that social media metaphors can be powerful pedagogical and communication tools, particularly when working with students for whom high levels of social media use is the norm.",

On a superficial level this agency is reflected in both the number of users on social media platforms and in the amount of time users spend on these platforms. However, the true impact of these technologies is perhaps most apparent in the way high levels of social media use have become enmeshed in our daily routines and, by extension, our ongoing experiences of reality. Obvious testament of the centrality that social media now occupy in our lives is the important role platforms like Facebook played in recent elections/referendums in the US and UK.",

In this paper we turn to metaphor as a means to counter this desensitisation and obtain a degree of objectivity about the underlying logic of social media use. As a linguistic and conceptual tool, metaphor has served, across the ages, as a powerful instigator of critical thinking in multiple domains [15] . Its value was emphasised by Aristotle who described its command as the mark of genius [15] and, in recent times, a substantial body of theoretical work and psychological studies directed at the process of metaphor comprehension has emerged [15, p. 641 ]. Franke [9] , accordingly, argues that, in recent decades, the \"fortunes of metaphor have revived and flourished in tandem with those of rhetoric as a whole\". Central to this revival is a renewed appreciation of the important role of metaphor in human cognition.",

Our objective, similarly, is to explore and develop understanding of social media life through the analysis of specific metaphors of social media. We aim to achieve this by mapping selected properties from a set of selected source domains to properties of particular aspects of social media logic to produce creative and rich descriptions of this logic. These descriptions, we propose, offer a vantage point from which critical reflection and analyses may be performed.",

Importantly, we do not undertake systematic analyses of metaphors as they appear in some form of qualitative data source. Such analyses answer questions concerning the discourse about and social construction of a phenomenon by a particular collective, and \"metaphors or metaphorical ideas are framed as mediators or artefacts at the social cultural level of discourse and cognition\" which influence mind and behaviour [16, p. 206 ]. Our approach, rather, is to utilise particular source domains in an attempt to clarify complex ideas about social media logic. In doing so we hope to harness the ability of metaphors to create complexities which promote reflection leading to additional questioning and the clarification of concepts [34] . Ricoeur [30] argues that \"metaphorical meaning does not merely consist of a semantic clash but of the new predicative meaning which emerges from the collapse of the literal meaning\". It is our aim to, through exploration of this new predictive meaning, advance insight into social media logic.",

When we say that social media is like a party, we selectively map properties of a source or vehicle (a party) to a target or tenor (social media) [15, p. 644 ]. The metaphor operates on the basis of preexisting similarities between source and target, enabling the mapping of systematic correspondences between the source and target domains. This mapping, Lakoff [20] notes, permits us to reason about the target phenomenon by drawing on our knowledge and experience of the source domain. He argues, on this basis, that metaphors are not merely a matter of language, but that the ontological and epistemic mapping across domains is a matter of thought and reason. Metaphors have long been appreciated for playing a pedagogical role in science, helping to \"sell new ideas by providing vivid or concrete relations and ways of representing those ideas\" which, in turn, \"sheds light on new features of an important phenomenon\" [16, p. 199] .",

When proposing a metaphor, only a specific subset of source properties are mapped to the target-those that represent likeness between source and target. For example, parties involve social interaction and this property is mappable to social media. However, parties also take place at a particular place and time, properties that are not mappable to the target. Morgan [23] , accordingly, argues that a metaphor, like any theory, is a partial, abstract truth rather than an absolute. A consequence of this principle is that a single target phenomenon can be described through the use multiple, different source domains, and vice versa. Additionally, in our analysis, we also consider differences or non-likeness between our proposed source domains and social media. It is our view that the recognition of both likeness and difference advances critical thinking about the target (i.e., social media logic).",

Beyond this paper our primary area of interest concerns social media use patterns and, in particular, the effects of social media use for mental well-being. In discussions, seminars and lectures we have often found ourselves utilising metaphors informally to describe particular dimensions of social media logic. A growing appreciation of the communicative and pedagogical value of these metaphors encouraged us to develop a list of source domains that we have found to resonate with students and/or other audiences. The four metaphors we describe here were selected from that list and were chosen due to their emphases on different themes or discourses that are prominent in contemporary research on social media.",

When someone states that they are on Twitter or that they left Instagram, the metaphor is invoked. The primary purpose of the Town Square metaphor, accordingly, is to frame social media as somewhere one can go, be and leave, and as a location or setting where events can occur. We use as source domain the notion of a village town square, a central place where events of importance occur and which serves as a meeting point characterised by continuous social interactions. The town square, typically located in or close to the centre of the village, is easily and always accessible, mirroring the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of social media. Of course, in reality, the events that are mediated through social media occur across time space, but the medium, through its collation of content into streams, pages, groups etc., centralises the digital traces of dispersed events into a single online place. When combined in this way, the disparate digital cues become perceived as a new whole, which, in turn, gives new meaning to its parts. The event, which took place in some real location at a particular time, now exists as a digital cue (e.g., video of the event) on the platform which serves as its new location. We explore two themes through this metaphor. The first concerns the perceived pressure to be on social media and the perception that one misses out on gratifying experiences when one isn't. The second concerns the tension between digital dualism and augmented reality.",

This is well reflected in the rapid growth of platform user communities before 2010 -in 2009 Facebook was growing by a staggering five million users every week [14] . This trend solidified the belief, particularly among first-world adolescent populations, that having a social media profile is an essential dimension of one's social life [25] . The broad adoption of this belief can be ascribed to an iterative relationship between, firstly, the advancement and diversification of the affordances of social media platforms, and secondly, their increasing primacy in the dynamics of real (offline) social networks. The effect was the transformation of social media from a little known cafe mainly frequented by students to the town square. This transformation strengthened the perception that one had to be there, firstly, because everyone else is there and, secondly, to engage in the important and gratifying experiences it offers.",

Scholars have explored this theme under the banner of FoMo or fear of missing out, defined as \"pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent\" [28] . As can be expected, experiences of FoMo are associated with increased social media use [2, 28] , creating a positive feedback loop which solidifies the belief that life happens in the town square. More recently, Reinecke et al. [29] use the term \"online vigilance\" to describe \"users' permanent cognitive orientation towards online content and communication as well as their disposition to exploit these options constantly\".",

The ubiquity of mobile computing devices implies that we always have the town square in our pockets, enabling us to switch from uneventful experiences on the edge of town (i.e., being offline) to exciting and rewarding social media experiences. We can continuously be in two or more places at once. By framing social media as a physical location, the metaphor forces us to critically consider this meshing of multiple realities and its effects for identity and well-being. The argument that such switching involves the augmentation of physical reality implies that cues from the physical and digital realities are continuously related to each other and, for the individual, meshed into a single reality. It is conceivable that this premise may hold in some media use scenarios, but it is equally conceivable that there are many in which it may not.",

The volume of sensory cues experienced when moving through a bustling town square requires continuous filtering of environmental stimuli and selection of attentional targets. Within the context of social media business models, the phrase \"attention economy\" [22] is often used to emphasise the primacy of controlling users' attentional allocation in achieving growth. This has cultivated interest in the science of persuasive design techniques focused on increasing both the frequency and duration of social media use, the principles of which are effectively applied on social media platforms. Much like those moving through the town square are confronted with attention seeking traders and artists, social media platforms employ various techniques in an attempt to manipulate users' attentional allocation decisions. The increase in time spent on social media platforms indicates that these techniques have been particularly effective, prompting researchers to investigate the nature and consequences of problematic social media use, and debate the possibility of social media addiction [1] .",

Users of social media platforms, in a comparable way, present themselves to an audience (e.g., their connections). These presentations include, on a basic level, the creation and maintenance of a profile, but the affordances of social media platforms enable users to compete using \"several techniques to optimise their self-presentation and promote desired relationships\", including carefully edited messages and selected images, highlighting positive attributes, presenting an ideal self, deep self-disclosure, and association with certain people or material objects [4, p. 117 ]. The beauty pageant metaphor prompts us to consider these actions as carefully planned attempts to impress other users who are perceived to be continually judging their network. Moreover, it makes explicit the existence of a competitive dimension in social media use, emphasising, by extension, the notion that there are winners and losers. These ideas have received ample attention from scholars investigating the subjective and social underpinnings of self presentation or image crafting by social media users. Narcissism has, for instance, been associated with higher levels of social activity on social media platforms and the creation of more self-promoting content [3] . Halpern et al. [13] found that the online sharing of flattering images of oneself creates the perception, for the sharer, of an online ideal persona that diverges from real-life self-perception.",

In this regard the metaphor draws our attention to the processes of deliberation within social media communities, and the interplay between deliberation, user behaviour and community structures. On many social media platforms users, like parliamentarians, do not address a particular target but rather the community as a whole. Community members are then free to respond to the content, creating a thread of deliberation. In addition to liking or retweeting the statement presented, affordances enable engagement through responses, counter-arguments or supportive comments. These forms of feedback enable the community to gauge the degree of support for particular viewpoints and determine the alignment between their personal views and those of other members.

Gayo-Avello [10] argues that while social media users have \"a certain degree of exposure to cross-cutting ideas (even to users who are clearly partisans) and can interact with users who have opposing ideas\", they mostly avoid such discussions. Additionally, his research suggests that when users encounter arguments that are in conflict with their views, they do not propagate them within their networks. This theme has primarily been explored in the context of political polarisation where a key concern is the manner in which online deliberation reinforces preexisting views by perpetuating a confirmation bias [5] . However, contrary findings have also been reported. For example, Semaan et al.

            "text": "While image crafting, as a dimension of the beauty pageant metaphor, draws attention to how users emphasise or highlight aspects of their identities, the masquerade ball draws our attention to the manner in which image crafting also involves obscuring of identity aspects. In this way the two metaphors describe how the same outcome (i.e., desired self-presentation) can be achieved through different strategies (i.e., accentuating vs obscuring). The masks worn at masquerade balls may not fully obscure the person, but be carefully chosen to hide particular physical features. We argue, accordingly, that social media users carefully utilise affordances, like masks, to find an optimal balance between disclosure and anonymity based on their goals and the nature of the social media space. Guadagno et al. [11] use the phrase \"deceptive self-presentation\" to describe such behaviour and argue that \"it increases as a function of the pressure to engage in self-presentation\" [11, p. 642 ]. Alternatively, users may wish to disclose personal information but avoid identifiability. For example, users of online dating platforms may, due to the stigma traditionally associated with the practice [7] , obscure information making them identifiable, but disclose aspects like physical appearance to attract attention to their profiles. It is our view that these and other forms of masquerading have become salient features of social media logic, with broad adoption serving to obscure their novelty and significance. The metaphor brings them to the fore and invites critical reflection about their enactment and effects.",

For such individuals the dynamics of behaviour and network formation on social media may be so embedded in their understanding of social interaction in general that they may altogether disregard the agency of the technical affordances of social media platforms in their behaviour. Metaphors of non-mediated social spaces will enable educators to draw students' attention to the role of these affordances in shaping mediated socialisation patterns and the extent to which they determine behavioural norms on social media platforms.",

For example, one may argue that none of our metaphors adequately addresses underlying business models of social media platforms, and how these models drive, firstly, the development of affordances and, secondly, user behaviour. Other prominent themes which are not explicitly addressed include cyberbullying, marketing through influencers and compulsive or problematic social media use. To address these and other themes, future work in this area can consider metaphors in relation to the seven functional blocks of social media as proposed by Kietzmann et al. [18] .",
