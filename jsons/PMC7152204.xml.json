Although it has been known since ancient times, it became familiar to the Greeks and Romans during the Middle Ages, before that bismuth was often confused with other metals, such as lead and tin. It is considered to be a metal in the periodic table but has more similarity to semimetals. Bismuth is categorized among the group of elements conventionally known as \u201cpoor elements\u201d due to its rarity. It has been used quite extensively for various purposes including cosmetic, industrial, laboratory, and pharmaceutical. Bismuth serves as a leading nontoxic replacement for lead in brass plumbing fixtures, fishing sinkers, free machining steels, and solders, as well as a metallurgical additive in the foundry. The manufacture applications of bismuth also include ceramic glazes, pearlescent pigments, lubricating greases, and crystal ware.",

Substitution of the formerly widely used lead-based EP additives by bismuth-sulfur additives not only provides a higher lubricant efficacy, but also reduces the amount of heavy metal used in extreme-pressure lubricants by a half, in accordance with the new ecological and environmental philosophy of the world. In recent decades, the substitution of lead with bismuth in glass production may lead to potential application for bismuth in the manufacturing of automobile glass, the finest tableware, and art objects, with the purpose of environmental protection. In North America, Bi\u2014Sn has been used to replace lead in shotshells for the hunting of wetland birds. Although the bismuth-containing shotshells cannot be approved as \u201cnontoxic,\u201d in comparison to the high toxicity of lead (e.g. a toxic intake level of 1 mg for a 70 kg human), the higher tolerance to bismuth among humans (e.g. a toxic intake level of 15 \u00d7 103\n mg for a 70 kg human) renders it a \u201crelatively\u201d safe substitute for preventing environmental problems caused by lead accumulation. Owing to their satiny luster and low absorption properties, some bismuth compounds such as bismuth oxychloride and bismuth vanadate have also been used in cosmetics including nail polishes, lipsticks, and eye shadows. Recently in Europe, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS-2002/95/EC) has stated that lead must be eliminated in the manufacturing of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. This restriction, which has been supported by commercial and research organizations in Japan and the North America, may further increase the demand for bismuth in industry in future, and accelerate the replacement of lead and other heavy metals with bismuth in the manufacturing industry.",

The massive usage of bismuth compounds for the treatment of syphilis and wound infections in early 20th century was dramatically dropped owing to the discovery of antibiotics, thus, contemporary use of bismuth in medicine principally lies in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as gastric and duodenal ulcers (e.g. colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), bismuth subsalicylate, and bismuth subnitrate), dyspepsia (bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth subnitrate, etc.), and diarrhea (bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth nitrate, etc.).",

The therapeutic efficacy of bismuth citrate-based drugs against the H. pylori-associated infections may be attributed to (1) preferential formation of a \u201cprotective coating\u201d on the ulcer craters owing to the fact that CBS can form polymeric structures (Fig. 3\n); (2) induction of the secretion of increasing mucosal protective factors; (3) antimicrobial activity of Bi(III), which is attributable to its ability to disrupt multiple biological pathways via binding to key proteins andenzymes. Ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC, Tritec and Pylorid, GlaxoSmithKline plc.) was later found to be a more efficient antiulcer agent, since it incorporates an H2-receptor antagonist, ranitidine, to suppress secretion of excess stomach acid.",

Since nanotechnology has been extensively explored, bismuth-based nanomaterials have also received more attention in pharmaceuticals.

Thus, the anti-H. pylori actions of bismuth drugs are resulted from comprehensive factors including but not limited to, hindrance of synthesis of bacterial cell wall, impediment of bacterial adhesion, inhibition of ATP synthesis, abolishment of defense of oxidative stress and pH buffering ability, interference of metal homeostasis (e.g. Ni2 + homeostasis), inhibition of activity of key enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, urease, DnaK. A recent report showed that bismuth inhibits urease activity by disruption of the cellular maturation of urease via functional perturbation of one of its accessory proteins, UreG, rather than directly targets the metal center of urease.

Bismuth thiolates are one of the most representative antimicrobial agents among those newly developed bismuth compounds.

These complexes show antimicrobial activity against some Gram-negative bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as some Gram-positive bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at micromolar levels. Subsequent studies show that Bi(III) thiolates exhibit remarkable anti-biofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus biofilms. Recent research indicates that the antimicrobial spectrum of bismuth thiolates could be further broadened when prepared in nanoparticle form (exemplified as BisBAL NPs). The enhanced antimicrobial potency of bismuth thiolates is possibly in part due to the chelation effect of thiols that significantly improves the solubility and lipophilicity of Bi(III) compounds, as well as the rapid exchange of those kinetically labile thiolate ligands inside bacterial cells.",

Over a long period of time, it remains a mystery that why bismuth(III) is selectively toxic to certain human pathogens rather than human beings. One possible reason is the limited gastrointestinal tract (GIT) absorption of bismuth after its oral administration. Recent studies indicated that glutathione (GSH) may play a vital role for bismuth metabolism and detoxification in mammalian cells. Bismuth ions were found to be passively absorbed, conjugated to GSH and then transported into vesicles via MRP transporter; the sequestration of absorbed bismuth consumed cytosolic glutathione and activated was in de novo biosynthesis, which in turn facilitated passive uptake of bismuth (Fig. 7\n). The self-propelled positive feedback cycle actively eliminated bismuth from both intra- and extracellular space, thus protecting critical systems of human body from acute toxicity. Considering GSH is ubiquitous in most living cells, but only absent in certain anaerobic or microanaerobic bacteria such as H. pylori, the GSH and MRP mediated self-propelled disposal of bismuth in host cells might be accountable for the selective toxicity of bismuth drugs.",

Investigations of bismuth-protein interactions will not only improve understanding of the mechanism of action of bismuth but will also provide a basis for the design of more effective bismuth agents. Bismuth was found to be binding to transferrin (an iron transport protein) preferentially to the C-lobe with carbonate (CO3\n2 \u2212) as a synergistic anion. Transferrin is likely to act as a bismuth transport \u201cvehicle,\u201d as it is only 30% saturated with iron in blood plasma. Importantly, the metal-bound transferrin can be rapidly recognized by the transferrin receptor because of the higher affinity of the receptor to metal-bound transferrin than to its apo-form (Fig. 8\n). Although human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in serum (0.63 mM) and has been hypothesized to be the target of bismuth in plasma. Around 70% bismuth associates to transferrin and the rest to increasing bismuth concentration serum albumin, indicating a higher selectivity of bismuth to transferrin.",

The bismuth-bound lactoferrin is able to compete with the iron-bound lactoferrin in both the membrane and intracellular, providing another route for bismuth transport. Histidine-rich proteins, such as Hpn and Hpn-like (46.7% and 25% histidine residues, respectively) in H. pylori are also potential targets of bismuth ions. Mutagenesis experiments have shown that H. pylori with hpn gene knock-out are fourfold susceptible to bismuth antiulcer drugs than that of the wild-type, indicating a protective role of Hpn in H. pylori responses to bismuth-based therapies. The interaction of bismuth with enzymes is related to the high affinity to cysteine residues. For example, bismuth inhibits urease activity probably by blocking the enzyme active site by coordinating to a cysteine residue at the entrance of the active site.",

            "text": "Patients suffer toxicity at different bismuth levels in blood but the syndrome is rare when bismuth levels are below 50 \u03bcg/L. Among the bismuth-based regimens, the use of insoluble bismuth compounds such as bismuth oxychloride and bismuth subcarbonate are related to low toxicity, whereas the use of soluble bismuth organic compounds such as bismuth sodium tartrate and tripotassium dicitratobismuthate, or the combined use of bismuth with thiolate-containing ligands, are associated with high toxicity, such as neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. This is probably due to the enhanced uptake of soluble bismuth salts in human bodies. It has also been suggested that the oral bismuth drugs need to undergo methylation by intestinal microbes to enable them to be absorbed. Absorbed bismuth will accumulate in the kidneys, lungs, spleen, liver, brain, and muscles, and will be eliminated in urine and feces via bile and intestinal secretions. In the clinic, depending on the administration time of bismuth, its toxicity can be roughly divided into acute and chronic exposures. Both exposure doses can cause neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and increased bismuth concentration in blood. In spite of the toxicity, most of these side effects can be alleviated after the discontinuation of bismuth therapies. Bismuth iodoform paraffin paste (BIPP), which reduces the risk of bacterial infection, renders a deep necrotic wound cavity clean and promotes the development of granulation tissue, and is widely used in oral, maxillofacial, and ENT surgery (ear, nose, and throat surgery) as an antiseptic dressing. However, a few examples of serious adverse effects of BIPP were observed in the clinic when some patients were treated with BIPP. In one case, the patient became acutely confused and the gait became unsteady, indicative of an encephalopathy caused by over-dosage of bismuth. This was confirmed by the observation of a toxic level of bismuth in the patient\u2019s serum. Another case involved using BIPP to cover the dura mater in a wound after removal of a large basal cell carcinoma. The patient became confused and then comatose. An encephalopathy was confirmed by the observation of diffuse cerebral edema in a tomographic scan. However, upon removal of the BIPP, the patient recovered, and deteriorated if the pack was applied again. The mechanism of intoxication has not been well understood till now. It was probably caused by the interference of bismuth with the oxidative metabolism of the central nervous system by binding to essential enzymes and reducing cerebral blood flow.",

After ingestion of CBS for 10 days, bismuth levels in both the blood and urine were 739 and 693 \u03bcg/L respectively. With the treatment of peritoneal dialysis, his urine volumes increased and plasma BUN and creatinine levels decreased gradually. After 100 days of admission, the patient recovered and his bismuth level in blood went back to normal.
