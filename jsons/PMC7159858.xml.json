Rhinologists from the Stanford University group have performed a valuable service by publicizing their communications with colleagues abroad and their experiences with COVID-19. There have been reports that during a transsphenoidal resection performed in China, all 14 individuals in the operating room, ranging from the surgeons to ancillary staff, contracted COVID-19 despite some of them using N95 masks and other PPE. They have posited this may be due to viral particles becoming aerosolized during epithelial disruption, and that these viral particles may stay in the surrounding air for 3 hours or longer. Similarly, COVID-19 cases were contracted following other endoscopic endonasal cases. Surgeon and staff COVID-19 infections anecdotally appear to be eliminated with the use of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs). In addition to these communications, the Stanford group suggests COVID-19 testing for all surgical patients, if possible two tests due to the prospects of a false negative especially in those groups that had previously tested positive.",

Providers can take this opportunity to triage who needs nasal endoscopy, but this requires guidelines to be developed on this for the future. In our practices, we feel that this involves several categories of patients. Patients with unilateral sinonasal symptoms warrant a repeat in-person visit after telemedicine for nasal endoscopy, as well as patients with imaging demonstrating unilateral disease. High-risk patients such as immunocompromised patients present a quandary, particularly during these COVID-19 times. These are the individuals who you would want to stay home, and that would certainly be appropriate during the initial telemedicine visit. Nonetheless, there should be a low threshold for considering nasal endoscopy on them if they are having troublesome new onset symptoms such as severe pain, fevers, and other systemic symptoms. Patients with a known tumor history need appropriate surveillance and are not amenable to simply a telemedicine visit without nasal endoscopy, however depending on the severity of the previous lesion, perhaps some of these routine surveillance visits can be performed remotely with imaging replacing endoscopy for surveillance. Finally, while many epistaxis patients can be seen remotely and instructed on conservative measures for minimizing epistaxis, this is not always possible, particularly in this day and age characterized by an expanding repertoire of blood-thinning medications.",

Aside from obvious indications for nasal endoscopy, including unilateral symptoms, immunocompromised patients, and patients in whom malignancy is suspected, failed appropriate medical treatment and complications of rhinosinusitis, telehealth offers an excellent opportunity to gather an appropriate history supporting the need for imaging as an alternative to nasal endoscopy be it in the office or radiology suite.
