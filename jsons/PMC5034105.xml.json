Questions on the pathogenesis of ZIKV's other clinical manifestations, its unique ability among flaviviruses to be transmitted trans-placentally and sexually, and its potential animal reservoirs remain mostly unanswered. Although in vivo phenomena may not be completely reproducible in the in vitro setting, cell line susceptibility studies are often useful for providing critical data for these knowledge gaps in the early phases of epidemics caused by emerging RNA viruses.14, 15 In this study, we correlated the differential cell line susceptibility, species tropism, viral replication efficiency and antigen expression patterns with the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ZIKV, and compared them with those of the closely related dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). Our findings provided novel implications on the disease pathogenesis, transmission and potential animal reservoirs that could be applied to optimize laboratory testing protocols and infection control strategies for this global health emergency.",

These included the placental (JEG-3), genitourinary (HEK, HeLa, HOSE6-3, LNCaP and 833KE), neuromuscular (SF268 and RD), retinal (ARPE19), respiratory (Hep2, Calu-3 and HFL), intestinal (Caco-2) and hepatic (Huh-7) cell lines. There was a slight increase in mean viral load of about 0.5\u20131 lgcopies/mL in the monocyte (THP-1) and B lymphocyte (Raji) cell lines (P>0.01), but none of the immune cell lines achieved a \u2a7e2 log increase in mean viral load within 5 d.p.i. The highest mean viral loads (\u2a7e10 lgcopies/mL) were observed in the placental (JEG-3), cervical (HeLa), neuronal (SF268), upper respiratory tract (Hep-2) and intestinal (Caco-2) cell lines. Twelve of these 14 cell lines (JEG-3, HEK, HeLa, LNCaP, SF268, RD, ARPE19, Hep-2, Calu-3, HFL, Caco-2 and Huh-7) showed obvious ZIKV-NS1 protein expression by IF in addition to a high viral load (Table 2).

Moreover, a comprehensive surveillance for potential animal reservoirs of ZIKV, which are likely important in facilitating the spread of the virus after 60 years of quiescence, has not been reported. A virus' ability to grow in cells of different host species might provide insight into its ability to cross interspecies barriers. We therefore conducted this systematic study to characterize the tropism of the emerging ZIKV in a broad range of human and nonhuman cell lines derived from different tissues or organs and host species.

These unique clinical features of ZIKV infection require the virus to be able to infect neural progenitor cells of the fetus in utero during early gestation. A striking difference between the cell line susceptibilities of ZIKV and DENV-2 observed in our study was ZIKV's ability to productively replicate in placental cells (JEG-3). JEG-3 cells infected with ZIKV produced high viral loads (~10 lgcopies/mL), abundant ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and prominent CPE. This finding helped to explain the unique ability of ZIKV to infect the fetus via the placenta and cause congenital anomalies, particularly when the infection occurred during the first trimester.34 Although a previous study suggested that type III interferons produced by human placental trophoblasts could confer protection against ZIKV infection, it is notable that the study utilized primary human trophoblasts of full-term instead of early gestation placenta.35 Indeed, our in vitro finding concurred with the recent reports of detectable viral particles and RNA in trophoblasts of the maternal and fetal placenta of ZIKV-infected type I interferon signaling-deficient mice and permissibility of placental macrophages and cytotrophoblasts to productive ZIKV infection.12, 36",

Probable sexual transmission of ZIKV has been reported.20, 21, 22 ZIKV-infected male patients might develop hematospermia and perineal pain compatible with prostatitis, and might have detectable viral RNA and/or infectious viral particles in their semen.20, 21, 22 In contrast to DENV-2, which did not efficiently replicate in any of the genital tract cell lines, the mean ZIKV load significantly increased in the prostatic (LNCaP) and testicular (833KE) cell lines without inducing CPE. This suggested that the prostate and testes might be important sites of ZIKV replication that led to prolonged virus shedding in the semen of infected men.20, 21, 37 Interestingly, abundant ZIKV-NS1 protein expression was detected in ZIKV-infected LNCaP cells, but not 833KE cells. This finding might imply that ZIKV could replicate more efficiently in the prostate than the testes. Recent studies only reported high viral loads in the testes of ZIKV-infected mice deficient in interferon signaling and/or receptor, but did not report the viral loads in their prostates.30, 38 Further studies should be conducted to investigate the prostate's role as a replication site of ZIKV. The female genital tract cell lines, including HeLa and HOSE6-3, were also susceptible to ZIKV, supporting the hypothesis that non-immune women might acquire the infection through sexual intercourse with their ZIKV-infected male partners.",

This helped to explain the high viral loads in the urine and nasopharyngeal swabs of ZIKV-infected patients.39, 40, 41 The finding of high viral load and abundant ZIKV-NS1 protein expression without inducing CPE in HEK cells is particularly interesting, as it suggests that the kidney might be another site of persistent ZIKV replication. Similarly, DENV-2 infection also caused increased mean viral load and DENV-2-NS1 protein expression without inducing CPE in HEK cells, and viral RNA might be detected in urine of dengue patients.42 An important implication of this finding is that kidney transplant donors in ZIKV-affected regions should be tested for the infection before organ donation, as virus shedding in urine might be prolonged.39, 40, 41 The intestinal (Caco-2) cell line was also highly susceptible to ZIKV, which corroborated with the high viral load detected in the intestines of ZIKV-infected mice.43 Serial testing of fecal samples of ZIKV-infected patients should be performed to determine whether feces represent another possible transmission route of ZIKV. It would also be interesting to investigate ZIKV's ability to productively replicate in salivary gland cells, as high viral load could also be detected in the saliva of ZIKV-infected patients.41, 44",

The finding of high viral loads and abundant ZIKV-NS1 protein expression without induction of CPE within 5 d.p.i. in the Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cell line was quite expected, and corroborated with the high non-fatal infection, dissemination and transmission rates of ZIKV in infected A. albopictus.45 A \u2a7e2 log increase in mean viral load with ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and CPE were observed in the nonhuman primate (Vero and LLC-MK2), pig (PK-15), rabbit (RK-13), hamster (BHK21) and chicken (DF-1) cell lines. It is well known that the transmission of flaviviruses may involve sylvatic cycles between the mosquito vectors and susceptible wild animals, and urban cycles between the vectors and domestic animals.46, 47 Nonhuman primates are known wild animal reservoirs of ZIKV and DENV.1, 46 Our findings of efficient ZIKV replication in pig, rabbit, hamster and chicken cell lines suggest that these mammalian or avian species might have a role in the transmission of ZIKV. Similar to domestic pigs and wild birds for JEV, and domestic and wild birds for WNV, these species may serve as the animal reservoirs or amplifying hosts of ZIKV.46 Moreover, vector-free JEV transmission due to persistence of virus in tonsils and virus shedding in oronasal secretions of pigs has recently been reported.48 Alternatively, these animal species may be susceptible hosts with less importance in the transmission cycle, which is analogous to horses for JEV and many vertebrate species for WNV.46 Systematic sampling of domestic animals in ZIKV-affected regions would help to confirm these findings. Pigs, rabbits and hamsters should be evaluated as animal models for ZIKV infection, as interferon signaling- or receptor-deficient mice are not routinely available in most laboratories. Pig and/or hamster models have been previously reported for DENV and WNV infection.49, 50",
