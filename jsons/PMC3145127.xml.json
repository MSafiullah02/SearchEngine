Only comparatively recently has there been extensive contact between peoples, flora and fauna from both old and new worlds (Diamond, 1998). The movement of disease has proved a major force in shaping world history, as wars, crusades, diasporas and migrations have carried infections to susceptible populations. Until World War II, more war victims died of microbes introduced by the enemy, than of battle wounds (Karlen, 1995). More often than not, the victors in past wars were not those armies with the best weapons and generals, but those bearing the deadliest pathogens (Zinsser, 1943;Diamond, 1998).",

With the advent of truly global travel, the last five centuries have seen more new diseases than ever before become potential pandemics (Karlen, 1995). The current reach, volume and speed of travel are unprecedented, so that human mobility has increased in high-income countries by over 1000-fold since 1800 (Wilson, 1995, Wilson, 2003). Aviation, in particular, has expanded rapidly as the world economy has grown, though worries about its potential for spreading disease began with the advent of commercial aviation (Massey, 1933). Passenger numbers have grown at nearly 9% per annum since 1960 and are expected to increase at more than 5% per annum for at least the next 10 years, with airfreight traffic showing similar changes (Upham et al., 2003). Similarly, globalization of the world economy has also resulted in a shipping traffic increase of over 27% since 1993 (Zachcial and Heideloff, 2003).",

This view, however, has recently been questioned (Scott and Duncan, 2004). The Black Death arrived in Sicily in 1347 and within two years had swept northwards to Scandinavia, at a time when rats appear to have been absent from much of Europe (Twigg, 1984, Twigg, 2003). Even if introduced at ports, rat populations could not feasibly have colonized such large areas so quickly. New examination of contemporary accounts, and local parish records, reveal patterns of death that are consistent with a directly transmitted infection among family members and neighbours, with symptoms consistent with some sort of viral haemorrhagia. The real \u2018vector\u2019 appears to have been man: occasional introductions to certain nearby towns and villages coincided with the arrival of travellers on foot or horseback (Scott and Duncan, 2004). People at the time were aware of the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine within affected households, which would not have prevented infection spread by rats and fleas. It seems that only the limited transport and movement patterns of the time prevented even greater impacts on the European human population.",

Initially originating in China, plague-infected rats were transported around the world in sailing vessels, sparking major epidemics at international ports such as Sydney, Bombay, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro (Duplaix, 1988). The limited spread inland from port cities remains a mystery, but the control of rats and modernization of housing, food storage and sanitation, have been suggested as preventing large-scale inland rat migration (Zinsser, 1943). Spread did occur from San Francisco, however, resulting in plague becoming endemic in prairie dog colonies of Western USA, causing occasional human cases even today (Markel, 2005).",

Plague is thus re-emerging as a significant public health concern. Since the last pandemic, plague's geographic range has expanded, posing new threats to previously unaffected regions (Gage and Kosoy, 2005) and resulting in hundreds of cases in at least 14 countries (World Health Organization, 2003). Although recent outbreaks have been quickly controlled limiting case numbers, resultant economic disruptions have been severe. India's 1994 outbreak resulted in just 52 deaths, but over 1 billion USD in economic costs, demonstrating how vulnerable the global economy can be to the threat of infectious diseases (Cash and Narasimhan, 2000).",

The bacterium can survive for long periods in water and is commonly transmitted by contaminated water, or food that has been washed in such water. Accounts of cholera-like diseases go back as far as the times of Hippocrates and Buddha (Reidl and Klose, 2002). Over the past 185 years, Vibrio cholerae has escaped seven times from its endemic heartland in West Bengal, India, to result in pandemics (Sack et al., 2004). It first started as an epidemic outbreak in 1817 in India, but soon started spreading, in part due to British ship and troop movements, carrying the infection north and east to China, Japan and Indonesia (Reidl and Klose, 2002). The disease also spread along trade routes to the west as far as southern Russia (Karlen, 1995). Each successive pandemic increased in extent and severity, reflecting the expanding reach of the global transport system and increased movements of people, particularly on religious pilgrimages (Rogers, 1919). The 1830s saw Russian troops, English ships, Irish immigrants and Canadian exploration carry Vibrio cholerae to the Baltic, England, Ireland, Canada, USA and Mexico (Curtin, 1995). Its arrival in Mecca in 1831 in time for the Muslim pilgrimage is thought to have sparked over 40 epidemics by 1912 (McNeill, 1976). Statistically, the impact of cholera epidemics was rarely severe, with only a small percentage of populations affected, but it developed a fearsome reputation through seemingly bypassing all attempts at quarantine and because it attacked rich as well as poor (McNeill, 1976). Not until John Snow's work on cholera clusters in London in the 1850s, and later acceptance of \u2018germ\u2019 theories of disease, did a proper understanding and effective control develop (McNeill, 1976).",

During the 20th century, influenza was the principal infectious disease to be influenced by the growing global transport network and to display pandemic behaviour.

The 1918 influenza pandemic killed around 40 million people in a year (Oxford, 2004), and resulted in an almost 10-year drop in the calculated average life expectancy of the global population (Palese, 2004). This disease is now used as a worst-case scenario for pandemic preparedness planning (Mills et al., 2004). Three influenza viruses with different haemagglutin surface proteins (H1, H2, H3) were responsible for the pandemics of the 20th century. Although it is theoretically possible to create vaccines against any new influenza virus given enough time and production capacity, the genetic instability of the virus means it can evolve quickly, thereby escaping the effects of newly developed vaccines (McNeill, 1976).",

This speed was attributable both to a haemagglutin surface protein shift from previous viruses, leaving the global population susceptible to infection; and to the availability of regular air and sea travel via which secondary epidemic sources were established (Thomas, 1992). Before it became widely epidemic in many countries, a vaccine had been developed and produced in sufficient quantities to reduce the incidence and intensity of influenza in developed countries with available vaccine, yet it still claimed over 70 000 lives in the US and many more elsewhere (Palese, 2004). In 1968, another strain was isolated in Hong Kong, and quickly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths, even though antibodies remaining from the 1957 pandemic were thought to have moderated the severity of infections (Cox and Subbarao, 2000). Epidemics continue to occur regularly (Viboud et al., 2004), as do movements of the virus through the global transportation system, causing outbreaks even on aircraft (Marsden, 2003).",

The exact origin of the HIV/AIDS virus remains unknown, but sero-archaeological studies have documented human infections with HIV prior to 1970 (Mann, 1989). Phylogenetic analysis has indicated that multiple interspecies transmissions from simians introduced two genetically distinct types of HIV into the human population: HIV-1 from chimpanzees and HIV-2 from sooty mangabeys (Lemey et al., 2003). While HIV-2 is mainly restricted to West Africa and is thought to have originated in Guinea-Bissau (Lemey et al., 2003), HIV-1 has spread globally from the first zoonotic transmission from chimpanzee to people around 70 years ago in central Africa (Jonassen et al., 1997; Russell et al., 2000; Perrin et al., 2003).",

Studies have also shown that certain groups of mobile and sexually active individuals are important in seeding local epidemics, including immigrants, intravenous drug users, tourists, truck drivers, military troops and seamen (Perrin et al., 2003; Salit et al., 2005). This is illustrated by the first documented infections in Europe, caused by a Norwegian seaman infected through heterosexual contact in a West African seaport, returning to infect his wife, who transmitted the infection to her daughter (Jonassen et al., 1997). The role of international travel in the spread of HIV was also highlighted by the case of \u2018Patient Zero\u2019, a Canadian flight attendant who travelled extensively worldwide. Analysis of several of the early AIDS cases showed that the infected individuals were the attendant's direct or indirect sexual contacts and could be traced to several different American cities, thereby demonstrating the role of international travel in spreading the virus (Karlen, 1995).",

The disease's spread can be linked to a variety of factors. In the United States, the rapid spread of AIDS between 1984 and 1990 can be modelled accurately using air traffic flows between cities (Gould, 1995, Gould, 1999). The non-homogenous distribution of the global pandemic both between and within countries reflects levels of social vulnerability and mobility (Bronfman et al., 2002). Infection rates are usually higher in urban areas; rural areas, especially in Africa, are affected by the levels of mobility and migration which enable the virus to shift from urban to rural centres, and tend to mean that infection rates are higher near main roads and in trading centres than in isolated villages (Lagarde et al., 2003).",

It also demonstrated how a new and poorly understood disease, with no vaccine and no effective cure, can adversely affect economic growth, trade, tourism and social stability, especially when its perceived risk is many times higher than its actual risk (Heymann, 2004). The economic impact of SARS has been estimated at between US$30\u2013140 billion (Skowronski et al., 2005), largely as a consequence of reduced travel and investment in Asia. SARS also showed how inadequate surveillance and response capacity in a single country can have an impact upon global public health security (Heymann, 2004). While the pandemic ended in late 2003, the fact that three years later there is no vaccine and that the animal reservoir of the disease remains to be identified conclusively (though civet cats are thought to be the source; Song et al., 2005), means a return of SARS cannot be ruled out (Skowronski et al., 2005).",

As a weapon, it would most likely be delivered by aerosol as seen in 2001 in the US Postal Service attacks (Dewan et al., 2002; Greene et al., 2002) and, consequently, acquired by inhalation. Without rapid treatment, death may occur in as many as 95% of cases (Cieslak and Eitzen, 1999). Although a licensed vaccine and efficient therapy exists, the short incubation period and rapid progression of the disease means identification and treatment of any exposed populations is likely to present a major challenge.",

It has played a major part in shaping human history, repeatedly killing millions in Europe in epidemics throughout the 16th century before immunity arose to reduce its severity (Alibek, 2004). Europeans then inadvertently introduced smallpox to the New World, where it aided in wiping out whole ancient civilizations that had no immunity (McNeill, 1976; Karlen, 1995). Aggressive global vaccination programmes led to the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox in 1977. The consequent halt to routine vaccination means that today the world's population again has little immunity to the disease (Lane et al., 2001). Smallpox's case mortality rate of around 30% and its high transmissibility make it a potentially potent bioweapon and although officially just two samples exist, the existence of other sources, particularly from the 1970s Soviet research programme, cannot be ruled out (Lane et al., 2001). In the face of such a possible threat, funding of research examining the scale of possible casualties and optimal control strategies has been increased massively, and various high-profile modelling studies have been undertaken (Meltzer et al., 2001; Halloran et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2002; Bozzette, 2003; Ferguson et al., 2003b; Grais et al., 2003b).

The growth and movement of an epidemic or pandemic is governed principally by the number of secondary cases generated by an initial or primary case in an entirely susceptible population (the reproductive number of the disease, R0), and the average time taken for the secondary cases to be infected by a primary case (Bailey, 1967; Anderson and May, 1991). Splitting modelled populations into susceptible, infected and recovered categories forms the basis of much epidemic and pandemic modelling and has provided qualitative insights into the epidemiology of a wide range of pathogens. To obtain quantitative predictions for risk assessment and policy formulation, however, refinement of such basic concepts is required to account for complex biological and behavioural factors, including the variation of infectiveness and susceptibility within a population, and the mixing, movement and socio-economic structure of the population at risk (Ferguson et al., 2003b).",

Such an approach was demonstrated by Rvachev and Longini (1985) who showed the diffusion of the 1968\u20131969 influenza pandemic to be predictable through a model based on the air travel network of the time. Incidence data from the pandemic origin, Hong Kong, were used to estimate model parameters, such as contact level between susceptible and infectious individuals, time taken in latent and infectious states and the fraction of people susceptible to the virus. Annual average daily air passenger numbers between 52 cities were then used to derive probabilities of travel between the cities. Finally, the seasonality of influenza was taken into account by applying a scaling factor to northern and southern hemisphere city contact level parameters to mimic the hemispheric swing of influenza epidemics. This model was later updated and refined to provide the basis for predictive models of the spread of influenza, smallpox, SARS and other infectious agents through the global transportation network (Longini et al., 1986; Dye and Gay, 2003; Grais et al., 2003a, Grais et al., 2003b; Vogel, 2003; Hufnagel et al., 2004).",

Modelling can, however, identify possible efficient interventions from a range of available scenarios, taking into account the range of uncertainties of key epidemiological parameters (Ferguson et al., 2003b). Models can also find use during actual outbreaks, as was shown in the real-time statistical modelling of the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth epidemic (Ferguson et al., 2001; Keeling et al., 2003). Haggett (2000) outlines a number of important points relevant to the future control of epidemics and pandemics: (i) pandemic control will rely less and less on conventional spatial barriers as the global transport network continues to expand, (ii) the speed of modern transport means prompt surveillance and rapid reporting now play a critical role in preventing the spatial spread of a disease, (iii) mathematical models will become central in identifying aberrant behaviour in disease trends and (iv) the high cost of surveillance makes sampling design and the development of cost-effective monitoring and testing approaches vital to effective epidemic early warning systems.",

Though the mosquito is now established throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, it was located solely in West Africa until the 15th century (Lounibos, 2002). At some point, the insect adapted to anthropogenic breeding sites, such as water storage jars in ships (Lounibos, 2002). This ability enabled it to take full advantage of the growing slave trade from West Africa to reach the new world or to invade Portugal and Spain before its proliferation elsewhere on European ships. Ae. aegypti consequently became established across the tropical and temperate regions of the Americas, where caused yellow fever epidemics at port cities (Haggett, 2000). Intensive control and eradication schemes in the 1950s and 1960s reduced its extent (Gubler, 2004a). Gradual resurgence following the end of these control campaigns has resulted in the species once again becoming widespread across the Americas, and associated with the emergence of dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever (Gubler and Clark, 1995). Ae. aegypti also invaded tropical Asia, where its dispersal has again been associated with a rise in dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever incidence (Gubler and Clark, 1995).",

An. gambiae proved extremely well suited to parts of Brazil where the temperature, humidity and precipitation patterns match closely malaria endemic regions of East Africa (Killeen et al., 2002; Killeen, 2003). Its gradual spread over 10 years into 54 000 km2 of Northeast Brazil led to extensive malaria epidemics, costing 16 000 lives and around 3 billion USD (modern day estimate) in healthcare, drugs and the vector eradication programme (Killeen et al., 2002). These epidemics were based solely on the greater vectorial capacity of An. gambiae relative to local mosquito species, as malaria was already endemic in Brazil. Similarly, high mortality rates were seen on Mauritius when An. gambiae was introduced accidentally in 1866, sparking major malaria epidemics (Lounibos, 2002). Control efforts ended the epidemics, but low-level and localized rural transmission continues.",

Since the initial introduction, the mosquito has spread to Connecticut (Mustermann and Andreadis, 1999), Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio (Lounibos, 2002). The discovery of wild-caught Ae. japonicus infected with West Nile virus (WNV) (Turell et al., 2001) and the mosquito's competence as a vector of Japanese encephalitis suggest that it could become of public health importance in North America. Ae. japonicus was also recently detected in Orne Departement in Northern France and in New Zealand, demonstrating its potential to expand into Europe and Australasia (Laird et al., 1994; Schaffner et al., 2003).",

Although Ae. aegypti is the principal vector of dengue fever, recent outbreaks of the disease in the absence of Ae. aegypti have implicated Ae. albopictus as a competent vector (Gratz, 2004; Effler et al., 2005). The range expansion of Ae. albopictus from its Old World distribution (Figure 1\n) over the past 75 years is perhaps the best documented of any vector invasion. The mosquito spread from its range initially to the Pacific Islands (Gratz, 2004) in the 1930s and then, within the last 20 years, to other countries in both the Old and New Worlds (Moore and Mitchell, 1997; Gratz, 2004). This is thought to have been through ship-borne transportation of eggs and larvae in tyres (Reiter and Sprenger, 1987; Reiter, 1998). The spread of Ae. albopictus throughout the Eastern USA from its discovery in Harris County, Texas, in 1985 has been monitored extensively (Moore and Mitchell, 1997; Moore, 1999). Figure 2\nshows its extent in 2000.",

To ensure that a representative climate was included, where possible, up to eight land pixels surrounding each seaport/airport grid square were also identified, forming a 3\u00d73 grid square window centred on the airport/port. This requirement was not met for airports located coastally or on small islands or for the majority of seaports. In these cases, reduced numbers of land pixels were extracted. Any seaports/airports located on islands too small to be represented by the climatology surfaces were eliminated from the analysis (reducing the sample size to 241 seaports and 259 airports). The selected grid square data from the nine climatology surfaces thus formed the climate \u2018signatures\u2019 used in the analyses.

This allowed for the fact that Ae. albopictus has both temperate (diapausing) and tropical (non-diapausing) races with distinct environmental requirements and different original geographical distributions (Hawley et al., 1987). Thus, the 90% cut-off on the seaports dendrogram (Figure 3a) encompassed a single branch, but contained two major sub-branches, with the remaining 10% of ports displaying quite distinct environments (Mormugao, New-Mangalore and Kuching). Ninety percent of airports within the pre-expansion distribution of Ae. albopictus can be encompassed in a single branch of the airport dendrogram (Figure 3b), but temperate and tropical races are again distinguishable within this branch. Those seaports/airports not within its historical distribution, but linked by a dendrogram branch within the climatic envelope were therefore identified as being similar enough climatically for there to be a risk of establishment.",

Each matrix was rescaled independently to a range of 0\u20131 and the results for the climatic matrix then inverted so that values near to 1 represented similar climates and values close to 0 represented dissimilar ones. Values in the two rescaled matrices for any pair of ports\u2014one with and one without the invading species in question\u2014were then multiplied together to estimate the relative risk of invasion and establishment. As an example, the rescaled climatic distance between Chiba, Japan and Richards Bay, South Africa was 0.9703, reflecting similar climatic regimes, while the rescaled traffic volume on the route was just 0.0012, a low-traffic volume in global terms. When these are multiplied, we arrive at a disease vector invasion risk of 0.00116, which is low in comparison to the risk value of 0.35 for the Chiba to New Orleans, USA, route and may partly explain why Ae. albopictus invaded New Orleans successfully, but not Richards Bay (to date).",

The values relative to route 1 and the recorded details of this mosquito's spread are included in both tables. There is correspondence between the predicted risk routes in Table 1 and the global invasions or interception of Ae. albopictus. Three of the top 10 shipping routes run from Japan to the south-east United States, where some of the earliest breeding populations of Ae. albopictus were found and identified as originating from Japan (Lounibos, 2002). Genoa, the destination of five more routes from Japan in the top 20, was one of the earliest European cities to report Ae. albopictus establishment in 1990 (Romi et al., 1999); the vector has since become the most important local nuisance mosquito (Gratz, 2004). Of the remaining routes in Table 1, interceptions of Ae. albopictus in tyre shipments from Japan to Australasia have been made in both Brisbane (Kay et al., 1990) and Auckland (Laird, 1990; Laird et al., 1994), but the species appears not to have become established there, probably due to strict inspection and fumigation policies (Lounibos, 2002). No documented evidence exists of invasion by Ae. albopictus of Fraser and Vancouver (Canada). On the basis of Fraser's and Vancouver's climatic similarities to, and the seaborne traffic levels from, Japan, these ports should be considered at high risk, especially as Ae. albopictus has already been intercepted at nearby Seattle (CDC, 1986).",

Within this group of 47 ports, the average climatic distances of the 24 invaded and 23 non-invaded ports were identical, but sea traffic volumes were 2.43 times greater in the former than the latter (41.84 ship visits per annum per route for invaded ports and 17.24 for non-invaded ones), with the difference found to be significant (t=2.343, p=0.024). Sea traffic volumes, therefore, appear to make an important contribution to relative invasion risk. This result corroborates recent theories regarding direct linkage between biological invasion success and propagule pressure (Vila and Pujadas, 2001; Levine and D\u2019Antonio, 2003; Normile, 2004; Lockwood et al., 2005).",

In every one of the top 20 high-risk air routes, Ae. albopictus has been either intercepted or found breeding at the destinations listed.",

            "text": "In addition to determining at which seaport or airport an accidentally introduced disease vector is likely to become established, it is important to identify the areas to which vectors may subsequently spread. An initial assessment of this can be undertaken by examining the climatic distance of the surrounding area from the disease vector's origin. This was tested for Ae. albopictus, again using gridded climatologies (New et al., 2002). Given that the origin of the invasive Ae. albopictus was found to be Japan (Moore, 1999; Gratz, 2004), and the above analysis found Chiba to be the likely origin port, the climatic signature of Chiba was used to calculate a global climatic distance image at 10\u2032 spatial resolution. In this analysis, the \u2018Mahalanobis\u2019 distance rather than the Euclidean distance of every 10\u2032 pixel from Chiba's signature was calculated. The Mahalanobis distance differs from Euclidean distance as it accounts for the correlations of the dataset by examining the similarity between each signature's covariance matrix (ERDAS, 2003). The results are shown in Figure 4a\n, with a close-up of the USA in Figure 4b. Comparison with maps of known Ae. albopictus invasion (Figure 1, Figure 2; Lounibos, 2002) shows good correspondence, demonstrating the broad applicability of the approach in estimating future disease vector movement. The dark regions (indicating climatic similarity to Chiba) across Europe and in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, indicate that given the opportunity provided by transport networks, Ae. albopictus may spread yet further. Future work on invasion risk should focus on the incorporation of data on land transport routes, human population distribution and how these relate spatially to endemic disease regions.",

The enforcement by the World Health Organization of yellow fever vaccination requirements for travel to endemic regions, and consequent minimal movement of the disease, demonstrates the effectiveness of global control measures. Despite advances in preventative measures and the existence of a reliable vaccine, yellow fever outbreaks and epidemics have increased in recent years, particularly in Africa (Mutebi and Barrett, 2002). Many of these epidemics have been caused by the large-scale movements of susceptible individuals into high yellow fever risk zones and by the neglect of control procedures (Mutebi and Barrett, 2002).",

The past 30 years has seen a marked global emergence and re-emergence of epidemic dengue, with more frequent and larger epidemics associated with more severe disease (Mackenzie et al., 2004). Fuelled by the expansion of the range of its principal vector, Ae. aegypti (Lounibos, 2002), the expansion of the range of what may be an urban\u2013rural bridge vector, Ae. albopictus (Lounibos, 2002; Gratz, 2004), large-scale global urbanization (Gubler, 2004b; Tatem and Hay, 2004) and increasing movement by air of people incubating its infections (Upham et al., 2003), dengue is fast becoming the most important arboviral disease of humans (Mackenzie et al., 2004). The global air transport network is not only aiding the spread of both dengue vectors and virus serotypes within tropical regions suitable for transmission, but also facilitating a substantial increase of imported cases elsewhere (Jelinek, 2000; Frank et al., 2004; Effler et al., 2005; Shu et al., 2005).",

The appearance of WNV in New York in 1999 and its subsequent spread westwards across the United States (Petersen and Hayes, 2004) and into Central America represents the best-documented movement of a disease in recent times (Granwehr et al., 2004). Spread by many different species of mosquitoes and the movement of birds, it is less influenced by human transportation networks than other diseases discussed in this review, but its arrival in the US in 1999 is thought to be associated with some form of commerce or human travel. With changing climate, coupled with increased human movement and spread of exotic mosquitoes via global transport networks, the risks of further WNV outbreaks are a distinct possibility (Granwehr et al., 2004; Medlock et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The last 25 years have seen both the numbers and types of malaria imported to high-income countries change significantly. Figures 5a\nand b highlight the trends in imported cases to the UK and USA, respectively. Figure 5a shows that the UK consistently had 1500\u20132500 cases of malaria every year reported since 1977. However the proportion of P. falciparum malaria has risen substantially (Malaria Reference Laboratory, 2004). Figure 5b demonstrates that while the USA has fewer imported malaria cases annually than the UK, the trend towards increasing numbers of P. falciparum cases continues. The rise in P. falciparum cases in the USA is mirrored by a substantial rise in cases acquired in Africa (Figure 5c). The precise causes of the decline in imported Plasmodium vivax cases and increase in those of P. falciparum in the UK and USA are difficult to determine given the myriad of factors involved in transmission, including changes over time of levels and types of antimalarial use, malaria prevalence, travel activities and reporting efficiency. What is clear, however, is that over the past few decades, travel from the UK and USA to SSA, where P. falciparum malaria is highly endemic, has risen steadily. Analysis of UK Civil Aviation Authority (UKCAA) statistics shows that the number of passengers travelling on flight routes between SSA and the UK rose by around a million between 1997 and 2003 (Figure 5d), with the largest rises on routes from West Africa, where the highest levels of P. falciparum malaria endemicity are found (see Guerra et al., this volume, pp. 157\u2013179).",

Since the first reports of chloroquine resistance 50 years ago, drug-resistant malaria has posed a major and increasing problem in malaria control (Hastings and Mackinnon, 1998; Anderson and Roper, 2005; Hastings and Watkins, 2005). Chloroquine resistance is now worldwide, while resistance to newer drugs is appearing in many regions, especially in South-east Asia, where multidrug resistance is a major public health problem (Wongsrichanalai et al., 2002; Roper et al., 2004). The growth in global travel and human migration is assumed to have caused this spread, with the speed of spread of resistance mirroring its expansion. Though chloroquine remained effective for some 20 years before signs of resistance emerged, it is unlikely that a similar period of grace can be realistically expected for recently deployed treatments given the current levels of global travel (Hartl, 2004).",

Figure 6\nsummarises the locations and time of year of these probable airport malaria cases. An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes have been shown to survive long haul flights (Misao and Ishihara, 1945; Russell, 1987, Russell, 1989). For example, in a three-week period in 1994, it was estimated that 2000\u20135000 Anopheline mosquitoes were imported into France by 250\u2013300 aircraft arriving from malaria-endemic regions of Africa, at the rate of 8\u201320 Anopheline mosquitoes per flight (Gratz et al., 2000). The ever expanding global transport network, increased travel to malaria-endemic countries and a decline in aircraft disinsection (Gratz et al., 2000), mean the numbers of malaria-infected Anopheles arrivals will only increase, resulting in more cases of airport malaria.",

Here, we extend the methodology outlined in Section 3.5 and review the approaches outlined in Tatem et al. (2006b) to examine the latter in terms of a basic exploratory analysis of the monthly risks of P. falciparum malaria-infected An. gambiae importation by plane from Africa, causing consequent autochthonous transmission. While globally, the movement of P. vivax malaria-infected mosquitoes may occur more frequently and pose more of an invasion risk to many regions, it is the movement of P. falciparum-infected Anopheles that has resulted in numerous airport malaria cases. Additionally, the possible effects of invasion of malaria endemic regions by An. gambiae have been seen in the devastating malaria epidemics in Brazil and Mauritius (Lounibos, 2002). The likelihood, however, of a more than very temporary establishment of P. falciparum or An. gambiae through air travel to Europe and many other locations remains low. Unsuitable year-round climate, An. gambiae's intolerance of urban areas (Hay et al., 2005) and competition from local mosquitoes that are inefficient vectors of P. falciparum all provide barriers to establishment.",

Although malaria has been eradicated in the UK, re-introduction is theoretically possible (Hay et al., 2000). This risk is negligible, however, as the majority of the former habitats of An. atroparvus have disappeared and returning travellers are rapidly diagnosed and treated, and in any case rarely live near suitable vector habitats (Kuhn et al., 2003). This is supported by the analyses presented above and the fact that not one of the 52 000 imported malaria cases reported since 1953 has led to a secondary case.

Climate dissimilarity matrices were created for each month, and these were clustered hierarchically to create 12 global airport dendrograms, one for each month of the year. Airport malaria cases represent instances where imported infected mosquitoes have caused autochthonous malaria transmission and, therefore, were used to define climatic suitability thresholds on each dendrogram. Malaria seasonality maps for Africa (Tanser et al., 2003) were used to identify the timing of the principal malaria transmission season at each SSA airport to identify when exported Anopheles were most likely to be malarious. Finally, the situation in 2000 was examined using the air traffic database described in Section 3.5, and future risks of opening new air routes were examined by analysing climatic similarities between airports and synchrony with malaria transmission seasons.",

The results indicate that many airports in other regions of the world are more favourable climatically for Anopheles survival, and for many more months of the year than European destinations. The concentration of major airports in the temperate north means that July (summer in this region) on Figure 7 shows the largest number of potentially suitable destinations climatically, mainly linked to West African airports, including those in Europe where most SSA air traffic is directed, causing cases of airport malaria in the summer months particularly in unusually hot and humid periods. The other three months on Figure 7 show considerably fewer at risk airports, though throughout the year, Caribbean and Central American airports are highlighted consistently, indicating that their climates vary in synchrony most closely with the cycle of African malaria transmission seasons.",

            "text": "Increases in global travel are occuring simultaneously with many other processes that favour the emergence of disease (Wilson, 1995). Travel is a potent force in disease emergence and spread, whether it is aircraft moving human-incubated pathogens, or insect vectors, great distances in short times, or ships transporting used tyres containing mosquito eggs. The speed and complexity of modern transport make both geographical space and the traditional \u2018drawbridge\u2019 strategy of disease control and quarantine increasingly irrelevant (Haggett, 2000). With no apparent end in sight to the continued growth in global air travel and shipborne trade, we must expect the continued appearance of communicable disease pandemics, disease vector invasions and vector-borne disease movement. Approaches that can model, predict and explain such events can be used to focus surveillance and control efforts efficiently. This review has shown that the risk of movement of infectious diseases and their vectors through the global transportation network can be predicted to provide such information. Future challenges must focus on incorporating information on temporal variations in passenger numbers, stopover risks, intra-species competition, human populations at risk, breeding site availability, possible climate change, disinsection and land transport, as well as quantifying the relative importance of all types of transport for vector and disease movement.",
