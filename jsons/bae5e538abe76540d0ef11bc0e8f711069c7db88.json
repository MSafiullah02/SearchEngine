The pandemic infection control measures, including social distancing and cross hospital movement restrictions, have created unprecedented challenges to training. Psychiatry residents cannot meet in groups, go outside of their current sites to do clinical work or attend educational activities, and ambulatory teams have halted home visits and day treatment programmes. However, in the process, other clinical learning opportunities have unexpectedly arisen. To help with shifting demands (e.g. psychiatric emergency and inpatient services), some psychiatry residents have been assigned to different services than the ones belonging to their rotations. Several residents have volunteered for deployment to medical facilities which are set up in the community, and are assisting medical teams in managing clinically ill patients. There are ongoing discussions between the residency program committee, central educational office and health authorities to ensure that requisite training rotations are being fulfilled as best as possible at the respective training sites. Some of the arrangements include switching the order of some of the rotations, and allocating buffer training periods to those who may be affected due to various deployments.",

This time, technological advancements such as videoconferencing have been implemented to reduce disruptions in residency training. When psychiatry residents and their clinical supervisors could not meet up due to movement restrictions, they switched to videoconferencing. In this way, residents continued to discuss clinical cases with their supervisors, and in turn, the supervisors continued to assess the clinical skills and competencies of their residents. One year ago, the residency program moved the resident evaluation process from a paper-based to an online platform. This change proved timely.",

Essential and compulsory courses (e.g., ACLS, medical ethics) have also leveraged the videoconferencing platform to maintain interactivity. Through the live chat function, residents may submit questions without interrupting the tutor, a process that is unavailable with the traditional lecture. Psychiatry residents are responding tirelessly despite increased clinical demands, considerable manpower constraints, and suspension of prolonged period of holiday. Risks include burnout, coupled with fears of contracting the virus and the risks to their loved ones in close contact (Fessel and Cherniss, 2020; Ripp et al., 2020) . Clinical supervisors have been keeping tabs on residents' emotional well-being and emphasising self-care. They update residents on changes in training schedules as they occur. While gathering feedback can be easily overlooked due to workload, disrupted schedules, and deployments, it is critical to keep up with such efforts in the long haul. The digital platforms described have made this possible.",

This is the 'new normal' of training for residents, faculty, and administrators, in the upcoming months and longer. However, limitations of digital platforms need to be borne in mind. Compared to in-person meetings, differences with videoconferencing include the depth and spontaneity of individual and group interactions, the possibility of distractions especially when multitasking, as well as the narrower range and quality of patient responses that can be observed and assessed during clinical direct observation. A great deal of tolerance and flexibility is required of residents, supervisors, and administrators, in continuing to foster committed learning and teaching within a community of practice, during this current evolving pandemic.",
