Intensive efforts have been made to find ways to stabilize proteins using various approaches (Bam et al., 1998, Zlateva et al., 1999, Braun and Alsenz, 1997, Kline, 2001, Gross, 1998, Yuen and Kline, 1999, Kwan, 1989). However, so far, not many studies have been able to determine the conditions required for stability with any certainty. Specifically, protein aggregation is a major problem to physical stability of protein solution. In view of this, establishing a methodology that is able to rapidly and effectively monitor the factors affect the interactions between protein molecules is essential.",

It is accepted that a negative value of b\n2 indicates a global attraction between the molecules, implying a high possibility of aggregation. In addition, b\n2, can be derived from osmotic measurements as well. The osmotic b\n2 can provide a thermodynamic link between molecular structure and the potential of attractions at various solution conditions, similar to the one measured by calorimetry. However, the amount of sample required for measuring this coefficient by membrane osmometry, or light scattering is much larger than by calorimetry (Haynes et al., 1992, Velev et al., 1998, Bajaj et al., 2004). This drawback limits the application of this coefficient for those pharmaceutical proteins with low concentrations and limited amounts.",

Interferons (IFNs) are a group of proteins, which can be produced by various cells upon infection by viruses and double strain RNAs (Sen, 2001). Specifically, IFNs can be divided into two groups in accordance with their various cell surface receptors and unrelated structural properties: IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c9, \u03b4 and \u03c4 belong to type I IFN (among them, IFN-\u03b1 has many subtypes such as IFN-\u03b12a, IFN-\u03b12b), while only IFN-\u03b3 is a type II IFN (Stepwart et al., 1980). IFNs have great potential as drugs for the treatment of various virus-infected diseases such as hepatitis C (Lake-Bakaar, 2001) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Cinatl et al., 2003), but they are very unstable, and their activities can be reduced during bioprocessing, storage, freezing as well as lyophilizing. Thus, while IFNs are suitable molecules for clinical application, it is necessary and important that factors affect physical stability of IFN solution should be explored prior to develop the stable IFN formulations.",

The corresponding statistic data were summarized in Table 1\n. Since the heat of dilution indicates the interactions between protein molecules and/or other small molecules, such as salts, the dilution enthalpy change of a protein solution should be an index of the interactions between protein molecules. For instance, a positive (endothermic) value for dilution enthalpy implies that there are attractive forces between the protein molecules, that is, the protein unfavorably dissolves into the buffer solution. In this study, the results reveal that the interactions between the hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules were attractive and increased with temperature. This is mainly attributed to enhanced hydrophobic interactions, resulting from the structural changes to the protein under the heating process. Since the compact conformation of the protein became loosely at a higher temperature and gradually exposed its hydrophobic regions to the solvent, increased hydrophobic attractions thus can be expected. The study of Sharma and Kalonia (2003) on temperature effect of hrIFN-\u03b12a structure by circular dichroism also reveals that a significant loss in the tertiary structure of hrIFN-\u03b12a by increasing temperature from 15 to 50 \u00b0C.",

The results demonstrate that the attractions between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules increased with NaCl concentration. This is because in the presence of salts, the native structure of hrIFN-\u03b12a shifts towards being less compact and the solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces increased, leading to stronger hydrophobic interactions between protein molecules. Furthermore, the strength of electro-repulsion between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules would seem to be decreased with increasing salt concentrations. Consequently, protein aggregation can be caused either by enhancing hydrophobic interactions or by decreasing electro-repulsive forces between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules. The SEC chromatogram also confirms this. In Fig. 7\n, the chromatogram shows that an additional peak with a molecular weight of about 44.7 kDa mainly due to aggregation of hrIFN-\u03b12a appeared in the 0.5 M NaCl condition as compared to blank condition. These observations were similar to reported data (Melander and Horvath, 1977), which has shown that proteins can be easily aggregated by adding salts.",

As a consequence, the aggregation of hrIFN-\u03b12a can be increased by adding salts and increasing the salt concentration, although salts usually serve as an isotonizing agent in commercial IFN formulations (Gross, 1998, Yuen and Kline, 1999).",

The data show that the attractive forces between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules changed at the pH values studied. Specifically, at pH 6, the attraction between hrIFN-\u03b12a is much stronger than that at pH 7 or 8. This is because at pH 6, which is near the pI of hrIFN-\u03b12a (5.7), the protein becomes electro-neutralized, the repulsions between the protein molecules are minimized and the hydrophobic attractions enhanced. This is also supported by the literature (Yuen and Kline, 1999), where the formation of hrIFN-\u03b12a aggregation as well as the adsorption of hrIFN-\u03b12a onto the glass surface, reached a maximum at pH 5\u20136. Note that selection of an optimal pH value for an IFN solution needs careful consideration. For example, in addition to physical stability as discussed above, the degradation of hrIFN-\u03b12a can be minimized at a pH near pI (Yuen and Kline, 1999). Therefore, an optimal pH value for stabilizing the IFN solution should be determined by analysis of a variety of factors.",

The data shown on Table 1 demonstrate that the attractions between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules can be significantly increased by mechanical stress, partly due to change in the structural conformation of hrIFN-\u03b12a molecule, especially under vortex conditions. This observation is further confirmed by the SEC results. As shown in Fig. 7, an additional peak with a molecular weight higher than 67 kDa (out of the calibration range) was obtained under vortex treatment compared to the untreated condition, and this is probably the aggregated form of hrIFN-\u03b12a. This is also similar to a previous report (Bam et al., 1998), where the \u03b1-helical content of IFN-\u03b3 decreased with the introduction of mechanical stress, such as agitation, leading to the irreversible conformational changes and this favored protein aggregation. It should be noted that the significant effect of vortexing is probably more a result of the exposure to air (hydrophobic interface) than the solely changes in protein structure. Furthermore, the process of inactivation by mechanical stress during bioprocessing probably involves either the linking together of the sulfhydryl groups or disulfide interchange reactions to form inter or intra-molecular disulfide bridges, leading IFN to adopt a biologically inactive configuration. From this point of view, reducing agents such as reduced glutathione, can be applied to retain IFN sulfhydryl groups in a reduced state without affecting the disulfide linkages which are essential for IFN activity (Yuen and Kline, 1999).",

            "text": "Tween 20 is useful as a stabilizer and prevents adsorption of proteins (such as recombinant human growth hormone and recombinant human factor XIII) onto stainless steel or glass surfaces or damage from the mechanical stress as well as protein aggregation (Bam et al., 1998, Kreilgaard et al., 1998). In this study, two concentrations of Tween 20, 0.01% (w/v), and 0.02% (w/v), equals to 86 and 172 \u03bcM, respectively, were studied. The results presented in Table 1 demonstrate that the attractions between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules can be minimized with the addition of Tween 20, probably because the hydrophobic patches on the hrIFN-\u03b12a surface are able to bond with (or are blocked by) this non-ionic surfactant, and therefore, there is a decrease in the hydrophobic interactions. Specifically, the attractions between hrIFN-\u03b12a decreased with the concentration of Tween 20, although the difference in b\n2 values between 0.01 and 0.02% of Tween 20 is not significant. This result is also similar to the study of Kreilgaard et al. (1998), where the insoluble protein aggregates are not obviously decreased by an increasing concentration of Tween 20 from 60 to 250 \u03bcM. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, the SEC chromatogram demonstrates that no aggregated form of hrIFN-\u03b12a appeared in the presence of 0.01% Tween 20. Note that the shoulder on the monomeric hrIFN-\u03b12a peak is probably due to the retention behavior of the protein being changed by the surfactant.",

            "text": "Physically, proteins can be stabilized in two ways: stabilizing the inter-molecular forces (the structural conformation) or decreasing the attractive inter-molecular forces (protein\u2013protein interactions). The latter interaction may also be seen as an increase in the repulsive inter-molecular forces. In this study, a brief survey on the effects of interactions between hrIFN-\u03b12a molecules was achieved by ITC measurements and SEC so as to evaluate the applicability of the calorimetric b\n2. The data obtained shows that the storage of hrIFN-\u03b12a solution at a low temperature and/or at a pH away from its pI, together with a limitation of mechanical stress on the protein in the presence of the correct concentration of a surfactant such as Tween 20 can really decrease attractive protein\u2013protein interactions and thus minimizes hrIFN-\u03b12a aggregation. However, it should be noted that the addition of salts can stabilize the structural conformation of hrIFN-\u03b12a, but also enhances protein aggregation as well. These data demonstrate that the identification of a formulation able to stabilize protein physically will depend critically on balancing the intra- and inter-molecular forces. As a consequence, optimization of protein stability requires a systematic approach, and our results show that using ITC to carry out such a systematic study of the physical stability of protein solution is possible.",
