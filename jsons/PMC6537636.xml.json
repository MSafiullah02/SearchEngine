Due to this adoption, there are diverse strains and types of bacteria. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in both men and women. However, the incidence is higher among women due to female anatomy.[23] It is a condition where one or several parts of the urinary system such as urethra, kidney, or bladder become infected. It may occur at any particular period of life.[23] Moreover, it is one of the most frequently occurring infection reported in both inpatients and outpatients, and may lead to mortality.[4] UTIs may not occur if bacteria are introduced into the bladder due to body\u2019s immune defense that helps protecting the urinary tract.",

Antibiotic usage in this condition has faced resistance from Escherichia coli strains. Moreover, the microbial flora colonizing vaginal cavity as well as gastrointestinal tract could be affected by short antibiotic courses.[1920] Initial use of an antibiotic is a major determinant of antibiotic-resistant UTIs.[2122] Several studies have reported E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonadaceae as most common bacteria causing UTIs.[2324252627]",
