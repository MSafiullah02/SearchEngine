Unfortunately, in Italy we are experiencing the same difficulties in terms of surgical and educational planning. At present, we can run the operating theatres in our institution for <10% of the usual activity level and residents are experiencing a temporary lack of teaching caused by both postponement of rotations and the reduction in clinical and surgical activity. Surgical theatres for emergency and urgent cases are guaranteed, while elective cases have been scaled down according to recommendations [2], [3], [4] and common sense. However, we are surprisingly experiencing a huge decrease in urgent urological cases presenting to the emergency department.",

We reviewed all urological consultations in the emergency department over the last 60 d and divided them into three groups: group A, from January 29 to February 17; group B, from February 18 to March 8; and group C, from March 9 to March 28. Group A comprised 63 patients (3.15 patients/d), group B 38 (1.9 patients/d), and group C only 17 (0.85 patients/d). Stone-related cases accounted for 35 patients in group A (55.5%), 18 in group B (47.3%), and only six (35.3%) in group C. Haematuria was the reason for consultation for 11 patients in group A (17.5%), nine in group B (23.7%), and four (23.5%) in group C. While it is reasonable to expect that lockdown and quarantine might decrease the number of case presentations for some reasons such as urological trauma, urological infections, and related conditions (eg, acute urinary retention), it is more difficult to understand a huge decrease in presentations for renal colic.",

Moreover, this attitude could lead to future consultation requests from the same patients in worse clinical conditions with further overload of the health care system.",
