Since 1957 when the fi rst case of glucocorticoid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis (GI-FHON) was reported [ 3 ] , many human and animal studies have reported an association between glucocorticoids and FHON.

Among rabbits receiving methylprednisolone, those with increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increased free fatty acids, or decreased hepatic cytochrome P4503A activity are at high risk of developing GI-FHON [ 27 , 28 ] .",

Additionally, methylprednisolone pulse therapy and cytotoxic agents have also been found to be related to GI-FHON [ 29 -32 ] . Generally, SLE patients with more active diseases are more likely to receive glucocorticoids in higher doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy or cytotoxic agents. However, there are discrepancies regarding results on SLE disease activity between patients with and without the development of GI-FHON [ 33 , 34 ] . The majority of GI-FHON cases develop within 3-12 months of initiation of glucocorticoid treatment [ 8 , 31 ] .

In addition to the use of glucocorticoids, several features of SLE have been identifi ed as risk factors: thrombophlebitis, vasculitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, renal dysfunction, arthritis, smoking, preeclampsia, and so on [ 6 , 30 ] . In contrast, nested case-control studies have revealed that the use of glucocorticoids is the only risk factor for GI-FHON [ 32 , 33 ] .

Additionally, female patients have a higher risk of GI-FHON than males [ 20 , 21 , 43 , 44 ] . Intensive therapy with dexamethasone confers a high incidence of GI-FHON [ 20 , 22 ] , and alternate-week scheduling of dexamethasone can reduce the development of GI-FHON [ 43 , 44 ] . In some studies, patients receiving dexamethasone more frequently developed FHON than those receiving prednisone [ 43 ] . An association between FHON and poor dexamethasone clearance has been reported [ 22 ] . In patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, both an episode of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the use of glucocorticoid are risk factors [ 17 ] . The incidence of GI-FHON has been reported to be higher in patients receiving unrelated donor transplants than in those receiving allogenic matched related donor or autologous transplants [ 17 , 45 ] .",

Additionally, the multisystemic effects of glucocorticoids and their interactions make the pathological mechanisms more complicated. In this context, the multi-hit theory proposed by several investigators is a plausible explanation for the development of GI-FHON [ 46 , 56 ] . In susceptible patients who have a genetic predisposition or an underlying disease that threatens bone and vascular tissues, the accumulative glucocorticoid effects may result in the occurrence of GI-FHON ( Fig. 11.1 ) .

The accumulated evidence of in vitro studies as well as studies of patients with Cushing syndrome suggests that glucocorticoids increase the PAI-1 activity, resulting in a relatively hypercoagulable state [ 74 ] . The plasma level of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a marker of endothelial cell damage because the vWF is synthesized and stored in the endothelial cells. Plasma vWF levels are reported to increase in subjects with exogenous or endogenous excess glucocorticoids, and dexamethasone induces the expression of vWF, cell adhesion molecules, and tissue factor in vascular endothelial cells [ 75 ] . Since vWF is involved in platelet aggregation and adhesion, glucocorticoid-induced endothelial damage may contribute to thrombi formation.",

The pain onset often can be described as acute. The pain is usually deep and throbbing and becomes worse with ambulation. Patients frequently complain of a catching or popping sensation with motion. In patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment, especially in higher doses, persistent hip pain with joint movement, tenderness, or reduced range of motions indicates the need for a prompt workup for GI-FHON. On physical examination, limitation of internal rotation in both fl exion and extension is observed, with passive internal rotation in extension being particularly painful. A Trendelenburg gait is often present. Additionally, some characteristic features of chronic glucocorticoid users can be seen: moon face, central obesity, and buffalo hump. Anteroposterior radiographs and frog lateral radiographs of both hips are the primary diagnostic modalities, while plain radiographic fi ndings are frequently normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideal if x-ray fi ndings are normal and clinical suspicion is high [ 9 , 37 ] . The sensitivity and specifi city of MRI are both greater than 98 % for the diagnosis of osteonecrosis, which is higher than those of other diagnostic modalities. Therefore, MRI should be performed in all patients with osteonecrosis to assess the extent of the disease. Three-dimensional MRI with image registration can be used to assess changes in lesion size [ 76 , 88 ] . Bone scan may be helpful when x-ray fi ndings are normal and when MRI cannot be performed. It may be low-cost alternative when the suspicion index is low [ 77 , 89 ] .",

However, the natural history of nontraumatic FHON cannot represent that of GI-FHON because subtypes of nontraumatic FHON may have different pathogenic mechanisms and underlying conditions necessitating glucocorticoids can affect the course of FHON. The results of studies using MRI to diagnose asymptomatic GI-FHON are summarized in Table 11 .3 [ 7 , 11 , 78 -83 ] . About one-third of patients with asymptomatic early GI-FHON have symptomatic or radiological progression over a period of several years. Thus, clinical progression or subchondral collapse rate seems to be lower than the other subtypes of nontraumatic FHON, especially FHON associated with sickle cell anemia. Sometimes small lesions of GI-FHON are reported to be spontaneously resolved [ 81 -83 ] . However, as with other subtypes, femoral head collapse develops most often in GI-FHON patients with larger osteonecrosis areas (>15-30 %), lesions occupying the weight-bearing surface, higher radiographic stages, or hip pain [ 84 ] . There is no established risk stratifi cation system to exactly estimate outcomes in GI-FHON patients. Because proper therapeutic decisions depend on the natural course of FHON, more extended studies are needed to develop an improved risk classifi cation system.",

Among them, the preventive effect of statin and warfarin was evaluated in patients receiving glucocorticoids; the results concerning statin effects were controversial [ 85 , 86 ] , and warfarin treatment only tended to decrease symptomatic GI-FHON cases in SLE patients [ 87 ] . Additionally, enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, is not helpful in GI-FHON patients [ 88 ] . A single-arm study reported that intravenous infusion of prostaglandin I 2 for 5 days decreased pain and radiographic outcomes in patients with bone marrow edema or early nontraumatic FHON [ 89 ] . However, some evidence suggests that alendronate is a candidate drug for the treatment of early GI-FHON. Although 7 (18 %) of the 40 study subjects had GI-FHON, a randomized controlled study demonstrated that alendronate (70 mg/week for 25 weeks) could signifi cantly prevent the collapse of the femoral head in FHON patients with Steinberg stage IIC or IIIC [ 90 ] . A prospective open-label study, where 28 (47 %) of the 60 patients had GI-FHON, showed symptomatic improvement and minimal or no radiographic progression after 1 year of follow-up [ 91 ] . In another prospective study that included 26 (79 %) of the 33 patients with GI-FHON, alendronate (5 mg/day for 1 year) decreased the frequency of the femoral head collapse [ 92 ] . When the add-on effect of alendronate was studied for 4 years, combination therapy of multiple drilling and alendronate showed a signifi cant benefi t in GI-FHON patients with Ficat stages II and III [ 93 ] . However, a 2-year randomized double-blind study where 12 (23 %) of the 52 patients developed GI-FHON reported no signifi cant effects in the 52 patients at stage IIC or IIIC [ 94 ] . Thus, further studies are warranted to confi rm that alendronate is a potential option to postpone the need for hip surgery in patients with GI-FHON.",
