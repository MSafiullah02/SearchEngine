Approximately 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome (from the 5\u2032-end) comprises open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b, mainly encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), whereas the one-third from the 3\u2032-end is mainly made up of the genes encoding viral structural proteins, such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Alonso et al., 2002, Escors et al., 2003, Penzes et al., 2001). The genome itself may also serve as mRNA, together with other six subgenomic mRNAs transcribed discontinuously from the negative-strand template, forming a nested set of RNAs of different lengths with co-terminal ends (Alonso et al., 2002, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Laude et al., 1990).",

However, many vaccine strategies developed so far have not been entirely successful. Firstly, inactivated TGEV vaccines generally offer poor protection in swine, while the attenuated ones are not ideal in their safety due to the risk of reverting to a virulent form, and some mucosal vaccines may even induce adverse reactions (Holmgren et al., 2003, Opriessnig et al., 2002, Saif and Wesley, 1999, Wesley and Lager, 2003). Furthermore, neonatal piglets may suffer from gastroenteritis within 20 h post-infection and death may happen in 1\u20134 days (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006), whereas current vaccines cannot provide complete protection prior to 7 days after inoculation (Brim et al., 1995, de los Santos et al., 2005). So, it is urgently needed to develop a high-effective, rapid-acting antiviral strategy against TGEV. On the other hand, current research on antiviral protection triggered by RNA interference (RNAi) in vivo mainly employed mice as experimental models (Liu et al., 2006, Palliser et al., 2006). However, studies of candidate therapeutic strategies using an adult mouse model of subclinical enteric viral infections often do not predict their efficacy in neonatal large mammals (Yuan and Saif, 2002).",

Since it was found that experimental introduction of exogenous double-stranded RNA into C. elegans and mammalian cells could specifically silence homologous mRNA (Fire et al., 1998, Elbashir et al., 2001), RNAi has been the most fascinating technique for hostile gene knockdown and viral inhibition (Borkhardt and Heidenreich, 2004, Robson and Sacks, 2005, van Rij and Andino, 2006). Within a few years, a wide variety of disease-associated viruses have been targeted effectively throughout plant, animal and human kingdom, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus and hepatitis viruses (Huelsmann et al., 2006, Li et al., 2005, Shlomai and Shaul, 2004, van Rij and Andino, 2006, Wu et al., 2005).

Lots of sequences homologous to the RdRp coding region of TGEV SC-Y strain (GenBank accession no.: DQ443743) were generated by the web site siRNA designing tools (http://www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder and http://www.oligoengine.com/Home/mid_prodSirna.html_sirna_tool), from which two theoretically effective sequences at nt positions 13160\u201313180 (P1) and 13949\u201313969 (P2) within the open reading frame 1b were selected. To guarantee a similar RNAi effect on different TGEV strains, the two sequences were analyzed by a BLAST search in the GenBank nucleotide database to avoid any similar sequence found in the swine genome, but share a 100% homology within the published sequences of different TGEV strains. To investigate the specificity of viral inhibition, a non-specific sequence (T) also underwent a BLAST analysis and served as a negative control. Their corresponding sequences are separately shown in Table 1\n. To investigate whether shRNA-mediated RNAi could block TGEV infection in ST cells, all the three sequences were generated to make shRNA-expressing plasmids: pEGFP-U6/P1, pEGFP-U6/P2 and pEGFP-U6/T, respectively. The three inserted sequences were arranged as the following alignment: BamHI+ Sense+ Loop+ Antisense+ Termination signal+ SalI+ HindIII (Table 1). Enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene fused in the plasmids was used as a reporter during the transfection efficiency analysis. The RNA transcripts from these U6 promoter-containing plasmids were expected to fold back and form a stem-loop structure with a 19-base pair region homologous to the RdRp gene of TGEV.",

In contrast, two sequence-specific shRNA-expressing plasmids, pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2, could potently block CPE in the cell cultures (Fig. 1B1, B2, C1 and C2). In detail, ST cells transfected with pEGFP-U6/P2 were capable of keeping CPE resistance in all the three repeated wells till cultures were harvested. There were no obvious differences among three independent experiments; however, the pEGFP-U6/P1 elicited different effects on its cells.

In fact, according to microscopic observation on duration of inhibition, ST cells transfected with pEGFP-U6/P2 (0.4 \u03bcg/well) were able to resist to CPE until the experiment was called off 72 h post-infection (data not shown). In their reports, several groups have demonstrated that siRNA/shRNA could apparently reduce virus-induced CPE in cell cultures (He et al., 2006, Mallanna et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2004); moreover, as we have shown (He et al., 2006) the inhibition is dose-dependent. A RT-qPCR analysis further confirmed that the efficient inhibition of viral replication was due to viral RNA degradation. In fact, as the pair of primers, designed for amplifying a region within N gene, could amplify all the same regions within the TGEV genome RNA and subgenomic mRNAs (except the shortest one) simultaneously, the reduction of viral RNAs suggested that not only viral genome RNA itself, but also all its transcripts, required for viral structural protein expression, were decreased.

Similarly, some groups have discussed an \u201coff-target\u201d effect induced by siRNA/shRNA in their reports. Scacheri et al. (2004) and Dahlgren et al. (2006) found no evidence showing that a double-stranded RNA-triggered IFN-associated antiviral pathway was activated or accounted for the non-specific effect, and Scacheri et al. (2004) further speculated that partial complementary sequence matching to \u201coff-target\u201d genes might result in a micro-RNA-like inhibition of translation. More recently, Jackson et al. (2006) confirmed his speculation by claiming that the \u201coff-target\u201d effect triggered by siRNA/shRNA was a ubiquitous phenomenon and resulted from short stretches of sequence complementary to the siRNA/shRNA seed region. Perhaps, according to these findings, there are some short stretches (<7 nt) complementary to TGEV RNA genome within the non-specific sequence (T) accounting for the non-specific inhibition; therefore, employing both a non-specific sequence and a heterologous virus as the negative control in a RNAi experiment may be a good idea [The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) CV777 strain was ever employed as a negative control in our study, and the poor inhibition of PEDV replication triggered by pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 indicated that shRNAs expressed from the two plasmids were TGEV specific (data not shown).]. Based on dose-dependent analyses, Liu et al. (2006) and Lu et al. (2006) found that, similar to sequence-specific inhibition, the non-specific effect also had a positive correlation with the concentration of shRNAs. In addition, during both dose-dependent and CPE analysis, we found that cell toxicity was dose-dependent, too. As the images shown in Fig. 1, when the amount of transfected plasmids reached 0.4 \u03bcg/well, cell morphology began to change and little more dead cells emerged in cultures in contrast to non-treated cells. As Couzin (2006) reported, the cell toxicity increased with the dose of plasmids increasing. Taken together, there may also be a correlation between cell toxicity and inhibition effect (both sequence-specific and non-specific) (Couzin, 2006, Fedorov et al., 2006). Anyway, compared to the slight non-specific effect, two sequence-specific shRNAs exhibited potent ability in silencing TGEV RNAs.",
