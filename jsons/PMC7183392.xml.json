As for good and for bad, all is globally interconnected, that minute incident in China is the reason why we live in lockdown, basic civil liberties are limited, many deaths and suffering, and locally my hospital being near collapse. Hospital de La Princesa, an old 450-bed, tertiary hospital in downtown Madrid, Spain, had its D Day on March 30, 2020, when a total 552 COVID-19 patients were admitted, and 120+ more patients were in the emergency room, impatiently waiting to be admitted [2]. Many two-patient rooms already had three, even four occupants. Our petite, modern ICU room with 17 beds had to be stretched to 73 beds, by invading two surgical theatres turned to critical care, as well as the entire Psychiatric ward. Mirroring ancient times, all mentally ill patients, including those with active, severe paranoid schizophrenia or major depression, were sent home with their relatives to make room for others requiring invasive mechanical ventilations, mostly with improvised ventilators, or by reusing disposable ones, or duplicating machines with home-made technology. Even friends who have been veteran volunteers with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Syria\u2019s civil war, or at Sierra Leone\u2019s Ebola zone, were not ready. Using military terminology, La Princesa was a war-time hospital in the front line; my Respiratory department with thirteen staff plus eight residents, suffered eleven \u201ccasualties\u201d, counting quarantines plus infections plus one admission with severe, bilateral pneumonia. But other Madrid hospitals were hit even harder; colleagues at Hospital La Paz or Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, were suffering an even worse avalanche of patients to care for. All like a modern hecatombe, literally from the ancient Greek \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, hekat\u00f3n, \u201cone hundred\u201d and \u03b2\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, bo\u0169s, \u201cox\u201d, a religious sacrifice of a hundred oxen to indicate a great catastrophe with great mortality, or the end of the world.",

As Dr Landete was explaining to junior residents in the morning clinical round: \u201c-This is the first time that I have seen the occurrence of acute sudden respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in front of my eyes. In the emergency room I was examining a walk-in 52 yr-old, female patient with temperature, malaise and a dry cough, and within 20 min, I had to call an ENT colleague to intubate this patient, as she had developed the fastest, quickest ARDS I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d.

Many of the above have been living for 2 weeks in hotels next to our hospital, extremely and severely sleep deprived for a month already (Fig. 2). Our hospital administrators recommended all staff not to take weekends off until further notice. No one disagreed, trade unions included, out of a 2000+ headcount. And this has been going on for nearly a month. Again, all always with a ready smile. This is the so-called, Esp\u00edritu de La Princesa.",

That was the easy part. Realizing that behind every case there was a personal tragedy, a family loss, slowly broke my heart and my lungs. So many people dying alone in elderly homes and residences, without medical care, without any care. I imagine not even anyone holding their hands.

Or La Peste by French novelist Albert Camus who, at the premature age of 46 died in a car accident near Sens. Camus, not wearing a safety belt in the passenger seat, died instantly. But, what a life! La Peste tells the story of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. Nevertheless. it is not a medical book, but about human passions during and after an outbreak.

However, their work would all be a lost effort without the cleaning personnel, wardens, cooks and cafeteria caterers, administrative workers, security forces, lab technicians, and other hospital-based job groups. They suffer this modern plague equally, often without protection, mostly without recognition, but always proudly; working 24/7, weekends included, and again always with a ready smile.
