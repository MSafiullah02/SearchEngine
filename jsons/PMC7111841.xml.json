This reaction could convert pyran ring into 1,3-oxazin ring during the reaction of pyrane derivatives with acetic anhydride in the present of pyridine (Scheme 1\n). The attractive aspect of the cascade reaction is that the novel construction of 1,3-oxazine and the direct C\u2013N bond formation from C\u2013C bond can be easily achieved via pyridine-mediated acylation in a one-pot operation.",
