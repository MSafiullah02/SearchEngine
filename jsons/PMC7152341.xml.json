As with any infection, occupational infections are controlled by controlling the source of infection, its route of transmission and by protecting susceptible persons. Most occupational infections can be prevented if appropriate measures are implemented. Some occupational infections, especially those for which vaccines are available (e.g. hepatitis B), are more amenable to prevention than others (e.g. hepatitis C). Health education and preventive programs in the workplace provide a good system for minimizing the risk of occupational infections. The largest employer in the United Kingdom \u2013 i.e. the National Health Service \u2013 has a requirement for every health-care facility to have access to an occupational health service. This has helped in reducing the burden of occupationally acquired infections in the health-care community.3 The system is not as well developed in other industries where there is a recognized risk of occupational infections (e.g. in farming).",

Diseases are prescribed when there is a recognized risk to workers in an occupation and where the risk is uncommon or absent in the general population. For some occupational diseases there is a strong association with occupation and the disease may rarely occur outside work (e.g. mesothelioma, coal miner's pneumoconiosis). However, most infections are common in the general population and it is difficult to establish a causal link with the occupation. In lay terms an infection will be attributed to an occupation if it is more likely than not to be caused by that occupation. In epidemiologic terms this means an attributable fraction (the proportion of the additional risk that can be attributed to the exposure in the exposed population) of 50% or more which equates to a relative risk of 2 (a doubling of the background risk caused by exposure).",
