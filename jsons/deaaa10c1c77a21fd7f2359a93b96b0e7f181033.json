            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses a serious public health 33 risk. Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-34 CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral 35 evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for 36 viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal 37 for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high 38 performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment 39 VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic 40 and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation 41 of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library 42 construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes 43 with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on 44 pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully 45 obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-46 CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA 47 is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened 48 hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, 49 versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations 50 during outbreaks, both current and future. 51 52 53 54",

            "text": "As of April 24, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 viral pandemic has affected more than 2.6 55 million people in over 200 countries and territories around the world, and has claimed 56 more than 180 thousand lives. Closely monitoring the genetic diversity and distribution of 57 viral strains at the population level is essential for epidemiological tracking, and for 58 understanding viral evolution and transmission; additionally examining the viral 59 heterogeneity within a single individual is imperative for diagnosis and treatment. The 60 disease-causing pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-61 CoV-2), was identified from early disease cases and its draft genome sequenced within 62 weeks, thanks to the rapid responses from researchers around the world(1, 2). The initial 63 SARS-CoV-2 draft genome was obtained independently from the same early COVID-19 64 patient samples using various conventional RNA-seq sequencing library construction 65 methods. Although these library construction methods successfully generated a draft 66 genome, several drawbacks hinder the use of these methods for routine viral genome 67 sequencing from the surge of clinical samples during an outbreak. 68 69 One direct library construction approach which was used to generate the SARS-CoV-2 70 draft genome(1, 2) essentially captures each sample's entire metatranscriptome, in which 71 SARS-CoV-2 is just one species among many. The abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical 72 swabs, sputum, and stool samples is often low(3, 4), therefore this catch-all method 73 requires deeper sequencing of each sample in order to obtain sufficient coverage and 74 depth of the whole viral genome, which increases the time and cost of sequencing. Target 75 enrichment with spiked-in primers can improve SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage(5), but 76 the reliance on specific primers inherently limits this approach for the profiling of fast 77 evolving viruses such as coronaviruses. The same limitation applies to multiplex RT-PCR-78 based strategies(6). Additionally, once the sample is subject to targeted amplification 79 during the initial reverse transcription (RT) steps, its metatranscriptomic information is lost 80 forever. 81 82 Currently, the most comprehensive strategy is the combination of metatranscriptomics 83 profiling with post-library SARS-CoV-2 target enrichment(6). However, in most 84 4 conventional RNA-seq methods, the double-strand DNA ligation (dsDL) portion of the 85 protocol is usually the most demanding on hands-on time and user technique(7). When 86 superimposed on the target enrichment process, these labor intensive and lengthy 87 protocols become impractical for routine use in the clinic, much less for the timely 88 monitoring of viral genetics and evolution on large volumes of samples during an outbreak. 89 Furthermore, due to the low molecular efficiency of dsDL, these protocols also require a 90 high amount of input material, further restricting their application on clinical samples. 91 92 Summarily, although next generation sequencing platforms are high-throughput and have 93 short turn-around time, library construction from samples -whether including targeted 94 enrichment or not -remains a major bottleneck. To broadly apply viral sequencing on 95 clinical samples, especially during outbreaks when biomedical resources are already 96 limited, a rapid, simple, versatile, and scalable sample library construction method that 97 does not compromise on performance is urgently needed. 98 99 Recently, we reported a new RNA-seq library construction strategy that aims to address 100 some of these challenges: SHERRY avoids the problematic dsDL step in library 101 construction by taking advantage of the newly discovered Tn5 tagmentation activity on 102 RNA/DNA hybrids, to directly tag RNA/cDNA fragments with sequencing adapters (7). As 103 such, SHERRY has minimal sample transfers and greatly reduced hands-on time, making 104 it simple, robust, and suitable for inputs ranging from single cells to 200 ng total RNA. We 105 now combine the advantages of SHERRY with a simplified post-library target enrichment 106 protocol to enable rapid sequencing of high-quality viral genomes from clinical samples. 107 MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment VirAl sequencing or MINERVA, is an easy-to-use, 108 versatile, scalable, and cost-effective protocol that yields high-coverage high-depth viral 109 genomes, while preserving the sample's rich metatranscriptomic profile. The hands-on 110 time required from clinical sample to sequencing-ready library using conventional 111 approaches without enrichment is 190 mins; MINERVA requires only 100 mins hands-on 112 time, and if deep viral coverage is desired, an additional 90 mins for post-library 113 enrichment, totaling 190 mins for the entire workflow (Fig. S1), making MINERVA practical 114 for high-volume, routine clinical use. We applied MINERVA to various types of COVID-19 115 5 samples and successfully obtained up to 10,000-fold SARS-CoV-2 genome enrichment. 116 This strategy will facilitate all studies regarding SARS-CoV-2 genetic variations in the 117 current pandemic, and can also be applied to other pathogens of interest. 118 119 Results 120 Metagenomic RNA enrichment viral sequencing (MINERVA). To analyze both 121 metagenomics and SARS-CoV-2 genetics from COVID-19 patient samples, we 122 developed a two-stage metagenomic RNA enrichment viral sequencing strategy termed 123 MINERVA (Fig. 1) . First, we employed a SHERRY-based RNA-seq pipeline for 124 metagenomic analysis. Since clinical samples may contain DNA, RNA, and possibly 125 carrier RNA, MINERVA starts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) removal and optional 126 simultaneous carrier RNA removal, followed by DNase I treatment. The remaining RNA 127 is then subject to standard SHERRY. Previously we observed 3' bias in SHERRY libraries; 128",

            "text": "to address this, we used 10 ng mouse 3T3 cell total RNA as starting material, and tested 129 whether adding random decamers (N10) during RT could improve coverage evenness 130 (Fig. S2) . Compared with the standard SHERRY protocol, which uses 1 \u00b5M T30VN primer 131 during RT, the supplement of 1 \u00b5M N10 indeed improves gene body coverage evenness, 132 presumably by improving the RT efficiency. When the N10 concentration was further 133 increased to 10 \u00b5M, we observed almost no coverage bias in the gene body. The high 134 N10 concentration can result in an increased rRNA ratio in the product, sometimes as 135 high as 90%, but MINERVA employs rRNA removal as the first step prior to RT, thus 136 negating this problem. We also performed enzyme titration with homemade and 137 commercial Tn5 transposomes. Based on these N10 and Tn5 titration results, we used 138 10 \u00b5M N10 during RT and 0.5 \u00b5l V50 for each 20-\u00b5l tagmentation reaction in all following 139 experiments. The whole procedure from nucleic acid to metagenomic sequencing-ready 140 library, including wait time, takes 5.5 hours (Fig. S1) . 141 142 For target enrichment, we first quantified SARS-CoV-2 abundance in each metagenomic 143 sequencing library using an N gene qPCR assay, and pooled eight libraries based on 144 quantification results. Then we performed standard in-solution hybridization on the pooled 145 library with biotinylated RNA probes covering the whole viral genome. The enrichment 146 6 procedure takes 19 hours; the entire MINERVA pipeline can be completed within 24 hours. 147 148 MINERVA achieves better SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage compared to 149 conventional dsDL strategies. To evaluate its performance on clinical samples, we 150 applied MINERVA on 85 pharyngeal swabs, sputum, or stool samples, collected from 72 151 COVID-19 patients. These patients were admitted to Ditan Hospital within a two-month 235 236 Discussion 237 As of today, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 is still preliminary and much of it extrapolated 238 from past studies of other beta coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. However, the 239 9 epidemiology, physiology, and biology of COVID-19 are evidently unique(9). To speed up 240 our investigation of this virus and the disease it causes, a practical protocol for viral 241 genome research of clinical samples is urgently needed. Currently, methods for 242 transforming clinical samples into sequencing libraries are laborious and painstaking, 243 while clinical personnel at the frontlines are already strained for time and energy. 244 MINERVA minimizes the need for expert technique and hands-on operation; we believe 245 it will be pivotal in accelerating clinical research of SARS-CoV-2. 246 247 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000722. 308 2.

In both MINERVA and dsDL data, we detected low yet significant levels of 164 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The viral ratio is between 10 -7 and 10 -1 . It is worth noting that 165 the SARS-CoV-2 sequence ratio is higher in MINERVA data than in dsDL data (Fig. 2C 166 and 2D), suggesting that MINERVA libraries capture more SARS-CoV-2 sequences. This 167 phenomenon was more prominent for low viral load samples. Though SARS-CoV-2 168 genome coverage and depth was not high in SHERRY results due to low viral ratio and 169 low sequencing depth, performing MINERVA subsequently can enrich the SARS-CoV-2 170 sequence ratio up to 10,000-fold ( Fig. 2E and S5) . As a result, MINERVA gives more 171 complete and deeper coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Fig. 2F and 2G) , despite 172 sequencing dsDL libraries to two orders of magnitude more depth (Fig. 2B) . We achieved 173 even higher quality of MINERVA data by scaling up the reaction volume (Fig. S5) . Using 174 the same samples and the same amount of sequencing data, more input in a higher 175 reaction volume resulted in deeper SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage.",

By assessing the relative compositions of 195 bacterial species and viral species in each sample type, we noted that the bacteria largely 196 account for the difference between stool samples and the other two samples types, not 197 viruses ( Fig. 3A and S6 ). This is likely due to the unique relationship between the 198 microbiome and its environment, subject to host-specific variations. In the stool samples, (Fig. 3B) .

            "text": "novel virus, little known about the evolutionary features of SARS-CoV-2. Recent 216 studies have identified genetic variations and raised the possibility that multiple variants 217 could co-exist in the same host individual. We evaluated the performance of MINERVA in 218 detecting SARS-CoV-2 genetic variations. Aided by deep coverage of the viral genome 219 (Fig. 3E), MINERVA detects genetic variations more effectively than dsDL. Using 85 220 samples, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 mutational profile (Fig. 3E), which was distinct 221 from the Guangdong profile(8). A few mutation sites, including the two linked to S and L 222 strains, were found in multiple samples. Surprisingly, despite high linkage between these 223 two positions, there were 6 samples in which we detected only the T28144C mutation but 224 not the C8782T mutation. Further investigation showed that the T28144C mutant fractions 225 in these 6 samples were all <87%, in contrast to >93% in the other 7 double-mutant 226 samples. These results, together with the intermediate mutation fractions in many other 227 sites, support the co-existence of multiple variants in the same individual. Further 228 investigation is required to understand this phenomenon. 229 230 In summary, MINERVA effectively converts SARS-CoV-2 genomes into sequencing 231 libraries with a simple and quick experimental pipeline, and subsequent target enrichment 232 can further improve SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and genetic variation detection. 233 MINERVA can facilitate the study of SARS-CoV-2 genetics, and be easily implemented to 234 fight future RNA pathogen outbreaks.",

            "text": "250 requires deep, complete coverage of viral genomes from a large number of patients. With 251 the existence of asymptomatic carriers(13) and possible recurrent infections in the same 252 individual(14), longitudinal re-sampling of patients is also important to uncover intra-host 253 viral heterogeneity, but as viral load decreases with time(15), the sensitivity of the sample 254 processing method becomes critical. These studies all require processing large volumes 255 of clinical samples with a highly robust and scalable method that does not compromise 256 on sensitivity. We have demonstrated that MINERVA libraries from clinical samples can 257 generate deep and complete coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that can be used for 258 evolutionary tracing and variant characterization research. 259 260 It is well-established now that SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple organ systems, tissue 261 compartments, and cell types(3, 4, 16, 17). In our profiling of COVID-19 clinical samples 262 from multiple body sites of the same patient, we found that the viral load and viral 263 subtypes vary across different body sites, possibly affected by interactions between 264 microbial and other viral species as well as overall metagenomic diversity present in 265 different microenvironments of each body site. The effects of metatranscriptomic diversity 266 and inter-compartment heterogeneity on SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 symptom 267 severity are also not understood. In particular, it is difficult to obtain high-quality unbiased 268 metatranscriptomes using conventional library construction methods from low-quantity 269 samples, as well as samples such as stool in which bacteria dominate the metatranscriptomes, as conventional methods are not sufficiently sensitive. The 271 versatility of MINERVA as a two-part protocol integrating SHERRY and post-library virus 272 enrichment provides flexibility for sample processing that uses one standard sample 273 pipeline for both highly sensitive metatranscriptomic analysis and targeted deep 274 sequencing of specific transcripts. 275 276MINERVA was not created to be a rapid diagnostic assay; rather, we hope its ease-of-277 use, versatility, scalability, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness will drive adoption of routine 278 sequencing of COVID-19 clinical samples, and thereby facilitate multiple areas of much-279 needed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research for clinicians and researchers.",
