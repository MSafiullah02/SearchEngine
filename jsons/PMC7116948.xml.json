            "text": "Colds and flu, collectively referred to in biomedical terms as upper respiratory tract infections or URTIs, are the most common infections in human beings. Adults may have between two and five episodes of the cold in a year, and schoolchildren from five to seven episodes (Eccles, 2005). During the twentieth century biomedical understanding of URTIs was primarily focused on the identification of the viral agents that are regarded by medical professionals as their main cause. Influenza virus was first identified during the 1930s, and during the 1950s and 60s numerous viruses including rhinovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus were associated with the common cold (Heikkinen & J\u00e4rvinen, 2003). By the beginning of the current century over 200 serologically different virus types had been implicated in the aetiology of the cold (McChlery, Ramage, & Bagg, 2009, p. 151). In parallel with the identification of viral agents, the public health effort from the latter part of the twentieth century was concentrated on delivering effective vaccines to reduce the prevalence of seasonal and pandemic flu variants \u2013 the most recent global attempt relating to the winter of 2009\u20132010. However, despite the fact that URTI\u2019s have been progressively taken into the laboratory and systematically \u2018Jennerized\u2019 (c.f. Latour, 1988), the main site for their diagnosis is in the community or the world of everyday life. And in that world the understanding of respiratory infections is mediated through a web of concerns \u2013 about the origins and interconnection of symptoms, the maintenance of personal health and the distribution of illness among relatives, friends, and neighbours. This paper focuses on such concerns and in particular how colds and flu are spoken about and diagnosed by lay people in ordinary, everyday, non-clinical settings. The data are drawn from a qualitative interview based study (N = 54) of older people\u2019s understanding and acceptance of seasonal flu vaccine that was undertaken in South Wales during the earlier part of the current decade.",

            "text": "From the work of Stimson and Webb (1975) onward there has been an increasing recognition of the role played by lay people (as patients) in the diagnostic process (see, for example, Beach, 2001, Frankel, 2001, Gill and Maynard, 2006, Gill et al., 2010, Heath, 1992, Per\u00e4kyl\u00e4, 2006). However, the overwhelming majority of relevant studies look at doctor\u2013patient activity in clinical settings \u2013 mostly using techniques of conversation analysis. Interestingly, some of those who research into lay engagement with the diagnostic process argue that the word diagnosis should be reserved solely for categorizations of disease by doctors (e.g., Gill et al., 2010, p. 17). The research reported on here is somewhat different from the work just referred to in that it examines how lay people identify and categorize groups of symptoms in the \u2018lifeworld\u2019 (Mishler, 1984, p. 104), or the world \u2018grounded\u2019 in everyday life, rather than the world of the clinic or the consulting room. In the context of common respiratory symptoms, it is also worth noting that there has been a long tradition of looking at the ways in which lay people understand the symptomatology of URTI\u2019s, and especially \u2018colds\u2019 (see, for example, ; Baer et al., 2008, Baer et al., 1999, Helman, 1978, McCombie, 1987). However, most of that work examines the range of symptoms lay people associate with cold \u2013 and to a lesser extent flu - and how they explain respiratory illness. Such studies are not overly concerned with how lay people differentiate between or how they diagnose colds and flu \u2013 a topic that is the focus of this paper.",

While in policy terms, the topic connects to a growing \u2018acknowledgment\u2019\u2013 especially with regard to chronic conditions \u2013 of patient expertise in health care and the ways in which such expertise can be drawn upon in the delivery of services to the public at large (Donaldson, 2003, Lindsay and Vrijhoef, 2009, Rogers et al., 2009, Wilson, 1999).

Respondents were selected from a previous age-stratified random postal survey of people in the area aged over 65 who had reported on their immunization status.

In our case, for example, that style led the research participants to talk about the causes of upper respiratory tract infections in general and not merely the causes of flu.

There are various advantages of using such automated text-mining techniques for data analysis. One offshoot is that the data set can be trawled for instances of co-occurrence between two concepts (such as flu jab and side-effects). The programme in use is capable of calculating a coefficient for all such co-occurring concepts and can display the results of such connections diagrammatically. Following the exclusion of terms with fewer than 5 citations, the programme identified some 119 concepts (flu, flu jab, side-effects, colds, etc) in our data set. The coefficients of co-occurrence between these concepts naturally varied in strength. In some cases the strength of the links was unsurprising (e.g. the co-occurrence coefficient for the link between cold and flu was unity since the two terms occurred in all interviews); in other cases the link was considerably weaker (e.g. the link between \u2018virus\u2019 and flu was only 0.15).",

These data form the basis for the information displayed in Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n. Unfortunately, text-mining software uses the document (interview) as the basis for all its calculations and so it is not immediately clear whether the interviewer or the interviewee makes the connections between concepts. In our case we have restricted ourselves to looking at explicit links made only by the respondents, and for that reason we have extracted the text-mining results and re-incorporated them into semantic networks using social network software (De Nooy, Mrvar, & Batagelj, 2005) rather than the original text-mining software. Our focus is of course more on the concept networks than on social networks, and the figures provide a graphic indication of the nature and strength of the co-occurrence relationships between the basic terms and concepts in the 54 interviews.",

Unsurprisingly, and as is also evident in Fig. 1, the nose (and sneezing) is particularly prominent in the symptom pattern for cold, though associated sites such as the sinus, the throat and the eyes also figure in the diagnostic frame. This is in marked contrast to flu which is invariably viewed as a whole body illness \u2013 characterized by whole \u2018bodyache\u2019 (Fig.1). Interestingly, a number of respondents also referred (usually in a dismissive manner) to a third category of illness \u2018the sniffles\u2019 \u2013 which seemed to relate to very mild forms of rhinorrhea and associated nasal symptoms. The following data extracts illustrate some of the key ways in which lay people differentiate colds from flu.(R:24) \u201cWell, flu, you get all your aches and pains. You feel lethargic, that type of thing, but with a cold, it\u2019s usually a head cold and plenty of coughs, sneezes and such like that you don\u2019t always get with the flu. I feel the flu is more in the whole of the body\u2026\u201d(R:30) \u201cAlways the question is, I mean my daughters about 44 but I said, um, is your body aching all over? Yes, or no? \u2018Yes\u2019. You\u2019ve got flu then. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019ve got a heavy cold and that\u2019s it.\u201d(R:23) \u201cWell, I think with flu you\u2019re aching all over aren\u2019t you, you go, you get hot and then you get cold and you\u2019re aching all over whereas if it\u2019s a cold you\u2019re sneezing. You have a sort of a heady cold. I think it\u2019s a big difference isn\u2019t there?\u201d(R:7) \u201cWell. Well the influenza usually affects your stomach. It usually affects aching all over the body. And, you usually have a higher temperature. You feel a lot worse with flu, obviously\u201d.\n",

However, there are important differences to note. For example, members of the sample reported on here associated \u2018fever\u2019 with cold as well as with flu, and a number of people associated vomiting with flu (though not with cold). Other populations \u2013 such as Latin American populations - do not seemingly associate gastric symptoms with respiratory disease. More importantly, perhaps, it seems that the ways in which members of our sample integrated the symptom pattern into an understanding of cold and flu is quite different from that which appears in professional medical discourse. In particular, lay people place a heavy emphasis on behavioural correlates as distinguishing features of flu \u2013 being bedridden and therefore unable to function normally is exclusively associated with flu and constitutes a defining feature of flu. There is no consistent reference to causative agents here as a means of demarcating cold from flu. Furthermore it is clear that flu is interpreted as a whole body illness characterized by an aching body (rather than just aching muscles) while colds are mainly confined to the head \u2013 head cold. It is not merely that in cases of flu people suffer with aching muscles (and of course they do), but that they, as homo totus, are ill. In medical anthropology the concept of a whole body illness is far from unknown. However, such illnesses are usually spoken of in the context of culture-bound syndromes and disorders with psychiatric symptoms. They are also reported on almost exclusively in studies of people living in countries outside of the advanced industrial world - see, for example, Oths (1999) study of \u2018debilidad\u2019. Yet from the talk of informants in our study it seems plausible to suggest that, among this group of older white English speaking people at least, \u2018the flu\u2019 is essentially regarded as a whole body illness in which psychological symptoms (feeling low or down) play a very minor role (None of the respondents associated feeling low or feeling down with colds).",

The concept of \u2018folk flu\u2019 was a particular focus for McCombie (1987), who placed a heavy emphasis on references to vomiting and diarrhea as symptoms of folk flu, and argued that such beliefs hampered the investigation of outbreaks of food-borne diseases.
