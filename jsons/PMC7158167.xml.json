Today, water quality standards are usually limited by aquatic life considerations. For example, the primary drinking water standard for zinc is 5 mg l\u2212 1, while concentrations of zinc as low as 0.001 mg l\u2212 1 may be toxic to aquatic life. The implications of this difference are obvious as the cost to protect aquatic life may be much greater than that for satisfying water quality standards for drinking water. It should be noted that the cost of removal of a contaminant increases considerably when the percentage of removal increases. From the technical standpoint, water can be made as pure as desired; however, from the practical perspective, the cost of achieving a given purity must be considered.",

The USEPA has defined a list of 126 toxic organic and inorganic chemicals that appear as specific limitations in discharge permits. These are identified as priority pollutants and can be found on the USEPA website www.epa.gov. Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) such as benzene and toluene may result in public health problems and must be controlled under Clean Air Act legislation. The refractory organics are of particular concern because of the potential long-term cumulative effects of these materials in drinking water and the food chain. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) also requires the USEPA to list unregulated contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and may require regulation in the future. This list is called the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) and is updated every five years and can be found on the USEPA website. The EPA uses the CCL to prioritize research efforts in order to make informed regulatory decisions about specific chemicals. The agency determines whether or not to regulate at least five chemicals on the CCL with each publication cycle. Newer organic pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have received increasing attention over the last decade. This is because of their wide distribution in surface waters, groundwater, and wastewater effluents, and their effects on the development of a variety of aquatic species, the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens, and possible effects on human health. Regulations for a number of these newer pollutants are currently being evaluated by the EPA. Some are currently banned in the United States and the European Union.",

            "text": "Physical pollutants include color, turbidity, temperature, suspended solids, foam, and radioactivity. Although color is not necessarily harmful, it may be aesthetically unacceptable for drinking water and some industrial uses. Color is often caused by organic colloids, thus making its removal expensive. Color may be the result of natural decay of vegetative organics such as fluvic and humic acids. These can react with free chlorine to form Trihalomethanes (THMs) which are of public health concern in drinking waters. Temperature is an important factor in biological activity and significantly affects chemical, biological, and physical reactions. It may also act synergistically with toxic materials, for example, heavy metal toxicity increases with increasing temperature. Turbidity is caused by colloidal material and/or suspended solids, and its removal requires coagulation and filtration. Suspended solids, which may cause turbidity, can result from wastewater discharges or from natural processes, such as erosion. This may inhibit photosynthesis by reducing light penetration, decrease benthic organism activity by covering the water bottom with sediment, and interfere with fish activity by clogging their gills. Solids may be organic or inorganic. Dissolved solids tend to increase in concentration with reuse. In most cases these are difficult and expensive to remove. Foam resulting from surface active agents may cause aesthetic problems, but developments by the detergent industry have minimized these effects. Surface active agents also may cause a reduction in the rate of oxygen gas transfer into the water. Radioactivity may be the result of fallout, natural sources, or waste discharges and can be incorporated into sludges or biological life or dissolved in the water. Because of the unique effects of radioactive substances, they must be controlled at the source.",

Important industrial waste parameters that are of significance to a given industry are defined by a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) grouping. Wastewater characterization and effluent discharge requirements under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit system are based on SIC classifications. The strength and volume of industrial wastewaters are usually defined in terms of units of production (i.e., gal bbl\u2212 1 beer and lb BOD bbl\u2212 1 beer for a brewery) and variation in characteristics and flow by statistical distribution. Industrial waste of organic nature can be correlated to municipal waste loadings by the use of population equivalents. Typically 0.17 lb BOD per capita per day is generated for domestic wastewaters. Assuming an industry generates 17 000 lb BOD per day, then this would be equivalent to a population of 100 000 people. Because of the inherent variability in industrial waste characteristics, treatability studies are often necessary to determine design parameters and potential pretreatment requirements.",

Primary clarification also acts as a barrier for oil and grease to prevent operational problems during subsequent treatment. Since solids will be collected at the bottom of the settling tank, provision must be made for their removal. This is usually accomplished by utilizing a continuous belt device as shown in Figure 3\n. The solids (sludge) are then pumped from the sludge hopper to a sludge digester or other sludge treatment unit process. Note that the secondary sedimentation tank follows biological treatment. As shown in Figure 3, it differs from the primary tank because the provision for scum removal will generally not be required. Additionally, in place of a belt conveyor, a vacuum draw-off is often employed to remove solids quickly for activated sludge applications. It should be noted that chemicals are sometimes added prior to settling to enhance solids removal. The efficiency of solids removal for both primary and secondary clarification is a function of the overflow rate (gal ft\u2212 2 day) which is essentially the velocity of the liquid exiting the tank. The settling velocity of the solids must be greater than the overflow rate if removal is to be effective. Liquid retention time must also be sufficient for efficient solids separation.

Typically, air is introduced, either in the form of bubbles through diffusers or by turbulent agitation of the liquid by an impeller. In some cases pure oxygen is used in place of air. The microbe concentration is maintained in the tank by returning a certain portion of the sludge that passes through the tank and is settled out in a secondary sedimentation basin.

Retention times may be 24 h or longer for extended aeration package plants. With the activated sludge process, it is possible to obtain removals of BOD on the order of 95% or greater with a higher quality effluent than with most other biological oxidation processes. Many modifications of the activated sludge process exist, including a high-rate process where the food to-microorganism ratio is high, thus producing more sludge, typically used for pretreatment; a step-aeration process, where the influent is added at intervals along the aeration tank; tapered aeration, where the introduction of air is varied along the length of the tank, the higher concentration being at the influent point of the tank; and the contact stabilization process, where a portion of the sludge is aerated separately, thus adding flexibility to the process. Most conventional activated sludge basins treating municipal wastewaters are designed for plug flow to minimize hydraulic retention time and optimize settling properties of the floc. In a true plug flow unit all particles entering the reactor stay for an equal amount of time. This of course is not possible in practice. However, plug flow can be approached by dividing the aeration tank into a series of reactors. With complete-mix reactors the incoming wastewater is completely mixed with the reactor contents upon entry. Because of its ability to absorb shock loadings and reduce toxic/inhibitory constituents by dilution to below threshold levels it is often used for treating industrial wastewaters. With the increasing need for nutrient removal staged reactors are often used with combinations of anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic cells incorporating internal recycle for both phosphorus and nitrogen biological removal.",

Following pretreatment and sedimentation the wastewater is distributed from rotary nozzles over the bed, which usually consists of coarse, rough, hard material that gives support to the biological film. The organics in the wastewater are oxidized after assimilation by the bacteria. Periodically, the film will become so thick that it can no longer be supported on the medium and will slough off and be discharged into the effluent from the filter. This sludge will then go to the secondary settling tank and be removed with that from the primary settling tank. The trickling filtration process is said to be advantageous because it can provide good performance with a minimum of skilled operator attention and use less energy. However, the process is highly temperature dependent and will not always perform in accord with the requirements of present-day regulatory agencies. Other variables affecting performance include the organic and hydraulic loading rates and the biodegradability of the wastewater. While effluent quality is less than that from the activated sludge process, quality can be enhanced by following the trickling filter with a biological contactor. The contactor is usually designed for a retention time of 15 min and a solids content similar to that maintained in the activated sludge process. For the treatment of industrial wastewaters, a trickling filter is considered a pretreatment process usually designed to remove approximately 50% of the BOD.

The discharge from such a tank usually flows into a designed drain field and ultimately into the groundwater and/or surface water. A well-designed drainage system into a suitable soil is mandatory since the septic tank itself acts only as a settler and its discharge remains high in soluble organic and microbial contaminants.

As wastewater containing solids is passed through this type of filter, the solids will accumulate and eventually clog up the openings causing high head loss and/or poor effluent quality. Thus, some provision must be made to remove the collected material. The procedure usually followed is to backwash the sand, that is, to reverse the flow, usually with air scour, so that the sand is suspended and the lighter material is washed away. It should be noted that subsequent to a backwashing operation, the sand will settle according to size and thus become stratified, with the smaller particles at the top. Since these particles will filter out most of the solid material, it may be concluded that the entire depth of a sand bed is not utilized in a filtration process. To alleviate this problem, a multimedia filter is employed, involving different filtration materials, each having a different specific gravity. Materials commonly used are sand, coal, and garnet, as shown in Figure. 16\n. This type of filter extends the length of the filtration runs and demonstrates high efficiency.

It can be contacted with wastewater either as a very fine powder or as granules. Since the powdered form is not conducive to column operation, granular activated carbon is used most frequently in advanced wastewater treatment plants. As the wastewater passes through the bed and the constituents from the wastewater are adsorbed onto the carbon, the sites available for adsorption will be exhausted and the bed must be replaced. The replacement can either be by new activated carbon material or by thermal regeneration of the exhausted bed. The sorption capacity of regenerated carbon however may be reduced as compared to the virgin material. In large plants, regeneration by high temperatures is usually practiced.

The process takes advantage of the ability of certain natural and synthetic materials to exchange an ion contained in the material for another contained in the water passing through it. For example, if water containing calcium ions is passed through an ion-exchange medium that preferred calcium ions instead of the sodium ions that were already attached to it, the calcium ions will adhere to the exchange medium and the sodium ions would pass out into the effluent. The higher valence, higher molecular weight constituents replace the lesser ones. As with adsorption on carbon, if a solution containing an ion to be removed is continuously applied to the ion-exchange medium, the medium will eventually become exhausted. It may then be subjected to a process called regeneration, where the exchange medium is converted back to its original state by passing a concentrated solution of the original replaced ion through it. There are many modifications and combinations of ion-exchange units that have been used in both water and wastewater treatment technology. It should be noted that it is possible to recover material from an ion-exchange unit that might be economically advantageous.

The reclaimed water is used for parks, golf courses, industrial processes, commercial uses, and residences. The St. Petersburg dual water system approach has allowed the city to meet the demand from a 10% population increase without increasing supplies.

The original plant treated 15 MGD of activated sludge effluent using, reverse osmosis to treat part of the effluent to satisfy a 500 mg l\u2212 1 TDS maximum requirement because of limitations imposed. The water was then injected into four aquifers to form a seawater intrusion barrier. Before injection, the water was blended 2:1 with well water from a deep non-contaminated aquifer. The water could then flow to the ocean or to augment the potable water supply, or in both directions. The water produced from the treatment plant had no measurable viruses, non-detectable coliform organisms, and an average turbidity of 0.22 TU. Continuing monitoring showed the treatment process removed potential contaminants to non-detect levels for drinking water. Epidemiological studies showed no measurable adverse health effects in the populations ingesting the reclaimed water. It must be recognized that the reclaimed water was diluted with non-contaminated water and had time in the aquifer for natural purification. This facility was recently demolished to make room for a new Groundwater Replenishment (GWR) system. The system opened in 2008 at a cost of $480 million to build and $29 million a year to operate. This enhancement was necessary due to increased population growth, salt water intrusion due to over pumping from the ground water aquifer, the on going chronic drought, and the increased cost of importing water from Northern California. The treatment train consist of filter screens followed by microfiltration. Reverse osmosis is next and the effluent is disinfected using UV light with hydrogen peroxide, About 70 MGD of water is produced. Approximately half filters through the soil into deep aquifers. The rest is injected into the Orange County seawater barrier to prevent ocean seawater intrusion.",
