The disease presents a respiratory form, including coughing, nasal discharge and conjunctivitis. Signs can range from mild to severe, depending on the presence of secondary bacterial pneumonia, with the development of dyspnea. In the absence of bacterial pneumonia, recovery generally occurs 4\u20135 days after the onset of signs. Because virus latency is a normal sequel to BoHV-1 infection, and antibody (Ab) response after infection seems to be life-lasting, any seropositive animal should be considered as a potential carrier and intermittent shedder of the virus, with the exception of young calves with passive maternal Ab and non-infected cattle vaccinated with killed vaccines [1].",

In Argentina, due to regulatory restrictions, only killed vaccines can be used to prevent viral diseases in cattle. Several conventional combined inactivated vaccines containing BoHV-1 together with other viruses (bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) and bacterial pathogens (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus sommi, Moraxella bovis, Moraxella ovis, Campylobacter fetus-fetus, Campylobacter fetus-venerealis and Leptospira sp.) have been used for many decades in routine vaccination protocols to prevent bovine respiratory and reproductive diseases in cattle. These multivalent vaccines were designed to control a sanitary problem of complex etiology. However, the potency and efficacy against each antigen contained in some of these combined formulations is unclear and further studies need to be carried out to properly address this issue.",

A BoHV-1 vaccine must prevent the development of severe clinical signs and markedly reduce virus shedding after experimental challenge. Bovine trials are cumbersome, expensive and time consuming, particularly, in countries like Argentina, where BoHV-1, as well as other viral infections are endemic [10], [12], [13]. The difficulty in finding seronegative bovines, from BoHV-1 free herds, to be used in vaccine potency tests, pose the need for the developing standardized and harmonized tests in laboratory animals. The availability of a laboratory animal model would enable the regulatory authority and vaccine manufacturers to carry out batch-to-batch release tests on a routine basis in a less time consuming and less expensive way.",

Vaccination trials were conducted in 12 beef farms located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Herds without previous history of vaccination against BoHV-1 were selected. As BoHV-1 infection is endemic in Argentina, vaccines were evaluated in BoHV-1 seronegative animals from BoHV-1 free herds, and also in seronegative and seropositive calves from BoHV-1 endemic herds, in order to consider the variability of the real target population [1], [19]. In the trials conducted in BoHV-1 endemic farms, the number of positive and negative animals was randomly distributed in each treatment group so as to initiate the study with statistically similar pre-vaccination mean Ab titers and variances among groups. In every trial, bovines were vaccinated with two doses of vaccine, 30 days apart, as recommended in the label of each of the 22 commercial vaccines tested. Vaccines were administered by the subcutaneal route with doses of 5 or 3 ml according to manufacturer\u015b recommendations. Vaccine formulated for model validation and named as \u201creference vaccines\u201d were applied following same time intervals and dose volumes as commercial vaccines. Blood samples for serum extraction were collected by puncture of the jugular or coccygeal vein. Animals were sampled at 0, 30 and 60 days post-vaccination (dpv). Control groups included placebo and non-vaccinated animals. Groups of calves that received two doses of placebo formulated with culture media (without virus) emulsified in oil-adjuvant were assayed in eight occasions including the dose\u2013response trials in which the animals were sampled until 90 dpv. In addition, in order to have vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups exposed to similar natural conditions, a group of non-vaccinated calves was included in every bovine trial conducted in each of the 12 farms that participated in this study. A bovine trial was only considered valid and included in the statistical analysis if no seroconversion was detected in the non-vaccinated and placebo control groups. Most experiments were carried out blinded (veterinarian, laboratory technician). Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody titer for both ELISA and VN.",

After various preliminary assays, using different vaccination routes, dose volume and intervals between doses (data not shown), the immunization protocol was standardized as follows: a minimum of 5 guinea pigs were vaccinated with two doses of vaccine, 21 days apart, by the intramuscular route, in the hind-leg. The volume of the dose administered to the guinea pigs, corresponded to 1/5 of the volume of the dose given to bovines [20]. For the dose\u2013response study serum samples were obtained at 0, 30 and 60 dpv in order to obtain the kinetic of the Ab response in the lab animal model. For concordance studies guinea pigs were sampled at 0 and 30 dpv. Blood extraction was conducted by cardiac puncture under anesthesia, following ECVAM recommendations for animal welfare [21]. The protocol was approved by the CICV y A, INTA Ethical Committee (CICUAE).

Briefly, bovine and guinea pig serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min. Four replicates of serial 4-fold dilutions of each sample (1:4 to 1:1024) prepared in 96 well plates were mixed with an equal volume of the BoHV-1 reference strain Los Angeles, containing tissue culture infectious doses 50% (TCID50), and leading to a final neutralization stage 1:8 to 1:2048 [9]. An extra sample replicate without virus was used to evaluate the potential toxicity of the serum on the cells. Positive and negative control sera of known Ab titer to BoHV-1 were also included in each assay as internal reference controls. Bovine reference samples were derived from naturally infected, vaccinated and experimentally challenged calves, as previously described [22], [23]. Guinea pig reference samples were obtained from naturally seronegative and vaccined animals, as detailed elsewhere [24]. Serum\u2013virus mixtures were incubated during 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then, 100 \u03bcl of Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell suspension containing between 200,000 \u00b1 50,000 cells was added. After 3 days incubation at 37 \u00b0C, plates were read microscopically for cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE). The test was considered valid if checking back titration of virus gave an infectious titer of 100 (TCID50) with an acceptance range of 50\u2013200 TCID50. The positive control should give its expected titer \u00b1 1SD, the negative serum should give no neutralization (monolayer with CPE) and the monolayer of control cells (cells plus culture medium, without serum and without virus) should be intact. Virus neutralizing Ab titers were calculated by Reed and Muench method [25]. Negative serum samples received the arbitrary value of 0.30 for calculation purposes.",

The antibody titer of each sample was expressed as the log10 of the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with a corrected optical density OD405c (OD405 in the positive coated wells minus OD405 in the negative coated wells) greater than the cut off values of the assay (40% PP for both species). ELISA results were normalized by expressing the corrected OD values as the percentage of a single high-positive control serum (PP%) included in each plate, in every ELISA run.

Virus infection was measured by the duration and peak titer of virus shed in nasal swabs [23] and also represented by the \u201carea under the curve of infection\u201d (AUCi) obtained by plotting the infectious titer of virus shed for 14 days after challenge.

            "text": "Specifically for BoHV-1 killed vaccines, international regulatory policies [1], [11] recommend to evaluate vaccine quality in a potency test conducted in seronegative bovine calves. Briefly, the first batch of virus inactivated BoHV-1 vaccine should be tested in five calves susceptible to IBR infection (negative for neutralizing antibodies to BoHV-1). Calves are vaccinated following the manufacturer's recommendations (typically 2 doses, 30 days apart), while three animals should be left as non-vaccinated controls. Fourteen days after the second dose of vaccine at least 4 out of 5 vaccinated calves should develop virus neutralizing Ab titers of 1:8 or higher. Vaccines not reaching this potency requirement should undergo a challenge test by intranasal route. Two out of three control calves should develop hyperthermia and clinical signs of IBR, while only one of the vaccinated calves may develop clinical signs, otherwise the vaccine batch is considered of poor quality [11]. After experimental challenge, the OIE also requests the vaccine to reduce nasal virus shedding at least 100 times and virus excretion period in 3 days compared to control calves [1]. Thus, for the release to the market, a BoHV-1 vaccine must prevent the development of severe clinical signs and markedly reduce virus shedding after experimental challenge. Tests conducted in calves are expensive and time consuming to be used as a routine test for vaccine batch release, more so in countries like Argentina and other South American countries like Brazil and Uruguay where BoHV-1 and 5 infections are endemic [4], [6], [7], [10], [12]. In such regions finding seronegative bovines from BoHV-1 free herds, is becoming increasingly difficult. The use of a serologic test in guinea pigs, naturally seronegative for the BoHV-1 and 5, represents a convenient alternative method to evaluate batch-to-batch vaccine potency, which is in alignment with the 3R initiative of refining, reducing and replacing animal experimentation [15], [16].",

The quadratic term of the mathematical equation obtained by linear regression analysis reflected the kinetic of antibody response, indicating that above certain Ab titer the Ab response can not be improved by the addition of higher doses of antigen [40]. The guinea pig model was able to significantly discriminate between vaccines formulated with Ag concentrations differing in 1 log10 and showed very good repeatability and reproducibility as recommended by the international guidelines [19]. It is important to highlight that the choice to test vaccines formulated with BoHV-1 antigen concentrations differing in 10-fold scale was based on preliminary data which indicated that no discrimination was observed between vaccine formulations having antigen concentrations within the same order of magnitude. This observation might be related to the fact that the infectious titer of the virus antigens used in the vaccine formulation as well as the virus used in the VN assay are conducted using 10-fold dilutions [38].",

In this case a failure in the guinea pig immunization was verified, since the same vaccine re-tested twelve months later was properly classified as \u201csatisfactory\u201d by both species and both techniques. On the basis of this incident it was decided to include a reference vaccine in every immunization test as a positive control in every guinea pig immunization for full validation and transference of the model. The classification of a vaccine as \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cvery satisfactory\u201d when it is actually unsatisfactory and fails to protect cattle represents a risk for the livestock producers. This kind of misclassification occurred in two cases only by VN and it was due to a technical error (a laboratory mistake in a given VN run) Again, for these special cases the use of both techniques (ELISA and VN) allows to clarify the source of discrepancy.",

From the obtained results we concluded that the developed guinea pig model is a reliable tool to estimate batch-to-batch vaccine potency, avoiding the problem of finding BoHV-1 seronegative bovines in endemic countries, reducing the variability that can be found in bovines and significantly reducing the cost and the duration of the test. The model is also ethically compliant with the refinement, reduction and replacement principle in the use of animals, that can also take part in the new consistency approach [15], [16], [43].",
