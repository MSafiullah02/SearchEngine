Nevertheless, there are some pitfalls that should be kept in mind when working with premanufactured kits. The protocols and reagents have been formulated to work on the prototype tissue used by the manufacturer and may not be as effective on the actual tissues tested because of laboratories\u2019 different fixation and processing protocols, all of which may have adverse effects on the results. Adjustments in the recommended protocol are necessary to optimize the kits in each individual laboratory, which effectively means that the kits must be customized, and any changes made in the manufacturer's protocol require that the entire staining procedure be revalidated by the performing laboratory.1 This procedure may be complicated by the fact that many of the working dilutions of the reagents supplied are already at the critical level of sensitivity.",

The theoretical advantages of these systems over manual staining techniques include improved reproducibility, facilitation of interlaboratory comparisons, reduced reagent expenses, and increased technician productivity. Automation does not mitigate the need to thoroughly validate each step of the staining procedure or the need to evaluate every reagent used to ensure high-quality, consistent results. The same quality control issues that apply to manual staining apply to automated systems. As with manual staining, it is important that a complete reevaluation be performed if there is any departure from the validated protocol.1 Automation does not guarantee an optimal result. Finally, automation cannot replace the pathologist, who must choose the appropriate antibodies and then interpret the final result.",

Current systems, including the Automated Cellular Imaging System II (ACIS II Clarient, Aliso Viejo, Calif), have the ability to assess marker positivity in terms of both percentage positive and intensity of staining. The ability to quantify markers more precisely is especially important in the identification of targets of therapy. One example of this is Her-2/neu. When Her-2/neu protein expression by immunohistochemistry was compared with gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization using routine manual methods and the assistance of a digital microscope, both accuracy and reliability were improved when the digital microscope was used.7., 7a. Precise quantification of hormone receptors may also be important because there is evidence that in patients with high levels of hormone receptors, the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy has a deleterious effect on outcome.8., 9. Another exciting development in the field of automated cellular imaging is spectral imaging. This technology allows multiple markers to be assessed on the same slide\u2014even on a single cell. Computer software can isolate a single chromogen from other chromogens present based on its emission spectrum. Automated cellular imaging provides greater objectivity and reproducibility and thus minimizes interobserver discrepancies.",

Negative, weak, or uninterpretable results should lead to a repetition of the test after the use of antigen retrieval.11., 12. One measure of antigen preservation is to test for expression of the intermediate filament vimentin, a fixation-sensitive protein that is typically expressed by vascular or connective components; this technique often serves as an internal indicator of the conservation or loss of antigenicity.11 Test results may also be affected by technical artifacts and by the nature of the tissue under study. For instance, if tumor cells are crushed, false-positive or nonspecific staining may be encountered. Nonviable areas of tissue from a necrotic tumor may also be a source of false-positive results, attributable in part to leakage of serum proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins). The subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity is critical to the interpretation of immunohistochemical results. For example, Her-2/neu shows membranous staining, whereas antibodies to estrogen and progesterone receptors produce nuclear staining. When unexpected staining patterns are observed with an antibody, the results should be discounted.1 To interpret the results effectively, the pathologist must have extensive knowledge of the staining patterns of the primary antibodies under consideration, including a detailed knowledge of tissue specificity and subcellular localization of the antigen, and an awareness of technical variables. Each laboratory performing immunohistochemical staining should have established written criteria for determining and reporting positive and negative findings for each immunohistochemical stain, with particular reference to stains that are expected to produce cell surface membrane, cytoplasmic nuclear, or extracellular staining. Although it seems obvious, it often is overlooked that staining should be recorded as positive only if it occurs in the expected cellular or tissue location.",

This cross-linking interferes with the antigen's ability to react with the primary antibody. In 1991 the antigen retrieval technique was developed.12., 18. This technique is a heat-induced modification of the protein conformation that allows the antigen to be accessible again for chemical reactions, in this case, antibody binding. Hydrolysis of cross-linking resulting from formalin fixation probably plays a major role in this modification process.19., 20., 21., 22. The application of antigen retrieval to sections derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks produces consistent results of acceptable quality,6 although a few antigens remain undetectable even after antigen retrieval has been performed. Antigen retrieval methods have revolutionized immunohistochemistry and have become a standard part of diagnostic immunohistochemistry in surgical pathology. These methods result in higher sensitivity and more consistent antibody reactivity. Antigen retrieval technology has led to a proliferation of protocols that may produce different results in different laboratories. The successful application of these methods allows the detection of some antigens that were previously undetectable in paraffin sections, rendering much of the early literature (prior to 1993) obsolete. This fact continues to escape the notice of some practicing pathologists, leading to errors of interpretation (Fig. 5-1\n).",

            "text": "It should be recognized that two major factors influence the effectiveness of antigen retrieval: the conditions under which heating takes place, and the pH value of the buffer solution used during the heating process.5., 11., 23. The most critical factor is the combination of the temperature and the duration of heating, which have a reverse correlation. Based on these two factors (heating conditions and buffer pH), a test battery approach has been developed to establish optimal antigen retrieval protocols for immunostaining on archival paraffin-embedded tissue sections.1., 6., 23. A typical test battery consists of nine serial sections of a specimen known to express the antigen under study. The sections are evaluated with buffer at three different pH values (e.g., pH 1 to 2, 7 to 8, and 10 to 11) and three heating conditions (e.g., 90\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C, and 120\u00b0C) for various lengths of time (or some other comparable heating versus time schedule). The best result is selected as the optimal retrieval condition for that antigen. In the event that a satisfactory result is not obtained, other variations may be explored, including different buffer solutions and more or less vigorous heating methods.19., 23. Protocols for antigen retrieval differ in their effectiveness for retrieving certain antigens, and a single universally effective retrieval method does not exist. Many laboratories use more than one method for different antibody and antigen combinations. Overall, citrate buffer at pH 6.0 has the broadest applicability for the widest range of antigens, although several studies have demonstrated that the use of higher pH retrieval solutions yields satisfactory results.21., 24. Retrieval solutions with lower pH values, TRIS (tromethamine) buffer at pH 8.0, and EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)-NaOH solution (pH 8.0), are effective in certain special situations.25., 26., 27. The selection of heating method (water bath, steamer, microwave, pressure cooker, or autoclave) is influenced by custom and availability.",

The results of a single immunohistochemical procedure can be misleading not only because of variables in the staining procedure but also because of unanticipated patterns of reactivity of certain antibodies.1 Although myriad antibodies are available, the choice in a particular case should be judicious and designed to address the diagnostic possibilities. The use of too few antibodies rarely provides sufficient information to support a specific diagnosis and can produce misleading information. Antibodies should be selected on the basis of their ability to affirm or exclude considerations in the differential diagnosis. This so-called problem-oriented approach is based on the selection of appropriate panels of antibodies. When selecting antibodies, factors that should be considered include the clinical history, morphologic features of the tumor, and results of other tests that may have been performed, including serologic and radiographic tests. Pathologists can find guidance in the literature and in a few specialized textbooks that address the use of immunohistochemistry,2., 29. but this is a rapidly evolving field. The limited antibody panels of a few years ago are inadequate to deal with tumors of unknown or uncertain primary sites today. With this in mind, the panels presented here must be considered elementary guides.",

The more poorly differentiated a tumor is, the less likely it is to express tissue differentiation antigens. There is often staining variation within a tumor; by extension, variations in staining patterns may be seen between the primary tumor and the metastatic focus. Most important, the final diagnosis should never depend on immunohistochemistry alone; it must be made using all the clinical, serologic, radiographic, morphologic, and epidemiologic data available. Other techniques, such as the assessment of specific DNA alterations, are becoming increasingly important adjuncts to the pathologic evaluation.

Carcinomas usually express cytokeratin; sarcomas, melanomas, and lymphomas are generally vimentin positive; myogenic tumors are characteristically positive for desmin or muscle actins and vimentin; and glial tumors are predominantly positive for GFAP.1 Some tumors characteristically coexpress more than one intermediate filament (e.g., renal and thyroid carcinomas contain keratin and often vimentin), whereas others show aberrant or no intermediate filament expression. Immunohistochemical markers for intermediate filaments on tumors of uncertain origin are one of the most useful and productive ways to begin classifying the lesion. Anaplastic neoplasms can be characterized as keratin positive (carcinomas, mesotheliomas), vimentin positive (sarcomas, lymphomas, melanomas), or neurofilament and GFAP positive (neuroendocrine, neural, and astrocytic tumors).1\n",

Low-molecular-weight or nonsquamous keratins appear early in development and predominate in tumors derived from simple, nonstratified epithelium (e.g., ductal carcinoma of the breast, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma). High-molecular-weight or squamous keratins appear in more complex stratified epithelium and predominate in tumors derived from stratified epithelium (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma). Some tumors, such as those derived from pseudostratified columnar epithelium, contain a mixture of high- and low-molecular-weight keratins, with a predominance of the latter. In some instances, especially in extremely poorly differentiated tumors, as few as 5% of tumor cells may express keratin reactivity.1\n",

This presents a problem when, for example, a patient with a prior history of breast carcinoma presents with a lung mass that, on biopsy, is adenocarcinoma. Determining whether the lung mass represents a primary pulmonary tumor or metastasis from the breast has enormous consequences in terms of patient outcome and choice of specific treatment. Although the immunohistochemical evaluation of primary epithelial tumors is problematic, advances have been made. Monoclonal antibodies against keratin subtypes may help determine the origin of certain poorly differentiated neoplasms. Hepatocellular carcinoma (positive for AE3 and CAM 5.2 but negative for AE1) can be distinguished from bile duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver (positive for AE1).33 In particular, the differential expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 (CK7, CK20) is extremely useful in the characterization of epithelial neoplasms (Fig. 5-3\n).32., 34., 35., 36.

A proportion of patients with no evidence of systemic dissemination as evaluated by routine methods (careful pathologic, clinical, biochemical, and radiologic evaluation) develop recurrent disease. In addition, the success of adjuvant therapy is assumed to stem from its ability to eradicate occult metastases before they become clinically evident.99 Immunohistochemistry is commonly used to identify occult metastatic cancer cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes of patients with cancer. Although many of the initial studies focused on breast cancer,100., 101., 102. tumors from other organs such as the stomach,103., 104. colon,105., 106. prostate,107., 108. lung,109., 110. nervous system,111 and skin112 have been investigated. Immunohistochemical methods are based on the ability of monoclonal antibodies to distinguish between cells of different histogenesis (e.g., epithelial cancer cells versus the hematopoietic and stromal cells of the bone marrow and lymph nodes). The results indicate that it is possible to identify occult metastatic cancer cells in lymph nodes and bone marrow before their detection by other methods and that the presence of these cells may be an important risk factor for disease recurrence (Fig. 5-8\n).",

            "text": "A potentially more sensitive approach for the detection of occult metastasis is the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, which has been applied to several malignancies using a variety of marker transcripts as targets. Since the first study by Smith and colleagues in 1991,114 many authors have reported molecular diagnoses in the lymph nodes, blood, and bone marrow in cancer patients.42., 107., 115., 116., 117., 118., 119. Application of RT-PCR in regional and sentinel lymph nodes has been described for a number of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, and cancers of the prostate, breast, and lung.118., 120., 121., 122., 123., 124. Many of these compare immunocytochemical-based detection with RT-PCR for sensitivity and conclude that RT-PCR may achieve enhanced detection, provided the target markers are sufficiently specific. Various formats of RT-PCR assays125., 126., 127. have also been used to detect disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with cancers of the breast, colon, and lung, among others. With the exception of some organ-specific markers such as maspin or mammaglobin for breast cancer116., 128. or uroplakins for urothelial tumors,129 most of the molecular targets used in these RT-PCR assays lack the requisite specificity owing to illegitimate expression in nontarget hematopoietic cells.130., 131., 132. Unlike immunohistochemistry, morphologic confirmation of the cells in question to verify tumor origin is not possible with RT-PCR. RT-PCR has also been used to enhance the sensitivity of the detection of tumor cells in the peripheral blood in a variety of cancers, including prostate, breast, gastrointestinal tract, colorectal, and head and neck cancers and melanoma.117., 133., 134., 135. Concerns about nonspecificity owing to illegitimate transcription of target genes in the nontarget hematopoietic cells also apply to the blood, which has hampered the use of these assays in routine clinical diagnosis.",

Several studies have addressed the clinical significance of these early metastatic cells in the bone marrow, including a pooled analysis of more than 4700 patients.143 They have found that the presence of such cells is an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival and overall survival.144., 145., 146. Occult metastases in the bone marrow are also prognostically important in other malignancies, including primary non\u2013small cell lung cancer,109., 110., 147., 148. esophageal and gastric cancers,103 colorectal cancer,149 and neuroblastoma.111 The finding of positive cells in the bone marrow of patients with colorectal cancer\u2014a tumor that rarely shows overt metastasis to the bone\u2014indicates that this may be a general indicator of tumor dissemination. In addition, the prognostic significance of occult metastatic cells in the blood is under investigation.",

            "text": "Studies undertaken to detect occult lymph node metastases by routine histologic methods have generally been performed by cutting serial sections from all paraffin blocks containing lymph nodes, followed by routine staining and microscopic review.163 Several studies simply reviewed the original histologic slides. Newer studies involve cytokeratin immunohistochemistry on one or more lymph node sections. PSA immunohistochemistry has also been used to confirm the prostatic origin of cytokeratin-positive cells in the lymph nodes of patients with prostate cancer.108 All these studies have shown that deposits of tumor can be detected using these methods. In previously determined node-negative cases of breast cancer, 7% to 33% convert to node-positive status after review. Neville and colleagues164 found the mean conversion rate to be approximately 13%. Although virtually all studies have shown that lymph node metastases can be overlooked, there has been surprising disagreement about the prognostic importance of these occult tumor deposits.165., 166., 167. However, it is now widely accepted that the detection of occult lymph node metastases is an important predictor of outcome in patients with histologically node-negative cancer.168., 169., 170. In a key study (Ludwig Trial V), occult breast cancer metastases were detected by immunohistochemistry in 20% of patients and were associated with significantly poor disease-free and overall survival in postmenopausal patients but not in premenopausal patients.168 Additional studies in patients with breast cancer found occult lymph node metastases to be predictive of a poorer outcome.169., 170. Studies in patients with lung,171., 172. prostate,107., 108. and colorectal 173., 174. cancer suggest that occult metastases in the lymph nodes in these patients may also predict a worse prognosis.",

            "text": "Although Her-2/neu overexpression and amplification have been described in several tumor systems, it has been studied most extensively in the breast. Her-2/neu overexpression occurs in 10% to 34% of primary breast carcinomas187 and is restricted to cancer cells. There is an inverse association between Her-2/neu amplification and the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Her-2/neu overexpression is also associated with high-grade tumors176., 188. and is considered an adverse prognostic indictor in patients with breast cancer.187 The presence of Her-2/neu overexpression is associated with resistance to tamoxifen therapy189., 190., 191. and to CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) adjuvant chemotherapy but is associated with an increased response to regimens that use high-dose doxorubicin.192., 193., 194., 195. Recent studies have linked amplification of the Her-2/neu and topoisomerase II\u03b1 genes to the effects of anthracyclines. Preliminary data suggest that coamplification of these two genes may identify a subgroup of high-risk breast cancer patients who might benefit from individually tailored and dose-escalated adjuvant anthracyclines.196., 197. Her-2/neu can also be assessed through amplification of the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization.",

EGFR is known to be involved in carcinogenic processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell motility, and metastasis. The expression of EGFR has been examined in a wide variety of tissues, and in many cases, increased expression of EGFR is predictive of tumor progression (e.g., cancer of the breast, esophagus, adrenals, lung, bladder, thyroid, and gastrointestinal tract and glioblastoma multiforme).198., 199., 200., 201., 202., 203., 204., 205.

Its normal function is to prevent the replication of damaged DNA; it does so by preventing cell replication by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor E2F.209., 210. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is activated when it is dephosphorylated and inactivated when it is phosphorylated. Alterations in this gene have been described in many human tumors, including retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, other sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas, and certain carcinomas, including breast, lung, prostate, bladder, kidney, and testicular carcinoma.29., 211., 212. Gene alterations are associated with advanced tumor grade and stage in a variety of tumors.211., 213. Alterations in the Rb gene correlate with loss of expression of pRb as determined by immunohistochemistry.214 Assessment of Rb gene loss by immunohistochemistry is based on the loss of detectable nuclear staining for pRb. There is growing evidence that gene alterations may identify tumors that have a higher risk of developing metastases.215 Loss of heterozygosity, mutations, or deletions of the Rb gene usually result in the loss of pRb expression, which has been regarded as an indicator of loss of pRb function in human tumors. In addition to loss of pRb expression, aberrantly high pRb expression indicates a loss of pRb function in bladder tumors compared with moderate pRb expression.210., 215. It has been shown that tumors with pRb overexpression demonstrate pRb hyperphosphorylation, mediated in part by the loss of p16 expression or overexpression of cyclin D1.210\n",

Because of the importance of p53 alterations in human cancer and the ease of detecting p53 mutations by molecular or immunohistochemical methods, p53 alterations have been the focus of intense examination. As with Rb alterations, p53 alterations are associated with tumors of high histologic grade and a high proliferative index.

Accurate methods for determining the presence or absence of hormone receptors are essential for determining the best method of treatment.",

Immunohistochemical antireceptor assays allow one to predict breast cancer's response to hormonal treatment.245., 246. Tumors that do not express estrogen or progesterone receptors have a low probability of responding to hormonal manipulation, whereas estrogen receptor\u2013 and progesterone receptor\u2013positive tumors have a high probability of responding to such treatment. Many practitioners believe that the only relevant result for hormone receptors in breast cancer is \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201d However, some investigators have shown that the level of hormone receptor is important as well.8., 9. Although a proportion of patients with low levels of hormone receptor will respond to hormone therapy, most benefit from the addition of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. In contrast, in patients with high levels of hormone receptor, the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy has a deleterious effect on outcome.8., 9.\n",

This view is based on a body of evidence showing that wild-type p53 is required for entrance into the apoptotic pathway at the G1- to S-phase transition.248., 249. Because chemotherapy works through the induction of apoptosis, p53 alterations may result in resistance to such agents. We are conducting a clinical trial concerning the role of p53 in predicting progression and response in patients with bladder cancer.250 It is also possible that p53 may promote chemoresistance by other mechanisms, such as through induction of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene.249., 251. In tumors in which p53 alterations confer increased (selective) chemosensitivity, combining agents that have different actions (e.g., DNA damage versus inhibition of the G2M checkpoint) may have synergistic effects on tumor cell killing, a finding that has important implications in the design of new combination chemotherapy regimens.252\n",
