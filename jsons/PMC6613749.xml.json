            "text": "The family Arteriviridae, which belongs to the order Nidovirales, consists of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and the recently identified wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV) (1, 2). Of these arteriviruses, EAV and PRRSV are considered to be significant etiological agents in the field of veterinary research due to the economic losses that they cause in the equine- and swine-breeding industries worldwide (3). Stallions are susceptible to EAV infection; persistently infected stallions can infect and cause abortion in pregnant mares via their semen (4\u20136), and foals infected with EAV often suffer from fatal bronchointerstitial pneumonia or pneumoenteric syndrome (7). EAV is capable of persisting in the reproductive tract despite the presence of local mucosal antibodies and inflammatory responses (8). PRRSV infection presents as severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs (9). As arteriviruses, EAV and PRRSV share some similar molecular properties, such as their replication strategy, capacity for establishing persistent infection, and ease of transmission from infected animals to naive animals (10, 11). These viral characteristics cause the corresponding diseases to be difficult to control. Currently available drugs and vaccines confer insufficient protection against these diseases (12, 13), so it is important to find a suitable strategy to prevent arterivirus proliferation in the host.",

            "text": "Arteriviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes of 12 to 16 kb in size (14). The arterivirus genome consists of 10 to 12 known functional open reading frames (ORFs) (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3 to ORF7, ORF5a, and a transframe fusion [TF] ORF) (15). ORFs 1a and 1b, located in the 5\u2032 three-quarters of the arterivirus genome, encode two long nonstructural precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (16). These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins (nsp\u2019s) by ORF1a-encoded proteases (17). In EAV, ORF1a contains three proteases, two cysteine proteases located in nsp1 and nsp2 and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease in nsp4, which are involved in releasing the nsp1 to nsp3 and nsp3 to nsp12 proteins from pp1a/ab (18\u201320). nsp1 and nsp2 are involved in cleavage at the nsp1/2 and nsp2/3 sites, whereas nsp4 is responsible for cleavage of the remaining nsp\u2019s (21). The nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, and nsp4 proteins of PRRSV are responsible for its self-cleavage processing (22, 23). Arterivirus nsp4 plays a significant role in the processing of pp1a and pp1ab for nonstructural proteins that direct genome replication and subgenomic mRNA (sg-mRNA) synthesis. Due to its indispensable role in viral replication, arterivirus nsp4 is an appealing target for antiviral drugs.",

Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2 (LGP2), which belong to the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family, serve as the main pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for recognizing viral RNA (26). After sensing cytoplasmic viral RNA, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by host PRRs. Subsequently, the PRRs interact with the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (also known as IPS-1/VISA/Cardif) and further recruit a bridging adaptor molecule, NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), which is responsible for the recruitment of TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), to further activate the IKK complex. As a result, the activated IKK complex leads to the phosphorylation and activation of NF-\u03baB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which directly induce IFN production (27, 28).",

            "text": "Given the pivotal role of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway in IFN signaling, it is not surprising that viruses evolve strategies that target crucial molecular signaling by the viral protease to suppress IFN production. Previous work demonstrated that coronavirus (CoV) 3CL protease (3CLpro) and picornavirus-encoded 3C proteases (3Cpro) possess characteristics that suppress IFN-\u03b2 production (29\u201332). Recent studies showed that PRRSV nsp4 could block NF-\u03baB signaling to inhibit IFN production (33). Because infection with EAV could suppress IFN production, and viral 3CLpro and 3Cpro have been identified as IFN antagonists, here, we investigated the role of EAV 3CLpro (encoded by nsp4) in regulating the IFN response. Our results clearly demonstrated that EAV nsp4 impairs RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by cleaving the crucial adaptor molecule NEMO at multiple sites. We identified EAV nsp4 cleavage sites within NEMO and revealed that the final cleavage products were severely impaired for IFN signaling. Unlike PRRSV nsp4, EAV nsp4 can also cleave NEMO by identifying glutamine (Q) at the P1 position, the first amino acid on the left side of the recognition site. The above-described results reveal a comprehensive mechanism by which EAV nsp4 antagonizes type I IFN signaling and identify a novel substrate recognition characteristic of EAV nsp4.",

To investigate the function of EAV nsp4 in type I IFN signaling, we constructed an expression vector encoding nsp4 of EAV and determined the impact of its ectopic expression on Sendai virus (SEV)-induced IFN synthesis. Various concentrations of the EAV nsp4 expression plasmid and the IFN-\u03b2 luciferase (IFN-\u03b2-Luc) reporter plasmid were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, EAV nsp4 strongly inhibited the SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data confirm the antagonistic property of EAV nsp4 in type I IFN signaling.",

Our results demonstrated that these five molecules significantly activated the IFN-\u03b2 promoter compared with the empty vector control, and EAV nsp4 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter by RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, or NEMO-K277A, which is a constitutively active NEMO mutant (Fig. 2A). However, the TBK1-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter was not affected by EAV nsp4 (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that EAV nsp4 inhibits RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by targeting a molecule upstream of TBK1.",

Previous research revealed that PRRSV nsp4 cleaves NEMO at glutamate 349 (E349) to produce a single faster-migrating protein band (33). To further compare the NEMO cleavage mediated by different members of the family Arteriviridae, EAV nsp4 or PRRSV nsp4 expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells along with NEMO expression plasmids. Western blotting of the resulting cell lysates demonstrated that the size of the smallest-migrating protein band in EAV nsp4-mediated cleavage was similar to that in PRRSV nsp4-mediated cleavage. Interestingly, two new smaller bands (\u223c17 kDa in size) in the NEMO/PRRSV nsp4 coexpression samples were detected, and these two bands seemed to share a cleavage site similar to the one observed in the NEMO/EAV nsp4 coexpression samples (Fig. 3A). Only NEMO E349 has been previously reported to be cleaved by PRRSV nsp4 (28), so we further transfected different doses of PRRSV nsp4 into HEK293T cells along with NEMO. The results showed that two new smaller bands (\u223c17 kDa in size) were present in a PRRSV nsp4 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that PRRSV nsp4 can cleave two residues near the N terminus of NEMO in addition to the reported cleavage residue E349. Thus, our results indicate that both the EAV and PRRSV nsp4 proteins possess the ability to cleave multiple sites of NEMO.",

The results from experiments using the two truncation mutants NEMO(1\u2013189) and NEMO(1\u2013216) showed that the cleavage position of the unidentified fourth cleavage product was located between residues 189 and 216 (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). However, E210 is the only E residue present among these residues, and a mutation in NEMO residue E210 did not affect the presence of the fourth cleavage product from EAV nsp4-mediated cleavage (Fig. 5A). These findings suggest that a nonclassical residue in the P1 position can be cleaved by EAV nsp4. Thus, we further analyzed the substrate specificity of EAV nsp4 in viral polyproteins from different EAV strains. The resulting data reveal that EAV nsp4 exhibits a high degree of preference for Glu (E) at the P1 position but that it also recognizes Q residues, even though the preference for them is quite low (Fig. 5B).",

            "text": "RIG-I-like receptor-mediated type I IFN production plays an important role in defending the host against virus invasion (34). However, during coevolution with their host, viruses always evolve a variety of strategies to escape and even inhibit host IFN responses (36, 37). Of these strategies, the cleavage of crucial signal molecules by a main viral protease is considered to be a particularly effective way for virus to escape the innate immune response (38, 39). For example, 3C proteases (3Cpro) of coxsackievirus A16, coxsackievirus A6, and enterovirus D68, which belong to the family Picornaviridae, can inhibit NF-\u03baB activation by cleaving transforming growth factor \u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) (29). Additionally, coxsackievirus B and hepatitis C virus disrupt RIG-I/MDA5 signaling through the cleavage of MAVS by 3Cpro or NS3-4A proteases (39, 40). Here, we verified that, similarly to PRRSV nsp4, EAV nsp4 could also serve as an IFN antagonist by targeting the crucial adaptor molecule NEMO. Surprisingly, we found that catalytically inactive EAV nsp4 mutants retained slight inhibition of SEV-induced IFN production. Previous studies also reported that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp5, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) nsp5, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3Cpro mutants deprived of protease activity still retain weak inhibition of SEV-induced IFN production (31, 41, 42). It is well known that the protease-substrate interaction is the first step in the proteolytic activity of proteases. Catalytically inactive mutants of viral proteases, such as PEDV nsp5 (43) and FMDV 3Cpro (44), which lose their proteolytic activities, could form a complex with substrates. We speculate that the association between enzyme-inactive mutants and NEMO could contribute to the slight ability of catalytically inactive EAV nsp4 mutants to inhibit IFN induction. However, compared with the overexpression of wild-type EAV nsp4, the repression of SEV-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation was strongly relieved with the overexpression of H39A, D65A, and S120A mutants. Thus, the proteolytic activity of EAV nsp4 is involved in suppressing IFN-\u03b2 production.",

However, we found here that the cleavage fragment NEMO(1\u2013349) still activates IFN production (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we additionally evaluated whether NEMO(1\u2013349) could active the NF-\u03baB promoter. The results showed that the cleavage fragment yielded by cleaving NEMO at E349 could also activate the NF-\u03baB promoter compared with NEMO-K277A (data not shown). Together, the above-described data indicate that NEMO(1\u2013349) shows a stronger ability for IFN activation than full-length NEMO. Previous work and the data shown in Fig. 2A verify that both EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 inhibit NEMO-mediated IFN activation (33), indicating that PRRSV nsp4 and EAV nsp4 each might fail to completely block only the NEMO-mediated IFN-\u03b2 activation that occurs through cleavage at NEMO E349.",

Similar situations were also reported in work on Seneca Valley virus (SVV)-mediated MAVS, Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), and TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK) cleavage (45). Although SVV 3Cpro could cleave MAVS, TRIF, and TANK, the corresponding cleavage products were not detected during SVV infection (45). Although we failed to detect the endogenous cleavage products of NEMO in PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) or in EAV-infected Marc-145 cells, we observed a degradation of the NEMO protein abundance following viral infection. Thus, we speculate that the NEMO cleavage products may be short-lived during EAV or PRRSV infection. Initially, we would like to know whether arterivirus nsp4 is sufficient for endogenous NEMO degradation during EAV and PRRSV infection by reverse-genetics methods. However, the catalytically inactive mutants of EAV or PRRSV (EAV nsp4-H39A, -D65A, and -S120A and PRRSV nsp4-H39A, -D64A, and -S118A in our study) could not be rescued, and a possible cause is that the catalytically inactive nsp4 mutation also loses the ability to cleave the polyprotein of EAV or PRRSV. Future investigations to identify some mutants of nsp4 that abolish the ability to cleave NEMO but do not affect the ability to cleave the virus-encoded polyprotein will be required.",

However, there is an exclusive site at Q205 for EAV-mediated NEMO cleavage, demonstrating that EAV nsp4 adopts a distinct substrate recognition characteristic for the P1 position targeting NEMO. A similar occurrence has been reported for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and SVV 3Cpro-mediated TANK cleavages. Both EMCV and SVV belong to the family Picornaviridae, and although their 3Cpro proteins target TANK at a common residue, Q291, SVV also cleaves TANK at another site, E272 (45, 46). Additional studies should be conducted to determine which part of the 3Cpro or 3C-like proteases leads to this difference in cleavage sites. Both arteriviruses and coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales. Previous work showed that nsp5 proteins from PEDV and PDCoV, members of the family Coronaviridae, cleave NEMO at a common residue, Q231 (31, 41). Our research group has verified that another coronavirus nsp5 could target NEMO at Q205 or Q231 (data not shown). However, EAV nsp4 can also cleave NEMO at Q205. This finding suggests that EAV nsp4 is closer to coronavirus nsp5 in evolution than PRRSV nsp4. Whether the evolutionary relationship between these viruses led to their different specific sites of NEMO cleavage by these 3C-like proteases should be studied further.",

Crystal structures revealed that the nsp4 proteins of PRRSV and EAV each contain three domains, including two chymotrypsin-like \u03b2-barrel domains and an extra C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2-domain, mirroring a conserved structure in arterivirus nsp4 (3, 35). Additionally, recent work showed that coronavirus nsp5 proteins, which have highly conserved structures, exhibit a common P1-Q preference for substrate specificity. However, we found here that the nsp4 proteins of EAV and PRRSV, both of which belong to the family Arteriviridae, showed different preferences for substrate specificity: EAV nsp4 demonstrates a preference for Glu (E) and Gln (Q) at the P1 position to target NEMO, whereas PRRSV nsp4 prefers to recognize only Glu (E). To explore which part(s) of nsp4 causes these different recognition characteristics, we constructed two homology models for EAV and PRRSV nsp4 in complex with the same substrate, KASCQE\u2193SARIE (Fig. 8B and C).",

The results showed that the S1 pocket of EAV nsp4 consisted of three residues, His134, Ser137, and Thr115, whereas only two corresponding residues, His133 and Ser136, were found in PRRSV nsp4; thus, the conformation of the S1 pocket differs between EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 (Fig. 8D and E). Additionally, Thr113 in PRRSV nsp4 is conserved with Thr115 in EAV nsp4, but Thr113 did not interact with P1 in the complex structure (Fig. 8A and E). Our data are similar to those from a previous study on the structure of arterivirus nsp4 (35). Therefore, we speculate that the different conformations of the S1 pockets of EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 may lead to P1 being able to accommodate different amino acids. However, the structure of arterivirus nsp4 in complex with substrates remains unclear. Our findings provide a suitable substrate, i.e., NEMO, for further studies on the structure of the arterivirus nsp4 complex.

It has been reported that NEMO-activated IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 can lead to TBK1/IKK\u03b5 activation by IKK\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated TBK1/IKK\u03b5 phosphorylation (47). NEMO deubiquitinylation impairs NF-\u03baB activation (48, 49). A series of NEMO mutations (E391X, H413R, A323P, and Q157P) was reported to abrogate NF-\u03baB activation, verifying that NEMO is a core component in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway (50). Different viruses can disrupt IFN signaling through interaction with NEMO or NEMO-interacting partners. According to previous studies on NEMO, the N-terminal region of NEMO is responsible for interactions with IKKs, and its C terminus interacts with upstream signaling adaptors and leads to the activation of IKKs (51). A recent study showed that p.DelQ134-R256, a truncated NEMO mutant that lacks the coiled-coil 1 (CC1) and helix-loop-helix 2 (HLX2) regions, could inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling (52). PEDV and PDCoV 3CLpro proteins target NEMO at Q231 to divide it into two fragments, thereby disrupting NEMO downstream activity (31, 41). E166, E171, and Q205 are located within coil-coiled domains of NEMO; we verified that the cleavage fragments generated from targeting these three NEMO sites have lost the ability to induce IFN production (Fig. 6B and C). This finding indicates that the coil-coiled domains are indispensable for NEMO-induced IFN signaling.",

Both EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 induced NEMO cleavage at the conserved residues E166, E171, and E349, whereas only EAV nsp4 could target NEMO at site Q205. Importantly, cleavage of NEMO by PRRSV or EAV nsp4 led to suppression of the type I IFN signaling pathway. Our research provides deeper insights into strategies by which arterivirus nsp4 escapes the host immune response.",
