The SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for entry into host cells. The virus can attack organs with high ACE2 expression such as the heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract in addition to the lungs. Acute myocardial injury is common among patients with COVID-19, and fulminant myocarditis and even sudden cardiac death are not rare. Recent studies found that patients with myocardial injury in hospitalization had a significantly higher inhospital mortality rate than those without myocardial injury (1), (2) . However, it is still unclear if myocardial injury at the time of admission indicating early cardiac involvement is also a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19.",

All patients had been diagnosed with COVID-19 by both nucleic acid testing and chest CT scanning. Patients who died or were discharged between Jan 28, 2020 and Mar 16, 2020 were included in our study. According to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 7.0) (3), the discharge criteria is that patients have no fever for at least 3 days, significant relief of respiratory symptoms and improvement on chest CT, and had negative SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test twice in succession. Acute myocardial injury is defined as elevation of Troponin I (TnI) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (4). This study was approved In summary, our cohort study demonstrated that acute myocardial injury at admission was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19, which highlighted the importance of closely monitoring changes of myocardial enzymes, cardiac rhythm and cardiac functions, and thus providing timely interventions, especially when using drugs against SARS-CoV-2 with potential cardiotoxicity, such as chloroquine and lopinavirritonavir. Further studies are urgently needed to confirm the findings and explore the pathogenesis of myocardial injury in COVID-19. with acute myocardial injury at admission had a higher risk of all-cause death than those without acute myocardial injury at admission. P values were calculated by the log-rank test.",

            "text": "by the Research Ethics Commission of the Central Hospital of Wuhan, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 179 patients were enrolled, and 176 patients (116 survivors, 60 non-survivors) with TnI tests at admission were included in the current study. Median age was 67 (IQR 57-73) years, and 57.39% patients were male. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=87 [49.43%]), diabetes (n=47 [26.70%]), hyperlipidemia (n=30 [17.05%]), coronary heart disease (n=25 [14.20%]) and cerebrovascular disease (n=24 [13.64%]). No patients had myocardial infarction or heart failure within one month before admission. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, had a higher proportion of comorbidities, including hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and pulmonary diseases, had worse disease severity status, and had a higher proportion of acute myocardial injury on admission (58.33% vs 12.07%).Among the 60 non-survivors, 25 (41.67%) with myocardial injury at admission died of circulatory failure or both respiratory failure and circulatory failure. Kaplan-Meier curves showed acute myocardial injury at admission increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 (Figure 1). We included 169 patients in multivariable binary logistic regression models. After adjusting for sex, age, fever, severity status, comorbidities, background use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, pulse, fasting plasma glucose, creatinine, white blood cell, neutrophil, platelet count, albumin, and glucocorticoids treatment, the regression models showed that acute myocardial injury significantly increased the death risk (Crude OR = 10.20, 95% CI: 4.78-21.78, p < 0.0001; Adjusted OR = 6.93, 95% CI: 1.83-26.22, p = 0.0044). The stratified-analyses also showed the results of the aforementioned associations remained robust according to baseline characteristics.",
