While at first glance this strategy is appealing, the research to date has demonstrated only that similar test lungs and pharmacologically paralyzed sheep with normal lungs can be ventilated by this approach. Perhaps this strategy would have utility for ventilating patients with normal lungs (eg, isolated traumatic brain injury) and thereby free additional ventilators for patients with high resistance or low compliance. Extrapolation to EMCC would require pharmacologically paralyzed patients who remain matched for minute ventilation requirements, dynamic airflow resistance, and compliance throughout the duration of ventilation; however, these parameters are likely to vary during the duration of mechanical ventilation, and may even change over a period of minutes (eg, secretions causing increased airflow obstruction). Because the Task Force anticipates that most additional patients requiring mechanical ventilation during a mass critical care event will have severe airflow obstruction or lung injury21 and will require days of ventilatory support, the Task Force suggests that each patient should have his or her own mechanical ventilator.",

Sophisticated mechanical ventilators offer significant advantages over manual ventilators, especially when PPV augmentation will be required for more than several hours. Major benefits include the ability to deliver consistent and appropriate minute ventilation, to conserve oxygen and staff stamina, and (because of alarms that alert staff to unsafe patient-ventilator interactions) to allow health professionals to perform other medical functions, thus reducing the required time at bedside.",

However, the initial purchase and ongoing maintenance costs will likely prohibit most hospitals from having their own stockpile to meet their entire EMCC capacity goal. Therefore, short-term strategies to augment PPV capacity until equipment from outside agencies arrives are encouraged. Anesthesia machines may be repurposed as ventilators (although some surgeries may have to be deferred), as may noninvasive PPV (NIPPV) equipment capable of providing volume ventilation through an endotracheal tube. These temporary options should not be considered definitive solutions for prolonged, large-scale events, such as an influenza pandemic. At least some anesthesia machines will need to be reassigned for surgeries if the response is longer than several days and there are insufficient quantities of appropriate noninvasive devices at hospitals to handle the quantities of additional patients anticipated for such events.23 When existing hospital PPV equipment\u2014including repurposed anesthesia machines, noninvasive devices, and sophisticated transport ventilators\u2014is not available in sufficient quantities to meet patient needs, then devices from unaffected hospitals or stockpiled PPV equipment should be requested from local, state, and federal stockpiles via the usual resource request channels.24 For most disasters, outside assistance can be expected. For events involving multiple regions or entire nations, outside assistance may be insufficient to meet the mechanical ventilation needs of a local community.",

            "text": "The Task Force does not suggest that each hospital individually purchase all of the PPV equipment necessary to surge to their EMCC capacity goals. Rather, hospitals should work with their local, regional, and state partners to perform a PPV needs analysis for all plausible mass critical care events, such as a severe influenza pandemic. Hospital PPV equipment together with existing caches, such as the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) Strategic National Stockpile ventilator inventory,25 should be evaluated to make sure they are sufficient to meet EMCC capacity goals within reasonable time expectations and assuming multiple hospitals concurrently requesting equipment. For these analyses, hospitals are cautioned against relying solely on rental PPV equipment because multiple hospitals within a region are usually dependent on the same several vendors and the overall rental supply is often limited. Additional nonfederal stockpiles of PPV equipment are appealing because the devices would be expected to more reliably arrive in a timely manner. Also these stockpiles will allow for distribution of one or two ventilator models to affected hospitals, as opposed to piecing together a supply of many makes and models, and will increase likelihood that staff will be able to operate the devices and that necessary device-specific ancillary equipment (eg, ventilator circuits) will be available. If regional analyses demonstrate significant PPV gaps and additional metropolitan, intrastate regional, or state caches are considered, Table 2 provides guidance for surge PPV equipment. Equipment characteristics were based on the following: (1) perceived requirement for adequate, sustained mechanical ventilation; (2) demonstrated effectiveness; (3) ease of use; and (4) minimization of purchase, maintenance, and training costs.",

High-pressure medical gas, which is required by PPV devices without internal compressors, is provided in hospitals as medical air and oxygen. Many patient locations outside of critical care units do not have all of the equipment necessary to deliver either of the high-pressure medical gases to ventilators. Even if medical air is available, PPV devices whose internal oxygen blenders require consistent high-pressure oxygen will be unable to provide supplemental oxygen to patients in treatment spaces that have only low-flow oxygen regulators. Alternatively, the high-pressure equipment may be present, but provision of sufficient oxygen pressure and flow may be compromised as a result of insufficient oxygen on site (limited liquid oxygen volume or failure of oxygen concentrators), interruption of the main supply line to the hospital, or flow limitation of the oxygen piping system of the entire hospital.",

The major vulnerability specific to liquid oxygen is that it is not made at hospitals and therefore requires distribution from manufacturers. Most hospitals have enough liquid oxygen on site to respond to a short-term event without resupply; Charity Hospital in the wake of Hurricane Katrina still had enough liquid oxygen for several additional days at the time of evacuation (Ben Deboisblanc, MD; personal communication; May 2006). Maintaining a medical response, either by hospitals with small oxygen reserves or by most hospitals during a prolonged response, will require resupply of liquid oxygen. Resupply may be unreliable owing to damaged transportation routes or insufficient numbers of available, trained drivers (because of illness or fear) to make oxygen deliveries. Fewer hospitals rely on on-site oxygen concentrators rather than liquid oxygen as their primary gas source. These systems are not dependent on oxygen distribution from off-site manufacturers, but still require a continuous supply of electricity to operate. At most facilities, regardless of their source of oxygen and even with reserve oxygen systems for primary source failure, oxygen intended for the entire facility enters using the same length of pipe.37 If the primary system fails as a result of disruption of this piping connection (eg, earthquake), then the reserve system, if it relies on the same piping external to the hospital, will be ineffectual.",

This has important implications for events when hospitals need to deliver high-flow oxygen from most of their oxygen stations. There may be sufficient bulk oxygen source on site, but the flow of oxygen may become limited in some treatment spaces. For these situations, additional means to deliver oxygen to treatment spaces will be necessary.41 Compressed oxygen, such as the commonly used E cylinder (644 L) or H cylinder (6,900 L) can meet short-term oxygen needs. However, it is logistically difficult to have enough oxygen for many patients provided by compressed gas cylinders. Each patient who uses 4 L/min of oxygen requires 5,760 L of gaseous oxygen per day, nearly an H cylinder per day. Given cost and storage constraints, most hospitals maintain only enough cylinders to cover short-term disruptions of the bulk liquid systems.",

Once the IMCU reaches capacity, patients normally requiring IMCU-level care should be admitted or transferred to hospital wards, which usually provide the next lower level of care. Discharge of general ward patients to home, assisted-living facilities, non-acute nursing facilities, or other community medical surge facilities can allow for enhanced movement of patients from the higher-acuity-level wards to general hospital wards.57 To triple the usual ICU capacity of a US hospital, approximately 40% of total hospital rooms are needed for provision of EMCC (ICU beds constitute approximately 13% of US hospital beds).58 Half as many hospital beds have been made available within a day of previous disasters.59 For events that evolve over several days or weeks, if hospital admissions are prioritized for critically ill people and temporary medical treatment sites are set up to care for less complex patients (eg, those who would normally be awaiting skilled nursing facility placement or home health evaluation or those who are several days from discharge without expectation of clinical worsening), then tripling ICU capacity in terms of treatment space is possible (Fig 2\n). If the mass critical care event is related to an epidemic of a potentially airborne-transmitted pathogen and critically ill patients are feared to be the most likely to transmit the disease, then infection control considerations may warrant prioritizing another hospital ward over those best equipped for critical care. While critical care may need to be delivered on a number of hospital wards, patients with the most complex monitoring or treatment requirements can still be preferentially assigned to traditional ICU locations.

Under these circumstances, therapy would be triaged and the less crucial care processes omitted by necessity. If this strategy is still insufficient to meet need, a critical care respiratory therapist could supervise one to three non-critical care respiratory therapists (RTs). The critical care RT should perform the more complex tasks and be available to supervise the non-critical care RT staff. This supervision will be most needed when the staff is first undertaking simpler tasks, including suctioning of the airway, delivery of aerosolized bronchodilators, and circuit maintenance; after they are observed to competently perform the tasks, the intensity of supervision can be decreased.

This strategy is attractive because it allows for drawing staff from a larger pool of available candidates, and theoretically it would not require recurrent training, which is difficult to sustain for large numbers of health-care workers. Of course, a better option would be to cross-train allied health-care workers recurrently with the materials, and then use the digital video disk also as a refresher during the disaster response.
