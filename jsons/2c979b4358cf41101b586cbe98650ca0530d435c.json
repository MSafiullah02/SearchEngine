The objective was to evaluate, using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), whether children with AHT have a similar neurovascular response to injury compared with children without AHT. Methods Retrospective sub-analysis of previously prospectively acquired data in a pediatric intensive care unit in a level 1 trauma hospital. TCD was performed daily until hospital day 8, discharge, or death. Neurologic outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E Peds) at 1 month from initial injury. Results Sixty-nine children aged 1 day to 17 years with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury were enrolled. Fifteen children suffered AHT and 54 had no suspicion for AHT. Fifteen children with AHT underwent 80 serial TCD examinations; 54 children without AHT underwent 308 exams. After standardization for age and gender normative values, there was no statistically significant difference in mean cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (V MCA ) between children with and without AHT. There was no difference in the incidence of extreme cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, greater or less than 2 standard deviations from normative value) between groups. Within the AHT group, there were no statistically significant differences in V MCA between children with a favorable (GOS-E Peds 1-4) versus unfavorable neurologic outcome (GOS-E Peds 5-8).",

These forces may result in various patterns of brain injury, which often co-exist in the same child: axonal injury, parenchymal injury, skull fractures, and extra-axial hemorrhage [6, 14, 24] . Children with AHT are at risk for hypoxic-ischemic injury due to vascular compromise or asphyxia [18] . Furthermore, children with AHT may often be exposed to repeated injury over time and may have acute, subacute, and chronic injury at the time of presentation. Therefore, given the multiple potential contributors to injury in AHT, it remains unclear if the neurovascular response, including changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) as well as cerebral autoregulation, is different in children with AHT compared with other forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI).",

Following severe TBI, cerebral blood flow may be dysregulated, often having an initial period of hypoperfusion followed by hyperemia [22] . Studies using TCD in children with severe TBI have shown that abnormal CBFV may be associated with poor outcome [11] .

Eighty serial TCD studies were performed in the AHT group, with an average of 5.8 studies/patient. Three hundred six studies were performed in children without AHT, with an average of 5.7 studies/patient. After standardization for gender and age normative values, using a mixed effects model, there was no significant difference in V MCA for children with AHT versus those with non-AHT on a daily basis (p = 0.9265) or averaged across time (p = 0.3405) (Fig. 1) . There was no significant difference in the percentage of extreme CBFV between groups (Table 3 ). There was no significant daily difference in the pulsatility index of the MCA between groups (p = 0.243), nor was there a difference when averaged across time (p = 0.1347). Basilar artery flow was not different between groups (p = 0.6245) when all data points were combined nor when averaged across time (p = 0.5335).",

            "text": "Abusive head trauma kills children worldwide. In the USA wq21 alone, there is a 20% mortality rate for children under 2 years of age [24] . Survivors of AHT are often left with significant morbidity, including motor deficits, visual impairment, AHT, abusive head trauma; non-AHT, non-abusive head trauma; pCO 2 , partial pressure of carbon dioxide; mmHg, millimeters of mercury; C, Celsius cognitive deficits, speech impairment, seizures, and behavioral disorders [15] . In a cohort of 940 children with AHT, 72% had significant long-term disability 5 years after injury [15] . Given the significant impact on both mortality and long-term functioning, it is imperative that clinicians gain a better understanding of the acute cerebral hemodynamics following AHT to evaluate for potential treatment opportunities. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is one modality that provides a non-invasive window into the brain's cerebral hemodynamics. This modality may be helpful to elucidate changes, particularly when there are no invasive modalities used or available. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study to evaluate TCD parameters in a cohort of children with AHT. When evaluating V MCA in children with and without AHT, there was no significant difference in values standardized for age and gender nor in the percentage of extreme CBFV between groups. While not statistically significant, when analyzed by severity of TBI, we did see that within the severe TBI group, children with AHT had lower rates of extreme CBFV compared with the non-AHT cohort. This is in contrast to our hypothesis and warrants further investigation. Children at risk for repetitive injury may have less of a hyperemic response to an acute traumatic event. In a mouse model of repetitive closed-head injury (once daily for 5 days), cerebral blood flow was reduced following injury and did not return to baseline for 72 h [5] . It is unclear how these findings translate to humans, but if similar findings are present, this may be a preliminary explanation for the slight differences seen in extreme CBFV within the severe TBI group.",

Therefore, it remains unclear as to whether our cohort presented with solely acute or acute on chronic head injury. It is unknown whether children with chronic AHT would have similar findings to our cohort. This is an inherent limitation of the field as often when there is suspicion for abuse, interventions are taken to place the child in a safe environment. It may be possible to begin to understand the cerebral hemodynamics of chronic head injury by comparing V MCA in children with acute subdural hemorrhage with those with evidence of both acute and chronic subdural hemorrhage on initial imaging. Children at risk for repetitive head injury, such as athletes with repeated concussions, may serve as an alternative population in which one could further elucidate the longitudinal TCD changes attributed to chronic head injury. In general, the results of this study were in contrast to our hypothesis. When combining THRR and V MCA data, this study suggests that children with AHT have a similar neurovascular response to trauma, as measured by TCD, to children without AHT. However, our study evaluated a cohort of children with both moderate and severe TBIs. To better inform the literature regarding changes in transcranial Doppler ultrasound of children with AHT, a multi-center study would likely be needed, ideally evaluating children with moderate and severe TBIs separately. When evaluating those with severe TBI due to AHT alone, there may be alterations in cerebral hemodynamics that we were unable to fully evaluate in this study. Furthermore, there may be factors outside the neurovascular response to injury, such as a combination of traumatic and asphyxia injury that occur in children with AHT that contribute to their significant and increased morbidity and mortality compared with trauma from other etiologies. One could hypothesize that the significant difference in seizure incidence in our cohort, consistent with prior studies, may suggest that seizure burden may have a significant role in outcome [8] .",

Future studies should further evaluate the acute cerebral hemodynamics in children with AHT in a larger sample size and consider the use of continuous TCD monitoring as it may show individual variability with both V MCA and autoregulation on an hour by hour basis not captured by intermittent monitoring. In addition, we compared children with AHT and a median age of approximately 4 months with children without AHT with a median age of 10 years. Only three children in the non-AHT group were under 2 years of age. We attempted to control for this by standardizing each patient's V MCA data to that expected for a child of similar age, gender, and the presence/absence of invasive mechanical ventilation. Future studies should compare children under 2 years with and without AHT to ensure that age alone does not negate specific changes to the neurovasculature in this population.
