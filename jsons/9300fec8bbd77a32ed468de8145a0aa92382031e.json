Great endeavours made in past 70 years led to significant decrease in morbidity and mortablity caused by several major parasitic diseases, while challenges existed to eliminate parasitic diseases. Surveillance-response system has play a crucial role in identifying public health problems, ascertaining the distribution and epidemic dynamics, discovering outbreaks and epidemic anomalies, evaluating the effects of on-site intervention activities and identifying risk factors. In this article, we reviewed the progress of the surveillance system for parasitic diseases, analysed the role of NIPD in the construction and application of surveillance-response system of parasitic diseases through elaborating the surveillance activities and typical surveillance-response events led by NIPD. Suggestion and comments for improve the surveillance-response system were put forward for further control or elimination of parasitic diseases. (CCDC [2014]420) ",

The purposes of parasitic disease surveillance, specifically, is to monitor the occurrence and development patterns of diseases, provide prompt feedback and analysis of effective information, as well as to respond to and initiate rapid emergency responses (German, 2000; Yang et al., 2012) . Additionally, an early warning consists of an advanced prediction that an epidemic may reach a dangerous level or an epidemic event is going to be occurred (Ameme et al., 2016) . Such warnings are made with respect to a series of epidemic indicators or a possible epidemic event, based on long-term surveillance data and other basic information. It also involves the timely forecasting of development trends regarding an epidemic at a spatiotemporal level and minimizing the harm caused by the spread or occurrence of the epidemic. Alternatively, a response refers to the actions taken by the local government or agency based on the level of early warning, involving the felicitous organization of resources to carry out the emergency response plan, prevent the spread of the epidemic or reduce the extent of harm caused, to ensure the health safety of the population (Perry et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2016) . Therefore, surveillance, early warnings, and responses must be strategically combined, well-coordinated, and enable a collaborative division of labour to improve the sensitivity of the surveillance system, thereby achieving the expected outcome of controlling transmission or spread of parasitic diseases ( Fig. 1) (Tambo et al., 2014) .",

Therefore, surveillance has always been a key aspect for parasitic diseases control in China. Since the establishment of our institute, most notably since it was renamed the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Zhou et al., 2005) , we have gradually established and continuously improved a surveillance-response system for parasitic diseases based on the control stages of key parasitic diseases. This system has played a crucial role in understanding the epidemic dynamics, transmission patterns, and influencing factors of parasitic diseases in China, thereby facilitating the early detection of epidemics and guiding their management; while promoting on-site prevention and control activities (Feng et al., 2016b) . Herein, we review the work carried out by our institute on constructing a national key parasitic disease surveillance network and developing emergency responses to epidemic events. ",

This provided a reliable basis guiding for treating patients and controlling schistosomiasis outbreaks. Since 1990, the Bureau of Disease Control of the former Ministry of Health commissioned the Shanghai Medical University to conduct schistosomiasis surveillance in 14 villages of eight provinces (municipalities), which were enlarged to 21 epidemic surveillance sites from 2000 to 2004. In addition to epidemic indicators, the surveillance content also included epidemiological factors, which provided a scientific basis for understanding the epidemic changes of schistosomiasis in China and evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions (Yuan et al., 2002) .",

However, at that time, limited information was available regarding the prevalence of angiostrongyliasis and the distribution of epidemic foci in China. In light of this, after the epidemic was effectively managed, NIPD, with the support of the former Ministry of Health, organized a systematic national survey pertaining to the epidemic foci of angiostrongyliasis in 2007 and 2008 consecutively (Fig. 5) (Lv et al., 2009 ) to investigate the distribution and diffusion of A. cantonensis as well as its hosts. By clarifying the epidemic foci of this disease, the distribution of intermediate and definitive hosts and their infection status we gained further insights into the public health risks posed by angiostrongyliasis. In 2009, a pilot program for symptom surveillance and early warnings of angiostrongyliasis transmission was launched, which drove the surveillance, prevention, and control of angiostrongyliasis in various regions, thus controlling or decreasing the public health risk caused by angiostrongyliasis.

In the 1970s, surveillance began the next year since the endemic province reached the threshold of basic elimination of filariasis, primarily focusing on the discovery and elimination of residual sources of infection to consolidate the results of prevention and control. In the 1980s, after clarifying the indications for interrupting the transmission of filariasis, longitudinal surveillance was performed to observe dynamic changes of microfilaremia situation in human populations, and to confirm that microfilaremia and natural larval infections could no longer be found in human populations and mosquito vectors (Wang et al., 1998) . By the 1990s, horizontal surveillance, longitudinal surveillance, and surveillance of floating populations were conducted to understand the changes of microfilaremia rates, the transmission trends of filariasis in human populations, as well as the status of microfilaria infections in floating populations and their impact on the elimination of filariasis. These studies provided evidence for the elimination of filariasis within a region (Fang and Zhang, 2019) . In 2001, NIPD participated in the preparation of the Regional Surveillance Program for the Elimination of Filariasis and reviewed the regions that had eliminated filariasis in an effort to continue identifying and monitoring potentially weak links in terms of prevention, control, and surveillance. Since 2004, verification of filariasis elimination based on case reporting was conducted under the technical support of NIPD. Reviewing the history of filariasis surveillance can provide basic information for understanding its distribution in China while also highlighting changes in human infection rates at different stages and consolidating the achievements of filariasis elimination, thus providing a scientific basis for sustained elimination of filariasis in China.",

After reporting to the former Bureau of Disease Control of the Ministry of Health, NIPD provided technical support to local Diseases Control Center for spring interregnum treatment and health education. The Anhui Spring Interregnum Radical Treatment Program was formulated with the support of NIPD, followed by on-site supervision of treatment by NIPD experts. After implementation of effective intervention over two epidemic seasons, the reported number of malaria cases in Anhui Province decreased significantly and malaria was deemed to be effectively controlled (Pan et al., 2012) .",

NIPD also coordinated with local disease control and prevention agencies to carry out symptom surveillance, health education, mosquito and lacewing control, and the promotion of self-protection in disaster areas. These measures prevented the occurrence or outbreaks of major parasitic diseases following the disasters. In addition, during a series of major events such as the Beijing Olympics held in 2008, the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, and the China International Import Expo, emergency preparedness was actively conducted to ensure the success and health safety of these events.",

Further, the parasitic diseases which have been con-trolled continue to face risks of transmission or rebound. With socioeconomic development and increase in tourism, trade exchanges have become more frequent, which implies that there is also a continuous rise in the threat of imported epidemics .
