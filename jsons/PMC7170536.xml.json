In times of normalcy or crisis, smartphones greatly extend the capacity of medical providers\u2014allowing us to simultaneously check labs, review relevant literature, track wound progress, and facilitate instantaneous communication with our care teams and patients. But they travel with us everywhere\u2014in our pocket and lab coat, to the restroom and to patient rooms. Not surprisingly, nearly 100% of healthcare provider mobile phones show growth of bacterial pathogens [1]. Phones swabbed from intensive care settings have shown high rates of multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [2]. Highly pathogenic viral isolates of norovirus, rotavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus are also known to reside on our smartphones. COVID-19 is likely the same, with emerging evidence suggesting that isolates are viable on inanimate surfaces for up to 72 h [3].",

From social media to morning television, lessons on how to properly wash our hands are dusted off and told as new\u2014but these lessons are tried and true. \u201cClean Care is Safer Care\u201d programs have demonstrated significant reductions in healthcare-associated infections and have been endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization. But hands are not our only source for healthcare-associated infection. Inanimate objects, such as stethoscopes, have long been recognized as important vectors for bacterial and viral transmission. While definitively linking contaminated devices to hospital-acquired infections has proved to be difficult, stethoscopes have been shown to harbor pathogenic bacteria and these bacteria have been shown capable of transmission to provider hands and back to patient\u2019s skin [4]. Healthcare workers have been shown to rarely clean their stethoscopes between patients, even though cleaning significantly decreases the bacterial load [5, 6].",

New policy efforts to waive Medicare restrictions on telehealth will pave the way for providers to accelerate adoption of e-visits and other technology-related healthcare interventions, thus creating ever more contact with our smartphones and tablets.

These \u201con the fly\u201d communications often take place at the point of patient care, offering a point of exposure for these connected devices.",
