            "text": "Transposable elements are omnipresent in eukaryotic genomes and have a profound impact on chromosome structure, function and evolution. Their structural and functional diversity is thought to be reasonably well-understood, especially in retroelements, which transpose via an RNA intermediate copied into cDNA by the element-encoded reverse transcriptase, and are characterized by a compact structure. Here, we report a novel type of expandable eukaryotic retroelements, which we call Terminons. These elements can attach to G-rich telomeric repeat overhangs at the chromosome ends, in a process apparently facilitated by complementary C-rich repeats at the 3 0 -end of the RNA template immediately adjacent to a hammerhead ribozyme motif. Terminon units, which can exceed 40 kb in length, display an unusually complex and diverse structure, and can form very long chains, with host genes often captured between units. As the principal polymerizing component, Terminons contain Athena reverse transcriptases previously described in bdelloid rotifers and belonging to the enigmatic group of Penelope-like elements, but can additionally accumulate multiple cooriented ORFs, including DEDDy 3 0 -exonucleases, GDSL esterases/lipases, GIY-YIG-like endonucleases, rolling-circle replication initiator (Rep) proteins, and putatively structural ORFs with coiled-coil motifs and transmembrane domains. The extraordinary length and complexity of Terminons and the high degree of interfamily variability in their ORF content challenge the current views on the structural organization of eukaryotic retroelements, and highlight their possible connections with the viral world and the implications for the elevated frequency of gene transfer.",

            "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are segments of DNA with the ability to relocate within or between genomes, which is conferred by the element-encoded enzymatic functions. Traditionally, TEs are divided into two major classes: class I (retrotransposons) code for a reverse transcriptase (RT) capable of making a cDNA copy of the template RNA, which serves as a transposition intermediate; and class II (DNA TEs) code for a transposase, which can mobilize DNA in the absence of RNA intermediates (Finnegan 1989; Wicker et al. 2007; Kapitonov and Jurka 2008) . Retrotransposons are in turn subdivided into four subclasses: LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which are closely related to retroviruses; nonLTR retrotransposons, also called LINEs; DIRS, or YR-retrotransposons; and Penelope-like elements (PLEs). These subclasses are phylogenetically distinct, and their RTs usually operate together with the respective types of coencoded phosphotransferase/endonuclease (EN) DNAcleaving enzymes: IN (DDE-integrase); APE (apurinic-apyrimidinic EN) or REL (restriction enzyme-like EN); YR (tyrosine recombinase); and GIY-YIG (nickase initially identified in prokaryotic group I introns). It is the concerted action of the RT and the phosphotransferase that determines the retroelement's ability to insert into internal genomic locations. Enzymatically active domains are typically fused into a single polyprotein called pol, which may undergo proteolytic processing or function as a multi-domain protein. Formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle is ensured by the structural ORF1 (gag), which is usually separated from the downstream ORF2 (pol) by a programmed ribosomal frameshift or by inframe stop codons. Downstream of pol, many retrovirus-like TEs have incorporated env genes of various origins coding for envelope glycoproteins responsible for membrane fusion and interaction with cell surface receptors during viral entry and egress. Two families of RT-containing viruses, hepadnaviruses and caulimoviruses (collectively called pararetroviruses), differ from retroviruses in encapsidating their DNA instead of RNA, and do not regularly integrate into chromosomes (Glebe and Bremer 2013; Hohn and Rothnie 2013) .",

Of special interest is the unique group of PLE RTs named Athena (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) . Previously described Athena retroelements are 4-6 kb in length; are phylogenetically distinct from canonical Penelope RTs; do not carry EN domains; and contain stretches of telomeric repeats at the junctions with host DNA. Such EN-deficient RTs are found at or near telomeres in many basidiomycete fungi and in a few plants and protists, but are particularly abundant at telomeres of bdelloid rotifers (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) .",

Genome sequencing of the first bdelloid representative, Adineta vaga, revealed that over 8% of its genes originate from bacteria, fungi, plants, or protists (Flot et al. 2013) . Known TE families make up over 3% of the A. vaga genome, and are characterized by low copy numbers and high family diversity. Recently, we described canonical Penelope retrotransposons from A. vaga, which integrate into internal chromosomal locations with the aid of the C-terminal GIY-YIG EN domain ). Here we investigate Athena-containing retroelements in A. vaga, compare their organization in related species separated by tens of millions of years, and discover that they possess an extraordinarily complex structure not yet described in retroelements. We also uncover the basis for their affinity to telomeres and identify putative cisacting elements that may play a role in mobilizing genes of foreign origin and members of multigene families.",

Most of the computergenerated Athena consensi were represented by RT and some adjacent sequences, but their boundary verification was far from straightforward. Specifically, while the 3 0 boundary, at least in some families, was relatively easy to define from comparison between inserts, the 5 0 boundaries were mostly formed by variably positioned 5 0 -truncations of apparently longer units, which included a variety of ORFs shared by some families but different in others.

Our piRNA libraries, as expected, were highly enriched in known A. vaga TEs (Rodriguez and Arkhipova 2016). Notably, for most Athena RTs, we observed that piRNA coverage extends well beyond the RT ORF ( fig. 1 ). However, inspection of RT flanks did not reveal any sequences that might correspond to adjacent TEs in a piRNA cluster. Instead, the zone of piRNA coverage includes a multitude of densely spaced ORFs, which display the same polarity as Athena RTs, and apparently constitute parts of very large transposable units.",

Indeed, we were unable to find a TE or a host gene interrupted by a Terminon insertion. On the contrary, we observed multiple cases in which part of a preexisting TE or gene was irreversibly lost by truncation, with subsequent addition of telomeric repeats and Terminon attachment (supplementary table S1 and figs. S1A and S6, Supplementary Material online). Remarkably, the added Terminon units can extend telomeres by tens of kb at a time. Such additions can effectively counteract the ongoing terminal erosion, the dynamic nature of which is seen from comparison of the same A. vaga telomere at different points in time: telomere M1 (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) The 3 0 ends of Terminons are often present in higher copy numbers than the 5 0 ends, a pattern observed in nonLTR retrotransposons, which display well-defined 3 0 ends and frequent 5 0 -truncations (Wei et al. 2001; Hayashi et al. 2014) . As seen in supplementary figure S2, Supplementary Material online, intragenomic Terminon replication follows the mastercopy model, whereby shorter copies are derived from the longest resident copy.

Interestingly, Athena RTs from Philodina roseola, a species from the bdelloid family Philodinidae (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) , can be confidently placed into N and W clades defined by RTs from A. vaga (supplementary fig. S3A , Supplementary Material online), indicating that the split between clades predates the divergence of bdelloid families (>60 Mya) (Mark Welch et al. 2008) . Table 1 presents the inventory of A. vaga families, with the scaffold harboring the longest and most intact representative designated as the reference scaffold for each family. Members of each family share common features and display betweenclade variability in the RT ORF structure, manifested in the presence/absence of programmed ribosomal frameshifts, commonly found in retrovirus-like elements; gain and loss of introns; and acquisition of RT derivatives lacking catalytic residues.",

Two variants of the ExoIII motif are known: YX 3 D (DEDYD) and HX 4 D (DEDHD). These exonucleases perform 3 0 -end processing of structured RNAs (RNase D, RNase T, exosome subunit Rrp6), but may also act on singlestranded DNAs (WRN, DnaQ, and proofreading subunits of A-and B-type DNA polymerases). Six of the Terminonencoded exonucleases are of the DEDYD-type, with the second D replaced with E (DEEYD); the remaining three derivatives in L1-L3 families lack the acidic residues, indicating catalytic inactivity. An additional EHCHC motif in all families, which is known to coordinate Zn 2\u00fe binding in Maelstrom proteins involved in piRNA biogenesis (Chen et al. 2015) , suggests conservation of the RNA binding function.

They contain five conserved blocks with a G-D-S-L or similar sequence with the catalytic Ser in the first block, and are also called SGNH hydrolases, after the letters specifying the invariant catalytic S, G, N, and H residues in the conserved blocks I, II, II, and V, respectively. Most members of the L1-L3 families encode these ORFs (table 1) , which are similar to PC-esterases (pfam13839), enzymes predicted to have acyl esterase activity modifying cell-surface biopolymers such as glycans and glycoproteins (Anantharaman and Aravind 2010). However, the hydrolytic function of these ORFs must be impaired, as the Ser residues of the catalytic S-N-H triad are lacking. GDSLesterase-like ORFs in a subset of nonLTR retrotransposons (CR1, RTEX, and BRIDGE1), which differ from PC-esterases, are thought to interact with membrane glycoproteins to facilitate entry or exit (Kapitonov and Jurka 2003; Schneider et al. 2013) , and at least some of them possess hydrolytic activity, while others lack such activity but preserve binding properties (Montanier et al. 2009 ). In the viral world, analogous ORFs encode hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoproteins in ssRNA viruses, for example, orthomyxoviruses (influenza C) and coronaviruses (Zeng et al. 2008) .

In the catalytically dead JVX clade, it displays a high content of acidic residues (D and E) at the N-termini, and weak matches to BAR domains sensing membrane curvature (pfam03114). In the intron-rich, catalytically intact NT and W clades, it carries a conserved N-terminal KR-rich motif with an adjacent region of weak homology to helix-turn-helix dsDNA-binding motifs, while the central core occasionally shows similarity to DnaJ chaperones and surface antigens . While ORF1's and CC-ORFs do not resemble classical orthoretroviral gag genes and lack Zn-knuckles, they are reminiscent of the gag genes forming nucleocapsids in foamy viruses (Spumaretrovirinae), which are similarly sized, do not undergo proteolytic processing, and contain up to four coiled-coil motifs (Goldstone et al. 2013; Mullers 2013) . A combination of KR-rich and DE-rich N-termini in cooccurring CC-ORFs is highly likely to affect RNP properties, and might aid in raising the limits on RNA packaging.",

Some of these ORFs also contain a predicted coiled-coil motif and/or cysteine residues which may form disulfide bridges. The low conservation of TM-ORFs offers limited insight into their function other than possible interaction with membranes. We searched for HHR motifs in A. vaga genomic DNA with the parameters used in (Cervera and De la Pena 2014), which were based on empirical criteria and tested on datasets of functionally active HHRs. A total of 497 HHR motifs fitting these descriptors were detected in A. vaga scaffolds, and assigned to M, O, W1, N, Q, R, S, and T families. Inspection of the remaining families revealed the essential core motifs (CUGANGA. . .GAAA) in the L and W families, albeit with a slightly different spacing (a much longer loop 2) ( fig. 3A ). When we modified the descriptor to accommodate these families, HHR-like motifs were detected in all PLE families, except for K, W2, and P. However, all members of the K, W2, and P families contain substitutions in the core HHR motif, although the sequence can easily be aligned with other HHRs and apparently preserves the structural helices ( (L\u00fcnse et al. 2016) , the AvPen3a HHR functions as a monomer.",

These fragments can now be reliably assigned to W, K, and N Terminon clades. To evaluate the degree of Terminon conservation in bdelloids, we inspected sequenced cosmid inserts from P. roseola, as well as Athenacontaining contigs from a draft PacBio assembly of a natural isolate Adineta sp.11. In P. roseola, Terminons are joined to host DNA via a different telomeric repeat hexamer (TCACCC) n while in Adineta sp. 11 junctions are mostly formed by a variant octamer (TCACACCC) n . Strikingly, ORF composition and even syntenic blocks have been preserved in several families, and thus can be traced back to their common ancestor. For example, the extended ORF block in the S/T family, which includes the catalytically dead AthX and AthV (GIY-YIG, DEDDy, AthX, AthV, 2xGIY-YIG, CC JVX , AthT, aORF; supplementary fig. S6C , Supplementary Material online), appears in both Adineta spp., which diverged over 10 Mya, and phylogenetic analysis of Terminon ORFs confirms the presence of virtually every described family throughout each species' evolutionary history (supplementary fig. S3 , Supplementary Material online). Although nonRT Terminon-associated ORFs are shorter and less conserved than RTs, yielding less reliable branch support, their phylogeny is broadly congruent with the RT-based phylogeny, indicating that these ORFs have largely coevolved within each Terminon family (supplementary figs. S3B and S7, Supplementary Material online). The apparent exception is the Rep-related ORFs, for which a discordant phylogeny hints at the more transient character of their association with Terminons, albeit sufficiently prolonged to allow intron accumulation ( fig. 3C ). Overall, while the prevailing mode of inheritance for each Terminon family appears to be vertical, they may also persist within genera and species via horizontal mobility if a master copy is lost.",

Together with fluorescent in situ hybridization data localizing AthO/AthM-containing cosmids to P. roseola telomeres (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) , our analysis underscores the capacity of Terminons to occupy terminal positions, forming multiple layers of \"sacrificial DNA\" at telomeres.",

            "text": "For years, our knowledge of structural and functional TE diversity has remained relatively stable, with the understanding that we have largely grasped the major principles of their structural organization and the underlying basis for their mobility. It is therefore of special interest to identify taxonomic groups harboring hitherto unknown TE types. The principal subdivision between TEs rests upon the involvement of RNA into the replication cycle (class I TEs) or lack thereof (class II TEs). In class I autonomous TEs, the process of RNA copying into DNA requires that the TE codes for an RT, the enzyme capable of performing RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. On these grounds, the novel TEs described herein, named Terminons, can be unambiguously classified as retrotransposons. This, however, does not rule out the presence of enzymatic activities that may be involved in additional stages of the transposition cycle, which may even include rolling-circle replication. In total, the newly annotated Terminons occupy 1.1% of the A. vaga genome, increasing the known TE content from $3% (Flot et al. 2013 ) to slightly over 4%. Arkhipova et al. . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE Molecular signatures around Terminons clearly point at terminal addition as the primary integration mechanism ( fig. 3D ). The characteristic 5 0 -truncation (supplementary fig. S2 , Supplementary Material online), which in nonLTR retrotransposons is often ascribed to premature RT fall-offs, in Terminons may also result from terminal DNA erosion, if the 5 0 -end is exposed to exonucleases before being capped by telomeric repeats. Long head-to-tail chains of sequentially added Terminons can exceed 60 kb in length, thereby greatly increasing the buffer zone that counteracts the ongoing terminal erosion. Site-specific integration into telomeric repeats, as observed in Bombyx mori for SART/TRAS retrotransposons (Fujiwara et al. 2005) , is highly unlikely, because Terminons are often found attached to terminally truncated and healed host genes or TEs. The observed bias towards oppositely oriented transcriptional units, especially 3 0 -truncated ones, could indicate a shift from uni-strand piRNA-producing loci known to operate in somatic tissues to dual-strand loci known to operate in the germ line, via antisense transcriptional units often lacking a proper poly(A) signal (Mohn et al. 2014; Weick and Miska 2014; Kowalik et al. 2015) . Members of the most prolific T family (supplementary figs. S2 and S6C, Supplementary Material online) have additionally incorporated a small transcriptionally active antisense ORF near the 3 0 end.",

Fungal EN(\u00c0) PLEs can be very efficient at terminal addition, occupying every telomere in some basidiomycetes, for example, Agaricus bisporus and Tuber melanosporum (Martin et al. 2010; Foulongne-Oriol et al. 2013) . These EN(\u00c0) PLEs code for a single nonframeshifted ca. 1000-aa CC-RT ORF, but have no additional coding capacities. Thus, terminal addition per se does not require an extended ORF repertoire, although telomeric placement is clearly associated with the HHR motifs and reversecomplement telomeric repeats, which in bdelloids are uniquely exposed next to the HHR fold for optimal annealing to G-rich overhangs ( fig. 3A and D) .",

Rather, their phylogeny is more consistent with complex elements evolving from shorter ones via splitting of longer ORFs; acquisition of additional ORFs, possibly at the transcript level to account for coorientation; accumulation of introns; and loss of frameshifts. The L clade may serve as an example of recent expandability, as it still retains HHR remnants between neighboring ORFs (supplementary fig. S6D , Supplementary Material online). A split of ancestral elements into individual subdomains, perhaps by insertion of W-like ORFs, may have been accompanied by combination of elements with different subdomains, eventually giving rise to a highly complex structure preserving only one active RT compatible with a cognate HHR motif, which permits retrotransposition of the entire unit starting with HHR. The pLTR structure appears to have undergone a shift in HHR positioning relative to telomeric repeats (type I to type I.t; fig. 3A and D), which was likely selected to favor the optimal 3 0 -terminal configuration. Interestingly, a recent study associates HHR motifs with nonautonomous LTR retrotransposons, which may exist as short RNA circles (Cervera et al. 2016) ; however, all of those motifs belong to type III but not type I, differing in the topology of the open-ended helix, and possibly reflecting different structural requirements of PLE and LTR RTs.",

            "text": "It may be asked whether the unique structural characteristics of these retroelements could be associated with any biological features specific to the class Bdelloidea. In our view, the most relevant biological feature is the unusual susceptibility of bdelloid telomeric regions to acquisition of foreign genetic material and amplification of foreign genes and host multigene families (Flot et al. 2013; Rodriguez and Arkhipova 2016) . PLEs are unique in their capacity to retain Giant Retrotransposons at Telomeres . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE introns after retrotransposition, which is also applicable to genes captured between pLTRs (Arkhipova et al. 2003 . Retromobility of longer templates would be disfavored at internal chromosomal locations in the absence of a reliable integration mechanism, as it would largely depend on preexisting nicks or breaks. Bdelloid telomeres, however, apparently offer the opportunity to bypass intrachromosomal integration by supplying the exposed G-rich overhangs, and a TE which can take advantage of such overhangs for its proliferation can additionally provide the host with extra means of terminal DNA addition. The terminal attachment mode does not rule out occasional intrachromosomal integration events, which might be triggered by random DNA breakage or by the presumed nicking activity of GIY-YIG EN when present. However, such events would be rare in comparison with terminal addition, since the lack of RT-EN fusion eliminates the cis-preference effect based on cotranslational cis-recognition of structural elements near the 3 0 -end of the template by the RT.",

Combination of putatively structural ORF types with differently charged N-termini within a unit suggests that they participate in formation of RNP particles with unusual properties. The associated cis-acting elements are strongly correlated with foreign genes and multigene families in the bdelloid rotifer A. vaga, suggesting their participation in intragenomic and/or intergenomic gene transfer.",

While it is evident that Terminons have been recently transposing, as judged by thehigh degree of nucleotide sequence identitywithin some families (WJ, T) (supplementary fig. S2 and fig. S6C , Supplementary Material online), the sequenced A. vaga strain has been maintained in the laboratory for over 25 years and is no longer experiencing selective pressures to which natural populations are subjected, allowing ORFs to decay. Thus, we expect that further understanding of Terminon biology will come from comparative analysis of multiple bdelloid natural isolates. Although the mode of transmission for most families is predominantly vertical, as their interspecific divergence parallels that of host genes (data not shown), some families could exhibit horizontal mobility.ThegiantsizeandvariableORFcompositionofretroelements described herein pose new challenges to developers of automated TE annotation tools, and leave us wondering how many unknown TE types with the potential to give rise to novel intracellular or extracellular entities are lurking in the still poorly explored genomes of understudied taxonomic groups, and what unanticipated impacts they can have on their eukaryotic hosts.",

The substitution in the core catalytic HHR motif, however, did not prevent successful expansion of W2 family in A. vaga (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online), implying that RNA structural properties are more important for proliferation than catalytic properties. Indeed, our tests for HHR activity in vitro (fig. 3B) demonstrate that self-cleavage in the JW HHR (three identical tandem units) is seen only in 25 mM MnCl 2 and does not occur under physiological conditions or in MgCl 2 , reinforcing the idea that efficient catalysis in the HHR motif is not required for Terminon transposition. Although HHR motifs in a few other PLEs are also nonfunctional under physiological conditions (Cervera and De la Pena 2014), our experiments show that the HHR in a canonical A. vaga PLE, AvPen3a (Arkhipova et al. 2013), can efficiently selfcleave as a monomer in 3 mM MgCl 2 (fig.3C). Tandem duplication of the HHR-bearing segments is thought to be important for functionality of minimalist HHRs in Cervera and De la Pena 2014), although, contrary to the dimer requirement reported for PLEs",
