            "text": "Members within the order Chiroptera are extremely successful in terms of ecological diversity, accounting for more than one-fifth (\u223c1,000) of all extant mammal species (Simmons 2005). Bats play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as pollinators, insect controllers, seed dispersers, and reforesters (Kunz et al. 2011). They are also instrumental as vectors of zoonotic pathogens, being the reservoir for a number of infectious agents capable of crossing species barriers and of infecting human and nonhuman hosts (Calisher et al. 2006). Recent studies have contributed to enlarge the list of viruses infecting bats (Chu et al. 2008; Falc\u00f3n et al. 2011; Drexler et al. 2012; Kurth et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2012), and so far, more than 80 different viral agents have been identified including the highly pathogenic rabies virus (Turner 1975) and related lyssaviruses (Samaratunga et al. 1998), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Field et al. 2000; Chua et al. 2002), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Monath 1999; Leroy et al. 2005), and SARS virus (Li et al. 2005). Moreover, beyond their role as potential reservoirs of infectious agents, there is growing concern about bat disease and mortality. Approximately 25% of the world\u2019s bat species are threatened with extinction and yet, little is known about actual bat pathogens (Rector et al. 2006; M\u00fchldorfer et al. 2011).",

The approximately 8,000 bp genome includes an upstream regulatory region, and up to eight open reading frames (ORFs) named after their expression timing, with an early region encoding for the proteins involved in viral replication and immunomodulation and a late region encoding for the capsid proteins. Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the skin and mucosa of mammals, but they have also been found in birds, turtles, and snakes and probably infect all amniotes (Bravo et al. 2010). Although most PVs cause asymptomatic infections, some PVs can provoke malignant cell transformations. Certain human PVs are responsible for over one-third of all infection-associated cancers in humans, including different types of anogenital cancers, head and neck cancers, and skin cancers in genetically susceptible individuals (Zur Hausen 2009). Further, neoplastic malignant lesions have also been linked to animal PVs in several different hosts: bats (RaPV1) (Rector et al. 2006), cats (FcaPV2 and FcaPV3) (Lange CE, Tobler K, Markau T, et al. 2009), dogs (CPV1, CPV3, and CPV7) (Lange CE, Tobler K, Ackermann M, et al. 2009), horses (BPV1, BPV2 and EcPV2) (Nasir and Campo 2008; Scase et al. 2010), rodents (McPV2) (Nafz et al. 2008), rabbits (SfPV1) (Giri et al. 1985), and sheep (OvPV3) (Alberti et al. 2010).",

However, more than half of all known PVs correspond to human PVs (PAvE, Papillomavirus Episteme Database, http://pave.niaid.nih.gov/, last accessed December, 2013). Considering that there are over 23,000 amniote species serving as potential hosts (Bravo et al. 2010; International Union for Conservation of Nature 2013, http://www.iucnredlist.org/, last accessed December, 2013), we have little insight of nonhuman PV diversity. The development of a comprehensive and unbiased scenario for PVs evolution demands the consideration of poorly studied groups such as bats. To date, only five different bat PVs have been fully sequenced. MschPV1, MschPV2, and MrPV1 were isolated, respectively, from oropharyngeal and/or anal swabs from healthy free-ranging Miniopterus schreibersii and Myotis ricketti individuals (Tse et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2012), while EhelPV1 was retrieved from hair bulbs from a healthy captive Eidolon helvum individual (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. 2013). RaPV1 was recovered from a basosquamous carcinoma on the wing of a Rousettus aegyptiacus individual (Rector et al. 2006). Partial sequences of the E1 and L1 genes have also been retrieved from hair bulbs from a healthy captive Pteropus giganteus (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. 2013). Further, Baker et al. (2013) conducted a metagenomic study on African Ei. helvum bats, resulting in the identification of hundreds of short PV-like sequences, isolated from throat, lung, and urine samples.",

The E1\u2013E2\u2013L2\u2013L1 gene combination generated well-supported phylogenies (fig. 1) in which PVs segregated into four major groups, as previously described: Alpha + OmikronPVs (infecting Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Cetacea, Chiroptera, and Primates), Beta + XiPVs (infecting Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Eulipotyphla, Primates, and Rodentia), Delta + ZetaPVs (infecting Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla), and Lamba + MuPVs (infecting Carnivora, Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Primates, and Rodentia). Bat PVs did not constitute a monophyletic group. Instead, phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of at least five different bat PV lineages: 1) RaPV1 showed an uncertain position basal to the tree; 2) EserPV2 and MschPV1 appeared as sister taxa, close to the basal branching events of the four crown groups; 3) MrPV1 was the sister taxon of the UmPV1, confidently nested within the Alpha + OmikronPVs crown group; 4) EserPV1, EserPV3, and RferPV1 constituted a monophyletic clade within the Lambda + MuPVs crown group; 5) EhelPV1 and MschPV2 showed an uncertain phylogenetic position within the Lambda + MuPVs crown group (fig. 1 and supplementary fig.

However, a systematic topology analysis reveals the absence of congruence between these PVs and their host phylogenies, without a single example of identical tree topologies for both PVs and hosts (Chan et al. 1997; Antonsson and Hansson 2002; Gottschling, Bravo et al. 2011; Gottschling, G\u00f6ker et al. 2011). The contribution of the different mechanisms to the evolution of PVs can be quantified, and virus\u2013host co-evolution explains only around 30% of all events needed to invoke reconciliation of PVs and hosts phylogenetic trees (Gottschling, G\u00f6ker et al. 2011). This value should nevertheless be taken with caution, given the limited taxon of animal PVs and the focus on human PVs. The lack of global congruence between PVs and host trees is also reflected on the existence of several polyphyletic lineages for PVs infecting the same host. This is true for PVs isolated from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, macaques, rodents, dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, horses, dolphins, and porpoises (fig. 1 and supplementary fig.

Bats monophyly is widely accepted and supported both by morphological (Simmons 1994) and molecular studies (Murphy et al. 2001). The existence of several polyphyletic bat PVs lineages rejects the hypothesis of co-evolution between PVs and bats at a global scale. Likewise, co-evolution as a more recent event seems also unlikely. Under a strictly co-evolution pattern, one would expect pteropid and rhinolophid PVs (RaPV1, EhelPV1, and RferPV1) to be monophyletic, while PVs infecting the remaining bats should form a different clade. One would also expect serotine and myotid PVs to be more closely related and both to be sister taxa to the miniopterid PVs (fig. 4). Instead, PVs infecting pteropids, rhilonophids, and vespertilionids are found intermingled in several, only distantly related, PV lineages (fig. 1). In addition to the four novel genomes here communicated, we have identified fragments of ten possible novel PVs from E. serotinus and four from E. isabellinus (supplementary tables S4 and S11, Supplementary Material online). Furthermore, the phylogenetic positions assigned here to other short PV-like sequences isolated from bats (Baker et al. 2013) suggest that the number of different bat PV lineages might be even larger (supplementary fig. S5, Supplementary Material online). The performed analysis placed the metagenomic sequences in close proximity to the novel bat PVs described, but strikingly, some taxa appeared nested within all PVs crown groups. The appearance at the same position of sequences retrieved from different PV genes supports these different locations. Non-assembled sequences must however be regarded preliminary, and cloned, complete genome sequences would be required to fully confirm the relationships of the putative novel viruses. Yet, it seems likely that bats can be the hosts to a plethora of different PVs belonging to all different crown groups.\n",

The PV-specific FAP and CP primers failed to detect EserPV1, EserPV2, and EserPV3 in the screened samples.

PVs are named after the host in which they were first isolated, following the ICTV code (Bernard et al. 2010). All subsequent analyses considering host\u2013virus specificity commonly follow this naming convention as a hypothesis to assume host specificity or at least host preference. However, the results communicated here show that similar viruses can infect different hosts, which sums up to the several examples of heterologous PV infections between distantly related hosts (Munday et al. 2007; van Dyk et al. 2009; Munday and Knight 2010; Gottschling, Bravo et al. 2011). We initially isolated EserPV1, EserPV2, and EserPV3 from oropharyngeal swabs from two different E. serotinus individuals. Notably, the results of the screening performed in bat samples collected from seven different colonies revealed the presence of DNA from EserPV2 and EserPV3 not only in E. serotinus but also in E. isabellinus individuals. These are two morphologically cryptic but molecularly highly differentiated species (above 16% divergence in the cytochrome b gene) within the serotinus species group with different geographic distributions. E. serotinus is widely distributed throughout Europe, while E. isabellinus shows a patchy distribution restricted to the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. 2006; Juste et al. 2013). The growing number of PV cross-infections descriptions suggests that certain PVs might exhibit a broader host range and/or that host switches between different species might occur more frequently than initially suspected. This potential to infect different hosts could help explain the highly polyphyletic and/or paraphyletic pattern that many PVs display.",

            "text": "During evolution, and independently for different PV clades, the E2\u2013L2 intergenic region has often behaved as a target for recombination: during viral integration in cancers (Doorbar et al. 2012); early in the evolution of AlphaPVs (Bravo and Alonso 2004; Varsani et al. 2006; Angulo and Carvajal-Rodr\u00edguez 2007); between PVs belonging to different genera (Gottschling, Bravo et al. 2011; Gottschling, G\u00f6ker et al. 2011; Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2012); and even between members of two viral families, Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae (Woolford et al. 2007). The E2\u2013L2 region can also accommodate both coding and noncoding genomic segments, which may have gained access to the PV genomes through recombination events with hitherto nonidentified donors. On the one hand, Alpha- and DeltaPVs encode in their E2-L2 region for different nonevolutionarily related E5 proteins (Bravo and Alonso 2004). On the other hand, LambdaPVs, EePV1, isolated from an European hedgehog, and the RferPV1 reported here, all incorporate a large noncoding region (NCR2) in the intergenic E2\u2013L2 region. No regulatory, promoter, or coding elements can be identified in these NCR2, and the presence and conservation of such a long segment of around 1 kb, i.e., 15% of the viral genome, is puzzling. All these putative recombination events in the intergenic E2\u2013L2 region of the PVs have likely occurred as individual, independent events. The alternative hypothesis of all clades containing elements between E2 and L2 to be monophyletic is rejected (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, P value <0.01) when compared with nonconstrained trees. Our interpretation implies thus that at least five independent recombination events (identified in fig. 1) may have occurred in between the E2 and L2 genes throughout the evolutionary history of PVs.",

Our results strongly point toward multiple forces as drivers of PVs evolution, including co-evolution, adaptive radiation, broad host range, host switch, and recombination. However, as long as our knowledge of PVs, diversity is biased toward a specific host (humans) and thus unbalanced, sound conclusions about PVs evolution cannot be reached. The number of nonhuman PVs has increased in recent years (currently 114 known nonhuman PVs isolated from 55 different species). Yet, taxonomic sampling is insufficient and clades such as Afrotheria or Xenarthra remain largely unexplored. A systematic sampling would eventually allow the development of a comprehensive evolutionary framework reconciling the biology, epidemiology, and genomic structure of PVs. Only with this scenario we will be able to provide an answer to many of the still unsolved questions such as the presence of signatures in different PVs that account for their oncogenic potential, their cell tropism, or their host range.",
