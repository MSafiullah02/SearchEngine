This study investigated the response of five strains of C. parvum to UV. A collimated beam apparatus was used to apply controlled doses of monochromatic (254 nm) UV to oocysts of the Iowa, Moredun, Texas A&M, Maine, and Glasgow strains. Irradiation was measured using a calibrated radiometer and sensor. Inactivation was quantified through animal infectivity by inoculation of cohorts of CD-1 neonatal mice with UV-treated and untreated control oocysts of each strain followed by examination of intestinal sections for infection using hemotoxylin and eosin staining. A UV light dose of 10 mJ/cm 2 achieved at least 4-log 10 inactivation of all strains evaluated. All five strains of C. parvum were shown to be highly susceptible to low levels of UV light. ryptosporidium is recognized as an important and widely distributed enteric pathogen of young livestock and is common in a variety of mammals (Casemore et al, 1997) .
