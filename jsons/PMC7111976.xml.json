            "text": "Protein IX is a non-essential protein in the capsid of human adenoviruses (HAdV). The protein has a size of 14.3 kDa, is present at 240 copies per virion, and has three highly conserved regions present in the amino (N) terminus, the central part (alanine-rich), and the carboxy (C) terminus (leucine-rich). The location and function of protein IX in the virus capsid has been the subject of investigation and debate for many years (Vellinga et al., 2005b). Recent work by different groups has brought consensus on its location and topology in the capsid (Fabry et al., 2009, Saban et al., 2006). The N-terminus of the protein is located in between hexon cavities of the groups of nine (GON) hexons, presumably stabilizing the GONs. The C-terminus of the protein forms an alpha helix and is exposed on the capsid surface in close contact with hexon hypervariable region 4 (HVR4) (Saban et al., 2006). C-terminal domains of three protein IX molecules associate in a parallel orientation, whereas a fourth domain binds in an antiparallel orientation (Fabry et al., 2009). The role of protein IX in the capsid remains enigmatic. In vitro analysis revealed the N-terminus of protein IX to confer a thermostable phenotype on HAdV-5 capsids (Vellinga et al., 2005a). Propagation of protein IX gene deleted HAdV-5 in cell culture yields wild-type like virus titers, demonstrating that protein IX is dispensable for virus replication in vitro.",

            "text": "Protein IX has potential as an anchor for the attachment of different types of polypeptides to the viral capsid. Targeting of HAdV-5 to tumor cells has been achieved by genetically fusing protein IX to a single-chain T cell receptor directed against MHC class I in complex with MAGE-A1 peptides (de Vrij et al., 2008). Similarly, integrin-binding arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartate (RGD) peptides, as well as single-chain antibody fragments have been incorporated in this way (Vellinga et al., 2007, Vellinga et al., 2004). Alternatively, targeting ligands can be coupled to protein IX via the genetic inclusion of cysteine residues and subsequent chemical coupling of ligands to the reactive thiol groups (Corjon et al., 2008). Multiple polypeptides can be incorporated simultaneously (Tang et al., 2009). A triple-mosaic HAdV-5 vector was developed with a poly-lysine motif, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase, and the monomeric red fluorescent protein fused with protein IX, thereby combining targeting, therapeutic, and imaging modalities. Recently, it was demonstrated that HAdV-5 vaccine vectors with pathogen-specific antigens fused to pIX can stimulate robust protective immune responses in animals, suggesting a new route for the development of improved HAdV-5 based recombinant vaccines (Bayer et al., 2010, Boyer et al., 2010).",

The exact molecular mechanism behind this \u2018\u0394pIX effect\u2019 remains to be delineated.

Cell lines with varying expression levels of CAR were included (Fig. 1B). Whereas similar expression levels were obtained with both vectors in the CAR-positive cell lines HeLa, A549, and MEL2A, the vector Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX yielded higher levels than Ad5\u0394E1+pIX in the CAR-negative cell lines MZ2-MEL3.0 and VH10. Since these results suggested a specific role of the protein IX lacking vector in mediating relatively higher transduction in the absence of CAR, Ad5\u0394E1+pIX and Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX were analyzed for reporter gene expression in MZ2-MEL3.0 cells versus MZ2-MEL3.0/CAR cells (Fig. 2B). MZ2-MEL3.0/CAR cells stably expressed CAR via transduction with a recombinant lentivirus, which was confirmed by flow cytometry and immune-fluorescence staining (Fig. 2A). In MZ2-MEL3.0 cells the reporter gene expression upon infection with Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX was found to be ten-fold increased compared to infection with Ad5\u0394E1+pIX, while in MZ2-MEL3.0/CAR cells the difference was a mere two-fold (Fig. 2B). The enhanced transgene expression for Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX on the CAR-negative cell line MZ2-MEL3.0 appeared to be not affected by the establishment of protein IX expression in the cells (by using the recombinant lentivirus LV-CMV-pIX-IRES-NPTII; Vellinga et al., 2006) prior to the transduction) (result not shown).",

The Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX stock appeared to contain more small particulate matter, possibly virus debris. As previously described, pIX-deficient HAdV-5 particles have an enhanced tendency to partly dissociate into fiber- and penton base-lacking particles (Fabry et al., 2005).

To answer the question if Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX still uses integrins for cellular uptake, we analyzed Ad5\u0394E1+pIX and Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX for transgene expression (GFP) in the presence or absence of bivalent cations, which are necessary for integrin-mediated uptake of wild-type HAdV-5 into cells (Wickham et al., 1993) (Fig. 4A). This experiment again displayed a stronger reporter gene expression of Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX in MZ2-MEL3.0 cells compared to Ad5\u0394E1+pIX. For both vectors the transduction appeared to be totally dependent on the presence of bivalent cations, with a complete reduction to background GFP levels for the cation-negative incubation. This is consistent with integrin-mediated uptake for both vectors. More specifically, the integrin-dependency of Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX was confirmed by a small but significant (approximately two-fold) decrease in transduction after incubation of MZ2-MEL3.0 cells with antibodies directed against \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 integrins (Fig. 4B). Similar antibody-blocking (1.5-fold reduced transduction for anti-\u03b1V\u03b23 and anti-\u03b1V\u03b25) was observed for Ad5\u0394E1+pIX. Incubating the cells with higher concentrations of antibodies did not result in further reductions in transduction levels (data not shown). Anti-integrin-mediated blocking of transduction was also observed on A549 cells (Fig. 4B). From these data we conclude that the vector Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX still uses integrins for cell internalization in CAR-deficient cells.",

In parallel to cell tropism extending capsid modifications described for other viruses (de Haan et al., 2005), it is likely that protein IX deletion from a replication-competent HAdV-5 virus would result in a modified ability to spread in monolayer cell cultures. To investigate this, we constructed the replication-competent HAdV-5 viruses Ad5+pIX and Ad5\u0394pIX. Both viruses expressed GFP, allowing accurate measurement of plaque size. On A549 cells the plaque size for the Ad5\u0394pIX virus (median 30 arbitrary surface units (ASU), range 20\u2013170) appeared to be significantly smaller than the plaque size for Ad5+E1+pIX (median 100 ASU, range 30\u2013290). A similar difference in plaque size was observed on the CAR-negative cell line VH10, with Ad5\u0394pIX (median 50 ASU, range 30\u2013150) yielding much smaller plaques compared to Ad5+pIX (median 100 ASU, range 75\u2013280). From these analyses we conclude that protein IX-gene deletion from the genome of the replication-competent virus results in a decrease in virus spread in CAR-positive (A549) as well as CAR-negative (VH10) monolayer cell cultures.",

For both these aspects, it will be highly interesting to determine the effect of protein IX-deletion on the interaction of HAdV-5 vectors with white blood cells. Therefore, we incubated freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Ad5\u0394E1+pIX and Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX, and analyzed GFP expression and the expression of cellular activation markers. This revealed relatively high levels of GFP expression in the monocyte population. The percentage of GFP-positive monocytes was similar for both vectors, varying between 10% and 30% at 100 pp/cell, depending on the donor (data not shown). For both vectors the GFP expression in the T cell, B cell, and NK cell populations was very low (< 1% GFP-positive cells). Although Ad5\u0394E1+pIX and Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX showed identical GFP expression levels in the monocytes, the incubation with Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX resulted in a remarkably higher level of monocyte activation, as indicated by enhanced CD86 expression (Fig. 5A). The percentage of CD86 positive monocytes as well as the mean fluorescence intensity for CD86 was significantly higher for the pIX-lacking vector. This enhancement in monocyte activation was observed for monocytes derived from PBMCs of three different donors and with different virus batches. The up-regulated CD86 level involved the entire Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX-incubated monocyte population, not only the GFP-positive cells (Fig. 5A). Incubation with Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX also resulted in enhanced activation of NK cells, as demonstrated by an increase in CD69 expression (Fig. 5B). Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) ELISA of PBMC supernatants revealed higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 production after incubation with Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX at the higher input virus levels (Fig. 5C).",

Although speculative, it is very well possible that the presence of protein IX in the HAdV-5 capsid negatively interferes with non-specific cell transduction, and thereby plays a role in determining the virus tropism. Noteworthy, the extended cell tropism of the Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX vector, as presented by its enhanced transduction of CAR-negative cells, did not come with a loss in ability of CAR-mediated transduction of cells. This is clear from the comparison on MZ2-MEL3.0 and MZ2-MEL3.0/CAR. Introduction of CAR in the CAR-negative cells significantly increased transduction levels with Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX. It is conceivable that in CAR-expressing cells the protein IX-deficient particles can use either the CAR/fiber-dependent mechanism, or the CAR-independent pIX-dependent mechanism. Quantifying the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to the total transduction requires tools for specifically blocking the new pathway. Such inhibitors remain to be identified.",

Unfortunately, our efforts to compare the vectors for a general difference in cell-binding affinity, using Alexa488-TFP (tetrafluorophenyl) labeled vector particles, were not conclusive as a result of strong and reproducible negative effects of the labeling procedure on the pIX-deficient vector particles. The effects were not identical for protein IX-positive and protein IX-negative particles, making the results obtained with these particles in comparative binding assays unreliable. Alternative protocols for fluorescent- or radio-labeling of vector particles might be more suitable for comparing the cell-binding affinity. Labeled vector particles might also be used for analyzing differences in cell surface motility between protein IX-containing and protein IX-lacking vectors. Through largely unknown mechanisms HAdV-5 particles migrate on the cell surface and alterations in viral movement can result in modified transduction (Patterson and Russell, 1983).",

Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated GFP expression almost exclusively in monocytes, with similar expression levels for both vectors. However, increased activation of the entire monocyte population (so not exclusively restricted to the GFP-positive population) was observed for Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX, as demonstrated by an enhancement in CD86 expression. CD86 is an activation marker on antigen-presenting cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells, and is important for co-stimulation of T cells (Reiser and Stadecker, 1996). The increased activation of monocytes despite similar levels of transduction (GFP expression) could be due to a direct effect on the monocytes themselves or indirectly via a more efficient stimulation of T cells or NK cells. Uptake of the protein IX-deleted vector may be increased and/or may follow different intracellular trafficking routes (Drouin et al., 2010, McNees et al., 2004). As a consequence, more efficient viral antigen loading onto human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, or an increase in CD86 expression, could lead to more T cell activation, and e.g. IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Of note, most healthy adult donors have HAdV specific T cells (Heemskerk et al., 2003). Indeed, Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX incubation resulted in enhanced production of IFN-\u03b3. Protein IX-gene deletion appeared to affect NK cell activation as well, resulting in increased expression levels of CD69, which is an activation marker for lymphocytes including NK cells (Cambiaggi et al., 1992). Increased T cell activation could have been accompanied by increased levels of other T cell cytokines like interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 is a known activating cytokine of NK cells (He et al., 2004, Trinchieri et al., 1984). Alternatively, the increased production of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant would also be consistent with increased activation of NK cells by the vector lacking pIX, without the involvement of T cells.",

Administration of Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX yielded more than ten-fold higher luciferase activity in the liver, for reasons that remain to be clarified. Extensive research has been devoted to defining the molecular mechanisms behind the sequestration of intravenously administered HAdV-5 in the human liver, with the aim to eventually improve the therapeutic efficacy of intravenously delivered HAdV-5 vectors (reviewed in Di Paolo and Shayakhmetov, 2009). The uptake of HAdV-5 in the liver has been found to occur in a CAR-independent manner and involves binding of the virus particles in the blood to complement factors and immunoglobulins (mediating uptake in Kupffer cell macrophages) (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008, Xu et al., 2008), and coagulation factors (resulting in hepatocyte transduction) (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008, Waddington et al., 2008). The enhanced transduction of the liver with Ad5\u0394E1\u0394pIX observed in our mouse model seems not to be a result of more efficient binding of the vector to coagulation factor X (FX), as can be concluded from our in vitro FX-binding assay. An alternative explanation might be that the absence of protein IX extends the HAdV-5 tropism, enabling the transduction of cells in the liver that do not present CAR. Of interest, primary human hepatocytes were recently found to have CAR localized at cellular junctions that are inaccessible to the hepatic blood flow (Au et al., 2007). This localization is in contrast to the CAR molecules on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (like HepG2), being highly available for HAdV-5 binding (Au et al., 2007, Bangari et al., 2005).",

The plasmids pSh+pIX, pSh\u0394pIX and pBB were constructed as follows. The wild-type HAdV-5 BsrGI\u2013MfeI fragment containing the E1 genes (nucleotides 193\u20133925) was isolated from pTG3602 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Luski, Transgene, Strasbourg, France), and cloned into the BsrGI\u2013MfeI digested pTrackCMV-GFP/LUC (Vellinga et al., 2006), thereby replacing the GFP/LUC genes with the HAdV-5 E1 region. By using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) (primers 3, 4, 5, 6; Table 1) two restriction sites were introduced in the protein IX gene; a ScaI site at the start codon of protein IX and a SpeI site upstream of the protein IX stop codon, thereby creating pShuttle+E1+pIXScaI/SpeI. Next, the pSh\u0394pIX plasmid was constructed by ScaI/SpeI digestion and re-ligation of the protein IX-gene-deleted fragment. The pSh+pIX plasmid was created by introducing the protein IX sequence (amplified from pAd5pIX (Vellinga et al., 2004) by using primers 7 and 8 (Table 1)) into the ScaI/SpeI linearized pShuttle+E1+pIXScaI/SpeI. The ScaI site was restored to the wild-type HAdV-5 sequence by exchanging the ScaI-overlapping MfeI/HindIII fragment with the corresponding fragment from pTG3602. The SpeI site and the downstream \u2018pIX-remainder sequence\u2019 were left intact, since part of this sequence forms a hairpin-loop structure situated over the polyA site of the E1B transcript, which might be essential for efficient polymerase slippage needed for polyadenylation (Sittler et al., 1995).",
