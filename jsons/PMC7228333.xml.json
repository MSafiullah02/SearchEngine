The results of the study by Huang et al suggested that the median values of ALT and AST in the non\u2010ICU group were 27.0 (19.5\u201040.0) and 34.0 (24.0\u201040.5) U/L, respectively, which were at normal range in ICU group; the median values of ALT and AST in the group were 49.0 (29.0 to 115.0) and 44.0 (30.0 to 70) U/L respectively.\n9\n The study failed to investigate the cause of elevated serum transaminase.

In this study, we focused on non\u2010ICU residents. Although the median values of ALT and AST were in the normal range, nearly one\u2010third patients had elevated ALT or AST.

To avoid the impact of previous liver disease on the results of the study, we excluded patients with a previous history of liver disease during the patient enrolment process. Although the median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 12 days, none of these patients had undergone regular antiviral therapy, so possibility of liver injury in these patients resulting from drug may be excluded. COVID\u201019 with liver injury group had increased white blood cells, neutrophils and CRP. The results indicated that the levels of body's inflammation may have certain effects on the liver function of COVID\u201019. The severity of lung CT lesions can reflect the severity of COVID\u201019 to a certain extent. In this study, we found that COVID\u201019 with liver injury had higher CT score; and CT score was the predictor factor of liver injury in COVID\u201019. Although it is not confirmed whether there is a causal relationship between changes in lung CT and liver injury, the above results suggest that patients with severe imaging lesions need to undergo close monitoring of liver function to identify patients with liver damage for early intervention. Liver injury was associated with prolonged hospital stay in our study, so liver damage may be related to prognosis of patients with COVID\u201019.",

This phenomenon may suggest that ACE2\u2010expressing bile duct epithelial cells dedifferentiate and proliferate and become new liver cells. During this compensatory process, some neonatal hepatocytes still retain the characteristics of expressing ACE2 and are susceptible to 2019\u2010nCoV.\n13\n This may be the cause of liver injury in COVID\u201019. The study found a higher proportion of male in COVID\u201019 with liver damage. Whether it is related to the number of ACE2 receptors in male hepatocytes remains unclear.

The diagnosis of fatty liver disease requires the radiology examination in liver, which cannot be widely carried out when the medical resource is limited during the outbreak of COVID\u201019.
