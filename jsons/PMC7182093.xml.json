Many programs reported that these decreased services included medication for opioid use disorder and testing and treatment services for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and sexually transmitted infections. One-quarter (25%) of responding SSPs reported that one or more of their sites had closed due to COVID-19. Write-in responses suggested that factors related to SSP closures included staff safety, staff shortage, and instructions from administrative sponsors. SSPs also reported changing their service delivery model in response to COVID-19. Over one-half (53%) of SSPs are prepacking all supplies for participants, 20% are providing delivery services or only delivery services, and 6% are providing mail-based services. Write-in responses indicated that programs are increasing the amount of supplies provided to clients, usually 2\u20134 weeks\u2019 worth at a time. Over one-quarter (27%) of SSPs reported that they are screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms.",

In some circumstances, this reflected a change in a program\u2019s syringe distribution model from one-for-one (more restrictive) to needs-based (less restrictive). One large program allows in one participant at a time in its fixed site location, is prepackaging supplies, and is limiting visits to a few minutes. Another program moved its indoor exchange activities to an outdoor space, and some programs are trying to provide food for clients. In certain jurisdictions, SSP clients can initiate buprenorphine treatment and receive prescriptions through a telemedicine hotline. Several programs have reduced staffing, and some staff have been unable to work due to their own elevated risk for complications from COVID-19. Staff are often former drug users, some of whom have serious pre-existing conditions, and many are very concerned about acquiring COVID-19. SSPs have PPE for staff, but programs reported limited supplies (e.g., staff are wearing bandanas) and nearly all are concerned about maintaining adequate supply levels.",

Instead, program managers have been empowered to implement changes autonomously and involve SSP staff in these decisions. Several programs have utilized guidance on best practices in the COVID-19 era from large harm reduction organizations. Multiple organizations stated they hope this experience increases the visibility of the public health importance of SSPs.",

Data were collected less than one month after most jurisdictions in the U.S. began implementing stringent social distancing guidance and stay-at-home orders. During those few weeks, approximately one-quarter of SSPs in this sample reported closing at least one site. The rapid closure of many SSPs highlights the thin margins on which many of these programs operate [5]. These closures could potentially have profound negative impacts on the health of PWID. The risk of fatal opioid overdose may increase due to decreased naloxone distribution. A reduction in sterile injection equipment available to PWID may increase risk for HIV, HCV, and other infectious consequences of injection drug use. Disruptions in the availability of HIV and HCV testing will further increase the likelihood of ongoing transmission in communities. Additionally, SSPs often provide direct or indirect linkage to treatment for substance use disorders, and the inability of PWID to access these services further increases their risk of morbidity and mortality.",

Most programs that remain open have made changes to their service delivery model to minimize contact between participants and staff. Indeed, several SSPs reported distributing more syringes and naloxone than before. These interventions are aligned with current best practices for SSPs and could save lives [6, 7]. These programs indicated the desire to retain these changes after the COVID-19 response ends and use this period to experiment and demonstrate the feasibility of these new models. Finally, SSPs stressed the importance of their connections with populations with environmental and structural risk factors for serious COVID-19 sequelae, and their commitment to continuing to serve these participants. These connections present the opportunity to offer COVID-19 screening and testing, which some programs are already doing. Moreover, if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, SSPs may provide a critical venue for the rapid administration of vaccine to historically marginalized and hard-to-reach populations.",
