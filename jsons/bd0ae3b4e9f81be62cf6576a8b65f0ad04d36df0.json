The work deals with the interplay between knowledge diffusion and the spreading of these preventable infections in the population. The knowledge diffusion model combines information acquisition through education, personal experiences, and the spreading of information through a scalefree social network. A conditional probability model is used to model the interdependence between the risk of infection and the level of health awareness acquired. The model is applied to study the spread of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis in the South African province Limpopo. The simulation results show that the effect of various awareness interventions can be very different and that a concerted effort to spread health awareness through various channels is more likely to control the spread of these preventable infections in a reasonable time.",

These models, unlike techniques that focus on cross sectional statistical analysis [8] , also capture the factors affecting the individual and at same time allow global trends to emerge in the simulation environment. The bridging of the gap between the micro and macro levels is a useful feature in the study of knowledge diffusion and epidemics. Moreover, hypothetical scenarios are more easily evaluated using social simulations than other epidemiological models. In addition, the relative simplicity of the \"agent\" in a social simulation makes it possible to explore complex interactions over substantial time durations that are difficult to capture in purely mathematical models.",

As we could not obtain enough data to properly validate the hazard model and its parameters, the results presented in this section should be considered illustrative of what social simulation models could produce. Also, in these simulations, we did not take into account changes resulting from medical advances, or changes in the education attainment over the simulation period. Under the assumed set of parameters, the simulations evaluate the following scenarios over 100 year period: awareness is solely determined by the agent's education. Scenario 2: Agents use their social network to share knowledge but did not have access to advice from medical professionals nor preachers. Scenario 3: Agents get knowledge through mass media outlets only. Scenario 4: Medical professionals and preachers are the only ones spreading knowledge through the social network. Scenario 5: Agents share knowledge within each household only. 7 In all the above scenarios, we recorded the population growth and the number of agents infected by each of the three epidemics. Each scenario was run several times for cross validation and the average result reported here. As expected, the population in Scenario 6 was healthier than all the others and grew from 500 to 8500 in 100 years. In Scenario 6, HIV/AIDS was eliminated within the first 32 years while tuberculosis and malaria infections went down as well.",

These results are obtained using the information transfer rate for correct information ( ) as 0.3 and that of incorrect information ( ) as 0.3. Table 3 gives the population at the end of 100 years and the percentage of the population infected with HIV/AIDS. It is clear that the population grows as the mortality rate due to HIV decreases and the death rate because of these infections remained low. The fifth scenario gave the best result for a scenario in which only one method is enabled, due to the presence of many adults living in the same household, so if the awareness level of each became the highest of all their awareness levels, because they live together and have much time to convince each other with what they know, a lot of agents will have high awareness, and therefore the information will be disseminated more quickly.",
