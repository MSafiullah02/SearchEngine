We report seven mutations observed in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and three unique mutations that showed changes in the secondary structure of the RdRp protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that these mutations alter the stability of RdRp protein.

As of May 8, 2020, more than 3.9 million confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported worldwide with 0.27 million confirmed deaths. To design antiviral therapeutics/ vaccines it is important to understand the genetic sequence, structure and function of the viral proteins. When a virus tries to adapt to a new host, in a new environment at a distinct geographical location, it makes necessary changes in its genetic make-up to bring slight modifications in the nature of its proteins (1) . Such variations are known to helpviruses to exploit the host's cellular machinery that promotes its survival and proliferation. The \u03b2 lymphocytes of host's adaptive immune system eventually identify the specific epitopes of the pathogenic antigen and start producing protective antibodies, which in turn results in agglutination and clearance of the pathogen (2) (3) (4) . Being an efficient unique pathogen, a virus, often mutate its proteins in a manner that it can still infect the host cells, evading the host's immune system. Even when fruitful strategies are discovered and engaged, the high rate of genetic change displayed by viruses frequently leads to drug resistance or vaccine escape (5) .",

RdRp is therefore, a primary target for antiviral inhibitors such as Remdesivir(9) that is being considered as a potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Since, RNA viruses constantly evolve owing to the rapid rate of mutations in their genome, we decided to analyse RdRp protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from different geographical region to see if RdRp also mutate. Here, in the present study, we identified and characterised three mutations in RdRp protein isolated from India against that of the 'Wuhan wet sea food market'(7) SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our data strongly suggests the prevalence of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be considered to develop new approaches for targeting this virus.",

We downloaded protein sequence of NSP12/ RdRp from the database. All these RdRp sequences were first aligned in CLUSTAL Omega to check for similarities or differences. The Clustal Omega algorithm produces a multiple sequence alignment by producing pairwise alignments. Using this algorithm, we identified seven mutations in isolates from Indian SARS-CoV-2 samples compared to Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 RdRp sequence as shown in figure 1. We considered the original Wuhan sequence as the wild type for this comparison. These mutations on RdRp are A97V, A185V, I201L, P323L, L329I, A466V and V880I respectively. Out of these, one isolate (QJQ28357) have triple mutation, two isolates (QJQ28429, QJQ28417) have double mutation, and rest have single mutations (figure 1).",

The valine side chain is larger than alanine, and substitution of valine at position 97 and 185 impairs packing of the protein as revealed by our secondary structure predications at these two sites (figure 2A and 2B, compare panel i and ii). Our analysis showed that there is addition of two sheet at positions 97 and 98 due to mutation of A97V (figure 2A, compare panel i and ii). Similarly, in A185V mutant, there is a loss of turn at 184 and replacement of helix with sheet structure at 181, 182, 183 and 184 positions (figure 2B, compare panel i and ii). Further, our secondary structure prediction also showed changes in secondary structure when proline is substituted by leucine at 323 position (Figure 2D",

There is a loss of turn structures from position 323 and 324 and addition of five sheets at positions 321, 322, 323, 324 and 327 (Figure 2D and H, highlighted in green box). Proline possesses a unique property, its side chain cyclizes back on to the backbone amide position, due to which it contributes to the secondary structure formation because of its bulky pyrrolidine ring that places steric constraints on the conformation of the preceding residue in the helix. The substitution of proline to leucine in the mutant RdRp might result in loss of the structural integrity provided by proline. Leucine is a hydrophobic amino acid and generally buried in the folded protein structure. Altogether, the substitution of alanine to valine at position 97, 185 and proline to leucine at position 323 in mutant RdRp is changing the secondary structure of the protein that might have functional consequences.P323L alters the stability dynamics of tertiary structure of RdRp.",

Our data revealed that there is change in vibrational entropy energy (\u0394\u0394S Vib ENCoM) between the wild type (Wuhan isolate) and the mutant Indian isolate (Figure 3A).Vibration entropy represents the major configurational-entropy contribution of proteins. By definition, it is an average of the configurational entropies of the protein within single minima of the energy landscape, weighted by their occupation probabilities(11). The negative \u0394 \u0394 S Vib ENCoM of mutant RdRp represents the rigidification of the protein structure and positive \u0394 \u0394 S Vib ENCoM represents gain in flexibility.
