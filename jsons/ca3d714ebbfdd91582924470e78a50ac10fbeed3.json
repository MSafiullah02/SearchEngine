Virus mutant isolates falling in four major mutation-strings branches were revealed in all the countries that were examined, suggesting limited, if any, selective advantage of any one of the mutation strings versus the others. Early disease severity in Italy contrasted with a scanty SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum, further diminishing the strength of the proposed model.We then went on to challenge a climate-dependent coronavirus infection model on 168,089 laboratory-confirmed infection cases, as detected from February 21 st to April 14 th 2020 in continental Europe. Data on 86,498 infection cases were collected from March 3 rd to March 27 th infection cases, over 105 provinces in Italy. In performing our analysis, we took advantage of the Italian National Health System (WHO, www.who.int/whr/en/; Bloomberg Global Health Index, 2018, www.bloomberg.com/), which operated as the sole central source of data. Province findings were then consolidated into 22 Regions. The region/province-level analysis tamed the confounding factor of non-homogeneous population density/infection clustering at urban versus countryside areas. As a consequence, infection case curves were expected to distinctly depend on (a) virus infective capacity (R 0 ) 1, 19 and (b) infection clinical severity, patient viral load, disease stage 15, 16. Either one or both of these factors were expected to be modulated by environmental conditions, had this been the case. The average COVID-19 doubling time in the North of Italy was 6.63 days, versus 5.87 days in central regions, and 5.38 days in the South. Spain extended such a trend, with a 4.2-day doubling time. Scandinavia showed longer doubling times of 9.4 days in Sweden, 10.8 days in Finland, and 12.95 days in Norway. Taken together, our findings indicate that COVID-19 spreading associates to a sharp North-South gradient. The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has drawn comparison to the 1918 influenza pandemic, leading people to wonder what the Summer 2020 might bring. It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2, just like flu viruses, is not easily transmitted in hot and dry conditions (www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-could-warming-mean-for-pathogens-like-coronavirus/). However, coronaviruses show resilience to environmental conditions 9 , and SARS-CoV-2 was shown to remain viable over solid surfaces for up to 72 hours 10 . Our findings suggest that high environmental temperatures may not efficiently tame SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness.

Among them, a major confounding factor in COVID-19 is the time of initial infection at any given place, which, everything else being equal, leads to vastly different absolute numbers of derived cases 2 .

The largest mutation load that was observed in Spain (n=14), the second hardest-hit country in Europe, appeared very close to that of Sweden (n=13), a country that was largely spared by the COVID-19 course in Europe. Large mutation loads in late-disease-insurgence countries, such as France and Belgium (n=16) suggested closer relationship with length of disease course.
