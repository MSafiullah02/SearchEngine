            "text": "In December 2019, a new coronavirus has emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and have now spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency [1,2]. This coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly 2019-nCoV), is responsible for respiratory infections including pneumonia with a mortality rate estimated about 2%-2.5%, increasing with age and the existence of underlying diseases. On the first days of March 2020, an estimated 89,068 cases had been confirmed worldwide by WHO (a number likely underestimated due to the existence of asymptomatic carriers) and the epidemic has already left 3,046 dead from COVID-19 disease, the majority of them occurring in China. Because COVID-19 is now becoming pandemic and in the absence of known validated efficient therapy, efforts of laboratories and medical teams have focused on repurposing FDA-approved drugs to treat the most severe cases of infection. Drug repurposing is an effective way to quickly identify therapeutic drug with a known safety profile to treat an emerging disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, a front-line drug used in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria also used in autoimmune disease had been shown to inhibit the replication of several DNA and RNA viruses, including most of human coronaviruses [3]. Recently, chloroquine was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its hydroxylated form has been proposed as a possible therapy to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [4,5]. In this contest, other drug showed significant efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 in vitro such as remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir (https://drugvirus.info/) [6].",

            "text": "Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic routinely used to treat bacterial infection was found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV, has joined the list of molecules that could be used as therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19 [7]. This antibiotic, currently used in the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection, especially in Staphylococcal infections, has already showed efficacy against various viruses such as Ebola, influenza virus, flavivirus, hepatitis C virus, HIV virus and on coronavirus such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [8,9]. A patent was filed for the treatment of infection caused by MERS-CoV in 2016 [10]. According to Zhou and colleagues, in coronaviruses, teicoplanin acts on the early step of the viral life cycle by inhibiting the low pH cleavage of the viral spike protein by cathepsin L in the late endosomes thereby preventing the release of genomic viral RNA and the continuation of virus replication cycle. A recent study by the same authors showed that this activity was conserved on SARS-Cov-2 (the target sequence that serve as cleavage site for cathepsin L is conserved among SARS-CoV spike protein) [7]. The concentration of teicoplanin required to inhibit 50% of viruses (IC50) in vitro was 1.66 \u00b5M, which is much lower than the concentration reached in human blood (8.78 \u00b5M for a daily dose of 400 mg) [7]. These preliminary results need to be confirmed now by a randomized clinical trial.",
