A number of contact investigations has shown that transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may occur, although rarely, during long (more than 8 h) flights from an infectious source (a traveller with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis) to other passengers sitting in proximity. However, as yet, no cases of active tuberculosis disease following exposure on board aircraft have been reported.",

The appropriate technology to ensure quality of air in the cabin of the aircraft, the role of the airline in managing a person suspected of tuberculosis, and the essential collaboration between airline and public health authorities are emphasized. However, the limitations of air companies in preventing an infectious person from travelling are also clearly expressed, showing that, regardless of the willingness to cooperate with public health authorities, it will not be easy to prevent potential exposures on board.",

The authors describe the difficulty in obtaining complete information on passengers for contact investigation. They note that 82% of the 104 reported active tuberculosis cases were highly infectious, sputum smear-positive patients. Expectedly, a vast majority (87%) of reported active tuberculosis cases were people born outside Canada.",

They found that only 22% (758) of presumed contacts of 131 index cases had tuberculosis test results reported. Among them, 182 (24%) passenger-contacts had positive test results, but positivity was strongly associated with other risk factors for tuberculosis infection (OR 23; p\n < 0.001). No case of active tuberculosis was ever reported among contacts. Therefore, the risk of M. tuberculosis transmission during air travel remains difficult to quantify, although it is presumably low. A detailed analysis by Kornylo-Duong et al. on three investigations among contacts of air travellers with infectious tuberculosis shows that 15 out of 16 air travellers who tested positive for latent tuberculosis infection were from countries with high tuberculosis incidence. Therefore, establishing a relationship between on board exposure and transmission of infection is unwarranted.",

It also describes the way to deal with incidents when they occur, the basic provisions of IHR, and the measures that could apply to incidents related to the potential of tuberculosis transmission among air travellers.
