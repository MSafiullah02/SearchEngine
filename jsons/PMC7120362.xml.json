A 64-slice scanner allowed for a scan time below 10 s. The most modern scanners (128-slice scanners and beyond) allow for coverage of the chest in less than 3 s while acquiring data with isotropic submillimeter resolution. Thus, speed of data acquisition within one breath-hold does not represent a limitation anymore.",

With optimal scan technique, the spatial resolution is as low as 0.5 mm. Due to the high contrast within the lung parenchyma, even structures as small as 0.2 mm can be visualized (Murata et al. 1989). Thus, pulmonary artery branches down to the 16th and bronchi down to the 8th generation can be depicted. Since partial volume averaging effects on the margins of such small structures are minimized, HRCT provides a very accurate image of their true size. This represents the base for CT-based quantification, e.g., of bronchial wall thickness and airway lumen in COPD patients. Since this high resolution is available isotropically, meaning in all three directions, diameters of vessels, lung nodules, or obliquely oriented bronchi are accurately reflected, irrespective of their location in or near the scan plane or even perpendicular to the scan plane (Fig. 2).\n",

Sharp, high-spatial-frequency, or high-resolution algorithms, on the other hand, reduce image smoothening and increase spatial resolution.

The abovementioned survey in 2013 confirmed that 90 % of the respondents indeed apply it. Additional options are to adapt the protocol to patient weight, patient age, or scan indication. Principally a tube voltage of 120 kV is recommended, but in young patients or patients of lower body weight, a tube voltage of 100 kV can be applied, further contributing to dose saving. The tube current is mostly set around 100 mAs. Ultimately a dose between 1.5 and 4 mSv should be aimed for (Fig. 3).\n\n",

Christe A et al. systematically evaluated the efficiency of a low-dose protocol for the detection of common patterns of pulmonary diseases evaluating 1 mm slices, reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and a high reconstruction kernel. They concluded that a 120 kVp/40 mAs protocol was feasible for detecting solid nodules, air space consolidations, and airway and pleural diseases; however, pathologies consisting of ground-glass opacities and interstitial opacities required higher tube current or iterative noise reconstruction (Christe et al. 2013).",

While increased spatial resolution is directly correlated with increase of image noise in standard filtered back projection, iterative reconstruction allows for decoupling of spatial resolution and image noise to a certain extent. Once an image has been reconstructed from measured projections, this image itself is used as \u201cscan object\u201d in a simulated CT measurement of the same projection, resulting in an image of calculated projections. The differences between the measured and calculated projections result in correction projections which are subsequently used to update the originally measured projections. This process is repeated until the difference between the calculated projections and measured projections is smaller than a predefined limit. With each update to the original image, image-processing algorithms enhance spatial resolution in higher contrast areas of the image and reduce noise in low contrast areas. While the first generations of IR produced images of lower noise, they were criticized for modifying the visual appearance of images, either being smoothed or pixelated especially with increased weighting of iterative noise reconstruction (Pontana et al. 2011; Prakash et al. 2010) (Fig. 4). The second generation of so-called model-based IR \u2013 active in the raw data space \u2013 aims for reducing noise and maintaining image sharpness, thus having less impact on the visual image impression.\n",

Similarly an excellent inter-method agreement comparing IR and FBP images for the detection of emphysema, GGO, bronchiectasis, honeycombing, and nodules has been described (Ohno et al. 2012). No study evaluating the impact on the diagnostic evaluation of diffuse interstitial lung disease has been published yet, but nevertheless it can be anticipated that modern IR allows for substantial (around 50 %) dose reduction of volumetric HRCT for DILD, which represents an important step forward in terms of radiation protection, especially for young patients and patients with multiple follow-up studies.",

There are various ways how to plan these scans: either in areas of pathology seen in inspiration or on specific predefined levels following anatomic landmarks (e.g., carina, aortic arch) in order to facilitate reproducibility in follow-up scans. How many levels need to be covered is unclear and ranges from 2 to 5. Alternatively also the expiratory scan can be obtained with volumetric data acquisition. It has the advantage of decreasing the risk of motion artifacts frequently seen in discontinuous expiratory scans, allows for quantification on a 3D basis, and allows for more precise, level-matched follow-up. Since the only purpose of these scans is the detection, localization, and quantification of air trapping, these scans can be obtained with a drastically reduced dose. Multiple studies have shown that tube current levels as low as 40 mAs are sufficient for the diagnostic purpose intended. Bankier et al. carried out a systematic comparison of expiratory CT scans obtained with 120 kV, 80 mAs, and simulated 60, 40, and 20 mAs scans and found that \u2013 though diagnostic confidence went down with decreasing acquisition dose and interreader variability went up \u2013 diagnostic accuracy was not affected (Bankier et al. 2007).

Dynamic scans were firstly introduced using an electron beam CT; however, it can also be performed with any MDCT scanner with a gantry rotation time of 1 s or less. Because images can be reconstructed at any time point during the scan, the temporal resolution is even higher than with the electron beam CT. Mostly continuous imaging is performed on a single axial level for 6\u20138 s as the patient expires rapidly. Acquisition dose is drastically reduced (usually 40 mAs). Lucidarme et al. (2000) found a significantly higher density difference between the different areas of attenuation and a higher extent of air trapping in dynamic scans as opposed to static scans, but the number of patients for which dynamic scan acquisition changed the diagnosis has been found to be small (Gotway et al. 2000).",

Such a biomarker should be measurable but also reproducible and linked to relevant clinical outcome parameters (Goldin 2013). To meet the first two demands, rigorous standardization of imaging protocols over several sites and time points is needed, including centralized scanner and image quality checks. The underlying technique of automatic, texture analysis-based CT quantification is beyond the scope of this book chapter. There has been a number of studies evaluating the use of a computer-derived quantitative lung fibrosis score (QLF) for assessment of baseline disease extent and changes over time in patients with IPF (Kim 2015) and scleroderma patients treated with cyclophosphamide (Kim 2011). While this algorithm focuses solely on fibrotic changes, a different approach is used by the so-called CALIPER software (computer-aided lung informatics for pathology evaluation and rating), which associates a certain group of neighboring voxels to one of the basic patterns (normal, emphysema, ground glass, honeycombing, and reticular) for the complete lung volume (Bartholmai 2013). A recently published position paper by the Fleischner society (Hansell et al. 2015) acknowledges that CT has not only the potential to select the most appropriate patients to be included in treatment trials but also to represent a study end point in conjunction with other markers. This recent development has been fueled by the increasing precision with which image-processing software can quantify diffuse lung diseases.",

Other forms of interstitial pneumonia, including other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and ILD associated with environmental exposure, medication, or systemic disease, must be excluded. UIP is characterized by the presence of reticular opacities associated with traction bronchiectasis. Honeycombing is critical for making a definite diagnosis following the criteria by Raghu et al.

The distribution of UIP is characteristically predominantly basal and subpleural. Coexistent pleural abnormalities (e.g., pleural plaques, calcifications, pleural effusion) suggest an alternative etiology for the UIP pattern. Also, findings such as micronodules, air trapping, cysts, extensive ground-glass opacities, consolidation, or a peribronchovascular-predominant distribution represent findings inconsistent with UIP and suggest an alternative diagnosis (Fig. 15).\n\n",

The cysts are often confluent, have bizarre or irregular shapes, and are usually thin walled, but may be thick walled. LCH is predominantly located in the upper lobes, with sparing of the costophrenic sinus, which is better depicted on coronal reformations than on cross-sectional images. The thin walls of the cysts are prone to rupture, with an increased risk of pneumothorax. Concomitant nodules are usually irregular, measure 1\u20135 mm, and often have a centrilobular distribution.

Within one individual, however, they are mostly uniform. They have clearly definable walls which are 1\u20133 mm thick. Honeycomb cysts seem to develop from alveolar disruption and massively dilated alveolar ducts and bronchioles. Honeycombing is associated with other findings of lung fibrosis, such as septal and reticular pattern, architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis. Most patients demonstrate several layers of irregular cystic spaces (honeycombs), which are separated from each other by irregular thick walls and intralobular septa and lines. However, note that also a singular layer of cystic spaces with thickened wall are described as honeycombing and fulfill the criteria for a definite UIP under appropriate conditions.",

Secondly, it is important to differentiate honeycombing from tubular bronchiectasis reaching all the way to the pleura.

A number of processing options such as MIP and MinIP ease analysis of HRCT patterns. Most recent developments of detector and reconstruction technology have made up for the disadvantage of continuous versus discontinuous data acquisition of the past, allowing for substantial dose savings. All these arguments have led to the fact that HRCT is routinely based on volumetric data acquisition. Today basically each chest CT offers the spatial resolution of a HRCT in all three dimensions, and it depends on the indication of the examination (e.g., malignancy versus diffuse parenchymal disease) whether contrast media is injected and which slice thickness and reconstruction techniques (e.g., MIP and MinIP) are applied.",
