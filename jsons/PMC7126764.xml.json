            "text": "Pestiviruses are members of the family Flaviviridae and include four recognised species, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) 1 and 2, border disease virus (BDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (Thiel et al., 2005), plus the recently identified pestivirus of giraffe (Avalos-Ramirez et al., 2001, Becher et al., 2003), Bungowannah virus of swine (Kirkland et al., 2007) and \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus (Schirrmeier et al., 2004). The first strain of the last virus, D32/00_\u2018Hobi\u2019, was isolated from a contaminated batch of foetal calf serum (FCS) originating from Brazil and subsequently proposed as prototype of a new species BVDV-3 (Liu et al., 2009a, Liu et al., 2009b). To date, the majority of the \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus detection was related to importation of contaminated FCS from South America (Stalder et al., 2005, Peletto et al., 2010, St\u00e5hl et al., 2010), whereas only few strains were isolated from animals with natural infections (Stalder et al., 2005, Cortez et al., 2006, St\u00e5hl et al., 2007, Decaro et al., 2011). Only in one case the virus was associated to overt disease, which was characterised by occurrence of respiratory distress and death in calves (Decaro et al., 2011). This posed some concerns about the efficacy of BVDV control programs, considering that by commonly used diagnostic protocols \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestiviruses are not detected (Schirrmeier et al., 2004, Peletto et al., 2010, St\u00e5hl et al., 2010). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, a nested PCR assay was developed which was able to detect and characterise correctly BVDV-1, BVDV-2 and \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains (Decaro et al., unpublished).",

Viral RNA was extracted from nasal and rectal swabs using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy), whereas RNA extraction from the WBC pellets was obtained using the QIAamp\u00ae RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A.). \u2018Hobi\u2019-like RNA copy numbers were calculated on the basis of the standard curves generated by 10-fold dilutions of a synthetic RNA obtained by in vitro transcription of a plasmid containing the 5\u2032 UTR of the isolated strain. Reverse transcription was carried out using GeneAmp\u00ae RNA PCR (Applied Biosystems, Applera Italia, Monza, Italy), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The quantitative assay targeting the 5\u2032 UTR was conducted in a 50 \u03bcl-reaction mixture containing 25 \u03bcl of IQ\u2122 Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl), 600 nM of primers T134-F (5\u2032-GACTAGTGGTGGCAGTGAGC-3\u2032) and T220-R (5\u2032-GAGGCATTCCTTGATGCGTC-3\u2032), 200 nM of probe T155r-P (6FAM-5\u2032-ACTCGGGGCTTCGGTGATCCAGGG-3\u2032-BHQ1) and 20 \u03bcl of c-DNA. The thermal profile consisted of activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and annealing-extension at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. To confirm the successful infection of the experimental animals and rule out concurrent infections with other pestiviruses, a nested PCR (nPCR) assay recently developed for detection and characterisation of pestiviruses was employed (Decaro et al., unpublished). This assay is able to type correctly all pestiviruses infecting cattle by using virus-specific nPCR primers, whereas BDV and CSFV are detected only by the first-round amplification but do not react with nPCR oligonucleotides. RT-PCR (first-round amplification) was carried out using SuperScript\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and the following thermal protocol: reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, inactivation of Superscript II RT at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, 68 \u00b0C for 1 min, with a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and visualisation under UV light after bromide ethidium staining. Nested PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold (Applera Italia, Monza, Italy). The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl containing PCR buffer 1\u00d7 (KCl 50 mM, Tris\u2013HCl 10 mM, pH 8.3), MgCl2 2 mM, 200 \u03bcM of each deoxynucleotide (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), 1 \u03bcmol l\u22121of the RT-PCR reverse primer and of each internal species-specific primer, 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold and 5 \u03bcl of a 1:100 dilution in distilled water of the primary PCR product. The thermal conditions consisted of activation of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase at 94 \u00b0C for 10 min and 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 30 s and polymerization at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were detected as for the first-round amplification.",

The SVANOVIR\u2122 ELISA kit was employed following the manufacturer's instructions and using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-bovine IgG monoclonal antibodies provided with the kit. This assay had been proven to react with antibodies against \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus in cattle, albeit the optical density (OD) values obtained were only slightly higher than the cut-off value (OD = 0.200) (Decaro et al., 2011). As for lambs and piglets, considering that the kit does not provide specific antisera, commercial HRP conjugated anti-ovine and anti-swine IgG sera (Sigma\u2013Aldrich srl, Milan, Italy) were used at the dilutions currently employed in our laboratory in other ELISA tests for those species (N. Decaro, personal observation). The VN assay was carried out as described by St\u00e5hl et al. (2007), with minor modifications. Briefly, 100 TCID50 of isolate Italy-1/10-1 were mixed with serial two-fold dilutions of the tested sera and after an incubation for 45 min at +37 \u00b0C, the mixtures were inoculated on MDBK cells developed in 96-well plates. After four days of incubation at +37 \u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2, an IF assay for pestiviruses was carried out on inoculated MDBK cells. Results were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution able to inhibit the appearance of specific fluorescence in inoculated cells.",

Intra-nasal administration of low-virulence BVDV to immunocompetent nonpregnant ruminants resulted in mild disease, which was characterised by moderate leukopenia and fever, respiratory distress and/or enteric signs (Potgieter et al., 1984, Wilhelmsen et al., 1990, Sandvik et al., 1997, Archambault et al., 2000, Baule et al., 2001, Liebler-Tenorio et al., 2003, G\u00e5nheim et al., 2005).

According to this study, which was conducted on two animals per species, the novel pestivirus was able to infect both cattle and pigs. However, infected calves displayed no overt clinical signs, but only slight leukopenia, mild increase in body temperature, viremia and viral shedding, and successful infection of pigs was proved only by seroconversion in the absence of clinical disease and virus shedding.",

            "text": "The results of the present study confirmed only partially those of the pilot experiment. In fact, experimental infection of seronegative calves reproduced the disease observed in the natural outbreak albeit with less severe signs and clinical course. The Koch's postulates were full-filled as the infected animals displayed fever, nasal discharge, moderate leukopenia and a certain degree of viremia, shed the virus with nasal secretions and faeces and seroconverted against the challenge virus. A similar course of infection was observed in lambs, with nasal discharge occurring for a longer period but with less virus being detected in the blood and shed through nasal secretion and faeces. In these animals leukopenia was less profound and long-lasting than in calves. In contrast, inoculated pigs did not show any clinical signs, alteration of WBC counts, viremia and viral shedding. In these animals, detection of low titres of \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus antibodies could be associated to a reaction to the antigen in the inoculum rather than to true seroconversion against the challenge virus. However, the fact that the virus was administered intranasally should rule out antibody production in the absence of active infection. Specific antibodies were detected in all inoculated animal species by means of VN using the homologous virus, reaching discrete titres in calves and lambs. When a commercial kit commonly used for detection of BVDV antibodies was employed, OD values in calves were greatly lower than those expected, a finding that had been already observed in a previous study (Decaro et al., 2011). Although the test has not been fully validated in the ovine and swine species, BVDV ELISA tested negative in lambs and piglets despite the presence of \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus VN antibodies. These findings pose some concerns about a possible poor sensitivity of commercial BVDV ELISA tests as for the detection of antibodies against \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains, which may affect pestivirus surveillance programs mainly in cattle herds. Therefore, an ELISA test specific for \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus antibodies is needed in order to considerably improve the surveillance activity on this new pestiviral species in cattle.",

Atypical pestivirus strains responsible for natural infections were recovered in South America and Thailand from a bubaline blood (Stalder et al., 2005) and a bovine serum (St\u00e5hl et al., 2007), respectively, but there was no evidence for associated clinical signs. \u2018Hobi\u2019-like sequences were detected in aborted bovine foetuses in Brazil, thus suggesting direct clinical implications (Cortez et al., 2006). More recently, this virus was associated to severe respiratory disease in a cattle herd in Italy (Decaro et al., 2011). Based on the experimental data obtained from the present study and on previous reports of natural outbreaks (Decaro et al., 2011), \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestiviruses are likely to infect primarily cattle, although other animal species, including buffaloes and wild ruminants, cannot be ruled out as natural hosts and reservoirs of the virus.",
