            "text": "The World Health Organization has declared antibiotic resistance a global public health threat, based on rising rates of resistant pathogens and diminishing rates of new antibiotic development [1]. Antimicrobial stewardship is a cornerstone of efforts to counter this threat. However, evidence-informed stewardship treatment decisions for patients with life-threatening illnesses such as bloodstream infections are challenging because little evidence exists for the optimal duration of treatment. Among patients with suspected bloodstream infections, broad-spectrum antibiotics must be initiated empirically because early adequate empiric treatment is associated with improved survival [2, 3]. Due to the rising prevalence of resistant organisms, the tailoring or de-escalation of these empiric regimens is not possible even when blood culture and susceptibility results become available. Patients must then remain on broad-spectrum agents for their full treatment course [4]. Therefore, shortening total treatment durations may be the most feasible approach to minimize patient-level and societal-level antimicrobial harms [5].",

In this BALANCE-Ward pilot trial, as per the prior BALANCE-ICU pilot trial focused on critically ill patients, randomization was determined through a central, web-based system (http://www.randomize.net) with variable block sizes of four to six patients, stratified by site. The intervention related only to the duration of treatment, with patients randomized 1:1 in parallel to 7 versus 14 days of treatment. All other aspects of care (antibiotic selection, doses, intervals, routes of delivery, and timing of hospital discharge) were at the discretion of the clinical team. Participant and clinician blinding and placebo controls were not used given the diversity of pathogens and underlying foci of infection, but allocation concealment was maintained until the seventh day of treatment to mitigate selection bias and differential treatment. The central study team and statistician were blinded to treatment group. The BALANCE-Ward pilot trial was registered separately on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02917551), with unique ethics approval at all participating sites, so that enrolled patients could be kept distinct from the main trial until completion of the pilot and evaluation of feasibility.",

Protocol adherence was defined as receipt of 7 \u00b1 2 days of antibiotics or 14 \u00b1 2 days of antibiotics for patients randomized to shorter versus longer duration treatment, respectively. We did not target a specific protocol adherence rate to consider the trial feasible, but sought to determine whether the protocol adherence rate would exceed the rate seen in the BALANCE ICU pilot RCT (77%) [9]. As with the BALANCE ICU pilot RCT, we expected that there would be some patients for whom clinicians would continue antibiotic treatment beyond the assigned duration because of concerns of new infection, persistent infection, or previously unrecognized deep-seated infection. These were counted as protocol deviations. The target recruitment rate was an average of one patient per site per month to consider including ward enrolments in the BALANCE main trial. The panel of secondary clinical outcomes (e.g., length of stay, mortality, antibiotic-free days, Clostridiodes difficile, and antibiotic resistant organisms) were identical to those collected in the original BALANCE pilot RCT [9, 10]. Included among these secondary outcomes was the planned primary outcome from the main BALANCE RCT, 90-day mortality. Antibiotic-free days were calculated as the number of days alive and not on any antibiotics in the time period from collection of the index blood culture to 28 days after this date; patients that died prior to day 28 were assigned 0 antibiotic-free days. Treatment adherence and clinical outcomes were recorded by the site research coordinator, via chart review and discussion with the clinical team if needed.",

Similarly, we achieved protocol adherence rates of 93%, which exceeded the 77% adherence rates in the ICU population. On the basis of these co-primary outcomes it appears feasible that the BALANCE RCT could be extended from ICUs to include non-ICU patients. The increased recruitment rate on the wards can be attributed to the larger number of bacteremic patients than those who are in the ICU. The superior protocol adherence rates on the general wards may be due to the lower severity of illness and lower risk of secondary nosocomial infections among these patients with shorter lengths of hospital stay and fewer indwelling devices such as endotracheal tubes and central venous catheters.",

On the one hand, merging non-ICU patients with ICU patients into a single trial could be viewed as mixing two heterogeneous populations together. On the other hand, combining these patients together could be considered as reflecting a broader population of patients with bloodstream infection, yielding more generalizable trial results. The ICU and non-ICU pilot trial patients were both infected with a diverse range of Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial pathogens, and each included patients with a diverse range of host comorbidities. Typically a trial based on a specific diagnosis (e.g., pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction) would be conducted across the full spectrum of severity, including those patients admitted to ICU and non-ICU wards. Conceptually, enrolling both non-ICU and ICU patients captures the full spectrum of bacteremic illness, and the patients are only dichotomized by the location of care within the hospital.",

As expected, the 90-day mortality rate was lower than that seen in our prior BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (15%) [9]. The mortality difference between non-ICU and ICU patients is even wider than the ICU pilot data suggest, because a more updated mortality estimate from the BALANCE main trial suggests that the mortality has risen to 17.3%. At a fixed non-inferiority margin of 4%, adding non-ICU ward patients in the study would decrease our total sample size requirement (Fig. 3); maintaining our sample size target would enable us to reduce the achievable absolute non-inferiority margin (Fig. 4). It is important to note that our 4% non-inferiority margin is already much smaller than the non-inferiority margins used in recent trials of antibiotic treatment duration in patients with serious bacterial infections [12\u201315], and is also much lower than the US Federal Drug Administration recommendation of non-inferiority margins for ventilator-associated pneumonia [16].

However, the generalizability is bolstered by inclusion of a mix of both community and academic hospitals, as well as sites with long-standing versus recent involvement in the CCCTG. Another limitation is that we cannot predict whether expansion to include non-ICU enrolment will lead to a compensatory decrease in ICU recruitments by diluting study teams\u2019 efforts across broader clinical units. In our six pilot RCT sites, though, we did not see reductions in ICU recruitments. As BALANCE is expanded hospital-wide, we will assess the interplay of ICU and non-ICU recruitment rates over time. The low rate of enrolment of eligible ward patients, and wide variation across sites, suggests that further efforts may be necessary to foster enrolments, including educating ward clinicians about the pre-RCT work which has documented practice heterogeneity and collective clinical equipoise. The BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT experience suggests that sites with infectious diseases engagement on the study team achieve much higher recruitment rates and percent enrolment of eligible patients, and so this will be crucial for future sites considering hospital-wide recruitment. We will also need to track eligible non-enrolled patients, along with recruitment rates and protocol adherence, as a site-specific metric throughout the conduct of the trial.",

We have carefully reviewed the one-group findings (maintaining allocation concealment) with the CCCTG and the BALANCE international steering committee, both of which have strongly endorsed the option for participating BALANCE sites to extend enrolments hospital-wide. Given the success of this non-ICU pilot, no other protocol changes are required to facilitate inclusion of non-ICU patients in the BALANCE main trial. A detailed statistical analysis plan involving the entire cohort will be published before the trial is completed; randomization will be stratified by ICU and non-ICU ward location, and a subgroup analysis will be conducted. The subgroup analyses, by definition, will not be powered to achieve the same non-inferiority margin as the overall BALANCE trial population. However, the achievable non-inferiority margins within the ICU and non-ICU subgroups will still be less than the non-inferiority margins used in recent landmark antimicrobial minimization studies involving patients with serious bacterial infections [4, 13\u201315]. We anticipate that the final BALANCE trial results will be more generalizable to the full population of patients admitted to hospital with bloodstream infections, and yet will include a majority of critically ill patients, ensuring that the data are relevant to our sickest of patients. In doing so, we hope that BALANCE will provide an evidence foundation for the treatment of a broad range of patients with non-S. aureus bacteremia, and allow us to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms of antimicrobial treatments for bloodstream infections.",
