Gram staining was performed to evaluate sample quality (magnification 10\u00d7) and for direct identification of bacteria and fungi. All samples were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C and retrospectively analysed in the spring of 2012 with the commercial multiplex real-time PCR FTD Respiratory 21 Plus\u00ae.",

Garbino et al. assessed the prevalence of respiratory viruses in different groups of hospitalised adults, with a positivity rate ranging from 12.3% in immunocompetent patients vs. 31.6% in the transplant population (lung transplants excluded) [8], [9]. In our study, patients with haematological malignancies comprised a substantial proportion of the population, with a statistically significant difference in viral positivity rate compared with the immunocompetent population (27.5% vs. 57.1%, p\n < 0.05). The importance of respiratory viruses in patients with haematological malignancies is well known; additionally other viruses as cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and HHV-6 has been evaluated as potential pathogens [14], [16], [17].",

We found unexpectedly a rather high prevalence of hCoV in adults in comparison with literature (around 1% mostly in throat and nose swabs vs. around 6% mostly in BAL fluids) [3], [4], [8], [9]. The ability of these \u2018common-cold\u2019 viruses, including hCoV and hRV, to cause lower respiratory tract diseases and pneumonia has been previously reported [8], [9], [18], [19], [20]. A well known example is the SARS-hCoV which causes severe acute respiratory infections in humans and was responsible for a global outbreak in 2002\u20132003 [21], [22], [23].",
