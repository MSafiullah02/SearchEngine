The World Health Organization ranks respiratory diseases as the second\u2010leading cause of death worldwide for children in this age group [Bryce et al., 2005]. In the pediatric population, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and influenza account for a majority of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, although the cause of 15\u201334% of these illnesses cannot be determined [Meissner and Rennels, 2004]. Since 2001, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has emerged, as a respiratory pathogen that causes a significant proportion of both upper and lower RTIs in infants and children [Van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Esper et al., 2003].",

Few population\u2010based estimates of the incidence of these viruses in developing countries are available. In addition, clear data are lacking on seasonality, severity, and case\u2010fatality rates of these viruses. The acquisition and spread of respiratory viral infections among individuals has been attributed to several risk factors such as large family size, lateness in the birth order, crowding within the home, low birth weight, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, lack of breast feeding, pollution, and youth [Weber et al., 1999]. However, these factors vary considerably among different study populations in different countries. The variations can be due to cultural and socioeconomic factors, geographical or climatic differences, or variations in health care systems. A clear understanding of the local epidemiology of the disease and identifying risk factors is critical for the successful implementation of a prevention and control program.",

Bronchiolitis was defined as a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs including a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing in children less than 2 years of age [American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006]. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of fever, acute respiratory symptoms, or both, plus evidence of parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiography [Mclntosh, 2002]. The exclusion criteria for this study were known immunosuppressive conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); cancer or chemotherapy; hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders; chronic use of high dose systemic corticosteroids (>30 mg/day for more than 2 weeks in the preceding 4 weeks); and children with symptoms of a respiratory infection starting 7 days after hospitalization. Written consent was obtained from their parents. A detailed epidemiological questionnaire, which included information on demographics, clinical presentation, medical history, and risk factors for respiratory illnesses, was completed by the treating physician. Furthermore, research and ethics approval was sought and granted by the College of Medicine and Health Sciences Research and Ethics Committee at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.",

In the present study, respiratory viruses were detected in 50% of children hospitalized with symptoms and signs of acute RTIs. The leading cause of hospitalization was RSV A and B followed by adenovirus and PIV. Globally in 2005, an estimated 66,000\u2013199,999 children younger than 5 years of age died from acute lower RTIs caused by RSV, with most of these deaths occurring in developing countries [Naira et al., 2010]. The burden of RSV in developing countries has been substantial and varies from one country to another, probably due to socioeconomic factors and health care patterns. This study demonstrates that RSV causes significant morbidity in Omani children \u22645 years of age with higher rates of infection than those reported from countries within the region, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt [Al\u2010Hajjar et al., 1998; Khadadah et al., 2010; Fattouh et al., 2011]. The higher detection rate can be attributed to the use of more sensitive molecular\u2010based diagnostic assays in the current study. In a recent study by Ali et al. [2010], the prevalence of RSV infection detected by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR was 64%.",

The predominance of RSV infection in infants has been clearly documented in several other studies where RSV lower RTIs were common among infants less than 6 months of age [Rossi et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2009; Houben et al., 2010]. In these studies premature infants with birth weights less than 2.5 kg, and infants with chronic lung disease due to prematurity constitute high\u2010risk groups with rates of RSV hospitalization that are approximately five times the hospitalization rate of full term, healthy infants [Meissner, 2003; Weisman, 2003].

Ninety percent of infants with RSV infection were admitted with a diagnosis of lower RTIs while 50% had bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract illness in children <24 months of age and the most frequent cause of hospitalization in infants under 6 months of age [Wagner, 2009]. Recent studies have indicated that hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis have significantly increased in the last several years mainly due to RSV infections [Garc\u00eda et al., 2010]. In a study from the Saudi Arabia, 80% of children <6 months of age hospitalized with bronchiolitis had RSV infection.

This is attributed to the fact that December is the coldest month in Oman. Viral prevalence did not differ in the dry and rainy seasons, as the weather in Oman is mostly dry. In a study from Qatar, a country with a similar climate to Oman, respiratory viruses, particularly RSV epidemics, occurred yearly during the winter months with peak hospitalizations occurring between November and February [Wahab et al., 2001]. The seasonality of RSV infection has been well documented. In temperate climates, RSV activity peaks in the winter months but may occur throughout the year in equatorial areas [Stensballe et al., 2003; Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010)]. In tropical and subtropical areas, RSV infection increases mostly in wet seasons [Mathisen et al., 2009].",

Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has been highly indicated for RSV prevention in high\u2010risk infants, including those with chronic lung disease, those with congenital heart disease, and those born prematurely [Bocchini et al., 2009; Empey and Peebles, 2010]. In the current study, only 20% of hospitalized infants and young children with RSV infection were premature. Several studies have shown that the majority of infants hospitalized with severe RSV disease are term infants with no underlying risk factors, and therefore are not considered candidates for palivizumab therapy. Clinical trials on several other novel treatments are ongoing.",

            "text": "Prevention remains the most important measure for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory viruses, and their significant burden on the health care system. The obvious choice for the prevention of serious RSV infections would be the development of a vaccine. However, vaccines that have been developed against RSV are either inactivated or live\u2010attenuated. Those that are inactivated produce high levels of serum antibody causing more severe infections than the wild virus. Those that are live\u2010attenuated are too reactive or overly attenuated [Nair et al., 2011]. Thus the best preventive measures currently available are infection control measures and immunoprophylaxis with a monoclonal antibody for high\u2010risk groups. Of the infection control measures employed, hand washing is the most important and the least expensive [Isaacs et al., 1991]. Other possible infection control procedures include isolation or cohorting of infected infants and improving nurse to patient ratios.",

However, the bias was minimized as the study attempted to include all patients seen at SQUH over the 1\u2010year study period. This study is also largely underpowered in some respects due to the small sample size, which may not be powerful enough to detect clinically meaningful corollary effects. The fact that other important causes of RTIs among children, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were not excluded, could have affected the study results.",

            "text": "In Oman, most respiratory viruses circulate throughout the year with peaks in winter months, causing substantial social and economic impacts. RSV is the predominant cause of pediatric viral RTIs. For most of these viruses, treatment remains exclusively supportive. Thus, prevention remains the cornerstone of disease management. Currently, immunoprophylaxis for RSV infections is available. Guidelines published by the American Association of Pediatrics [American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009] have been adopted widely in developed countries to protect high\u2010risk groups, but their implementation in this region has been hindered due to the high cost of the RSV monoclonal antibody and lack of epidemiological studies. The results of this study have important policy implications in the region. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need for the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies including vaccines and effective pharmacotherapy. The implementation of these strategies should remain a high priority.",
