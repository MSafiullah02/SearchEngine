This study builds upon individual reports that have demonstrated independent risk factors for osteonecrosis, which were not observed in earlier studies 2., 20., 66., 72.. Our results showed that osteonecrosis incidences were affected by treatment with corticosteroids, corticosteroid doses, and patient age. Specifically, patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids may be up to ten times as likely to develop osteonecrosis, and cumulative doses greater than 10 g may increase the likelihood of developing osteonecrosis by two-fold, compared to cumulative doses less than 10 g. In addition, it was observed in the regression analysis that the correlation between corticosteroid dose and osteonecrosis incidence was most evident in SLE patients. However, no differences between diagnoses were noted using the analysis of variance, and further study is needed before a stronger conclusion can be drawn.",

A prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study by Shigemura et al demonstrated that SLE patients had significantly higher risk (RR 2.1) of osteonecrosis than non-SLE patients (37 versus 21%; P\n = 0.001) [66]. However, they excluded organ transplant recipients due to higher mortality rates, and relied primarily on other systemic inflammatory diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases, vasculitides, dermatologic autoimmune diseases) as comparison groups. Furthermore, Leiberman et al reported low incidences (3%) of osteonecrosis diagnosed with MRI at a mean of 31 months post-liver transplantation [47]. Presently, the true effect of underlying disease on osteonecrosis incidence remains to be determined, and additional prospective studies are needed.",

            "text": "In addition to differences in diagnosis, it is important to highlight the effects of demographic factors and race on the development of osteonecrosis. Although it is difficult to specify osteonecrosis rates in a whole population, some studies have evaluated osteonecrosis in Asian populations and have shown higher disease incidence, particularly in those who have corticosteroid-dependent conditions. For example, Yamaguchi et al demonstrated a rising trend in the incidence of nontraumatic ON in Japanese patients, particularly in those who had corticosteroid-dependent conditions, with rates of up to 44% in SLE patients who were on high-dose corticosteroids [74]. However, it was inconclusive whether this was a true trend or just an improvement in diagnostic capabilities. In addition, Fukushima et al observed that according to the Research Committee on Idiopathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in Japan, roughly 2200 new patients per year were diagnosed with ON. Comparatively, United States-based studies have shown much lower ON rates, with roughly a 15% ON prevalence in SLE patients [75]. Race-specific differences in gene mutations, such as factor V Leiden and prothrombin, have been implicated, however, definitive causes for disparities in incidence remain unclear, and may also be idiopathic or attributed to lifestyle [76]. Nevertheless, it is still important to highlight that there may be fundamental differences in the way certain patients respond to corticosteroids.",

In addition, mean daily doses of greater than 40 mg per day (prednisone-equivalent) have been associated with a higher risk for developing osteonecrosis. One prospective study demonstrated 4-fold higher incidences of osteonecrosis in patients treated with mean daily corticosteroid doses of greater than 40 mg (P\n < 0.05) [66]. Nagasawa et al, in a study of 45 patients diagnosed with SLE and treated with oral prednisolone (40 mg/day), observed dose\u2013response relationships with osteonecrosis over five years [77]. Based on yearly MRI scans, they found that administration of high corticosteroid doses (> 1000 mg/day) was more frequently found in patients with early stage osteonecrosis than those without osteonecrosis (87% versus 37%; P\n < 0.01). It is possible that discrepancies between studies may be attributed to recent increases in MRI use for the diagnosis of early-stage osteonecrosis, which may have otherwise been undetectable on radiographic assessment.",

For example, previous reports suggest that patients receiving greater than 2 g of cumulative corticosteroid doses are at a higher risk for developing osteonecrosis 1., 3.. However, it is unclear whether this represents a ceiling above which patients develop osteonecrosis at the same rates irrespective of total doses, or a floor, above which risk for osteonecrosis increases with higher cumulative doses. Additionally, Nakamura et al evaluated 201 patients with SLE over 13 years and observed that osteonecrosis risk was associated with increasing cumulative corticosteroid doses, with 15% of patients requiring increased corticosteroid doses developing the disease [39]. Shibatani and colleagues evaluated renal transplant recipients who underwent multiple rejection cycles, and they demonstrated associations between osteonecrosis and cumulative corticosteroid doses (OR 4.2; P\n = 0.008), but not with rejection episode numbers, which allude to the likelihood that higher cumulative doses, rather than systemic effects of host-versus-graft disease, may be implicated in osteonecrosis pathogenesis [60]. However, accurate differentiation between effects of mean daily corticosteroid doses and cumulative doses on the osteonecrosis risk is difficult, since patients with the highest cumulative doses often receive higher mean daily doses and/or are treated for longer durations.",

Oinuma et al, studying 72 patients with SLE, found no differences in osteonecrosis incidences in patients treated with pulsed methylprednisolone therapy in combination with minimum daily corticosteroid doses of 40 mg/day [38]. Of the 32 patients who developed ON, 17 were treated with pulsed corticosteroids while of the 40 patients who did not develop osteonecrosis, 18 were treated with pulsed corticosteroids. However, this study did not specify pulsed corticosteroid dosages. However, in a study by Ce et al, 60 multiple sclerosis patients, who did not have any risk factors for osteonecrosis, were treated with pulsed corticosteroids and were compared to a matched group of patients who did not receive corticosteroids [72]. Cumulative pulsed corticosteroid doses received by the treatment group was greater than 10 g, and they only received pulsed-corticosteroids and were not treated with any maintenance doses between pulses. It was observed that treatment patients had significantly higher incidences of femoral head osteonecrosis as diagnosed on MRI (15.5%; P\n < 0.05) compared to the non-corticosteroid group (0%). Similar results were observed in a study of 498 renal transplant patients, which demonstrated a significantly greater incidence of osteonecrosis in those receiving pulsed therapies (11%) compared to patients receiving non-pulsed therapy (3%; P\n < 0.01) [55].",

The lack of prospective randomized\u2013controlled trials may have contributed to both study-design and reporting bias in individual reports, which may have skewed the observed outcomes. Although double-blinded, prospective randomized\u2013controlled trials are gold standards for evidence-based medicine, in certain situations, such as renal transplantation or SLE, where the first-line therapy is corticosteroids, it would have been unethical to design studies denying treatment. Thus, we relied primarily on case\u2013control studies. There was also a lack of consistency in osteonecrosis diagnostic methods. Studies published after 1990 utilized MRI, while earlier studies relied on patient symptoms, radiographic findings, biopsies, and bone scanning, which due to low diagnostic sensitivity [78] may have underestimated the true osteonecrosis incidence. In addition, lower quality studies on medical diagnoses other than renal transplantation or SLE prevented multivariate analysis due to insufficient degrees of freedom in the statistical analyses. This was evident in studies on bone marrow transplant recipients, cardiac transplants, and SARS. However, we were able to analyze two common patient groups (SLE and renal transplantation). Furthermore, almost all studies reported using high cumulative corticosteroid doses. This study did not consider incidental corticosteroid doses, such as the use of dose-packs or corticosteroids in minimal doses that are typically not associated with osteonecrosis. We have focused on patients who received minimum cumulative doses of 2 g or 30 mg daily doses for less than 2 months. Thus, these results may not be indicative of patients given low cumulative doses (< 2 g) of corticosteroids for medical conditions that were not directly associated with osteonecrosis.",

Patients treated with daily doses > 40 mg were at higher risk, with 3.6% increase in incidences for every 10 mg increase in doses. Effects of cumulative corticosteroid doses and treatment durations are less clear, but are likely to have synergistic relationships with daily doses and underlying diagnoses. Pulsed-therapy has effects on increasing osteonecrosis risk. As molecular and genetic bases for this disease evolves, further knowledge of risk factors for osteonecrosis with prospective MRI-based studies will assist medical practitioners in educating patients. Presently, we would advise erring on the side of caution and using the lowest possible corticosteroid doses, while still maintaining clinical efficacy and minimizing risks.",
