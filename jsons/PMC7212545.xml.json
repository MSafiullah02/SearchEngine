            "text": "Coronaviruses, a large family of viruses, causing upper-respiratory-tract infections in humans and other higher mammals (Bedford et al., 2020). Coronavirus outbreak has been reported three times in the 21st century namely SARS in 2002, MERS in 2012, and COVID-19 in November 2019. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged from China. Human-human transmission of this highly infectious zoonotic virus has led to exponential growth in the number of infected cases, which resulted in its pandemic outbreak worldwide (Fahmi, 2020). Currently, more than 225 countries are affected due to COVID-19 with more than 2.5 million people to date which is increasing in thousands per day around the world and approximately 5 to 10% mortality rate (Fahmi, 2020). Additionally, the lives of millions of people have been impacted due to mandatory lockdowns, isolations, and quarantines. Thus the severe effect of the COVID-19 outbreak has imposed major challenges for global health, society and economy (Fry, 2020). Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available for the treatment and management of COVID-19, which is further making the situation difficult to handle. At present preventive and supportive therapies are being implemented to prevent complications (Salata et al., 2020). Several efforts are going on to target key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis like the main protease (MPro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), RNA binding N terminal domain (NTD) of Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), viral ion channel (E protein), 2\u2032-O-RiboseMethyltransferase and human Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor (hACE-2) (Gao et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). To propose or repurpose drug and/or lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2, it would be effective to target multiple virus pathogenesis specific proteins within a close network of interaction or having dependent functionality (Zhou et al., 2020).",

            "text": "For drug discovery purposes, the MPro of coronaviruses has been studied extensively. They are papain-like proteases involved in the self-maturation and processing of viral replicase enzymes (Zhang et al., 2020). MPro has 11 putative cleavage sites in 790 kD replicase lab indicating its predominance in the proteolytic processing of large polyprotein lab. MPro from SARS-CoV-2 showed high sequence identity and structural similarity to that of the SARS-CoV MPro. It contains two catalytic domains, I (chymotrypsin) and II (picornavirus 3 C protease-like) each containing six-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrel containing active diad H41 and C145. Since they have a key role in virus replication, these proteases have emerged as important drug targets. Furthermore, with their very low similarity with human proteases, inhibitors of MPro are found to be very less cytotoxic (Anand et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2020). Preliminary studies have suggested the potential use of protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, commonly used drugs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for the treatment of COVID-19 patients (Cao et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, in the open-label randomized clinical study, these drugs are not found to be that impressive for COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, several other viral protease inhibitors like HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir, HIV protease inhibitor Darunavir are under in vivo and clinical studies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Dong et al., 2020). To find new or repositioning existing drug molecules, the understanding of sequence and structure of SARS-CoV- MPro in regards to various other coronavirus strains could be important. Their comparative understanding is enigmatic, which could be important to repurpose available antiviral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 MPro.",

Of these, RdRp or Nsp12 catalyzes the synthesis and is known to play an important role in the replication and transcription cycle of the virus. RdRp is a primary target for nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors such as Remdesivir, a drug under evaluation for SARS-CoV2 infection in clinics (Gao et al., 2020; Imbert et al., 2006). Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities, and preclinical studies have also shown promising human safety data (Amirian & Levy, 2020; Dong et al., 2020). Recently, a report suggested that the significant inhibition of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 by Remdesivir, and clinical studies for the same are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of this molecule in the COVID-19 patients (www.clinicaltrials.gov; Study No: NCT04280705).",

Since this host cell receptor is essential for the virus entry; targeting hACE-2 has a promise for preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection. It has been shown that clinically approved serine protease inhibitor (TMPRSS2) can also bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE-2 and inhibit viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020). To date, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry has recorded around 550 trials against SARS-CoV-2, mostly evaluating existing drug molecules. These trials include the application of antiviral (favipiravir, adalimumab, dihydroartemisininpiperaquine, leflunomide, lopinavir), antimalarial drugs (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine), high\u2011dose vitamin C, etc (www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx). From the available data of experimental and clinical studies, it has been found that molecules targeting single protein will be ineffective antiviral lead. Thus, to devise an effective strategy, there is a need for molecules that can target multiple key proteins such as RdRp and hACE-2 along with the MPro as a major drug target (Wu et al., 2020).",

This enables to shortlist leads and thus meet the urgent demand for repurposing drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, in this study, we have performed a comparative analysis of the major target of SARS-CoV-2, MPro for its structural characteristics to other viruses from the Coronoviridea family. This information was further used for the virtual screening of the custom-made library of phytochemicals, active ingredients present in the commonly used ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines in India, and the synthetic anti-viral drugs against MPro. Top hit molecules from this screen were then docked against SARS-CoV-2 RdRP and hACE2 to find the multi-target-directed molecules. We believe that this study will provide a new approach and a base for the discovery of multi-targeted antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Thus these compounds could be potential candidates for in vitro and in vivo anti-viral studies followed by clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2.",

In the clade 2 (cyan), most of the sequences are from the strains of Avian infectious bronchitis virus. It is then followed by clade 3 (blue), which mainly consists of the sequences from different strains of Bat coronavirus. It is also found to be the parental clade for the clade 4 (red) and the clade 5 (green), which consist of predominantly mammalian host coronaviruses. It is interesting to see that the clade 4, which comprises viruses from bats and the majority of human infectious coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and also recent SARS-CoV-2. Our phylogenetic analysis revalidated the bat origin of the SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al., 2020). While the clade 5 has sequences from Bovine coronaviruses, it also has subclades that are indicative of a distinct host range. Part of the Clade 5 is from the bovine coronavirus and the other part is from murine coronavirus. Between these two subclades, there is a set of sequences that forms clad 5.2 comprises of human coronaviruses like strain OC43 (P0C6U7) and HKU1 (P0C6X3) which have bovine or murine as primary or intermediate host (Figure 1A). As evident in the multiple sequence alignment (Supplementary Figure 1), the MPro sequences from various coronaviruses strains showed very high conservation in the active site. Also, sequences of MPro from isolates of SARS-CoV-2 viral strain showed high identity. However, the sequence variation around the active site can lead to the separation of these proteases in distinct clades depending on their hosts.",

At e-value 1E-140, the sequences were segregated in 5 clusters (Figure 1B). The largest cluster (green) consisted of sequences from bovine coronavirus, murine coronavirus and some human coronavirus such as OC43 and HKU1. The second cluster (orange) exclusively consisted of the porcine coronaviruses and related strains. Bat coronaviruses were grouped in a single cluster (blue), while cyan cluster housed avian coronaviruses. The red cluster consisted of human coronaviruses including SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 along with various other bat coronaviruses. The small cluster of 2 sequences that separated from the red cluster at e-value 1E-125 also belongs to the bat coronaviruses. The clusters of SSN are showing a high correlation with the clades of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A) suggesting high evolutionary divergence amongst the coronaviruses depending on their host reservoir. This high specificity of the variations related to the host might have resulted from the natural selection in the animal hosts before human transmission (Andersen et al., 2020).",

Furthermore, a comparison of the substrate-binding pocket of these selected proteases shows that active site residue conformation is highly conserved (Figure 2D). There are some variations in the binding pocket residues as shown in the multiple sequence alignment, but these variations are subtle, and overall binding pocket conformation is conserved. Structural conservation of backbone and binding pocket of MPro from various coronavirus strains suggest that substrate recognition and inhibitor binding would more or less likely to be similar in them.

To validate the flexibility of the beta-barrels, the normal mode simulation was performed to map the Root Means Square Fluctuations of the residues from its mean position. Structural trajectory and the fluctuation map indicate that most of the residues present in the beta barrels have fluctuation above 1 \u00c5, while the C-terminus is mostly rigid with very few residues having fluctuation above 1 \u00c5 (Figure 3D and 3E).

Sequence similarity search of MPro against human protein sequences was performed, which suggests that the viral proteases do not have any homolog in the human, thus targeting MPro will be specific to viral proteases only. Docking analysis results demonstrated that several phytochemicals and anti-viral have strong binding in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. The selected molecules also displayed a high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and hACE-2 (Supplementary Data 3). Likewise MPro, other viral targets considered in this study, RdRp, also showed that there is no human homolog present, thus could be a potential viral target with MPro. Top molecules with the highest binding energy and with acceptable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) criteria were further selected for interaction analysis (Figure 4).

TYR54, PHE140, GLY143, HIS163 and GLU166 are involved in the formation of 6 hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl and carboxyl oxygen of ligand. Apart from this, there are other additional interactions like van der Waals forces that stabilize the binding of the ligand to the enzyme (Figure 5D). Myricitrin exhibited equally strong interaction with RdRp and hACE-2 with a binding score of -7.9 and -7.5 Kcal/mol, respectively. For RdRp, the carboxyl group of myricitrin forms two hydrogen bonds with ARG553, ARG555 and THR556. While the active site residue ASP623 is having Pi-Anion interaction with the aromatic rings of the ligand. Similarly, this ligand binds to hACE-2 by forming polar interaction with ALA348, PHE390, ARG393 and ASN394.

Asymmetrical structural flexibility in the MPro might be crucial for its activity, thus it can be targeted for inhibition.

The dendrogram was built based on similarity Z-score and the similarity matrix was built based on structural conservation. Representation of the similarity matrix was obtained using Multiple Experimental Viewer (Mev) software. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering of the similarity matrix was performed and compared with the dendrogram. Representative structure from each cluster was then superimposed and compared with COVID MPro using MatchMaker in Chimera 1.10.2 software. The structural backbone and active site conservation representation was obtained by Chimera 1.10.2 software (Pettersen et al., 2004).",
