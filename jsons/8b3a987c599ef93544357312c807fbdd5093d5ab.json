However, the antiviral effect and mechanisms of IFITMs in response to viral infections remain incompletely understood and characterized. In this work, we focused our investigation on the function of the extracellular IFITM3 protein. In cell models of DENV-2 infection, we found that IFITM3 contributed to both the baseline and interferon-induced inhibition of DENV entry. Most importantly, our",

Thus, our findings provide new insights in the basic mechanisms underlying the actions of IFITM3, which might lead to future development of exosome-mediated anti-viral strategies using IFITM3 as a therapeutic agent. Conceivably, variations in the basal and inducible levels of IFITMs, as well as in intracellular and extracellular levels of IFITMs, might predict the severity of dengue virus infections among individuals or across species.",

DENV is the aetiologic agent of dengue fever (DF), the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans with more than 50-100 million cases worldwide annually. DENV is transmitted by mosquito Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus in the tropical and subtropical regions, where these mosquitoes are endemic, placing 2.5 billion people at risk of infection globally (Guzman et al., 2010; Simmons et al., 2012) . Of note, 1% of infected individuals develop more severe, and often lethal, syndromes, designated dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), with children bearing most of the disease burden Guzman et al., 2010) . While genotypic differences of DENVs have been indicated to be associated with variations in viral virulence, heterotypic dengue virus antibodies are believed to be a risk factor for the development of DHF or DSS in secondary infections (Guzman et al., 2010) . Despite the formidable toll imposed by DENV on world health, no approved vaccine or effective specific anti-DENV therapies are currently available for DENV infection (Halstead, 2005; Guzman et al., 2010) .",

IFN inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITM1, 2 and 3) have recently been identified as antiviral mediators induced by IFN, to confer host cells resistance to a variety of pathogenic viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Everitt et al., 2012) , West Nile virus (Brass et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010) , DENV (Brass et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2012) , vesicular stomatitis virus , Marburg virus (Huang et al., 2011) , Ebola virus (Huang et al., 2011) , SARS coronavirus (Huang et al., 2011) , human immunodeficiency virus (Lu et al., 2011 ) and hepatitis C virus (Yao et al., 2012) . Mechanistically, IFITMs are the only known ISG products that act to restrict the entry step of viral infection process (Feeley et al., 2011) . In particular, Brass et al. demonstrated that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly effected as an essential barrier to IAV infection in vitro, in a knockout mouse model and in humans, by blocking the virus-cellular membrane fusion and thus preventing cytosolic entry of the virus (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Everitt et al., 2012) . Interestingly, another study revealed that IFITM proteins could interfere with the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect during secondary dengue virus infection, which bypassed the IFN-mediated restriction (Chan et al., 2012) . Taken together, these previous studies have defined IFITM3 as a mediator required for the anti-viral action of IFN, representing a key component of human anti-viral defence system, probably through targeting an early step of viral infection. Open questions, however, remain concerning the detailed biological functions of IFITM in IFN-triggered cascades and the precise mechanisms how the host cellular defence system is involved in IFITM activation in response to viral infections. Such knowledge will provide insights in designing new antiviral therapeutics using IFITM proteins. Furthermore, it is worth noting that secreted or membrane-bound proteins are of particular interest in drug development, because their extracellular nature renders them more accessible for therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "As a novel alternative secretion system, exosomes are small vesicles (30-100 nm in diameter) of endocytic origin that are released from cell into the extracellular environment, under both normal and pathological conditions (Thery et al., 2002) . Exosomes are formed through the inward budding of late endosomal membrane that gives rise to intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which involve their fusion with the plasma membrane and release of MVBs into the extracellular environment as exosome (Thery et al., 2002) . Prior work has focused on exosome as a new family member of 'bioactive vesi-cles' that function to promote intercellular communication, by shuttling for proteins, lipids and RNAs of the cells, and participate in various biological processes including immunomodulatory events (Schorey and Bhatnagar, 2008) . While shuttling for components of pathogenic microbes, exosome could stimulate immune responses. For instance, exosome isolated from cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been shown to contain bacterial components and promote antigen presentation and macrophage activation (Bhatnagar and Schorey, 2007a; Bhatnagar et al., 2007b) . Moreover, exosome may also promote intercellular spreading of infectious cargo, such as the observed cell-to-cell transmission of HIV (Gould et al., 2003; Izquierdo-Useros et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, despite these advances in our understanding of the functions of exosome, the physiological significance of exosome in shuttling bioactive molecules key to the host defence system remains enigmatic. More recently, Atanu et al. demonstrated that APOBEC3G, which belongs to an ISG family of cellular cytidine deaminases that effect to restrict replication of a variety of exogenous retroviruses, was exported by exosome and conferred antiviral phenotype to recipient cells (Khatua et al., 2009). Li et al. propose an antiviral mechanism of IFN-\u03b1 activity that involves the induction and intercellular transfer of antiviral molecules (such as LAMP-2 protein, APOBEC3G proteins, IFI6 mRNA, DDIT3 mRNA, hsa-miR-638, hsa-miR-4284 and hsa-miR-1260 etc.) from liver non-parenchymal cells to hepatocytes via exosomes, by using HBV infection as a model . They also observed similar exosome-mediated transfer of IFITM1 mRNA from macrophages to HepG2.2.15 cells, but there is not in-depth study on whether the anti-HBV activity is dependent or independent of exosome-mediated transfer of IFITM1 mRNA . It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that direct exchange of ISGs proteins transferred by exosome among host cells might contribute to the establishment of anti-viral state in uninfected cells, in addition to the direct action of IFNs stimulation.",

Next, we analysed the correlation of IFITM3 level in 8 cell lines with DENV-2 infection. We found that while endogenous IFITM3 expression was varied in different cell lines, cells expressing low level of IFITM3 protein were more susceptible to DENV-2 infection (Fig. 1B) . Further exponential regression analysis showed that the level of IFITM3 protein in host cells inversely correlated with their susceptibility to DENV-2 infection significantly (r 2 = 0.591, P = 0.026, n = 8, Fig. 1C ), suggesting that IFITM3 might be an important cellular restriction factor for DENV infection.",

Similar profound restriction was also seen when IFITM3 was transiently transduced in 293T, despite a lesser extent of IFITM3 overexpression than that of IFITM1 or IFITM2 ( Fig. S1E and F), demonstrating the potency of IFITM3 in conferring host cells resistance to DENV infection. We next examined the effect of IFITM3 on the entry step of DENV-2, and found that entry of DENV-2 was reduced by IFITM3 by approximately twofold (Fig. 5A ), as controlled with the 4G2 monoclonal neutralizing antibody to demonstrate a successful entry blockage, suggesting that the disruption of DENV replication by IFITM3 was associated with a targeted abrogation of viral entry.",

            "text": "Since IFN stimulated signalling plays a pivotal role in protecting cells from viral infection and damage, we investigated the functional significance of IFITM3 in IFNmediated anti-DENV response. As shown in Fig. S2A and B, compared with HUVEC cells transfected with control scramble siRNA, transfection of IFITM3-siRNA-1 and IFITM3-siRNA-2 efficiently depleted basal-level IFITM3 expression, and increased the permissiveness of the transfected cells to DENV-2 infection, as indicated by a > 2-fold increase of infection, in HUVEC that constitutively express high basal level of endogenous IFITM3 expression. Similar effect of IFITM3 depletion was reproducible in another cell model, in which the basal IFITM3 level is low but greatly inducible by IFN-\u03b1. siRNA silencing of IFITM3 markedly attenuated the protective effect of IFN-\u03b1 against DENV-2 infection in HeLa cells, leading to profoundly increased infection by DENV-2 in the presence of IFN-\u03b1, by 5.9-or 7.2-fold ( Fig. S2C and D) , indicating that the depletion of IFITM3 could decrease the antiviral actions of IFN-\u03b1. We also performed DENV binding/entry assay following knockdown of IFITM3 expression. Our results showed no effect of siRNA silencing of IFITM3 on the binding of DENV-2 to HeLa cells, but the penetration of DENV-2 into cells was significantly promoted by the depletion of IFITM3 (Fig. S2E) . Thus, our results suggest that IFITM3 is involved in mediating IFN-induced cellular response against DENV infection.",

Cell culture supernatants of HUVEC or HepG2 cells transfected with IFITM3 siRNA-1 (HUVEC-siIFITM3 or HepG2-siIFITM3), from HUVEC or HepG2 transfected with non-targeting control siRNA (HUVEC-siNC or HepG2-siNC), from293T cells transfected with pcDNA3 (293T-Vector), or from 293T cells transfected with the pcDNA-IFITM1, 2, 3-Flag construct (293T-IFITM1, 2, 3) for 48 h, were collected and concentrated for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using an anti-IFITM3 antibody, with cell lysates as positive control. E. Electron micrographs of crude exosomes negatively stained with uranyl acetate and examined at 80 kV are shown. F. Purified IFITM3-containing exosomes derived from each group of cells above described were analysed by immunoblotting with anti-IFITM3, anti-flotillin-2, anti-CD63, anti-calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum, ER marker) and anti-GM130 (Golgi marker) antibodies. IFITM3 is identified in the exosomes derived from each group of cells as indicated. mechanism. To achieve this, exosomes were prepared from the culture media of HUVEC, HUVEC-siNC cells, HUVEC-siIFITM3 cells, IFN-\u03b1-treated 293T cells (293T-IFN), 293T-IFITM3 cells, 293T-Vector cells and 293T cells, and subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The electron microscopic examination of the exosomes revealed vesicles ranging in size from 30 nm to 100 nm (Fig. 2E) . Interestingly, IFITM3 was detected in exosomes purified from the culture supernatant of HUVEC and HUVEC-siNC cells, and was also abundant in those produced by 293T-IFITM3 or 293T-IFN cells. In contrary, however, exosomes isolated from the 293T cells, 293T-vector cells and HUVEC-siIFITM3 cells did not contain detectable IFITM3 (Fig. 2F ). Purified exosomes were further characterized for the presence of conventional markers for exsosomes, namely, flotillin-2 and CD63, and non-exosomal markers calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum marker) and GM130 (Golgi matrix marker) using Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 2F , exosomes collected from each group was shown to be positive for flotillin-2 and CD63, but negative for calnexin and GM130, verifying that there is no contamination by other subcellular fractions in the purified exosome preparations. The IFITM3 protein contained in exosome composition was further verified by mass spectrometry (Fig. S3 ). Together, our data demonstrate that secretion of IFITM3 in exosome is not limited to HUVEC that express high level of endogenous IFITM3, but also by 293T cells undergoing IFN stimulation or transiently expressing exogenous IFITM3.",

In this study, we tested such a possibility by incubating HeLa cells, which express a low-level of IFITM3, with exosomes collected from HUVEC, HUVEC-siNC, HUVEC-siIFITM3, 293T-IFITM3 or 293T-IFN cells. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3A , an increased abundance of IFITM3 was detected in the recipient HeLa cells treated with HUVEC-, 293T-IFITM3 cell-, or 293T-IFN cellderived exosomes (60 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ), but not with those from 293T-Vector cells. Moreover, detection of IFITM3 proteins in the lysates of recipient HeLa cells treated with IFITM3-laden exosomes derived from 293T-IFITM3 and HUVEC cells, as determined by immunoblotting, was dose-and time-dependent ( Fig. 3C and D) . Notably, as it was reported that exosomes might be capable of delivering exogenous small RNA such as siRNA and microRNA in vitro and in vivo (van den Boorn et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2012; Shtam et al., 2013) , in this experiment we preformed the protein transfer assay in recipient HeLa cells transfected with IFITM3-siRNA (HeLa-siIFITM3) to rule out the potential side-effect of IFITM3-siRNA possibly delivered by exosomes on the endogenous or exosome-delivered IFITM mRNA in the recipient cells, Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3B and D, increased abundance of IFITM3 was detected in the recipient HeLa-siIFITM3 cells treated with HUVEC-siNCderived exosomes in a time-dependent manner, but not in those treated with HUVEC-siIFITM3 cell-derived exosomes.",

In contrast, our results showed that 293T-IFITM3 cell-derived exosomes did not change IFITM1 and IFITM2 expression in the recipient HeLa cells, when compared with treatments of 293T cell-or 293T-Vector cells-derived exosomes (Fig. S4) . Moreover, when the exosome treatments were terminated at 12 h, further incubation with blank culture media for a total length of 24 or 48 h did not increase the amount of endogenous IFITM3 within the recipient HeLa cells (Fig. 3F) , suggesting that the exosome treatment procedure per se does not change endogenous IFITM3 expression in the recipient HeLa cells. In addition, in order to verify that the increased IFITM3 protein level in the transfer recipient cells was due to the exosomal transfer of IFITM3, rather than a stimulated expression of endogenous IFITM3, we measured IFITM3 mRNA levels in cells treated with IFITM3-exosomes using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and we found that IFITM3-exosome treatment did not induce an increase of endogenous IFITM3 mRNA in HeLa cells (Fig. 3G) . Furthermore, to evaluate the half-life of IFITM3 in cell culture supernatant, we quantified IFITM3 protein in the supernatant of cultured HUVEC at various time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h) using Western blotting. Specifically, supernatants derived from HUVEC cells were collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, and then further centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cells and cell debris, followed by filtration with 0.22 \u03bcm filters. The obtained supernatants were then concentrated by 10-fold using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with 10 kDa cut-off value, divided into 8 groups, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h, respectively, before being subjected to Western blotting analysis using an anti-IFITM3 antibody. As shown in the Fig. S5 , there was no or little change of the IFITM3 protein in the Inter-cellular transfer of IFITM3-containing exosome. HeLa cells were incubated with purified 60 \u03bcg ml \u22121 exosomes derived from supernatants of cultured HUVEC, HUVEC-siNC, 293T-IFITM3 or 293T-IFN cells in serum-free media for 24 h (A), incubated with increasing amounts of exosomes derived from 293T-IFITM3 cells for 24 h (C), incubated with 60 \u03bcg ml \u22121 IFITM3-exosomes derived from 293T-IFITM3 cells or HUVEC for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h (D), or incubated with 60 \u03bcg ml \u22121 IFITM3-exosomes derived from 293T-IFITM3 cells for 12 h, followed by washing exosomes after 12 h treatment (F).

Purified IFITM3containing exosomes were used to treat HeLa cells that were simultaneously infected with DENV-2 (moi = 2). At 24 h post infection when the infected cells were examined by real-time RT-PCR assay, strikingly, DENV-2 infection was suppressed potently by the IFITM3-containing exosomes in a dose-dependent manner in parental HeLa cells (Fig. 4A ) or in HeLa cells with endogenous IFITM3 knocked down (Fig. 4C) , and the copy number of DENV-2 viral RNA was reduced in the culture supernatant ( Fig. 4B and D), indicating that the observed antiviral effect was mediated by the exosome-transferred IFITM3. We also performed immunofluorescence analysis of infected HeLa cells treated with, or without, IFITM3-exosomes, by staining for delivered IFITM3-Flag and a DENV protein E. As shown in Fig. S6 , our results showed that DENV protein E are present only in some cells that do not contain IFITM3-Flag. The data from the CPE reduction assay demonstrated that IFITM3-laden exosomes also attenuated CPE triggered by DENV-2 infection (Fig. 4E) . Moreover, our results showed no effect of IFITM3-exosomes on the binding of DENV-2 to host cells or post-entry steps during DENV-2 infection, but the penetration of DENV-2 into cells was significantly inhibited by the IFITM3-containing exosomes, with a reduction of approximately fourfold (Fig. 5B ). In contrast, the control exosomes prepared from 293T cells that contained only the vector plasmid without the IFITM3 expression cassette did not exhibit any anti-DENV activity, suggesting that IFITM3 was the main exosomal component responsible for the detected antiviral activity of exosome.",

Accordingly, ISGs represent a key line of defence against viral infection, and IFITMs are among the most potent ISG products with broad anti-viral spectra. A key finding of our current study, namely, that IFITM3 can be transferred intercellularly via extracellular exosome, provides new insights in the functional significance of IFITM3 as an IFN-induced anti-viral protein. The discovery of the roles of free IFITM proteins and IFITM-laden exosome as innate cellular defenders present an opportunity developing exosome-based tools to actively combat existing or emerging pathogens. Conceivably, variations in the basal and inducible levels of IFITMs, as well as in intracellular and extracellular levels of IFITMs, might predict the severity of dengue infections among individuals or across species.",

            "text": "Exosome is secreted from many types of cells and remain stable in various body environments. By transferring proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs to neighbouring or distant cells, exosome contribute to modulation of important physiological or pathological processes such as immunity, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and cell-to-cell signalling (Schorey and Bhatnagar, 2008) . Here, we propose a novel model for IFN-inducible innate immune response against DENV-2 infection mediated by IFITM-containing exosome. Noteworthy in this context is that exosome released from IFNtreated cells may remotely communicate with other cells through such a mechanism that the anti-viral phenotype can be transferred to the exosome recipient cell that might not have the chance to be directly stimulated by IFN. Interestingly, this inter-cellular communication model might also be applicable to explain a pioneering observation on the antiproliferative activity transmitted from IFNstimulated cells to non-stimulated cells (Lloyd et al., 1983) . At the subcellular level, following IFN induction of IFITM3 expression, IFITM3 is transferred to the multivesicular complexes and assembled into exosomal vesicles. Upon transport to the surface of a recipient cell, fusion of MVCs with the plasma membrane allows assembly of IFITM with a pre-existing exosome receptor complex that is unknown thus far. Potentially, the released exosome particles containing IFITM protein can travel to non-stimulated cells where receptor assembly also occurs. Such a model is consistent with the finding that the antiviral state can be transferred from IFNs induced cells to non-treated cells in culture.",

A 104 bp fragment of the DENV-2 NGC strain was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the pMD19-T Simple Vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The cloning plasmid was linearized with EcoRV, and RNA transcripts were generated with a T7 Megascript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration of transcribed RNA was determined with the NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared and used to construct a standard curve.",

Such a multiplicity of infection ensures that at least 99% of cells were infected with a minimum of one infectious viral particle. Unbound virus was removed and cells were harvested to determine the amount of viral RNA accumulation by quantitative RT-PCR 30 min later. To assess DENV-2 virus entry into cells via endocytosis, after binding on ice for 1 h, virus inocula were removed after 1 h of binding on ice, and infected cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS followed by incubation with pre-warmed DMEM for 10 min at 37\u00b0C to initiate virus cell entry. Subsequently, cells were rinsed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS and then treated with 0.25% Trypsin for 10 min, and again washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS to remove any cell-associated virus that did not enter the cytoplasm. For assessments of post-entry infection steps, after virus binding and entry procedures were finished, HeLa cells were subsequently treated with IFITM3-containing or control exosomes. Total cellular RNA was extracted to measure the quantity of viral genomes that had entered cells by using a real-time RT-PCR assay.",
