This production system comprises transportation of young calves from their birth farms to specialised units, and mixing of individuals from several different breeders. Stress due to transportation and mixing, in combination with exposure to a variety of microorganisms often leads to outbreaks of infection such as respiratory disease (Dyer, 1982). Important microorganisms include bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine corona virus (BCV), bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), bovine adenovirus (BAV), and certain bacteria, e.g., Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida (Ames, 1997, Bengtsson and Viring, 2000, Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The acute phase response (APR) is a non-specific reaction by an individual to different kinds of tissue damage such as infection, neoplasia or trauma (Gruys et al., 1994). The tissue damage induces a cascade of events that leads to the production of acute phase proteins (APP) in the liver. Haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) are important bovine APPs, which increase in serum for example during viral and bacterial diseases (Murata et al., 2004, Petersen et al., 2004), but are absent, or present in very low levels, in healthy animals (Godson et al., 1996, Heegaard et al., 2000, G\u00e5nheim et al., 2003). Moreover, sub-clinical inflammatory disorders can induce increase in APP concentrations (Karreman et al., 2000). The concentration of fibrinogen, another APP, is increased in the plasma of animals with inflammatory disorders (McSherry et al., 1970) and has been used for many years to evaluate inflammatory disease in cattle (Eckersall and Conner, 1988). Lungworm infection (G\u00e5nheim et al., 2004), and stress due to poor housing (Alsemgeest et al., 1995), weaning, transportation and mixing (Arthington et al., 2003), can also result in increased APP concentrations in cattle.",

The results did not differ between groups indicating that an above normal leukocyte count alone is not a good indicator of disease. The significantly higher number of eosinophils in group B was probably due to the experimental inoculation with lungworm, as eosinophilia is a rather consistent finding during lungworm infection (Radostits, 2000). This result was surprising as none of the animals had a patent infection with the presence of larvae in faeces. However, the eosinophilia indicates that the immune system of the calves had responded to the parasites. Thus, the lungworm infection may be one factor responsible for the elevated APP levels observed in group B, as lungworm infection can induce production of APP (G\u00e5nheim et al., 2004).",

At present, routine use of APP analyses at the herd level is not realistic because of the high costs involved. However, pooling of serum from several animals in a herd may offer a way to minimize the costs. If less expensive analytical methods become available, the calculation of mean APR scores could be a useful tool for the evaluation of herd health. However, to provide the best evaluation of health status in a herd, or in a group of animals, frequent samplings during the whole rearing period should be made and again this is probably not a realistic approach as it would be too expensive. Sampling during the first weeks after arrival in the herd would give an indication of the pressure of infections and/or stress during transportation and mixing and so may not give a fair picture of the management conditions of the actual farm. In our opinion, samplings at, for example, monthly intervals during the middle and later stages of the rearing period may be more relevant if the main interest is to evaluate the animal health conditions of a specific farm. The establishment of suitable APP or APR score thresholds for herd health would require analysis of a much larger number of herds.",
