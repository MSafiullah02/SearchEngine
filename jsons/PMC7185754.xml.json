Long exposure time in the aircraft cabin environment containing contaminant such as pathogenic aerosol may make passengers sick. Mangili and Gendreau (2005) evaluates the risk of respirable infectious disease (Tuberculosis-TB and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-SARS) transmission in commercial aircraft cabins and concluded that air travel is an important factor in the spread of respirable infectious diseases worldwide. In addition, the high passenger density (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005) and lower personal fresh air rate than for the buildings environment result in a high concentration of CO2 (Haghighat et al., 1999). And the use of various cleaning products in the cabin leads to a high concentration of VOCs such as ethanol and acetone (Nagda and Rector, 2003). These particulate and gaseous pollutants can be removed by the cabin ventilation system. Therefore, to provide a healthy and comfortable cabin environment for passengers, and to design better ventilation system, it is important to study the feature of contaminant distributions in the cabin.",

Our review finds that most of the measurement studies adopted mock up cabins which may not represent actual contaminant distribution in airliner cabins. Some used water-filled scaled model, but the different scale and working fluid further complicate the equivalent analysis for the full scale cabin environment (Thatcher et al., 2004). In addition, the two main points missing consideration in previous experimental studies are: First, how to set the contaminant source was not clearly described, which would influence the concentration distribution. Second, the number of sampling points was usually limited, and whether they were enough for obtaining complete and accurate fields for simulation validation was not discussed.",

Numerical simulation is another important way to study the pollutant transport and distribution due to its cost, time and labor saving nature compared with the experimental method (Pepper and Wang, 2011, Zhai et al., 2012). However, one numerical model must be validated before it can be applied for design or research purpose. Yan et al. (2009) found the simulation results of tracer gas transport cannot be clearly indicated by the experimental data possibly due to the \u201csampling points were too coarse to describe the concentration gradient\u201d. Wan et al. (2009) also discussed the measurement uncertainty because of low particle concentration while comparing with the numerical results. In Zhang's et al. (2009) study, the predicted tracer gas and particle concentration did not agree well with the measurement which may be due to the measurement uncertainty caused by unstable airflow. In summary, there is a general agreement that an accurate and complete measurement is essential for numerical method validation.",

Although CO2 is commonly used as a tracer gas (Zhang et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2008), its measurement can be easily disturbed by the background concentration and operators around. The low background concentration, non-reactive and nontoxic nature and easy detectability of SF6 make it ideal as a tracer gas to simulate gas contaminant (Zhang et al., 2009) and often used to measure ventilation rate (Cheong, 2001). In addition, the density of the 1% SF6-N2 mixed gas (1.25 kg m\u22123) is similar to that of air (1.2 kg m\u22123), so the buoyancy effect of the mixed gas can be neglected. The SF6 concentration was analyzed with a photo-acoustic multi-gas analyzer (INNOVA 1412, LumaSense Technologies).",

Since most particles stay in the room for a short time period, the size change due to evaporation is negligible (Zhang et al., 2009).

However, the different flow field over time may have already changed the pollutant fields, therefore the measured gas and particle field cannot be easily compared. In this study, the tracer gas and particles were devised to release at the same time. Because the influence of the airflow on contaminants distribution would be investigated, the contaminants were released with almost zero momentum to avoid their effects on airflow field. In addition, as the velocity field is dynamic and complex in the cabin (Liu et al., 2012), a small difference in the source locations may lead to a significant difference of contaminant fields. Therefore, two source location settings were studied. The first source setting is shown in Fig. 2(a). The particles and SF6 were released from separate sources with a distance of 10 cm between, which is the minimum length of the concentration sampling grid in the current study. The second source setting is shown in Fig. 2(b). The generation flow of particles and SF6 were same as in separate-source condition, but they were released from a single port, which was placed at the mouth of a seated passenger. The releasing port was made by a rubber bulb which had a mixing chamber to mix the contaminants uniformly.",

In addition, previous studies (Murakami et al., 1992, Zhao et al., 2004) in buildings assumed that particles with aerosol diameter less than 4.5 \u03bcm showed diffusion properties similar to those of gas with zero gravitational settling velocity. Therefore, in the current study the mean particle size generated was controlled to be 3 \u03bcm, with which the particles were most likely to spread with airflow. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) of the generated particles was less than 1.2. Meanwhile, according to Yang et al.

To reduce the labor and time cost, the second simplified sampling grid resolution was designed to be sparse, and was 0.2 m \u00d7 0.2 m for a cross section (Fig. 4(b)). To optimize the sampling point number for a complete capture of the concentration field, based on second sampling grid, the third modified sampling grid was modified with dense grid near the source and air supply inlet where the concentration gradient is higher (Fig. 4(c)). Sampling points blocked by seats were deleted in the measurement. In total, for the first grid resolution, there were actually 335 points on a lateral plane and 240 on a longitudinal plane for first-class cabin; and 360 points on a lateral plane and 540 on a longitude plane for economy-class cabin, while the total number of sampling points with the third grid resolution was reduced to about half of that. The performance of these three grid resolutions will be analyzed in next section.",

Agarwal and Liu (1980) simulated the flow field around a sampling inlet in still air to conclude that there would be less than a 10% error if probe size meets the criterion:(1)Ds\u226520\u03c42gwhere Ds in m is the probe diameter, \u03c4 in s is the particle relaxation and g in m s\u22122 is gravitational acceleration. For 10 \u03bcm particles in aerodynamic diameter, their relaxation time is about 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22125\n s, and Ds should be larger than 0.02 mm. This indicates that there is no practical restriction on still-air sampling of particles less than 10 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter. For particle concentration measurement in cabin environment, the maximum air velocity U0 for which the still-air sampling criteria can be used is defined as (Hinds, 1999):(2)U0\u226415(Q4\u03c0\u03c42)13where U0 in cm s\u22121 is air velocity, Q in L min\u22121 is the sampling flow rate (5 L min\u22121 in this study). The calculated criterion is 1.6 m s\u22121 for current study, therefore the air velocity in the cabin (Liu et al., 2012) meets the still-air sampling criteria. We utilized the conductive silicone ports and tubes with the diameter of 8 mm facing toward the back of the cabin for particle sampling. Since the sampling method was consistent throughout the experiment, the data can be normalized for comparison and analysis.",

The mean positions of SF6 and particle can be used to identify the difference (Wan et al., 2009). The experimental mean position can be determined by the following method: The measured concentration is multiplied by the position x, y or z depending on the analysis plane. The value for all points is summed and then divided by the total value of concentration to obtain the mean position. By this method, the distance between the mean position of SF6 and particle in Row 10 was 20 cm and in EC-D plane was 40 cm.

The sketch maps of smoke path are drawn in Fig. 10\n. Then it was noted that the transport direction indicated by the smoke was different for the SF6 source and for particle source. It is clearly shown in Fig. 10(a) that the smoke from particle source presented a consistent backward transport trend, while some of the smoke from the gas source diffused to the front lower parts of the cabin. The lateral view (Fig. 10(b)) also presented different paths for particle and gas sources. Most of smoke released from gas source flowed to the lower part, while most of smoke released from the particle source flowed to the upper part. Considering the same nature of smoke used for particle and SF6 sources, different airflow direction should be the only reason for affecting the pollutants path. The distance between the two sources was 10 cm as described previously. Because of the small space in the aircraft cabin and its complex air distribution pattern, such a distance was large enough to put the sources in different locations of the vortex above the seat, and therefore affected the contaminants transport and distribution.",

The distance between the calculated mean position of SF6 and particle was 4 cm for Row 2 plane and was 5 cm for FC-A plane. These values were less than or equal to the diameter of the combined bulb source. Therefore, one could consider there was not obvious difference between the mean positions of SF6 and particle. As the velocity and concentration field in first-class cabin with heated manikin is more complex than that in the economic class cabin, it is reasonable to expect that the concentration field of the two contaminants can be also consistent with each other if the combined source case were measured in the empty economic class cabin. In summary, as the velocity gradient was large in the cabin, a small difference in the source locations can lead to a significant difference of contaminant transport paths and fields. In the current study, 10 cm was large enough to lead an obvious difference. Therefore it is recommended that contaminants need to be released at exactly the same location if the two kinds of pollutants were to be studied simultaneously and compared.",

A characteristic time scale was used to indicate the effect of gravitational sedimentation on the distribution. When the sedimentation time scale of airborne particles (calculated from the vertical distance from the source to the solid surface boundary and the gravitational settling velocity) was larger than or on the same order of magnitude as characteristic diffusion time scale, indicating much slower sedimentation processes, the particle fields do not differ greatly from those at a gravitational settling velocity close to zero. In our study, the sedimentation time scale of the 3 \u03bcm airborne particles is about 1850s (height of the source 0.5 m divided by gravitational settling velocity 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22124\n m s\u22121) and the diffusion time scale is about 100 s (volume of the first cabin/airflow rate of first cabin).

This means the particle tracking behavior is worse when the frequency is higher. Therefore, we need to know only the highest frequency in order to estimate the whole tracking behavior. According to Prandtl's theory, the vibration frequency is u\u2032\u00af/l, where u\u2032\u00af is a root mean square fluctuation velocity, and l, per Shu's (1970) suggestion, should be the Kolmogorov scale as follows:(15)l=(\u03bd3\u025b)14where \u03bd is kinetic viscosity, \u025b is the turbulence eddy dissipation. As it is well expected that \u025b and u\u2032\u00af is the highest at the air inlet, where the vibration frequency should be also highest there, we obtained the u\u2032\u00af and \u025b at the inlet boundary through measurement in real cabin (Liu et al., 2012). The highest vibration frequency was 2628 Hz.",

The effect of different sampling grids and contaminant sources was compared and the tracking behavior of the particles was calculated when analyzing the differences between gaseous and particulate contaminants distribution. The major conclusions are:(1)Compared with the uniform sampling grids of 0.1 m \u00d7 0.1 m for lateral planes, and 0.1 m \u00d7 0.2 m for longitudinal planes, the modified grids were good enough for accurate and complete contaminant field measurement. Non-uniform grids were applied, meaning more sampling grids should be arranged in areas with great concentration gradient (e.g. approximately within 0.3 m from the source and diffuser locations), and coarse grids can be arranged elsewhere. Note that the modified sampling grids obtained in current study should be limited to the similar cases only as particle size and ventilation type will affect the concentration distribution therefore the optimum sampling grid. Through more advanced statistical optimum method in future study, the number of sampling points may be further reduced, while maintaining the accuracy of the measurement.(2)In the narrow cabin space, where the velocity field was dynamic and complex, the source location and buoyancy plumes from the passengers had a significant effect on the contaminant distribution. A small difference (10 cm in this study) in the source locations can lead to a significant difference in contaminant fields. Therefore if the particulate and gaseous contaminant distribution was to be studied simultaneously, they should be generated from a combined source port or the source locations should be almost identical for a fair comparison.(3)The measured concentration fields of SF6 and the 3 \u03bcm DEHS particles in first-class cabin matched with each other well in the measured sections. The tracking behavior of the different particles in airflow was analyzed. The results showed good tracking behavior for particle with diameter of 3 \u03bcm: the amplitude ratio (\u03b7) of the particle velocity v\np and the fluid velocity v\nf was 0.91, and the lag time \u03c6/\u03c9 was \u221225 \u03bcs, which resulted in almost the same concentration fields as SF6's. However, for particles with aerodynamic diameter larger than 3 \u03bcm, their distribution characteristic may be different with gas due to bad tracking behavior. These data and the tracking behavior analysis gave a more representative approach of characterizing particle performance and were crucial for choosing CFD models for the particle transport calculation.\n",
