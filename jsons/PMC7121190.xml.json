Generally, diagnostic tests are categorized into three groups: direct detection, isolation of virus, and serology tests. Direct examination methods are merely faster and examined directly for presence of virus particles, virus antigen, or viral nucleic acids. Immunofluorescence assay is extensively used for rapid identification of virus infections through detection of virus antigen or virus-specific antibodies in clinical specimens. Viral diagnosis is a crucial revolution and renders more accessible and makes it potential to standardize the recently developed diagnostic methods. Serology essentially comprises bulk of work of any virology laboratory. A serological diagnosis can be identified by increasing titers of antibody among acute and convalescent stages of infection, or by the detection of Immunoglobulin M (IgM).",

Nevertheless, during the last 20 years this technique is being utilized, due to its unique nature, making diagnosis probable through visualization of virus. Then after, introduction of ELISA then revolutionized viral diagnosis by simplifying detection and shortening the time (Torrance and Jones 1981). Molecular diagnostic tools for viral diagnosis has trialed speedy advancements in last few years (Hayden and Persing 2001), and revolutionized diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly viral diseases. The use of amplification techniques, viz. PCR, RT-PCR, or NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification) (Van Belkum and Niesters 1995) for detection of virus, genotyping, and quantification have several advantages such as high reproducibility and sensitivity, including broad dynamic range (Ebner et al. 2005, 2006). Several molecular diagnostic techniques were recently swapped by fully automated devices that use less time, maneuver smaller volumes of liquids, and provide quantified results with improved accuracy.

For that reason, in modern years, role of TEM in diagnosis of anonymous infectious agents in specific viral outbreaks or transmission clusters shifted from regular use to an initial screening test. TEM is also considered an important method for assessment of viral safety in biopharmaceutical products. Application of TEM understands the unknown viruses for which there is an imminent risk of contamination, and TEM will undeniably be functional for documenting the subsistence of viruses or virus-like particles in these cells and the products derivative from them (Roingeard et al. 2019).",

As a part of most advanced immunotechniques, an ultrasensitive colorimetric assay called magnetic nano(e)zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MagLISA) was developed, wherein silica-shelled magnetic nanobeads (MagNBs) and gold nanoparticles were pooled to monitor influenza A virus up to femtogram per milliliter concentration (Oh et al. 2018). Sensitive and specific detection of Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was developed employing specific IgM and IgG antibodies in human sera using recombinant CCHFV nucleoprotein as antigen in \u03bc-capture and IgG immune complex (IC) ELISA tests (Emmerich et al. 2018). Recently, truncated forms of HeV and NiV (Hendra and Nipah virus) G proteins as well as full-length NiV nucleocapsid (N) protein were used for detection of Hendra and Nipah virus specific antibodies in pigs. These recombinant proteins were expressed through diverse expression systems and an indirect ELISA was developed for detection (Fischer et al. 2018). A rapid diagnostic platform for colorimetric differential detection of DENV and CHIKV viral infections was recently developed with a possibility to alter clinical diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses in resource-limited settings. This platform principally facilitates consistent and accurate multiplexed detection of chikungunya and dengue IgM/IgG antibodies in human clinical samples within short stint (Wang et al. 2019).",

Distinct PCRs exists based on type of nucleic acid and information known a propos the sequences of genomes for immunodetection. Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) is one of the most significant causative agents of respiratory tract infection in children and related with high morbidity and mortality. However, very little is known with reference to effects of respiratory viral infections. A reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RPA) is nucleic acid probe based on novel isothermal amplification technique which has been widely employed to detect human RSV. The results exemplified that concurrence rates between RT-RPA assay and qRT-PCR assay for clinical samples was 96%, demonstrating that RT-RPA assay holds better diagnostic presentation on clinical samples in remote rural areas in developing countries (Xi et al. 2019). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for common respiratory viruses and for two genes (CCL8/CXCL11) is recognized to be extremely upregulated in viral infections. Notably, RNA-seq virus detection achieved 86% sensitivity compared to qPCR-based screening in asthmatic children which consequently drives immune cell airway infiltration, cellular remodeling, and alteration of asthmogenic gene expression (Wesolowska-Andersen et al. 2017). Nevertheless as a part of latest advancements on immunotechniques, isothermal reverse transcription and recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) of synthetic RNA (Ebola virus) employing paper microfluidics devices was developed initially. Later on based on RNA detection and multiplexed analysis for Ebola virus diagnostics were optimized and demonstrated with high sensitivity. Additionally, nine-spot multilayered device achieving parallel detection of three distinct RNA sequences opens a route in the direction for detection of multiple viral pathogens (Magro et al. 2017).",

The primer and probe sets were targeted for highly conserved regions of nucleoprotein (N) and polymerase (L) genes. Effective detection and high sensitivity of these assays can be effectively functional in general research and used in diagnostic process and epizootic surveillance (Faye et al. 2017). However, in recent times a fluorescent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) employing quenching probes for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was developed. Additionally, detection efficacy of QProbe RT-LAMP was comparable to that of RT-PCR assay (Azhar 2018). Furthermore this assay can as well be used as authoritative diagnostic tool for rapid detection and surveillance of MERS-CoV infections (Shirato et al. 2018). Consecutively to assist detection of ZIKV infections, and distinguish these infections from DENV and CHIKV, Trioplex real-time RT-PCR assay was recently developed. However the performance of Trioplex real-time RT-PCR assay was particularly employed for the detection of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV viruses.

In clinical laboratories, MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) and ES (electrospray) ionization methods are most frequently used as they allow ionization of analyte in considerable amounts. The combination (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) was able to detect viral pathogens (acute viral respiratory infections and influenza A viruses) usually for those viruses which are undetected by regular testing methods as well as provides rapid and detailed data (about types and subtypes of virus) in short period (Deyde et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2011). Yet another study reported that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a rapid, reagent-free, and cost-effective tool used to detect ZIKV noninvasively in heads and thoraces of intact Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with high prediction accuracies relative to quantitative RT-qPCR reaction. Perhaps this technique could be extended upon for identifying probable arbovirus hotspots to guide spatial prioritization of vector control (Fernandes et al. 2018). Recently developed surface plasma resonance (SPR) spectroscopy was developed to be a valuable optical biosensor and potential method for diagnosis of dengue virus E-protein and also for identification of antibodies to DENV antigen. The diagnosis limit, sensitivity, and selectivity of SPR sensing in DENV antigen was amazingly high. This technique was introduced as a novel 3D-PAMAM-SAM-Au multilayer thin film for future research on SPR sensing applications (Omar and Fen 2018).",

RISC in cytoplasm processes pre-miRNA into mature miRNA and regulates post-transcriptional activities. As a part of the most advanced immunotechniques, exosomal microRNAs were recently studied as potential diagnostic markers for various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serum exosomal microRNAs combined with alpha-fetoprotein as diagnostic markers of hepatocellular carcinoma (Wang et al. 2018). In another study, synthetic miRNA-based approach was developed to express neutralizing antibodies directly in lung via aerosol, to prevent from human RSV and influenza infections. Engineered mRNA-expressed antibodies prevented RSV infection. It is noteworthy that an expressing membrane-anchored broadly neutralizing antibody in lungs could potentially be promising pulmonary prophylaxis approach (Tiwari et al. 2018). In a most recent study, endogenous microRNAs (miRNA) are evolutionarily conserved and their presence in biological fluids signifies regulatory role of circulating miRNAs in pathogenesis, immune responses, and viral infections. On the other hand, noninvasive diagnostic approach, using biomarkers, currently plays a central role in early diagnosis of viral infections. Given the fact, a recent report depicted numerous circulating microRNA biomarkers viz. miR155 and miR1260 in influenza; miR12, miRVP3p, and miR184 in arboviruses; and miR29b and miR125 in hepatitis infection for diagnostic function, respectively (Ojha et al. 2019) (Table 17.1).\n",

In another study, metagenomic viral sequencing is the potential diagnostic test for influenza which also provides insights on transmission, drug resistance, evolution, and simultaneously detects other viruses. It is pertinent that Oxford Nanopore Technology was employed to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples.

CRISPR/cas9 is the latest and unique RNA targeted gene therapy successfully applied in 2007 and observed in Staphylococcus pneumonia. The CRISPR is RNA sequence repeats which targets the foreign DNA cleavage by binding to the PAM flanking sequences which mediates the endonuclease called Cas through guide RNA (g-RNA) and responsible for the double strand breaks in the host or foreign DNA and silences the gene expression by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). There are different kinds which are mediated by different cas proteins. Notably like class 2, type II has cas9 where g-RNA complements cas protein and other system, eventually class II and type V complements with cas12a and the CRISPR codes crRNA acts as guide RNA by complementing the type V cas 12 protein complex. There are other 29 CRISPER/cas systems that were identified (Makarova et al. 2015). The application of CRISPR/CAS in viral diagnostics makes a breakthrough and it increased specificity. The type V CRISPR-CAS12a is used for the detection of the viral DNA. The CAS12a is designed specific to the viral DNA. The ssDNA is tagged with a Reporter which has fluorophore and quencher on both ends. The cleavage activity of viral DNA by cas12a confers the cleavage of the ssDNA. As a result flourophore reporter, the cleavage of ssDNA emits the fluorescence which is detected by quenchers and further amplified by recombinase polymerase PCR. The technique was characterized by DETECTR. There are other methods like SHERLOCK (Gootenberg et al. 2018) which works consiently based on the Cas13 system. This tool is specially applied in the ZIKA virus diagnosis (Table 17.1).",

This CRISPR screen uncovered host factors indispensable for infection by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) which comprises human pathogens causing diverse diseases. This technique is more sensitive as compared to arrayed screens based on siRNA-mediated knockdown (Kim et al. 2018).The lenti viral-based CRISPR screen-based sg-RNA plasmid pool can be employed as potential diagnostic tool for HPV and can target other viral diseases. An automated POC system for EBV detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, employing its collateral RNA degradation subsequent to its activation was recently developed by Qin and colleagues. Followed by an automated microfluidic mixing and hybridization, nonspecific cleavage products of Cas13a were allowed to quantify by a custom-integrated fluorometer. This CRISPR-Cas13a based diagnostic method is rapid, amplification-free, simple, and sensitive, thus establishing a key technology toward a useful POC diagnostic platform (Qin et al. 2019a, b).",

It is pertinent to note that some recent advances in nanoparticle-based lateral flow immunoassay as point-of-care diagnostic tool for infectious agents and diseases has been recently developed for the detection of infectious viral agents. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technology is a paper-based, point-of-care strip biosensor designed to detect a specific analyte in virus-infected samples (Banerjee and Jaiswal 2018). AuNP-based detection techniques were reported by various groups of clinically relevant viruses with a unique focus on applied types of bio-AuNP hybrid structures, virus detection targets, and assay modalities and formats were recently developed (Draz and Shafiee 2018).",

The foremost advantages of molecular techniques are its higher sensitivity and specificity matched up with other diagnostic methods, viz. serological assays and culture methods, as well as its rapidity and possibility of automation. Nevertheless, the technological capabilities alone are inadequate if not sustained by health promotion policies to boost the consciousness a propos the significance of early detection of infectious viral diseases outbreak and its spread. In conclusion, good quality diagnosis has a cost that only developed countries can afford in regular practice so far, and this is delaying the execution of new-fangled methods in developing world and in disease endemic areas. Conversely, it is anticipated that asserted efforts may persist toward developing new high-quality tests inexpensive in low-income countries, which would considerably reinforce disease control strategies.",
