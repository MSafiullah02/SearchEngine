            "text": "In the beginning of the 1960s, Hirst [1] and Ledinko [2] reported on the exchange of genetic markers between related strains of poliovirus whose genome is composed of RNA. Although it was not precisely known at that time if the entire poliovirus genome consists of one RNA molecule and if the involvement of DNA intermediates can be absolutely excluded, these reports are commonly cited as marking the discovery of intermolecular RNA recombination, i.e., an exchange between RNA molecules with their segments. Anyway, those reports have made RNA recombination a matter of experimental research. At about the same time, the first RNA \u201creplicase\u201d (an enzyme capable of synthesizing RNA on an RNA template) was discovered in the lysates of E. coli cells infected with an RNA bacteriophage [3] and, slightly later, the exponential amplification of RNA was demonstrated in a cell-free system [4]. That system employed Q\u03b2 replicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of bacteriophage Q\u03b2, and up to date it remains the only cell-free system capable of exponentially amplifying RNA. The two discoveries occurred so synchronously that it looked as if the providence delivered to the researchers a hint to use the cell-free amplification system for studies on RNA recombination. Ironically, the two fields remained in mutual ignorance for a quarter of century. A reason for this fact was probably the failure to detect recombination between RNA phages in experiments analogous to those performed with poliovirus, resulting in a belief that no RNA recombination is possible in a prokaryotic system [5]. This view persisted until 1988, when a natural Q\u03b2 replicase-amplifiable RNA was found whose recombinant origin was unequivocally demonstrated by sequencing [6].",

            "text": "In addition to the 4217 nt-long genomic Q\u03b2 RNA, Q\u03b2 replicase amplifies a number of RQ RNAs (termed so for being Replicable by Q\u03b2 replicase), which are usually \u2a7d250 nt in length. The natural source of RQ RNAs is Q\u03b2 phage-infected E. coli cells [8], [9] or Q\u03b2 phage itself [10]. Recently, many new RQ RNAs have been selected from random [11] or artificially designed [12] sequences, or produced by in vitro RNA recombination [13], [14]. Approximately, 104 copies of a single genomic RNA molecule are produced in a Q\u03b2 phage infected E. coli cell in less than 1 h [15]. Amplification of small RQ RNAs is much faster: up to 1010 copies are produced at room temperature within 10 min in a cell-free system comprised of purified Q\u03b2 replicase and all four rNTPs [7], and this is the absolute record of the rate of nucleic acid amplification. Since its discovery, there had been numerous attempts to utilize this extremely powerful cell-free amplification system for the amplification of desired RNAs, such as mRNAs or ribozymes, but that proved not an easy task, primarily because the mechanism Q\u03b2 replicase uses to recognize its templates is not known. Like DNA amplification in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RNA is amplified by Q\u03b2 replicase exponentially. This means that in each round of replication, the number of RNA molecules increases by roughly a factor of 2, as long as replicase is in molar excess over the RNA amplified. Unlike PCR, no oligonucleotide primers and no temperature cycling are required. This is because Q\u03b2 replicase synthesizes RNA in a primer-independent manner, the product strand and its template are rendered unannealed throughout the replication round, and both the strands are available to being used as templates in the next round that commences immediately upon termination. Furthermore, unlike common DNA-directed RNA polymerases, Q\u03b2 replicase does not utilize transcriptional promoters [7]. Yet, it manifests a very high degree of selectivity in choosing which RNA to amplify: only a few of 1012 unique RNA sequences of 50\u201377 nt in length flanked by the correct 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal clusters are recognized as templates [11]. This provides a rationale for the fact that Q\u03b2 replicase does not amplify most natural RNAs, including any tested cellular RNAs or genomic RNAs of other viruses [7].",

However, unexpectedly, each fragment appeared to be capable of directing the synthesis of its respective complementary copy, although the initiator oligo(C) cluster resided on the 3\u2032 fragment only. To explore the unusual template activity of the 5\u2032 fragment, we prepared an array of its variants with altered initiation regions and found that every variant can be copied, although with varying efficiency. However, template properties of the 5\u2032 fragment variants, even those bearing oligo(C) clusters at the 3\u2032 end, turned out to be entirely different from the properties of \u201clegitimate\u201d templates, the intact RQ135 RNA and its 3\u2032 fragment. Most importantly, in contrast to the legitimate templates, none of the 5\u2032 fragment variants was capable of the GTP-dependent formation of a stable replicative complex capable of elongation in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid, a powerful inhibitor of RNA protein interactions. This was, in spite of the fact that each of the 5\u2032 fragment variants inherited a pyrimidine-rich segment of the RQ135 RNA [17] and many of them possessed the secondary structure elements thought to be diagnostic features of replicable RNAs [12], [18].",

To this end, a foreign sequence was embedded into an internal loop of an RQ RNA in such a manner as to minimally disturb the RNA tertiary structure. The first successful attempt of this sort made in 1983 [22] was given a great deal of enthusiasm by being declared to be the birth of recombinant RNA technology [23]. Later, however, it was understood that there are severe constraints on the embedded sequence: it should be highly structured and be no longer than about hundred nucleotides [24], [25]. Common mRNAs could be amplified within RQ vectors only in vivo [26] or in the presence of a coupled cell-free translation system [27]. In these cases, amplification becomes possible because translating ribosomes coat the coding (sense) strand, thereby preventing its annealing with the antisense strand. Otherwise, the complementary strands would collapse into duplex, resulting in immediate cessation of RNA synthesis. However, inasmuch as ribosomes occupy sense strands and read them in opposite direction than Q\u03b2 replicase does, only antisense strands remain available as replicase templates. Therefore, amplification becomes asymmetric and rather linear than exponential [27].",

If so, the Q\u03b2 replicase replication system could serve as an experimental model wherein replicable molecules are created within the span of the reaction time (one to few hours). However, there were facts that could hardly be reconciled with the de novo hypothesis. Thus, many RNAs isolated from the products of spontaneous synthesis turned out to be either identical to RQ RNAs isolated earlier or recombinants consisting of long pieces of other known RNAs (the above mentioned RQ120 RNA was one of them) [7].

Such a possibility was provided by the molecular colony technique (MCT), invented in this laboratory [10]. The idea of experiment was to carry out RNA amplification in a gel, rather than in solution. In this format, the copies of each replicable molecule would concentrate around the original template, giving rise to a molecular colony.

It is seen that, if the enzyme layer was cast immediately after solidification of the substrate layer (Fig. 1A), the number of RNA colonies was lower, than if it was cast 1 h later (Fig. 1B). Even fewer colonies grew if the layers were cast in a room where no experiments with RQ RNAs had been previously carried out (Fig. 1C).

The advantages of MCT as a diagnostic tool are discussed later. In this section, I will consider the utility of MCT to monitoring chemical reactions between single molecules; in particular, to studying RNA recombination. Earlier, RNA recombination was exclusively studied in vivo, using viruses and their defective genomes amplified in living cells. However, because of limitations of the in vivo systems, those studies could not answer even such basic questions as whether the recombination is performed by viral replicase, by host cell proteins, or by RNA molecules themselves. Moreover, the in vivo studies did not definitely rule out the involvement of DNA intermediates and, therefore, the possibility that recombination occurs at the DNA, rather than at the RNA, level.",

The role of the nylon membrane is to retard diffusion of RNA molecules by reversibly binding them, thereby reducing the size of RNA colonies and hence increasing the resolving power of MCT [43]. This experimental scheme provides for positive selection of recombination molecules in which the two fragments are arranged in the manner as they are in the original RQ RNA. Such molecules are replicable and produce RNA colonies whose number reflects the recombination frequency.",

To explore this alternative, the experimental scheme was modified to separate the recombination and replication events [14]. To this end, a mixture of the RNA fragments was incubated under chosen conditions and, prior to seeding on the Q\u03b2 replicase-containing agarose, the fragments were oxidized to suppress further recombination by the above mechanism. Hence, RNA colonies would only grow if recombination had occurred before the oxidation step. In the absence of Q\u03b2 replicase and rNTPs, recombination between the fragments turned out to be several orders of magnitude slower, suggesting that it is somehow catalyzed by the replicase. The residual recombination was not due to incomplete elimination of the 3\u2032 hydroxyls, as it might be expected: repeated oxidation of the fragments either before or after incubation did not change its rate. Furthermore, its mechanism appeared to be entirely different from the mechanism of the replicase-catalyzed reaction: the fragments react by internal segments not involving the 3\u2032 hydroxyls (Fig. 2B). Similar reactions can also occur in cis, resulting in deletion of internal RNA segments [14].",

This means that there must be some kind of compartmentation linking replicase to its products in order that natural selection be able to identify a gene that makes a better product [47], [48]. Mixed RNA colonies comprised of more than one RNA species and growing in moist clays or other porous solids could perform the function of such a compartment [48], [49]. This form of compartmentation is not confronted with the problem of transportation through hydrophobic barriers that inevitably arise if lipid membranes are employed [48].(2)Dissemination of RNA molecules through atmosphere [10] might be a mechanism for the lateral transfer of genetic information between RNA colonies, an equivalent of sex, which is required for a high rate of evolution [50].(3)Spontaneous recombinations and rearrangements of polyribonucleotides [14] might be a mechanism for creation of complex structures and for producing new combinations of genetic elements, generating the variability needed for natural selection [46].

The unique feature of MCT distinguishing it from other methods for nucleic acid amplification is that amplified molecules are spatially separated. This results in weakening or (given that the sample is properly diluted) complete elimination of a competition between the molecular species; allows the individual amplifiable molecules to be monitored, counted and analyzed; provides for a direct high-throughput screening of a large number of molecules; and makes the isolation of homogeneous molecule populations (cloning) possible. Therefore, the most obvious applications of MCT would seem to be cell-free molecular cloning and molecular diagnostics. Unfortunately, the structural restraints Q\u03b2 replicase imposes upon its templates and the ability of RNAs to self-recombine (see above) limit the utility of the Q\u03b2 replicase version of MCT for these purposes. However, MCT can utilize any enzymatic reaction that provides for the exponential amplification of nucleic acids [51], e.g., PCR or isothermal amplification reactions, such as 3SR (self-sustained sequence replication [52]) or SDA (strand displacement amplification [53]). The most promising results were obtained using the PCR version of MCT (PCR-MCT) [51], also termed \u201cpolony\u201d (polymerase colony) technology [54].

MCT format digitalizes the assay; it makes single target molecules visible and their quantitation straightforward, by simply counting the number of molecular colonies. MCT format has been shown to be capable of eliminating any competition between different targets, even if their ratio varies more than million-fold. It also eliminates the interference from a non-specific synthesis occurring due to mishybridization of primers with non-target nucleic acids that are often present in clinical samples in a trillion-fold excess over the assayed target (Fig. 3\n). These features greatly increase the reliability and sensitivity of molecular diagnostics as compared to those achievable by the conventional solution assays [55]. The latest experiments closely mimicking real clinical diagnostics demonstrate that PCR-MCT detects, in 100-\u03bcL human blood aliquots, 100% molecules of DNA targets and 50% molecules of RNA targets. This corresponds to the sensitivity of 1 and 2 molecules, respectively (Chetverina, H.V., Falaleeva, M.V. and Chetverin, A.B., submitted), which is the highest diagnostic sensitivity ever achieved.",

This will provide for screening the colonies for the ability of the synthesized proteins to perform a particular enzymatic reaction or to bind a particular ligand (including antigens, antibodies, or nucleic acids). In combination with ribosome display strategies [61], [62], this will provide for the in vitro selection of genes coding for proteins with desired functions, a cell-free alternative to the phage display. Compared to the traditional in vivo techniques, this is a true molecular cloning. In this case, there is no need in cloning vectors, in transformation of cells which is always very inefficient, or in isolation of the cloned nucleic acids \u2013 since each colony comprises a homogenous DNA preparation. Moreover, the colonies comprise naked RNA or DNA that can be directly analyzed in situ. In other words, MCT can do everything the traditional in vivo gene cloning can, and even more.",
