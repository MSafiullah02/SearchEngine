Given the coexistence of a world-wide epidemic of obesity, which in some Western countries affects up to a 40% of the general population [1], it is prudent to consider the impact that COVID-19 infection can have on people living with obesity. Notably, elevated body mass index (BMI) and obesity were predictors of poor outcomes and fatalities due to H1N1 [2]. Moreover, observations from Wuhan show that hypertension (30%), diabetes (22%), and coronary artery disease (22%), all of which are more common in people living with obesity, were the most common comorbidities in patients requiring hospitalisation [3, 4]. Poorly, in the Chinese studies obesity rates were not reported.",

Patients with obesity have a higher activity of nuclear transcription factor kappa B and a higher ribonucleic acid expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), crucial elements in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome [5]. The innate immune response in patients with obesity is altered and leads to an altered first line of defense, increased inflammatory response, and abnormal T-cell response [6]. Furthermore, the key role of IL-6 in mediating the acute phase response and its value as a prognostic biomarker in sepsis and various acute organ injuries has been extensively investigated in clinical and experimental studies [7]. The pro-inflammatory role of IL-6 is often described in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, especially in asthma [8] and in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [7]. Plasma and/or broncho-alveolar levels of IL-6 have been identified as early biomarkers of lung injury [7]. IL-6 acts on hepatocytes to induce expression of CRP as a part of the acute phase response and may also play a central role for the development and progression of liver disease [9].",

Different risk factors include sex and smoking [10], hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and the treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-increasing drugs [11]. The potential risk factors for poor prognosis in early stage include older age, high sequential organ failure assessment score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/l [3]. Low-grade systemic inflammation, as is common in people living with obesity, is associated with the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and asthma [8], well known comorbidities that adversely affect the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 [12\u201315]. The role of the liver, as a key organ that performs immune response against pathogens and the high incidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in patients with obesity and chronic inflammation, has still to be cleared in patients affected by COVID-19.",
