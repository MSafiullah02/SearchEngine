Some scholars proposed establishing traffic control, using a triage process for patients, and creating checkpoints for hand washing. 5 Successful control of the SARS epidemic relied on the integration of several measures, including triage of patients with fever of unknown etiology, mandatory body temperature surveillance, and installation of a fever screening outpatient department. 6 Infection control measures including hand washing, wearing masks, gloves, wearing protective clothing and shoe covers, and so on, were also recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States during the SARS outbreak. 7 These infection control measures were further refined and improved during the Ebola outbreak. 8 Similarly, the Ministry of Health of China formulated a prescreening and triage system after the SARS epidemic. 9 Triage is an infection control measure in China. A detailed contact history and occupational history of the patients during the hospital admission process are collected by physicians working in various departments of the medical institutions. Combined with the main complaint, medical history, symptoms, and signs of the patients, prescreening for infectious diseases, those who have been prescreened as patients with infectious diseases or suspected to have infectious diseases should go through the triage process at the Department of Infectious Diseases or another triage point. In addition, necessary disinfection measures should be implemented at the clinics.",

Therefore, in nonepidemic areas, the prescreening and triage process should focus on screening infectious sources to prevent the spread of infection in the local area. Therefore, we take the migration and contact history of patients as the key point of screening.
