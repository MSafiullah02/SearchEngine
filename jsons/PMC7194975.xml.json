Moreover, they also poor personal care as well as protective measure resulting in having the infection.2Spread the infection: as they roam most of the time to and from, they can be a potential spreader of the highly infectious viruses like COVID-19.3Difficult to identify and quarantine: If a homeless mentally ill person acquires COVID-19 infection, it is unlikely to catch public attention. As the identity (name, address) of these persons are mostly not known and they keep on roaming in the streets, roadside and may disappear, they are not easily traceable. Moreover, the LMICs usually lack of such specialized set up, attention and promise to isolate this group of people.\n",

This may result in non-adoption of personal protective measures to prevent acquiring the COVID-19 infection.5Poor help-seeking behaviour: Help-seeking behaviour for health conditions are poor among patients with mental illness (Gururaj et al., 2016) and it is likely to becomes further worse if the mentally ill person is homeless.6Increased Case Fatality Rate (CFR): Even without COVID-19 co-infection, the psychiatric patients suffered from premature death. In the countries with most accessible mental health healthcare system such as Australia and the Scandinavian, the mortality gaps accounted to 15\u201320 years compared to the normal population (Thornicroft, 2013). The comorbidity between mental disorder and COVID-19 among MHIP leads to tremendous challenge in LMICs.\n",

The government and other responsible stakeholders should take a lead to screen the health condition of these homeless mentally ill persons in the LMICs, which may be beneficial in reducing the community spread of COVID-19 infection. At the same time there is potential role of mental health professionals to address the mental health issues of these patients as they are often untreated (Banerjee, 2020). As there is paucity of manpower in mental healthcare in developing countries, the mental health issues of homeless mentally ill can be addressed through online consultation liaising with general medical practitioners (Yao et al., 2020). Early and adequate treatment of mental illnesses in these patients is likely to improve their general physical health and degree of adherence to the precautionary measures required during this COVID-19 pandemic.",
