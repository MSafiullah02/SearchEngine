This forum developed a Strategic Framework for Reducing Risks of Infectious Diseases at the Animal-Human-Ecosystems Interface (http://un-influenza.org/files/OWOH_14Oct08.pdf). The resulting strategy document described the necessity of building upon HPAI H5N1 preparedness to include all emerging infectious diseases, and focused on diseases at the animal, human, and ecosystem interface. This strategic framework was presented at the Sharm-El-Sheikh meeting and a One Health approach was formally endorsed in the meeting summary (http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D5894.PDF).",

Specific recommendations from this meeting included: fostering political will; supporting partnerships and collaboration; encouraging data sharing and integration; building capacity; developing communication strategies and plans; providing incentives for reporting adverse events; encouraging stakeholder and community engagement; and developing supra-country approaches (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/2009/er-rc/pdf/er-rc-eng.pdf).

Then, in April 2010, the third IMCAPI meeting was held in Hanoi (http://un-influenza.org/node/4040). The declaration that emerged from this IMCAPI called for a global recognition of the need to \u201cbetter understand the emergence of disease threats at the animal-human-environment interface through multi-sector actions, and to develop appropriate and sustainable means to reduce such threats\u201d.

Of critical importance, the proposed meeting was anchored to the following overview premise:The concept of \u201cOne Health\u201d is broad and flexible, as it is intended to encompass the many facets of the relationships among human, animals, and the ecosystems in which they co-exist and interact. In this way, varying detailed interpretations of the scopes of this concept may be put forth according to specific need.The discussion at this meeting will focus on defining the actions and policies needed to implement a \u201cOne Health\u201d approach. In the context of this meeting, \u201cOne Health\u201d represents the inter-sectoral collaborative approach necessary to prevent, detect and control emerging, and re-emerging infectious diseases that exist at the animal-human-ecosystems interface.

In addition, the dates identified by the planning committee coincided with a limited number of rooms being available. This detail restricted the number of participants to a maximum of 54, thereby overcoming the impediment of inflated participation that was identified during review of the Winnipeg meeting. The attendee list was defined by category of subject matter expertise (i.e., human health, wildlife, domestic animal, economist, and plant health) and geographical representation, but not organizational representation. Definition of invitees by category deliberately conveyed that no single individual was essential to the success of the meeting; the key to moving forward was the balance in areas of expertise created by the attendees. Each organization represented on the core planning committee was assigned a number of attendee slots that it could fill. However, before any invitation was extended, the credentials of that candidate were reviewed, debated, and approved by the entire committee. No invitee was allowed to self-select a replacement. A selection criteria grid mandated that animal, human, and ecosystem health were equitably represented. It is of note that no one on the planning committee knew everyone on the invitee list, and thus it was not simply the same group of people getting together (Fig. 1).\n\n",

However, it was also recognized that the exclusion of accomplished scientists with much to contribute may have inadvertently led to the perception that the SMM process was exclusionary and not representative of the larger One Health community of interest. To foster transparency and garner involvement from a wider array of subject matter experts, the planning committee and the Work Group chairs took every opportunity to present information about the SMM in both formal and informal venues. At the same time, Work Group chairs and Work Group members reached out to colleagues and invited them to join Work Groups, even though they had not attended the seminal SMM. This led to many additional members being added to all of the Work Groups; the Training Work Group expanded from 21 to 52 members.",

At the same time, the University of Minnesota has received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to look at One Health competencies and curriculum development.

Indeed, during the past century there has been an explosion of scientific knowledge that has fostered a separation of human and animal health sectors (Starr 1982). Needless to say, many collaborative relationships persisted but for the most part collaboration was accomplished on a topic-specific basis. The current global movement of people, animals, products, and pathogens demands a holistic approach to surveillance and response to disease emergence and changing ecosystems that is much more than a return to an earlier version of One Health (Cutler 2010; Lloyd-Smith 2009; Feingold 2010).\n",

He said that a paradigm shift occurs when scientists encounter anomalies which cannot be handled using the prevailing paradigm. He went on to say if there were enough significant anomalies then a crisis would ensue and a new paradigm would need to be generated. The prevailing paradigm for disease control and prevention has not facilitated or promoted coordination among animal, human, and ecosystem sectors. This paradigm was repeatedly tested when the global community was presented with \u2018anomalies\u2019 such as HIV, SARS, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1. Response to these challenges would have been optimized if there had been coordinated surveillance, response and intervention among human, animal, and environmental health sectors. This lack of overall coordination may have constituted Kuhn\u2019s definition of a crisis, and thus provided the basis for consideration of a twenty-first century One Health paradigm. According to Kuhn, the new paradigm is not just a gradual refinement of the old. Rather, it requires deliberate changes in the way scientists approach problems such as emerging pathogens.",
