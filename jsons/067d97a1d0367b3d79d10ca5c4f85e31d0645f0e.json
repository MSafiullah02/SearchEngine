Therefore, we included Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment as a control group. In our study, efficacy was evaluated by (i) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for measuring COVID-19 viral RNAs, (ii) lung computerized tomography (CT) for assessing the improvement of NCP, and (iii) length of hospitalization for assessing patient recovery. Safety was evaluated by adverse event monitoring. Here, we report our initial results on Chloroquine therapy of COVID-19 patients.",

The first patient achieving lung clearance based on CT imaging was from the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group at Day 6 and this patient became SARS-CoV-2 negative at Day 3. In the Chloroquine group, the first patient achieving lung clearance was recognized at Day 8, who became SARS-CoV-2 negative at Day 7 ( Figure 1B , middle panel).

By Day 14, the incidence rate of lung improvement based on CT imaging from the Chloroquine group was more than doubled to that of the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (rate ratio 2.21, 95% CI 0.81-6.62). These results suggest that patients treated with Chloroquine appear to recover better and regain their pulmonary function quicker than those treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. In addition, consistent with the CT imaging data ( Figure 1B , middle panel), patients treated with Chloroquine were discharged from hospital in a much quicker pace ( Figure 1B, right panel) . The first patient discharged from hospital was from the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group at Day 8, and the first discharged from the Chloroquine group was at Day 9. Encouragingly, by Day 14, all 10 patients (100%) from the Chloroquine group were discharged compared to 6 patients (50%) from the Lopinavir/ Ritonavir group ( Figure 1B , right panel; Supplementary Table S2) . Furthermore, Chloroquine also appeared to promote quicker recovery compared to Lopinavir/ Ritonavir recommended by health authorities in China.",

The most common adverse event was vomiting observed in 4 patients. All observed adverse events were known to be related to Chloroquine. There were no serious adverse events or patient withdrew from Chloroquine during the treatment period. Among the 5 patients with adverse events, 3 of them had valid measurements of serum concentration of Chloroquine at 14 days after treatment completion. The serum concentration of Chloroquine decreased to the range of 0.26-0.61 \u00b5mol/L, which was safe to patients. Overall, Chloroquine appears well tolerated among the patients we treated. Adverse reactions can be avoided by strengthening patient monitoring and strictly following the standard oral dosage of the drug. To further investigate the change of immunity through the therapy, we measured T-cell counts of the 10 patients in the Chloroquine group every 2 days. The trajectories of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ counts showed that there was no significant decrease of T-cell counts during the 10-day treatment period ( Figure 1C) , indicating that the shortterm use of Chloroquine had no significant effect on immune function of patients.",
