The current study found a higher percentage of dogs had a protective level of anti-rabies antibodies than that reported in a study by Singh et al.

The influencing factors associated with antibody titers level and their P-value are presented in Table 2 . Of the 110 dogs, 48 dogs had been vaccinated with vaccine A, 31 with vaccine B, and 31 with vaccine C.

Poor response of vaccine B (17% failure rate) may be due to the age of the vaccinated pet dogs (as 3/ 31 dogs were below the age of two years and 2/31 dogs were above seven years). Also the formulation and concentration of vaccine B was different in comparison to the other two ",

However, there was no difference in antibody titer level or vaccine performance with two or more vaccines given at the same time (antirabies and corona, anti-rabies and canine distemper combined vaccine DHPPiL or anti-rabies, corona and canine distemper combined vaccine DHPPiL together). As yet, no studies on variation in canine parvovirus, has been published from Nepal. Mansfield et al. [22] and Jakel et al.

Vaccine failure was observed in twelve dogs in this study. Ten of those dogs had an insufficient titer level, while two dogs had an undetectable titer level. Those results could be due to influencing factors like age, breeds, type of vaccines, poor administration, out of date and poor storage etc. Vaccines produced by different manufacturers have significantly different failure rates, and significantly different median titers of response. This is presumably due to their formulation and the production differences between vaccines together with the concentration and integrity of antigen content and the adjuvant used [21] .",

Dogs which stayed outdoors were comparatively less well cared for than the dogs which stayed inside and had frequent contact with their owners. Due to some health conditions, prior to the vaccination or after the vaccination, the immune system in some dogs might have been compromised which led to a delayed immune response. Among the five classes of immunoglobulins, IgG has the predominant role in protecting against infections.
