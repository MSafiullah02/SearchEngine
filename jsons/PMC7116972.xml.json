The annual economic growth rate was among the highest of all countries during the 1990s; GDP per capita has been increasing dramatically. China's economy has taken rapid steps to open up its doors to investment from foreign countries and competition. In addition, the economic structure has undergone dramatic changes. State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) reformed from government-protected units to profit-maximizing enterprises. Deregulation has allowed collective enterprises (enterprises owned by local government: province, city, county, etc) to become either contract responsibility system1\nor individual firms. Meanwhile, there was a big boom in private, foreign-funded and other source-funded enterprises.",

However, relatively few studies emphasized that dramatic reform also affected employment and associated welfare benefits. Chen (2005) has noticed unemployment and social security sustainability problem after reforms. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping directed the Chinese economy to build \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d. This direction essentially allowed all enterprises to participate in a market economy while still keeping the ownership of the state. However, there was no clear statement as of how this goal would affect the welfare provision in China. As state firms faced fierce competition and financial troubles, were they still able to continue providing welfare benefits? Moreover, the urban and rural gap in the economic conditions has become larger. The report in the New York Times (Jan 14th, 2000) noted that \u201cthe collapse of socialized medicine and staggering cost increases [opened] a yawning gap between health care in the cities and the rural areas\u201d, which had the consequences that \u201cabsence of adequate health care\u2026spread infectious diseases like hepatitis and tuberculosis and making the country \u2013 and the world \u2013 more vulnerable to epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and possibly bird flu.\u201d",

Beginning in 1979, coastal cities began to attract more investment from foreign countries. From 1979 to the mid-1980s, there were only limited openings of Special Economic Zones in Fujian and Guangdong province. From 1985 to the early 1990s, The Open Door Policy was enforced in most of the coastal cities, and Coastal Economic Zones came into being. From 1992 to 2000, the level of opening up increased and expanded to major parts of China (though some rural areas were excluded). During the 1990s, FDI actually used increased from 44 to 407 billion US dollars, about 10 fold (MOFTEC (2001)). For total industrial output, foreign-funded firms' share increased from 5% in 1991 to 23% in 2000. Facing severe competition, shutting down of inefficient SOEs had accelerated. Workers who lost their job would also lose their health insurance.",

Beginning in 1992, the modern enterprises system was established and all the decision-making, implementation and supervising power were controlled by SOEs themselves. Since SOEs were able to make decisions on new recruits, many workers in the SOEs were laid off, and others switched to private companies. In both cases individuals would lose insurance.",

More and more TVEs and non-state enterprises were reformed into individual-owned or private-owned firms if they were small. Since in China non-state-owned enterprises were not required to provide health insurance, workers who remained in the reformed collective enterprises were likely to lose health insurance. In addition, in the middle and later 1990s, the rural collective enterprises had slower growth which further troubled the insurance coverage.5\n",

I categorize the sample by subgroups that include work unit group, urban/rural group, age group, education group, health status group and income group. Table 1\nsummarizes the insurance coverage for these subgroups over time. Working unit group is divided into SOEs, collective enterprises, other private enterprises, unemployed, retired, housewife, student and others not working. Collective enterprises include small collective enterprises (such as township owned enterprises and TVEs) and large collectives (such as those owned by county, city, or province). Other private includes family contract, individual, mixed-sources investment enterprises, household business. Rural and urban groups are divided according to the legal residence status. 6\nHousehold income is divided into three groups: poor, middle and rich.7\nThere are several noted trends.(1)Overall, health insurance coverage decreased from 33% of individuals in 1991 to 23% of individuals in 2000.(2)By work units, in 1991, SOE had a leading health insurance coverage rate of 86% while collective enterprises had a slightly lower coverage rate of 61%. In contrast, other private had only 6% coverage rates and unemployed had 8% coverage. This may be because some of the unemployed workers still had their registered work units status (a status called xiagang), so they still maintained welfare relationships with their work unit. SOE and collectives experienced great loss of insurance overt time whereas other private and unemployed had relatively constant coverage (with a slight increase in 1997 and a slight drop in 2000) (See Fig. 2\nas well). Retirees also had a slightly higher insurance coverage (around 12%) than the non-SOE and the non-collective employees, as retirees from the SOEs or the collective enterprises could still keep their insurance. Housewife's insurance status depended on whether any household member worked in a SOE or a collective enterprise. Most college students were insured through the school medical insurance as most universities were state-owned. To summarize, SOEs and collective enterprises decreased provision of health insurance to their workers greatly, whereas other private had slightly increased insurance coverage (6% in 1991 and 7% in 2000) and unemployed remained relatively constant (around 8%).(3)Urban residents (65%) had much higher insurance coverage than rural residents (11%) did at the beginning of 1990s. However, dramatic decreases in insurance coverage occurred in urban areas (from 65% to 44%), whereas rural areas had only small decline (from 11% to 8%). Migration from rural areas to urban areas may cause loss of health insurance as they were not officially registered in the cities.8\n(4)Predictably, the poor group had the lowest insurance rate (11% in 1991), whereas the rich group had the highest insurance rate (49% in 1991). However, over time insurance coverage decreased more for the rich group, so that the difference between the rich and poor narrowed. The associated phenomenon was also noticed in the literature.\n",

In that case the province dummies are absorbed by the individual fixed effects.

Those who had the choice of private insurance tend to choose to be insured by both public and private insurance. This is why temporary health status is treated as exogenous in the regression as not many Chinese people are able to purchase or choose private insurance by themselves. The time invariant fixed effect term \u03b1i represents individual unobserved factors. Openjt is the indicator of the degree of openness. Collectivejt is the indicator of the number of collective enterprises in each province. The parameters of interest are \u03c6 and \u03c0 since they measure the reform effects and we call them \u201cheterogeneous treatment effects\u201d. Zit are individual-level control variables which include work unit type (SOE, Collective, Others, Unemployed) and registration status (urban or rural). Since we are also interested in how the gaps between different types of workers change over time, interaction terms between Zit and Openjt are included in the regression as well. Xit are other individual-level control variables and include age, education, gender, health status, marital status, household income and the number of bread-earners in the household.

The reason for more insured in the selected sample is that in order to be selected the person had to have had insurance in at least one year. This will inevitably lead to higher insurance rates when the original insurance rate was only 29%. In addition, more SOE employees (30% vs. 19%), more collective enterprises employees (24% vs. 13%), and more urban residents (59% compared to 41%) are included in the selected sample.",

Here I adjusted their index by a one-year lag since the Open Door Policy usually took place in a few pilot cities, before spreading to the entire province. I also constructed the reform variables for the year 2000 following the methodology of Woo et al. (2002). The Open Door Policy variables differentiate across provinces and years, which can be used to identify the effects of economic reforms. \u201cOpen degree 1\u201d is a binary variable indicating whether or not the Open Door Policy was in place in a certain province. \u201cOpen degree 2\u201d is a binary variable indicating whether or not the policy had been developed to a certain level in a certain province and it indicates how much the province had been affected by the policy. The collective index is constructed from the proportion of collective employees in each province and is also composed of two indicator variables (see Table 3\n). The smaller is the proportion of the collective employees, the larger is the index.",

The Open Door Policy was associated with two counter effects: decrease in SOE insurance and increase in provision of private insurance. However, the positive effect was dominated by the negative effect since private insurance was not widely purchased in China during the 1990s. The reforms in collective enterprises (refer to coefficient of \u201cCollective 2\u201d) is associated with 8% points decrease in health insurance. The transition to contract system and individual-owned firms, and the slower growth of collective enterprises especially rural collective enterprises were the key factors affecting the provision of public health insurance. The falling of rural collective enterprises was largely due to overall economic downturn, financial intermediation inadequacy and migration of skilled labors.",

The gap decreased further when the economy became more opened up (see the interaction terms with \u201cOpen Degree 2\u201d).

Especially women in rural areas tended not to work due to low education and cultural reasons, whereas in cities women and men were more equally educated and women often worked. Women with high level of education in rural areas tended to move to cities whereas women with low level of education often got married and stayed in the original place where they were born. Therefore, being married is very important for women in rural areas to be covered with health insurance.",

In particular, individuals in urban areas that were highly affected by the Open Door Policy experienced 17 percentage points reduction in health insurance coverage. The reform and the consequent unemployment of collective enterprises were associated with 8 percentage points decrease in health insurance coverage.",

This could be due to the large decline in the provision of welfare benefits in SOE and collective enterprises. Moreover, policy effects were found to be stronger in urban areas than in rural areas. The effects of socioeconomic characteristics were asymmetric across urban and rural areas. For example, household income and education were important factors in urban areas, whereas being married is the most significant factor in rural areas.",

As more and more Chinese state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises faced market competition, they had no choice but to lay off workers and consequently reduce welfare benefits. As part of the \u201cChinese characteristics\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d, these companies continued to provide benefits to temporarily laid-off workers and retirees as a partial support to workers and their families. However, the continuing decline of health insurance coverage and its association to the Open Door Policy served as strong evidence that only those SOEs that can survive market competition are more likely to continue their provision of welfare benefits.",
