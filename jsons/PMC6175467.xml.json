            "text": "Classical and novel human astroviruses (HAstV) are nonenveloped, single\u2010stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Astroviridae family. Classical HAstV (serotypes 1\u20108) are phylogenetically distant from novel HAstV (namely MLB and VA) with amino acid identities being as low as 23% to a maximum of 54.5% depending on the open reading frames.1 Although classical HAstV are a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis, especially in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients,2, 3, 4 the clinical manifestations of novel HAstV have not been fully characterized.5, 6, 7, 8 The spectrum of human diseases for classical and novel HAstV is not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract: both have been reported as causal agents of central nervous system infections.1 A seroepidemiological study of the novel HAstV MLB1 in the United States suggests that primary infection occurs in childhood, with seropositivity reaching 70%, 90%, and 100% by ages 3, 4\u20106, and 7\u201017 years, respectively.9 A recent survey of classical and novel HAstV in clinical stool samples collected in a tertiary care hospital indicates that, for both viral groups, susceptible populations are young children (\u22644 years) and the immunocompromised patients.10 Yet, for patients with novel HAstV, stool viral loads are lower and upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms (cough, rhinorrhea, and odynophagia) are more frequent (70%), suggesting a potentially different pathogenic pathway between novel and classical HAstV. Indeed, additional reports of novel HAstV (MLB1, MLB2, and VA1) in pediatric nasopharyngeal specimens continue to emerge.11, 12, 13\n",

This 13\u2010month\u2010old female patient with a past medical history of congenital heart disease and severe failure to thrive was hospitalized electively for surgical repair of a ventricular septal defect on November 2016. At admission (day 0), the child presented with nasal discharge, fever (temperature of 38.4\u00b0C), and tachypnea (respiratory rate 44/minute) but normal oxygen saturation (97%). Laboratory workup revealed a normal white blood cell count and C\u2010reactive protein levels. Respiratory virus screening performed on an NPS sample revealed the presence of picornavirus (Ct = 23). A later analysis of the same sample revealed evidence of a novel HAstV\u2010MLB2 with a viral load of 10 400 RNA copies/mL of viral transport medium, as did the analysis of a serum sample collected on the same day (viral load to 2660 RNA copies/mL). A viral URT infection was diagnosed, and surgery was postponed. Of note, the retrospective review of the medical record provides no information on the presence of URT symptoms before admission. Subject #1 had no signs of gastrointestinal infection either before admission or on the day of sampling (day 0). Respiratory manifestations improved but persisted. On day 7, she presented with nonbloody diarrhea; stool samples were positive for enterovirus (Ct = 29) and novel HAstV\u2010MLB2 (5710 RNA copies/PCR reaction). Another NPS sample tested positive for RSV (Ct = 34). Because of continued gastrointestinal symptoms, an additional stool sample was collected on day 16; it revealed the continued presence of both enterovirus (Ct = 25) and novel HAstV\u2010MLB2 (421 RNA copies/PCR reaction). On day 20, a nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen tested positive for adenovirus (Ct = 33) and picornavirus (Ct = 19). Finally, a diagnosis of viral URT infection and acute viral gastroenteritis was made. The patient did not receive any antimicrobials and slowly improved, undergoing surgery on day 26. Although the patient remained asymptomatic, a postoperative bronchial aspirate sample was collected, given the earlier viral infections, and it revealed the presence of human bocavirus (Ct = 29), RSV (Ct = 37), and picornavirus (Ct = 34). The retrospective analysis for HAstV\u2010MLB2 was negative.",

The retrospective review of the medical record provides no information on the presence of URT symptoms before admission. Subject #2 had no signs of gastrointestinal infection before admission.

Skin examination revealed good wound healing without signs of infection. A chest X\u2010ray revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory workup showed normal C\u2010reactive protein and white blood cell count (9.3 G/L) with elevated bands (17%) and a mild lymphocytopenia (0.74 G/L). On day 6, the patient remained febrile (38.1\u00b0C) without diarrhea or other signs of focal infection apart from persistent coryza.

This prevalence is likely an underestimation considering the relatively low number of URT samples collected at University Hospitals of Geneva in the summer season and the mild respiratory manifestations (cough and rhinorrhea, as previously reported10) for which children are often managed as outpatients and for which further diagnostic testing is rarely performed. Furthermore, a large number of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza A/B and RSV were conducted directly in the pediatric emergency room during the cold season, thereby limiting the number of URT samples sent to the routine laboratory for PCR screening. One hundred forty\u2010six of the 205 NPS samples (71.2%) were collected in the context of URT symptoms, while 55 (26.8%) were collected and screened for respiratory viruses in patients without URT manifestations but according to specific clinical situations (eg, fever of unknown origin, workup, follow\u2010up of transplanted recipients). For four NPS samples, the retrospective review of the medical records did not reveal any information about URT symptoms on the day of sampling.",

The limitations of this pilot study to clarify the clinical relevance of novel HAstV in URT infections are: q(a) to extend the investigations to all susceptible populations, that is, pediatric and immunocompromised patients (b) although children \u22644 years represents the pediatric\u2010susceptible population, it would be relevant to perform a comparative analysis between the different pediatric age groups (ie, neonates, infants, children, and adolescent) (c) there is a need for prospective case\u2010control studies considering not only the novel HAstV susceptible populations but also the entire pediatric and adult populations with matching respective control groups.

To date, most studies have reported disseminated infection only among immunocompromised patients.1 Subject #1 did not have a history, signs, or symptoms suggestive of immune deficiency. However, a certain degree of immunodeficiency cannot be ruled out because some heart diseases are associated with immune deficits in various syndrome.15 In particular, the underdiagnosed deletion 22q11, which may cause cardiac malformation and congenital immunodeficiency, was not investigated in this patient.16\n",
