These animals differ vastly in habitat, body size, feeding habits (omnivore to specialized herbivore), dietary requirements, behavior, anatomy, and physiology. The past decade has seen an exponential increase in the number of certain rodent species, such as rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, prairie dogs, and squirrels, being owned as pets. Rodent owners are increasingly expecting the same high-quality veterinary care to be afforded to their valued companion as is provided to dogs and cats. The approach to oral disorders in these animals can be in part extrapolated from other more common rodent species such as guinea pigs, and from rabbits; however, specific information regarding their natural feeding habits along with a knowledge of their dental and oral anatomy and physiology is essential. Appropriate diagnostic testing and imaging techniques are also necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis, formulate a prognosis, and develop a treatment plan. In particular, pseudo-odontomas of prairie dogs require an intimate understanding of their anatomy, as they pose a unique challenge regarding anesthetic protocols and surgical treatment.",

The enamel is characteristically pigmented yellow-orange in most rodents. In cavy-like rodents, all teeth are elodont. Also, premolar and molar teeth are anatomically similar in this group, and are commonly named \u201ccheek teeth\u201d.1, 3 A remarkable difference between rat-like and squirrel-like rodent species is that the first group lacks premolar teeth. This is not clinically relevant, but results in diverse dental formulas (Figs. 1 and 2\n). Different from hystrichomorphs, squirrel-like and rat-like rodents have anelodont premolar and/or molar teeth. They are truly rooted (with a limited growth period), single or multiple rooted, and are not worn during normal chewing activity. They are brachyodont (short crowned) with multiple cusps. Depending on species, premolars and molars have more or less different size and shape in the same quadrant. The premolar and molar teeth of prairie dogs and other herbivorous ground squirrels have multiple roots. Molar teeth of myomorphs also have multiple roots. The crown has cusps and ridges that create a rough occlusal surface.7 Regardless of these differences, the premolar and/or molar cheek teeth of myomorph and sciuromorph rodents are commonly named \u201ccheek teeth\u201d as well.",

In the sciuromorphs, the deep masseter expands forward onto the rostrum and it separates into 2 parts (anterior and posterior). In myomorphs, the origins of both parts of the masseter muscle have migrated forward onto the rostrum and work together to move the mandible forward and backward and are therefore equally adapted for both feeding modes (gnawing by the incisors and chewing by the molars).10, 11 In myomorphs, the mandible has a wide range of rostrocaudal movement and can even be subluxated rostrally during gnawing.1, 3 The cheek teeth are in occlusion when the jaw is at rest, giving the mandible a brachygnathic appearance.1, 3 Ultimately, when the incisors are gnawing and the cutting edges of mandibular and maxillary incisors are approximated, the molars are pulled out of occlusion. When chewing of food occurs, it is then that the mandibular incisors move posteriorly to the maxillary ones and the molars occlude again. During crushing of food, upward and forward movements of the mandible become evident.13\n",

Conversely, the reduced deep masseter of the guinea pig may indicate this species mostly eats by chewing with the cheek teeth while spending less time gnawing with the incisors compared with squirrels or rats.15 Actually, rats and squirrels consume more hard food (eg, nuts and seeds) than guinea pigs, which feed primarily on vegetation. Myomorphs are the most versatile, as they merge anatomic features of sciuromorphs and hystricomorphs and are equally efficient at both gnawing and chewing. These 2 feeding modes are mutually exclusive because incisors and molars cannot be in occlusion at the same time due to the mismatch between maxillary and mandibular length. Hence propalineal action is necessary to accomplish these tasks.16, 17\n",

The most common form of acquired malocclusion seen in myomorphs is overgrowth (abnormal coronal elongation of clinical crowns), often accompanied by lateral mandibular shifting (Figs. 4 and 5\n). Because of the flexible symphysis and related movement of each mandible, malocclusion may create abnormal forces capable of slight rotation of the mandibles over the long axis. This allows the mandibular incisors to bypass the maxillary incisors laterally, while the maxillary clinical crowns follow the curvature of the reserve crowns into the oral cavity. In those species with high mechanical pressure at the apical sites of the upper incisors, palatal perforation can occur.19 Malpositioning after a jaw fracture and age-related loss of clinical crowns in gerbils have also been reported as frequent causes of incisor malocclusion in myomorphs.18 Abscess formation and osteoresorptive lesions may be seen involving the incisors in these rodent species.13\n",

However, dental problems due to excessive wearing and severe caries can still occur in these rodents, deeply reducing the crown and resulting in teeth loss3, 7 (Fig. 6\n). Captive myomorphs and sciuromorphs can develop periodontal disease, dental caries, and tooth decay if fed an inappropriate, high-sugar diet.13, 20 Gerbils have been reported to develop spontaneous periodontal disease if fed a standard rat or mouse diet for more than 6 months.21 These rodents should therefore be fed an appropriate pelleted diet targeted to their specific requirements. Periodontal inflammation stimulates odontoclastic resorption, which creates cavities in the affected tooth. In some cases, repair takes place with granulation tissue moving in, as an attempt to contain the damage but lost dentin is not replaced. Caries lesions in rodents with brachyodont cheek teeth are similar to those seen in humans. Rats, in particular, have been used as animal models for human caries.22 Hamsters are especially prone to develop periodontal disease, dental caries, and facial abscesses caused by a tooth root abscess.3, 23\n",

In the latter case, the clinical crown may either appear mobile but still attached to the gingiva, or missing. Both lesions are frequently overlooked by owners. In prairie dogs, respiratory signs and symptoms are most common, and are frequently associated with reduced activity, reduced food intake, weight loss, and emaciation.3, 7 Respiratory symptoms may include sneezing, a particular type of snoring (often referred to as \u201creverse sneezing\u201d), pronounced inspiratory effort, or true dyspnea. They are secondary to the dysplastic changes and apical deformities of diseased maxillary incisors. Because prairie dogs are obligate nasal breathers, these changes may result in reduced nasal air passage to obstruction. A firm swelling of the hard palate caused by the deformed apices may be visible on intraoral inspection of the anesthetized patient3, 7; however, the size of the lesion above the hard palate does not seem to correlate with the degree of respiratory distress.23, 31 Aging patients, usually older than 5 years, also may be presented for reduced food intake, reduced fecal output, and emaciation in the absence of respiratory signs. Underlying medical issues should be ruled out in these cases, but end-stage dental disease with excessive wearing, caries, and fractures causing flattening of cheek teeth crowns, is usually the primary cause of these presenting signs.3, 5, 7\n",

Therefore, a systematic approach is required. Thorough history, including dietary details, feeding habits, and husbandry with regard to cage construction and design, is of utmost importance. However, the absence of a clear history does not rule out underlying dental problems. In selected rodent species or in calm and adequately restrained individuals, a partial physical and dental examination may be possible without anesthesia. Inspection of incisors may be possible in some prairie dogs. The incisor teeth should be examined from the labial and lateral aspect. Evaluation of the facial symmetry and palpation (including the ventral mandibular borders, and the zygomatic and temporomandibular joint areas) may allow identification of irregularities and swellings. When feasible in the awake patient, lateral and horizontal jaw movement should be assessed. Any discomfort or pain should be noted.13 Gentle expression of the cheek pouches is necessary to remove stored food, which may hinder examination. They should be examined fully and not mistaken for a pathologic swelling secondary to impaction, prolapse, or neoplasia. An otoscope with appropriately sized plastic cone, or alternatively nasal or vaginal speculum may be used to examine the oral cavity in rodents. The use of a pediatric laryngoscope for examination of the oral cavity of manually restrained small mammals, including prairie dogs, is reported.61 Eyes, periocular structures, and cheek teeth should be examined as well. Despite the large mouth opening, the oral cavity is small, and the cheek teeth are positioned caudally to the long diastema. Therefore, a complete oral examination may be effectively and safely performed only with the patient under general anesthesia.3\n",

Dental abrasions, fractures, and caries may have fewer symptoms and may be more readily identified on stomatoscopic examination (see Fig. 6). A 1.9-mm or 2.7-mm rigid telescope with a 30\u00b0 viewing angle are generally used for these procedures, because the 30\u00b0 angle provides a better view of the occlusal surfaces. Each tooth should be examined individually with the use of a periodontal probe. The gingival sulcus should be probed circumferentially to identify the presence of pockets and their depth; purulent discharge; food or hair impaction; and evidence of decay, caries, and any other abnormality.13 The telescope also can be used periodically to evaluate the intraoperative progress of premolar or molar extractions or to examine the cavity left following extraction.63\n",

This may be particularly challenging in very small species, such as myomorphs smaller than rats. Multiple views are necessary for full assessment.65 At least 4 standard views (latero-lateral, 2 obliques, ventrodorsal, or dorsoventral) are recommended.3, 66 Intraoral views may be useful in larger species, such as the prairie dog, to visualize cheek teeth root tips and the apical incisor area.3 Among the many dental abnormalities, it is important to discuss those affecting the incisor teeth in case of pseudo-odontomas of prairie dogs and elodontomas of other squirrels. In case of dysplastic changes, the apex of maxillary incisor teeth appears enlarged. Both the apex and most of the reserve crown have a dorsal irregular margin, displaying newly formed folds of dentine.3, 5, 6, 35, 66 These radiographic findings are best evaluated at lateral or slightly oblique views. Thirty-degree oblique, ventrodorsal, and rostrocaudal views help to assess if the pseudo-odontoma is unilateral or bilateral, and the stage of severity (Fig. 12\n). Detailed diagnosis is critical for prognosis and the treatment plan. The reserve and/or clinical crown is usually shorter than normal, and the occlusal plane is abnormal as well. Pseudo-odontomas affecting the mandibular incisors show similar radiographic findings, although usually less evident. Similar to radiographic findings in cavy-like rodents affected by elodontoma, such as the degu,39 radiography of squirrels shows a large radiopaque mass with increased mineral opacity well beyond the apex and the reserve crown, locally invasive and destructive.28\n",

CT overcomes superimposition on a single plane of adjacent and overlying anatomic structures, and 3-dimensional renderings provide excellent details (even in small mammal species) of bone structures in particular. Superior details and dynamic views allow detection of early changes in tooth structure, evaluation of the involvement of surrounding soft tissue, or extension of osteomyelitic foci. CT therefore enhances the level of diagnostic accuracy, providing more accurate and detailed information than traditional radiographic images. These are critical for accurate prognosis, more tailored surgical planning, and successful treatment.67 In prairie dogs affected by pseudo-odontomas, CT is particularly useful to assess the extension of the hard mass, the degree of compression of the nasal cavity, the involvement of surrounding tissues, and the most appropriate surgical approach37 (Fig. 13\n). CT is also particularly useful for assessment of the temporomandibular joint.",

Extraction is also an indication for treatment of pseudo-odontomas in prairie dogs. Extraction of incisors does not seem to affect the feeding behavior in captive pets,6 as they can manipulate food with their forearms. However, diet modification by eliminating hard food items should be considered. The procedure can be performed with careful dissection of the periodontal ligament with the same technique described in rabbits by using small dental luxators6 or appropriately contoured hypodermic needles3, 7 (Fig. 15\n). However, this is more intricate and difficult due to the small size of the patient, the dental anatomy of these species (mandibular incisors extend within the mandible below the cheek teeth and the apex is located distal to the last molar in hamsters, rats, and squirrels), and possible complications (namely, fracture of the maxillary incisors, fracture of the mandible, and diastasis of the mobile mandibular synchondrosis/symphysis).7 Radiographs before extraction are recommended to evaluate tooth morphology, curvature, and fracture type, as well as for assessing presence and extension of injuries to the surrounding soft tissues.13 Post-extraction control radiographs are also important to verify complete extraction. Jekl13 recommends coronal reduction of the incisors followed by extraction 5 to 7 days later, in cases of failure of correction and excessive regrowth. Regrowth and eruption of a new tooth is a possible complication; therefore, it is recommended to damage the germinative tissue following extraction.",

In these circumstances, the surgical procedure time should be as short as possible, and special attention should be paid to hemostasis at the surgical site. Monitoring oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry is mandatory for these surgical procedures.",

Even if this procedure can be combined with extraction procedures, the standard palliative approach is aimed at alleviating the obstruction without extraction of affected tooth/teeth. Reported variations of this permanent rhinostomy technique via a dorsal approach may or may not include the use of a stent.31, 34 The patient is placed in sternal recumbency with the head slightly elevated. The skin is incised over the midline with a linear incision or with a biopsy punch, as the rhinostomy site and the stent opening will be round. Rhinotomy of the nasal bones is performed with a 2.5-mm or 3-mm intramedullary pin, and the nasal cavity is exposed. A small, plastic catheter is cut to proper length and inserted into the nasal cavity, just dorsal to the mass if the goal is to keep the rhinostomy site open,37 or beyond (caudally) the pseudo-odontoma to allow passage of air into the rhinopharynx31, 34 (Fig. 17\n). The use of a metal stent has been reported.46 The stent can be removed or exchanged for a smaller one a few weeks postoperatively to keep the skin from closing over the bony rhinostomy opening. Advantages include short anesthesia and surgery time, simplicity, rapid recovery, and quick improvement of respiratory symptoms. However, it should be noted that this surgical option does not stop the dysplastic process; therefore, the rhinostomy site and/or the stent may eventually no longer be sufficient. Another disadvantage is that postoperative management of the rhinostomy site includes removal of mucus and debris. This may or may not be easy depending on the patient\u2019s temperament.",

Blunt dissection of the underlying soft tissues allows exposure of the lateral aspect of the incisive bone, and a specialized retractor (eg, the Lone Star Retractor; Lone Star Medical Products, Inc. Stafford, TX) is positioned. Osteotomy of the incisive bone is performed with a small 2-mm ball-tipped bur, until the reserve crown of the pseudo-odontoma becomes visible with the typical folds of dentine. The reserve crown is then meticulously worked with small dental elevators or contoured needles, to resolve ankylosis. However, the bone fenestration may not be sufficient to extract the pseudo-odontoma in one whole piece.
