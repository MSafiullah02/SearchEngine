            "text": "DENV is a flavivirus: a genus that comprises over 70 viruses, many of which are arthropod borne. Flavivirus particles contain a lipid envelope and an inner nucleocapsid composed of capsid protein and a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Cleaves and Dubin, 1979). During infection, the viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein, which is co- and posttranslationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into the structural proteins C, prM, and E and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (reviewed in Bartenschlager and Miller, 2008, Murray et al., 2008). The structural capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are components of extracellular mature virus particles; NS proteins are expressed within the infected host cell but are not detectable in virions. They are thought to be involved in DENV genome replication, which occurs in close association with cellular membranes. NS3 and its cofactor, NS2B, are involved in processing of the viral polyprotein. NS3 also has RNA helicase and nucleotide triphosphatase activity. NS5 has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and is involved in capping of progeny viral RNA genomes. The role of NS1 in RNA replication is not fully understood. Little is known about functions of the hydrophobic proteins NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B, but several studies suggest that they may anchor the viral replicase proteins to cellular membranes (Chambers et al., 1989) and contribute to virion assembly (Kummerer and Rice, 2002, Leung et al., 2008) and to inhibition of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 response (Mu\u00f1oz-Jordan et al., 2003). Finally, NS4A potentially plays a role in induction of membrane alterations, assumed to serve as a scaffold for the formation of the viral replicase complex (Miller et al., 2007, Roosendaal et al., 2006).",

RCs may promote efficient viral replication by anchoring the replication machinery in membrane compartments or by shielding it off from host defense mechanisms (Netherton et al., 2007, Novoa et al., 2005). Electron microscopy (EM) showed that DENV induces membrane alterations of various morphologies, including convoluted membranes (CM) and vesicle packets (VPs) (Grief et al., 1997). Immuno-EM studies indicated that VP and CM may represent the site of DENV replication and RNA translation/polyprotein processing, respectively (Mackenzie et al., 1996). Light microscopy studies showed that NS proteins localize to cytosolic, virus-induced structures (Kapoor et al., 1995, Miller et al., 2006, Miller et al., 2007, Umareddy et al., 2006) also positive for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).",

We extended this observation by raising rabbit antisera monospecific for NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 that were tested for light microscopy analysis of DENV-infected cells (\nFigures 1, S1, and S2). All antibodies displayed a distinct labeling pattern that was not seen in uninfected cells (Figure S1). This pattern, exemplified by the NS2B-specific labeling, consisted of cytoplasmic dot-like structures in the perinuclear area of the cell (Figure 1). They colocalized with dsRNA, a generally accepted marker for the (presumed) intermediates during DENV RNA replication (Figures 1D and 1E). An exception was NS5, which in agreement with previous reports (Buckley et al., 1992, Kapoor et al., 1995, Miller et al., 2006) localized predominantly to the nucleus of infected cells. However, biochemical fractionation experiments show that up to 30% of NS5 is in the cytosol and about 70% in the nuclear fraction (data not shown), arguing that cytosolic NS5 is poorly accessible to the used antibodies (but still detectable; see below). Thus, DENV NS proteins localize to conspicuous cytosolic structures that likely correspond to the site of viral replication.",

DsRNA was found as a discrete electron-dense structure inside (Figure 4F) or on the cytosolic surface of a subset of vesicles (Figure 4G), suggesting that dsRNA is present only in some of the vesicles at a given time point. The electron density detected along with the immuno gold labeling most likely is due to uranyl acetate that was used to contrast the labeled cryosections, although we cannot exclude the possibility that its formation was linked to the use of the dsRNA-specific antibody. However, uranyl acetate binds to phosphate groups present in nucleic acids, supporting the notion that the dsRNA-specific antibody indeed detected viral RNA.",

In contrast, vesicles, CM, and the cisternae found in their close proximity were clearly and specifically labeled for the ER markers PDI and calnexin (\nFigures 5A, 5B, and S4). The PDI labeling of the vesicles was relatively low compared to the ER labeling, suggesting that this protein may be partially excluded from these virus-induced membrane structures. Calnexin, in contrast, seemed enriched on the CM compared to the ER, while it was less abundant in vesicles. Finally, the limiting membrane of the dilated virus-containing cisternae and their lumen was labeled for calnexin (Figure 5B, arrowheads) and PDI (Figure 5A, arrowheads), respectively, defining this compartment as ER-derived. Thus, the vesicles, CM, and virus-harboring cisternae are derived from the ER.

Additional single virions were seen inside vesicles located in the periphery of the Golgi complex and in coated-membrane structures (Figures 7F and 7H and Movie S3, black arrowheads), strongly suggesting that individual virions are transported to the Golgi complex by secretory vesicles from peripheral ER cisternae, where they accumulate initially.",

Virus particles had an average outer diameter of 45.1 nm (\u00b1 2.7 nm, n = 56). Close inspection of the vesicles in 3D revealed that the inner vesicle membrane was often continuous with the outer ER membrane, connecting the lumen to the cytosol via a pore-like opening. Thus, the vesicles appeared as invaginations of the ER rather than as sealed single-membrane vesicles (Figures 7A\u20137C and 7E, white arrowheads). The membrane invaginations were seen irrespective of the sample preparation protocol (Figures S3A\u2032\u2013S3C\u2032, white arrowheads), but their visibility depended on the orientation of membranes perpendicular to the x-y plane of tomographic slices and was frequently hampered by a diffuse electron density at the cytosolic side of the vesicle pore (Figures 7A, 7B, and 7E). Upon Gaussian filtering of the 3D images, 58.2% (\u00b1 7.1%, n = 264) of the vesicles that were fully included in the volumes of ten different tomograms were found to display a pore and to be continuous with ER membranes (Figure S3). Each vesicle contained only one such pore, further suggesting that their inner membrane is an invagination of the ER membrane. Consequently, the lumen of most if not all of these virus-induced vesicles is topologically identical to and open toward the cytosol. Analysis of pores that were readily visible without filtering revealed that they were almost round and had an average maximum width of 11.2 nm (\u00b1 1.6 nm, n = 27). Thus, both the topology of the vesicle interior and the immunolabeling results are consistent with the conclusion that the vesicles are the site of viral RNA replication. Likewise, the size of the pore would allow release of viral RNA genomes to be used for RNA translation and virus assembly.",

The cytosolic space between the pores and opposed membranes was frequently filled with a diffuse electron-dense material (most obvious in Figures 7A, 7B, 7F, and 7H, white arrowheads). The ER/NE lumen directly opposite the vesicle pores often displayed small membrane invaginations (Figures 7D, 7E, and 7G and Movie S3, small arrows), which had a slightly bigger diameter (about 60 nm) than virions and contained a distinct electron density, indicating that they represented virus budding sites (Figures 7D, 7E, and 7G, small arrows). These putative budding sites were always found in close proximity to single enveloped virus particles inside the ER lumen (Figures 7B and 7I and Movie S3, black arrowheads), further suggesting that virus budding occurs on ER membranes in close proximity to the vesicle \u201cpores.\u201d Three-dimensional surface rendering of the ER and its associated membranes (Figure 7J and Movie S4) illustrates the above findings: a portion of the ER lumen (yellow) encloses numerous densely packed vesicles (light brown) and is tightly apposed to another ER/NE membrane (yellow, semi-transparent; only the outer NE membrane is displayed). This opposed ER/NE lumen contains single virus particles (red) and, in addition, displays a putative virus budding site (small arrow). Additional virus particles are found in more peripheral segments of the ER that are oriented toward the Golgi stack or in single vesicles in the periphery of the Golgi complex.

Induction of such membrane structures that most likely serve as a scaffold for the assembly of viral RCs has been described for virtually all groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, but their architecture and origin differ among various virus groups (reviewed in Salonen et al., 2005). The positive immunolabeling for PDI and calnexin (immuno-EM) as well as CLIMP63 (Miller et al., 2006) shows that the DENV-induced membrane structures are derived from the rough ER. Immunofluorescence-based localization of the smooth ER marker Syntaxin17 (Steegmaier et al., 2000) to the membrane structures also implicates smooth ER in the formation of virus-induced compartments. By using ET, we could unambiguously show that all these membrane structures are interconnected and part of a single ER-derived endomembrane system, providing a platform for the transport of viral proteins and genomes between RNA replication vesicles, ribosome-containing membranes (RNA translation), and virus assembly sites. By TEM, the vesicles to which all of the tested NS proteins localized appeared as \u201cfree\u201d DMVs or as single vesicles in the ER lumen. We show that their appearance depends on the sample preparation protocol, a fact that should be considered when analyzing the ultrastructure of membrane rearrangements induced by other RNA viruses. Three-dimensional analysis of the vesicles reveals that they are invaginations of the ER membrane. Thus, the inside of the vesicles is connected to the cytosol and probably is the site of viral RNA replication, as indicated by the labeling for NS proteins and dsRNA. This result is reminiscent of an earlier report on DENV, in which colocalization of NS1 and dsRNA to VPs and cytoplasmic vacuoles was found in infected Vero cells and insect cells (Mackenzie et al., 1996). Our results do not, however, support the model by Uchil and Satchidanandam (2003), who proposed that flavivirus replication vesicles consist of a closed inner vesicle surrounded by an outer membrane that is continuous with CM and the ER. In contrast, we show that the interior of the vesicle is connected to the surrounding cytosol by a pore, which only became visible by use of ET. The pore may regulate import of factors required for RNA replication as well as export of newly synthesized genomes to be used for translation or virus assembly (see below).",

            "text": "The most striking observation from ET was the identification of virus budding sites in close proximity to the pores of replication vesicles. It has been assumed for a long time that flaviviruses acquire their envelope by budding into the ER lumen, and here we provide a direct visualization, in 3D, of this process. Our results not only reveal the DENV budding sites, but also allow us to draw a model of how the topology of DENV-induced membrane rearrangements may contribute to the different steps of the replication cycle (Figure 7L): upon infection, genomic viral RNA associates with ribosomes at the rough ER, where translation occurs. The resulting polyprotein is cleaved co- and posttranslationally, forming a membrane-associated RC. Whether polyprotein processing occurs in CM as proposed for Kunjin virus (KUNV) remains to be determined. Invaginations of the ER membrane are induced, presumably by NS4A, in conjunction with other viral and cellular factors (Miller et al., 2007) and give rise to membranous vesicles that are connected to the cytosol via a pore. We assume that the structural proteins core, E, and prM are excluded from these vesicles, an assumption that is supported by our immunolabeling showing NS proteins on one set of membranes and E on another set. Based on the dsRNA labeling, Bromo-UTP labeling of nascent DENV RNA (S.M. and R.B., unpublished data), and biochemical studies (Mackenzie et al., 1996, Miller et al., 2006, Miller et al., 2007, Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003), RNA synthesis likely occurs within the lumen of the vesicles. Nucleotides and other factors required for replication may enter the vesicle via the pore that also would allow exit of the newly synthesized RNA genome to the cytosol, where it is used for translation or particle assembly. Nucleocapsid formation and virus budding into the ER lumen occur in close proximity of such RNA exit sites. Although virus particles appear to accumulate in dilated ER cisternae, single virus particles contained in vesicles were often found at the cis-Golgi, arguing that single DENV particles are transported to the Golgi, where prM is cleaved by the cellular furin protease (Shapiro et al., 1997). The release of mature virus particles most likely occurs through the constitutive secretory pathway.",

DENV NS4A appears to contain a central peripheral membrane domain that intercalates into the lumenal leaflet of the ER membrane (Miller et al., 2007). NS4A oligomers would dilate the lumenal leaflet, resulting in membrane invagination toward the ER lumen, a topology that fits our observation. While this would explain how the vesicles are generated, we do not know how a pore of distinct size is formed and why the vesicles do not pinch off. One possibility is that the required host cell machinery is not available at these sites. Further studies will be required to clarify the molecular composition and biogenesis of the pores.",

Lee and colleague have recently provided evidence that DENV infection enhances autophagolysosome formation and that inhibition of the autophagic host cell machinery by phosphatidylinositol-3\u2032-kinase (PI3KC3) inhibitor 3-methyladenine reduces DENV titers (Lee et al., 2008). The effects are moderate, however, arguing that this pathway may contribute to DENV replication to only a minor extent. Whereas the double-membrane phenotype seen in our TEM resembles the membrane dynamics during autophagy, a role for this cellular process is unlikely, at least under the conditions used here. Hallmarks of autophagy include membrane wrapping, leading to a double-membrane compartment involved in lysosomal degradation. As shown unequivocally by our ET data, the DENV-induced vesicles are invaginations rather than sealed double-membrane vesicles, and our immunolabeling experiments that exclude lamp-1 from these vesicles do not support an involvement of lysosomes. We note that Lee and colleagues used a different DENV strain that may be more virulent than the New Guinea C (NGC) strain used in our study, which could account for the discrepant results.",

Assuming a volume of 0.655 nm3 per hydrated nucleotide, as estimated from the crystal structure of dsRNA (Johnson and Rueckert, 1997), and taking into account the genome length of the DENV NGC strain (about 10,700 nucleotides), a vesicle may harbor up to 50 single-stranded RNA molecules.

However, a similar role of CM for DENV remains to be demonstrated. Morphologically, the CM resembled smooth ER membranes, consistent with our finding that ribosomes were not detectable in their central region. In addition, the smooth ER marker Syntaxin17 was detected in DENV-induced membrane compartments. We speculate that CM might represent a storage site for proteins and lipids involved in DENV replication that can be recruited to vesicles upon demand. The fact that the CMs are continuous with the vesicles and contain NS3 would be consistent with this proposal.",

In the case of FHV (Kopek et al., 2007), newly synthesized viral RNA and the sole replication factor, protein A, were found to colocalize in invaginations of the outer mitochondrial membrane. These spherules have a diameter of about 50 nm and are connected to the cytosol via a necked 10 nm channel. It is assumed that this pore allows exchange of factors required for RNA replication as well as release of progeny RNA. Formation of the spherule is induced by protein A oligomers that appear to bend membranes in a process similar to viral matrix proteins. Kopek and coworkers have also calculated that one spherule of FHV contains, on average, only three RNA replication intermediates. These results reveal a surprising parallel to the DENV-induced vesicles, supporting the assumption of an evolutionary conserved mechanism.",

This observation is reminiscent of the complex ER-derived network described here in DENV-infected cells. Surprisingly, however, the inner membrane layers of the SARS-CoV DMVs were sealed, whereas neck-like connections were detected between the outer layers of different DMVs. This topology raises the challenging questions of how such large (200\u2013300 nm diameter) sealed vesicles form and how viral RNA is released to gain access to ribosomes and the structural proteins. While the underlying mechanisms are not known, evidence was obtained that the membrane network involved in RNA replication is continuous with membranes involved in virus assembly (Knoops et al., 2008), arguing that these two processes are tightly coupled.",

RNA replication is thought to occur on the cytosolic surface of these ER-derived vesicles, primarily at sites where vesicles cluster, whereas RNA translation may take place primarily at the more distal sites of these structures. However, in poliovirus-infected cells, membranous structures with two lipid bilayers have also been detected that may be induced by a process analogous to the formation of autophagic vacuoles (Schlegel et al., 1996).

However, the induced membrane alterations are much more heterogenous, with irregular assemblies of membranous vesicles that vary in size and profound alterations of presumably ER-derived membranes. At variance with flaviviruses, the membranous web of HCV contains interspersed lipid droplets that play a major role in the assembly of infectious virus particles (Boulant et al., 2007, Miyanari et al., 2007, Shavinskaya et al., 2007).

Fixed cells were high-pressure frozen/freeze substituted with acetone/0.1% osmium tetroxide as described (Buser and Walther, 2008) (Figure 2E) or postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr on ice and dehydrated in a graded acetone series at room temperature (all other figures). Samples were embedded in epoxy resin (Roth; Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were obtained with a Leica Ultracut UCT Microtome and diamond knife, counterstained with lead citrate, and examined with a Philips BioTwin CM120 TEM (120 kV) or a Zeiss 10C TEM (80 kV). For ET, 250\u2013300 nm thick sections were prepared as described elsewhere (Hoog et al., 2007). Unstained grids were placed in a high-tilt holder (Model 2020; Fischione Instruments; Corporate Circle, PA), and digital images were recorded as single- (Figure 6C) or dual-axis (all other tomograms) tilt series (FEI 4k Eagle camera; binning factor 2, binned pixel size 0.592 nm (Figures 7F\u20137I), 0.998 nm (Figure 6C), or 1.18 nm (Figure 6A) on the specimen level) over a \u221260\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 tilt range (increment 1\u00b0) at a defocus of \u22120.2 \u03bcm on an FEI Tecnai TF30 microscope operated at 300 kV. Tomograms were reconstructed using the IMOD software package (version 3.12.20) (Kremer et al., 1996). The Amira Visualization Package (version 5.2.0, Visage Imaging) was used for 3D measurements, surface rendering, and Gaussian image filtering (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 kernel). All 3D surface models were generated from unfiltered tomograms by manually masking areas of interest, thresholding, and smoothing labels, followed by manually filling gaps and additional smoothing when necessary to render the surfaces more continuous. Tomograms were denoised using a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion algorithm for presentation in Movies S1\u2013S3.",

(L) Model of the relation between DENV replication, assembly, and virion release. Upon infection, the viral genome associates with the rough ER (ribosomes in blue), and the viral polyprotein, composed of the structural proteins (red) and the NS proteins (green), is synthesized on rough ER membranes. NS4A, together with other viral and perhaps cellular proteins, induces invaginations of the ER membrane, leading to the formation of vesicles that are connected to the cytosol via a pore. Inside these invaginations, RNA replication occurs. Viral capsid protein associates with progeny RNA genomes liberated through the pore-like structure into the cytosol. Virus budding occurs through the ER membrane located in close proximity to or opposite of the vesicles. Individual virions travel toward distal sites of the ER lumen, where they collect in dilated ER cisternae. They are transported, likely as individual virions, via secretory vesicles to the Golgi complex, where virion maturation occurs.
