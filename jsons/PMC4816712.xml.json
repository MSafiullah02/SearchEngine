The percentage of the lung positively labeled for MERS-CoV antigen was quantified by the ImageScope positive pixel count algorithm (Figure 4E). At both 3 and 6 dpi, common marmosets had a higher mean percentage of the lung positively labeled for MERS-CoV antigen than rhesus macaques. At 3 dpi, 14.5% of the pulmonary parenchyma in marmosets contained viral antigen, significantly higher than the 3.6% detected in the lungs of rhesus macaques (P = 0.030). Although statistics could not be performed at 6 dpi because there were only two animals at this time point, a higher percentage of the marmoset lung still labeled positive for viral antigen than the rhesus macaque lung at this time point (9.3% versus 2.4%). The results from the quantification of pulmonary MERS-CoV antigen fit with previously reported pulmonary viral RNA loads detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Retrospective pooling and reanalysis of pulmonary viral RNA load data from rhesus macaque10, 12 and common marmoset lung tissues9 show that at 3 and 6 dpi, common marmosets had significantly higher pulmonary viral RNA loads (P < 0.0001), which were up to 1000 times higher than rhesus macaques necropsied at the same time point (Figure 4F).",

By 6 dpi, the difference in the mean percentage of the lung infiltrated by neutrophils, B lymphocytes, and macrophages had increased in marmosets compared with macaques; however, the few animals necropsied at the 6 dpi time point prevented statistical analyses from being performed at this time point. In macaques, at 6 dpi, there was a decrease in the mean percentage of the lung infiltrated by B lymphocytes and macrophages, which was associated with a decline in pulmonary viral antigen and viral loads. These results suggest that the viral infection was being cleared from the lung and that the inflammatory process was starting to resolve. At 6 dpi, the mean percentage of the lung infiltrated by neutrophils in rhesus macaques was similar to that at 3 dpi.

The exact reason for the variation in virus replication rates in the lungs of these two nonhuman primate species is unknown. The difference in pulmonary viral loads was most likely not caused by differences in DPP4 expression, because the location and extent of DPP4 expression in the lungs was similar in the macaques and marmosets. The pulmonary viral load disparity may be because of differences between old world and new world primates in their susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and virus replication, with rhesus macaques being less susceptible, or differences in the innate local immune response to a viral infection in the lung, which could lead to variations in MERS-CoV\u2013induced disease severity. Differences in viral loads and virus replication or disease severity between old world and new world primates have been described for other viral infections.21, 22, 23 In addition, anatomical differences between the respiratory tracts of marmosets and macaques may also influence disease severity. Although the greater pulmonary viral load and its injurious effects on the pulmonary parenchyma are likely responsible for the increased inflammatory response observed in common marmosets, alternatively, it is possible that the more robust pulmonary inflammatory response in the marmosets may have promoted MERS-CoV replication, causing higher pulmonary viral loads in this primate species. It has previously been described that proinflammatory mediators and pathways can enhance replication of influenza A virus and herpes simplex virus type 124, 25, 26; similarly, MERS-CoV replication may be enhanced in a proinflammatory environment, resulting in the higher viral loads observed in common marmosets. The increased pulmonary neutrophil infiltration at both 3 and 6 dpi, rather than the pulmonary viral load alone, in the marmosets likely caused the increased extent of the pulmonary lesions, which led to the development of more severe clinical signs. These results suggest that increased virus replication, along with an intense local immune response to MERS-CoV infection, may result in the development of severe respiratory disease.",

Although both nonhuman primate models can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of this disease, each model may be used for different applications. Rhesus macaques can serve as a model for mild MERS-CoV disease, which is increasingly being reported in humans infected with MERS-CoV.27, 28 Common marmosets are the more suitable model for severe, potentially fatal, cases of MERS-CoV disease, which are typically reported in individuals who have an underlying comorbidity or in individuals of an older age. The severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia that develops in common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV makes marmosets an ideal model for testing the efficacy of medical countermeasures, such as antivirals, therapeutics, and vaccines. The smaller size of common marmosets favors this model for drug studies because it significantly lowers drug quantities; however, it precludes repeated blood sampling within a short time frame, and fewer species-specific reagents are available for marmosets compared with rhesus macaques. These limitations suggest that rhesus macaques may be a more suitable model for vaccine studies if repeated analysis of immune parameters is warranted. Although each model may be better suited for various applications, together, these two nonhuman primate models will aid in investigations aimed at combating the ongoing occurrence of human cases of MERS-CoV disease.",
