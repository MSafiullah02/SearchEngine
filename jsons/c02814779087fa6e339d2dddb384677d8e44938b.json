[7] Hexanucleotides do not adopt stable intramolecular secondary structures and, in the case of the target HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT), [3] they apparently enter the process of target recognition as a quasi-one-dimensional chain which, subsequent to binding, adopts a structure that sterically and chemically fits with the local target structure. Alternatively, higher-order structures formed by hexanucleotides may be biologically active complexes such as the Gquadruplex-forming G 5 T in the case of the 3C proteinase of HAV. [10] The complete relevant sequence space to be considered for hexanucleotides comprises 4096 (= 4 6 ) linear species. Selecting target-binding species from this library in solution in a one-round approach is conceivable and should be much less labor-intensive than amplification-based methodologies. However, combinatorial approaches in solution are hampered by fundamental disadvantages that cannot be excluded or even reasonably controlled, including the formation of higher binding-competent complexes among individual species, interference of hexanucleotides in the formation of specific hexamer-target complexes, unequal representation of the sequence space, and technical hurdles including cloning steps, which are elaborate for short oligonucleotides.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 208, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 910, "end": 914, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Since hexanucleotides are sufficient for specific binding to proteins at K d values in solution in the micromolar range, [3] it is attractive to consider a combinatorial setup in which the complete hexanucleotide sequence space is immobilized on a solid support in an arraylike fashion.

Firstly, a control array was produced onto which a set of known oligonucleotides was printed; these had been investigated previously in the use of HIV-1 RT as a target protein in solution [3] (see the Supporting Information, Table S1 ). This set includes RT-binding and nonbinding hexanucleotides, longer oligonucleotides mimicking a polymerase template strand, and an RT-directed DNA aptamer. [8] The oligonucleotides were attached to the solid support by means of nonnucleotidic linkers of varying length (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1a ) in order to avoid additional unspecific interactions with the target protein of interest. Initially, deoxyribonucleotides were chosen which showed patterns comparable with ribonucleotides. Only minor differences have been observed between the two types of strands, including chemically modified derivatives thereof. One exception is phosphorothioate derivatives which led to higher affinity but loss of specificity. [3] It should also be considered that downstream optimization steps of hexanucleotide-based leads will include a substantial variation of the nucleic acid unit including the sugar moiety. In a first round of studies, control arrays were exposed to HIV-1 RT at concentrations between 5 nm and 5 mm, and the best signal strength and signal/noise ratio were observed at protein concentrations higher than 5 nm (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1b ). Those concentrations are surprisingly low; this represents a substantial technical advantage when one considers, for example, the apparent K d of 5.7 mm for Hex-S3 for binding with HIV-1 RT in solution. [3] Most importantly, the binding pattern of the hexanucleotides tested reflects their binding behavior with RT in solution in a qualitative manner. [3] On the technical level it is noteworthy that the best results were obtained with a linker length of 21 and 38 atoms, whereas longer linkers were related to loss of signal ( Figure S1c ). It is important to note that a similar dependence on linker length was also observed when bound proteins were detected by antibodies after binding to arraybound hexanucleotides. The two independent sets of consistent signal data indicate that processes such as quenching do not have a major influence on signal strength. In sum, these control array-based experiments provide strong evidence for the feasibility of exploiting the complete array-bound hexanucleotide sequence space to systematically screen for species that bind sequence-specifically to HIV-1 RT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 508, "end": 511, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1086, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1743, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1892, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 347, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 654, "end": 664, "text": "Figure S1a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1533, "text": "Figure S1b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2076, "text": "Figure S1c", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Next, an array consisting of 4096 hexanucleotides was processed as depicted in Figure 1 a.

Well-characterized hexanucleotides that bind HIV-1 RT, and controls, such as longer oligonucleotides and nonbinders, [3] were included (see the Supporting Information, Table S1 ). A typical binding experiment with fluorescently labeled HIV-1 RT (Figure 1 b) shows a large dynamic range of signals indicating clear discrimination of RT for the printed nucleotide sequences. This pattern is compatible with the pattern generated by controls used for validation on the control array and in solution binding studies. It should also be noted that in some cases we never identified a hexanucleotide binding to a protein target. For example, no binding was observed for array-attached hexanucleotides to firefly luciferase. This is consistent with a SELEX experiment in solution that did not reveal a luciferase-specific aptamer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 79, "end": 87, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 458, "end": 466, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 535, "end": 547, "text": "(Figure 1 b)", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "To study even more rigorously the specificity of the binding of HIV-1 RT to the hexanucleotide we investigated the signal pattern of the RT of HIV-2. The polymerases of both viruses are highly homologous in primary and tertiary structure; [9] thus, HIV-2 RT may serve as one of the most stringent controls for the specificity of hexamer/HIV-1 RT interactions. The signal pattern produced for the two related target proteins, however, is clearly different (Fig-Figure 1 . a) Array-based screen for protein-hexanucleotide interactions. Hexanucleotides are covalently attached to the surface through a nonnucleic acid linker (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1a ) thereby avoiding non-sequencespecific interactions. In order to visualize hexanucleotide-target interactions, proteins may be labeled fluorescently, radioactively, by biotin, or an antigenic domain for subsequent immunodetection. Here, hexanucleotide binding was monitored by using fluorescently labeled protein. After a blocking and binding step, the arrays were washed and dried.

On the contrary, different sequences displayed different specificities towards the target protein, strongly indicating that the interactions identified here are mostly dependent on the pattern of functional groups of nucleobases. This finding suggests that this kind of arraybased technology can serve as a powerful tool for the systematic search for hexanucleotide binders which, subsequently, can be optimized by adjusting the chemical modifications on the sugar moiety, the nucleobases, and the internucleotide phosphates or additional substituents. In this way the limited complexity of oligonucleotides in the first array-based screen, that is, 4096 species, can be substantially extended by additional chemical modifications and might approach the complexity of systematic combinatorial methods that start with more species in the starting pools.
