The disease has spread rapidly from Wuhan to other parts of China and even around the world. The new novel coronavirus was identified in samples of airway epithelial cells from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of COVID-19 [6]. After a month, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7]. As with the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, there is evidence of human-to-human transmission, extensively in family settings, but also in hospitals [8\u201313].",

Internationally, cases have been reported in 213 countries, areas or territories [15]. At present, information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 is scarce. Taizhou is a prefecture level city of Zhejiang Province with a population of 6 million. However, Taizhou has a large number of people engaging in trade and learning in Wuhan. According to statistics alone, there were more than 20,000 people returning from Wuhan to Taizhou when the epidemic started. Therefore, Taizhou has become one of the main outbreak places of imported cases. Given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, an analysis with larger sample size cases in Taizhou is urgently warranted. Here, by collecting the data from 145 laboratory-confirmed cases, we sought to provide an up-to-date delineation of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 throughout Taizhou. The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to compare severely ill patients with non-severely ill patients.",

Complications among the 145 patients included sepsis (36.6%, 53/145) and ARDS (0.07%, 1/145). Severely ill patients were more likely to have sepsis than non-severely ill patients (67.4% vs. 23.5%, p < 0.01). Most patients received oral antiviral therapy [97.2%, 141/145, (lopinavir/ritonavir, 96.2%, 138/145, or arbidol, 43.4%, 63/145)], atomized inhalation of interferon therapy (96.6%, 140/145), and traditional Chinese medicine treatment (90.3%, 131/145). Many received glucocorticoid therapy (32.4%, 47/145), intravenous immunoglobin therapy (28.3%, 41/145), and antibacterial therapy (19.3%, 28/145). Compared with non-severely ill patients, the proportion of severely ill patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoid therapy were higher (83.7% vs. 4.9% and 88.4% vs. 8.8%, both p < 0.01), and the course of antiviral treatment was longer (mean, days, 20.29 vs. 15.69, p < 0.01). A total of 67.6% (98/145) of the patients received oxygen therapy, and the rate of this in severely ill patients was as high as 100% (p < 0.01). Of the 43 severely ill patients, 14% (6/43) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 2.3% (1/43) received invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, severely ill patients had prolonged length of hospital stay compared with non-severely ill patients, [median, days, 22(15.5\u201325.5) vs. 13(9\u201318), p < 0.01].",

As with previous studies [21], there were no gender difference between severely and non-severely ill patients in our study. Our study has shown that severely ill patients had a higher APACHE II score and a higher SOFA score. In addition, we also found that severely ill patients had a higher MuLBSTA score than non-severely ill patients. The MuLBSTA score is an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia [22]. However, since there are no deaths in our study, further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in COVID-19.",

Thus, non-severely ill patients with absence of fever may be missed if the surveillance case definition focused heavily on fever detection. Consistent with previous studies [18, 21, 23], our study also found that the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients decreased, and it was more obvious in severely ill patients. Severely ill patients were more likely to show prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, a higher level of troponin I, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin than non-severely ill patients. These results further confirm that pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocard injury, and hepatic injury [21]. Our study found that in the lung imaging CT of severely ill patients were mostly bilateral pulmonary lesions. This suggests that perhaps bilateral pneumonia is one of the risk factors for severely ill patients.",

According to the suggestion of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by SARS-CoV-2 (version 7) [19], all of the patients in this study received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol), aerosol inhalation of interferon-alpha and traditional Chinese medicine treatment. 19.3% received antibiotic therapy, and 28.3% received intravenous immuno-globulin (IVIG). Because severely ill patients are more likely to suffer from lymphopenia, intravenous immunoglobulin have been given to enhance the anti-infection defense reaction of severely ill patients [23]. In addition, among our cohort of 145 confirmed patients with COVID-19, glucocorticoid was given to 8.8% of non-severely ill patients and 88% of severely ill patients. However, the use of glucocorticoid is still controversial. According to WHO interim guidance, glucocorticoid should not be routinely given systemically [16]. Another study has shown that clinical evidence does not support glucocorticoid treatment for COVID-19 and that no benefit was observed from glucocorticoid support [24]. However, according to the study of Jinyintan Hospital [23], it is suggested that steroids (methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg per day) are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic glucocorticoid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients with COVID-19. 90.3% of patients have been treated with traditional Chinese medicine. In another report [25], traditional Chinese medicine (Shufeng Jiedu Capsule) treatment has also shown a certain improvement of the clinical symptoms.",

Second, because some critical ill patients were transferred to provincial medical institutions for unified treatment, only one critical ill patient was monitored in our study. Thus, our research may not be applicable to critically ill patients and differences in prevalence of comorbidities might go undetected.
