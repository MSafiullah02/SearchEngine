That meningitis could be caused by other \u2018filterable agents\u2019 (i.e., viruses) was demonstrated by Rivers and Scot, who in 1935 recovered lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from the CSF of an affected patient. It is now known that a wide and constantly changing variety of viruses may invade the CNS to produce meningitis or encephalitis.",

First, viral meningitis must be differentiated from the much more dangerous condition, bacterial meningitis: Until this is accomplished, patients presenting with signs and symptoms of meningitis must be considered medical emergencies, and antibiotic treatment for presumptive bacterial meningitis must be instituted. Second, viral meningitis, although rarely fatal, may produce clinical impairment that can persist for weeks to months, especially in the immunosuppressed patient. Finally, \u2018lymphocytic\u2019 or \u2018aseptic\u2019 meningitis may be caused by agents other than viruses, and the possibility of other, more readily treated (and sometimes more dangerous) conditions must be kept in mind when diagnosing a patient with presumed viral meningitis.",

            "text": "Before meningitis can occur, the causative agent must first penetrate the body from the external environment and then gain entry to the CNS across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Entry of the virus into the host may occur by gastrointestinal inoculation (as is the case with the enteroviruses), cutaneous inoculation (as occurs with the arthropod-borne agents), the respiratory route (as is the case with mumps), or transmucosal penetration or intravenous inoculation (as occurs with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Early workers in the field of viral CNS infections believed that invasion of the nervous system occurred by the spread of viruses along neurons, as is the case with rabies virus. Currently, however, it is known that the majority of viral meningitis results from hematogenous dissemination of virus following symptomatic or clinically inapparent systemic infection. Penetration across the BBB may occur at the choroid plexus or through meningeal capillaries. Exceptions to this include meningitis following genital herpes simplex infection, meningitis associated with herpes zoster, and Mollaret's meningitis, in which reactivated infection of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) within the dorsal root ganglia leads to repeated episodes of meningitis. Viral replication in the meninges, superficial brain or spinal cord parenchyma, and the ventricular system elicits an inflammatory response, which is predominantly lymphocytic. This results in an alteration of the BBB so that protein levels increase within the CSF. Unlike bacteria or fungi, however, viral replication does not lower glucose within the CSF, nor does it usually results in altered transport of glucose across the BBB. Thus, in contrast to bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal infections, CSF glucose concentrations during viral meningitis are usually normal.",

Enteroviruses are small, nonenveloped single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses within the family Picornaviridae. Although more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses have been identified, coxsackievirus A9 and echoviruses E7, E9, E11, E19, and E30 account for 70% of all cultured isolates of CSF. Poliovirus, although no longer found in developed countries due to mass vaccination efforts, still causes aseptic meningitis and paralytic disease in countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria where cultural taboos, lack of development, and war have stymied vaccination efforts. Enteroviruses are disseminated by fecal\u2013oral spread, and cases in developed countries cluster during summer months when sanitation tends to be most relaxed. Recent studies employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, however, confirm older observations that enteroviral CNS infections occur throughout the year, and many previously undiagnosed cases of viral meningitis occurring during winter months are also caused by these viruses. Coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses may cause encephalitis and, rarely, paralytic disease, especially in neonates and the immunosuppressed. This was vividly illustrated in 2012 with the enterovirus 71 outbreak in Cambodia that killed more than 60 children.",

Although these agents are most commonly considered to cause encephalitis, all of them, with the exception of eastern equine encephalitis, more frequently cause meningitis. The most common domestic arthropod-borne agents associated with viral meningitis include St. Louis encephalitis virus, the California/LaCrosse group of viruses, Colorado tick fever, and West Nile virus, which caused an explosive outbreak when it first arrived in the United States in 1999 and more recently in 2012.

HSV-1 and HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and HHV-6 all cause viral meningitis. Of these, however, only HSV-2 has been associated with a significant number of cases. Older data suggest that HSV-2 accounts for 2\u20133% of viral meningitis cases. Recent work employing PCR suggests that it may be the most common cause of viral meningitis in adult women. HSV-2 most often causes meningitis following primary genital infection. Occasional cases may also follow primary genital infection with HSV-1. Patients with recurrent (Mollaret's) meningitis often have recurrent infection due to HSV-2. CSF pleocytosis occurs during both chicken pox and herpes zoster with or without skin lesions; this pleocytosis is usually asymptomatic but may occasionally be associated with meningitic symptoms. HSV-2 is also the most common cause of nonepidemic viral encephalitis, commonly producing an asymmetric lesion in the anterior and medial temporal lobes. In the immunosuppressed and elderly, VZV can cause a multitude of other CNS syndromes including stroke due to vasculitis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, myelitis, encephalitis, and cranial neuropathies. CMV can cause ventriculitis and radiculitis in patients with HIV. Lastly, HHV-6 is now appreciated to produce a bilateral medial temporal lobe encephalitis in bone marrow transplant patients.",

Onset is most commonly at the time of seroconversion, and for the astute clinician, this represents an opportunity to make an early diagnosis of HIV during a period of time when the patient's viral load is very high, and thus, is at high risk for transmission. The course may be uniphasic, chronic, or, occasionally, recurrent. In recurrent cases that happen despite the patient achieving systemic virologic control with antiretroviral medications, the differential diagnosis should include the possibility of CNS HIV escape either due to a resistant strain of HIV having evolved in the CNS compartment or due to inadequate CNS penetration of antiretroviral medications. HIV RNA can be identified in CSF using reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) methods, which also allow an assessment of viral burden and the resistance mutation profile. Although HIV itself typically causes a CSF pleocytosis of less than 20 cells/mm3 with a mild-to-moderate elevation in total protein. Cell numbers higher than this should raise early suspicion for a concomitant CNS infection like syphilis, Cryptococcus, VZV, HSV, or CMV.",

In these countries, mumps virus is an important cause of sensorineural deafness.

Wild and laboratory mice are the natural hosts, and there is recent evidence that snakes harbor these viruses as well. LCMV is associated with human cases of meningoencephalitis as a consequence of exposure to laboratory or wild mice, and in rare epidemics it is associated with pet hamsters. Cases are more common in impoverished areas with poor hygiene. Important outbreaks of fatal LCMV meningoencephalitis have also occurred in clusters of solid organ transplant patients infected by organs from asymptomatic donors. LCMV meningitis typically occurs during autumn and early winter, and it has been suggested that this reflects more extensive mouse\u2013human contact as mice move inside to escape winter weather. In studies before 1960, the virus was thought to account for 9\u201311% of cases of viral meningitis. In recent years, reports of meningitis due to LCMV have been rare. However, congenital LCMV infection is a significant, often unrecognized cause of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, and mental retardation. Acquired LCMV infection likewise may be an underappreciated illness. The meningitis caused by LCMV may be extremely persistent and has been associated with symptoms and CSF abnormalities lasting for months. Acquired LCMV infection may also be associated with encephalitis, transverse myelitis, a Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9-type syndrome, and both transient and permanent hydrocephalus.",

Immunocompromised patients may have even more subtle exam findings and histories, and there should be a low threshold for further investigation with lumbar puncture in these cases. Seizures or focal neurological signs are unusual although cranial neuropathies are seen with certain viruses like VZV, HSV, West Nile virus, and HIV. Focal signs should raise concerns about a concomitant viral encephalitis or a focus of infection, such as a brain abscess. Patients are usually uncomfortable but do not appear severely ill. Physical examination may reveal evidence of systemic illness, including rash, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, or splenomegaly, depending on the infectious agent. Neurological examination commonly reveals nuchal rigidity with the patient unable to touch chin to chest. Resistance to passive neck flexion and Kernig's and/or Brudzinski's signs may be present but are inconsistent. Both signs may be absent in milder cases. A useful test of nuchal rigidity is to ask the patient to touch forehead to knee; this will often be positive when all other tests of meningeal irritation are questionable or absent.
