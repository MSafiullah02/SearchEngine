In 1573, Xin\u2019an county was established and was entitled to administer Hong Kong for more than two hundred years since that time. Following the end of the first Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842 ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain in perpetuity. Kowloon, Stonecutters\u2019 Island and some small islands were annexed in 1860. In 1898, Britain acquired, under the \u2018Treaty of Peking\u2019, what is known as the New Territories and 236 associated islands, which were mainly agricultural lands, which were leased from the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131910), on a 99-year lease. At present, Hong Kong consists of the island of Hong Kong (83 sq. km), Stonecutters\u2019 Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories on the adjoining mainland, with 1,068 sq. km of land and a population of just over six million.",

In July 1993, financial movements were able to extend from individual to business activities, and furthermore banks in the Taiwan area were able to receive funds sent indirectly from mainland China.

On June 30, 2010, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) was signed between and the ARATS and the SEF, both of which represent the governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China (mainland China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan), respectively. The ECFA is a preferential trade agreement that aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two sides. For a long period of time, the Chinese government uses its influence on neighboring economic powers to prevent them from signing free-trade agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan. Instead, under the leadership of the Kuomintang, Taipei was motivated to sign the ECFA with mainland China partly in hope that once it has this agreement the PRC will stop pressuring other countries to avoid such agreements with Taiwan. The ECFA has been compared with the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements (CEPA) signed by mainland China with its two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau).",

Historians have identified many factors leading to the shortness of the Qin empire, which include, among others, Qin Shihuang\u2019s tyranny, harsh law imposed on the lives of people, large expenditure on big projects (such as the Great Wall) and persecution of Confucianism. The direct cause of the Qin\u2019s collapse, however, was initially connected with a long-distance trip of the border patrol led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang. For example, the following was reported in Sima Qian\u2019s (104 BC) famous book Shiji (historical records): In 209 BC, Huhai, the second emperor of the Qin dynasty, ordered 900 people in the region of Huaihe river to Yuyang (today\u2019s Miyun county in northeast Beijing) to serve as border patrol. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, who were among them, were appointed leaders of the troop. When people arrived in Dazexaing (in southwest of today\u2019s Suxian county, Anhui province), due to heavy rain, the roads were damaged and their trip to the destination was delayed. According to the Qin\u2019s penal code, those in military service would be executed if they failed to keep their appointments, so these people faced the threat of death. Since Chen Sheng and Wu Guang had long been dissatisfied with their poverty-stricken life, and now faced the treats of death, they decided to initiate an uprising to \u2018save\u2019 themselves. Soon, many people joined (including Xiang Yu and Liu Bang) and the uprising spread across the country. They led the peasants to attack and occupy finally Chen County (today\u2019s Huaiyang in Henan province), and they established their own regime entitled Zhangchu. Then their army sent by Chen Sheng to fight against Qin army was defeated by Zhang Han. Later, Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were murdered by their subordination. And the rest of the army was surrendered to Liu Bang and Xiang Yu. In 206 BC, the Qin dynasty came to an infamous end.\n",

The paths of caravan traffic are often called the \u2018silk route\u2019 because the route was used to export Chinese silk to the Roman Empire. Chinese armies also invaded and annexed parts of northern Vietnam and northern Korea toward the end of the second century BC. Han control of peripheral regions was generally insecure, however. To ensure peace with non-Chinese local powers, the Han court developed a mutually beneficial \u2018tributary system\u2019. Non-Chinese states were allowed to remain autonomous in exchange for symbolic acceptance of Han lordship. Tributary ties were confirmed and strengthened through intermarriages at the ruling level and periodic exchanges of gifts and goods. In 25 AD, after years of chaos, the new Han ruler moved its capital from Chang\u2019an (today\u2019s Xi\u2019an) to Luoyang in the east.",

In the Tang dynasty, the Chinese culture influenced as far away as India in the western side of the Himalayas and Japan in the east.

However, at the late stage of the dynasty, the huge size of the territory and the capital\u2019s proximity to the north and the west frontiers were full with domestic chaos and invasions by barbarians.

Economically, Kaifeng was a better choice, given its convenient transport and communication facilities. This can be witnessed by the rapid economic, commercial, and technological developments enjoyed by Kaifeng and by China as a whole during the North Song dynasty (AD 960\u20131127). However, Kaifeng was not an ideal city for military purposes, since it was so near to its northern enemies that no geographical barriers (with the exception of the Yellow River) could protect it from invasions. Clearly, this has been witnessed by the forced abandonment of Kaifeng and northern and central China by the Song court in 1127; as a result, the Song\u2019s capital was moved from Kaifeng southwardly to Lin\u2019an (today\u2019s Hangzhou).

Then, why was Yuan\u2019s capital transferred from Karakorum (in modern Mongolia) to Beijing? The first possible driving force for the southward move of the capital might be the change in territorial size. As a result of the fall of the Jin and the Song courts, most of Chinese territory, formerly under the control of the Jin and the Song dynasties, had been under the Mongol\u2019s control. If Karakorum is a geographically optimal location as the capital for the Mongol state (AD 1206\u20131271), ceteris paribus, the optimal location for the capital of the newly established, spatially enlarged dynasty, the Yuan should move to the south.",

Long wars with the Mongols and the Manchus in the north and the harassment of Chinese southeast coastal areas by the Japanese in the sixteenth century weakened Ming rule.

If political and economic factors were not quite responsible for these differences, geographical factors (size and location) must have contributed. Furthermore, we can find that the three Korean dynasties had significantly different lifespans. For example, the Koryo dynasty (915\u20131392 AD), with its capital in Kaesong, and the Chosen dynasty (1392\u20131910), with its capital in Seoul, lasted for 477 and 518 years, respectively, and could have been even longer had the two dynasties not been invaded by external forces. By contrast, the unified Shilla dynasty (668\u2013915 AD), with its capital in Kyongju, only lasted for 247 years, which is less than that of the Koryo, and even less than half that of the Chosen.
