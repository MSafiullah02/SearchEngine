Telepalliative medicine has been used to great effect in outpatient and home-based palliative care, but has had fewer applications in the inpatient setting. As we plan for decreased provider availability due to quarantine and redeployment and seek to reach increasingly isolated hospitalized patients in the face of COVID-19, the need for telepalliative medicine in the inpatient setting is now clear. We describe our rapid and ongoing implementation of telepalliative medicine consultation for our inpatient palliative care teams and discuss lessons learned and recommendations for programs considering similar care models.",

The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) then limited in-hospital personnel to essential providers only. On March 15 th , UCSF instituted a hospital-wide visitor ban with exceptions for patients at the end of life. Personal protective equipment (PPE) scarcity then prompted calls for minimizing inperson visits by providers. Finally, on March 16 th , UCSF opened its first closed COVID-19/respiratory illness unit with 31 negative pressure rooms. In the setting of these rapid and unprecedented changes, our Inpatient Palliative Care Services (PCS) team recognized that telepalliative medicine consultation would be critical to protect providers, limit PPE use, and provide adequate services to patients throughout the hospital and especially within closed COVID-19 units.",

We already observe increased psychosocial, spiritual, and existential suffering. Anxiety and hopelessness are exacerbated by the social isolation of hospitalized patients. Goals of care conversations will be imperative as part of a strategy to avoid painful resource allocation decisions, and restrictions on visitors make family meetings impossible without the use of technology. Moral distress, trauma, and helplessness for providers will be elevated in caring for isolated ill and dying patients. These diverse needs will fast outstrip the current inpatient palliative care workforce, especially if providers are limited by personal illness or if team members are reassigned to help in other areas.",

Some consults will still require in-person consultation, for example when patients are hard of hearing, unable to use technology, or require physical examination. However, in most cases, PC providers can apply their skills of listening, perceiving, and connecting via video. Telepalliative skills are novel and take time to develop.

Preventing provider illness enables individuals to continue to provide care and preserves our most precious resource: the limited palliative medicine workforce. Moreover, remote consultation decreases PPE use and ensures first responders and bedside providers are protected for the duration of this crisis.

For example, UCSF is currently embarking on ways to equip rooms with video capability connected to hospital room phones, allowing providers to call in and \"ring\" patient iPads to immediately and automatically activate their videoconferencing to perform visits. This type of intervention has the potential to revolutionize inpatient medicine. The great hope for our field is that we emerge from this crisis as leaders not only in humanistic patient care, but also as leaders in our health systems and experts in novel technology to deliver quality care.",

This is especially critical for our patients with COVID-19, who are isolated in hospital rooms, unable to see or touch loved ones, and rarely interact with health care providers covered in PPE. Tellepalliative medicine provides the opportunity -particularly by video -to connect to patients, connect them to others, and provide as intimate and interdisciplinary support as possible in these times.",
