Because a vaccine against the virus will not be available in the near future, we herein try to offer a pharmacological strategy to combat the virus. There exists a number of candidate drugs that may inhibit infection with and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Such drugs comprise inhibitors of TMPRSS2 serine protease and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Blockade of ACE2, the host cell receptor for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of TMPRSS2, which is required for S protein priming may prevent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Further, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and off-label antiviral drugs, such as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs arbidol and favipiravir as well as antiviral phytochemicals available to date may prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic.",

Epidemiology thus far suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [12] . Multiple mechanisms now identified in the infective and replication processes of SARS-CoV-2 offer targets for pharmacological interventions. Infection of pneumocytes, macrophages and pulmonary mast cells requires viral S protein. This invasion process which involves attachment of S protein to the ACE2 receptor is facilitated by host cell derived serine protease TMPRSS211 [8] . Agents that inhibit TMPRSS211, such as camostat mesilate, may be useful in blocking viral host cell entry. After host cell entry, the viral single-stranded positive RNA, is released for replication of virus RNA and translation of virus polyproteins that are finally cleaved into mature effector proteins by virus proteases [13] . The S protein interaction with ACE2 on host cell cytoplasmic membrane initiates viral infection. Strategies capable of disrupting S protein interaction with ACE2 could be of significant therapeutic value, because the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 is 10-20-fold higher than for the S protein of SARS-CoV which may contribute to the higher contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SARS-CoV [12] . Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have only 79% genomic sequence similarity, they share a highly conserved receptor binding domain for their S proteins [1] There is also potential for targeting other highly conserved proteins associated with SARS-CoV and SARS-Co-V-2, including RdRP and 3Clpro (also termed Mpro), which share over 95% similarity between the two viruses, despite only 79% genomic sequence sharing.",

In a screening approach of about 1,100 drugs approved by the FDA, nafamostat mesilate has been identified to inhibit MERS-CoV S protein-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mediated viral membrane fusion with TMPRSS2-expressing lung Calu-3 host cells by inhibiting TMPRSS2 protease activity [35] . Since the S proteins of MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 share considerable amino acid sequence homology [1, 9] , nafamostat mesilate may also inhibit cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. In cell culture experiments with simian Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, nafamostat mesilate was shown to be inhibitive against SARS-CoV-2 infection at EC50 of 22.50 \u00b5M [36] , suggesting that nafamostat mesilate is able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It was demonstrated recently that also SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for S protein-driven host cell entry [8, 9] . Therefore, ACE2 constitute a molecular target to inhibit cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, ACE inhibitors as standard drugs for the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure fail to inhibit ACE2 [40] , but a number of other drugs and compounds have been shown to inhibit ACE2.",

Chloroquine phosphate inhibits terminal phosphorylation of ACE2, and hydroxychloroquine elevates the pH in endosomes which are involved in virus cell entry [44, 45] , both mechanisms constitute relevant antiviral mechanisms of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In vivo, hydroxychloroquine is metabolized into chloroquine. Chloroquine phosphate has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV infection and spread in vitro [44, 46] , and results from very recent studies reveal that chloroquine phosphate and, more effectively, hydroxychloroquine also inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in simian Vero cells [46, 47] . By using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine in human lung fluid, it was demonstrated that the concentrations of hydroxychloroquine recommended for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection comprise an oral loading dose of 400 mg twice daily at day 1, followed by an oral maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f days [47] . These results were deduced from in vitro data obtained from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells treated with hydroxychloroquine [47] . A recent pilot trial conducted in more than 10 hospitals in Wuhan, Jingzhou, Guangzhou, Bejing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Ningbo, China, with more than 100 patients with COVID-19 disease demonstrated that treatment with chloroquine phosphate is superior to control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting laboratory virus-negative conversion, and shortening the course of COVID-19 disease [48] .",

Remdesivir acts early in infection, and decreases viral RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner that parallels impairment of viral load in vitro [78] . These and related mechanisms of action of remdesivir have been demonstrated in vitro for SARS-CoV [78] , Ebola virus [79] and MERS-CoV [80] . A recent study demonstrates in cell culture experiments with simian Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 that remdesivir is inhibitive against SARS-CoV-2 infection at EC90 of 1.76 \u00b5M, a concentration achieved in vivo in nonhuman primate models [36] . It was further shown that remdesivir efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human liver cancer Huh-7 cells, which are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [36] .

Recently, the X-ray structures of the unligated SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro and its complex with \u03b1-ketoamides designed as specific inhibitors of 3Clpro were reported [126] . Two pyridine-containing \u03b1-ketoamides, designated 13a and 13b, displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and were detected at sufficient concentrations in lung tissue and broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid within 4 hours to 24 hours after subcutaneous administration, demonstrating lung tropism of the compounds [126] . Besides subcutaneous administration, inhalation of nebulized 13b by mice resulted in high and long-lasting (24 hours) concentrations in lung tissue, without any adverse effects [126] , pointing out a role of pyridinecontaining \u03b1-ketoamides in COVID-19 therapy. In a recent study that employed combined structureassisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening, a mechanism-based inhibitor of Mpro, termed N3, was identified by computer-aided drug design [127] . N3, a Michael acceptor inhibitor that can inhibit the Mpros of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was shown to form a covalent bond with and to be an irreversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [127] . Further, in a highthroughput screening approach for identifying inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, ebselen, an organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective properties, was identified [127] . In a plaque-reduction assay with simian Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, N3 and ebselen displayed antiviral and cell protection efficacy at EC50 values of 16.77 \u00b5M and 4.67 \u00b5M, respectively [127] , ultimately demonstrating their antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-2.",

Favipiravir inhibits replication of a large number of RNA viruses, including influenza A virus, flavi-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, arena-and noroviruses as well as West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth-disease virus, Ebola virus and Lassa virus [120,121]. In a historically controlled, single-arm proof-of-concept trial conducted in response to the Ebola virus outbreak in September 2014 in Guinea, ninety nine adults with confirmed positive semi-quantitative Ebola virus RT-PCR (results expressed in \"cycle threshold\" [Ct]) were treated with 6,000 mg favipiravir at day 1, followed by 2,400 mg favipiravir at days 2-10 [122].

SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause a severe bilateral pneumonia that may progress to multi-organ failure and death (COVID-19 disease), with a mortality rate of 2 % to 5 %[10], though this may be inflated, due to inadequate knowledge of the true number of cases, from countries which only test individuals with strong symptoms. Many cases appear to be mild or even asymptomatic, so the true number of cases remains unknown. Since no vaccine will be available for large populations until the end of 2020, it is mandatory to identify approved off-label and experimental drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Such drugs may constitute inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and ACE2, established antimalarial drugs, antiviral drugs inhibiting viral RNA polymerase, proteases and virus/host cell membrane fusion as well as phytochemicals with antiviral activity, as reviewed herein. Besides preventive strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection practiced in many countries, such as quarantine of confirmed infected individuals, contact tracing by smartphone, protection of individuals at high risk of infection, nationwide limited curfew, and the urgent development and rapid provision of a vaccine, the WHO and the European Union recently and urgently initiated clinical trials to test remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon \u03b2-1a in COVID-19 patients worldwide in the SOLIDARITY Trial [141] and in the DisCoVeRy Trial [91]. Based on the experiences with infections by other viruses, such as HIV and influenza virus, post-exposure prophylaxis with candidate drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection may be effective in preventing disease after potential exposure to the virus or positive test results, and in reducing the risk of secondary virus spread and COVID-19 disease. Candidate drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be clinically J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Moreover, administration of the antiviral candidate drugs shortly after symptom onset may reduce infectiousness to other individuals by diminishing viral shedding in the respiratory secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients that usually peaks at 5-6 days after symptom onset and lasts up to 14 days [142] (albeit shorter time courses of nasopharyngeal viral shedding, peak: day 4, end: day 7, have been reported in mild cases of COVID-19 [143]), and prophylactic treatment of contacts could reduce their risk of becoming infected. Further, due to their wide safety profile, less pharmacological side effects and easy availability, phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, emodin and resveratrol with postulated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease may be used by large populations for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in COVID-19 disease. Interestingly, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, the ribonucleoside analog \u03b2-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931), with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in mice and against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelial cells has been recently developed for the treatment of newly emerging coronavirus infections of the future [144].Finally, in the urgent case of the accelerating COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of pharmacological antiviral prophylaxis and treatment of large populations has several requirements regarding high efficacy, drug safety, high availability, and economy.",

Other small-peptide and tripeptide inhibitors have been developed for potent and selective inhibition of human ACE2 and inhibition of SARS-CoV cell entry in vitro[64][65][66]. More recently, synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of human ACE2, including TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE) small-molecule inhibitor TAPI-2 that blocks SARS-CoV S proteininduced shedding of ACE2[69,70] have been developed for experimental inhibition of SARS-CoV cell entry. Moreover, the phytochemical nicotianamine (CAS number: 34441-14-0), a metal chelator ubiquitously present in higher plants[71], was identified in high concentrations in soybean, and was shown as a potent inhibitor of human ACE2 with an IC50 of 84 nM[72]. Because dietary phytochemicals as naturally occurring compounds display a wide safety profile and less pharmacological side effects[73], nicotianamine constitutes a candidate drug for ACE2 inhibition and thus blockade of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.
