Many countries appear to have succeeded in containing the disease and preventing further spread. Vietnam was the first country to report that no new cases had been found for 20 days (three times the mean incubation period [1]), thus removing Vietnam from the list of countries with local transmission of the disease. In China, however, the situation remains disturbingly out of control. WHO epidemiologists have recently gained access to military compounds housing SARS patients, and in collaboration with the Chinese health authorities they are trying to establish procedures for assessment and containment of the disease. In accordance, the latest reports from Beijing and the Guangdong province show that the number of new cases may have begun to decline. However, WHO officials have cautioned against any clear conclusion that the SARS outbreak in China has peaked, as many factors that influence the outbreak's future evolution remain unknown. For example, half of all new probable cases in Beijing do not have any recorded previous contact with a SARS patient [2]. A study by Donnelly et al. [1], including 1425 cases from Hong Kong, has investigated the key epidemiological determinants for the spread of the SARS virus: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 6.4 days (range 2\u201316 days), and the mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 3\u20135 days.",

Clinical specimens from patients with SARS have been searched for unknown viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques. The identified coronavirus was isolated in cell culture, and a sequence of 300 nucleotides in length was subsequently obtained by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) random amplification procedure. On the basis of the obtained sequence, conventional and real\u2010time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus have been established. Subsequent detection of the virus in a broad range of clinical specimens from patients fulfilling the clinical case definition, but not in controls, has been used to validate the detection assays. Virus from sputum samples has been able to infect and exhibit cytopathic effect in vero E6 cells [7, 8]. In addition, the presence of virus has been demonstrated in a suspension of kidney tissue obtained by autopsy, and serologic evidence of virus antibodies has been demonstrated in serum and faeces obtained during the convalescent phase. The above findings and the recent demonstration that SARS virus fulfils Koch's postulates [11] lead to the conclusion that SARS is caused by a novel 29 kb single\u2010stranded RNA virus, either alone or as a coinfection with another infectious agent.",

Virus particles have been shown to be fairly stable, remain infectious for up to 48 h after drying on plastic surfaces and possibly up to 4 days in faeces from patients with diarrhoea [13]. These findings may partially account for some of the observed clusters of outbreaks, as 66% of the Amoy gardens patients presented with diarrhoea compared with only 2\u20137% in other local outbreaks [13]. Case clusters seem to have played a key role in the early stages of the epidemic [1], and the possible existence of so\u2010called super\u2010spreaders (individuals causing an unusual large amount of secondary cases) has been the subject of some speculation. These would explain some of the apparent disproportionate features observed when tracking disease spread; however, little evidence has been produced in support of this hypothesis.",

The clinical characteristics of the disease likewise suggest a predilection for the respiratory epithelium of upper and lower airways (i.e. fever, dry cough, dyspnoea and hypoxia). Paraclinical findings include air space shadowing predominantly in lower lung zones on chest X\u2010rays and CT scans, consistently excluding interstitial patterns. The characteristic finding on CT was bilateral peripheral air\u2010space ground\u2010glass consolidation mimicking bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia [3, 8, 14, 15]. In close to half of the cases, the resolvement of pulmonary infiltrates is associated with the appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Histological examination of lung tissue from fatal cases show diffuse alveolar damage similar to that observed in early ARDS [3, 16]. Pathological changes include epithelial cell proliferation, the presence of giant cell infiltrates and an increase in pulmonary macrophages. Haemophagocytosis suggestive of cytokine dysregulation has been demonstrated in a subset of patients [16, 17].",

In humans, the corona virus is a frequent cause of the common cold presenting as coryza, cough and general malaise. Numerous biologically distinct avian and mammalian coronaviruses have been isolated. Different strains have the ability to genetically recombine [18]. Phylogenic analysis of the SARS genome and of representatives of the three known groups of coronaviruses revealed that the proteins encoded by the SARS virus do not cluster within any of the three serogroups [7, 8, 19, 20]. SARS virus is most closely related to the group II family of coronaviruses with whom it shares 50\u201360% nucleotide sequence homology. It has been suggested that SARS virus can be ascribed as the first representative of a possible fourth serogroup of coronavirus [19]. Coronaviruses are large RNA viruses characterized by a distinctive morphology (Fig. 2A), replication strategy, genomic organization (Fig. 2B), and sequence homology (Fig. 2C). Nearly all known coronaviruses are host specific, although a few strains are capable of crossing the species barrier (e.g. the bovine coronavirus which can infect several species both in vitro and in vivo) [18]. SARS virus can enter and replicate in both African Green Monkey kidney (vero E6) cells [7, 8, 19] and in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK\u20104) [21]. This observation suggests that SARS could be unusually indiscriminate regarding target cells and organisms.",

The prefix corona is derived from the \u2018crown\u2010like\u2019 appearance of the envelope proteins seen in the electron microscope. Coronaviruses have the largest genomes of all known RNA viruses (27\u201332 kb).

The structural proteins include three surface glycoproteins \u2013 the spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane proteins (M) \u2013 as well as the capsid phosphoprotein (N), which encapsulates the RNA sense strand (Fig. 2A).

The first step in the viral life cycle of coronavirus consists of the binding of virions to the plasma membrane of susceptible cells through interaction between the viral S protein and specific host cell receptors (e.g. the human amino peptidase receptor) initiating binding, fusion, penetration and uncoating. As for all plus\u2010stranded RNA viruses, the first synthesis following entry is the translation of the viral genomic RNA to yield an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase. The plus\u2010stranded genomic RNA is then transcribed into minus\u2010strand RNA, which is used as template for the synthesis of plus\u2010stranded viral mRNAs and of genomic RNA. The first 60% of the length of the genome from the 5\u2032 end (approximately 20 kb) consists of two overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode the viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and other nonstructural proteins. These include a papain\u2010like protease, a 3C\u2010like protease and a helicase. A ribosomal frameshift mechanism initially translates ORF1a and ORFb into a large polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into multiple proteins by protease cleavage. N is translated on free polysomes, whereas both M and S are inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and transported to a Golgi\u2010associated complex [18]. Also, a fraction of S is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it plays a role in cell\u2013cell fusion. In brief, the formation of virions includes three steps: (1) binding of nucleocapsid to intracellular membranes that contain the M protein, (2) spike formation by the incorporation of S protein from a Golgi\u2010associated compartment at the time of budding and (3) release of virions by the budding of large intracellular vesicles [18].",

Increased knowledge of key events in the replicative cycle of SARS virus may thus facilitate the development of new antiviral drugs. The SARS virus entry receptor has not yet been found, but some coronaviruses, including the serogroup I coronavirus 229E, enter target cells by the binding of the S protein to human aminopeptidase N (CD13) [22]. In vitro, binding can be inhibited using antibodies against CD13, by soluble CD13 receptor and specific inhibitors of CD13 [23]. Analogous to the use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV infection, the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase is an obvious target of intervention as it is not naturally present in human cells. Ribavirin, an RNA\u2010nucleoside analogue that is effective in some cases of hepatitis C infection, has been tried in SARS\u2010infected individuals [7, 8]. However, no effect on the clinical outcome of SARS has been shown. The papain\u2010like protease, 3C\u2010like protease and helicase found in coronaviruses also offer possible targets for the introduction of SARS\u2010specific protease inhibitors. Based on the analysis of the crystalline structure of the coronavirus (strain 229E) 3c\u2010like protease, Anand et al.

In contrast, commercially available vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated coronaviruses can induce neutralizing antibodies in the peripheral blood of immunized animals, but they only provide limited protection for the disease [25]. Serum antibodies against S, M and N proteins are produced in adult volunteers in response to inoculation and infection with human coronaviruses [26]. Infection of adult volunteers with 229E\u2010like coronavirus has been shown to confer immunity on rechallenge with the same strain 1 year later. However, infection with other 229E\u2010like coronavirus strains produced infection and illness [27]. It should be noted that all volunteers had antibodies against coronaviruses prior to infection with the 229E\u2010like strain, reflecting that coronavirus infection is common in humans [28]. As SARS has not previously infected humans, the lack of acquired immunity may increase the virulence and spread of the virus. Serum from SARS\u2010infected survivors who cleared the infection has neutralizing antibodies against the virus [5], indicating that a potential vaccine may be efficient. It is unclear whether an effective vaccine against SARS can be made using classical vaccine methods (recombinant proteins or inactivated or attenuated viruses) and whether cell\u2010mediated response is necessary for immunity.

In none of these studies has coronavirus been associated with significant mortality. Apparently, SARS does not cause as severe disease in children as in adults [1, 33]. Furthermore, the temporal pattern of clinical and radiological progression, the time of peak viraemia and pathological findings [17] suggest that the observed deterioration during the second week may be because of immunologically mediated tissue damage rather than uncontrolled viral replication. These findings have led to the inclusion of corticosteroids in experimental protocols, as these have proved to be beneficial in certain cases of ARDS [34, 35]. It could be speculated whether the damage inflicted by SARS could be caused by an adverse human immune response, thereby making infection at a young age an advantage. A distinguishing feature of SARS virus may be the ability to elicit an adverse immune reaction \u2013 a theory, which should spur efforts to further characterize the known immunogenic epitopes like the S protein and intensify the search for possible new antigens encoded by the SARS viral genome.",

However, the swift reaction from a globally united scientific community has secured a rapid identification and characterization of the pathogen causing SARS and has provided essential diagnostic tools at a staggering pace. The existing body of knowledge on coronaviruses presents scientists with a multitude of potential targets for medical intervention. In addition, the strategy for containment outlined by WHO has proved to be effective in industrialized as well as Third World settings. The question remains whether the disease is by now too far advanced in China to be contained. The upcoming season for dengue and influenza virus is bound to interfere with the rather vague clinical case definition and may render the present strategy for containment inadequate by exceeding the capacity of the Chinese healthcare system. Other coronaviruses are epidemic in nature [18] and if SARS is not eradicated, a similar pattern of cyclic outbreaks may be anticipated. There are numerous examples of the epidemiological consequences of introducing a novel pathogen in a previously unexposed population. If SARS becomes endemic, the development of immunity in the affected population may eventually decrease the mortality; however, there are a number of discomforting characteristics of this new pathogen. With the notable exception of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the majority of emerging infectious diseases since the 1980s have exhibited features limiting their capacity to pose major threats to international public health (e.g. West Nile fever requires a mosquito vector, Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease depends on food as a vehicle for transmission and Ebola/Marburg viruses render their host visibly ill and too unwell to travel). However, a distinguishing feature of SARS appears to be the absence of factors limiting disease spread. The consequences of SARS gaining foothold in densely populated countries with poor infrastructure like India and in areas with immunocompromised populations as seen in sub\u2010Saharan Africa could thus be grave.",

SARS virions are round, moderately pleomorphic enveloped particles, measuring 100\u2013150 nm in diameter and covered with a distinctive fringe of widely spaced, club\u2010shaped surface structures about 20 nm in length composed of the spike glycoprotein (S). The membrane glycoprotein (M) interacts with the nucleocapsid. The viral nucleocapsid consist of the 29.7 kb plus\u2010stranded genomic RNA and the capsid phosphoprotein (N). (B) Genomic organization of SARS. Overall organization of the 29.7 kb genomic RNA. Predicted open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b encode the RNA polymerase and nonstructural proteins, followed by S, E, M and N. Numbers above line indicate the start position of the ORF, and number beneath the line indicate the stop position of the ORF. The numbering is based on the genome of SARS virus deposited in GenBank, accession number NC_004718. (C) Phylogenic dendrogram of coronavirus spike glycoproteins. The length of each branch depicts relative sequence homology between the proteins. Shaded areas illustrate receptor clusters.
