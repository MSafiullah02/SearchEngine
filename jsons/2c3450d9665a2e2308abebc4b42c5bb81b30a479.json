We here the FRED tool, that takes a text an natural language and outputs a formalisation in description logic. FRED is a machine reader for the Semantic Web that relies on Discourse Representation Theory, Frame semantics and Ontology Design Patterns 6 [8, 12] . FRED leverages multiple natural language processing (NLP) components by integrating their outputs into a unified result, which is formalised as an RDF/OWL graph. Fred relies on Table 3 ). VerbNet [19] contains semantic roles and patterns that are structure into a taxonomy. FrameNet [5] introduces frames to describe a situation, state or action. The elements of a frame include: agent, patient, time, location. A frame is usually expressed by verbs or other linguistic constructions, hence all occurrences of frames are formalised as OWL n-ary relations, all being instances of some type of event or situation. We exemplify next, how FRED handles linked data, compositional semantics, plurals, modality and negations with examples related to Covid-19 :",
