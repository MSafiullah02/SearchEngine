They cause a wide spectrum of infections from skin and wound infections to septicemia and hospital outbreaks worldwide; both organisms are resistant to several classes of antibiotics making their treatment very difficult [1]. The MDR pattern can be transferred to the other organisms that initially do not show such resistance [2]. In addition, biofilm production in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa encourages increased colonization and persistence in hospital environments leading to higher rates of device-related infections [3]. To solve the problem of limited therapeutic options, it is very vital to find new therapeutic strategy to combat A. baumannii infections.",

Therefore, interfering with QS is considered as a promising strategy to combat bacterial infections by inhibiting bacterial virulence hence affecting the ability of pathogens to cause diseases rather than affecting their growth which does not impose a selection pressure and helps to avoid emergence of resistance [5]. Consequently, QSI would increase the susceptibility of the pathogen to host defense and clearance by the host immune system [6].",

Many compounds that function as QSIs can successfully inhibit P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii pathogenesis, but some of them have toxicity in human-like halogenated furanone compounds [9, 10]. Thus, it is more reliable to screen the approved drugs used for human therapy which already found in the market and have a known safety profile.

Pz value was calculated as the ratio of the diameter of the colony to the diameter of the colony plus that of the precipitation zone. The isolates were classified according to the method of Sanchez et al.

CV026 responds to C6-HSL and produces violacein, but in presence of QSIs, no pigment is produced. It is noticed that azithromycin and erythromycin formed an intense violet ring around the inhibition zone.

Biofilm and twitching motility were detected in all 20 isolates (100%), followed by esterase (n = 19) then surface-associated motility (n = 10). The least detected virulence was phospholipase (n = 8), while none of the 20 isolates produced proteolytic enzymes.

It has been speculated that TFP might be involved in the surface-associated motility of A. baumannii [68]. In the present study, 50% of A. baumannii isolates were positive in surface-associated motility. In agreement with our results, Era\u00e7 et al.

Any variation in the physical factors could have effect on motility; we also found that using low salt concentration in the media gives better motility. All the tested QSIs inhibited surface motility; \u2265 20% inhibition was observed in presence of azithromycin, erythromycin, and levamisole.

The in vitro results must not be considered as final applicable conclusions in clinical situations. Moreover, the behavior of bacteria in lab differs from that in human body, and characteristics of drugs in lab also differ from those in human body where the drug may undergo degradation, conformational changes, re-arrangement, and plasma protein binding. Therefore, all in vitro studies are considered as a beginning step and must be fulfilled with in vivo studies. To compensate this shortage in reaching the drug therapeutic plasma level with some drugs, it could be possible to use QSIs with high MIC values in topical formulations like dressings or ointments for skin and soft-tissue infections and aerosols for respiratory infections. Also, QSIs with high MIC can be tested in future study in combination with antibiotics using low concentration of these QSIs that not exceed their accepted therapeutic levels.",

Several studies have reported other numbers of bacteria injected in the mice, some agree with our number, and others differ [40, 83, 84]. This was strain-dependent, and many reports account this to the probable negative correlation between MDR phenotype and virulence [85, 86].

It was revealed that erythromycin showed higher binding affinity than SAM (the natural ligand of AbaI) while levamisole had the lowest binding affinity. Moreover, all drugs bound with the active site of the ligand-binding domain of AbaI by hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding. In addition, molecular docking study ranked the activity of the compounds as inhibitors for AbaR receptor with chloroquine being the most active, followed by propranolol with a score similar to the natural ligand. The binding interactions with the receptor were by hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding except levamisole, which had no H-bonding. Erythromycin exhibited the lowest inhibition for AbaR receptor. Therefore, the potential mechanism of QS inhibition by the 4 tested drugs may be due to either binding to the AbaI autoinducer synthase preventing AHL synthesis, or binding to AbaR receptor preventing AHL signal reception. Finally, erythromycin markedly inhibited QS in vivo and in vitro in A. baumannii isolates. This may be due to inhibiting the synthesis of AHL signals by erythromycin more than inhibiting signal reception. In addition, chloroquine inhibited QS in A. baumannii by inhibiting AHL signal reception more than AHL signal synthesis. Several studies performed the docking of QSIs against either LasR or RhlR of PAO1, and a significant binding potential to the active site of these proteins was revealed confirming the QS inhibitory activity [51, 53, 55].",

To the best of our knowledge, this study showed that antibiotics like erythromycin can inhibit QS beside their antimicrobial activity; the other tested drugs (i.e., chloroquine, levamisole, and propranolol) were studied for the first time as inhibitors for QS in A. baumannii. Results obtained from qRT-PCR, in vivo study, and molecular docking of 4 QSIs against AbaI and AbaR proteins could give a more confirmation of the mechanism of QS inhibition by the tested drugs. In addition, inhibition of QS using FDA-approved drugs present in the market is a promising strategy for inhibiting virulence without affecting microbial growth which could be used as a therapeutic alternative for traditional antibiotics. This could help in decreasing the selective pressure causing antibiotic resistance development. Future studies are needed to formulate the tested drugs in suitable dosage forms and to study their effects in vivo.",
