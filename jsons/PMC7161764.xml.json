Recently, CPV appears to be endemic in almost all populations of wild and domesticated dogs 2. Luckily, during the past decades, promptly vaccine injection for dogs has greatly reduced the incidence of canine infectious diseases 3. Moreover, safe and effective vaccines against canine infectious virus has been considered as essential vaccines that every dog should receive, which was designated as \u201ccore vaccines\u201d by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Biological and Therapeutic Agents 4, 5. Therefore, the vaccine efficacy and duration data of immunity should be timely evaluated, which means that it is very necessary and urgent to have a quantitative and real\u2010time method for detecting the corresponding infectious virus antibody in a sample.",

In clinical tests, annual revaccination has almost become the standard vaccination specification. However, some researchers have begun to oppose this reference time for the revaccination. Abdelmagid et al. found that the dogs responded with very high SN titers after 1 month of vaccination, the immunity to CPV lasted for at least 55 months, and the immunity persisted for more than 4 years in some dogs after vaccination 14.

            "text": "At present, the regular methods for the detection of canine virus antibodies are colloidal gold immunochromatography and ELISA in clinical samples. Colloidal gold immunochromatography is one of the fastest and most commonly used qualitative detection method, whose disadvantage is the inability to perform quantitative detection. Moreover, the ELISA method could realize quantitative detection, but its detected sensitivity is not high enough to cover the sample with low concentration CPV\u20102\u2010Ab. Therefore, it remains a big challenge to find a new approach to improve the detection sensitivity of infectious viral antibodies 17. However, polymer magnetic bead\u2013aided immunoassays, especially chemiluminescence immunoassay, have attracted more and more attention in the infectious viral antibodies detection because of its high sensitivity and specificity 10, 11, 12. Among the various chemiluminescent labels (e.g., the classic luminescent reagent luminol and lucigenin), acridinium esters are particularly attractive because they have high quantum yields with detection limits in the atto mole range 18, 19. Moreover, they exhibit fast light emission with simple chemical triggers and their small size permit simple labeling protocols for proteins and nucleic acids 20. Some earlier studies have reported the applications of acridinium phenyl esters in immunoassays and nucleic acid assays and pointed toward their potential as useful labels in clinical diagnostics 21, 22. In this study, we have established magnetic bead\u2013based chemiluminescence immunoassay using acridinium phenyl esters as chemiluminescent labels for detecting the concentration of anti CPV2\u2010Ab in sample.",

Most of the previous methods represented the antibody concentrations in titers, and they are only the semiquantitative method in the strict sense 23, 24, 25. This assay could detect quantitatively the concentration of CPV\u20102\u2010Ab within 1 H, and the sensitivity is 0.36 ng/mL. There is no obvious cross\u2010reaction happens with potential interferents. Also, compared with the ELISA commercial kits, high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9888) is obtained. Additionally, we also studied the reference interval between CPV\u20102\u2010Ab titer and concentrations, which increased user acceptability in the case of complete quantification.",
