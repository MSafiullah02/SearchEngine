Direct analysis of whole pathogenic microbial cells using MS without sample fractionation reveals specific biomarkers for taxonomy and provides rapid and highthroughput capabilities. MS coupled with various chromatography-and affinity-based techniques simplifies the complexity of the signals of the microbial biomarkers and provides more accurate results. Affinity-based methods, including those employing nanotechnology, can be used to concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions and, thereby, improve detection limits. Approaches combining amplification of nucleic acid targets from pathogens with MS-based detection are alternatives to biomarker analyses. Many data analysis methods, including multivariate analysis and bioinformatics approaches, have been developed for microbial identification. The review concludes with some current clinical applications of MS in the identification and typing of infectious microorganisms, as well as some perspectives.

Analysis of biological samples will always be challenging because of their great diversity and complexity (1 ) . The accurate identification of microorganisms using classic techniques is time-consuming and complicated. Early de-tection and characterization of microorganisms can help minimize health hazards and avoid the spread of microbe-related diseases. The requirements of modern methods suitable for microorganism identification and characterization are robustness, simple handling, low cost, rapidity, and high-throughput capability. Because it satisfies most of these requirements, mass spectrometry (MS) 2 is emerging as a technology capable of identifying microorganisms (1 ). Fig. 1 presents a flow chart of the microbial enrichment and analysis strategies used to identify microorganisms. In general, a sufficient number of microbial cells are collected, using culture or nonculture methods, before MS-based analysis. Nonculture approaches often use affinity techniques based on biochemical, chemical, and physical interactions with target cells. After collection of the cells, MS analysis of the samples is then performed. Direct sampling techniques such as bioaerosol mass spectrometry have been developed to analyze individual aerosolized microbial particles in real time. Coupling of nucleic acid amplification to MS combines the high amplification power of the former and the high mass-resolving power of the latter. To comprehensively investigate potential biomarkers, extraction of biomarkers from microbial cells followed by fractionation steps is conducted before mass spectrometric analysis.

The authors noted that species-or subspecies-specific markers in the spectra are sometimes difficult to identify because the number of overlapping signal ions increases along with the number of strains registered in the database.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 379, "text": "(52 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 694, "end": 699, "text": "(53 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data Analysis Methods"}, {"text": "The 2 mathematical methods used most often for the classification of spectral data are multivariate anal-ysis (MVA) and the artificial neural network (ANN). MVA is based on multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than 1 statistical variable (in this case, m/z) at a time. Many MVA techniques-including principal component analysis and cluster analysis-have been applied to the differentiation of microorganisms. The ANN is an algorithm for machine learning. This type of artificial intelligence allows the identification of biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing microbial species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data Analysis Methods"}, {"text": "Multivariate statistics is often used to analyze pyrolysis mass spectra of bacterial samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to pattern recognition of fatty acid methyl esters profiles obtained from B. anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholerae, Brucella melitensis, and F. tularensis (54 ) . PCA is the most commonly used multivariate data analysis tool. PCA is a technique for forming new variables (i.e., principle components) which are linear combinations of the original variables (i.e., m/z values in mass spectra). The principle components account for the differences among spectra. Ilina et al. (55 ) reported the direct bacterial profiling of 2 human pathogens, N. meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using MALDI-MS. Cluster analysis grouped mass spectra into clusters by measuring similarities between spectra. The method successfully separated the mass spectra collected from 3 groups that corresponded to the pathogenic and nonpathogenic Neisseria isolates. Because the protein chip technique SELDI may yield thousands of data points per bacterial sample, computer algorithms must be used to identify useful biomarkers for bacterial identification. Seibold et al. (56 ) differentiated single strains within the subspecies F. tularensis by combining SELDI-MS with cluster analysis and PCA. ANN combined with SELDI-MS has been used for the identification of N. meningitides (39 ) and S. aureus (57 ) . The relative abundance for each m/z value was used in the input layer of the ANN model. The output layer consisted of nodes representing target bacterial categories. The model was trained using bacterial spectra to generate good correlation between input and output layers. The model was further tested and validated using different sets of spectra. Demirev et al. (58 ) developed an approach for microorganism identification that combines MS with protein database searches. The protein masses in mass spectra are compared with those in the proteome databases. Probable organism sources are assigned to each mass, with the best match (i.e., that having the most matched proteins), in theory, leading to identification of the correct microorganism. When using this approach, spectral reproducibility is not critical as long as the observed masses match the protein masses in the database. To avoid the limited mass accuracy of protein mass measurements, the sequence information of the peptides from virus and bacterial samples has been used to identify the proteins and deduce the microorganism's source (59 ) . The sequence information can be derived from fragmentation of intact proteins or proteolytic peptides of the intact proteins by searching fragment ion (MS/MS) mass spectra against proteome databases. Top-down proteomics methodology identifies intact proteins without the need for biomarker digestion, separation, and cleanup. This methodology has been used successfully for microbial proteomics in the analysis of bacterial species, either pure or in a mixture (60, 61 ) . Microbial identification has been demonstrated using experimentally derived databases of virus-specific tryptic peptide masses (62 ) and bacterial protein masses (63 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 312, "text": "(54 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 612, "end": 630, "text": "Ilina et al.

Although enrichment of pathogens using functionalized magnetic particles has not been applied to clinical samples, the approach has proved successful for bacteria-spiked biological samples and should play an important role in the near future. Clinical specimens, obtained from pus, wound, sputum, and urine samples, have all been analyzed using selective CE-MS/MS methods (64 ) . The analyses of bacteria-specific marker peptides provided additional advantages of excellent selectivity and high confidence in microbial identification. The bacteria in these clinical samples were cultivated directly, without prior isolation of a pure colony, before performing the selective MS/MS analyses.

Direct MS-based analyses of microorganisms have a number of advantages, including rapidity and ease of operation. The MALDI interface is best suited for use in field-portable mass spectrometers deployed on battlefields or in our surroundings to detect microbial threats. Microbial analyses usually use a pure culture of microorganisms to avoid interference from the background-unless the interferents are absent (or removed) or data analysis algorithms are implemented.

Improvement of the detection limits for microbial cells will continue to be a major task in the years to come. To this end, cell enrichment through affinity techniques will play an increasingly important role. Top-down protein analysis and selective biomarker analysis coupled with affinity techniques will boost the detection capability and accuracy of microbial identifications. PCR amplification of nucleic acids and MS detection might be an alternative approach toward improving sensitivity, especially for the analyses of nonculturable microorganisms. In addition to MALDI, several new ionization techniques, including desorption electrospray ionization (72 ) , direct analysis in real time (73 ) , and ESI-assisted laser desorption ionization (74 ) , hold great potential for use in the real-time direct MS-based analyses of pathogens. Furthermore, advances in other MS-related technologies will provide more powerful tools for characterization of pathogens; these technologies include high-speed and highresolution LC, ion mobility spectrometry, and highcapacity linear ion trap and various high-resolution mass analyzers, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance, Fourier transform-Orbitrap, and time-of-flight mass detectors.
