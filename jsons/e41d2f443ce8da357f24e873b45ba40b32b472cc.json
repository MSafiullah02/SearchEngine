As COVID-19 predominantly affects adult patients, the question of how to re-allocate pediatric staff is challenging.",

In general, the unit charge nurse performed the initial screen for appropriateness of admission which included adults up 50 years of age and a limited number of comorbidities. If the patient did not meet these criteria, the attending physician did a further chart review to determine the appropriateness of admission to this unit. Because of the need for rapid transfer from the ED and the imperative to utilize all available beds to meet demand, the age and comorbidity restrictions for admissions were relaxed, particularly as the teams became more comfortable caring for adult patients. Patients were excluded from consideration for admission if the primary reason for admission was not management of COVID-19 or if they required ICU level care in the ED.",

Except to exclude patients who required ICU level care in the ED and limit the number of patient comorbidities, we did not limit admission of adult patients with COVID-19 based on disease severity. For example, 26% of patients required oxygen via non-rebreather mask and an additional 13% required intubation and either died or required ICU level care. The mortality rate of 6% is similar to the rate reported in Wuhan, China from a retrospective study by Zhou et al who noted 54 deaths (6.6%) for a cohort of 813 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19. 9 A report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality describes how pediatric hospitals should surge in response to emergencies that affect large numbers of children. 3 There is limited literature discussing how a children's hospital should respond when the surge is needed for adults. In addition to developing a multi-stakeholder team, ensuring system readiness for escalating care, partnering with adult-trained staff, and consideration of scope of practice 10 , we learned several lessons from our approach to transform a children's hospital unit to manage adults with COVID-19.",

For example, goals of care discussions were not left only to the Palliative Care team; all providers learned to lead conversations as patients' clinical status often changed relatively quickly. Familiarity of our system and our team members outweighed the lack of familiarity with the treatment and management of common adult medical conditions.
