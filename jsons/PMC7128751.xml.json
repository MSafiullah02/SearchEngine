The SARS experience in particular has taught the scientific community a very important lesson: that a global health crisis can be effectively countered and brought to an end through an international effort of communication and cooperation, as opposed to local initiatives or uncoordinated actions. This lesson has been widely accepted by the European infectious disease community and networking has become a major approach to tackling potential challenges, as demonstrated by the number of networks and collaborative projects funded by the European Community in the last few years: ENIVD (European Network for the diagnosis of Imported Viral Diseases) [5], EUNID (European Network of infectious disease physicians) [6], EURONHID (European Network of Highly Infectious Diseases) [7], ETHREAT (European training for health professionals on rapid responses to health threats) [8], ETIDE (European training for infectious disease emergencies) [9], RIVIGENE (Genomic inventory, forensic markers, and assessment of potential therapeutic and vaccine targets for viruses relevant in biological crime and terrorism) [10], the VHF-Variola PCR project [11], and Biosafety Europe [12], just to mention a few. In the present review, we present the main activities of the European Network of Biosafety-Level-4 (BSL-4) laboratories [13, 14] in the area of viral diagnostics and biosafety, and we discuss the challenges and critical points identified, as well as our future steps to ensure that Europe can be prepared to face an unexpected event involving a highly dangerous pathogen.",

Level two is intended for those that present a low to moderate risk. Level three is where potentially lethal pathogens are handled. The fourth level of biosafety is restricted to the most dangerous pathogens known to date, among which are the causative agents of viral haemorrhagic fevers and smallpox, usually referred to as risk group 4 (RG-4) agents in international laboratory biosafety guidelines [15, 16, 17] and European legislation [18, 19]; some of these agents are also included in the list of agents likely to be used as bioweapons [20]. Although the classification of infectious agents into four risk groups varies slightly according to the WHO, the European Community or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the levels of biosafety are clearly defined on the basis of the hazard posed to the health care worker or the community. An agent belonging to a given risk group will be handled at a corresponding or higher biosafety level, depending on the procedures employed.",

This aims to ensure that all activities are performed according to the basic principles of safety, which are translated into a set of strict procedures to guarantee that no infectious agent will ever escape from the laboratory. The highest level of biosafety is always required for the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines for RG-4 agents, as well as for testing the efficacy of new anti-viral drugs against them. The use of a BSL-4 laboratory is also strongly recommended when working on newly-recognized agents whose dangerousness has not yet been assessed.",

The network involves six partner institutions from five EU countries (UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy and France), with the addition of three other laboratories which are currently not funded by the grant, but are involved in the planning or construction of new European BSL-4 facilities, and participate in network activities as observers (one additional representation from Germany, one from Austria and one from France).

The first basic principle adopted in both is physical separation between the health care worker and the infectious material. To this end, the former type relies on personnel wearing positive-pressure suits connected by hoses to an air supply, whereas, in the latter, the same goal is achieved through the use of special sealed cabinets with built-in thick rubber gloves through which the health care worker reaches inside (Fig. 1\n, Fig. 2\n). Another important principle is containment, ensured by constantly maintaining the air inside the laboratory under negative pressure, and by the use of interlocked doors. Intake and exhaust air are filtered through high-efficiency particulate air filters: this is usually carried out once for intake air and twice for the exhaust. Among the procedures common to all BSL-4 facilities are the complete inactivation of all infectious waste leaving the laboratory, by autoclaving or chemical disinfection; and the lengthy exit procedures, which include a chemical shower to disinfect the external surface of the suit followed by a body shower, and the removal of all personal protective equipment in a precise order. Of the seven BSL-4 laboratories operating in Europe, four use protective suits and three use glove boxes. All are national reference centres funded by their respective National Health Authorities, and were built in compliance with national registration schemes and international guidelines. Their structural characteristics vary considerably as a consequence of the fact that they were built in different countries in the absence of specific regulations and over a period of two decades, rather than as a reflection of different biosafety requirements. The reaching of a consensus on a common standard for biosafety practices was discussed in project meetings and it soon proved to be a difficult objective to achieve; by contrast, there was unanimous agreement on the necessity to provide assistance to other European countries in the process of setting up high containment facilities, with the aim of making the experience of long-established facilities available to new ones from the initial planning stages.",

When one such outbreak occurs, effective infection control relies strongly on the availability of rapid and effective diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals and implement quarantine, especially for diseases for which there is no vaccine or treatment. Once again, the SARS epidemic in 2003 was an example of how the implementation of infection control measures, together with the effort of the scientific community to rapidly identify the aetiological agent, contributed to controlling the spread of the disease [42, 43, 44, 45].",

Nevertheless, it should be stated that these, perhaps \u2018old fashioned\u2019 and less sophisticated, techniques could turn out to be an invaluable tool when dealing with a mutated strain that escapes the highly specific binding requirements of molecular probes, and they should be considered in the context of an epidemiological and clinical picture consistent with a specific disease and a negative real-time PCR result.",

Furthermore, a feasibility exercise regarding the development of a mobile laboratory suitable for the safe handling of highly infectious pathogens (i.e. covering technical requirements for establishment, biosafety, maintenance, deployment and operation mode in the field, and budget estimation) will represent the stepping stone towards the beginning of virological field activities. Recent publications have shown how the deployment of mobile laboratories in outbreak areas may serve the dual purpose of diagnosing infected individuals early, therefore facilitating the implementation of effective isolation of cases, and improving the available diagnostic tests through validation against human sera collected locally [56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. The purpose of a European mobile BSL-4 laboratory (which, for all technical and biosafety aspects, is also suitable for BSL-3 agents) would be to perform diagnostics within Europe or in other countries where these agents are endemic or outbreaks occur. It would not only increase European preparedness by overcoming specific geographical weaknesses represented by countries for which BSL-4 laboratories are probably too costly to build, operate and maintain, but also, and above all, it would represent an invaluable support and back-up during scaling up of investigations in outbreak-prone countries, at the same time allowing the search for more accurate and faster diagnostic tools to proceed unhindered.",
