Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length human ACE2 in the presence of the neutral amino acid transporter B 0 AT1 with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 angstroms, with a local resolution of 3.5 angstroms at the ACE2-RBD interface. The ACE2-B 0 AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the collectrin-like domain of ACE2 mediating homodimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. These findings provide important insights into the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.",

During viral infection, the trimeric S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits and S1 subunits are released in the transition to the postfusion conformation (4) (5) (6) (7) . S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8) , whereas S2 is responsible for membrane fusion. When S1 binds to the host receptor ACE2, another cleavage site on S2 is exposed and is cleaved by host proteases, a process that is critical for viral infection (5, 9, 10) . The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 may also exploit ACE2 for host infection (2, (11) (12) (13) . A recent publication reported the structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and showed that the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the PD of ACE2 with a dissociation constant (K d ) of~15 nM (14) .",

Our structure of LAT1-4F2hc shows that the cargo LAT1 and chaperone 4F2hc interact through both extracellular and transmembrane domains (32) .

B 0 AT1 is not involved in dimerization, suggesting that ACE2 may be a homodimer even in the absence of B 0 AT1. Further examination suggests that a dimeric ACE2 can accommodate two S protein trimers, each through a monomer of ACE2 (fig. S9) . The trimeric structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was recently reported, with one RBD in an up conformation and two in down conformations (PDB 6VSB) (14) . The PD clashes with the rest of the S protein when the ternary complex is aligned to the RBD of the down conformation. There is no clash when the complex is superimposed on RDB in the up conformation, with a RMSD of 0.98 \u00c5 over 126 pairs of C a atoms, confirming that an up conformation of RDB is required to bind to the receptor ( fig. S9) (14) .",

Residues 697 to 716 form the third and fourth helices in the neck domain and map to the dimeric interface of ACE2. The presence of B 0 AT1 may block the access of TMPRSS2 to the cutting site on ACE2. The expression distribution of ACE2 is broader than that of B 0 AT1. In addition to kidneys and intestine, where B 0 AT1 is mainly expressed, ACE2 is also expressed in lungs and heart (27) . It remains to be tested whether B 0 AT1 can suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking ACE2 cleavage. Enteric infections have been reported for SARS-CoV, and possibly also for SARS-CoV-2 (36, 37) . B 0 AT1 has also been shown to interact with another coronavirus receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN or CD13) (38) .
