Interestingly, a statistically significant reduction of MTT-positive cells occurred in the first 60 min of treatment, and a more gradual decrease was observed during the following 8 h after the addition of 600 mM EtOH (Figure 1c). Annexin V-fluoroscein isothiocyanate (V-FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining were analyzed by flow cytometry, demonstrating a tendency but no statistically significant differences in cell death at this concentration of EtOH (Figures 1d and e). As a positive control, we confirmed that EtOH produced a significant increase in cell death at 1200 mM (Figure 1f) as previously described.35 The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was also performed and significant changes were observed between control (Figure 1g) and treated cells only at 600 mM EtOH concentration (Figures 1h and i). Although such small change seems unimportant, it marks the beginning of a cascade, which may threat the destiny of the cell.",

            "text": "LC3 is used as a specific marker of autophagosomes. LC3 exists in two different forms within the cell: LC3-I, which is distributed in the cytoplasm and LC3-II, which is converted from LC3-I and is covalently bound to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine in the autophagosomal membranes. LC3-II is therefore crucial to initiate the autophagosome formation. LC3-I function in the cell is autophagy independent. Indeed, LC3-I has been proposed to have a role in the vesicle-mediated removal of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) regulators.36, 37 Defectively folded proteins in the ER are selectively degraded by a group of proteins called ERAD. An increase of ERAD activity could lead to a degradation of correctively folded proteins, thus a correct regulation of ERAD is crucial to maintain cellular homeostasis. At steady-state, ERAD regulators are removed from the ER through a vesicle-mediated mechanism. LC3-I, therefore, has a role as a membrane-bound receptor that ensures the vesicle-mediated removal of ERAD regulators. Thus, GFP-LC3 overexpression is a well-accepted assessment of autophagosome formation. Small amounts of GFP-LC3 dots were observed (<9 dots) in control cells (Figure 3d). Conversely, the addition of 80, 200, 400 or 600 mM EtOH significantly increased the number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell and the percentage of autophagic cells (cells with >9 dots per cell) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 3e\u2013j). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the increase of the membrane-associated PE-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) in EtOH-treated cells, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 3a and b).",

We used the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), which clamps the degradation, to study the effect of EtOH on autophagy flux. Thus, based on the changes in the number of GFP-LC3 dots, these data indicated that there were not only an increase in autophagosome synthesis but also an increase in autophagic degradation (Figures 4a and b). For further analysis of autophagosome maturation, we took advance of the mRFP-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter.38 Administration of EtOH resulted in an increase of the percentage of autolysosomes (GFP\u2212/RFP+ dots), being significative at high EtOH concentrations (from 200 mM; Figures 4c and d). p62 is a key adaptor molecule associated with selective autophagy: it binds to both LC3 and ubiquitinated autophagic substrates so that they could be taken up by the autophagosome for degradation. Therefore, decrease of p62 seen in western blot (Figures 3a and c) in EtOH-treated cells would support an enhanced autophagic degradation. Hence, our results strongly suggest that EtOH enhances autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion.",

Optical microscopy images revealed that untreated ARPE-19 cells exhibited a polyhedral shape, broad cytoplasm and nuclei that included lax chromatin with multiple nucleoli distributed along the nuclear matrix and nuclear invaginations (Figure 8a). Despite the fact that 600 mM EtOH-treated cells showed reduced cytoplasm, no differences in core size, number of nucleoli or nuclear invaginations could be established. EtOH-treated cells presented numerous vacuoles (arrows in Figure 8b), which were eventually associated with clusters (arrows in Figure 8c). Another recurring element in 600 mM EtOH-treated cells was a spherical area with less affinity for toluidine blue and a diameter of approximately 20 \u03bcm (asterisk in Figure 8d). In addition, some EtOH-treated cells showed partial absence of cytoplasmic organelles (arrow in Figure 8e). These observations were confirmed by electron microscopy. As expected, no differences in chromatin or nucleoli could be set. However, non-EtOH-treated cells often showed long mitochondria with extensive ramifications and dense matrices with tubular crests (arrows in Figure 8f), whereas mitochondria from EtOH-treated cells were more dilated, tended to be spherical-shaped and matrices were clear with fewer crests (arrows in Figure 8g). It is interesting to note that endoplasmic cisterns occasionally formed structures adjacent to mitochondria and dense bodies, sometimes observed surrounding them (Figure 8h). Another observed feature was the frequent presence of vacuoles with heterogeneous content in cells treated with 600 mM EtOH, varying greatly in electrodensity, with high electron-lucent and even multilamellar aspects (arrows in Figure 8i). Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated filamentous structures organized occasionally in masses tending toward sphericity but also in bundles distributed throughout the cytoplasm (arrows in Figure 8j). Some of these mitochondria presented an increased size and contained heterogeneous dense bodies with very irregular crests that hindered their identification as such (Figure 8k).",

Surprisingly, no significant cell death could be established at 600 mM by flow cytometry.

Our data also indicated that the increase in the number of autophagosomes was related to an increase of autophagic flux (synthesis and degradation) rather than a decrease in autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion as previously reported in HepG2 cells.43 Autophagy flux analysis revealed that EtOH promotes autophagosome synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner as well as autophagosome degradation. Furthermore, EtOH decreases p62 levels, a key adaptor molecule associated with selective autophagy: it binds to both LC3 and ubiquitinated autophagic substrates so that they could be taken up by the autophagosome for degradation. EtOH treatment also increases the percentage of GFP\u2212/RFP+ dots. These two evidences demonstrated that EtOH increases autophagosome degradation by fusion with the lysosome. Although autophagosome synthesis is increased from 80 mM, autophagosome to lysosome fusion significantly increased only at high EtOH concentrations (above 200 mM). Our results are in agreement with previous works reporting that EtOH increases autophagy flux in liver and brain cells.14, 15",

Here, we report for the first time changes in ARPE-19 mitochondrial morphology following EtOH exposure leading to an increase of mitochondrial fragmentation in a concentration-dependent manner at every EtOH concentration, in agreement with previous works in liver and brain cells.14, 15 Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis also indicated a loss of normal mitochondrial morphology, tended to spherical and a loss of mitochondrial crests, confirming mitochondrial damage induced by EtOH. As reported before, one of the most interesting forms of autophagy is the one related to the degradation of fragmented mitochondria. Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the distance between autophagosomes and fragmented mitochondria that could be a prelude for mitophagy. Some of the most important changes after EtOH exposure are the mitochondrial morphology alterations, the lack of crests and the presence of heterogeneous bodies surrounded by ER. This is relevant because the ER\u2013mitochondria contact site has been suggested to be a key point to promote autophagy.48 Moreover, mitochondria inside vesicles were also observed. Besides, by using vinblastine (a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that induces accumulation of autophagic vacuoles by preventing their degradation, as mentioned above) we observed an increase of autophagosome\u2013mitochondria colocalization. This observation, together with the mitochondria\u2013autophagosome approximation, the unusual over-sized mitochondria with heterogeneous dense bodies, and the fact that mitochondria supply membranes for autophagosome genesis49 strongly suggest the occurrence of EtOH-induced mitophagosomes in ARPE-19 cells, in agreement with previous studies carried out in liver.50, 51",

Misfolded ubiquitinated proteins that cannot be degraded by the proteasome system are driven by the HDAC6, which recognizes the ubiquitin residue through microtubules to the aggresome, localized around the centrosome.40 Hence, the fact that 4-HNE colocalizes with ubiquitin, gamma-tubulin and HDAC6, and requires microtubules for its correct formation clearly demonstrated the aggresome nature of these 4-HNE aggregates. As reported previously,28 aggresomes could be degraded by autophagy depending on the proteins aggregated. The fact that 4-HNE colocalizes with LC3, and that 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor) increases the percentage of cells with 4-HNE aggresomes strongly suggest that EtOH increases aggresome degradation by autophagy (aggrephagy), and that EtOH does not alter autophagosome cargo recognition, as observed in a model of HD.53 Interestingly, Cuervo's group indicated that in their cell model, aggrephagy cannot be produced without inducing autophagy.39 However, in our model we found that control cells normally degrade 4-HNE inclusions. This can be due to the high autophagy levels observed in control ARPE-19 cells previously reported.4 Therefore, ARPE-19 cells are able to degrade damaged organelles without inducing autophagy.",

Thus, fragmented mitochondria are toxic for the cell, as well as aggresomes. Furthermore, after EtOH treatment, mitophagy and aggrephagy are enhanced. Therefore, we could hypothesize that autophagy promotes cell survival in ARPE-19 cells under EtOH exposure. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by 3-MA increases cell death (more than twofold) in EtOH-treated cells.

Both results are consistent with the effects of EtOH in brain cells.10 Furthermore, mitochondrial damage, protein aggregation and autophagy activation seem to be crucial processes in a RPE-related disease like AMD.55, 56 Considering that aggresomes are of relevance in neuropathology as much as mitochondrial fragmentation,57 our results describing a neurodegenerative-like phenotype in ARPE-19 cells induced by EtOH are novel and deserve further research, as they may contribute to the better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of other neurodegenerative diseases, including the formerly proposed \u2018alcoholic retinopathy'.12",

Autophagy was measured by quantifying the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 (autophagic cells). In fact, cells with more than nine autophagosomes were counted as autophagic. At least 200 transfected cells were counted for each condition. In addition, the total number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell was also measured, in at least 30 transfected cells per condition. To study the effect of EtOH on autophagosome maturation, ARPE-19 cells were transfected with an mRFP-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter that has been found to be useful to trace autophagosome maturation.59 Hence, within lysosomes GFP-LC3 fluorescence was quenched because of the sensitivity of GFP to acidic environments, whereas mRFP-LC3 fluorescence was more stable upon acidification. Thus, autophagosomes with a physiological pH show both red and green fluorescence (yellow dots), whereas the latter was lost in autolysosomes with an acidic pH (red dots). After overlapping images in both channels, the number of LC3 dots in each cell was analyzed: RFP+/GFP+ (yellow) dots as autophagosomes and RFP+/GFP\u2212 (red) dots as autolysosomes. Therefore, the percentage of red dots (RFP+/GFP\u2212) in each cell is a measure of the number of autolysosomes.59 At least, 30 transfected cells were counted for each condition. Cells were viewed under a laser scanning microscope (LSM 170; Carl Zeiss).",

A higher value of \u2018EtOH+CQ' compared with \u2018Control+CQ' indicates a net increase in these parameters, thus suggesting a promotion of autophagy process. The degradation, assuming at steady state, measures the increase caused by CQ, which otherwise would be degraded in the absence of CQ.
