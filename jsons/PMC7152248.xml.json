These are all double-stranded, ribonucleic acid (RNA), nonenveloped viruses with a diameter of about 80 nm (Fig. 18-1\n). The genus Rotavirus is subdivided into several groups (A-G) based on differences in the group-specific inner capsid protein, VP6. Equine and other animal isolates are in group A; groups B to G cause disease in humans, swine, fowl, and other animals.4 Further subdivision is made based on serologic assays using neutralizing antibodies to two outer capsid proteins, VP4 and VP7. Strains containing VP4 are referred to as P (protease-sensitive) serotype and strains containing VP7 as the G (glycoprotein) serotype, with many containing both.5 Strains are named based on the G and P genotypes. At least 7 G serotypes (G3, G5, G6, G8, G10, G13, and G14) and 6 P serotypes (P1, P3 P7, P11, P12, and P18) have been described in horses.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 The G3 serotype has been identified in Kentucky and Japan and has been used in equine vaccine trials.11, 12, 13 The G3P[12] and G14P[12] serotypes are among the most prevalent in foals and are the primary strains circulating in horse populations in many countries.6, 14, 15, 16 The G3 type of equine rotavirus has two associated subtypes: G3A and G3B.",

In a retrospective study of foals with diarrhea presented to the University of Florida, rotavirus was the most frequently detected infectious agent (20% of cases).20 Equine rotaviruses only cause clinical disease in foals and are considered primarily species specific; for example, cattle rotavirus affects cattle and not horses or humans. However, a recent report suggested that an unusual equine strain (H-1) may have originated from a porcine rotavirus strain that was transmitted to horses because at least 9 of 11 of its gene segments were found to be of porcine virus origin.21 No natural reservoir for equine rotavirus has been identified. Mares may shed the virus subclinically, although this is transient and not considered to be as significant in magnitude as from diarrheic foals.22 Considering the large concentrations of virus shed into the environment (1011 particles/g feces) by diarrheic animals, as well as the ability of the virus to remain viable for as long as 9 months,23 the potential for an outbreak after the first clinical case is very real.",

The loss of these epithelial cells results in the absence of disaccharidases, especially lactase, causing transient lactose intolerance and a hyperosmotic solution in the intestinal lumen. This leads to malabsorption and maldigestion of nutrients and acute diarrhea. Intestinal crypt cells are not affected as they are in canine parvovirus infection. Therefore crypt cells continue to replicate, differentiate, and eventually replace the tip cells destroyed by the virus, resulting in a self-limiting disease. Chronic diarrhea (>14 days) is not typical of rotavirus infection.",

The vaccine contains an inactivated strain of a G3 equine rotavirus serotype (H2 strain or G3P[12]) in a metabolizable oil-in-water adjuvant.11 This vaccine is administered intramuscularly to pregnant mares at 8, 9, and 10 months of gestation to heighten colostral immunity. Each pregnancy requires revaccination with 3 doses. This vaccine has been utilized extensively in equine intensive locales in central Kentucky, Florida, Newmarket in the United Kingdom (UK), and other major breeding centers in the United States, UK, and Ireland. Antirotaviral antibodies are concentrated in colostrum and absorbed by suckling foals.11, 12 In one study, foals of 100 vaccinated and 65 unvaccinated mares were studied. Vaccinated mares had received an inactivated rotavirus (G3P2, G3P12, and G6P1) vaccine at 9 and 10 months of gestation. The morbidity of diarrhea was 30% in foals born to vaccinated mares, in contrast to 80% in foals from unvaccinated mares. Duration of diarrhea was shorter in foals in the vaccinated mare group (1.8 days versus 7.3 days). Importantly, there was 0% shedding detected in the diarrheic foals born to vaccinated mares, as opposed to 80% shedding in the diarrheic foals of unvaccinated mares.45 In a second study of 627 mares over 2 years, the vaccine was administered at 8, 9, and 10 months of gestation in a randomized controlled trial. The vaccine was determined to be safe, and antibody titers were significantly higher in foals born to vaccinated mares for up to 90 days postpartum. The incidence of rotaviral diarrhea was decreased in the foals of the study group as compared to controls; however, this was not statistically different. Although beneficial, vaccination should be considered an adjunctive to farm hygiene and meticulous husbandry practices, rather than a replacement for them.",

The subfamily Coronavirinae contains three genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. Equine coronavirus is a Betacoronavirus similar to human coronavirus OC43, human enteric coronavirus, bovine coronavirus, and canine respiratory coronavirus.53 The coronaviruses were so named because the unusually large, club-shaped peplomers projecting from the envelope give the viral particle the appearance of a solar corona.50, 52, 54 The tubular nucleocapsid is composed of a phosphorylated nucleoprotein and appears to be connected directly to a transmembrane protein, M, which spans the lipid bilayer three times. Only a small fraction of its mass is exposed to the external environment.50, 52, 54, 55 Two types of prominent spikes line the outside of the virion. The long spikes, which consist of the S (spike) glycoprotein, are present on all coronaviruses and give them their characteristic \u201ccorona\u201d appearance. The short spikes, which consist of the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein, are present in only some coronaviruses.50, 52, 53, 55 The other subfamily under family Coronaviridae is Torovirinae, and within that family is the genus Torovirus. Toroviruses are established agents of gastroenteritis in animals, and the type species of the genus is Berne virus (BEV), a chance isolate from a diarrheic horse in 1972.51, 55, 56, 57, 58 Torovirus is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.",

Virus replication in vivo can be either disseminated, causing systemic infections, or restricted to a few cell types, often the epithelial cells of the respiratory or enteric tract and macrophages, causing localized infections. Coronavirus replication takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells.52 Like rotavirus, coronavirus causes damage to the villi of the intestinal mucosa, resulting in loss of absorptive capacity, leading to a malabsorptive diarrhea. The course of disease is typically initiated in the proximal small intestine.",

Serum antibody titers to coronavirus were evaluated by serum neutralization (SN) test using bovine coronavirus (BCV), which is closely related antigenically to ECoV.53, 61, 62 Two horses were seropositive for BCV 1 month before transportation (titers 10 and 40). These horses were transported in the same vehicle as four horses that were seronegative to coronavirus. The four seronegative horses seroconverted after transportation (titers between 10 and 20 within 1 month), but none developed clinical signs, and a direct relationship between disease and coronavirus infection could not be confirmed.61 This study suggested that ECoV could possibly spread among horses while they are stabled together or during transport, although this requires confirmation. This hypothesis is consistent with serologic evidence that BCV or its related virus is widely prevalent in horses in Japan.61, 62\n",

Seven percent (7/96) of clinically healthy horses on the premises were fecal positive.74 The most common clinical signs were anorexia (88%), lethargy (78%), and fever (73%).74 Other signs included changes in fecal character (soft-formed to watery) and colic, but these were in a minority of horses. The morbidity ranged from 20% to 57% on affected premises. Clinical signs resolved in most horses within 1 to 4 days. Approximately 6.8% of horses were euthanized because of the severity of clinical signs, including acute neurologic disease or marked endotoxemia. Common hematologic changes included leukopenia with neutropenia and/or lymphopenia. Shedding in feces generally occurred for a few days. In this report, follow-up fecal samples were available for seven horses, and PCR detection of ECoV persisted for 3-9 days.74\n",
