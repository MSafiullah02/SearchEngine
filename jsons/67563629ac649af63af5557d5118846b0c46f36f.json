SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, bioterrorism, to name a few. On the other hand, Agent-based model or Individual-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person in the computer. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epstein's model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which has not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread. In addition, a health policy game against a new type of infectious disease is designed as a serious game.",

SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse such diseases based on a mathematical model. After an outbreak of SARS, the first SIR model of SARS was published and many researchers studied the epidemic of the disease using this model. When an outbreak of a new type of influenza is first reported, the U.S. government immediately starts an emergency action plan to estimate parameters of its SIR model. Nevertheless the SIR model has difficulty to analyse which measures are effective because the model has only one parameter to represent infectiveness. For example, it is difficult for the SIR model to evaluate the effect of temporary closing of classes because of the influenza epidemic. The agent-based approach or the individual-based approach has been adopted to conquer these problems in recent years [1] [2] [3] [4] . The model enables to represent behaviour of each person. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model.",

What we want to know is how to prevent an epidemic of infectious diseases not only using mechanisms of the epidemic but also decision making of health policy [5] . Most Importantly, we should make a decision in our modern society where people are on the move frequently world wide, so we can minimise the economic and human loss caused by the epidemic. Therefore we developed a new serious game in which authorities of areas or countries need to make a prompt decision regarding health policies such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff in order to achieve effective control measures. In the game, decision-makers need to focus on many kinds of policy variables and control them in an appropriate manner to minimise human loss. Policies have inevitable costs to operate them. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to control an epidemic in a single country in the modern world; therefore cooperation between countries is tantamount. We developed a health policy game designed as a serious game against a new type of infectious disease. Through this game, we aim to analyse how complex decision-making of policies are, and confirm the effectiveness as an educational tool of policy decision-making.",

The incubation period is normally 7 days, and then the person gets infected after showing the symptoms. The symptoms in the early stage are similar to influenza. They are fever, a headache, muscular pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a stomachache. The fatality rate is very high; 50-90 %. There is no effective medical treatment medicine confirmed officially and several medicines are currently being tested. According to a guideline of WHO, the serum of a recovered patient is one of most effective treatments. Epstein [6] [7] made a smallpox model based on 49 epidemics in Europe from 1950 to 1971. In the model, 100 families from two towns were surveyed. The family includes two parents and two children thus the population is each 400 from each town. All parents go to work in their town during the day except 10 per cent of adults who go to another town. All children attend school. There is a communal hospital serving the two towns in which each 5 people from each town work. This model was designed as an agent-based model, and then simulation of infectious disease was conducted using the model. As results of experiments showed that 1) in a base model in which any infectious disease measures were not taken, the epidemic spread within 82 days and 30 per cent of people died, 2) a trace vaccination measure was effective but it was difficult to trace all contacts to patients in an underground railway or an airport, 3) a mass vaccination measure was effective, but the number of vaccinations would be huge so it was not realistic, 4) epidemic quenching was also effective, and reactive household trace vaccination along with pre-emptive vaccination of hospital workers showed a dramatic effect. Ohkusa [8] evaluated smallpox measures using an individual-based model of infectious diseases. The model supposed a town including 10,000 habitants and a public health centre. In the model, one person was infected with smallpox virus at a shopping mall. They compared between a trace vaccination measure and a mass vaccination measure. As a result of simulation, it was found that the effect of trace vaccination dropped if the early stage of infection was high and the number of medical staff is small, while the effect of mass vaccination was stable. Therefore timely and concentrate mass vaccination is required when virus starts spreading. The estimation about the number, place and time of infection is needed quickly and the preparation of an emergency medical treatment and estimation system is required for such occasions.",

As health policies, vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of vaccinations per day by medical staff, mass vaccination, and trace vaccination are implemented in the model. As a result of experiments, it has been found that vaccination availability per day and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread for the mass vaccination strategy. On the other hand, small quantities of vaccination for approximately 10 per cent of inhabitants are vaccinated per day are able to control an epidemic in most cases. In the case of using a public transportation to commute, however, even if half of inhabitants were vaccinated per day, it would not prevent the epidemic. Two thirds of vaccinations per day are required each day to prevent the epidemic.",
