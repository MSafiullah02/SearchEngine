The experts specialized in methodology provided training on standardized literature search and grading of evidence to all the specialists contributing to the guideline. Level of evidence and grading of recommendation were based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) guidelines for CAP (2007).1 The level of evidence represents the assessment on the quality of study evidence, and the grading of recommendation refers to the assessment on the degree to which the benefits of an intervention outweighs the risks. Generally speaking, the higher the evidence level, the stronger the grade of recommendation, but they do not fully correspond to each other. The willingness and values of patients, as well as resource consumption should also be considered when making a recommendation (Table 1).",

However, it is important to note that a correct diagnosis is a prerequisite. Physicians should not ignore necessary differential diagnosis for the purpose of early diagnosis117, 118, 119, 120 (II B).For mild CAP outpatients, oral anti\u2010infective agents with high bioavailability should be used when possible. Oral treatment with amoxicillin or amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid is recommended2, 121, 122 (I B). For young patients without underlying diseases, oral doxycycline or minocycline may be considered if suspected of mycoplasma or chlamydia infection1, 123 (III B). S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are highly resistant to macrolides in China.28, 36 Empirical macrolides treatment can only be used in regions with lower resistance rates122 (II B). Respiratory quinolones can be used instead in regions with higher resistance rates to macrolides or in patients who are hypersensitive or intolerant to the drugs mentioned above121, 122, 124 (II B).For CAP patients who require hospitalization, \u03b2\u2010lactams monotherapy or in combination with doxycycline, minocycline or macrolides and respiratory quinolones monotherapy are recommended2, 125, 126, 127 (II B). However, compared with combination therapies, respiratory quinolones monotherapy is associated with fewer adverse reactions,128 and no skin test is required.For young adult patients with severe CAP and without underlying diseases who require admission to ICU, penicillins\u2010lactamase inhibitor combinations, third generation cephalosporins, ertapenem combined with macrolides or respiratory quinolones monotherapy are recommended.1, 2, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132 For the elderly patients or patients with underlying diseases, combination antimicrobial therapy is recommended133 (II B).For CAP patients at risk of aspiration, the optimal selection should be drugs with anti\u2010anaerobic activity, such as ampicillin\u2010sulbactam, amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid, moxifloxacin, carbapenems and so on, or therapies in combination with metronidazole, clindamycin and so on 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141 (II A).For hospitalized patients \u2265 65 years of age and with underlying diseases (eg, congestive heart failure, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic respiratory system diseases, kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, etc.), the possibility of Enterobacteriaceae infection should be considered.24 Such patients should be further evaluated for the risk of infections with extended\u2010spectrum beta\u2010lactamases (ESBLs) \u2010producing bacteria (eg, history of colonization or infection with ESBLs\u2010producing bacteria, prior use of third generation cephalosporins, history of repeated or long\u2010term hospitalization, indwelling implants, renal replacement therapies).142, 143, 144 Cephamycins,145, 146 piperacillin\u2010tazobactam, cefoperazone\u2010sulbactam or ertapenem can be used in empirical therapy for high\u2010risk patients 24, 147 (III B).During influenza seasons, CAP patients with suspected influenza virus infection are recommended to receive regular influenza virus antigen test or nucleic acid assay. Proactive antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors should be administered simultaneously even 48 h after disease onset. It is not necessary to wait for the results of influenza pathogen tests148, 149, 150, 151, 152 (I A). During influenza seasons, physicians must be aware of the possibility of secondary bacterial infections, especially S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and H. influenzae, which are relatively common153, 154, 155 (II A).Anti\u2010infective therapy can usually be terminated 2\u20133 days after fever is relieved and the primary respiratory tract symptoms are improved significantly. However, the duration of therapy should differ based on the severity of disease, treatment response, complications and pathogens. It is not necessary to use chest X\u2010ray or CT as an indication of termination of anti\u2010bacterial agents. Generally, the duration of therapy should be 5\u20137 days for patients with mild or moderate CAP, which could be reasonably prolonged for patients with severe CAP or with extra\u2010pulmonary complications. The duration of therapy can be prolonged to 10\u201314 days for patients with atypical pathogens and/or slow response to treatment. S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella and anaerobic bacteria may cause necrosis of lung tissues, therefore, the duration of therapy may be prolonged to 14\u201321 days1, 2, 122, 156, 157, 158, 159 (I B).\n",

Additionally, for patients with risk of hypercapnia, oxygen saturation should be maintained at 88%\u201092% before obtaining the results of blood gas analysis173, 174 (III A). The results of recent studies showed that heated and humidified high\u2010flow oxygen therapy via nasal catheter (40\u201360 L/min) could also be used in clinical practice175, 176 (II B).Compared with high\u2010concentration oxygen therapy, non\u2010invasive ventilation (NIV, including bilevel positive airway pressure or continuous positive pressure ventilation) can decrease the endotracheal intubation rate and mortality of CAP patients with acute respiratory failure,177, 178, 179, 180, 181 improve oxygenation index faster and more significantly,177, 178, 182, 183 and decrease the incidence of multiple organ failure,179 and septic shock.177 These benefits are more significant for patients with concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease180 (II B). However, for CAP patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), NIV has shown high failure rate184 and it cannot improve prognosis.177 NIV is also not appropriate for CAP patients with severe hypoxemia (oxygenation index < 150 mm Hg)184 (II A).Additionally, the failure of NIV must be recognized timely. NIV failure is indicated if NIV cannot improve respiratory rate or oxygenation state within the initial 1\u20132 h,180, 184, 185 or the therapy cannot decrease the blood carbon dioxide level in a patient with initial hypercapnia.180 The oxygen therapy should be switched to tracheal intubation and ventilator\u2010assisted ventilation immediately (II A).Mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg ideal body weight) should be used for CAP patients with ARDS after tracheal intubation186, 187 (I A).For patients with severe CAP and concomitant ARDS, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used if regular mechanical ventilation cannot lead to improvement188, 189, 190, 191 (II B). Indications of ECMO include: (1) reversible respiratory failure associated with severe hypoxemia (oxygenation index < 80 mm Hg or hypoxemia that cannot be corrected even after 6 h high\u2010level positive end\u2010expiratory pressure [PEEP] assisted\u2010ventilation); (2) serious decompensatory acidosis (pH < 7.15); (3) excessively high plateau pressure (eg, > 35\u201345 cm H2O).192\n\n",
