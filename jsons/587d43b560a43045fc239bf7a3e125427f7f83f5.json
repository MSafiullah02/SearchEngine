Several factors are behind this decline: For one thing, countries like China are shifting toward renewable energy, seriously affecting supply-demand globally. On the supply side, there has been overproduction partly due to expansion of shale gas and tar sands. The biggest factor, however, is in consumer preferences for energy efficient technologies, not only in car manufacture, but in other fields of energy. Coal and all types of \"dirty fuel\" are in disfavour and can be expected to become increasingly so in future. In the stock market, renewable shares are outpacing fossil fuels. We expect this trend will accelerate globally and take hold in the East Mediterranean region as well. While hydrocarbon prices may remain steady or decline, as demand shifts to solar, wind and water energy sources, prices of renewable technology and equipment will continue to fall. More competitive relative prices will encourage more industries, as well as homes, cities, and car users will join the trend for a Greener World.",

That does not mean that these hydrocarbons are not valuable or that there are no significant alternatives. To be sure, there are indeed significant alternatives, dictated by Location Theory which favours short-distance monetization over distant markets. Our most likely scenario is that most of the East Med hydrocarbon will be marketed within the region, notably in Turkey, by far the largest economy in the region and energy hungry. Also, Energy cooperation is likely to expand between Israel, Egypt and Jordan spurred on by market forces. Cooperation between Israel and Turkey is the key, as we see it. At the same time Israel-Arab energy links will expand led by Egypt-Israel energy cooperation. This parallels Greek-Turkish-Azeri cooperation over TANAP-TAP and Russian-Turkish cooperation over TurkStream. Our future scenario is a set of expanding concentric circles of countries in the region, each circle representing higher level of cooperation with new partners, always pursuing the least-cost marketing option consistent with rational choice. In future, depending on new discoveries, any exportable hydrocarbons from Israeli, Cypriot and Iraqi fields will be traded in regional and international markets, in accordance with market forces of supply and demand. In the end, we believe an increasingly firm Model of Regional Energy Cooperation will emerge, expanding in tandem with market dynamics.",

As non-Arab states in the Middle East, Turkey and Israel are natural allies. They are the most democratic in the region. In recent years, bilateral relations have been far from perfect. However, looking ahead, we share the vision in Shira Efron's recent study (The Future of Israeli-Turkish Relations RAND Corporation, see Efron et al. 2019 ). This short, but comprehensive study of the bilateral relations, especially from an Israeli perspective at the beginning of 1918, is useful as a pragmatic guide. The book covers the Palestinian conflict, the civil war in Syria, relations with Iran, the Kurdish issue and Israel's new ties with Greece and Cyprus. Efron et al., argues that Israel and Turkey share many common interests and he correctly asserts that Israel depends on Turkey to contain Iranian influence in the region. Beyond that, there are deep economic interests driving both sides toward 'pragmatic' decision-making. Energy cooperation is one such key area. Not surprisingly, the most recently the Israeli press is reporting that Turkish energy company Turcas Petrol and another Turkish company Enerjisa, together with the German utility E.ON, are negotiating to buy large quantities of natural gas from Israel's Leviathan field (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/ .premium-turkish-firms-want-israeli-gas-1.5245955).",

The long Turkish seacoast, continental shelf and a large energy import capacity also confer significant comparative advantage, in particular economies of scale in terms of transportation and pipeline delivery. Increasingly, Turkey will act as the magnet in future development of the East Mediterranean hydrocarbons. Market forces favour this role (http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ eastern-mediterranean-gas-why-turkey-is-key-to-its-success-148668. Accessed on 14/9/2019). According to Bloomberg, cited in this source, the gas price will decline to USD 2.60/MBtu by 2022, owing to cheap shale gas discovery in the USA and elsewhere. Competitively priced natural gas will flow to Turkey from several sources. In the Caspian Sea Basin east of Turkey lie major gas fields in Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. TANAP may well be extended into these gas fields, once they go into production. Across the Black Sea, the TurkStream project, consisting of two 930-km lines each with a capacity of 15.75 billion cubic meters, crossing under the Black Sea, entered in production in January 2020. It will deliver Russian gas to Turkish consumers initially, and then to supply gas to south and south eastern Europe (http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ankara-to-complete-turkstream-byend-of-2019-148818. Accessed on 18/11/2019). These market developments reinforce our conclusion that the most efficient option for any Eastern Mediterranean gas export market is the energy hungry Turkish market.

Hydrocarbon and pipeline politics will likewise feature prominently in this regional approach to Syrian peace. The oil and gas fields of Northern Iraq would empower KRG relative to Baghdad and energy geopolitics will forge closer relations with Ankara. The landlocked KRG needs to export its hydrocarbons through the Turkish hub at Iskenderun. This closer relationship, with expanded trade, investment and energy cooperation, will incorporate phasing out of the PKK-PYD terrorism matched by greater ethnic rights for peaceful Kurds in the area.

Israeli firms continue to have significant stakes in energy cooperation with Turkey.",

Syria and Lebanon face serious domestic challenges as well. None of the regional powers are likely to endorse Greek/Greek Cypriot plans to exclude Turkey in regional energy development. Exclusion will not work, sharing and cooperation will.",

That day may not be realized in the immediate short-term, but we believe it has a good chance of realization within the next decade, or when zero-emission cars will become the norm in a greener world. Then, consumer choice will be the ultimate determinant of balancing price, affordability and security of supplies, as well as which kinds of energy will be chosen to heat houses, drive cars and fuel industry. The balance between renewable energy and fossil fuels will be determined by market forces guided by rational behaviour. The challenge for the East Mediterranean hydrocarbon actors will be how much they will adapt to market dynamics and how much weight they will place on emotional or irrational politics.",

            "text": "Turkish-Russian energy cooperation, and the broader geopolitical relations, are vital and, we expect, will survive the military confrontation which erupted in Idlib at the end of February 2020 when the Assad forces, backed by Russia, attacked and killed 34 Turkish soldiers. Despite the Astana Agreement, Moscow and Ankara suddenly found themselves in opposite camps in this confrontation. The brutal offensive in Idlib by the Assad regime, supported by Russian jets, has displaced another one million Syrians in this 'de-escalation zone', adding to the humanitarian burden of Ankara. Turkey is already hosting almost 4 million Syrian refugees, having spent so far over $40bn while EU's commitment of aid has not even reached 50% of the original pledge under the 2016 Accord. This deal is in urgent need of updating as the new exodus of migrants threaten peace on the Greek-Turkish border. Parallel differences between Turkey and Russia have emerged in the fight in Libya as well, between the GNA and Haftar forces. Through dialogue and compromise, we believe Presidents Putin and Erdogan can re-balance Turkish-Russian relations in these conflicts, but how such rebalancing will also affect Ankara's NATO relations remains to be seen. The Putin-Erdogan meeting in Moscow on 5 March 2020 was constructive leading to a ceasefire in Idlib. Libya was also discussed. The ceasefire deal effectively creates a Safe Zone north of M4 highway and Idlib city for resettling Syrian refugees in their own homeland, a practical step to a sustainable peace in Syria. The cost of resettling Syrian refugees remains as a huge burden, well beyond Turkish capability. One the positive, further cooperation between Erdogan and Putin could now pave the way toward restoration of Syrian peace, possibly even in Libya. That, in turn, would enhance regional cooperation, including in energy as detailed in this book.",

            "text": "As this book was at press, the COVID-19 Pandemic broke out, the first epicenter in Wuhan, China, subsequently in Europe and then in the United States. Lockdowns, social distancing and sudden restrictions on social and economic activity, including freezing of air travel and world trade, have pushed the global economy into a deep and unprecedented recession. Governments have been obliged to inject huge amounts of liquidity into markets. The UN Secretary General has called for a ceasefire on all existing conflicts. In the middle of this Pandemic, the Saudi-Arabia and Russia rivalry in oil production plummeted prices to around $20 per barrel. How these challenges will play out globally, and as far as the Eastern Mediterranean energy prospects are concerned, is uncertain at this stage (mid-April 2020). We believe that our analysis and conclusions remain valid. Indeed, our model of a Regional Energy Cooperation is now even more relevant. As well, the pace of Energy Transformation to a Green World, cleaner, and safer may also quicken.",
