            "text": "COVID-19 is caused by a virus belonging to the Coronaviridae (CoV) family, which are typically harboured in mammals and other animals. Coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infect unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumonocytes, which in turn causes fever, cough, shortness of breath and severe complications like pneumonia (Ashour et al., 2020) . These are typical characteristics of all common influenzas. Over the past 8 weeks, many professional bodies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have provided specific recommendations regarding COVID-19 and pregnant women. The limited data cannot support the notion that pregnant women are a group with higher risk of illness, since there are reports where women positive to SARS-CoV-2 delivered healthy infants (in Greece there are currently three cases). This could be an indication against the intrauterine transmission of the virus. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence pointing to the possible transmission from positive SARS-CoV-2 mothers to newborns and this, together with the presence of antibodies in an infant born to a positive SARS-CoV-2 mother (Dong et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) , places pregnant women in the group with higher risk of illness.",

In brief, they recommend cancelling fertility treatments, although this may lead to additional stress for couples who badly want to have a child, especially in poor responders. Moreover, they recommend suspending initiation of new treatments and an alternative freeze-all protocol in cases where couples have already undergone HCG triggering. Cryopreservation of gametes should be considered for cases of urgent fertility preservation. At this time, almost all fertility centers have cancelled fertility treatments (La Marca et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Wallberg and Wikander, 2020) although the association between SARS-CoV-2 and pregnancy resulting from ART treatments has several uncertainties. The impact of the virus in the very early stages of embryo development, i.e. from fertilization to blastocyst and from implantation to the first trimester, is not known. Evidence-based information regarding the pregnancy outcome, including miscarriage and live birth rates, of women positive for the SARS-CoV-2 would be useful tools for creating guidelines but may never exist in assisted reproduction. Although the decision to discontinue all medical procedures related to infertility treatment was not evidence-based, the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 has created a unique challenge in global healthcare systems, cancelling the fertility treatments will not only stop the spread of the virus but will support these systems by avoiding additional stress contribution.",

            "text": "To date, in the news and statements on the ESHRE website it has been announced that the probability of contamination of the gametes or embryos by SARS-CoV-2 is limited, since washing steps, culture and freezing protocols appear to reduce the potentially transmitted viral load, but may not eliminate it. The possible absence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in gametes (spermatozoa, oocytes) and embryos would strongly support this assumption, while the presence of zona pellucida in the oocytes and embryos up to the sixth day of development cannot argue in favour of the notion that the virus may impact negatively during IVF treatments. It is not uncommon healthcare professionals to advise couples to postpone fertility treatment when either the husband or the wife have symptoms of or have recently recovered any of the common flus. The reason is obvious, since any kind of flu (such as the Zika virus) may cause infertility (Barzon et al., 2017) . From recent global experience, SARS-CoV-2 seems to be far more aggressive regarding severe illness, morbidity or mortality in comparison to common flus. At the cellular level, common influenza viruses promote oxidant-sensitive pathways, leading to the activation of pathogenic mechanisms that the oxidative stress may cause (Khomich et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017) . Increased oxidative stress has been blamed for male infertility (Agarwal et al., 2018; Bisht et al., 2017; Dutta et al., 2019) through the reduction of sperm progressive motility and the simultaneous increase of sperm DNA fragmentation (Dorostghoal et al., 2017; Homa et al., 2019) .",

ACE2 receptors have been recently observed in human Leydig cells (Wang and Xu, 2020) implying a possible direct effect of the virus on male reproductive system. Nevertheless, two recent reports suggest that the virus was not present in the semen of patients who recently recovered from COVID-19 (Pan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020) . A recent study has shown that testicular ACE seems to be crucial for the early stages of embryo development (Gianzo et al., 2018) since ACE has been found to play significant role in sperm functions (Kohn et al., 1998) . In addition, ACE has been proposed to be responsible for either reduced or total fertilization failure during conventional IVF (Kondoh et al., 2005; Li et al., 2014) . As far as the oocyte is concerned, the role of ACE has been underlined some time ago (Pan et al., 2014) , while this enzyme is present in preovulatory follicles, at least in rats (Homorato-Sampaio et al., 2012) . ACE2 receptors have been found to be expressed in human ovaries (Reis et al., 2011) , while angiotensin-(1-7) has been detected in measurable amounts in the follicular fluid. Therefore, a possible negative impact of the virus through an interaction between the oocyte and the somatic cells cannot be ruled out. As far as embryos is concerned, it has been found that human germ cells and early embryos express high levels of ACE2 (Yan et al., 2013) , while recently it was noticed that ACE2 was enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection . Taking all these together, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 directly on sperm or follicles/oocytes maybe a fact, but more molecular or cellular experiments are needed to prove this speculation.",

First of all, an area in the laboratory separate of the usual is needed. The use of physical barriers, such as glass windows, can be implemented in screening areas or in the registration desk areas of the fertility clinics as well as in the embryology laboratory in order to prevent the exposure of spaces and staff to the COVID-19",

Alternatively, the already in-use compartments of the clinics (oocyte recovery rooms, sperm recovery rooms ect) should be cleaned and disinfected after every case with specific products. All staff should be trained on specific protocols dealing with SARS-CoV-2 cases and wearing specific filtering face masks. Where physical presence is not necessary, the use of telemedicine for any fertility inquiries, including embryological results, will minimize the spread of the virus. The usual work uniform is believed to be replaced by a similar or even identical SARS-CoV-2 work uniformFor instance, protective coverall shoes, or isolation clothing in a combination with a head cover. Thus, a physical barrier that will protect the body from any possible contamination will be formed. Gloves and facial masks should continue to be used but on a single-use manner in every case (not only in positive but also in asymptomatic patients). Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including mask respirators for healthcare workers (HCWs) of fertility clinics are likely to be added to the daily work. In case of clinics with many stimulation cycles it will be wise to restrict the number of the staff which come in close contact with COVID-19 patients. The contamination of the embryology laboratory seems to be realistic, despite the negative pressure that exists inside the laboratories. The fact that the virus can survive for several hours in the air and at temperature above 22 0 C (normal temperature in most laboratories), can be easily speculated that contamination of the incubators may occur. SARS-CoV-2 seems not to follow seasonal patterns, as seen in most outbreaks and therefore in temperatures more than 25 0 C the virus may still have the ability to contaminate. Therefore, it might be useful to reevaluate the laboratory temperature and the pressure, so as to reassure that the virus is not in the air or does not have any chance to survive. Separate from the other non-COVID-19 patient's incubators may be used to avoid any potential cross-contamination. It has been found that SARS-CoV-2 may retain its contamination on plastics for about 72 hours (van Doremalen et al., 2020; Kampf et al., 2020) and that makes the non-embryotoxic dishes not free of the virus. It is possible that in the coming years the quality control of culture dishes will include SARS-CoV-2 free sheets that will assure that exposable dishes and all relative equipment are free of the virus. Additionally, although not yet tested for its resistance in cooling rates during vitrification, the resistance of other viruses to cryogenic (LN) temperatures has been proposed a time ago (Merrill et al., 2018) . Due to the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other common viruses, it would be a safe action to have separate LN cryostorage containers for SARS-CoV-2 positive women. Moreover, another separate but vapor cryostorage tank for positive COVID-19 sperm samples could be a good choice. In a similar way, a declaration about the SARS-CoV-2 test will be necessity for all donors. Ail liquids should be tested for the virus and all suppliers should submit a statement that the ingredients are free of the virus.",

In the next few years, we may experience reduced fertilization, implantation and live birth rates, while at the same time novel challenges will arise for the embryology laboratory to carry out delicate procedures in order to neutralize any virus present.",

All measures are in line with the recommendations provided by WHO. Scientific societies, such as ESHRE and ASRM, have provided recommendations and guidance to overcome and flatten the growing curve of infection in patients that undergo IVF treatments. Although there is no evidence yet that the virus causing COVID-19 may exert negative effects on IVF outcome, fertility treatments have been postponed in order to support the healthcare systems by avoiding additional stress contribution. The possibility of the virus affecting sperm function and egg performance cannot be excluded. Also, an indirect effect of the virus on gametes and embryos during their manipulation cannot be ruled out. This commentary aims to provide some ideas on the possible effect of the virus on gametes and embryos as well as how it can affect the normal functioning of the embryology laboratory. At the time of writing, citizens of about 200 countries have been infected by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.",
