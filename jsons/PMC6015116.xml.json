A diagnosis of proven IPA requires histopathological evidence of fungal invasion. For a diagnosis of putative IPA, a patient had a positive culture for Aspergillus spp. from any lower respiratory tract (LRT) sample, together with meeting three criteria: (1) compatible signs and symptoms, (2) any abnormality on medical imaging and (3) either a positive semi-quantitative Aspergillus culture from BAL without bacterial growth and a positive cytological smear showing branching hyphae or any of the host risk factor for IPA according to EORTC/MSG criteria [19].

Cox regression analysis found mortality was over three times higher in patients with putative IPA compared with that of patients with either colonisation or patients with no evidence of Aspergillus spp. (p = 0.036) (Fig. 2, Table 3). Additionally, both age and length of mechanical ventilation prior to vv-ECMO were also found to be associated with an increased risk of death.

Many of these trials did not differentiate between Aspergillus infection and colonisation and include patients receiving both vv-ECMO and veno-arterial ECMO as a combined category [7, 24], making true comparison difficult. Aubron et al. [11] described 11 patients from 151 receiving ECMO support with Aspergillus disease but just 2 (18%) patients were supported with vv-ECMO. Hospital-acquired Aspergillus infection is very unlikely as environmental screening demonstrated an acceptable number of environmental Aspergillus conidia with no evidence of excessive fungal contamination. Our study has identified immunosuppression and influenza A infection as independent risk factors for IPA. Thus, the high incidence of Aspergillus infection in our patients may be related to the high rate of patients with influenza A.",

The multivariate Cox regression model, which incorporated risk factors known to be associated with excess mortality in patients receiving vv-ECMO, demonstrated a three times greater hazard of death in patients with putative IPA compared to non-Aspergillus group.
