Since then, EV-D68 has emerged as a notable pathogen, causing clusters of respiratory illness in Asia, Europe, and the United States [5\u20138]. The United States National Enterovirus Surveillance System reported 79 cases of EV-D68 from 2009 to 2013, over double the number it reported in the prior three decades [9].",

The pediatric population appears to be disproportionately affected and the virus can be associated with severe respiratory disease in children [5, 7, 11]. During an outbreak in the United States in 2009, over half of EV-D68 cases detected in children affected those less than four years of age, and 54% resulted in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission [5]. Similarly, a Japanese case series noted that a disproportionate number of pediatric EV-D68 patients presented with an asthma attack that was classified as severe (43.2%) compared to children admitted to the same hospital for asthma exacerbations of other etiologies, in whom only 14.3% were classified as severe [11].",

Surveillance data revealed that affected individuals presented with symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness and that children with preexisting asthma were particularly at risk [9, 12, 13]. Despite its increasing prevalence over the past decade, the characteristics of this virus, including the epidemiology and spectrum of illness, are not yet well described [14]. The current study seeks to characterize cases of EV-D68 admitted to British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) from September to December of 2014. We describe the patient demographics, clinical presentation, management at our institution, and underlying characteristics that may predispose patients to more severe clinical presentations.",

Reports from previous EV-D68 outbreaks found that children 0\u20134 years of age were the most likely to be hospitalized [5, 7]. However, during the 2014 outbreak, it appears that school aged children were disproportionately affected, which is consistent with findings from other studies [13, 17]. In addition, studies from the 2014 outbreak that have compared patients with EV-D68 to non-EV-D68 patients found that cases with EV-D68 were older [13, 17]. Of note, there were only two cases of EV-D68 in infants less than one year at our institution, and both were excluded from this study as they had primarily nonrespiratory presentations. Given that 37% of nasopharyngeal testing in our study was done in the age group of 0-1 year, this finding points to a lower rate of exposure or less severe clinical presentation in infants.",

A high rate of copathogen presence has also been observed in prior EV-D68 outbreaks [22, 23]. Whilst potentially pathogenic bacteria can colonize the nasopharynx without causing disease, there is some evidence that bacterial colonization may have a role in recurrent wheezing episodes either independently or as a cofactor to viral infection [24, 25]. A recent meta-analysis did not reveal any difference in clinical disease severity between children with viral coinfections and those with a single pathogen [26].
