Many medicinally important apiaceous plants (almost 250 species) have been used for centuries in folk medicine in the treatment of various ailments.\n[3]\n These plants provide us with many potentially active compounds from all classes of secondary metabolites, including essential oils, phenolics (flavonoids, coumarins and lignans), triterpene saponins, alkaloids and polyacetylenes. These bioactive metabolites can serve as lead compounds in the treatment of many serious diseases.\n[4]\n\n",

The flowers are bisexual, yellowish or rarely purplish with five stamens and the fruits occur mostly as cremocarps. Leaves are simple, long, slender and alternate with entire margin. The genus is represented by 180\u2013190 species, which are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere and commonly used in Eurasia and North Africa for their medicinal properties.\n[2]\n Embedded in Asian traditional medicine, several Bupleurum species have been used either alone or in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of common cold, inflammatory disorders, hepatitis, cancer and fever in the form of over\u2010the\u2010counter herbal teas or in different pharmaceutical preparations.[\n6\n, \n7\n]Bupleurum species are officially listed in the Chinese and Japanese Pharmacopoeias in addition to the WHO monographs of the commonly used medicinal plants of China and Korea.[\n8\n, \n9\n] However, none of the Bupleurum plants were selected by the German Commission E, the British Pharmacopoeia 2009 or the British National Formulary 57.\n[10]\n\n",

Many Bupleuri extracts have been used for improvement and protection against chronic hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome and autoimmune diseases.\n[12]\n Other uses include improvement of cholecystitis and wound healing and treatment of deafness, dizziness, vomiting, dry throat and diabetes. However, these effects are not supported by experimental or clinical data. Moreover, combinations of Bupleurum with ginseng and Astragalus are used against haemorrhoids, anal or uterine complications and diarrhoea.[\n8\n, \n9\n, \n12\n]",

About 200 components of essential oils from 20 species have been documented. Li and coworkers[\n13\n, \n14\n] examined the compositions of the essential oils obtained from the roots of 10 different species from China and they were found to consist mainly of a series of aliphatic aldehydes and acids, such as hexanal, heptanal (E)\u20102\u2010nonenal (E,E)\u20102,4\u2010decadienal, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid. These aldehydes are characteristic of the Chinese species. This was confirmed by our work on B. marginatum in which \u03b2\u2010caryophyllene, \u03b2\u2010caryophyllene oxide and spathulenol, in addition to the aforementioned aldehydes, represent the major components of the oil.\n[15]\n In contrast, essential oils from European species are characterized by the presence of a high abundance of \u03b1/\u03b2\u2010pinene, limonene and 1,8\u2010cineole rather than aliphatic aldehydes. This difference can be used to distinguish between oils from Italy or Spain and those from China.[\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n]",

To date, more than 120 glycosylated oleanane\u2010type and ursane\u2010type saponins have been isolated from Bupleurum species.[\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n] The aglycones of these saikosaponins are closely related oxygenated pentacyclic triterpenoidal structures that can be distinguished only by the positions and numbers of the double bonds in rings C and D and oxygenation patterns in positions 16, 23, 28 and 30 (Figure 1). These saponins generally bear one (monodesmosidic) or, less often, two (bidesmosidic) carbohydrate chains that are directly attached to the hydroxyl groups in position 3 for monodesmosidic saponins and to positions 3 and 28 or 30 in the case of the bidesmosidic saponins. The according carbohydrate chains are composed mainly of fucose, rhamnose, xylose, galacatose and glucose moieties. Generally, the bidesmosides are stored in plant vacuoles and are considered prodrugs. They are hydrolysed by the metabolizing enzymes when the plant is wounded to give the monodesmosides, which are the pharmacologically active forms.\n[24]\n Saikosaponins with the aglycone structure I represent the most abundant triterpene saponins found in Bupleurum species.\n[25]\n Of these, saikosaponins A, C and D, which had been isolated for the first time from B. falcatum roots, constitute the most common saponins in such species as B. kunmingense, B. marginatum and B. wenchuanense.[\n10\n, \n26\n] Variations in component abundance, as well as total saponin content, are commonly encountered between different plants and especially from different localities.\n[27]\n In addition, other saikosaponins with different aglycones or sugar chains have been also isolated from other Bupleurum species, as shown in the supplementary materials.[\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n] Most of these saponins are potentially active compounds and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological actions, which are discussed later.",

The maximal increase was observed with 10 \u00b5g/ml ssD, and the maximal inhibition after 8 h pre\u2010incubation with 100 \u00b5g/ml ssA. These results were confirmed in 1999 for the saikosaponins B1, B2 and D, which led to a spontaneous increase in PGE2 production in C6 rat glioma cells (IC50 15.0, 14.4 and 11.0 \u00b5\nm, respectively).\n[92]\n Surprisingly, saikosaponins A and C significantly increased the amount of inflammatory mediators after 10 min of drug administration, indicating the importance of the incubation time. To clarify the possible mode of action, the aglycone of ssD, saikogenin D, was also examined for its effect on PGE2 production and intracellular free calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) concentration in C6 rat glioma cells.\n[95]\n Saikogenin D inhibited PGE2 production in a concentration\u2010dependent manner with an IC50 value of about 3 \u00b5\nm. On the other hand, saikogenin D elevated [Ca2+]i with an EC50 value of about 35 \u00b5\nm. These results suggest that saikogenin D possesses a dual effect by inhibition of PGE2 production with an elevation of [Ca2+]I, which is attributed to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This key finding could explain the latent inhibition of PGE2 by ssD after an 8\u2010h pretreatment, which might undergo a gradual cellular hydrolysis to saikogenin D being responsible for this action.",
