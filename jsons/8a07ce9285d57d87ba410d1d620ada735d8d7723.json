Considering the severity of the clinical conditions and the Grace score (187), an urgent coronary angiography was planned in consideration of the pattern of * Giuseppe Boriani giuseppe.boriani@unimore.it high-risk non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, coupled with a favourable assessment in terms of Mini Mental Status score (27/30) and a moderate degree of frailty (score of 6 at the Clinical Frailty Scale), both in support of the decision for an invasive approach despite the advanced age. Moreover, no absolute contraindications to the angiographic study were detected. The indication to coronary angiogram and its potential risks were explained to the patients and the relatives, who consented to the procedure as well as a PCI, if indicated. At the coronary angiogram performed from the left radial artery, a severely calcified coronary tree with chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery was documented. The angiography showed also a sub-occlusion of the ostial left circumflex artery, followed by a critical stenosis to the proximal tract of the same vessel and an in-stent restenosis (> 50%) of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery ( At the end of the procedure, sinus rhythm spontaneously resumed.",

In view of the profound changes required for assisting patients with COVID-19 infection, in some regions of Italy the network of care for primary angioplasty had to be reorganized [2] . This case shows that at the time of COVID-19 pandemic, especially in regions with the highest referral of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, delivery of care for urgencies is highly conditioned by the need to rule out this harmful infection, especially in the most frail and vulnerable patients, such as the old-old. The difficulties in ruling out COVID-19 are related to the overlap between symptoms and presentation of this infection and cardiovascular diseases, including acute coronary syndromes [3, 4] . Consequently, the differential diagnosis of chest pain, with regard to coronary artery disease, which is particularly challenging in the female gender [5] is becoming even more complex in the presence of this pandemic.",

Since few evidence-based data are available for patients with advanced or very advanced age presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and a variable complexity of the clinical scenario, decision making in these patients is conditioned by a potential higher risk of complications, making much more difficult, as compared to middle age, the prediction and acceptance of the risk-benefit ratio of invasive treatments [6] . However, in very severe conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes with acute heart failure, the challenging decision to perform a coronary angiogram and a percutaneous coronary intervention may be taken even in patients close to 100 years, provided that absolute contraindications are excluded and decision making on this potentially risky option is shared with the patient and the relatives. Very limited data are available in literature on coronary angioplasty at this very advanced level of age [7, 8] , and therefore individualized decision making is advised, as done in this case of very advanced age with cognitive status maintained.",
