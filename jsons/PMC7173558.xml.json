The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are to digest and absorb ingested nutrients and to excrete waste products of digestion. Most nutrients are ingested in a form that is either too complex for absorption or insoluble and therefore indigestible or incapable of being digested. Within the GI tract, much of these substances are solubilized and further degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. This chapter describes the normal biochemical processes of intestinal secretion, digestion, and absorption. Once these issues have been put in perspective, the chapter explores the pathogenesis of the important gastrointestinal diseases of domestic animals and the biochemical basis for their diagnosis and treatment.",

Two types of secretory cells are found in the acinar portions of the salivary glands: (1) the mucous cells, which contain droplets of mucus, and (2) the serous cells, which contain multiple secretory granules. In those species that produce salivary amylase (e.g., pig and human), the secretory granules are the zymogen precursors of this enzyme. A third cell type is found lining the striated ducts. The striations along the basal borders of these cells are caused by vertical infoldings of the cell membrane, a characteristic of epithelial cells involved in rapid movement of water and electrolytes. The primary secretion of the acinar cells is modified by active transport processes of the ductal epithelium.",

As the primary fluid passes from the acinus along the duct system, the concentration of sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes changes.

The HCO\u2212\n3 then enters the venous blood by means of a Cl\u2212/HCO3\n\u2212 exchange (\u201calkaline tide\u201d), and during HCl secretion, the pH of gastric venous blood frequently is greater than that of arterial blood (Davenport, 1966).",

DCA is reabsorbed from the large intestine in significant quantities and is either rehydroxylated by the liver to CA and secreted (Lindstedt and Samuelsson, 1959) or secreted as the conjugated DCA. The extent to which bacteria transform the primary BA depends on the nature of the diet, the composition of the intestinal microflora, and the influences of these and other factors on intestinal motility (Gustafsson, 1969; Gustafsson et al., 1966; Gustafsson and Norman, 1969).",

(1978) suggest that motilin plays an important role in initiating interdigestive gastrointestinal contractions, which are referred to as the interdigestive motility complex or the migrating motility complex (MMC).",

Transport of water and water-soluble compounds is influenced by the permeability characteristics of the limiting membrane and by the nature of the driving forces that provide energy for transport. Passive movement occurs either by simple diffusion or as a result of concentration gradients (activity), pH, osmotic pressure, or electrical potential that may exist across the membrane. The movement of an ion in the direction of an electrochemical gradient is considered passive in nature. Active transport is said to occur when a substance moves in a direction opposite that of an established electrochemical gradient.",

In the case of nonelectrolytes such as glucose, active transport is defined as movement against a concentration gradient. Active transport requires metabolic energy and is inhibited by various metabolic blocking agents or by low temperature. (2) Facilitated diffusion occurs when the passive movement of a substance is more rapid than can be accounted for by simple diffusion. Facilitated diffusion systems may increase the rate of movement across the membrane by two or three orders of magnitude. The responsible carrier mechanism is similar to that involved in active transport in that it displays saturation kinetics, may be inhibited competitively, and is temperature dependent. However, transport does not occur against concentration or electrochemical gradients, and direct expenditure of energy is not required. (3) Exchange diffusion is a transfer mechanism similar to facilitated diffusion and was postulated originally to explain the rapid transfer of radioactive Na+ across epithelial cell membranes in vitro. The mechanism involves the exchange of one ion for another of like charge (e.g., Na+ and H+ or Cl\u2212 and HCO3\n\u2212), not giving rise to net transport but contributing in a major way to unidirectional flux rate.",

The transport of water and electrolytes by the intestinal mucosa is a dynamic process, with rapid unidirectional fluxes of both occurring continuously. Net absorption occurs when the flow from lumen to plasma exceeds that from plasma to lumen. Active transport of Na+ can occur along the entire length of the intestine, but the rate and net absorption is greatest in the ileum and colon. Na+ transport is by an energy-requiring \u201csodium pump\u201d mechanism that is intimately associated with the Na+-K+-ATPase located within the basolateral cell membrane of the absorptive epithelial cell. Three mechanisms exist for the entry of Na+ at the brush border: (1) electrodiffusion down a concentration gradient, (2) cotransport of electrolytes that either enter (Cl\u2212) or exit (H+) the cell as Na+ enters, and (3) Na+ entry coupled with organic nonelectrolytes (glucose, amino acids). Current evidence suggests that in the absence of the absorption of nonelectrolytes, electroneutral uptake accounts for most NaCl absorption. At the brush border, Na+ enters down a concentration gradient but exits at the basolateral cell surface against a substantial gradient. Maintenance of the transmembrane Na+ gradient by the Na pump requires continual metabolism and generation of ATP. The Na+-K+-ATPase can be inhibited by cardiac glycosides such as ouabain, which are effective inhibitors of Na+ transport. The Na+ gradient ultimately serves as an energy source for transport of other solutes (Schultz and Curran, 1970).",

Hypertonic saline solutions can be absorbed from canine intestine in vivo and from canine and rat intestine in vitro. These observations indicate that water absorption can occur against an activity gradient and that the process is dependent on metabolic energy. This suggests that an active transport process is involved, but Curran (1965) presented an alternate interpretation, which is now generally accepted. This view is that water transport occurs secondarily to active solute transport and is the result of local gradients established within the mucosal membrane. Water transport is then coupled to the energy-dependent processes responsible for solute transport but is one step removed from it.",

The food bolus mixed with saliva has a neutral or slightly alkaline pH as it enters the stomach, and a period of time is required for it to mix with gastric secretions and become acidified. Proteolytic digestion begins when the pH of the gastric contents approaches 4 and occurs optimally in two pH ranges, 1.6 to 2.4 and 3.3 to 4 (Taylor (1959a), Taylor (1959b)). Because of the relative lack of specificity of the pepsins, some peptide bonds of almost all dietary proteins are split during passage through the stomach. The gastric phase of protein digestion may have a minor and possibly dispensable role in overall protein assimilation (Freeman and Kim, 1978), but the reservoir function of the stomach contributes to the gradual release of nutrients, ensuring more efficient utilization in the small intestine.",

It is a difficult process to investigate because the products of proteolysis are absorbed rapidly after they are formed and, therefore, studies of luminal contents give only an estimate of the overall rate of protein digestion. Equally important, dietary protein is continually mixed with endogenous protein in the form of digestive secretions and extruded mucosal cells. Most endogenous proteins are hydrolyzed and the amino acids absorbed in a manner similar to that of dietary protein, and the two processes occur simultaneously. Endogenous protein accounts for a significant part of the amino acids of the intestinal contents. Even when dietary protein is labeled with a radioactive tracer, there is such rapid utilization that the tracer soon reenters the lumen in the form of endogenous protein secretion.",

Meister and his colleagues (1976) have suggested that GGT may function in translocation by interaction with extracellular amino acids and with intracellular glutathione. The hypothetical mechanism involves the noncovalent binding of extracellular amino acids to the plasma membrane, whereas intracellular glutathione interacts with GGT to yield a \u03d1-glutamyl-enzyme complex. When the \u03d1-glutamyl moiety is transferred to the membrane-bound amino acid, a \u03d1-glutamyl-amino acid complex is formed, which, when released from the membrane binding site, moves into the cell. The \u03d1-glutamyl-amino acid complex is split by the action of \u03d1-glutamyl cyclotransferase, an enzyme appropriately located in the cytosol. Glutathione is regenerated by means of the \u03d1-glutamyl cycle, which is a good substrate for GGT (Thompson and Meister, 1975).",

In the piglet, \u201cclosure\u201d occurs within 1 to 2 days (Leary and Lecce, 1978; Westrom et al., 1984) beginning in the duodenum and occurring last in the ileum. In rodents, protein absorption normally continues for approximately 3 weeks. The mechanism of intestinal \u201cclosure\u201d was studied, and researchers found that complete starvation of pigs lengthened the period of protein absorption to 4 to 5 days, whereas early feeding shortened the period (Lecce, 1965; Lecce and Morgan, 1962; Leece et al., 1964). Feeding different fractions of colostrum including lactose and galactose resulted in loss of protein absorptive capacity. The route of feeding may not be the critical factor, however. Calves that are prevented from eating but that receive nutrients parenterally lose the ability to absorb protein at the same time as control calves (Deutsch and Smith, 1957).",

Hypogammaglobulinemia is almost always demonstrable in calves dying of Gram-negative septicemia and is the result either of insufficient Ig intake or of insufficient intestinal absorption.

Most such individuals probably have insufficient colostrum intake. Even when calves were given the opportunity to ingest colostrum, however, a surprising number were hypogammaglobulinemic. Some of the reasons for varying gammaglobulinemia values are recognized, but the relative importance of each is not known. The concentration of lactoglobulin, the volume consumed (Selman et al., 1971), the time elapsed from birth to ingestion of colostrum (Selman et al., 1971), and the method of ingestion (natural suckling versus bucket feeding) may have an important influence on the serum IgG (McBeath et al., 1971; Smith et al., 1967). Calves that suckle their dams usually attain serum IgG concentrations that are higher than those attained by calves given colostrum from a bucket. The frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia may be influenced by season (Gay et al., 1965b; McEwan et al., 1970a), although this relationship is not consistent (Smith et al., 1967; Thornton et al., 1972). Familial factors also may influence development of hypogammaglobulinemia (Tennant et al., 1969).",

In the dog, gastric lipase plays a credible role in fat digestion, leading to the formation of fatty acids, which help coordinate gastric emptying and pancreatic secretions. In other species, the initial step in utilization of triglycerides occurs in the lumen of the proximal small intestine, where hydrolysis is catalyzed by pancreatic lipase. The pancreas secretes lipase in active form. The enzyme requires an oil-water interface for activity, so only emulsions of fat can be hydrolyzed. Enzyme activity is directly related to the surface area of the emulsion, so the smaller the emulsion particle, the greater the total surface area of a given quantity of triglyceride and the greater the rate of hydrolysis (Benzonana and Desnuelle, 1965). Bile salts are not an absolute requirement but favor hydrolysis by their detergent action, which causes formation of emulsions with small particle sizes and by stimulating lipase activity within the physiological pH range of the duodenum. A colipase is present in the pancreatic secretion, which facilitates the interaction of lipase with its triglyceride substrate and protects lipase from inactivation (Borgstrom and Erlanson, 1971).",

The precise mechanism is yet unclear, but present evidence suggests that the lipid contents of the micelle are somehow discharged at the cell surface and enter the mucosal cell in molecular rather than micellar form (Isselbacher, 1967). The net effect is the absorption of the end products of lipolysis and the exclusion of bile salts, which are absorbed farther down the intestine, primarily in the ileum. Uptake of fatty acids appears to be a passive process having no requirement for metabolic energy.\n",

The two biochemical pathways for triglyceride biosynthesis in the intestine are summarized in Figure 14-7\n. Direct acylation of monoglyceride occurs in the intestine and is the major pathway for lipogenesis in the intestine during normal fat absorption. The initial step in this series of reactions involves activation of fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetase, a reaction that requires Mg2+, ATP, and CoA and that has a marked specificity for long-chain fatty acids. This specificity explains the observation by Bloom et al. (1951) that medium- and short-chain fatty acids are not incorporated into triglycerides during intestinal transport but enter the portal circulation as nonesterified fatty acids. The activated fatty acids then react sequentially with mono- and diglycerides to form triglycerides in steps catalyzed by mono- and diglyceride transacylases. The enzymes responsible for this series of reactions are present in the microsomal fraction of the cell (Rao and Johnston, 1966). These enzymes occur together in the endoplasmic reticulum as a \u201ctriglyceride-synthetase\u201d complex.",

The affinity of cobalamin for haptocorrin is higher at acid pH than for IF, so most is bound to haptocorrin in the stomach. Upon entering the duodenum, haptocorrin is degraded by pancreatic proteases, and cobalamin is transferred from haptocorrin to IF, a process facilitated by the high affinity of IF for cobalamin at neutral pH. Cobalamin-IF complexes traverse the intestine until they bind to specific receptors (previously called IFCR, but recently dubbed cubilin) located in the microvillous pits of the apical brush border membrane of ileal enterocytes. Cobalamin is then transcytosed to the portal bloodstream and binds to a protein called transcobalamin 2(TC II), which mediates cobalamin absorption by target cells. A portion of cobalamin taken up by hepatocytes is rapidly (within an hour in the dog) reexcreted in bile bound to haptocorrin.

Retained abomasal contents may be regurgitated into the large reservoir of the rumen and sequestered there from other fluid compartments of the body. The net result is loss of H+ and Cl\u2212 ions and development of metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia. This metabolic syndrome often is associated with fluid distension of the rumen related to pyloric outflow obstruction. Similar distension of the rumen in the absence of hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis suggests more proximal obstruction of rumen outflow, namely the omasum.",

Chronic hypertrophic gastritis, which resembles Menetrier's disease in humans, has been demonstrated in the dog (Happe and van der Gagg, 1977; Kippins, 1978; van der Gagg et al., 1976; Van Kruiningen, 1977). Van Kruiningen's series of cases were basenjis that had concomitant lymphocytic-plasmocytic enteritis. The primary disease, however, has been observed in other breeds without intestinal lesions. Signs of illness usually involve chronic vomiting, weight loss, and occasionally diarrhea. Hypoalbuminemia occurs in most cases. In humans, hyperchlorhydria or achlorhydria can occur. The morphological changes in the stomach wall (hypertrophic rugae) and some of the clinical features help to differentiate this disease from gastric neoplasia.",

An increase in the rate of intestinal transit is one factor believed important in functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract in which \u201chypermotility\u201d has been considered to be the primary cause. Although increased intestinal motility may be a factor in certain types of diarrheal disease, when motility patterns have been investigated, diarrheal disease has actually been associated with decreased motility (Christensen et al., 1972). A second factor in the pathogenesis of diarrhea is decreased intestinal assimilation of nutrients that may result either from decreased intraluminal hydrolysis of nutrients (e.g., maldigestion resulting from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency), bile salt deficiency, or defective mucosal transport of nutrients (i.e., malabsorption) that results from various types of inflammatory bowel disease, villus atrophy, intestinal lymphoma, or intrinsic biochemical defects in the mucosal cell that interfere with digestion or absorption. Finally, increased intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes is a major factor in the pathogenesis of certain types of acute diarrhea.",

The most extensively studied enterotoxin is that produced by Vibrio cholerae. This bacterium produces a large-molecular-weight, heat-labile toxin (CT), one subunit of which has properties similar to those of the heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin produced by certain strains of E. coli (Richards and Douglas, 1978). The mechanism of action of CT is believed to involve the activation of adenylate cyclase. This membrane-bound enzyme converts ATP to cAMP, which through the action of protein kinase is responsible for the greatly increased secretion of water and electrolytes by the intestinal mucosa. Although species differences have been observed (Forsyth et al., 1978), this mechanism appears to be important in the mode of action of LT of E. coli as well (Richards and Douglas, 1978).\n",

This GTP-GDP system plays a critical role in the physiological regulation of adenylate cyclase.

In contrast to LT and CT, which induce intestinal Na+ and water secretion only after a lag phase of several hours, ST induces intestinal secretion immediately. ST induces intestinal secretion by activating guanylate cyclase and the mediator of intestinal secretion induced by ST is cyclic 3\u2032,5\u2032-guanosine monophosphate (Field et al., 1978; Hughes et al., 1978).",

Therapeutic trials with bismuth subsalicylate have significant therapeutic benefit in certain large-volume diarrheal diseases of humans, which are enterotoxigenic in origin (DuPont, 1978; DuPont et al., 1977; Portnoy et al., 1976). The mechanism of the intestinal secretion inhibition is not known, but the chemical relation of bismuth subsalicylate to other known prostaglandin inhibitors is known. It is possible that such drugs, by decreasing endogenous production of prostaglandin, decrease the basal level of cyclic nucleotides, which in turn causes an increase in the threshold of response to enterotoxin. Salicylates also may stimulate sodium chloride absorption (Powell et al., 1979). Collectively, these observations suggest that new, innovative methods for therapy and control of acute clinical diarrheal disease may be developed.",

The electrolyte composition of the stool in such cases is similar to that of the fluid found normally in the lumen of the small intestine, which in turn is similar to that of an ultrafiltrate of the plasma. The rapid dehydration that accompanies acute enteritis in the newborn soon produces hemoconcentration and leads to hypovolemic shock. These cases are characterized by metabolic acidosis (Dalton et al., 1965) caused by (1) decreased excretion of H+ resulting from decreased renal perfusion and (2) increased production of organic acids, the result of which is observed characteristically in young, severely dehydrated animals. Hyperkalemia in such cases is the result of increased movement of cellular K+ into the extracellular fluid and to decreased renal excretion. Cardiac irregularities caused by hyperkalemia can be demonstrated with the electrocardiogram, and cardiac arrest related to hyperkalemia is a direct cause of death in calves with acute diarrhea (Fisher, 1965; Fisher and McEwan, 1967b). Marked hypoglycemia also has been observed occasionally before death in calves with acute enteric infections. Hypoglycemia is believed to be due to decreased gluconeogenesis and increased anaerobic glycolysis, the result of hypovolemic shock (Tennant et al., 1968). The sequence of metabolic changes that occur during acute neonatal diarrhea is summarized in Figure 14-10\n.",

In such cases, the osmolality of the plasma is significantly decreased and hypotonic dehydration occurs.

The cardinal clinical signs of malabsorption include persistent or recurrent diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss.

Wheat-sensitive enteropathy has been described in the Irish setter breed (Batt et al., 1984). Most of the dogs were seen between 7 months to 2 years of age and had poor weight gain, weight loss, inappetence, or hyperphagia. Diarrhea was not a consistent observation. The most consistent morphological abnormality in peroral jejunal biopsies was partial villus atrophy. Enzymatic changes included decreased mucosal alkaline phosphatase and peptidases, whereas disaccharidases and GGT activities were unaffected. Recovery of morphological and biochemical abnormalities occurred in affected dogs that received cereal-free diets but recurred when wheat flour was added to the ration. A variety of other causes of intestinal malabsorption have been reported in the dog (Anderson (1975), Anderson (1977); Burrows et al., 1979; Ewing, 1971; Hill, 1972; Hill and Kelly, 1974; Schall, 1974; Van Kruiningen, 1968; Van Kruiningen and Hayden, 1973). An enteropathy said to resemble tropical sprue in humans has been described in German shepherds (Batt, Bush, & Peters (1983), Batt, Carter, & McLean (1984)). Affected dogs were 5 years of age or older and had diarrhea and weight loss for at least 4 months before the diagnosis was made. Peroral jejunal biopsies revealed partial villus atrophy and variable infiltrations of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria. Subcellar biochemical studies of jejunal enterocytes revealed decreased activity of many brush border enzymes and increased lysosomal enzymes.",

This level of fecal fat is quite constant and is independent of dietary fat intake over a wide range of 15 to 48 g/day.

Malabsorption of vitamin K can result in hypoprothrombinemia and delayed clotting of blood. Glucose malabsorption has been documented by Kaneko et al.

Intraluminal hydrolysis of fat may also be decreased because of a deficiency of bile salts caused either by decreased hepatic secretion or by bile duct obstruction.

The synthetic peptide N-benzoyltyrosine-P-aminobenzoic acid (bentiromide) is orally administered to dogs. If chymotrypsin is present in the duodenum, hydrolysis of the bentiromide occurs, and P-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is released, which is subsequently absorbed and then excreted in the urine within 6 h. The urine or plasma is analyzed for PABA. Less than 43% PABA excretion identifies dogs with suspected pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (Strombeck, 1978). Thirty- or 60-min blood levels of PABA are used to detect dogs with pancreatic exocrine disease (Zimmer and Todd, 1985), but this method did not identify dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as consistently as the 6 h urinary excretion (Strombeck and Harrold, 1982). Factors that may influence results of the bentiromide test include the rate of gastric emptying, intestinal absorption of the PABA, and the peptide cleavage by other peptidases (Batt et al., 1979).",

In canine malabsorption, the OGTT curve of blood glucose is diminished or flat (Kaneko et al., 1965). The test also has been used in the horse for evaluation of small intestinal malabsorption (Roberts and Hill, 1973). Dogs with pancreatic exocrine deficiency may have \u201cprediabetic\u201d or high OGTT curves (Hill and Kidder, 1972b). The major disadvantage of this test is that it does not differentiate between decreased intestinal absorption and increased tissue uptake after absorption. This problem can be alleviated by comparing results of the OGTT with those of the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Hill and Kidder (1972b) reported that normal dogs on low-carbohydrate/high protein diets can have \u201cdiabetic\u201d tolerance curves so that test dogs should be on a high-carbohydrate diet for 3 to 5 days before testing.",

SIBO is usually secondary to another disease process, but it has been reported as a primary idiopathic form. Many clinicians prefer to use the term antibiotic-responsive diarrhea instead of idiopathic SIBO (German et al., 2003).

Some investigators have concluded, for example, that as much as 50% or more of the normal catabolism of albumin (Campbell et al., 1961; Glenert, Jarnum, & Riemer (1961), Glenert, Jarnum, & Riemer (1962); Wetterfors (1964), Wetterfors (1965); Wetterfors et al., 1965) and \u03d1-globulin (Andersen et al., 1963) may occur in the gastro-intestinal tract.

In boxer dogs, the disease is characterized by intractable diarrhea that is often hemorrhagic. Histopathologically, there is a granulomatous or histiocytic submucosal infiltrate and the macrophages are laden with periodic-acid-Schiff-positive material. Immunopathological studies describe an increase in IgG3 and IgG4 plasma cells, PAS positive macrophages and CD3-T cells, L1- and MHC11-positive cells, with pathological lesions similar to human ulcerative colitis (German et al., 2003). Electron photomicrography demonstrated bacteria in the macrophages (Russell et al., 1971), and, in some instances, these organisms resembled Chlamydia. Mycoplasma has been cultured from the colon and regional lymph nodes in four boxers, but attempts to reproduce granulomatous colitis with Mycoplasma have been unsuccessful. Until recently, this failure to identify or isolate an infectious agent has led to the belief that granulomatous colitis of boxers is an immune-mediated disease.",

There is an increased absorption of ammonia across inflamed intestinal mucosa, or massive overproduction of ammonia within the lumen of the gut, or a combination of both. Under normal circumstances, ammonia is delivered to liver via portal circulation and is metabolized by the Krebs-Hensleit cycle to urea and glutamine. Systemic hyperammonemia results when this cycle is overwhelmed. Ammonia readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and, in high concentrations, has a toxic effect on neuronal cell membranes. Resulting encephalopathic signs may be reversible if the underlying intestinal lesion or ammonia-producing bacteria are treated in an appropriate manner.",

Fluid accumulates in the rumen because of the increased osmolality of the rumen fluid.

If affected animals survive the initial period of rapid fermentation, chemical rumenitis induced by the hyperosmolality of the rumen fluid and by the excess lactic acid may develop.

A soluble legume protein fraction with ribulose diphosphate carboxylase activity has been suggested as another important dietary factor in the pathogenesis of bloat (Howarth, 1975). Slime-producing bacteria also have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of frothy bloat. These microorganisms produce an extracellular polysaccharide that results in stable foam formation.",

This has been accomplished with certain nonionic detergents with surfactant properties that break up or prevent formation of foam within the rumen (Bartley, 1965). Another approach has been the prophylactic administration of sodium alkyl sulfonate, which inhibits pectin methyl esterase activity and prevents foam formation by eliminating the products of this enzyme reaction (Nichols, 1963). Antifoaming agents such as poloxalene administered before ingestion of bloat-producing diets have been shown to be effective prophylactically (Howarth, 1975). Silicone antifoaming agents also have been used for this purpose (Clark and Reid, 1974). Genetic selection of cattle that are less susceptible to rumen tympany has also been pursued (Howarth, 1975).",

Normally, NH3 is in equilibrium:NH3+H+\u2192NH4+with only 1% in the free form. Acidification shifts the equilibrium farther to the right, thereby reducing the amount of the NH3. Because only the free form crosses cell membranes, the net effect is a reduction of absorption of NH3 by the cell. Acetic acid is used as a treatment for urea poisoning, but it is of more value as a prophylactic agent (Word et al., 1969).",
