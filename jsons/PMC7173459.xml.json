However, due to inadequacy, unsafe, inaccessibility, and unaffordability of water, most of the people globally are deprived of this universal right. According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) report, some 3 in 10 people worldwide, or 2.1 billion, lack access to safe, readily available water at home and 6 in 10, or 4.5 billion, lack safely managed sanitation (WHO and UNICEF, 2017). Due to the global efforts, billions of people have gained access to basic drinking water and sanitation services since 2000, but people in many countries are still lacking clean water and proper sanitation in their homes, healthcare facilities, and schools. Hence health of all these people is at a risk, affecting mainly the infants and young children. Water, sanitation, and hygiene were responsible for 829,000 deaths from diarrheal disease in 2016. It is estimated that every year, 361,000 children under 5 years of age die because of diarrhea. In addition, poor sanitation and contaminated water are also linked to transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid (WHO and UNICEF, 2017).",

Consumption of these waters leads to waterborne disease outbreaks (WBDOs) (Patel et al., 2016). A recent study from China has shown that potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous across all of the 16 urban sampled surface waters, and Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most commonly detected phyla accounting for 21.9%\u201378.5% and 19.1%\u201374.7% of sequences, respectively (Jin et al., 2018). Intermittent water supply (IWS) is being practiced throughout low- to middle-income countries. A study was conducted by Bivins et al. (2017) with existing data using reference pathogens Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and rotavirus (RV) as conservative risk proxies for infections via bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, respectively. Their findings indicated that the median daily risk of infection is 1 in 23,500 for Campylobacter, 1 in 5,050,000 for Cryptosporidium, and 1 in 118,000 for RV. Based on these risks, IWS may account for 17.2 million infections causing 4.52 million cases of diarrhea, 109,000 diarrheal disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 1560 deaths each year. The WHO health-based normative guideline for drinking water is 10\u22126 DALYs per person per year and it is likely that the value of diarrheal disease associated with IWS will be surpassing the WHO value.",

Preparation of these guidelines is not an easy task and it needs thorough understanding about the pathogenic nature of the organisms considering their shape, size, composition, and structure, their survival and behavior, and how they transmit in different waterbodies. Many countries use indicator organisms to assess the microbiological quality of drinking water. Most widely used bacteria are the enteric bacterial coliforms belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. In addition to being able to identify the microbial contamination of drinking water with human waste, these organisms are capable of identifying the fecal contaminations in waters used for recreational activities as well as in shellfish production. The presence of these pathogenic organisms in waterbodies is being monitored regularly in most developed countries as new tools are available to them due to the advances made in medical and scientific research. Modern technologies have also been incorporated into the water treatment plants for the effective removal or deactivation of these waterborne pathogens, thereby minimizing the outbreaks and the risk due to exposure.",

It has more than 200 serovarieties, characterized by the structure of the lipopolysaccharide (O antigens). Only serovarieties O1 and O139 are involved in true cholera (Weintraub, 2003). Some other serovarieties can cause gastroenteritis. The serovariety O1 is subdivided into classical and El Tor biotypes based on their biochemical properties and phage susceptibilities. Only toxigenic strains have the CTX\u03a6 segment (7\u20139.7 kb) of the chromosome and this carries at least six genes which have the potential to encode cholera toxin. During chromosome replication, the CTX\u03a6 fragment is able to make an autonomous copy creating an independent plasmid. The plasmid produces virus-like particles, the CTX\u03a6 bacteriophages, which in turn infect nontoxigenic strains (Cabral, 2010). Epidemic and pandemic strains of V. cholerae contain another chromosomal segment designated as Vibrio Pathogenicity Island (VPI). VPI is 39.5 kb in size and contains two ToxR-regulated genes: a regulator of virulence genes (ToxT) and a gene cluster containing colonization factors, including the toxin co-regulated pili. Pathogen can be transmitted by the contaminated water or food via the fecal\u2013oral route. V. cholerae O1 or O139 strains are common in estuaries being isolated from estuarine animals, such as birds, frogs, fishes, and shellfish, and are able to survive and multiply on the surface of phytoplankton and zooplankton cells.",

The disease outbreaks are reported in all age groups including the elderly people (Lee et al., 2012).

In 1998, cyanobacteria were included as a microbial contaminant to CCL because of their potential for transmission through drinking water. Furthermore, microcystin-LR, cylindrospermopsin, and anatoxin-a produced by several species of cyanobacteria are also included in the CCL. These cyanotoxins have been reported from water reservoirs around the world which had caused acute and chronic illnesses in animals and humans (Liyanage et al., 2016). Exposure to cyanotoxins can be through contaminated drinking water, ingestion and dermal skin contact during recreational activities (Fig. 2.2\n), inhalation of aerosols, medical treatments (dialysis), or through algal food supplements.\n",

They are obligate intracellular, spore-forming protists. The spore is the only stage that can survive outside the host cell in their life cycle and it contains a characteristic coiled polar filament for injecting the sporoplasm into a host cell to initiate infection. After infection, a complex process of multiplication takes place within an infected cell and new spores are produced and released to feces, urine, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids, depending on the type of species and the site of infection. Among 14 human pathogenic Microsporidia species, two species, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis, are the most prevalent species which associated with gastrointestinal disease in humans. Person-to-person contact and ingestion of spores in water and food contaminated with human feces or urine are considered as important routes of exposure. A study by Dowd et al. (1998) showed that 7 out of 14 water concentrates tested were contaminated with E. intestinalis, E. bieneusi, and Vittaforma corneae which represent human pathogenic microsporidia species. Their study is the first species level confirmation of human pathogenic microsporidia in water, indicating that these human pathogenic microsporidia possibly be waterborne pathogens. Microsporidiosis is an emerging disease in immunosuppressed persons with AIDS, but microsporidia have the ability to cause disease even in immunologically normal hosts.",

Most of these microorganisms are ubiquitous in waters regardless of ground, surface, fresh, or marine. People utilize these waters for drinking, cooking, and other domestic actions, bathing, medically, and also for recreations. The water sources become polluted due to the mixing of fecal matter from human and animal and also waste generated by other direct and indirect anthropogenic activities. As a result, waters become reservoirs for the pathogens making it unsafe for human consumption causing many waterborne diseases. In addition, with the increase in global population, changes in climatic patterns, and the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in waste waters, it is predicted that there will be a rise in waterborne diseases especially diarrhea and cholera. Therefore, still the global populations infants, young, or old are at a risk from waterborne diseases and outbreaks whether the countries are developed or developing or in tropics or temperate in geographical distribution. Hence to minimize the adverse effects from these waterborne pathogens and to improve the water quality, regular monitoring of water sources is essential with advanced but cost-effective detection techniques, precise disinfectant procedures with proper management.",
