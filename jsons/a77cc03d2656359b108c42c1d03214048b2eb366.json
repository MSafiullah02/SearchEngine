Transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from a mean of 2.05 days before symptom onset for Hong Kong to 1.72 days after symptom onset for Wuhan. Proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 33.7% in Wuhan to 72.7% in Hong Kong. Based on individual estimates, transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from mean of 2.95 days before symptom onset to 1.72 days after symptom onset and proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 33.7% to 79.9%. Simple unweighted pooling of estimates based on serial intervals resulted in a mean time of transmission of 0.67 days before symptoms, and an estimated 56.1% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic period.",

There is substantial potential for pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in a range of different contexts. Our work suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely in the day before symptom onset whereas estimates suggesting most pre-symptomatic transmission highlighted a mean transmission times almost 3 days before symptom onset. These findings highlight the urgent need for extremely rapid and effective case detection, contact tracing and quarantine measures if strict social distancing measures are to be eased.",

This model suggests that presymptomatic transmission alone can account for a basic reproductive number of 0.9 (47% of the overall reproductive basic number), almost enough to sustain an epidemic on its own. However, this estimate may be influenced by the low level of asymptomatic infectiousness (10% relative to a symptomatic case) assumed by that model. This uncertainty highlights the need for transmission from asymptomatically infected people to be more fully understood, and to be considered as having potentially distinct characteristics compared to the presymptomatic transmission that we report on in this paper.",

Therefore, a limitation of our study is that all our data sources cannot be considered completely independent. We partially address this by grouping estimates by the source location of the contact-tracing data upon which they were based. A strength of our approach is that it builds a picture of pre-symptomatic transmission from a range of estimates in the literature, facilitates discussion for the drivers of variation between them, and highlights the consistent message that consideration of pre-symptomatic transmission is critical for COVID-19 control policy. The important insights into COVID-19 transmission gleaned from the studies that contributed to our analyses, that used publicly available transmission pair data, highlights the immense value of allowing public access to anonymised transmission pair data.",

Our source level analyses describe a trend in presymptomatic transmission ranging from the greatest proportion in Hong Kong (72.7%) to the smallest proportion in Wuhan (33.7%). The range in the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission that we report is consistent with other studies [25,26,28,29,32] where reports of pre-symptomatic transmission range from 37% to >80%. The wide variation in estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and transmission time relative to symptom onset is expected, as the observed transmission events depend on contact rates between infectious and susceptible people as well as the natural course of infectiousness. The variation in observed transmission events is manifested by variations in serial interval and generation time, and therefore in transmission relative to symptom onset. Griffin et al. [34] discuss drivers of this variation and the limitations in different approaches to estimating generation time and serial interval from transmission pairs.If people are quarantined once their symptoms become apparent, a greater proportion transmission will be pre-symptomatic. Whilst data relating to the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan amount to only 6 pairs, we see a trend towards lower proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission in this context, as well as in the early stages of the outbreaks in Italy, possibly corresponding to relatively more transmission from symptomatic people in the early stages of disease incursion. Two other studies also highlight this contrast in the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in a different context. Zhao et al.[52] show that serial interval became shorter in Hong Kong and Shenzhen as time elapsed from initial cases, and suggest that this is due to increasing effectiveness of quarantining people with symptoms over time.Zhang [32]  contrasts a mean transmission time of 2.3 days after symptoms in the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak (with relatively fewer quarantine measures) to a mean transmission time of 2.4 days before symptom onset amongst imported cases outside Wuhan.",

Despite the variety of methodologies used to estimate transmission time, results of our analysis gave similar ranges to the six other studies that investigated pre-symptomatic transmission in different contexts [25-29,32]. Case reports [11-20] and virological studies [21-23] support the occurrence of presymptomatic transmission suggested by quantitative approaches. Whilst samples testing positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) do not always fully correlate with infectiousness [24,56,57], relatively lower cycle threshold (CT) values suggest higher virus loads. Two studies [21,23] that reported pre-symptomatic PCR CT values included some relatively low values. A report of pre-symptomatic PCR positive samples in ten nursing home residents reported a mean time of 3 days from sampling to onset of symptoms.

Proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission amongst the different data source categories ranged from 33.7% in Wuhan to 72.7% in Hong Kong. Our results show that transmission time ranged from mean of 2.95 days before symptom onset to 1.72 days after symptom onset. Simple unweighted pooling of the 23 estimates based on serial intervals resulted in a mean time of transmission of 0.67 days before symptoms. From this, it can be inferred that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely in the day before symptom onset. The estimates suggesting most pre-symptomatic transmission highlighted a mean transmission times almost 3 days before symptom onset. This is consistent with other estimates in the literature, ranging from 2.65 days before symptoms to 2.3 days after symptoms [25-29,32].
