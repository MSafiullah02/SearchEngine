While war metaphors have limitations, we know from the experiences of clinicians in China, Italy, and Switzerland that care of patients with COVID-19 results in major ethical dilemmas and a psychological toll on the health care teams caring for them, in part due to limited resources (14, 35) . Frontline staff are at risk of secondary or vicarious trauma, as a result of repeated empathic engagement with sadness and loss (36) , as well as moral injury (37), resulting from actions, or the lack of them, which violate one's moral or ethical code. This can lead to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress (38) .",

Self-care strategies and individual 'resilience tools' such as mindfulness and reflective practice are insufficient; resilience should not become another responsibility of staff working in traumatic conditions, but requires an organisational and systemic response (40) . Organisations should actively monitor frontline staff, facilitate effective team cohesion and implement strategies to support teams' day-to-day work, including informal debriefing and peer support. Single-session psychological debriefing approaches should be avoided as they may cause additional harm (39) . Leaders and organisations should also make professional sources of support readily available; this includes formal bereavement counselling, which can enhance awareness about vicarious traumatisation and encourage adaptive coping strategies (36) .",

Evidence suggests several risk factors for poor bereavement outcomes in COVID-19, including severe breathlessness, patient isolation, and disruption to relatives' social support networks. Understanding the risk of trauma and moral injury to staff in the current pandemic is essential for the early identification and prevention of harm. Drawing on best available evidence, we have made recommendations for mitigating negative effects on bereaved relatives and healthcare professionals. These include proactive, sensitive and regular communication with family members alongside accurate information provision; enabling family members to say goodbye in person and supporting virtual communication; providing excellent symptom management and emotional and spiritual support; sign-posting to bereavement services; and supporting bereaved relatives to adapt funerals and seek appropriate bereavement support, as well as consistent leadership and support for health professionals in the frontline.",
