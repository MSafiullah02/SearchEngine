As the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and Europe, COPD results in a substantial and ever increasing economic and social burden [1]. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are frequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although there is no standardized definition, AECOPD are characterized by a significant change in patient symptoms from baseline accompanied by overall increased airway resistance [2]. These exacerbations carry a significant risk to patients, with 10 % in-hospital mortality and 1-year and 2-year all-cause mortality rates of 43 % and 49 %, respectively, in patients with hypercapnic exacerbations [3]. Other studies note in-hospital mortality rates as high as 30 % with worse outcomes associated with older age, severity of respiratory and non-respiratory organ dysfunction, and hospital length of stay [4]. Given that patients transferred to the ICU with AECOPD are at high risk for complications and adverse outcomes, early diagnosis and management are critical to improve patient outcomes and survival in this population.",

Data suggests that 50\u201370 % of AECOPD are due to respiratory infections, with greater than 50 % being due to bacterial pathogens. The most commonly isolated organisms include Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-negative rods are isolated less frequently but are more common in patients with advanced disease and more severe exacerbations as well as those with diabetes. Patients may be chronically colonized with bacteria in the respiratory tract, but it is unclear whether asymptomatic colonization leads to exacerbations caused by the same bacterial strains or predisposes to new bacterial growth. Atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumonia may be responsible for up to 14 % of exacerbations [2, 5].",

It is important to appreciate the severity of underlying airflow limitation, comorbid conditions, duration of worsened symptoms, current outpatient treatment regimen, and previous exacerbations including any prior need for mechanical ventilation. Patients with severe exacerbations presenting to the ICU will often have signs of increased work of breathing including accessory muscle use, paradoxical chest or abdominal wall movements, cyanosis, altered mental status, and hemodynamic instability [8]. A focused cardiopulmonary exam is recommended with close attention to work of breathing including use of accessory respiratory muscles, ability to speak in complete sentences, degree of air movement and adventitious lung sounds on auscultation, evidence of volume overload including jugular venous distension (JVD) and peripheral edema, presence of cardiac arrhythmias, and cyanosis.

Important differential diagnoses in patients with severe dyspnea and/or impending respiratory failure include congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrhythmia, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, acute infectious processes such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, and exacerbations of other underlying pulmonary conditions such as interstitial lung disease. These conditions may coexist with or precipitate AECOPD. Thus, it is important to pursue a thorough diagnostic workup in tandem with ongoing therapeutic interventions. Additional diagnostic measures including chest computerized tomography (CT), echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, brain naturetic peptide (BNP), and respiratory viral molecular testing should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Spirometry during an acute exacerbation is not recommended as it is likely to be both difficult for the patient to perform and provide an inaccurate assessment of lung function.",

            "text": "Systemic glucocorticoids are considered a cornerstone of therapy in AECOPD, particularly in patients ill enough to warrant ICU admission. Although the optimal formulation, duration, and dosage of treatment remains unclear, studies have shown that systemic steroids accelerate improvement in airflow, gas exchange, and symptoms in addition to reducing the rate of treatment failure [11]. A trial by Niewoehner and colleagues demonstrated that there was no benefit of 8 weeks of steroid treatment compared to 2 weeks [12]. Although some studies in patients with AECOPD suggest that a 5-day regimen of 40 mg of prednisone may be superior to 14 days, no trials have clearly defined the optimal regimen for patients with severe exacerbations requiring ICU admission [13]. In general, we recommend intravenous steroid administration with 0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg methylprednisolone every 6 h for 24 h with tapering to twice daily and then daily over the course of 2\u20133 days as tolerated for patients with severe exacerbations admitted to the ICU. In general, the duration of treatment should not exceed 14 days. Oral steroids are likely equivalent to intravenous formulations if the patient can take pills by mouth. Careful monitoring for side effects including alterations in cognition, hyperglycemia, insomnia, fluid retention, and peptic ulcer formation is essential; routine H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor prescription should accompany steroid therapy in those admitted to the ICU [14].",

There is no evidence to support combination therapy, although albuterol and ipratropium are frequently used concurrently, particularly in patients requiring ICU admission [15]. For non-intubated patients admitted to the ICU, we recommend these medications be administered in nebulized form as inhaler use is difficult for patients with significant respiratory distress.

            "text": "Given that the majority of AECOPD are thought to be due to bacterial infections, the empiric administration of antibiotics in patients with COPD exacerbations has been frequently studied [15]. Antibiotic use during COPD exacerbations reduces treatment failures, need for mechanical ventilation, risk for readmission, as well as mortality when administered in the inpatient setting [16\u201318]. A study by Anthonisen et al. showed that patients with increases in sputum production or changes in sputum color experienced a greater benefit from antibiotics [19]. In addition, a study of patients with AECOPD requiring mechanical ventilation showed that administration of a fluoroquinolone reduced mortality and the need for additional antibiotics when compared to placebo [20]. Therefore, antibiotics are recommended for patients admitted to the ICU, particularly those requiring mechanical ventilation [1, 8]. The choice of antibiotic should be based on local bacterial resistance patterns and cover the common pathogens associated with exacerbations (H. influenza, S. pneumonia, M. catarrhalis). Antibiotic selection varies based on whether or not an exacerbation is considered complicated as these patients may be at risk for P. aeruginosa, gram-negative enteric Bacilli, or other resistant bacterial strains.

This dynamic hyperinflation creates auto-PEEP (in contrast to the intentional application of extrinsic PEEP via mechanical ventilation). The presence of auto-PEEP is important as it can increase the work of breathing, trigger patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and worsen gas exchange.

Typically PH is discussed in the context of true pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) resulting from pressure elevations in the pulmonary arterial system or pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) occurring secondary to pressure elevations in the pulmonary venous and capillary systems. PVH is typically seen in the setting of elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressures (PAOP) resulting from volume overload in left ventricular (LV) failure. This distinction becomes important in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and in treatment decisions.",

Rising pulmonary pressures create increases in afterload that are difficult for the RV to overcome. The right heart attempts to compensate for rising pressures by dilating acutely and hypertrophying chronically. However, these compensatory mechanisms are maladaptive, and the resulting volume overload that ensues as cardiac output declines ultimately leads to RVF. As the RV fails, stroke volume and cardiac output drop further, leading to cardiogenic shock. In the ICU setting, RVF is typically acute but occasionally may be due to worsening of underlying chronic PH [28, 29].",

Adequate systemic blood pressure is necessary to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac function, and thus vasopressors may be a necessary first-line or adjunct therapy [32]. As with inotropic support, careful selection of the most appropriate vasopressor will vary depending on the clinical scenario. The increased risk of tachyarrhythmias with all vasoactive agents is an important consideration given the potential hemodynamic impact on myocardial oxygen consumption, coronary artery flow demand, and RV filling time.",

The presence of atrial arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia) and electrical conduction delays (e.g., complete heart block) is associated with worse outcomes given that the RV is highly dependent on atrial contraction to maintain adequate filling. Rate control alone is not typically sufficient and rhythm control is recommended. Electrical cardioversion for tachyarrhythmias and atrioventricular (AV) pacing for bradyarrhythmias are the first-line treatments for unstable patients. Amiodarone is the recommended first-line medication for most tachyarrhythmias due to its lower risk of hypotension and comparatively fewer negative inotropic effects. The use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers is generally avoided given that both classes of agents may impair RV contractility as well as AV nodal conduction [32, 33].",

The risk for systemic hypotension and hemodynamic collapse during intubation as a result of sedative administration is significant. Ongoing ventilator support with positive-pressure ventilation may also have untoward effects as the positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure and may result in decreased venous return and hypotension. Therefore, noninvasive ventilation should be considered prior to intubation if the patient\u2019s clinical condition is stable enough for a trial. However, if intubation is necessary, etomidate is the preferred drug for induction of general anesthesia given its minimal effect of cardiac contractility and vascular tone. One should recognize that controversy exists regarding the effects of etomidate on later adrenal function, and alternative agents should be considered dictated by provider training and agent availability. Preemptive administration of vasopressors and or inotropes prior to intubation to offset the commonly induced hypotension should also be considered [32, 35].",
