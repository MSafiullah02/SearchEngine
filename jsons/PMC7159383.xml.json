Dendritic cells bear sole responsibility for the stimulation of virgin T lymphocytes, a property that distinguishes them from all other APC (e.g. B cells).\n2\n\n,\n\n3\n The DC are also essential accessory cells in the generation of primary antibody responses\n4\n and are powerful enhancers of NK cell cytotoxicity.\n5\n Conversely, DC are also involved in the maintenance of tolerance to antigens, with DC in the thymus contributing towards shaping of the T cell repertoire by deleting autoreactive lymphocytes.\n6\n\n,\n\n7\n As a consequence of this heterogeneity in vivo, it is now acknowledged that DC are a family of cells, with each subset exerting control over a different area of immunity. In terms of origin, DC are bone marrow derived cells originating from both myeloid and lymphoid precursors.\n8\n\n,\n\n9\n Examples of DC in vivo include the epidermal Langerhans cell, the interstitial DC (found in the heart, lungs, liver and other organs), the veiled DC found in afferent lymph, interdigitating DC (found in T cell\u2010rich areas of lymphoid tissue) and thymic DC. Follicular DC (FDC) are an exception to this group because they are believed to be involved in the long\u2010term maintenance of B cell memory by retaining immune complexes; these cells differ markedly from the aforementioned group and will not be discussed here (reviewed by Tew et al.\n\n10\n).",

As a consequence, the DC has a high surface area permitting intimate contact with a large number of surrounding cells. As proof of this point, in vitro DC form large spherical aggregates with lymphocytes, and experimentally, only one mature DC is required to stimulate 100\u20133000 T cells. Dendritic cells also possess an array of mechanisms for sampling antigen. These include macropinocytosis, where fluid from the extracellular milieu is taken up into pinocytic vesicles and antigen is concentrated by expelling excess water via channels called aquaporins.\n11\n The DC also expresses a repertoire of receptors for efficient receptor\u2010mediated antigen uptake. Additional receptors expressed by DC include Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), Fc\u03b3RI (CD64),\n12\n\n,\n\n13\n Fc\u03b5RI\n14\n and the C3 bi complement receptors (CD11b),\n15\n which increase the efficiency of immune complex endocytosis.

The unique ability of DC to attract and stimulate na\u00efve T cells at this point is still poorly understood; however, it appears that DC secrete a C\u2010C chemokine (DC\u2010CK1) that selectively attracts these cells,\n44\n while both DC and activated B cells produce a C\u2010C chemokine ABCD\u20101 that attracts mature T cells.\n45\n Dendritic cells, by virtue of their high levels of surface MHC\u2010II and costimulator expression, readily cluster CD4+ T helper cells. Two different subsets of dendritic cells have recently been characterized that control the fate of na\u00efve T helper cells.\n46\n One subset, designated DC1, secretes large quantities of IL\u201012 that promotes the development of a Th1\u2010type phenotype, which is important in the generation of immunity to intracellular parasites. Another subset, the DC2, promotes a Th2 pattern of cytokine production via the release of an as yet uncharacterized factor. The Th2 responses are important in the generation of immunity to extracellular infections and also in allergic responses. The interaction of the CD4/TCR complex with DC1 MHC\u2010II has significant effects on the cytokine production of DC, one of the most important being enhancement of IL\u201012 production. Expression of CD40L by T helper cells further stimulates the production of IL\u201012 and IL\u201015 from DC.\n47\n\n,\n\n48\n The secretion of these Th1\u2010type cytokines by DC is important in enhancing the generation of cytotoxic T cells from na\u00efve CD8+ T cells.

The interaction of DC\u2010expressed CD40 with CD40L on NK cells has also been shown to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production.\n5\n\n",

The activation status of the DC themselves is thought to have an impact on viral replication, with immature and cutaneous DC supporting productive infection of macrophage tropic virus, while mature DC are able to transport HIV but appear unable to replicate both T cell and macrophage tropic strains of virus.\n65\n A further interesting observation is that viruses derived from infected DC carry T cell\u2010specific factors that make them highly infectious.\n66\n The mechanisms used by HIV to subvert antigen presentation by DC undoubtedly have direct parallels in other viral infections.

The simplest method of obtaining DC is by allowing PBMC to adhere to tissue culture dishes for 2 h. After several washes, the adherent fraction will be enriched for CD14+ monocytes. Immature DC can then be produced using GM\u2010CSF + IL\u20104/IL\u201013. The GM\u2010CSF has the effect of restricting differentiation towards a myelomonocytic lineage, while IL\u20104 or IL\u201013 inhibits the development of macrophages.\n122\n The overall result is a forced differentiation towards a DC lineage. Cells obtained from in vitro culture with high doses of GM\u2010CSF and IL\u20104/IL\u201013 resemble immature DC, in that they have a high affinity for soluble antigen and express lower levels of costimulatory molecules than the activated form.\n123\n Subsequent addition of TNF\u2010\u03b1, LPS or CD40L to a culture of these DC promotes maturation and activation, as would be expected from the discussion of DC life history presented earlier.
