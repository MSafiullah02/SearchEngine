Graphical abstract Influence of fireworks emission on aerosol aging process at lower 1 troposphere and associated health risks in an urban region of eastern 2 central India 3 4 Abstract 25 To study the influence of fireworks in atmospheric aerosols and their effect on health during the 26 extreme firework days, fireworks tracer metals and carbonaceous species in size-distributed aerosols 27 in the lower troposphere at Raipur in eastern central India were investigated during the 2018 28 Deepawali festival.

Bimodal size-distribution 30 with intense fine mode peak was found for Na during DDP. Bimodal distribution with fine mode 31 intense peak was found for K during DDP. The bimodal size distribution of K was found common 32 for other events because of biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP 33 indicated mixed sources from biomass burning and fireworks. During DDP, K and Ca were well 34 correlated (r 2 =0.93) together. Strong metal-metal correlations were found between the following 35 pairs, Zn-Fe, Cu-Fe and Cu-Ca, which indicated the similar firecrackers burning source. The 36 atmospheric aging of aerosols was also found significantly high during fireworks days. Aging of 37 aerosols were higher because of heterogeneous reactions of SO 2 and NO x on aerosols directly emitted 38 from fireworks. The observed high values of inhalation dose of elemental carbon during DDP period 39 imposed higher risk of respiratory diseases.

In spite of eye-catching colorful visual appearance in 53 the sky with the continuous sound of detonation of firecrackers, this short-term emission, results in 54 large airborne gaseous as well as particle pollutants in the troposphere (Pongpiachan et al., 2017; 55 Bencardino et al., 2018). This emission leads to serious environmental implications, which results in 56 the deterioration of health quality and life expectancy. For instance, due to severe airborne pollution 57 in China, the government has declared a ban on manufacturing, sales and bursting of firecrackers in 58 some cities from 1993-2006 to overcome such situations (Han et al., 2007). In New Delhi worst 59 atmospheric condition was observed during November 2017, because of sudden rise in particulate containing metals can penetrate into the deeper region of the human respiratory system. Enormous 91 inhalable metal containing PMs are released due to firecracker burning during Deepawali festival 92 (Godri et al. 2010; Nirmalkar et al., 2013). Throughout the Deepawali festival, the PM 10 abundance 93 is found to be 2-6 folds higher than the normal days (Joly et al. 2010, Segura et al., 2013). 94 Firecrackers burning events discharge organic and inorganic matter into the air, which induces turbid 95 atmosphere and dense clouds, the nature of which depends upon the constituents of the firecrackers. 96 Gunpowder, KNO 3, and color producing metals like, Aluminum (Al), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium 97 (Mg), sodium (Na), Iron (Fe) and Potassium (K) are the common constituents of firecrackers. Hence, 98 they produce various chemical species in the atmosphere which have harmful human health effects 99 (Vecchi et al., 2008). Smoke particles from the fireworks emission penetrate through the respiratory 100 system and generate health problems like cough, fever, and dyspnoea and also cause acute 101 eosinophilic pneumonia (Hirai et al., 2000; Barnett et al., 2005; Hamad et al., 2016). 102 Regular study of the size distribution of aerosols has great importance because their behavior, 103 formation mechanism and human health effects are directly associated with the size of the 104 tropospheric aerosols (Hillamo et al., 1988; Haywood et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012; Remskar et al., values were subtracted from the samples.

It can be also seen 273 from the table that abundance of all metals was highest in the fine mode over coarse mode (except 274 Ca and K) during DDP because the burning of crackers emits freshly borne elements into the air, 275 which causes size distribution dominated in fine mode. The metals selected as markers (Fe, Ca, Cu, 276 Zn, K, Na and Mg) of firecrackers emission were similar to an earlier study conducted by Pervez et 277 al. (2016).

Deshmukh and coworkers (2017) have reported that 350 the two main sources of atmospheric Ca are mineral dust and sea salt. Here, the fine mode peak 351 during DDP in our study is possibly due to the extreme firecrackers burning and the coarse mode 352 peak is due to absorption of gaseous precursors and particles over the surface of mineral dusts. 353 In case of Mg, there was a bimodal size distribution with a peak in fine mode (0.43-1.1\u00b5m) 354 and a peak in coarse mode (4.7-9 \u00b5m) obtained for BDP, DDP and ADP.

A 389 bimodal size distribution of OC (a dominated coarse mode peak at 3.3-4.7 \u03bcm and fine mode peak at 390 0.65-1.1 \u03bcm) was found over the entire period. The concentrations in each size fractions were highly 391 enhanced during extreme firework period. Similar size distribution was found by Deshmukh et al. 392 (2017) in which highly oxidized water-soluble organic aerosols formation from biomass burning was 393 reported as dominant source of fine mode aerosols at Raipur. Similarly, a bimodal size distribution of 394 EC was obtained during BDP, DDP and ADP periods. The fine mode dominated peak at 0.65-1.1 395 \u03bcm of EC was found in all the different study periods. The reason could be due to the primary 396 emission from combustion sources. Kong et al. (2015) have also reported high EC loading during 397 extreme firework days in China.398 The carbonaceous aerosols (EC, OC and WSOC) exhibited a large deviation of the concentration 399 in all size fractions, during BDP, ADP and DDP event (Figure 6). The OC itself contains many 400 fractions like POC, SOC, and WSOC (Tang et al., 2016). The carbonaceous aerosols are derived 401 from diverse sources. The atmospheric variables like, relative humidity, ambient temperature, wind 402 speed and boundary layer dynamics also play significant role towards the total OC loading (Jurado et 403 al., 2008; Nirmalkar et al., 2020). Apart from the emission sources and their emission strength, the 404 atmospheric variables are major causes that control the size distribution of carbonaceous aerosols. 405 The SOC formation during the aging process is also significant at Raipur. Hence, the extent of POC 406 and SOC along with atmospheric variables could be the reason for large deviation in the 407 carbonaceous aerosols loading at urban area of Raipur. In addition, firecrackers burning activities 408 and their delayed effect could add a significant carbonaceous component in the troposphere during 409 DDP and ADP. Hence, it can be concluded that the dynamics of boundary layers, atmospheric 410 variables, diverse sources and their emission strength, SOA formation and atmospheric aging were 411 the possible reasons for large deviation in the size distribution of carbonaceous aerosols. 412 WSOC are mainly produced from primary emission and from secondary organic aerosols 413 formation process through gas phase oxidation of VOC in troposphere. WSOC like levoglucosan and 414 mannosan are highly water-soluble species produced from biomass burning activities (Fu et al., 415 Al (r 2 =0.644) and Cu (r 2 =0.56). Such correlations were found possibly due to emission of these 438 metals from similar sources, i.e., cementation or construction activities from nearby areas (Matawle 439 et al., 2014). However, all other metals were weakly or negatively correlated with each other during 440 this event indicating diverse sources. A strong correlation between Na and Fe was found common in 441all the events, whereas the correlations between Na with Al and Cu with Fe were found common in 442 BDP and DDP, which indicated that a common source has also affected all of the events.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF12": {"text": "Time series variation 444 Time series variations of ultra-fine, fine and coarse particles during all the events in 2018 are 445 displayed in Fig. 6, 7 and 8. Higher abundances of fireworks tracer metals in ultra-fine, fine and 446 coarse particles observed during DDP were mainly due to the burning of the enormous number of 447 firecrackers in this festival. It could be observed from the figure that all the DDP events have high 448 loading compared to BDP and ADP. During DDP bursting firecrackers had led to an increase in fine 449 particles over coarse particles. During DDP, all coarse particles had high loading over other events 450 because of the particle's growth. It has been reported that fine particles can accumulate or condense 451 together to form coarse particles (Pandey et al., 2012). Similar variation trends towards increase and 452 decrease in concentration of metals were found among the pairs, Fe-Al and Na-Zn during DDP only. 453 This indicated the dominance of similar sources of variation during Deepawali period. The variation 454 trends of Mg-K were found common over entire study period but an overall high loading was found 455 only during DDP.

However, no significant attempts were made on the atmospheric aging associated 460 with fireworks particles in ultra-fine, fine and coarse size fractions. It is emphasized that during DDP 461 period the contribution of anthropogenic sources other than the fireworks emissions were less, so the 462 atmosphere during DDP period days was mainly influenced from the significant contribution of 463 fireworks, atmospheric aging processes, dispersion, deposition and transformations of particles. 464 Sarkar et al. (2010) have reported that the primary pollutants like NO x , SO 2 etc. emitted during 465 fireworks may act as oxidizer to form secondary organic and inorganic aerosols or may get adsorbed 466 on pre-existed aerosols particles. Significantly high WSOC/OC ratio was observed during DDP Table 2) events indicated high loading of atmospherically aged particles in firework days. Low wind 468 speed and lower boundary layer height facilitates trapping the gaseous pollutants near ground level, 469 and high relative humidity triggers the formation of SOA that further condenses over pre-existing 470 aerosols (Sotiropoulou et al., 2006). This could be the reason for significant coarse mode loading of 471 aerosols suggesting occurrence of atmospheric aerosols aging in eastern central India during DDP. 472 Many of the other works have reported the significant secondary formation of released from fireworks burning (Wang et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2014). Do et al. (2012) 474reported that soot-EC is directly emitted from fireworks. They have found strong correlation between .56) indicating that both of these chemical species adhere on to soot 476 particles. In another work OC/EC ratio of 6.8 was reported during fireworks in Chinese New Year 477 festival, which was reported to be due to the high enrichment of OC1, OC2 and OPC. All478 carbonaceous fractions are related to volatile nature of organic matters used for firecrackers 479 production. The reported smelting points of ployxyethylene, polyvinyl alcohol and shell-lac were 480 212, 230 and 115-120 C, respectively, and all these temperatures were less than the detecting temperature of OC2 fraction, i.e., 230 C (Zhang et al., 2013). Accordingly, in our work too, these 482 carbonaceous aerosols fractions (OC1 and OC2) were directly emitted to the atmosphere from 483fireworks. It is quite interesting to note that although aging process includes the coarse particles 484 formation which have relatively lower health risks compared to fine particles, but the aged particles 485 are highly contaminated with metals, carbonaceous aerosols and secondary organic aerosols which 486 can cause high health risks.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF14": {"text": "Health problems associated with aerosols 488 In recent years, air quality and public health have become one of the most emerging issues due to a 489 wide variety of chemical constituents and different size of particulate matters (PMs) released from a 490 variety of sources into the atmosphere (Castro et al., 2015). UNICEF (2016) has published a report in 491 which they mentioned that in developing countries approximately 0.6 million children die every year 492 due to inadequate air quality. A study conducted in China found mortality rates of 0.36 and 0.42% 493 due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively (Lu et al., 2015). 494 Inhalation dose of EC is calculated to study the influence of EC on human health.

In addition, 523 coarse particles abundance during DDP was also found highest over ADP and BDP. The reason 524 possibly may be the growth of the fine particles because they can condense together and form larger 525 particles. Fine particles can enter lower respiratory tract, i.e., trachea and alveoli, so they are more 526 harmful than the coarse particles.527Apart from high loading DDP period, the concentrations of metals and carbonaceous aerosols 528 were also found higher during ADP than BDP in all size fractions. This should be due to the delayed 529 effect of atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols emitted from the firecrackers can last long in the530 troposphere. It could be condensed over the particles phase and present in over particle during aging 531 process. Similarly, Kong et al. (2015) also reported that the long existence of firecrackers derived 532 chemical species in the atmosphere after the intense firecrackers burning event. This was reported 533 due to delayed effect of firecrackers emission and long residence time of atmospheric aerosols. In 534 another study the mean aerosol residence times in the troposphere was calculated to be 1 to 25 days 535 indicating the significance of delayed effect (D\u0142ugosz-Lisiecka et al., 2012). 536 When we are dealing with PMs and their opposite effect on human health, the major factor 537 that controls the path of particles into respiratory system is the aerodynamic diameter that depends 538 upon the sources and formation mechanism of aerosols (Li et al., 2014; Castro et al., 2015; Chen et 539 al., 2017). Cilia and mucus of respiratory tract filter particles with larger than 10 \u00b5m size but 540 particles with less than 10 \u00b5m diameter are inhalable particles. They accommodate in the upper 541 respiratory system but if inhaled it would be discarded by coughing and sneezing (Kim et al., 2015). 542 Particles with size <2.5 \u03bcm and <1 \u03bcm are given more attention because of their extreme bad health 543 impact due to their deeper approach into the human respiratory system (Dockery, 2001). Several 544 studies conducted worldwide have reported occurrence of major diseases due to bad air quality, i.e., 545 cardiovascular dysfunction, acute asthma, decreased lung function, lower resistance to foreign 546 substances, etc. (Tapanainen et al., 2012). Some indoor and outdoor burning sources of aerosols have 547 been reported carcinogenic (Vu et al., 2012; Canha et al., 2016). Air pollutants analysis at global 548 level shows that atmospheric particulates are responsible for the 5% cancer cases (lung, trachea, 549 bronchi), 2% cases of mortality due to cardio-respiratory problems and 1% mortality due to the 550 respiratory infections (Bryce et al., 2005). 551 Once metals enter in the blood circulation via respiratory system, they can cause adverse 552 health impact like Al may cause Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, Osteomalacia, slow bone 553 growth in infants, microcytic anemia etc. (Palazzolo et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2017). Aluminum is 554 reported as a potential carcinogen, they are capable of causing fatal conditions like sinonasal and 555 lung cancer. Once, Al enters in a blood circulation it can aggregate and affects the brain, kidneys, 556 and liver. Cu is an essential element at low abundances. However, Cu inhalation may cause 557 eosinophilia, alveolar migration of macrophages and formation of histiocytic and-caseating 558 granulomas (Pappas, 2011). Copper may also cause eye irritation, nausea, chronic overexposure: 559 damage to the liver and kidneys, anemia, acute copper poisoning: methemoglobinemia, liver injury, 560 hemolytic anemia, epigastric pain, headache, dizziness, massive gastrointestinal bleeding, 561 tachycardia, respiratory difficulty, liver and kidney failure, and death (Williams et al., 2017; Sawlani 562 et al., 2019).

Bimodal size distribution with intense fine mode peak was found for 580 Na during DDP. A common bimodal size distribution with fine mode intense peak was found for K 581 in all three events possibly due to biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP 582 indicated couple of sources such as firecrackers emission along with biomass burning. During DDP, 583 K and Ca were well correlated together, which was not found during BDP. It clearly indicated584 similar source of K and Ca, i.e., firecrackers burning, during DDP. Strong correlations between 585 metal pairs Zn-Fe, Cu-Fe and Cu-Ca have been found. The salts of these metals are commonly mixed 586 together in firecrackers to produce different colors on burning. This possibly gives a justifiable 587 reason for such strong positive correlation among tracer metals in aerosols during Deepawali festival.588 The significant metals and carbonaceous aerosols were found during ADP in coarse fine and 589 ultrafine size fractions. This should be significant residence time of atmospheric aerosols. Fire-590 crackers derived atmospheric aerosols were found to be existed several days after the firecrackers 591 burning event and can alter the atmospheric chemistry. Fine particles can approach lower respiratory 592 tract, i.e., trachea, and alveoli, so they are more harmful entities over coarse particles. The extreme 593 fireworks in Deepawali festivals have apparently altered the compositions of size-distributed 594 aerosols with elevated metals and organic matters loading. The contributions of SOC formed by gas 595 to particle conversion gradually rose in firework days during aging processes. The particles emitted 596 from fireworks obviously underwent aging processes as we have found significant coarse mode 597 loading of metals and carbonaceous aerosols during firework days. Aging of particles were 598 characterized by heterogeneous reactions of directly emitted NO x and SO 2 from fireworks on 599 particles in the troposphere.
