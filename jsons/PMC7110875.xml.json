Recently, the spike (S) protein has been proposed to be recognized by TLR2 and provoke the pro-inflammatory cytokines release [16], [17], [18]. However, little is known about the role of single-strand RNA (ssRNA) in the SARS-CoV as a kind of potential PAMP. Since a GU (guanosine and uridine) rich ssRNA40 from the U5 region of HIV-1 was identified as a natural agonist of TLR7 and TLR8 [19], it is attractive if there are immune stimulatory ssRNAs existed in about 30 kb length of single-stranded SARS-CoV RNA genome, and the relevant immune effect is still unrevealed.",

            "text": "In conclusion, here we have successfully identified the extraordinary GU-rich ssRNAs with powerful immunostimulatory activity from SARS-CoV, which are able to provoke a strong pro-inflammatory response via the TLR7/8 recognition and cause acute lung injury leading to death. These findings testify that GU-rich ssRNAs of SARS-CoV play a key role in the overactive innate immune response. This study not only presents new evidence to comprehensively interpret the occurrence of cytokine storm and the immune pathogenetic mechanism behind the SARS-CoV infection, but also provides an important clue for a new therapeutic strategy.",
