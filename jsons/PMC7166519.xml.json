            "text": "Otitis media (OM) is a serious healthcare problem in both developed and developing countries. OM refers to the inflammation of the area behind the tympanic membrane called the middle ear (Fig. 1A). The inflammatory mediators generated during OM can penetrate from middle to inner ear potentially leading to hearing loss (Fig. 1A). OM\u2010mediated hearing loss can have serious consequences especially during childhood, including delayed language development and impaired communication. OM accounts for more than 25 million visits to physician's offices and is associated with significant healthcare costs. OM can be broadly classified into acute and chronic types. Acute otitis media (AOM) refers to any type of swelling of the tympanic membrane or otorrhea that is not attributable to otitis externa (Fig. 1B). Typically, the presentation includes inflammation of the middle ear or symptoms of infection (Fig. 1B).1 The most common pathogens associated with AOM include Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and Moraxella catarrhalis.2, 3, 4, 5, 6 In some cases, despite antimicrobial therapy, AOM progresses to chronic OM (COM). The most frequent type of COM is chronic suppurative OM (CSOM), characterized by tympanic membrane perforation and purulent discharge (Fig. 1B).",

Broadly, the two general types of immune defense mechanisms are innate and adaptive immune responses. Each are composed of unique but interrelated cellular and secretory components. In addition, mechanical, chemical, and microbiologic barriers, including mucin production in the middle ear (Fig. 1C), provide protection against invading pathogens. If an otopathogen manages to cross the epithelial barrier, it is then subject to recognition by neutrophils and macrophages. At times, however, the innate immune system may not be able to clear otopathogens and hence it may require lymphocytes and the adaptive immune system to halt invasion. The lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system give a more versatile defense that can provide lasting protection against subsequent reinfection from the same pathogen. The aim of this review article is to summarize the immune responses present in the middle ear and how otopathogens evade these responses to induce OM.",

Beyond the epithelium's basic function as a physical barrier by virtue of tight junctions, epithelial cells combine the mechanical action of mucociliary transport with the production of other chemical barriers. Some epithelial cells function to produce lysozyme, and this combines with mucoid and serous mucus from adjacent goblet cells. This mixture is antimicrobial in nature and prevents epithelial cell invasion by otopathogens. The mucociliary transport apparatus traps glycoproteins and mucus, ultimately propelling the fluid downward through the Eustachian tube and into the nasopharynx. Other innate defense mechanisms that prevent bacterial and viral pathogenicity on the epithelial surface can be described in terms of their secretory and nonsecretory nature. Importantly, secretory cells create mucins, lactotransferrin, lysozyme, defensins, and surfactants. These secretions foster a balanced, clean environment in the middle ear through both chemical and microbiologic mechanisms of action.7, 8, 9 Hence, both flow and antimicrobial proteins provide protection against potential invasive otopathogens.10 The middle ear also maintains inherently protective constituents including defensins, SPLUNC1, mucin, lysozymes, and TLRs.9\n",

Although researchers continue to investigate NTHi's pathogenic mechanism, it is known that NTHi activates MUC5AC mucin transcription once the bacterial cell has been disturbed.65 The initial step required to stimulate MUC5AC transcription is the triggering of p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase. Conversely, a negative feedback mechanism exists in which phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase\u2010Akt pathway leads to inactivation of NTHi\u2010influenced MUC5AC transcription by communicating with p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase pathway.65 Ultimately, the activation of this pathway can lead to an overabundance of mucin, thereby contributing to conductive hearing loss in COME, decreased mucociliary clearance, increasing the bacterial retention in the middle ear and persistent infection.65 Further, it has recently been discovered that curcumin, the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (Curcuma longa), is an inhibitor of NTHi\u2010associated MUC5AC production.66 The molecular mechanisms by which cucurmin down\u2010regulates MUC5AC transcription is through the manipulation of AP\u20101, a transcription factor in the MAPK pathway.

A) The presence of simple sequence repeats (SSR) in outer membrane proteins of otopathogens leads to simple strand mispairing during genome replication. This causes alteration in DNA sequence and consequently \u201cOFF/ON\u201d expression of selected proteins. Due to unavailability of selected protein during \u201cOFF\u201d expression, antibody against the target is not able to recognize it leading to evasion of potent immune responses. B) Otopathogens can employ phasevariome genome variation leading to alteration of multiple genes and proteins. Antibodies are no longer able to recognize or bind with very low affinity to altered proteins leading to subversion of host immune responses",
