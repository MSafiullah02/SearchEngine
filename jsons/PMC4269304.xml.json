This tidy, linear view of biology is quickly being replaced with models that emphasize the complex landscape of interactions between these macromolecules. At the center lies RNA. It is now well established that complex RNA structures are capable of functions previously thought to be the purview of proteins, including ligand binding and catalysis. These RNA structure\u2010mediated functions also include regulation of nearly every step of cellular protein production. Some of the regulatory mechanisms discussed below have been thoughtfully reviewed previously. Our goal in this review is not to duplicate these reviews but to present the argument that the three\u2010dimensional structure of messenger RNA (mRNA) constitutes an additional layer of genetic information that both guides and regulates the production of encoded proteins.",

Consequently, developing a better understanding of how RNA structure governs protein expression and function has broad\u2010ranging implications.

This allows the nascent aptamer domain to sample the cellular environment and potentially bind a cognate ligand before the expression domain is transcribed and folded, as recently observed in a co\u2010transcriptional folding study of the adenine riboswitch [10]. Critically, this timing allows folding of one of the mutually exclusive structures that can be adopted by the riboswitch. For example, in many strains of bacteria, ligand binding to an aptamer domain causes an expression platform to form an intrinsic terminator stem, an RNA hairpin followed by a stretch of six or more uracil (U) residues, that inhibits RNA polymerase extension (Fig. 1A) [11, 12]. In the absence of ligand, the unbound aptamer domain structure allows the anti\u2010terminator stem\u2010loop to form, sequestering the poly\u2010U stretch and allowing mRNA synthesis to proceed. This type of regulation is exemplified by the T\u2010box mechanism: if an uncharged tRNA binds to an element in the mRNA encoding the synthetase responsible for charging the particular tRNA, an anti\u2010terminator helix forms that permits transcription of the message encoding the aminoacyl\u2010tRNA synthetase [13]. In contrast, the charged tRNA does not bind strongly to the terminator helix. In most cases, as in this example, the riboswitch mechanisms are negative feedback loops wherein a given ligand down regulates enzymes involved in ligand production. Although uncommon, there are examples of riboswitches that turn protein expression on rather than off. For example, ligand binding to the adenine riboswitch in Bacillus subtilis results in increased expression of proteins involved in adenine export [14].",

While bacterial TTP riboswitches typically exert control at the level of transcription [22], these elements regulate alternative splicing in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic TPP riboswitches are typically located in intronic regions of genes associated with thiamine metabolism. Differences in secondary structure between ligand\u2010bound and unbound forms of the precursor mRNA (pre\u2010mRNA) sequester, expose, or relocate splice sites resulting in alternatively spliced mRNAs. Inclusion or exclusion of upstream open reading frames (ORFs) in mRNAs affects the identity of the synthesized protein. Neurospora crassa contains several TPP riboswitches and provides the best understood examples of eukaryotic riboswitches. In the NMT1 riboswitch, ligand binding causes formation of a structure that exposes an alternative splice site that prevents production of the major ORF product (Fig. 1B) [19]. A recent study, also in N. crassa, suggests that a TPP riboswitch in the NCU01977 gene controls formation of long\u2010distance base pairs [23]. These base pairs do not cover or reveal splice sites, but rather place a 5\u2032 splice donor and 3\u2032 acceptor in favorable proximity [23]. These different forms of splicing control within a single organism highlight the functional diversity of riboswitch elements.",

When the glmS ribozyme self\u2010cleaves, a terminus recognized by RNase J1 is produced, and RNase J degrades the remaining mRNA. Another example of riboswitch modulation of mRNA stability is found in the p27 tumor suppressor mRNA [25]. A riboswitch in this mRNA binds the Pumilio RNA\u2010binding protein (PUM1) and causes an allosteric RNA rearrangement that reveals an miRNA target.

Cooperative binding of two glycine molecules, for example, likely evolved to allow precise response to cellular concentrations of glycine [31]. Another unique example found in L. monocytogenes is an RNA thermosensor. A 5\u2032 UTR structure that inhibits translation of prfA virulence factor at temperatures below 37 \u00b0C [32].

Initiation is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) that are recruited through a series of recognition events (reviewed in [33]). This process begins with recognition and binding of the 5\u2032 cap by the eIF4 cap\u2010binding complex. This event leads to formation of the 48S initiation complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the 40S ribosomal subunit and several eIFs. This initiation complex scans the mRNA from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 for an AUG start codon [34, 35]. At the start codon, the complex stalls, the eIFs dissociate, and the remainder of the ribosome is recruited to form an 80S unit. It is only at this point that the elongation stage of translation begins. Initiation is the rate\u2010limiting step of translation and regulation of this event allows tight control of protein expression. RNA structures play regulatory roles in canonical translation initiation; for example, extensive, stable mRNA structure can interfere with a scanning ribosomal complex [36].",

Eukaryotic mRNAs with IRES elements encode proteins required for apoptosis, cell development, oncogenesis and for survival of nutrient stress, hypoxia, heat shock, and viral infection (reviewed in [37]). These conditions coincide with a decline in cap\u2010dependent translation initiation, and IRES mechanisms allow the cell to respond with synthesis of appropriate proteins. For example, during apoptosis, the mRNA encoding c\u2010myc, a transcription enhancer important to apoptosis and cancer mechanisms, switches from canonical to IRES\u2010mediated translation initiation and is actively produced despite inactivation of cap\u2010dependent translation [38]. This may be a widespread cellular strategy. In silico analyses estimate that nearly 10% of cellular mRNAs have IRES activity [39]. In addition, viruses often contain highly structured 5\u2032 regions incompatible with traditional translation initiation, and may lack the 5\u2032 cap or poly(A) tail required for canonical translation [40].

Various cis\u2010acting elements, such as Shine\u2013Dalgarno\u2010like sequences and stop codons [64, 65], are capable of inducing frameshifting, but most frameshifting events are mediated by highly structured RNA elements [66, 67, 68]. The cis\u2010element within the mRNA pauses a translating ribosome's active site over the slippery sequence (Fig. 3\nA). The codon\u2013anticodon interactions are momentarily disrupted, and the ribosome advances two or four nucleotides in the case of \u22121 and +1 frameshifting, respectively, before translation continues. The efficiencies of frameshifting sites vary depending on the features of the elements involved [66, 69, 70]. Even low levels of programmed frameshifting, less than 10%, can have large functional consequences.",

            "text": "RNA pseudoknots are structural motifs that are often found at both \u22121 and +1 ribosomal frameshifting sites, presumably due to their ability to resist the helicase activity of the ribosome [71]. Pseudoknots contain a minimum of two base\u2010paired helices; nucleotides within the loop of one helix base pair with nucleotides outside the stem region to form the \u201cpseudoknotted\u201d structure [72]. An example of pseudoknot within a \u22121 frameshifting element in mammalian cells is found in the mouse embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated (Edr) gene [73] (Fig. 3B). Edr and the human ortholog PEG10 are highly expressed during development and encode proteins with two overlapping reading frames [74, 75]. A pseudoknot structure also can be found in the +1 frameshifting sites within eukaryotic antizyme genes [76, 77], which encode inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase [78]. Translation of functional proteins from these genes requires a +1 frameshift [79]. The AZ1 frameshifting site is complex and is composed of a (UGC UCC UGA) slippery sequence flanked by a 5\u2032 regulatory element and pseudoknot (Fig. 3C) [76, 79]. The slippery sequence contains a UGA stop\u2010codon that will terminate protein translation unless a frameshift occurs. Increased levels of polyamines, the downstream products of ornithine decarboxylase, up regulate levels of frameshifting through action of the 5\u2032 regulatory element [80].",

The frameshifting element was initially suggested to consist of the slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) and a simple stem\u2010loop structure [70]; however, this simple model has been revised as studies of this element suggested that additional sequences are required for biological activity [81]. Studies of the frameshifting element in the context of the intact HIV\u20101 genomic RNA suggest that the stem\u2010loop is part of a larger structured RNA domain (Fig. 3D) [82].

The programed frameshift in SARS\u2010CoV appears to regulate the ratios of SARS viral proteins. The frameshifting element in SARS\u2010CoV contains a stem\u2010loop in one of the pseudoknot loops (Fig. 3E) [84]. The end of this internal stem\u2010loop structure contains a palindromic sequence that allows the element to dimerize (Fig. 3E) [85]. Mutations that interfered with dimerization of this domain, both reduced frameshifting efficiency and inhibited viral replication [85].

The rate of translation can significantly impact protein folding [89]. The most extensively studied examples of regulated translational pausing in cells are at rare codons. Rare codons, those codons with low abundance tRNA partners, often occur at the junctions between independently folding protein domains [90]. Ribosomal pausing at these rare codons is thought to facilitate the folding of native proteins in cells [91]. The correlation between translational pausing and rare codon frequency is imperfect, and there is also evidence that mRNA structure modulates translation rates. For example, when individual ribosomes translating an RNA hairpin were monitored using optical tweezers, the length of time that the ribosome paused during translation was dependent on the stability of the RNA structure [92]; stable structures are eventually unwound by the mechanical forces exerted by the ribosome [93].",

Ash1p is a transcription factor that is localized to newly formed daughter cells during mitosis and regulates mating\u2010type switching. During mitosis, four structured elements within the coding sequence of the ASH1 mRNA function both to localize the mRNA to newly forming cells and also to translationally silence the mRNA in the mother cell [94, 95]. These two activities are separable: When the structured RNA elements are moved from the coding sequence to the 3\u2032 UTR, the mRNA is correctly localized, but localization of the Ash1p protein is impaired [96]. The structured elements within the ASH1 mRNA appear to function as ribosome stop\u2010lights, preventing protein translation until proper localization of the message. Another example of the effect of mRNA structure on protein translation comes from analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human pain regulator gene catechol\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase (COMT) [97]. Polymorphisms within the COMT gene are associated with increased pain sensitivity in humans [98]. The increased pain sensitivity phenotypes are caused by dramatic increases in COMT protein levels due to changes in the global structure of the mRNA [97, 99]. These differences in COMT protein expression are attributed, in part, to structural changes near the start codon that affect translational efficiency of the mRNA [99].",

The RNA probing technology SHAPE was used to analyze the structure of an HIV\u20101 genomic RNA [82]. The regions of the genomic RNA that encode polyprotein linkers and interdomain loops within HIV\u20101 proteins are highly structured (Fig. 4\nA and B). This direct correlation between the structure of the mRNA and the organization of protein domains suggests that these structured regions of the mRNA function as ribosomal pause sites and facilitate the folding of active viral proteins. The hypothesis that structures within coding regions of mRNAs play an important role in protein folding is also supported by analysis of the mRNA transcriptome in yeast [100]. A technology termed PARS was used to probe the structures of over 3000 yeast mRNAs. There is a correlation between mRNA structure and the organization of coding sequences such that both the start and stop codons generally occur in regions that lack stable structures (Fig. 4C). The internal coding regions of most mRNAs appear to have a significantly higher level of structure than the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. Taken together, these recent studies suggest that RNA structure represents a second layer of information, an RNA structurome [101], that regulates the kinetics of protein production to ensure proper expression and folding.",
