The ncRNAs transcribed by eukaryotic cells can be divided into two groups, regulatory and housekeeping RNAs depending on their expression pattern and function. The tRNA and rRNA are considered housekeeping RNAs due to their basic and unchanged functions. All miRNAs, circRNAs and lncRNAs belong to regulatory ncRNAs. In addition, lncRNAs are the main ncRNAs, accounting for more than 80% of the total ncRNAs (Kapranov et al., 2007). Therefore, studies on long noncoding RNAs have been important to the transcriptome. Although an accumulating number of lncRNAs have been discovered and found to be vital in many biological processes, the roles that lncRNAs may play during viral infection still await further exploration.",

            "text": "LncRNAs longer than 200 bp are a newly discovered class of ncRNAs and can be distinguished from short RNAs, such as microRNAs, based on length (Nagano and Fraser, 2011). Some lncRNAs can be longer than 100 kb (Ponting et al., 2009). The majority of discovered lncRNAs have a 5\u2032 cap structure and are polyadenylated. Due to the lack of translated proteins, lncRNAs were considered \u201ctranscription noise\u201d or \u201cjunk RNA\u201d. However, lncRNAs have already been shown to be a key factor in the regulation of gene expression, especially in cancer research (Gong et al., 2016, Huang et al., 2016, Jiang et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2015). Recent studies demonstrated that viral infection can alter host lncRNA expression profile. More than 500 lncRNAs were observed with differential expression levels in mice after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection (Peng et al., 2010). A microarray analysis showed that the expression levels of more than 4800 lncRNAs were changed during enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection (Yin et al., 2013). Some researchers also reported the distinctive kinetics of lncRNA expression profiles during infectious bursal disease virus and Marek's disease virus infections in chicken (He et al., 2015). It was shown that lncRNAs were also involved in HIV and influenza virus infections (Rice, 2015, Trypsteen et al., 2016, Winterling et al., 2014). These studies suggested that lncRNAs may be involved in regulating the interactions between the host response and viral infection.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly devastating enteric disease in pigs, characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting and watery diarrhea. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), as the causative agent of PED, is a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family (Pensaert and Bouck, 1978). This virus infects pigs of all ages. The mortality rate is associated with the age of pigs, causing an over 90% death rate in piglets up to one week of age. The mortality decreases to 10% in piglets at the age of day 10 or thereafter. PEDV can only cause mild symptoms in older animals. Virulent PEDV strains have reemerged since 2010 and caused significant economic concern to the global pork industry (Chen et al., 2008, Li et al., 2012b, Mole, 2013, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Stevenson et al., 2013). Although the understanding of the molecular virology, epidemiology and vaccinology of PEDV has greatly improved since the reemergence of these strains, the molecular mechanism and transcriptional dynamics of the host response to PEDV infection remain unclear. There are several reports investigating the mechanisms of immune responses and the pathogenesis of PEDV. However, there are no studies on lncRNAs expression and their potential functions of these molecules in virus-host interactions based on a nucleic acid-based centric view.",

The PEDV initiated its replication soon after infection and maintained a logarithmic phage replication trend between 12 and 48 hpi, peaked at 48 hpi and remained in the plateau phase until 72 hpi (\nFig. 1A). Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets and subjected to real-time PCR analysis to determine the expression levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL), which represents early host immune responses to viral infection. The results showed that the expression level of all three target genes was significantly upregulated, peaking at 36 hpi, and declining to normal levels thereafter (Fig. 1B). All of these data indicated that the host immune system responded to PEDV infection at an early stage of infection.

The filtered reads were then mapped to the pig genome (GCA_000003025.4, Ensembl). A total of 6188 novel lncRNAs and 9004 protein-coding transcripts were identified from all samples. The coding RNA was the most abundant RNA identified in our samples, accounting for approximately 59.3% of all sequenced RNAs. The rest RNA molecules were lncRNAs.

According to our analysis, 69% of lncRNAs were located in intergenic regions, 4% lncRNAs were antisense transcripts and 7% lncRNAs were generated from intronic regions. The remaining 20% of lncRNAs were overlap-lncRNAs (Fig. 2B). Within the treatment groups at different time points, 5492 lncRNAs were stably expressed in each group and 696 lncRNAs were expressed in different groups (Fig. 2C).

Together with lncRNA 88504, 88529 and 251608, these two lncRNAs belonged to the intestinal IgA production and cytokine-to-cytokine receptor signaling pathways.

At 12 hpi, the piglets infected with PEDV displayed vomiting and watery diarrhea. After 24 hpi, the piglets refused to eat and showed dehydration. At 48 hpi, the piglets could not stand and were on the verge of death. The three mock-infected piglets were healthy and had good appetites. We then euthanized the infected and mock-infected piglets and collected the ileum from each piglet for virus titration and lncRNA validation. The results demonstrated that the piglets were successfully infected with PEDV while the mock-treated piglets were not infected (\nFig. 5A). All of the lncRNAs selected were highly upregulated in the ileum of PEDV-infected newborn piglets compared to those in PBS inoculated newborn piglets (Fig. 5B). Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that lncRNA-9606 was most significantly upregulated, with a 300- to 1300-fold increase (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). This lncRNA was predicted to be involved in the intestinal immune network for IgA production. IgA was indicated to be the most important antibody against PEDV infection in the small intestine. All other lncRNAs were upregulated approximately 60-fold. LncRNAs predicted to be involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway showed higher levels than the lncRNAs predicted to be involved in other pathways related to immune responses. These results suggest that the lncRNAs detected in this study may play important roles in host antiviral responses.

More than 6100 candidate lncRNAs were identified. These lncRNAs were characterized by lower expression levels and shorter transcript lengths. These properties were also observed in other reported lncRNAs within the mammalian genome (Cabili et al., 2011, He et al., 2015, Peng et al., 2010, Ulitsky et al., 2011, Young et al., 2012, Boltana et al., 2016, Li et al., 2012a, Okazaki et al., 2002, Ulitsky et al., 2011). In addition, GO term enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that various immune signaling pathways and antiviral responses may be regulated by cellular lncRNAs in response to PEDV infection. Real-time PCR evaluated the differential expression of twenty lncRNAs at different time points in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that PEDV infection could alter the expression of cellular lncRNAs; thus, these lncRNAs may have potential to regulate host immune signaling pathways and antiviral responses.",

The genome of primitive species such as worms and yeast contains a much smaller number and a lower ratio of lncRNAs to protein-coding genes than advanced species. Thus, the more complicated the life activity is, the more lncRNAs their genome contains and these molecules are involved in nearly every process of the life cycle.",

Invertebrates only have nonspecific phagocytic function and inflammatory reaction abilities. In invertebrate lymphocytes, the degree of differentiation and division is still very poor. In mammals, there are specific immune organs, immune cells and immune molecules for identifying and eliminating antigens. The increasing number of lncRNAs may be partly related to the immune system in higher organisms. In our study, many lncRNAs were coexpressed with genes that are involved in host immune signaling and antiviral responses, including JAK/STAT, NF-\u03baB, MAPK, cytokine to cytokine receptor, TGF-\u03b2, T cell receptor signaling pathway and IgA production signaling pathways, which supports the above hypothesis.

Thus, the mucosal immune response is the most powerful defense system against PEDV. IgA is secreted by the mucosal immune system for neutralizing antigens (Blutt and Conner, 2013). The activation of cytokines, TGF-\u03b2 and T cells is essential for the production of IgA. TGF-\u03b21 plays a pivotal role in intestinal cellular and immune regulation (Min and Kim, 2003, Ohtsuka and Sanderson, 2000). In the presence of TGF-\u03b2, peritoneal B cells switch to IgA more potently than other peritoneal B cell subpopulations (Roy et al., 2013). With the help of TGF-\u03b2, the costimulation from the CD4+ T helper cell subset via the CD40-CD40L interaction contributes to the switch from an IgM to an IgA isotype (Cazac and Roes, 2000, Tsuji et al., 2009). Various cytokines, such as IL-13, IL-17A and IL-21, also contribute greatly to this process (Cao et al., 2015, Dann et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2016). LncRNAs 159, 160, 164, 165, coexpressed with genes involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway, were all upregulated at 12 hpi and 36 hpi in IPEC-J2 cells and in the ileum. LncRNA-9606, which are coexpressed with a gene related to IgA production was significantly up-regulated in both PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells and piglets. This result strongly proves that PEDV infection may activate the specific expression of several lncRNAs and that these lncRNAs may potentially activate the immune response.",

Previous studies have shown that there are strong expression correlations between lncRNAs and neighboring protein-coding genes than for randomly selected protein-coding gene pairs (Cabili et al., 2011, Guttman et al., 2011, He et al., 2015, Pauli et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2010). We searched the neighboring coding transcript of lncRNA 9606 and found that the T cell receptor alpha chain V region was located within a 2 kb region from lncRNA 9606. Additionally, the KEGG analysis indicated that lncRNA 9606 was included in the intestinal immune network for the IgA production pathway. Therefore, we speculated that lncRNA 9606 may activate the TCR to sense the antigen and then promote IgA production. We performed an alignment search and the results indicated that lncRNA 9606 shared a query coverage of over 60% but lower than 75% between various genes, such as adenylate kinase 3-like 1 (AK3L1), interferon \u03b1 receptor 1 (IFNAR1), solute carrier family 46 member 3 (SLC46A3), and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). IFNAR1 and TLR2 play important roles in host defense against viral infection. LncRNA 9606 may also potentially function in these processes. Notably, to guarantee the reliability of lncRNA detection, all primer sets were designed according to their unique regions to avoid the interference of other similar genes.",

After transcription, lncRNAs can be associated with chromatin-modifying enzymes and transcription factors or form ribonucleoprotein complexes (Mattick et al., 2009, Mercer et al., 2009, Nagano and Fraser, 2011, Satpathy and Chang, 2015). Although proteins are thought to be the executors of life activities, lncRNAs may perform much better than proteins. These molecules can regulate gene expression much faster than proteins because the production of RNAs needs only transcription. A correlation of expression between lncRNAs and their neighboring protein-coding genes has been widely described in previous studies (Cabili et al., 2011, Guttman et al., 2011, He et al., 2015, Pauli et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2010) and observed in our study. The association of lncRNAs with chromatin-modifying complexes has been recognized as the reason for the coexpression (Khalil et al., 2009, Peng et al., 2010). By using this method, lncRNAs may regulate the expression of their neighboring genes. Once the lncRNAs are knocked down, they can change the neighboring gene expression patterns (Guttman et al., 2011). This mechanism is indeed a fast and reliable method for the regulation of gene expression.",

There were also many differentially expressed lncRNAs identified between mock-infected cells of different culture times (Fig. 3B). This effect may be due to the time and spatial-temporal expression of lncRNAs. The expression of lncRNAs can be affected by many factors, such as cell type, tissue type, development stage, culture time and stimulants (Cabili et al., 2011, Gaiti et al., 2015, Guo et al., 2016, Hart and Goff, 2016, Pauli et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2016). The reasons for this effect can be explained as above. Every life activity needs the participation of lncRNAs.",

Since the discovery of miRNA and lncRNA, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that RNA could also directly or indirectly interact with viruses. Considering the large number and rapid transcription of RNA, these molecules may play a greater role in the regulating host-virus response. In this study, we first employed RNA-seq technology to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed during PEDV infection. Several lncRNAs potentially involved in the host response to PEDV infection were selected and identified by RT-qPCR. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathways, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were found to be regulated during PEDV infection in our study and the proteome study (Lin et al., 2017). Our study further discovered a number of DE lncRNAs that are potentially involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway and intestinal immune network for IgA production. These data have provided novel targets for studies on host-virus interactions. Therefore, an RNA-centric view of virus-host interactions should also be considered for a better understanding of virus infection. To our knowledge, this study is the first to illustrate the expression profile of lncRNAs in newborn piglets against PEDV infection.",
