Alterations in proteolytic activity occur during pathological conditions such as cancer. One of the major deregulated classes of proteases in cancer is caspases, the proteolytic initiators and mediators of the apoptotic machinery. The ability to image apoptosis noninvasively in living cells and animal models of cancer can not only provide new insight into the biological basis of the disease but can also be used as a quantitative tool to screen and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. Optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence-based genetically engineered biosensors has been developed in our laboratory and exploited to study protease activity in animal models with a high signal to noise. Using the circularly permuted form of firefly luciferase, we have developed a reporter for Caspase 3/7, referred to as Caspase 3/7 GloSensor. Here, we discuss the use of the Caspase 3/7 GloSensor for imaging apoptotic activity in mouse xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and present the potential of this powerful platform technology to image the proteolytic activity of numerous other proteases.",

Subsequently, in addition to their non-specific degradative function, a role for proteases in catalyzing a substrate-specific proteolytic cleavage resulting in the production of new protein products has become appreciated [2] . There is hardly a signaling process in a living cell that is not associated with protease activity in one way or another. Besides regulating the localization and activity of proteins, proteases create new bioactive molecules as well as generate, transduce, and amplify cellular signals through modulation of protein-protein interactions [3] . Thus proteases regulate multiple biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis, DNA replication and transcription, tissue morphogenesis and remodeling, autophagy, apoptosis, etc. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Considering the multitude of cellular functions performed by proteases, it is no surprise that alterations in proteolytic systems occur during several pathological conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases.",

Apoptosis can be activated extrinsically through the activation of cell surface death receptors like TNF-\u03b1 or intrinsically through mitochondria-mediated release of cytochrome c. Irrespective of extrinsically or intrinsically activated apoptosis, the two pathways converge on activation of terminal, effector caspases, culminating in cell death [12] . Caspases are a family of cysteine-aspartic proteases that drive the process of apoptosis by cleaving essential proteins and thus dismantling the unwanted or damaged cell [13] . Caspases 3 and 7 are effector caspases that are activated in response to initiator caspases, caspases 8 and 9, which are activated in response to an extrinsic or intrinsic signal, respectively [13, 14] . Caspase 3/7 activation is used as a surrogate marker for apoptosis [15, 16] . Activation of the proteolytic activity of Caspase 3/7 has been used to design assays to interrogate the initiation of apoptosis and its deregulation in cancer [17, 18] .",

At the cellular level, this light can be captured and detected using an extremely sensitive cooled chargecoupled device (CCD) camera or a photomultiplier. With the current advancement of instrumentation, bioluminescence imaging can be used to carry out real-time functional imaging of biological processes like protein-protein interactions, kinase activities, cellular trafficking, disease progression and response to therapy, etc. [21] . This is achieved by using a reporter gene that is genetically engineered and encodes the light-generating enzyme luciferase in a form such that its catalytic activity is modulated in context of a protein modifying activity (e.g., protease or a kinase). In the presence of a substrate, luciferase-expressing cells emit a blue to yellowgreen light with an emission spectra peaking at a wavelength between 490 and 620 nm. This noninvasive imaging modality is extremely sensitive over a broad dynamic range with an exceptionally large signal-to-noise ratio. Presently, more than 30 luciferaseluciferin systems are known, but the most frequently used luciferase for in vivo molecular imaging is the ATP-dependent firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase [19] . The main advantage of using firefly luciferase is the high signal-to-noise ratio as 30% of the light produced by firefly luciferase has an emission spectrum above 600 nm, a region with the least amount of signal attenuation due to absorbing and scattering properties of live mammalian tissue [19] . More recently, a smaller but very bright luciferase NanoLuc from deep sea shrimp (Oplophorus gracilirostris) has been successfully engineered [22] . NanoLuc uses a new substrate to produce light which is 100-fold brighter than that of firefly luciferase [23] .",

This reporter, called as ANLucBCLuc, comprised of a fusion of two small interacting peptides, peptide A and peptide B, with NLuc and CLuc fragments of luciferase on their N terminals, respectively, with an intervening Caspase-3 cleavage site (DEVD) between pepANLuc (ANLuc) and pepB-CLuc (BCLuc) [31] . In response to apoptosis, activated Caspase 3 cleaves the engineered reporter, enabling dissociation of ANLuc from BCLuc and thus facilitating the high-affinity interaction between peptide A and peptide B. This interaction restores luciferase enzymatic activity by NLuc and CLuc complementation resulting in the generation of light in the presence of substrate, luciferin [31] . The reporter was found to be very useful in vivo but had limitations in high-throughput screens in vitro due to its significant background signal. Continuing our efforts to develop an effective and highly sensitive imaging reporter for Caspase 3/7 activity, we utilized recent advances in biosensor research including circularly permuted forms of firefly luciferase and thermostable Photinus pyralis luciferases [32] [33] [34] . In collaboration with Promega Corporation, we screened a library of randomly mutated thermally stable luciferase constructs permuted at residue 358 and found a reporter with >50-fold induction of bioluminescence activity following stimulation. The reporter has been further engineered such that the magnitude of the luminescence increase is directly proportional to the amount of analyte or protease activity present and has been made commercially available as GloSensor\u2122 luciferase [35] . This reporter has been used by several investigators to generate biosensors for the activity of various other proteases. Li et al. used the GloSensor technology to develop biosensors for the proteolytic activity of granzyme B/Caspase 8 and used it in combination with the Caspase 3/7 reporter to examine the distinct pattern of caspase activation cascade induced by granzyme B vs Fas [36] . Kilianski et al. utilized the GloSensor reporter to develop reporters for imaging the activity of papain-like protease and chymotrypsinlike protease [37] . These reporters were then used to identify potential inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [37] . These studies exemplify a wide applicability of this powerful technology to image the activity of many specific and regulated proteases.",
