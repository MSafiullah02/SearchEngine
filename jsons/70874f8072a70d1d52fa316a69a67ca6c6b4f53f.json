[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The postmortem investigation and subsequent medical expertise in such fatalities often concentrate on a specific mode or portal of entry of microorganisms, respectively. Most of these cases are investigated against the background of an allegation of medical malpractice, nursing injury, or neglect, most often raised by close relatives of the deceased. In other, more rare instances, the accusation focuses on (grievous) bodily harm.",

            "text": "In the clinicopathologic field with regard to fatalities occurring in-hospital, in at least in a relevant proportion of cases there often is acceptable evidence of an underlying infectious condition in a deceased prior to death, based upon the medical history and results of diagnostic procedures preceding death. Furthermore, there usually is good interdisciplinary communication between the physicians who cared for the deceased and the clinical pathologist performing the autopsy. The latter can make use of this communication to obtain additional information on the clinical course before starting with the postmortem examination. In sepsis-related fatalities of inpatients, the primary task of the clinical autopsy and the following investigations is not initially to establish the primary diagnosis of sepsis at autopsy but rather to obtain feedback on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, to search for underlying disease processes that could have been overlooked but nonetheless contributed to the onset of sepsis and fatal outcome, to verify a suspected or to uncover an uncontrolled focus of sepsis, and to demonstrate pyemic abscess formations or superinfection. In contrast, the postmortem diagnosis of sepsis is by far more difficult to establish in forensic pathology. In the majority of forensic autopsy cases, clear-cut information about the circumstances of death often is not available. Data on the medical history and the clinical course of a deceased or an individual's symptoms prior to death often are not reported or are not available at the time of autopsy, especially in outpatient fatalities. Similar difficulties may arise for the forensic pathologist in cases where the fatality occurred abroad, the patient was in no condition to give a history at admission, and/or the duration of hospital stay before death was too short to reveal any relevant diagnostic findings. Therefore, in a great number of fatalities there is hardly any valuable clinical information available for the forensic pathologist at the time of autopsy. Even in later phases of the postmortem investigation of death of individuals hospitalized for a longer period antemortem, problems can arise when the hospital/institutional documentation contains incomplete data on the deceased's clinical course. [1] [2] [3] During the course of the medicolegal investigation, clinical expertise may be necessary to interpret the clinical data against the background of autopsy findings, histopathology, postmortem microbiologic results, and further analytical workups. All findings brought to light by the postmortem investigation may become evidence in later trial proceedings, and the forensic pathologist may testify as an expert witness against the deceased's physicians. Consequently, any personal or nonauthorized communication between the forensic pathologist and the deceased's physicians must be strictly avoided.",

Therefore, the pathologist may have to decide on the value of obtaining samples for postmortem microbiologic investigations at autopsy. Although the diagnostic value of postmortem microbiology for the diagnosis of antemortem infection has been discussed controversially for decades, the literature is replete with examples demonstrating the importance of such investigations. 26 Postmortem microbiologic investigations have been successfully applied not only to the autopsy diagnosis of infection but also to a broad variety of epidemiologic subjects, such as evaluation of different bacterial, fungal, and viral species in contrastive autopsy populations 17, 19, 27, 28 and drug-abuse related infections, 29, 30 and to a number of divergent forensic questions such as proof of fatal food poisoning with respect to criminal offenses against hygiene regulations, 31,32 etiopathogenetic proof of fatal catheter-related infection, 1,33 and differential diagnosis between cutaneous hemorrhages as a result of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome versus their origin from physical child abuse. 34 Despite advances in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology, the use of conventional microbiologic cultures for postmortem diagnosis of bacterial infection is still efficient. Advantages include easy access and high cost-effectiveness compared to DNA techniques. However, DNA technology may become indispensable in later stages of the medicolegal investigation for specific questions, for example, when subspecification of bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction primers targeting bacterial gene sequences, with the aim of allocating a respective microorganism toward its origin, is needed. Polymerase chain reaction methods, supplemented by immunohistochemistry, are frequently applied for the detection of viruses in forensic autopsy cases, usually on postmortem lung or myocardial specimens. [35] [36] [37] [38] In addition to their potential value for the medicolegal expertise concerning etiopathogenetic conclusions, postmortem microbiologic investigations can be of clinical relevance with respect to epidemiologic considerations related to hospitalacquired (nosocomial) infections.",

In brief, after the thoracic and abdominal cavity is opened and prior to evisceration, the surface of the organ from which the swab will be collected is seared in situ with a red-hot spatula, the prepared section is lanced, and a swab or a sterile needle for aspiration with a syringe is introduced for sampling. This method is widely accepted as the method of choice (\"gold standard\"). [40] [41] [42] Other techniques, such as the \"closed chest\" method in which the specimen is obtained prior to opening of the thoracic cavity through the closed chest wall with a syringe 43 or modified surgical techniques using aseptic procedures, 44 have not had any particular impact on autopsy practice. However, in any technique used, special precaution is necessary to avoid contamination with body fluids on the surface of the organs chosen for specimen sampling. The swab or aspirate should be inoculated into a transport media or culture media immediately after collection to avoid contamination in the autopsy room or failure of survival of microorganisms.",

For specific questions (e.g., infection of the neurocranium), cerebrospinal fluid can be obtained by aspiration through the foramen magnum. In cases of meningitis, collecting smears directly from the brain surface immediately after the head cavity is opened has proved effective. 45 The most promising media for postmortem bacteriologic cultures are spleen and heart blood. 41, 46 Lung cultures are the most difficult specimens to interpret in autopsy bacteriology. The results are widely accepted to be unreliable because of frequent false-positive cultures. About half of the swabs obtained from the lungs at autopsy grow bacteria without clinical or (histo)pathologic evidence of infection. The most obvious reason for this finding is the drainage of saliva into the lungs after death. As early as 1905, Norris and Pappenheimer 47 demonstrated that bacteria placed in the mouth of human cadavers can be detected in the lungs in approximately 50% of the cases at postmortem examination. Concerning the results of postmortem lung cultures, particularly the decision regarding which bacteria cultured represent true respiratory tract infections, commensalism without pathogenetic effect or pure postmortem growth is occasionally beyond the bounds of possibility based only upon outcome of autopsy bacteriology. All results obtained must be supplemented by microscopic investigations. Especially in inpatient fatalities, the possible colonization of the respiratory tract by the patient's oropharyngeal flora and the changing intraindividual pattern of microorganisms to nosocomial flora without true infection in hospitalized patients 48-50 must be considered carefully.",

For example, the culture results may indicate the infectious agent gained access to the intracranial compartment as a result of a previous iatrogenic procedure, such as a neurosurgical operation, or even as a result of a minor traumatic event that occurred prior to death. 13 Postmortem bacteriology can provide valuable information regarding hospitalacquired infections as an additional indicator of nosocomial microorganisms within a specific hospital environment. 26, 28, 55, 56 Sepsis Human sepsis is a spectrum of pathophysiologic changes in the host system resulting from a generalized activation and systemic expression of the host's inflammatory pathways in response to infection. Normally, proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8, are released in response to infection, injury, and/or ischemia, to eliminate pathogens and to promote wound healing. This response then is down-regulated by the release of antiinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra , IL-10), resulting in restoration of homeostasis. In sepsis, however, local defense mechanisms are insufficient to eliminate the infectious agent, and overstimulation of the host's immune effector cells occurs. This overwhelming systemic proinflammatory reaction frequently is followed by an overactive compensatory antiinflammatory mediator release. The severity of sepsis is proportional to the intensity of the host's immune and metabolic response to infection. When the balance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory response is lost, immunologic imbalance and massive systemic inflammation result. [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] Sepsis occurs in approximately 1% of all hospital inpatients and accounts for 20% to 30% of intensive care unit admissions. Despite modern techniques of resuscitation and organ support, septic shock continues to have a mortality rate of approximately 50%.",

Three primary mechanisms that promote bacterial translocation in sepsis have been identified: intestinal bacterial overgrowth, increased permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier, and deficiencies in host immune defenses. Migration of organisms across the bowel wall may occur by pinocytosis in epithelial cells. This mechanism has been proposed as the principal factor for translocation in the presence of an intact mucosal barrier. However, many studies have identified alterations in intestinal permeability in critically ill patients. Under normal circumstances, bacteria reaching the mesenteric lymph nodes are phagocytosed by macrophages, but in immunocompromised septic individuals the normal defense mechanisms fail, permitting bacteria access to distant extraintestinal sites. 77,78 Therefore, heart and spleen blood obtained at autopsy from septic individuals often show polymicrobial culture growth of bowel flora.",

Nevertheless, the detection of diverse potentially sepsis-induced pathologic alterations by routine histologic examination can be considered characteristic to a certain degree within the framework of the entire case history and therefore may add relevant information to the postmortem elucidation of potentially sepsis-related fatalities.",

            "text": "Besides the spleen, the liver plays a central role in the resolution of bacteria that enter the bloodstream. Kupffer cells constitute the first macrophage population to come in contact with bacteria, bacterial endotoxin, and microbial debris from the gut transported to the liver via the portal vein. Kupffer cells constitute the largest compartment of tissue macrophages, representing 80% to 90% of total, fixed macrophages. They reside within the lumen of liver sinusoids and represent approximately 35% of the nonparenchymal liver cells. Enlargement of Disse spaces with swelling of Kupffer cells is a common finding in the septic liver; however, this finding may be masked by autolytic changes. For a long time, phagocytosis of bacteria and their products by Kupffer cells (Figure 3 .20) was considered the principal mechanism for elimination of organisms entering the liver circulation. However, evidence now suggests that the actual mechanism for eliminating bacteria taken up by the liver is dependent on a complex interaction of Kupffer cells and neutrophils, the latter accumulating in the liver sinusoids in endotoxemia and sepsis. 93 Kupffer and endothelial cells contribute to the proinflammatory response of the liver through the release of different mediators, thereby inducing immigration of neutrophils into the liver. Experiments indicate that immigrating neutrophils account for a large proportion of the bactericidal activity expressed in the liver during the course of infection. 94 Although neutrophils constitute only 1% to 2% of nonparenchymal cells in nonseptic individuals, a dramatic 10-to 20-fold increase in neutrophils occurs within hours after onset of sepsis. Therefore, especially in acute septic shock, extensive accumulation of neutrophils (leukostasis) in the liver sinusoids is regarded a characteristic histologic finding 92 and a distinguishing feature of endotoxemia by some authors. 93 Leukocytic infiltration of the acinocentral areas (Figure 3 .21) has been described as an infrequent finding in the liver in sepsis. 95, 96 Cholestasis, occurring without demonstrable extrahepatic obstruction, is a common finding in the septic liver.",

The cut surface shows a soft and hyperemic parenchyma with a reddish-gray, sometimes muddybrown appearance. At gross examination, the pathologist's attention should also focus on the splenic vein, because septic thrombophlebitis of this vessel can cause pyelophlebitic liver abscesses either by per continuitatem spread or via the hematogenous route. The term acute splenitis (\"septic spleen\") refers to a soft, runny consistency of the splenic pulp draining from cut sections, histologically corresponding to an increased number of neutrophils and macrophages. The concept of acute splenitis as a postmortem marker of systemic infection is generally accepted, and in my experience it is the most frequent finding in sepsis-related fatalities, seen in more than 90% of cases. However, a study (investigating only a small number of cases) questioned the association of acute splenitis with sepsis, but the authors admitted that the presence of acute splenitis may be useful in distinctive sepsis cases with specific subsets of microbial infections or patient (newborn vs. adult) populations. 97 Septicopyemic abscesses in considerable sizes were a frequent finding in the preantibiotic era but now are rare. However, various exogenous or endogenous factors, such as inappropriate or lack of specific antibiotic use, immunocompromise as the result of a severe underlying debilitating illness (e.g., malignant disease, metabolic disorder, immunodeficiency), or concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive agents prior to death, still may present as septicopyemic abscesses in the spleen.",

Histologically, clostridial myonecrosis is characterized by Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria invading emptied sarcolemma and homogenization of adjacent muscle fibers with loss of nuclei. The histologic picture is remarkable for its absence of almost any inflammatory cell reaction next to clusters of clostridia ( Figure 3.38) , a picture distinctly different from all other forms of bacterial infections. Two reasons can be put forward to explain this phenomenon: (1) various extracellular toxins produced by clostridia, such as phospholipase C and Pyomyositis (primary muscle abscess) is an acute bacterial infection of the skeletal musculature. Staphylococcus aureus is the organism most commonly cultured from the abscess; it is seen in up to 90% of cases in tropical areas and 75% of cases in temperate countries. Group A streptococcus accounts for another 1% to 5% of cases. The term pyomyositis should be restricted to primary muscle abscesses arising within the skeletal musculature and should not be used to describe (1) intermuscular abscesses, (2) abscesses extending into muscles from adjoining tissues, such as bone or subcutaneous tissues, or (3) pyemic intramuscular abscesses secondary to previous sepsis. Fatal cases of pyomyositis seen in the forensic pathologic setting usually arise from a preceding trauma, such as a fall or assault. 10 Intravenous drug abuse is another important risk factor for pyomyositis. 10 The factors responsible are impaired cellular and humoral immunity, defective bactericidal capacity of neutrophils, increased bacterial colonization of skin, and direct injection of contaminated materials. Pyomyositis is increasingly documented in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mechanisms include muscle damage caused by HIV infection per se, zidovudine therapy, and infections caused by parasites and mycobacteria leading to impaired host defenses. 111, 112 Abscess formations due to pyomyositis are characterized by extensive suppuration on cut sections. They are most often located in the thigh gluteal muscles but also involve muscles around the shoulder girdle, abdomen, pelvis, and around the spine. Histologic features of pyomyositis include Grampositive cocci infiltration with surrounding granulocytic infiltration, edematous separation of fibers in early stages of the disease followed by patchy myocytolysis progressing to disruption of muscle fibers, and complete disintegration of the affected muscle (Figure 3.39) .",

Necrotizing fasciitis results from introduction of pathogens into injured or devitalized tissue and is most commonly associated with surgical procedures.

Entry of leukocytes into sites of injury or infection requires molecular mechanisms that enable the leukocyte to recognize the sites from within the vasculature and to come in contact with the vessel-lining endothelium in order to perform diapedesis through the vessel wall. Recognition and contact formation with the endothelium are dependent on the presence of both cytokines and adhesion molecules that mediate neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesive interactions. During sepsis, the lung is especially susceptible to injury, and a critically impaired lung function often leads to ARDS and death in the septic individual.

This selectin-mediated adherence of leukocytes to the blood vessel wall first leads to rolling of leukocytes within the bloodstream on the endothelial cell surface. The rolling leukocytes are able to sense signals from the endothelium, which stimulate them to adhere firmly to its surface. Stimulated by cytokines, leukocytic integrins bind to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on the endothelial cell surface. Firm adhesion via activated integrins is a prerequisite for leukocyte diapedesis through the layer of the endothelial cells. Little is known about the exact mechanism of diapedesis, namely, whether the leukocytes transmigrate through the junctions between adjacent endothelial cells or directly through a single endothelial cell. 126",

A clinicopathologic autopsy study confirmed these results by demonstrating up-regulation of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in sepsis-induced lung injury in intensive care unit patients who died of septic shock as a result of infection with Gram-negative bacteria. 139 Accordingly, E-selectin, VLA-4, and ICAM-1 should be considered useful immunohistochemical postmortem markers of sepsis. Use of the presented immunohistochemical markers of sepsis-induced lung injury will be particularly helpful when autopsy findings and routine histology in cases of suspected fatal sepsis are unspecific or unconvincing, respectively. However, no single marker should be relied upon to establish the diagnosis of sepsis postmortem because such a practice may lead to misinterpretation and false conclusions. As a routine test, the immunohistochemical detection of cellular adhesion molecules is far from established in forensic autopsy practice.

These and other risk factors must be considered carefully in the concluding medicolegal expertise in light of the fatality in question. From the clinical point of view, a number of sudden, unexpected deaths occurring outside the hospital as the result of a rapidly progressive course of infection should be regarded as unavoidable.

Next, the question of whether inoculation of microorganisms through the established portal of entry could have been avoided in all probability if the responsible medical staff had acted lege artis (e.g., in view of hygiene regulations), and therefore whether death as a result of infection can be ascribed to medical or nursing malpractice, will be the main focus of medicolegal interest. 1, 3 In fatalities resulting from WFS in infancy and childhood, the question almost inevitably arises as to whether the child could have been saved if the diagnosis had been made earlier. 9 Especially if a physician was consulted at the beginning of the disease, medical malpractice seems obvious to the parents. Because of the rapid clinical course of the disease and the rather unspecific findings at its beginning, even the clinical professional may not be able to distinguish WFS from a common cold or enteritis. Even if medical help is sought at an early stage of the disease, predicting the outcome in an individual case is impossible. 142 By the time DIC presents, it often is too late to save the child's life.",

The colonization of persistent open decubitus ulcers with microorganisms is connected with infectious complications such as bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and sepsis. 2, 7, 8 Sepsis related to decubitus ulcers is estimated to be associated with a mortality rate of up to 50%. 8 If the deceased required a nursing service or medical care prior to death, the forensic investigator also may be confronted with questions regarding neglect or the existence of an actual nursing injury. In addition, particularly in cases of decubitusassociated fatalities, an iatrogenic origin of the decubitus ulcer or even medical malpractice must be considered. 8 The development of sepsis as a consequence of decubitus formation should be regarded as a nonnatural cause of death when the responsibility for development of the decubitus ulcer can be attributed to neglectful care, incorrect nursing, or medical malpractice. 2, 3, 8 These are just a few examples of the forensic pathologic and medicolegal problems associated with postmortem elucidation of sepsis-related deaths that forensic pathologists encounter in their practical work.",

Apart from the primary task, namely, the medicolegal elucidation of infectionrelated deaths, the forensic pathologist can contribute to the knowledge about the influence of specific pathogenic agents on fatalities that occurred outside of the hospital. Data obtained from such instances are valuable, as infections causing or significantly contributing to deaths of outpatients probably are underestimated.
