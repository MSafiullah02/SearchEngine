Recognition of the process of mitosis dates back over a century, when Pol, Butschli, and Strasburger identified a network of intracellular points and lines, then called the karyokinetic figure, and today known as the mitotic apparatus. This discovery, dating to 1873, laid the foundation for the discovery of chromosomes and, later, the fundamental biologic processes of mitosis and meiosis [1] . But, while cellular growth and proliferation were understood to be essential to the emergence of multicellular organisms , the corollar y -that controlled cell death must be part of this calculus of cellular homeostasis -was not appreciated until quite recently. Although cell death was first described in 1859 by Virchow, it took more than a century to appreciate the importance of programmed cell death as a physiological process that eliminated unwanted cells [2] . The term 'apoptosis' was coined in 1972 by Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie to describe a distinct type of cell death characterized by the degradation of cellular constituents into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies [3] . Since then, recognition of the importance of apoptosis in health and disease, and an understanding of its cellular mechanisms, has increased exponentially.",

Central to this process is the degradation of intracellular proteins by members of a family of intracellular cysteine proteases called caspases, so named because they cleave their target proteins through the recognition of tetrapeptide sequences adjacent to an aspartic acid residue. There are at least 14 caspases in mammals, eleven of which are found in humans; I DNA, Protein cleavage Caspase-3 Fig. 1 . Apoptosis is initiated in a receptor-mediated manner through the extrinsic pathway, or through altered mitochondrial permeability via the intrinsic pathway. Activation of either results in the assembly of macromolecular complexes that lead to initiator caspase activation, and, in turn, to the activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3. This process can be inhibited by intracellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and the action of these, in turn, can be blocked by proteins such as SmaclDIABLO. See text for details. IntrinsicPathway ExtrinsicPathway seven of these have important established roles in apoptosis [6] . The caspase family can be further subdivided into initiator caspases that trigger the apoptotic cascade, and effector caspases responsible for enzymatic cleavage of a range of intracellular proteins, ultimately causing cell death [7] . The initiator caspases (primarily caspases-8 and -9, but also including caspases-2, and -10) are characterized by having at least one adaptor domain in their N-terminal region [7] . They are autoactivated and tightly regulated, through the assembly of multi-component complexes [8] . Effector caspases -predominantly caspases-3, -6, and -7 -contain prodomains that are activated by an initiator caspase through cleavage at specific aspartate residues.",

Alterations in mitochondrial transmembrane potential trigger the release, from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm, of proteins including cytochrome C, Smac/DIABLO, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), endonuclease G (EndoG), and Omi/HtrA2 [9] . The actions of the pro-apoptotic protein, cytochrome C, are best characterized, Cytochrome C binds to apoptotic protease activating factor (APAF)-l in the cytoplasm, inducing a conformational change that permits the binding of ATP/dATP to APAF-l, and recruiting pro-caspase-9 to create a multi-protein complex termed the apoptosome. Formation of the apoptosome results in the cleavage of pro-caspase-9, releasing activated caspase-9, and so triggering the apoptotic process, with activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 [7, 10] . Other mitochondrial proteins such as Smac/DIABLO or Omi/HtrA2, released by changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, support the progression of apoptosis by blocking the activity of inhibitory proteins of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (lAP) family.",

            "text": "The extrinsic pathway is activated by the binding of an extracellular death ligand to its cell-surface death receptor. Death ligands, such as FasL and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interact with their receptors as homotrimers (complexes of three identical proteins), and so result in the clustering of three corresponding receptors, for example Fas (CD95) or the TNF-a receptor 1 (TNFRl), respectively. Each death receptor is a transmembrane protein that contains a cytoplasmic death domain that connects the components of the apoptotic pathway intracellularly [11] . The association of receptor death domains induces recruitment of additional adaptor proteins that also contain death domains . Activated Fas receptor recruits Fas-associated death doma in (FADD), which, in addition to containing a death domain , also has a death effector domain (DED); the DED on FADD recruits and binds caspase-8. The resultant Fas/FADD/caspase-8 protein complex, termed the death -inducing signaling complex (DISC), leads to autocleavage and activation of caspase-8 [12] , and, in turn, cleavage and activation of the effector caspase, caspase-3 [7] . TNF-a binding to TNFR1 also leads to receptor trimerization and the recruitment and binding of TNFR-associated DD-containing proteins (TRADDs) through their death domains. Like FADD, TRADD can recruit and activate caspase-8, activating caspase-3 and inducing apoptosis . However, TRADD can also associate with secondary adaptor molecules that include TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and receptor -interacting protein (RIP): This interaction results in activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) and activator protein (AP)-l [13, 14] , that promote the transcription ofIAP family members [15] . Thus, TNF-a can subserve the contradictory roles of inducing or inhibit ing apoptosis -the actual biologic activity resulting from TNFR engagement being dependent on poorly understood accessory signals accompanying receptor engagement (11) .",

Pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bax, Bad, Bak, Bid, and Bik, can be further subdivided on the basis of having only a BH3 domain, and so requiring assistance from pro-apoptotic members containing multiple BH domains in order to induce apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 prote ins regulate the formation of large openings in the mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing for the release of intramembrane space proteins and the induction of apoptosis (18) . Bcl-2, the initial member of this family to be identified, was isolated as a protein over-expressed in lymphocytes from a patient with a B cell lymphoma. Although the precise mechanism through which Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis is unknown, it has been proposed that its activity arises through its capacity to block cytochrome C release, and to decrease Ca 2 + sensitivity of the mitochondrial pore opening (19) . Other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, such as Bcl-2 and Bel-xi, may bind and sequester pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Bax, Bak, and Bid, through a hydrophobic cleft. Other anti-apo-ptotic proteins related to the Bcl-2 family, including Mel-I and AI, lack a protein domain necessary for interactions with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Mel-I is found primarily in hematopoietic cells and exhibits rapid turnover; thus, protection from apoptosis is short-lived [20] . Little is known about the mechanism of action of Mel-I or AI, or about the specific protein targets with which they interact.",

Caspase-9 is inhibited primarily by XIAP, which also inhibits caspase-3 and -7; the latter caspases may also be inhibited by clAP-I, clAP-2, and NAIP. All lAPs contain at least one baculoviral repeat (BIR) domain, although each BIR domain may be responsible for distinct functions. XIAP inhibits activated caspase-9 through its third BIR domain, while caspase-3 and -7 are targeted by a region between its first two BIR domains [7] . The mechanism of caspase-9 inhibition appears to involve heterodimerization with monomeric caspase-9, preventing apoptosome formation and caspase-9 autoactivation [21] . Inhibition of the effector caspases-3 and -7 by XIAP occurs through a linker peptide preceding its second BIR domain. This peptide occupies the active site of caspase-3 or -7 and serves to block substrate contact [7] .",

For example, Smac/DIABLO released from mitochondria during activation of the intrinsic pathway contributes towards apoptosome formation, leading to activation of caspase-9, a process inhibited by XIAP. Binding of XIAP to caspase-9 occurs through an lAP-binding tetrapeptide motif on caspase-9 that allows for recruitment of XIAP and inhibition of caspase-9 activity. SmaclDIA-BLO possesses a similar lAP-binding tetrapeptide motif that can bind to the BIR3 domain of XIAP, and so restore caspase-9 activation [7] .",

Although loss of muscle mass has been ascribed to accelerated protein breakdown due to systemic catabolism, myocyte apoptosis also appears to be a contributing factor. Following burn injury, apoptosis is accelerated in muscles located both adjacent to, and distant from, the burn site [26] .",

            "text": "Neutrophils are key effectors of the innate immune response to infection. Their migration to sites of infection occurs early in order to eliminate pathogens through phagocytosis and the production of toxic mediators. In the absence of pro-surv ival stimuli from the inflammatory microenvironment, neutrophils are constitutively apoptotic, with a circulating lifespan of 8-20 hours. However multiple stimuli -of both microbial and host origin -can subvert this process, and prolong the functional survival of the neutrophil ( Table 1 ). The normal expression of apoptosis and clearance of neutrophils from sites of inflammation is important in minimizing inadvertent bystander injury secondary to the release of neutrophil cytotoxic intracellular contents, as occurs during death by necrosis. Neutrophil longevity thus reflects a crucial balance between survival to fight infection and timely death to prevent collateral tissue damage. Additionally, neutrophil apoptosis must be regulated Fig. 2 . Whereas neutrophils harvested from healthy volunteers undergo spontaneous apoptosis following 24 hours of in vitro culture, this process is inhibited following culture with bacterial LPS, and further suppressed in circulating neutrophils from critically ill septic patients. Adapted from [38] carefully in order to maintain appropriate numbers within the body, since approximately 10\" neutrophils are produced daily by healthy adults [11, 35) .",

The intracellular activities of steroids are complex, and glucocorticoids can affect the expression of the same genes in opposite ways, depending on the tissue and biologic context [43] .
