Other clinical findings involve the musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system and genitourinary tract. Treatment in the acute phase aims to reduce inflammation in the coronary artery wall and prevent coronary thrombosis. Long-term therapy is aimed at prevention of myocardial ischemia or infarction. 1 The term 'incomplete KD' is used when the patient lacks sufficient clinical signs to complete the criteria for classic KD. Patients with fever of at least 5 days and two to three clinical features should have inflammatory markers, CRP and ESR, done. If both are raised, further supplemental tests should be performed. Positive supplementary laboratory criteria include albumin of \u22643 g/dL, anaemia for age, elevation of alanine aminotransferase, platelets after five days of \u2265450 000/mm 3 , WCC of \u226515 000/mm 3 and urine of \u226510 WCC/hpf. Those with at least three supplemental criteria can be treated before undergoing an echocardiogram. Those with less than three positive criteria should undergo echocardiogram and if positive, receive treatment. 1 Treatment should be given to children within 10 days of fever onset and those beyond day 10 with clinical and laboratory signs of ongoing inflammation. 1 Our case was managed as possible incomplete KD based on 12 days of fever with clinical features of non-purulent conjunctivitis and cervical lymphadenopathy. He also had anaemia, elevated WCC, and raised inflammatory markers. He was started on treatment prior to his echocardiogram.",

            "text": "The presence of a limp, bilateral hip effusions with raised WCC and inflammatory markers initially directed the management towards septic arthritis however it needs to be noted that symptoms of arthritis and irritability manifested by our patient are commonly seen in patients with KD. 1, 2 The persistence of fever despite 3 days of intravenous antibiotics and sterile joint fluid must lead to consideration of the diagnosis of KD. A similar case report described a 3-year-old girl who was febrile for 4 days but afebrile for 3 days prior to her presentation with a limp. Ultrasound showed small bilateral hip effusions. She had conjunctival injection and erythematous, dry lips. Laboratory results showed raised WCC, platelets and CRP. Her echocardiogram findings were consistent with KD resulting in her treatment with IVIG and aspirin. 3 Historically, arthritis was a common component of KD but its prevalence and symptom duration has decreased with the advent of early IVIG treatment. 4, 5 A further association of arthritis and KD is reported with patients who presented with arthritis after defervescence of fever with IVIG. Their arthritis responded to high doses of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen or corticosteroids. Arthritis occurred regardless of high dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy in the subacute stage and after high dose IVIG therapy suggesting that this is a reactive arthritis due to an unknown pathogen. 6 Systemic-onset juvenile arthritis is a differential diagnosis for this presentation. It is a multifactorial autoinflammatory condition characterised by fever for more than 2 weeks, an evanescent maculopapular rash and secondary arthritis. Cardiac complications have also been noted, most frequently myocarditis and pericarditis, but there have been case reports of coronary artery dilatation and thrombus. To differentiate KD from systemic-onset juvenile arthritis, Lefevre-Utile et al. suggested that the latter had mild coronary changes including limited dilatation rather than true aneurysms. In addition, children with SoJIA do not respond to IVIG therapy but rather require high dose of steroids for fever defervescence. Children with SoJIA and coronary artery abnormalities required high dose steroids, were steroid dependant and had poor prognosis. 7 The presentation of our 2-year-old boy with fever of more than 5 days with a non-traumatic limp illustrates the importance of considering KD in paediatric patients with unexplained prolonged or a fever not responding to appropriate management for presumed cause. An early echocardiogram facilitates early treatment resulting in limiting the morbidity and mortality of cardiac complications of KD.",

Coronary artery changes are the major sequelae in KD. Cardiac imaging is a critical investigation for this condition. Echocardiography is the ideal imaging for cardiac assessment because it is non-invasive and has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of abnormalities of the proximal left main coronary artery and right coronary artery. 1 2 In which of these scenarios would you decide to treat with IVIG? a) Five-year-old boy with fever of 6 days, polymorphous generalised rashes for the first 2 days of fever, swelling of hands and feet, non-exudative conjunctivitis, and strawberry tongue. He has WCC of 18 \u00d7 10 9 /L with neutrophilic predominance and platelets of 500 \u00d7 10 9 /L b) Two-year-old girl with fever for 10 days, sterile blood, urine and CSF cultures and rising WCC and inflammatory markers without improvement on antibiotics and noted to have hydrops of the gallbladder on ultrasound c) Eight-year old with fever and cough for 8 days without improvement after 3 days of oral antibiotics, normal chest x-ray, sterile blood culture and sterile pyuria, rising WCC and CRP, platelets of 650 \u00d7 10 9 /L d) Seven-year old with fever for 12 days without focus, sterile blood culture, haemoglobin of 100 g/L, WCC of 23 \u00d7 10 9 /L, CRP of 200, ESR 90 and coronary artery aneurysm on echocardiogram e) All of the above Answer: e.
