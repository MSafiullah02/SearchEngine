With inhomogeneous physical systems in mind, but also anticipating interdisciplinary applications, we present the model on network structures of varying degrees of complexity. We solve it for the generic case of power-law spin strength and find that, with a self-averaging free energy, the model has a rich phase diagram with new universality classes. Indeed, the degree of complexity added by variable spins is on a par to that added by endowing simple networks with increasingly realistic geometries. It is suitable for modeling emergent phenomena in many-body systems in contexts where non-identicality of spins or agents plays an essential role and for exporting statistical physics concepts beyond physics.",

Lenz (1) and solved in one dimension with nearest-neighbor interactions by E. Ising (2, 3) . It draws on works of R. Kirwan and W. Weber (4, 5) who proposed that vanishing magnetization of macroscopic para-and ferromagnetic bodies originates from random disordering of identical elementary magnets (spins) at microscopic levels. While their ideas also explained magnetic saturation in strong external fields, they failed to explain gradual response to weak ones. E.A. Ewing (6) introduced interactions to mend this shortcoming and P. Weiss (7) used the idea in the mean-field approximation. The IM itself sits between the Kirwan-Weber non-interacting picture and the Curie-Weiss maximally interacting one and manifests spontaneous spin alignment as well. Yet it is its simplicity, coupled with the phenomenon of universality, that lies behind its applicability to many real-world many-body phenomena in physics and beyond (8) .",
