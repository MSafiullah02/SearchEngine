We now show Msi1 expression in a subset of oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) cells in white matter areas temporally and spatially associated with oligodendrogenesis in the postnatal CNS. Msi1 function was evaluated by infection of OP cells with retroviral transduction of Msi1 or knockdown of endogenous Msi1. Retroviral expression of Msi1 significantly reduced the proportion of mature oligodendrocytes generated from OP cells in vitro and in vivo during myelination. Msi1 transduction also promoted OP survival, particularly under conditions of challenge from oxidative stress, while Msi1 siRNA knockdown resulted in dramatic OP cell death. Furthermore, in experimental demyelination Msi1 expression was increased among cells associated with lesions, including OP cells, indicating a potential role in the generation of remyelinating oligodendrocytes.

            "text": "Along with transcription factors, several classes of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins control neural cell specification and differentiation through post-transcriptional regulation. The Elav family, which includes the vertebrate Hu proteins, appears to function in the survival and differentiation of neurons (Akamatsu et al., 1999; Okano and Darnell, 1997) . The quaking family of RNA-binding proteins has primarily been identified in glial progenitors and oligodendrocytes; expression of several alternatively spliced isoforms coincides with the development of oligodendrocytes and the onset of myelination (Ebersole et al., 1996; Hardy, 1998; Lu et al., 2003) . The Musashi (Msi) family is preferentially expressed in CNS stem cells and appears to maintain these cells in an undifferentiated state (Kaneko et al., 2000; Okano et al., 2005; Sakakibara et al., 1996) , although differential expression of Msi1 may regulate cell fate decisions in the postnatal brain. In neonatal mice, multipotent cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and cells of the astrocyte lineage express Msi1, but postmitotic neurons and mature oligodendrocytes do not express Msi1 (Sakakibara et al., 1996; Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) , suggesting that differentiation along neuronal and oligodendrocyte lineages may require Msi1 downregulation.",

Olig2 is present in nuclei at all stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage and in a small subset of progenitor cells in the postnatal SVZ (Ligon et al., 2006; Menn et al., 2006) . Immunostaining for Msi1 and Olig2 showed a high density of Msi11 cells in SVZ, with a subset of Msi11 cells also immunoreactive for Olig2 (Fig. 1D ). Similar populations were observed in the subcallosal zone (SCZ), an extensive paraventricular region located between the hippocampus and CC that gives rise to oligodendrocytes postnatally (Seri et al., 2006 )(Supplemental Fig. 1 ). The CC also contained Msi11 Olig21 cells (Figs. 1D-E). The Msi11 Olig21 cells in the CC adjacent to the SVZ or SCZ were often small, round cell bodies with rudimentary processes (Fig. 1D) , similar to the cells within the SVZ. The Msi11 Olig21 double-labeled cells found elsewhere in the CC usually had elongated cell bodies with processes ( Fig. 1E) , although some small, round Msi11 Olig21 cells were also detected and usually appeared in pairs suggesting recent cell division (Fig. 1E, inset) . In addition to these morphological indications that Msi11 cells reflected an immature cell stage among the Olig21 population, the preferential localization of Msi11 Olig21 cells near germinal zones supported this interpretation. The density of Msi11 Olig21 double-labeled cells was significantly higher in the regions of the CC near the SVZ (lateral CC, under the peaks of the cingulum; 134.30 6 17.64 cells/mm 2 ) than CC regions away from the SVZ (medial CC; 50.57 6 15.27 cells/mm 2 , P 5 0.023; Fig. 1F ). There were no significant differences between CC regions in the density of single-labeled Msi1-expressing cells (Msi11 Olig2-cells, 658.60 6 66.39 cells/mm 2 under peaks of cingulum compared to 543.70 6 120.10 cells/mm 2 in midline, P 5 0.4495) or Olig2-expressing cells (Msi1-Olig21 cells, 1032.00 6 11.34 cells/mm 2 under peaks of cingulum compared to 956.30 6 178.90 cells/mm 2 in midline, P 5 0.6930).",

            "text": "Msi1 can be expressed in immature and differentiated astrocytes and Olig2 may be important in SVZ cell generation of astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes (Marshall et al., 2005; Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) . There-fore, identification of Msi11 cells with Olig2 may not definitively identify cells committed to the oligodendrocyte lineage. However, the Olig21 cells that were double labeled for Msi1 in P7 brain sections did not express detectable glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes (Supplemental Fig. 2) . Furthermore, immunostaining for Sox10, a transcription factor restricted to oligodendrocytes within the CNS (Stolt et al., 2002) , was seen in a subset of Msi11 cells in the postnatal CC adjacent to the SVZ (Supplemental Fig. 3) , providing further support of Msi1 expression associated with oligodendrocyte development. To more specifically assess Msi1 expression in OP cells, coimmunostaining was performed for plateletderived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFaR; Menn et al., 2006; Nishiyama et al., 1996) . A subset of Msi11 cells in the P7 CC coexpressed PDGFaR (Fig. 1G ). Similar to the findings with Olig2, the density of Msi11 PDGFaR 1 cells was significantly higher in the lateral CC near the SVZ (80.57 6 2.40 cells/mm 2 under the peaks of the cingulum) than in the medial CC (31.70 6 1.96 cells/mm 2 , P < 0.0001; Fig. 1I ). As above, there was no significant difference in the density of single-labeled Msi1 expressing cells (i.e. Msi11 PDGFaR-) between the two CC regions (473.90 6 36.46 cells/mm 2 under peaks of cingulum compared to 413.10 6 18.13 cells/mm 2 in midline, P 5 0.21). As expected in correlation with oligodendrogenesis from cells of the SVZ, the lateral CC region adjacent to the SVZ contained significantly more PDGFaR-expressing cells (1129.00 6 10.60 cells/mm 2 under the peaks of the cingulum) than the medial CC (993.10 6 45.69 cells/mm 2 , P 5 0.0444). Among the overall OP population, the Msi11 PDGFaR1 cells appear to be a subpopulation preferentially localized in the white matter near the SVZ. The current focus on early transitional cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage may explain our findings relative to a previous study that did not observe colocalization of Msi in PDGFaR1 OP cells (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) . The correlation of Msi1 with a very early stage of the lineage is also supported by a lack of Msi1 colocalization in NG21 OP cells in both the previous study (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) and current work in P7 mouse CC (Fig. 1H ).",

At P7 within the lumbar dorsal funiculus, myelination of the fasciculus cuneatus is nearing completion while myelination of the more medial fasciculus gracilis is ongoing and the corticospinal tract is not yet myelinated ( Fig. 2A ; Murtie et al., 2005a) . Similar to the results in the developing CC, a subset of Msi11 cells in the dorsal funiculus was immunolabeled for Olig2 ( Fig. 2B) or PDGFaR (Fig. 2C) . The density of Msi11 PDGFaR1 cells was even higher in the dorsal funiculus (216.30 6 31.13 cells/mm 2 ) than in the CC (see above). The density of Msi11 PDGFaR1 cells did not differ significantly between myelinated and unmyelinated regions of the dorsal funiculus (211.20 6 37.89 cells/mm 2 in myelinated region compared to 244.40 6 17.30 cells/mm 2 in unmyelinated region, P 5 0.47).

To test the function of Msi1 in OP cells, we first assessed a role in differentiation within the oligodendrocyte lineage. OP cell cultures were infected with replication-incompetent retrovirus expressing Msi1 followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter (Fig. 4A,B) . Retroviral transduction of the wild-type virus (MsiWT) significantly reduced the proportion of GFP1 cells that differentiated into oligodendrocytes (16.87% 6 0.72%) compared to infection with the control retrovirus, which contained a mutant Msi1 sequence that lacked RNA binding activity (27.42% 6 1.58%; P value <0.0001; Fig. 4C ). The percentage of mature oligodendrocytes seen in OP cultures infected with the control retrovirus was similar to that seen in infection of OP cultures with the empty pMX retroviral vector (Zhou et al., 2006) , demonstrating that infection with the retroviral vector itself or the control retrovirus containing mutated Msi1 does not alter differentiation. These results show that Msi1 transduction inhibits OP differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro.",

Spinal cord from the first mouse injected with each retrovirus was longitudinally sectioned on a vibratome to ensure successful infection of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and expression of GFP (Figs. 5A,B) . For subsequent mice, alternate longitudinal spinal cord sections were immunostained with either CC1 antibody, to identify mature oligodendrocytes (Fuss et al., 2000) (Figs. 5A 0 ,B 0 ) , or NG2 antibody to identify OP cells (Nishiyama et al., 1996) (Figs. 5A 00 ,B 00 ).

Although specific genes regulated by Msi1 are not yet known, the current findings focus the context for Msi1 function in the generation of oligodendrocytes in the postnatal CNS. In the postnatal rodent SVZ, neural stem cells give rise to early stage oligodendrocyte lineage cells that migrate to developing white matter and proliferate to generate a large pool of OP cells. Msi1 expression may act in concert with signals that maintain early oligodendrocyte lineage cells in a relatively undifferentiated state. Msi1 expression may be especially critical during early OP cell migration from the neural stem cell niche prior to interaction with oligodendrocyte survival factors in white matter tracts. Indeed, the current findings directly test a previous correlation of Msi1 expression with cell survival (Kempermann et al., 2006) and extend the potential range of Msi1 from neurogenesis to oligodendrogenesis. Furthermore, the results of the Msi1 in vivo transduction experiments showed that Msi1 expression does not block acquisition of NG2 immunoreactivity but does modulate differentiation of OP cells into mature oligodendrocytes.",

By inhibiting translation of p21 WAF-1 , Msi1 is able to regulate stem cell maintenance (Battelli et al., 2005) . Msi1 binding to p21 WAF-1 may contribute to survival of early oligodendrocyte lineage cells by temporarily inhibiting cell cycle progression. However, later in oligodendrocyte development, Msi1 binding to p21 WAF-1 is unlikely to be the mechanism by which Msi1 inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation since Msi1 overexpression would be expected to enhance proliferation and promote OP differentiation if Msi1 exerted its effect by binding to p21 WAF-1 .",

After a demyelinating episode in the CNS, OP cells proliferate to repopulate the lesioned area and then differentiate to form myelinating oligodendrocytes (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 2005) . OP cells that proliferate in response to demyelination can be identified by expression of PDGFaR (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . This study shows coexpression of Msi1 with both Olig2 and PDGFaR after MHV-induced demyelination in the spinal cord (see Fig. 8 ). Importantly, the density of Msi11 Olig21 cells was significantly higher at the time point when lesions are being repopulated by proliferating OP cells (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . Furthermore, recent work in our lab showed Msi11 cells associated with lesions that were double immunolabeled for myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1) (Vana et al., 2007) . Myt1 is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in normal and demyelinated mouse spinal cord tissues, but is not expressed in astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that a population of Msi11 cells is distinct from reactive astrocytes and is identified with markers (i.e., PDGFaR, Olig2, or Myt1) indicative of early oligodendrocyte lineage cells responding to demyelination. Therefore, Msi1 may have a role in the generation of remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS which may contribute to recovery from diseases with a demyelinating component, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury.",

Embryonic development in Msi1 2/2 mice provided initial clues that Msi1 may function to regulate oligodendrocyte development. The absence of Msi1 had no effect on neurosphere number or self-renewal activity yet fewer clones contained oligodendrocytes. This result suggests that Msi1 expression influences the generation and/or survival of oligodendrocytes in the embryonic CNS. This effect of Msi1 did not require cooperative interaction with Musashi2 (Msi2) nor did Msi2 appear to compensate for this Msi1 2/2 reduced neurosphere multipotency (Sakakibara et al., 2002) . Further research is needed to identify targets of Msi1 RNA-binding targets and to understand the mechanisms by which Msi1 affects OP differentiation and survival. Additional study of Msi1 expression in the OP response to demyelinating diseases may elucidate potential targets for therapeutic interventions to promote the generation of remyelinating oligodendrocytes.",

To knockdown Msi1, OP cell cultures were infected with a replication-incompetent retroviral vector containing a siRNA fragment targeting Msi1 and the ZsGreen reporter. A scrambled nucleotide sequence in the same siRNA cassette was used to generate control retrovirus. A-C: Cultured OP cells infected with control siRNA, fixed and immunostained for cleaved caspase-3 (panel B) and DAPI (panel C) 48 h after infection. The two infected OP cells (ZsGreen1; panel A) are not immunolabeled with caspase-3.
