This was followed by several virtual meetings between the consultants of the CAP for elaboration on the algorithm of the triage during the reception of a call and the management of beneficiaries (see figure 1\n). We solicited the national telephone operator; the result being the installation of a helpline accessible to all citizens free of charge. We also needed to establish the necessary facilities for the operation of the technical assistance centre: for this we resorted to a call center subject to Convention 108 of the protection of the personal data, and which has voluntarily made available essential protective measures (hydroalcoholic gel, mask), logistics and technology. In addition, we solicited the Tunisian institute for rehabilitation NEBRAS for the care of health professionals. A meeting with the Shoc Room and the CAP was held to finalize the procedure of the intervention and discuss the progress of the technicalities",

Depending on the algorithm, they transfer the call to a therapist after verifying their availability. A CAP consultant, who guides them in case of an uncertainty while applying the call triage algorithm, supervises the students. The therapist receiving the call receives in parallel an email containing the information collected by the student. At the end of the intervention, the therapist is invited to fill an intervention sheet which includes: the clinical symptoms, the reason for the call, the psychiatric interview data and the intervention methods such as: social orientation, psychiatric emergencies orientation, referral to the attending psychiatrist, psychoeducation about anxiety, relaxation training, recommendation, if necessary, for parental consultation when the call is concerning their child.

Our country demonstrates widespread telephone accessibility, although the internet is lacking or scarcely used in some regions. Furthermore, the fact that the number is free of charge allows a greater number of distressed people to receive care without having to worry about cost. The centralisation of the calls is also a strong suit of our model; meanwhile several countries have done local or institutionalized interventions (Liu et al., 2020). This aspect was possible due to the ethnic and cultural homogeneity between Tunisian regions as well as help from the health ministry.",
