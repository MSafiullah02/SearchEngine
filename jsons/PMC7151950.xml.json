The most common or important viral infections that may come to the attention of emergency and critical care veterinarians are canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine influenza virus, feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and rabies virus infection. The FIV and FeLV status of all cats should be determined on arrival by questioning the owner or testing using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for FeLV antigen and FIV antibody. Because these infections may be detected in asymptomatic cats, and because some cats may eliminate FeLV, positive test results alone are not reason for euthanasia. CPV infection is covered in the following chapter. Other viral diseases that may present to emergency and critical care veterinarians include enteric viral infections such as rotavirus and coronavirus infections, feline paramyxovirus infection, pseudorabies virus infection, vector-borne viral infections such as West Nile virus infection, infectious canine viral hepatitis, and canine herpesvirus infection.",

Treatment of viral infections is largely supportive and symptomatic and usually includes intravenous fluid therapy, early enteral or parenteral nutrition, antiemetics, analgesia, and oxygen therapy when pulmonary disease is present. Blood products may be needed for cats with retroviral infections. Antibiotics may be needed for secondary bacterial infections. Attempts to culture secondary bacterial invaders and determine sensitivity to antimicrobial agents should be considered before commencing antimicrobial therapy. Use of antiviral medications is still limited in dogs and cats, and controlled studies are lacking.",

Poor cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is associated with spread of the virus to a variety of tissues, severe respiratory and GI signs with or without CNS involvement, and death. Dogs with an intermediate or delayed CMI response may develop persistent infection of the uvea, CNS, and footpad and nasal epithelium, leading to neurologic, cutaneous (hard pad), and ocular signs such as chorioretinitis.

Neurologic signs then occur in some dogs, either with systemic illness or after a several-week delay. Neurologic signs are frequently progressive despite treatment and are a poor prognostic sign. Myoclonus, an involuntary twitching of various muscle groups, can be most pronounced when affected dogs are resting and is virtually pathognomonic for CDV infection. Ocular signs may consist of sudden blindness due to optic neuritis, chorioretinitis, or retinal detachment. Cutaneous signs may be useful for prognostication. Footpad and nasal hyperkeratosis often are accompanied by neurologic complications, whereas the presence of vesicular and pustular dermatitis implies a good CMI response and rarely is associated with neurologic complications.",

Acutely, these may show cytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells when stained with Wright or Diff-Quik stain (Color Plate 111-1). The sensitivity of cytology is increased following application of immunofluorescent antibody to smears by regional diagnostic laboratories. Smears should be air dried and, if possible, fixed in acetone for 5 minutes before transport. Intracytoplasmic inclusions may also be seen in erythrocytes, lymphocytes, other white blood cells, and cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thoracic radiography may reveal an interstitial pattern, or an alveolar pattern with secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia. Analysis of CSF may show increased protein and cell count, and measurement of anti-CDV antibody in the CSF can also be useful for diagnosis in dogs with neurologic signs. Other antemortem diagnostic tests for distemper include immunohistochemistry for CDV antigen on biopsies of nasal mucosa, footpad epithelium, and haired skin of the dorsal neck, and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for viral nucleic acid. Samples suitable for RT-PCR testing include buffy coat cells, whole blood, serum, CSF, and urine.3 With any PCR assay, quality control can be problematic, and the laboratory should be consulted to ensure adequate positive and negative controls are included.

However, tests such as the serum or effusion albumin-to-globulin ratio, effusion \u03b3-globulin concentration, and the Rivalta test can be associated with false-positive and false-negative results, especially in populations where the prevalence of FIP is low.14 Serology is not an FIP test. Positive test results only mean exposure to a coronavirus, and many healthy cats have positive titers but never develop FIP. In one study, titers of 1:1600 or greater in cats that were suspected to have FIP had a 94% chance of truly having FIP (compared with 44% for cats with any antibodies).14 The same study also showed that immunocytochemistry for feline coronavirus on macrophages in effusion fluid had a specificity of 100% for diagnosis of FIP, although the sensitivity was only 57%. The mutation that occurs when FECV becomes virulent FIPV is not predictable, and there is no way to distinguish the viruses based on nucleotide sequence. Because FECV may be found within tissues and body fluids, false-positive results may occur when testing tissues or fluids using RT-PCR. A promising PCR assay has been described that detects viral replication within peripheral blood mononuclear cells.15 Another study found a connection between viral load in hemolymphatic tissues and development of FIP using a quantitative PCR assay,16 which may also prove useful for diagnosis. Further studies using these assays are needed in cats with and without FIP. The gold standard for diagnosis of FIP is detection of pyogranulomatous vasculitis on histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens.",
