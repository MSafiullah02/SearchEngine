The data generated can be used to compare novel strains with other viruses and allow the genetic basis of important phenotypic characteristics, such as antigenic determinants, to be elucidated. Furthermore, virus sequence data can also be used to address more fundamental questions relating to the evolution of viruses. Recent advances in laboratory methodologies allow rapid sequencing of virus genomes. For the first time, this opens up the potential for using genome sequencing to reconstruct virus transmission trees with extremely high resolution and to quickly reveal and identify the origin of unresolved transmission events within discrete infection clusters. Using foot-and-mouth disease virus as an example, this chapter describes strategies that can be successfully used to amplify and sequence the full genomes of RNA viruses. Practical considerations for protocol design and optimization are discussed, with particular emphasis on the software programs used to assemble large contigs and analyze the sequence data for high-resolution epidemiology.",

For the large part, protocols developed to sequence large fragments of nucleic acid can also be adapted to characterize the genomes of RNA viruses, which typically are 15 kb or less. Full-genome sequences of viruses can be used to address fundamental questions relating to evolution, identification of critical antigenic determinants, and viral molecular epidemiology.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease affecting cloven-hoofed livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and water buffalo). The causative agent is a virus belonging to the genus Aphthovirus (family: Picornaviridae) that exists as seven antigenically distinct serotypes, each comprising numerous and constantly evolving variants ( 2 ) . The genome of FMDV is approximately 8,300 nucleotides in length. It comprises a polyadenylated positive-sense RNA that encodes a single polyprotein, which is posttranslationally cleaved into constituent capsid proteins and nonstructural proteins involved in viral replication.",

In addition to forensic molecular epidemiology, full-genome sequence data have also recently contributed to our understanding of a number of aspects of FMDV evolution, including ( i ) evolutionary rates (5 ) ; ( ii ) sites and importance of recombination ( 6, 7 ) ; ( iii ) identification of ordered RNA structures ( 8 ) ; and ( iv ) contribution and significance of the quasi-species phenomenon to evolution ( 9 ) . Sequence data from a wide variety of FMDV isolates also play an important role in the reiterative design of oligonucleotide primers used for molecular assays for routine diagnostic use in reference laboratories (for pan-reactive and serotype-specific detection and strain characterization).",

This high variability poses particular challenges for the design of pan-reactive oligonucleotide primers to reliably amplify complete viral complementary DNAs (cDNAs).

In both of these approaches (adopted for the characterization of FMD outbreaks in the United Kingdom in 2001 and 2007), a large number of specific primers were required. Furthermore, these oligonucleotides are specific for defined lineages of FMDV, limiting their use for study of other genotypes of FMDV. Other FMD laboratories have used similar approaches also requiring large numbers of primers (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Additional protocols, such as rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), can be used to generate sequence data for the terminal ends of the genome and regions close to the poly (C) tract of FMDV. To reduce the complexity of the cycle-sequencing reactions, recognition sequences for universal sequencing primers (such as M13) can be incorporated into the 5 \u00a2 ends of the primers used for PCR ( see Fig. 1a ). Alternative approaches, such as shotgun cloning (for example, Fig. 1c ) are also being considered for full-genome sequencing. Initially, these use long-range PCR to amplify large fragments of the virus genome (possibly even encompassing entire genomic sequences). These PCR products are subsequently fragmented and cloned into plasmid vectors prior to sequencing and reconstruction of the viral sequence. Since this approach uses only two viral-specific primers (which can be targeted to highly conserved regions) and is not reliant on internal virus-specific primers, this method may provide a more suitable approach that has a broader sensitivity to different viral variants. However, these methods need to balance the advantages in diagnostic sensitivity that are gained from using a smaller number of primers with the drawback of lower analytical sensitivity that may arise from amplifying large PCR products (in comparison to shorter fragments).",

Homoplasy describes processes, such as convergent evolution, by which a single mutation can occur twice on independent branches of a tree. Hence, it implies that two sequences sharing a mutation were not necessarily derived from a common ancestor that also contained this mutation. Another hurdle to overcome is back-mutation, by which a mutation reverts to its original genotype. This can cause the specific sequence to appear more ancestral than is necessarily the case. A further drawback to the method of maximum parsimony is that it takes no account of the rate at which mutations arise and the varying probabilities of different mutations occurring (i.e., transversions vs. transitions).",

To infer statistical confidence in either maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood, constructed phylogenies bootstrap analyses ( 31 ) are performed. A further method to infer phylogenies is that of Bayesian inference, which generates a posterior distribution for a parameter based on the prior for that parameter and the likelihood of the data (represented by the sequence alignment). In other words, whereas maximum likelihood analysis investigates the probability of the observed data given a specific evolutionary model, Bayesian inference looks at the probability that a model is correct given the observed data set. With the availability of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods ( 32 ) , Bayesian inference can be a preferred choice for tree estimation because it can be faster than maximum likelihood, and no bootstrapping is required as the posterior probabilities determine the statistical confidence in the tree.",

When studying closely related sequences over a short time period the likelihood of back-mutation is relatively low, and hence maximum parsimony tree construction is likely to give an accurate estimation of tree phylogeny. Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences is often performed with the aim of tracing specific virus history, and in these cases the method of statistical parsimony can be used. The distances depicted by parsimony trees represent the actual number of differences between sequences, whereas for a maximum likelihood tree the probability of change is shown ( Fig. 3 ) .",

Although the statistical parsimony trees drawn by TCS are not bootstrapped, if the data comprise the complete genome sequences of the sampled viruses, then the tree is as accurate and as representative as it can be: It is not sensitive to the choice of a single arbitrary locus because there are no further genetic data retrievable.

In common with other long PCR methods, the parameters of the protocol used for amplification of viral genomes should be optimized prior to routine use. Steps to be considered include the components of the RT or PCR mixes and the cycling times used for amplification.

However, it is important to recognize that this sequence will be a composite of the component variability that, to a greater or lesser extent, may be present. In spite of concerns that it is theoretically possible that the sequence generated will not represent an actual virus species present in the sample, studies with FMDV indicated that the majority of molecular clones have identical sequences to the consensus ( 37 ) . Testing of duplicate samples can generate identical results ( 4 ) , demonstrating that these methods are accurate, and as long as the viral concentrations are relatively high, consensus sequences obtained will mask any individual proofreading errors that might arise due to low fidelity of reverse transcriptase and polymerase enzymes. These aspects relating to accurate determination of the sequences of specific viral genomes (rather than consensus sequences) will be of particular concern in studies that aim to characterize the genetic population structure within samples (i.e., the quasi-species nature of a virus). New technologies and approaches ( see Subheading 3.5 .) may be utilized to address these important questions that underpin our understanding of viral evolution.",
