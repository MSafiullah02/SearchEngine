Pregnancy does not appear to alter test performance.\n\u2022Expectant management at home may be appropriate for many women. For women requiring admission, droplet/contact infection precautions are adequate.\u2022Health care providers should consider delaying routine antepartum care appointments for women who have or are being tested for COVID-19. Self-quarantine as per local protocols is appropriate.\u2022The use of N95 respirators is only required for aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation). The duration and discontinuation of precautions should be determined in accordance with Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines, [15] and provincial and territorial guidance.\u2022Health care providers can consider empiric antibiotic therapy for superimposed bacterial pneumonia in women with confirmed COVID-19 infection or severe respiratory disease.  First-line antibiotics are oral amoxicillin for stable patients and ceftriaxone for severe disease, based on general recommendations for the management of pneumonia.\u2022For maternal surveillance, close monitoring or initiation of an obstetrical early warning system is appropriate.\u2022Initiation of antepartum corticosteroids for fetal maturation could be considered as per current guidelines [16] if preterm delivery is indicated or anticipated based on maternal condition.Antepartum fetal surveillance of confirmed cases of COVID-19 should occur monthly and include fetal ultrasound assessment for growth and anatomy.\n",

However, depending on a family's values and availability of resources they may choose to separate infant from mother until isolation precautions for the mother can be formally discontinued.\u2022Women should practice good handwashing before and wear a mask while providing infant care.\u2022Women who choose to breastfeed should be allowed to do so after appropriate handwashing and while wearing a mask. It is possible that the mother can transmit antibodies to the infant through breastmilk; however, there is limited evidence of this transmission and the potential benefits are unclear.\n",
