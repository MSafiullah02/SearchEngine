However, in numerous countries including France, RT-PCR kits are not available enough to allow for large population testing. A definitive diagnosis is essential to control this disease so diagnostic methods need to be improved. Computed Tomography (CT)-scan has a reported high sensitivity 2 but radiological signs can be delayed after disease onset, with up to 56% CT negativity in the first 3 days of symptomatic infection 3 . Moreover, performing large scale CT scanning during the current pandemic is made difficult by the need to apply rigorous disinfection protocols between patients 4 ",

Imaging is indicated in case of moderate to severe disease manifestations, but not indicated in case of mild symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and no risk factor for disease progression. Even though CT-scan has a higher sensitivity than PCR (71-95% for PCR and 97-98% for CT), radiologists may still experience some difficulties for differentiating COVID-19 from non-COVID pneumonia 6, 7 . False-negativity of PCR or CT as well as COVID-19 pneumonia mimickers on CT may lead to inaccurate diagnoses. Pre-test probability combining clinical and biological features has proven to be a very useful tool, already used in clinical practice for management of patients with a suspicion of pulmonary embolism 8 . Therefore, we aimed to derive a new prediction score based on clinical and biological variables, independently from subjective clinical evaluation by assessing a retrospective cohort of patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) of our institution for a clinical suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection. We validated this Pre-test probability for SARS-Cov-2 Infection based on Scoring (PARIS score) in a distinct multicenter cohort of patients admitted for the same reason in ED or infectious disease departments of 3 hospitals.

Demographic characteristics and comorbidities including high blood pressure, respiratory diseases (asthma, restrictive or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), immunodeficiency, kidney failure were recorded. Furthermore, clinical symptoms such as cough, fever, headache, diarrhea, anosmia, ageusia, oxygen desaturation were evaluated. Finally, biological tests including results of complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and C Reactive Protein (CRP) were analyzed. A final diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was retained if the patient had a confirmed diagnosis with both positive RT-PCR and CT-scan showing signs of COVID-19 pneumonia (usually bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidated pulmonary opacities): since no test had a perfect diagnostic performance at the time of the study, we used in the derivation cohort a strict definition of patients and controls. Thus, controls were patients with both negative RT-PCR results and negative CT-scan (normal or with alternative diagnosis). We evaluated clinical and biological variables to find the ones correlated with SARS-Cov-2 infection. We only included basic biological tests, widely available and affordable, which are adapted for a pre-test probability score.",

A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to measure the relationship between the categorial variable representing presence or absence of SARS-Cov-2 infection and the potential independent variables.

The PARIS score may enhance the proposed Fleischner diagnostic algorithm by improving the pre-test performance. Thus, in case of high pre-test probability with no comorbidities explaining leukopenia, a second RT-PCR test or an additional CT-scan may be useful to establish the final diagnosis.

Furthermore, even if patients with lung diseases were more frequent in the control group, their average oxygen saturation was 96%. Thus, low oxygen saturation may be an additional argument of SARS-Cov-2 infection in patients with no previous pulmonary disease. However, the PARIS score is mostly useful in patients with relatively mild clinical presentation.

There was no statistically significant difference between demographic characteristics of patients and controls but the 2 groups were not matched and controls more frequently presented pulmonary diseases and immunodeficiencies. A small number of patients was included due to the urgent need of diagnostic tools, but this is at risk of low reproducibility in a larger population. Indeed, the performance of the pre-test score was slightly lower in the validation cohort. We used only regular blood tests with complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP, and did not evaluate LDH or D-dimers, since they seem to be mainly correlated with severity and have been described as risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome 25 . Another limit of this study is the only inclusion of patients from hospital wards, which probably induces a recruitment bias, since they may not be representative of patients with milder symptoms who consult their general practitioner, even though most symptomatic patients are directly referred to ED in our country. The evaluation of the performance of our pre-test probability score in a larger population would be of interest. Even though a part of patients in our cohort were admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) shortly after presentation, more severe patients All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Four controls didn't have any final diagnosis explaining their clinical symptoms and leukopenia and could therefore be false negative for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Only one patient was considered as a false-negative of the pre-test probability score with a low-probability score of 1. This patient had negative RT-PCR and minimal involvement on CT-scan (small ground glass opacities).However, the score was also helpful to reclassify patients: Six out of 10 infected patients, based on RT-PCR, with negative or indeterminate CT-scan results had a high-probability score (while the 4 other patients had an intermediate PARIS score). Fifteen out of 21 patients with negative PCR but CT features typical for COVID-19 pneumonia had a high-probability score (Five other patients had an intermediate score and one patient had a low score).All rights reserved.
