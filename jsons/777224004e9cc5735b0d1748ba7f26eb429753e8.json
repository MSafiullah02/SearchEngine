The estimation of the time-dependence behavior of the parameters of epidemiological models have been an active research field in the past [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, our procedure is different to previous ones, as it does not require any set of differential equations as a model. Instead of studying the total data set that gives origin to total structure of the pandemic, we focus in the study of time evolution of the parameters that produce such total structure, i.e., we do a meta-analysis of the data set system. Therefore, instead of solving a model described by a set of differential equations with solutions that fit the data, a meta-analysis proceeds in the opposite direction, finding the global evolution of the parameters, and thus obtaining a model. This procedure allow us to find the global dynamical behavior of data by studying the day-to-day evolution of the adjustment parameters. In other words, we can extract the time-dependent information of the system without solving any differential equation set. Hence, we are able to solve the system in a phenomenological fashion. This proper meta-analysis of the adjustment parameters can provide the kind of information that is needed in order to have a better understanding of the evolution of the pandemic. The main goal of this work is to show that this procedure gives us global information of the changes in the spread of the disease.",

This model considers three kind of populations, the susceptible S = S(t), the infected I = I(t) and the recovered R = R(t) population, respectively, all of them evolving in time. Besides, the total population N = S + I + R, is constant in time. The three variables are related by the differential system\u1e60 = \u2212\u03b1SI,\u0130 = \u03b1SI \u2212 \u03b2I, an\u1e0b R = \u03b2I, where\u02d9symbols time derivation. Here, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are constant parameters, that contain the relevant information for pandemic evolution. Our lack of knowledge on how the pandemic evolves, is hidden in such parameters. Although no explicit exact solution for R = R(t) is known, it is straightforward to show that at second order in an expansion around \u03b1R/\u03b2, we can obtain the solution for the recovered population as a function of time [17, 18] , given by R(t) \u2248 r 1 tanh(r 2 t\u2212r 3 )+r 4 . Here, r 1 = \u03b3\u03b2 2 /(\u03b1 2 S 0 ), r 2 = \u03b2\u03b3/2, r 3 = tanh \u22121 (\u03b1S 0 /(\u03b2\u03b3) \u2212 1/\u03b3), and r 4 = \u03b2/\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 /(\u03b1 2 S 0 ), are all constants, in terms of \u03b3 = (\u03b1S 0 /\u03b2 \u2212 1) 2 + 2S 0 I 0 \u03b1 2 /\u03b2 2 1/2 , where S 0 and I 0 are the initial values of susceptible and infected populations in t = 0. It has been assumed that initial value of recovered population R 0 = 0. It is important to realize that the system is now completely solved, as the infected population can be readily obtained by I(t) =\u1e58/\u03b2 \u2248 (r 1 \u03b3/2)sech 2 (r 2 t \u2212 r 3 ), while the susceptible population is S(t) = N \u2212 I(t) \u2212 R(t). Those solutions are often used to study in an approximated manner the pandemic evolution. However, they fail to describe correctly its dynamics when social conditions change or different governmental decisions are taken along the progress of the pandemic.",

Therefore, the meta-analysis produces a better fitting of the estimation of the temporal behavior of infected population, thus solving the pandemic dynamics in a phenomenological way.

This regularity starts at some time \u03b6 = 1 for the three meta-parameters, and it depends on each particular studied case.

It is the goal of this work to search for the explicit form of each meta-parameter for the studied countries, finding in this way the underlying dynamical structure of their pandemic scenarios, and thus determine R M and I M . With all this in mind, let us discuss the pandemic data for cumulative infectious cases as evolving in time for eight different countries, and how the phenomenological dynamical procedure applies to each of them. We use the case of Italy to carefully explain each step in the procedure, as it is straightforwardly replicated for the other country cases.",

The meta-parameters are calculated for each day (from R 0 ), taking into account all previous days. Thus, each new calculated meta-parameter contains the information of any previous change. Before day \u03b6, there is no regular pattern in the evolution of meta-parameter. But, after day \u03b6 a very distinctive regular dynamical behavior emerge. For the current case, after day \u03b6 = 33, the meta-parameters a 1 (t), a 2 (t), and a 3 (t) time-dependence behavior is almost quadratic, shown by red lines in Fig. 2(a) . The coefficients of the quadratic form (5) are given in Table II. These meta-parameters are used in (4) to obtain the solid blue fit in Fig. 1(a) . Notice that the fitting precision for the slope of the recovered population becomes more accurate as it grows, i.e., a better fit for its derivative is achieved, compared to fitting (2) . This implies that it contains better information on the the number of infected individuals. This is shown in Fig. 1(b) , where the data represented by dots is the infected population calculated according to Eq. (1). The red dashed line is the infected population fit (3), with their respectively parameters.
