            "text": "The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) agent is classified as a vesiculovirus under family Rhabdoviridae and is widely distributed in North and South America.15 Two serotypes of VSV circulate in the United States: New Jersey (VSV\u2013NJ) and Indiana (VSV\u2013IN). Isolates exhibit a low level of genetic variation and only four distinct genotypes have been detected in the United States and Mexico. VSV commonly infects horses, cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs. Clinical disease is rare in llamas. Serologic evidence of VSV infection in alpacas has been reported.16 Alpaca VSV isolates have been classified as genotype G215 and most infections with VSV are subclinical and go unrecognized. Viral infection is localized in the epithelial cells of the mouth. Excess salivation is the most common clinical sign of VSV infection. Fulminant disease is characterized by formation of vesicles in the mouth, tongue, nostrils, feet, and teats. The incubation period of VSV is about 2\u20138 days. Death is rare but animals may refuse to eat. Mild antiseptic mouthwashes may be applied to prevent secondary infections. Little-to-no immunity develops against VSV and no vaccine is currently available to protect against this disease. Other differential viral diseases to consider in diagnosis are rabies, orf (contagious ecthyma), and foot-and-mouth disease, a serious foreign animal disease. Because VSV is a reportable disease in the United States, if you suspect VSV, contact your state's USDA\u2013APHIS area veterinarian-in-charge, who will arrange to collect appropriate samples to be sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Samples to be submitted include serum for VSV-serum neutralization testing for both serotypes. Vesicular fluid and epithelium scrapings are also collected for virus isolation and PCR. If VSV is detected and confirmed, the animals will be placed on quarantine for 30 days after the symptoms disappear. This is a seasonal disease with more cases happening in summer and fewer in winter.17 Epidemiologic maps indicate that viral outbreaks occur in populations located along rivers.",

It is an RNA virus that has seven immunologically distinct serotypes and subtypes.18 Susceptible species include cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, and deer. New World camelids appear to less susceptible to FMD virus.19 Foot-and-mouth disease is a major barrier for trade around the world because it can cause serious morbidity and mortality in livestock.13 The role of New World camelids in FMD epidemiology is controversial. Depending on the type of virus contracted, individual responses vary. Based on an experimental study after exposure to FMD strain A24, llamas developed vesicular lesions on their extremities.20 In this study, animals did not excrete virus in esopharyngeal fluid beyond 8 days.13 Therefore, it is likely that camelids play a minor role in transmission of FMD virus, because they do not become carriers of the virus. Although not performed commonly, llama embryo transfer presents a low risk for transmission of FMD.21\n",

These viruses replicate exclusively in skin and mucosal surfaces, are resistant to disinfectants and stable in the environment. Camelid mucocutaneous fibropapillomas were reported on the lips, nose, nares and cheeks in two llamas and three alpacas, all 6 years of age.22 Lesions on the face appeared as hyperkeratotic gray nodular tumors. To confirm a diagnosis of papillomavirus, fresh skin biopsies can be submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for pan-papillomavirus PCR. Based on a partial sequence of a conserved sequence of the E1 gene of papillomavirus, the camelid papillomavirus has a 73% homology with bovine papillomavirus-1 and 64% homology with canine papillomavirus. A rabbit polyclonal antibody is available for diagnosis of most animal papillomaviruses; however, it has not yet been demonstrated to be useful in diagnosing camelid fibropapilloma cases. Electron microscopy can also be used to diagnose papillomavirus infections.",

            "text": "Speculation about potential effects of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus infection in NWC were initially viewed with skepticism about the disease potential of the virus,23 because early evidence centered on serologic studies and sporadic reports of BVD viral infections being associated with respiratory disease, enteric disease, and occasional abortions.23 A pestivirus, BVD has two biotypes, cytopathic and noncytopathic, based on production of cytopathic effects in cell culture, and is further classified as two major genotypes, Type I and II; both have been reported in NWC. Bovine viral diarrhea virus has now been shown to be involved in NWC cases of diarrhea, ill thrift, reproductive losses, respiratory disease, and disseminated disease23, 24, 25 and it is capable of causing multisystem effects in NWC in much the same manner as BVD viral infections in cattle, sheep, and goats.25 The serologic incidence of BVDV in NWC has been reported to be from about 4.4%24 to as high as 53%.23 One of the major effects of BVD viruses upon NWC is infection of na\u00efve animals during pregnancy, resulting in abortion or establishing an immunotolerance in the developing fetus via congenital infection. The hallmark of the congenital infection is the formation of a cria that is persistently infected (PI), in much the same way that has been described for BVD virus PIs in cattle. The literature has been gracious in regards to documenting the occurrence of BVD PI crias, and, of major importance, biosecurity measures to minimize contact of pregnant BVD-na\u00efve alpacas/llamas with BVD virus-infected herd mates (including commingling with cattle, sheep, and goats).23 Much of the clinical interpretation and pathogenesis of BVDV in NWC is derived from studies in cattle. Production of PI in cattle is a characteristic of BVDV. Recently, PI has been reported in alpacas in North America and Europe.25, 26, 27, 28, 29 Because the gestation period is much longer in NWC than in cattle, the period of susceptibility of the camelid fetus for induction of PI has not been accurately determined. BVDV has been isolated from a stillborn alpaca fetus;30 however, the number of BVDV-induced abortions is still rare in NWC. The virus has been isolated from crias that fail to gain body weight.27 Ocular and nasal infections have also been reported.28\n",

However, the commercial antigen-capture ELISA test can give false positive results, because NWC serum samples cause high background reactions. Diagnosis of BVD viral infections in NWC follows strategies similar to cattle, including virus isolation from key tissues (lymph nodes, whole blood, fetal tissues, and placenta), PCR from whole blood, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed tissues. The availability of BVD virus PI-specific assays for cattle has not yet been validated for NWC. These assays use ear notch elutes or serum from suspected animals that are tested for BVD viral antigen by an ELISA or antigen-capture ELISA (ACE). Studies conducted on naturally infected BVD virus PI crias have indicated that the serum may be suitable for testing. Until further validation studies are conducted, screening NWC by BVD viral-specific PCR on whole blood will detect active infection/viraemia (either acute, transient infection, or a PI), and serology on serum will detect neutralizing antibody indicating prior infection and probable immunity.",

Seropositivity to BVD virus was linked to the feeding of supplemental bovine colostrum containing BVD viral antibodies. The study emphasized the need to establish biosecurity measures that prevent transporting female alpacas with crias at side to other farms for breeding. If the cria is persistently infected with BVD, the probability of BVD virus infection to susceptible (na\u00efve) females in other herds is a high risk. Experimental inoculation of alpacas vaccinated with a killed BVD viral vaccine resulted in seroconversion by all the animals and protection against a challenge infection with a field strain of alpaca BVD virus type 1b (S. Byers and colleagues, personal communication, 2008). Although licensed vaccines are available for controlling BVD viral infections in cattle, none are labeled for use in NWC.

The presence of RV was confirmed by electron microscopy. Circulating antibodies against RV were not detected in either animal, indicating a failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies. Coronavirus infection was not detected in the two young guanacos from either farm, based on bovine coronavirus antigen and serology testing; however, bacterial infections due to Escherichia coli and Salmonella were detected. Both guanacos were captured, hand raised, and fed with bovine milk. Based on electrophoresis, both farms experienced a distinctive long dsRNA electropherotype of RV that differed from each other and also from bovine RV isolates. Both rotaviruses were genotype G8; however, the bovine P types of the RV were P[1] and P[14].35 A subsequent serologic survey conducted on the two farms indicated a high (95%) prevalence of antibody titers in the herds.36\n",

The virus was detected throughout the year.37 Alpaca coronavirus is closely related to antigenic group 2 bovine coronavirus.39 In a recent case report,38 an adult 4-year-old alpaca experienced weight loss, nutritional stress, and foul smelling, watery diarrhea. Antigenic group 2 coronavirus related to bovine coronavirus was detected by RT\u2013PCR and IHC.38 Diagnosis of coronaviral diarrhea can be achieved by electron microscopy or by PCR techniques. It has been speculated that the association of coronaviral diarrhea in alpacas may be an indication of a stress (nutritional, immunologic, and so forth), and may be a stress indicator (James Evermann, personal communication, 2009).38, 39 There is a preliminary report that acute respiratory syndrome (ARS), a recently described disease (also known by the colloquial term \u201csnots\u201d in the alpaca industry), is caused by antigenic group I coronavirus.40 The disease is associated with mild-to-severe respiratory presentations and, on postmortem examination, interstitial pneumonia is observed with lymphocytic infiltrates, thus indicating a viral cause. Koch's postulates have not been fulfilled; however, based on serology, the animals from herds with a reported history of ARS have been found to have increased antibody titers to the group I coronavirus.40\n",

Most herpesviruses are highly host-specific, although there are rare reports of transmission of herpesvirus infections to other species after close contact.41 The occurrence of disease following infection of NWC by equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) was a major turning point in studies of infections capable of causing clinical symptoms in alpacas and llamas. Before this report,41 serologic data had indicated that NWC were susceptible to infection as determined by specific antibodies, but apparently resistant to many equine and bovine viruses. An outbreak of blindness and encephalitis due to infection with EHV-1 occurred in a group of 100 camelids on an exotic animal farm in New York State, one year after their import from Chile.41 Four animals developed neurologic disease. Unlike EHV-1 infection of horses, which causes a systemic infection, the pathogenesis of EHV-1 in NWC involved infection of the nasal mucosa, followed by spread to the olfactory nerve, optic nerve, and then CNS. The blindness in these animals was characterized by dilated unresponsive pupils that were confirmed by fundoscopic examination and there was evidence of vitritis, retinal vasculitis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, and optic neuritis in 21 alpacas and one llama. All affected animals were seropositive for antibodies to EHV-1. Virus isolated from brain and eye tissues was experimentally tested for virulence by intranasal infection of three llamas.42 Two animals developed severe neurologic disease and one developed mild disease. Lesions developed in brain and retina after experimental infection and the virus was recovered from thalamus of one animal.42 Vaccines are available for prevention of EHV-1 in horses only, but, as a rule, they are not to be used off-label to protect NWC unless the animals are in close proximity to horses. Only killed vaccines should be considered in the NWC until further safety\u2013efficacy studies are conducted with modified live virus vaccines.",

The major symptoms are self-mutilation and attacks upon humans and penmates. It has also been noted that NWC cannot spit due to the paralysis of pharynx. Diagnosis of rabies must be handled by a veterinarian and is conducted by standard methods on impression smears of fresh brain. Prevention of rabies can be achieved by barrier vaccination of animals in close proximity to camelids, such as dogs and cats.

A yearling llama that had a 6-month history of weight loss, lameness, and opportunistic infections tested positive for retrovirus reverse transcriptase in macrophages and lymph node.53 Consistent with retroviral infection, a complete blood count showed neutropenia and lymphopenia and the animal had generalized lymphoid hypoplasia and plasma cell depletion. The llama also developed Pneumocystis carinii infection of lungs. Suspected equine arteritis virus (EAV) abortion was reported in a herd of alpacas, but the diagnosis was not confirmed.54 The virus was detected by RT\u2013PCR in fetal tissues collected from a female alpaca that aborted in her last trimester of gestation.54 All five animals in the herd had antibodies to EAV. There is a preliminary report of isolation of bovine herpesvirus in a llama with bronchopneumonia.55\nPasteurella haemolytica was isolated from the respiratory tract of the llama. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) herpesvirus was confirmed by virus isolation, yet the animal was negative for IBR antibodies by serum neutralization test; this lack of antibody response may have been to due to acute death.",

According to a recent review,56 biosecurity can be defined as those efforts designed to prevent the introduction and subsequent spread of a disease in a population of animals. These efforts can be further divided into external measures and internal measures (Table 1\n). External measures are those steps that are directed at preventing introduction of new diseases into a group; whereas internal measures are aimed at minimizing the spread and subsequent disease in populations where an infection is already established or endemic. To be valid, the minimum biosecurity plan should address (1) the means of isolating new animals introduced into an existing population of animals; (2) the regulation of animal movement and on-the-farm worker and equipment traffic; and (3) the practical design and implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures that are specifically directed at reducing the pathogen load within the population of animals.",

Table 2\nlists those infectious agents that may be encountered. The table is divided into subclinical infections, where a biosecurity profile would be of interest in a presale/purchase, preshipment for regulatory purposes, and prebreeding. The profile usually includes serology testing for Brucella abortus, BTV, BVDV, and Johne's disease serology, BVDV PI detection, and coronaviral shedding (electron microscopy) or serology. These biosecurity profiles may vary from region to region and it is best to contact the laboratory for specifics on proper samples, form of shipment, and laboratory fees. The other section of Table 2 lists those diseases that may be suspected and the samples that can be collected either antemortem or postmortem. This section of the table is further divided into where the predominant disease symptoms are manifested, such as respiratory, reproduction, neurologic, or skin. It is best to contact the laboratory before collecting specimens to determine the best samples to collect for maximizing diagnostic results.Diagnosis of camelid viral diseases is offered at the following:\u2022New York Animal Health, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York; http://diaglab.vet.cornell.edu\n\u2022Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Stillwater, Oklahoma; http://www.cvhs.okstate.edu\n\u2022Oregon State University Diagnostic Laboratory, Corvallis, Oregon; http://oregonstate.edu/vetmed/vdl/vdl.htm\n\u2022Washington State University, Pullman, Washington; http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts_waddl\n\n",
