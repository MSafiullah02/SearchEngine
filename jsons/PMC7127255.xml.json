            "text": "\nMycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (Cill\u00f3niz et al., 2012, Str\u00e5lin et al., 2006), accounting for 15\u201320% of cases, and up to 40% in children. It may also be responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and extra-pulmonary manifestations. This infection is endemic, with epidemic peaks occurring every 4 to 7 years (B\u00e9b\u00e9ar, 2007), as was observed in several European countries from 2010 to 2011 (Jacobs, 2012). Laboratory diagnosis was previously performed with cultures of the organism, but this technique is slow and less sensitive than serological or nucleic acid amplification assays (She et al., 2010). The nucleic acid amplification assays appear to be the most sensitive methods; however, those techniques cannot distinguish between asymptomatic and acute infections (Dorigo-Zetsma et al., 2001, Foy, 1993, Ieven and Goossens, 1997, Loens et al., 2003). Serology still has a place of choice in the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, but this must rely on the analysis of two coupled sera taken at 2\u20133 weeks. Serological diagnosis can confirm a recent infection when there is an apparition of the IgG or when there is a significant increase in IgG levels between the two sera because upon reinfection, IgM may not be present (Waites and Talkington, 2004). Complement fixation has been replaced with a variety of commercially available techniques, specifically with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which allow for a precise quantification of IgM, IgA or IgG (B\u00e9b\u00e9ar, 2007). The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of 10 serological assays for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection.",

Fifty sera were coupled, and the interval between the two sera collections varied from 5 days to 5 months. The average age of the patients was 23.63 years (median: 15.5 years). Sera were sorted into different groups (Table 1\n): M. pneumoniae infections (n = 32), non-specific M. pneumoniae IgM (n = 25), other infections causing an interstitial pneumonia and positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology, which cross-reacts with M. pneumoniae serology (Beersma et al., 2005). Cases of M. pneumoniae infections were initially chosen in front of an apparition or a significant augmentation of IgG on paired sera using SeroMP (Savyon Diagnostics, Ashdod, Israel) which was in use for the routine analyses in our laboratory. The serological results of those samples were then compared to those obtained with the other techniques evaluated and finally the group of sera representing the M. pneumoniae infections was composed either from sera exhibiting an apparition or significant augmentation of IgG between paired samples with at least two of the evaluated techniques and sera with high amount of M. pneumoniae IgG, IgA and IgM with SeroMP Recombinant IgM, IgA and IgG (Savyon Diagnostics, Ashdod, Israel) and M. pneumoniae IgM, IgA and IgG ELISA Medac (Medac, Hamburg, Germany). Cases of Q fever would ideally have been included, but these were not available. Sera were selected from the serum bank at the Porte de Hal Laboratory, which performs serological analyses for four public university hospitals that are located in Brussels, Belgium.",

IgA are believed to be infrequently synthesized in children. In this work, 9 children less than 15 years of age were included in the group of serologically confirmed M. pneumoniae infections. Two 3-year-old children produced IgM, but not IgA, whereas the 7 others, including one 1-year-old child, produced IgA and IgM. The advantage of detecting IgA is that these antibodies usually appear in reinfections and thus could already help to suspect this state in an acute-phase serum sample that is positive for IgA and IgG without waiting for the results of the convalescent-phase serum that would show a rise in IgG levels (Table 5\n).",

With the 88 sera remaining, the seroprevalence was different depending on the assay used, and there was an agreement among all 4 assays for only one sample (Table 6\n). The very low seroprevalence of IgG in general is very striking, particularly in patients over the age of 65 (9.09% for SeroMP and 0% for the 3 other assays, obtained from 11 samples from patients over the age of 65). These percentages are far from the 40\u201350% seroprevalence of IgG in adulthood and 60% over the age of 65, as described by Tuuminen et al. (2000). These observations raise several questions: (1) are the serological assays able to correctly detect M. pneumoniae IgG in acute phases and over time; (2) are the cut-offs of these assays too high; and (3) are the M. pneumoniae IgG lasting over time?",

For IgM, the SeroMP Recombinant and the Liaison tests obtained lower specificities, and cross-reactivity was mainly observed in sera from acute EBV and CMV infections. For IgA, the SeroMP Recombinant assay appears to be more specific than the Medac assay. The interest in determining IgA levels may be critical to early detection of reinfections because the IgM response may be absent. For IgG tests, the performances were comparable, except for the SeroMP test, which had several false negative results that led to a low sensitivity. However, 22 sera had to be excluded from the IgG results prior to the sensitivity and specificity calculations due to discrepancies between the assays, and thus, the performances may be overstated. These findings implicate the need for improving and standardizing the serological M. pneumoniae assays, particularly for IgG determination. A recent article reports the attempts to develop a blotting technique that improves the performance of the serological assays (Dumke et al., 2012).",
