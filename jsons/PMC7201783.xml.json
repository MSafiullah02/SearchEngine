More importantly, the patient suffered from a more severe lung infection and the blood oxygen saturation decreased obviously. Therefore, a multidisciplinary discussion including experts from departments of thoracic surgery, ICU, respiration, radiology, as well as anaesthesiology was organized. The physicians from the respiratory department and ICU insisted that the patient still required ventilator-assisted ventilation although it could not ameliorate severe abnormal breathing, extra antibiotic usage with effective lung care might be useful to suppress lung inflammation, the most important treatment was to perform chest wall fixation. With the three-dimensional bone reconstruction images of chest wall provided by the radiology department, the chief physician from the thoracic surgery department indicated that it was not suitable to perform conventional rib and sternum fixation in this case as the images clearly showed too many fracture sites in ribs (including costal cartilage), sternum, anterior as well as lateral chest wall (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1), thus this method could not establish a stable chest wall, and time-consuming, traumatic, more bleeding and costly. We noticed the use of Nuss procedure in trauma had been previously reported [4\u20139]. It was a new effective treatment for severe flail chest patients who couldn\u2019t survive without prolonged mechanical ventilation. The most important advantages for the Nuss procedure were minimally invasive and much less time-consuming. However, it was not suitable when there were combined fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls as the Nuss bar required a stable lateral chest wall to guarantee the physical support, which the patient lacked. Therefore, neither the Nuss procedure nor rib fixation could completely fix the chest wall and eliminate abnormal breathing. We then proposed a strategy to combine the Nuss procedure with rib fixation. First, the rib fixation rebuilt a stable lateral chest wall, then the Nuss procedure stabilized the front chest wall. This strategy was also supported by the physicians from the anaesthesiology department as he mentioned that the conventional rib and sternum fixation could severely influence the patient\u2019s respiratory and circulatory system during the operation. Finally, combining the use of the Nuss procedure and rib fixation was determined after the multidisciplinary discussion.",

Then the thoracoscopy-assisted Nuss procedure was performed. Two Nuss bars (GRINM Advanced Materials Co., LTD, Beijing, China) were inserted into the third and fifth intercostal spaces of both sides for elevating and stabilizing the depressed mid sternum and fractured ribs at the anterior chest wall respectively to avoid the fractured sites of the ribs (Fig. 2a, b, red arrows). The Nuss procedure process was as follows: one 40 cm Nuss bar was bent into a symmetric arc shape. Two skin incisions (1.5 cm) were made on both lateral chest walls in the mid-axillary line at the third intercostal space. Submuscular tunnels were made the outside pleural entry and exit points. The right entry point was punctured with an introducer, and a 1 cm thoracoscope was placed into the pleural cavity. The mediastinum was dissected under direct vision. The exit point at the left side was punctured under direct visual guidance as well, and a 32F chest tube passed through the tunnel created by the introducer. The bar was positioned by following the guidance of the chest tube. The Nuss bar was rotated, and the depressed anterior upper chest wall was elevated. However, the shape of the anterior lower chest wall still had depression resulting from the large fractured areas, and paradoxical movement existed too. Therefore, another 40 cm Nuss bar was inserted at the fifth intercostal space with the same method. Two bars finally were fixed on the stable lateral ribs with steel wires. Finally, two Nuss bars and three rib fixation plates simultaneously exert sustained support, and the shape of the chest wall was nearly perfect (Fig. 2c, d).\n",

The depression of the flail chest is similar to the shape of pectus excavatum. Therefore, the Nuss procedure has been used for surgical treatment of severe flail chest, whether it is caused by trauma [4\u20139] or other diseases [10]. The most advantage of the Nuss procedure for flail chest is minimal invasion, short time-consuming and good outcomes. However, it is only suitable for patients with lateral chest wall stability, because both the fixation and force points of the Nuss bars are located on the lateral chest wall. An unstable lateral chest wall cannot support and secure the Nuss bar. In the case presented here, the patient suffered severe flail chest due to a traffic accident with multiple ribs and sternal fractures in both anterior and lateral chest walls, and they were all in an unstable state. Since the large depression area and the multiple fractured sites on the ribs and mid sternum, neither rib fixation nor the Nuss procedure alone could rebuild the floating chest wall. Therefore, we decided to combine the use of Nuss procedure and rib fixation for this severe flail chest patient after an MDT. Firstly, rib fixation plates were used to fix fractured ribs in the lateral chest wall, which could provide a steady lateral chest wall, then inserted a Nuss bar at the third intercostal space to assist elevation of the depressed anterior chest wall as well as the depression in pectus excavatum. However, the shape of the anterior lower chest wall still had depression due to large fractured areas, as well as the paradoxical movement. Therefore, we inserted another Nuss bar at the fifth intercostal space with the same approach. Finally, two Nuss bars and three rib fixation plates simultaneously exert sustained support, and the shape of the chest wall was nearly perfect. The patient recovered smoothly without complications after the operation, and the outcome of the combining procedure was satisfying.",
