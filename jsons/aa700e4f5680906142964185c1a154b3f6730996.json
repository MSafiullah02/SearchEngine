Thus, the colostral management practice used in this study was unsuitable for reducing bacterial load. One possible factor influencing the rapid colonization of colostrum by bacteria was the hot weather prevailing during this trial, because colostrum fed during warm months is contaminated more often than is colostrum fed during cold months (Fecteau et al. 2002) .

We speculated that colostrum with high total bacterial counts would provide a more substantial source of bacteria for gut colonization and subsequently be reflected in a greater incidence of diarrhea. Also, it was expected that high TCC in colostrum could lead to high endotoxin levels, which might cause harm to neonatal calves, as has been the case in other studies ). However, this was not observed and indicates that contamination of colostrum following pasteurization and freeze-thawing may provide a less pathogenic source of bacteria for gut colonization. Also, the lack of negative effect of high TBC on the occurrence of diarrhea was likely due to the presence of colostral or blood plasma immunoglobulins, which provide local immunity against several pathogens associated with calf diarrheal disease such as Escherichia coli, coronavirus and rotavirus (Crouch et al. 2000; Arthington et al. 2002) . Another plausible reason for the absence of effect of highly contaminated colostrum on the occurrence of diarrhea apparently was the inclusion of an antibiotic in the milk replacer.

Increased growth rates in preweaning calves are consistent with increased intake of nutrients (Quigley et al. 2006) , thus, it seems that calves fed the highly contaminated colostrum were equally affected in their health as calves fed colostrum with low bacterial counts, and consequently they were not affected in their growth rate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 105, "text": "(McGuirk & Collins 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 106, "end": 124, "text": "Dewell et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 503, "end": 524, "text": "Priestley et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 796, "end": 810, "text": "(Johnson 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1241, "text": "(Quigley et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Calves health"}, {"text": "The calves receiving the colostrum with higher immunoglobulin concentration tended to present higher daily weight gain during the preweaning period, compared with calves fed colostrum with <85 mg Ig/mL.

It is likely that greater absorption of protein from initial feedings of colostrum rich in proteins could lead to increased BUN concentrations, as the excess protein is metabolized and cleared from the body. Also, it could be that a portion of the greater crude protein in colostrum consumed by calves was used for energy with subsequent deamination and increased urea N concentration (Hadorn et al. 1997) . Serum cholesterol levels were higher in calves fed the colostrum with \u2265100 000 TBC. Low serum concentration of this metabolite seems to negatively affect the immune system (Nyman et al. 2008) , but in the present study, this was not the case as calves offered the colostrum with the highest TBC and higher serum cholesterol levels were more prone to pneumonia.Glucose levels were not affected by colostrum bacterial load and immunoglobulin concentration. Due to the reflexive closure of the reticular groove in neonatal calves, the primary source of energy substrate is glucose derived from intestinal absorption. Thus, these data suggest that neither colostrum contamination nor immunoglobulin concentration alters serum glucose in neonatal calves. The same was true for TP and creatinine, which indicates that calves in the different groups were ingesting the same dry matter, energy and protein (Khan et al. 2007 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 553, "end": 573, "text": "(Hadorn et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 748, "end": 767, "text": "(Nyman et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1491, "text": "(Khan et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Blood serum metabolites"}, {"text": "Bacterial colonization of on-farm pasteurized frozenthawed colostrum occurred rapidly in this hot environment; therefore, under the conditions of the present study, this colostrum management should not be incorporated into any calf-rearing program. Total bacterial count in pasteurized frozen-thawed colostrum, measured shortly before feeding, may provide important prognostic information on neonatal pneumonia in Holstein calves, which may be useful in reducing the risk of respiratory diseases in a hot environment. However, high bacterial load in colostrum does not represent a risk factor for neonatal diarrhea in calves fed medicated milk replacer.This study reinforced the importance of high immunoglobulin concentration in first colostrum by illustrating the interconnectedness of high immunoglobulin concentration with lower respiration rate, increased fecal consistency and higher preweaning daily weight gain. Additionally, an interaction between TBC and TCC in colostrum with colostrum immunoglobulin content was evident since calves fed colostrum with high amounts of immunoglobulin had lower rates of pneumonia, but not if colostrum with high amounts of TBC was provided. Finally, our results show that the morbidity risk due to preweaning calf diarrhea and pneumonia is very high in an international perspective, which indicates that colostrum with high immunoglobulin concentration does not decrease the incidence of calf health problems in a hot environment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}]}
