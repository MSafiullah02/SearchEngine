Reads were analyzed using VirMet (https://github.com/ozagordi/VirMet/releases/tag/v1.1.1). Briefly, reads were quality-filtered, cleaned from non-viral reads, and aligned with Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against an in-house, viral database that contains approximately 68 000 different virus sequences. Raw sequence data and JCPyV consensus sequences have been uploaded to zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1344146).",

Several studies reported the detection of the virus in the urine of kidney transplant recipients [9, 27]. In the context of immunosuppressed individuals, JCPyV has been associated with 2 clinical entities: that is, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and PyVAN [28]. However, in contrast to BKPyV, JCPyV has been rarely observed as a causative pathogen for PyVAN [22, 29]. Different results have been stated in the literature regarding JCPyV viruria and its impact on transplant outcomes. On the one hand, JCPyV urinary shedding was associated with reduced creatinine clearance in kidney and liver transplant patients, and might therefore play a role in renal dysfunction [30]. On the other hand, the finding of JCPyV viruria was shown to correlate with a favorable clinical course, especially if detected early [25]. Interestingly, Cheng et al reported better graft survival and lower rejection rates in kidney recipients with JCPyV viruria [31]. Also, in our study, clinically and on renal function, no impact was seen. In studies with larger numbers, longer periods of observation and, presumably, in deceased donor kidney transplantation, the relevance might be higher.",
