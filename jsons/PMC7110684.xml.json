The public health consequences of imported infections include local transmission, the reestablishment of infections in areas from which they had been eliminated, or the introduction of infectious diseases into new areas with susceptible populations. Global pandemics, such as SARS in 2003, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in 2009, and more recently the MERS-CoV and Ebola outbreaks demonstrate the potential public health impact of imported infections [2], [3], [4].",

Dengue, for example, a disease connected to urbanisation and climate change [6], [7], is an increasing concern in many areas [8]. Similarly, a common vector for Chikungunya virus (Aedes albopictus) has expanded in Europe and the Americas [9], resulting in outbreaks of this disease in countries not previously affected [10]. The Zika virus epidemic affecting countries in the Western Pacific and South America [11] is another important example of the consequences of disease importations. In Australia, dengue fever outbreaks in the northern state of Queensland have been linked to imported cases [12], [13], and autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses is similarly possible due to vector presence [13]. Autochthonous mosquito-borne transmission of both dengue and chikungunya has also occurred in the United States and Europe in recent years [14], [15], while sexual transmission of Zika virus has so far been reported in New Zealand, the United States, Europe and South America [16].",

National Australian data highlights the risk of measles in partially vaccinated children [32]. Information about the date of vaccination enables examination of the proportion with up-to-date immunisation for relevant travel-related diseases and identifies cases of potential vaccine failure and waning of immunity. However this question is likely subject to recall bias and misclassification, as some patients may be reluctant to disclose that they had failed to access vaccines or may be unable to recall if and when they received specific vaccines. To enable this information to be used effectively, verification of vaccination administration is vital; otherwise this information will be unreliable. Vaccination status could be potentially validated from electronic databases kept by many GPs or travel medicine specialists and in some circumstances, vaccine registries, but such validation will often not be feasible.

Collecting data at a local rather than national level for strategy-based surveillance enables the information collected on notification forms to be targeted to the local situation, and may encourage a sense of \u201cownership\u201d amongst stakeholders that otherwise may be lost. However, ambiguity around the wording of variables and non-uniformity in the data collected means that results may not be easily comparable at a national level or between diseases. Disease-specific notification forms offer an opportunity to collect a range of disease-specific information but duplication with information collected on general surveillance form should be avoided. In New Zealand, national notification forms are specific to one disease or group of diseases with similar transmission patterns. This model could be considered by others as a way of managing competing priorities of collecting sufficient data with demands on time.",

One further limitation is that, as mentioned earlier it was judged that the 34 forms from four countries were sufficient for evaluation purposes. Local forms were not collected from Canada or the UK, and it is possible that these contain other useful and relevant variables.
