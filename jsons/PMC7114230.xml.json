            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in early November 2002 in Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. The disease soon spread worldwide infecting more than 8000 people, with more than 700 fatalities (World Health Organization, http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/en/). The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV (for reviews, see Berger et al., 2004, Christian et al., 2004, Peiris et al., 2004). SARS-CoV contains a RNA genome of \u223c30 kilobases, which encodes for up to 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). In addition to the replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and structural proteins, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope, which are common to all members of the genus coronavirus, the SARS-CoV genome also encodes eight putative proteins with no significant sequence homology to viral proteins of other known coronaviruses (i.e. ORF 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) (Marra et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003, Tan et al., 2005a). It has not yet been established which of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins are essential for viral replication and/or for viral\u2013host interactions. However, the over-expression of some of these SARS-CoV accessory proteins (3a, 7a, 3b) have been shown to induce apoptosis in cell culture (Law et al., 2005, Tan et al., 2004a, Yuan et al., 2005a), suggesting that they may play a role in viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "The second largest subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV (sgRNA3) contains two ORFs, 3a and 3b. The 3a protein has been characterized to a great extent and has been shown to be expressed in infected cells both in vitro and in vivo (Chan et al., 2005, Ito et al., 2005, Law et al., 2005, Tan et al., 2004c, Yu et al., 2004, Zeng et al., 2004). It is a novel coronavirus structural protein (Ito et al., 2005, Shen et al., 2005) and can up-regulate the expression of fibrinogen in lung cells (Tan et al., 2005b). The 3b protein is likely to be expressed via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism since its translation initiation codon is not the first AUG in sgRNA3 (Snijder et al., 2003). It has been detected in SARS-CoV infected cells (Chan et al., 2005), and anti-3b antibody has been detected in a SARS patient's serum (Guo et al., 2004), suggesting that it is expressed in vivo. The 3b protein contains two predicted nuclear localization signals and has been shown to localize to the nucleolus of transfected cells in the absence of any other SARS-CoV proteins (Yuan et al., 2005b). In addition, the over-expression of 3b causes G0/G1 arrest and induces apoptosis (Yuan et al., 2005a).",

As the 3b protein tends to form large aggregates when boiled, the SDS\u2013cell mixture was incubated at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min before Western blot analysis. For HA-Bax, the SDS\u2013cell mixture was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min.",

Here, a time-course study was performed to characterize the profile of cell-death induced by the over-expression of 3b in Vero E6 cells in order to understand the role of 3b during the viral replication cycle in Vero E6 cells. In addition, the cell-death profiles of full-length 3b and a deletion mutant, 3b\u0394124-154, which lacks the C-terminal 30 amino acids, were compared to that of Bax, a classical apoptosis inducer. The general opinion is that cell death can either be as a result of necrosis, defined as a passive and non-physiological type of death caused by accidental and acute damage to the cell, or the consequence of apoptosis, defined as an active and genetically regulated process of cell suicide by which an organism eliminates senescent, abnormal and potentially harmful cells (for reviews, see Ameison, 2002, Guimar\u00e3es and Linden, 2004, Los et al., 2002, Nelson and White, 2004, Zhivotosky, 2004). These two forms of cell death are distinguishable by their morphological and biochemical effects on the cell. However, recent studies have shown that necrosis is also highly regulated and a fine regulatory line exists between necrosis and apoptosis as many anti-apoptotic mechanisms are also effective against necrosis (for reviews, see Proskuryakov et al., 2003, Syntichaki and Tavernarakis, 2002, Syntichaki and Tavernarakis, 2003). For the sake of simplicity, we shall use the term necrosis to refer to the form of cell death not involving the apoptotic early steps, and secondary necrosis to describe the subsequent degradative changes that apoptotic cells undergo at the late stages of apoptosis.",

The expression of the proteins were detected using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1A and B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the over-expression of 3b and 3b\u0394124-154 resulted in a slight increase in caspase 3 activity, which is a hallmark of apoptosis, at 6 h post-transfection. The level of caspase 3 activity continued to increase until 12 h after transfection but showed gradual decrease at 18 and 48 h after transfection. Consistently, the expression of 3b and 3b\u0394124-154 also resulted in cleavage of endogenous PARP, which is a substrate of activated caspase-3 (Fig. 1A) from 12 h onwards. This profile mirrored that of Bax, except that the level of caspase 3 activities for 3b and 3b\u0394124-154 were lower than for Bax at all the time-points and that Bax already showed high level of caspase 3 activities and PARP cleavage at 6 h (Fig. 1B and C). These results are somewhat different from the report by Yuan et al. (2005a) where the over-expression of 3b did not induce apoptosis in Vero cells, and furthermore, showed that the C-terminal 30 amino-acids of 3b are not important for apoptosis induction. The discrepancy may be due to differences in transfection efficiency and/or sensitivity of the assays used.",

A key marker of a cell undergoing necrosis is the loss of their membrane integrity and the release of their cytoplasmic contents into the surrounding culture. Thus, the CytoTox-ONE assay (Promega), which measures the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from cells with damaged membranes, was used to quantify the degree of necrosis at different time-points. For the over-expression of 3b and 3b\u0394124-154, significant amounts of LDH were released as early as 6 h post-transfection as compared to the low level of LDH released from mock transfected cells (Fig. 1D). The levels of LDH then increased gradually up to 12 h. Interestingly, the level of LDH released from cells expressing Bax was about the same as for 3b and 3b\u0394124-154 at 6 h, 12 h and 18 h, even though the level of apoptosis caused by the over-expression of Bax was consistently higher that caused by 3b or 3b\u0394124-154. The gradual increase in the level of necrosis in the Bax expressing cells was expected as apoptotic cells would undergo secondary necrosis at the late stages (Ameison, 2002, Guimar\u00e3es and Linden, 2004, Los et al., 2002, Nelson and White, 2004, Zhivotosky, 2004). These results showed that the expression of 3b induces necrosis as early as 6 h post-transfection when the level of apoptosis was very much lower than that for Bax. Again, the C-terminal 30 amino acids of 3b do not have any effects on its ability to induce necrosis. At time-points greater than 6 h post-infection, it appears that both necrosis and apoptosis (and secondary necrosis) were occurring simultaneously in cell over-expressing 3b or 3b\u0394124-154. At 48 h post-transfection, there was a surge of LDH release from cells expressing 3b or 3b\u0394124-154 or Bax or even the mock transfected cells, indicating that by this time, the Lipofectamine reagent used for transfection had some unspecific cytotoxic effects or the cells were over-grown (Fig. 1D).

Consistent with the fractionation experiments above, indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the 3b protein was localized primarily in the nucleolus of transfected cells and somewhat less around the nucleus. The latter is likely to be the nuclear membrane as 3b was isolated in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3A). In contrast, 3b\u0394124-154 was localized to the perinuclear regions, while Bax was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm. Since the fractionation experiments showed that 3b\u0394124-154 was found predominantly in the membrane and nuclear fractions at late time-points (Fig. 3B), it is likely that the intense staining around the nucleus represents both perinuclear membranous organelles, like the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, as well as nuclear membrane, with the latter being partitioned into the nuclear fraction. Amino acids 134\u2013154 of 3b have been previously shown to contain a nucleolar localization signal (Yuan et al., 2005b). Consistently, we observed that unlike full-length 3b, the 3b\u0394124-154 mutant was not efficiently transported to the nucleolus.",

At all the time-points analysed, the apoptosis induced by the expression of 3b was less than the level induced by Bax but the level of necrosis was comparable to that induced by over-expression of Bax. Hence, it is clear that 3b induces necrosis at the early time-point and apoptosis (and secondary necrosis) at late time-points. The deletion mutant 3b\u0394124-154 behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of 3b does not seems to be important for the cell-death pathways since full-length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus, while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions.",

(2005) showed by reverse genetics experiment that recombinant virus containing a deletion of the ORF3a, which resulted in the movement of ORF3b to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA and an increase in the level of 3b expression, has a lower viral yield than wild-type virus. On the other hand, if both 3a and 3b are deleted, there is no significant difference from wild-type virus, thus suggesting that the over-expression of 3b may have a deleterious effect on viral yield (Yount et al., 2005). It remains to be determined if the necrotic effect on the cells caused by the over-expression of 3b could play a part in reducing the viral titre. Interestingly, Hussain et al. (2005) reported that the 3b protein can also be expressed from an independent subgenomic RNA but this is a rare event. Given the findings that over-expression of 3b can cause rapid necrosis and may reduce virus titer in cell culture systems, it is crucial to further understand how the expression level of 3b is modulated during SARS-CoV infection.",

However, the role of necrosis in viral infection is less clear, partly because the necrosis process is less well-studied. Nevertheless, to date, necrosis has been shown to play an important role during viral infection by at least four viruses (An et al., 2000, Espinoza et al., 2005, Miller and Fox, 2004, Ran et al., 1999). Whether or not necrosis is important for SARS-CoV infection remains to be determined. Interestingly, necrosis was observed in different tissues obtained from SARS-CoV infected patients (Chong et al., 2004, Ding et al., 2003, Lang et al., 2003, Xu et al., 2005) and many SARS-CoV infected laboratory animals, including cynomologus macaques (Fouchier et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003), rhesus macaques (Qin et al., 2005), common marmosets (Greenough et al., 2005), golden syrian hamster (Roberts et al., 2005b) and aged BALB/c mice (Roberts et al., 2005a). However, necrosis was not observed in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Yan et al., 2004), suggesting that the level of 3b may not be sufficient to induce necrosis in Vero E6 cells. However, we cannot rule out that the expression of 3b may be higher in SARS patients and/or SARS-CoV infected animals than in SARS-CoV infected cell culture. Further studies using animal models will be necessary to give a more definitive answer.",

(C) The cellular localization of HA-3b, HA-3b\u0394124-154, HA-Bax were analysed by indirect immunofluorescence at 18 h post-transfection. Mock transfected cells showed the specificity of the anti-HA monoclonal antibody.",
