            "text": "A first step during infection is the attachment of microorganisms to various host proteins, which could include basement membrane (BM) proteins. Generally, adhesion of bacteria and fungi occurs through binding of adhesive molecules, called adhesins, to host proteins. Most adhesins are extensively described and some of the motifs participating in these processes have been identified. In comparison, knowledge about adhesion of viruses to BM components is scarce. On adhesion, microorganisms have evolved cunning techniques to overcome the BM barrier, which otherwise hampers their invasive process. Breakdown of the BM, via activation of microbial and/or host proteases, to cross the BM has been shown for many bacteria, fungi and, recently, some viruses. Pathogens might also gain access to the connective tissue by hijacking host cells, particularly local immune cells, to cross the BM. This review provides an overview of recent insights into different pathogen\u2013BM interactions during host invasion, discusses these findings and projects how they could contribute to the design of novel strategies to interfere with microbial invasions and pathology.",

            "text": "The BM provides a subtle interface between epithelial or endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells present in connective tissue. Besides providing tissue structure, the BM plays an important role in structural integrity, cell behavior and signaling [1]. In proximity to epithelial cells, BM components such as collagen XVII and laminin 5, 6 and 10 are linked to extracellular parts of different molecules, mainly belonging to the integrin family (e.g. \u03b16\u03b24, \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b19\u03b21) and fibronectin network, present on basolateral cell surfaces. At the cellular\u2013matrix interface, located underneath the cell-neighboring elements collagen IV, VII and XVIII, laminin 1, entactin/nidogen, BM-40/osteonectin, fibulins and proteoglycans such as bamacan, agrin, perlecan are abundant. Towards the lamina propria, collagen I, III, V and VI appear next to proteoglycans. Overall, the BM represents a firm network of the main components, collagen and laminin, bridged by various other components (Figure 1\n). Importantly, the average pore size in the collagen\u2013laminin network is approximately 50 nm, which allows only very small particles to diffuse across this thin but firm barrier 2, 3. This implies that microorganisms have devised ways to cross the BM.",

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glycoprotein gp43 of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis bind type I collagen. Gp43 also binds type IV collagens and laminin, probably via a sialic acid recognition system, similar to A. fumigatus\n[24].

In brief, through the activity of the two main physiological plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen is converted to plasmin, which degrades laminin and fibronectin and activates precursors of MMPs. Several bacterial pathogens express plasminogen receptors, thereby recruiting plasminogen to the bacterial surface, which leads to enhanced plasminogen activation. In addition, some bacteria bind and/or induce uPA or tPA 43, 45 and/or express bacterial plasminogen activators. Moreover, some bacteria inactivate plasmin inhibitors [46].",

Fusobacterium nucleatum can invade the BM in a strain-dependent manner by binding plasminogen [48] and pro-MMP9 and stimulating MMP9 and MMP13 secretion [49]. Helicobacter pylori induces expression of the cysteine protease cathepsin X in gastric epithelial cells and macrophages. In epithelial cells, H. pylori induces morphological and motility changes, partly via MMP9 [50] and probably also via other proteases. The mechanisms by which H. pylori induces expression of proteases in epithelial cells and macrophages is unknown. It has been suggested that proteolytic activities play a role in gastric tumorigenesis [50]. H. pylori also increases expression of the uPA system in gastric epithelial cells [51]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n18, 52 and Neisseria meningitidis\n45, 53 modulate both MMPs (MMP8 and MMP9, respectively) and the plasminogen\u2013plasmin system. Both morphotypes of Peptostreptococcus micros possess plasminogen receptors. For P. micros, both bacterial (streptokinase) and human plasminogen activators (uPA) can activate plasminogen to plasmin. Rough morphotypes also possess chymotrypsin-like and gelatinase serine proteases [54]. Porphyromonas gingivalis upregulates MMPs, modulates the plasminogen\u2013plasmin system and expresses cysteine protease gingipains. Gingipains contribute to BM penetration, either directly or by modulating MMP2 and MMP9 [55]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses an MMP and modulates the plasminogen\u2013plasmin system [56]. Treponema pallidum expresses an MMP-like and serine protease [57], induces MMPs and modulates the plasminogen\u2013plasmin system [43]. Vibrio spp. express both MMPs and serine proteases [58].",

            "text": "It has also been reported that viruses modulate host-derived proteolytic activity to alter barrier properties of BMs, thereby enhancing viral dissemination (Figure 2). Most viral-induced alterations of BMs involve MMPs. The latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) induces MMP9 and uPA [65]. Hepatitis B virus x protein (HBx) drives MMP14 expression [66]. It has been reported that HPV induces MMP2, MMP9 and MMP14 [67]. The glycoprotein K1 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) modulates the production of MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9 [68]. Apart from the involvement of viral-induced proteolytic activities in EBV-, hepatitis B virus-, HPV- and KSHV-induced metastasis, it is unclear at present whether this induction plays a role in viral pathogenesis. A similar mechanism is observed in human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-1)-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, in which MMP9 expression is increased in HTLV-1-infected malignant cells 69, 70. HTLV-I encephalitis is associated with MMP2 and MMP9 [70]. Other viral infections have also been implicated in neurological conditions because of their involvement in BBB impairment by damaging the vascular BM. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) induces collagenase type IV secretion, which may lead to BM degradation and subsequent release of infected endothelial cells into the circulation and access into the CNS [71]. Viral hijacking of immune cells might also modulate vascular permeability. Bunyaviridae (Andes virus, ANDV), Dengue virus, HIV and West Nile virus (WNV) enhance dendritic cell (DC) maturation, MMP9 expression and plasma vascular leakage [72]. MMP9 is also upregulated in both the periphery and brain on WNV infection and is partly localized to brain blood vessels. WNV may enter the brain directly through the BBB or may be carried within infected leukocytes (described in the next section). WNV also upregulates MMP1 and MMP3 [73]. Coronaviruses can also induce MMPs in susceptible cells and have been associated with multiple sclerosis-like disease in rodents. However, the role of MMPs in coronavirus CNS infection is unknown [74]. Finally, it has been postulated that bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV-5) entry the CNS is facilitated by leukocytes and MMP9. However, induction of MMP9 expression by BHV-5 has not been directly demonstrated so far [75].",

Then these protrusions elongate in the degraded zone and infiltrate the underlying compartment. It is believed that the rod-like shape of invadopodia allows for focal delivery of proteases to restrictive areas of the BM [77]. Although the primary function of immune cells is to sample pathogens to initiate an immune response, over time, several pathogens have developed mechanisms to use these cells as Trojan horses to cross the BM barrier and disseminate throughout the host. Mechanisms of intracellular survival involving inhibition of immune cell activation via alteration of their phenotype and function contribute to cell migration according to direct and indirect evidence [78].",

DCs and Langerhans cells (LCs), an epidermal DC subtype, are located at mucosal or epidermal sites of entry for many viruses, such as herpesviruses, immunodeficiency viruses and HPV, and are thus of key importance in infections with these viruses. Initial infection of epidermal cells with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) results in infection of resident LCs. After infection, a decrease in epidermal LC density and a corresponding increase in the number of langerin-positive cells in the underlying dermis has been noted, arguing for HSV-induced LC migration from the epidermal layer [91]. During primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV), another herpesvirus, DCs of the respiratory mucosa can transport VZV to human tonsillar CD4+ T lymphocytes, followed by T lymphocyte-mediated dissemination in the host [92]. HIV might use LCs for trans-epithelial transport of HIV to susceptible CD4+ T cells [93]. Measles virus (MV) is another virus that uses DCs to gain access to its main target cells in lymphoid tissues [94]. As described earlier, ANDV, Dengue virus, HIV and WNV hijack DCs [72].",

Indeed, immune cells produce a large amount of proteases on stimulation at sites of inflammation and this might rupture important barriers such as the BM, allowing pathogens access to deeper tissues. However, inflammation increases the risk that pathogens will be neutralized by the immune system.Box 1Outstanding questions\n\u2022For what reason did certain pathogens, which might even belong to the same family, evolve different mechanisms of invasion?

Alternatively, is tissue tropism driven by the invasion skills of a pathogen? How different are the BM composition and barrier function in different tissues of different species?\u2022To what extent does inflammation really play a role in aiding pathogen invasion through the BM?

Moreover, it is important to know that different microbial invasive strategies might have synergistic effects on one another. Indeed, interactions between adhesion and proteolytic activity-mediating mechanisms to improve and enhance pathogen invasion have been described [99]. In some bacteria, production of proteases might even depend on quorum sensing [100]. Taking this possibility into account, hampering of bacterial adhesion might also influence proteolytic activity. Mechanisms underpinning binding to and breakdown of the BM are generally better understood for bacteria and fungi than for viruses. Hence, it will be interesting to identify possible viral factors that are required for efficient penetration through the BM and ECM. If protease activity plays a role, as described recently for a herpesvirus [76], then the use of protease inhibitors might be a useful strategy. However, to further develop the potential of proteases as antimicrobial targets, there is a need for identification of all signals, factors and domains involved during microbial invasion. Compounds that interfere with pathogen hijacking of migratory cells or limit interactions of metastatic cells with ECM elements could, if locally applied, provide an interesting way to prevent or delay further microbial invasion.",
