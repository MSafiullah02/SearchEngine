            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospitals to progressively reduce surgical volumes to both minimize disease transmission within the hospital, and to preserve human and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other resources needed to care for COVID-19 patients. In response, many hospitals have abruptly reduced or eliminated elective surgeries. As the COVID-19 burden on a hospital increases, procedures that improve survival may similarly have to be reduced or eliminated (i.e. semi-elective, urgent, and perhaps some emergent operations). For some cancer patients, surgery may be delayed for months, or even years without negative consequences. However, in other scenarios, failure to perform an indicated cancer surgery in timely fashion may have long term implications on a patient's survivorship or significant permanent deficits in their quality of life. Therefore, cancer patients and the oncology teams that treat them are likely to face difficult decisions between suboptimal management strategies. Thoracic oncology decisions are further complicated by the fact most of the patients with lung, esophageal and other thoracic malignancies would be considered to be a \"high risk\" group for poor outcomes with COVID-19 (advanced age, emphysema, heart disease). Further, the indicated therapeutic procedures can both impair lung function (i.e. lung isolation, removal of lung tissue), and expose clinical teams to aerosolized viral load (bronchoscopy, double-lumen endotracheal tube placement , airway surgery, laparoscopy and possibly lung surgery particularly with parenchymal lung leaks). We have assembled a document to offer guidance, intended to facilitate these difficult decisions when caring for patients with thoracic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1) .",

There is a great deal of uncertainty around this evolving pandemic and information may change rapidly. -Critical portions of the transition are not addressed. In reality, there is likely to be a Phase \"1a\", \"1b\", \"1c\", where only fraction of the priority cancer patients may have access to surgery. Clinicians may have to further restrict of surgery, likely across specialties (i.e. colon cancer, breast, hepatobiliary) based on the perceived magnitude of risk of delay, and over shorter time periods (i.e. impact of 8-week delay, then 4 weeks, etc).",

A partnership was formed between the CoC (Tim Mullett, Larry Shulman, Linda Martin and Matt Facktor), the Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network (ThORN -a research collective of board-certified general thoracic surgeons) and leaders from the American College of Surgeons (Heidi Nelson, Valerie Rusch, Douglas Wood), and reviewed by leadership from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American Association of Thoracic Surgery (David Jones and Shaf Keshavjee). The limited data was discussed in an open exchange and the resulting guide is best characterized as being basedon \"expert opinion\" (in terms of strength of evidence). The authors recognize that multiple resources are becoming available to triage all types of surgical treatment. We intentionally avoided language that is currently being used to structure guidance based on procedures (i.e. tiers) or patient status (i.e. emergent, urgent, semi-urgent) to avoid confusion, and have instead organized recommendations based on the conditions that exist within each hospital (\"phases\").",
