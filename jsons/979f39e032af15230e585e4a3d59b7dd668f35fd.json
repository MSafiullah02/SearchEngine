It is interesting that for a respiratory pathogen, risk of mortality seems to be lower for those with underlying respiratory disease than with pre-existing cardiac pathology. Moreover, the data cited by Dr Stein suggest that pre-existing diabetes is a higher risk for mortality than lung disease, and that pre-existing hypertension confers almost the same risk of death from COVID-19 as underlying lung disease. These findings are unexpected, and surely worthy of further exploration.",

They note that at present this agent is licenced for human use in Japan to treat an unrelated condition. Equally, it is possible that intervening with an agent which inhibits the ACE receptors may confer therapeutic benefit in those suffering from COVID-19. 5 However, one cannot help but speculate that the increased and somewhat unexpected mortality risk from COVID-19",

            "text": "I would be most interested in Dr Stein's observation on whether urgent trials of this agent in an attempt to combat the rapid advance on COVID-19 are merited?Returning to the mortality data cited by Dr Stein, the potential link between ACE 2 receptors, cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension perhaps also merits more thought. In each of these groups of patients, treatment with agents which have an impact on the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is very common. It has been shown that these treatments can up-regulate ACE 2 receptor expression in humans,4,5 and it is thus theoretically possible that pre-existing use of these drugs might predispose a person to infection with a greater viral load of SARS-Cov-2 as a result of greater ACE 2 receptor expression.",
