We diagnosed SARS according to the World Health Organization criteria [15], on the basis ofthe following symptoms: acute onset of fever (138\u00b0C) accompanied by frequent chills or rigor, dyspnea, headache, myalgia, hypoxemia, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. In addition, the patients with SARS had anti-SARS CoV IgG antibodies detected by use of an IFA [3], which showed seroconversion or a 4-fold increase in titer. In this assay, which uses virus-infected monkey kidney (Vero) cells and which is performed routinely in our laboratory, a serum titer of \u2a7d1:40 was considered to be positive. All 46 patients (15 males and 31 females; age range, 8\u201368 years; mean\u00b1SD age, 35.9\u00b113.0 years) had contact with patients with confirmed SARS within 10 days of the onset of their symptoms and were admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, during the SARS outbreak that started in early March 2003. Two of the patients died, 5 required intensive carebut eventually recovered, and the rest had a mild clinical course. Because methods of detection were not available early during the outbreak, the SARS CoV was cultured from only 1 patient, and viral RNA was detected by use of reverse-transcription polymerasechain reaction (PCR) [16] from the respiratory or stool samples from 4 patients. The serum samples used in the present study were obtained 7\u201335 days (mean\u00b1SD, 17.1\u00b16.4 days) after the onset of fever.",

First, when the crude viral extract was used as antigen, 91% of the patients with SARS were positive for antibodies, compared with <6% of the combined control subjects (figure 2). All 4 patients with SARS who were negative for antibodies had low IFA titers (<1:80). All serum samples were not reactive with the control antigen, GST (data not shown). The results are based on the IgG response. The IgM response, in contrast, was less robust and less frequent (43%) among the patients with SARS (figure 2) and less discriminatory between the SARS and non-SARS cohorts. Second, we made a recombinant antigen of the N-terminal half of the N protein (rNa), and, when it was used in an IgG ELISA, we found results almost identical to those found with the crude viral extract (89% sensitivity and 94%\u201395% specificity), including 4 negative cases in common (figure 2). The IgM responses were similarly low and infrequent among the patients with SARS (data not shown).",

To investigate this possibility, we performed WB experiments using rNa as inhibitor. rNa was indeed found to reduce the reactivity of not only N1, but also of N2 and N3 (figure 3A). In fact, inhibition was greatest with N3 and least with N1. Of interest, there appeared to be a fourth, minor N fragment (N4) with a molecular weight of 32 kDa (figure 3A) that was seen with some serum samples (e.g., S13; figure 1). Similar results were obtained when the purified N2 and N3 antigens were used as the inhibitor in the WB analysis (figure 3A).

This result was not due to the fact that we used a single dilution measurement in the ELISA, rather than titrating the serum (figure 4C). It is possible that some antigens cannot be extracted from the cell or become degraded during the extraction, but this was not the case with NSP12 or NSP9. It is noteworthy that the serum samples from the 3 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, which reacted with the (presumably) N1 component by WB, were negative by the rNa ELISA.

An exaggerated T cell response probably also accounts for the pneumonia-associated immunopathology seen in patients with SARS [10]. The N antigen may be important here. It may indeed be both a potent B cell and a potent T cell immunogen; that is, an important candidate for a vaccine. Although antibodies to the nucleocapsid are nonneutralizing, whether such antibodies can be protective in other ways, as observed for mouse hepatitis virus [20] and rotavirus [21], needs to be addressed formally. The latter phenomenon maybe due to the ability of the IgA antibodies to enter the infected cell by the IgA-transcytosis pathway, thereby interfering with viral transcription [14].",
