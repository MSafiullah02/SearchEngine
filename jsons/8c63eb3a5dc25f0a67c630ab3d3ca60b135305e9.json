However, T-cell function in vivo is generally analyzed indirectly, or is extrapolated from in vitro studies under nonphysiologic oxygen tensions. In this study, we delineate the role of physiologic and pathologic oxygen tension in vitro during reactivation and differentiation of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells. Using CD8 + T cells from pmel-1 mice, we observed that the generation of CTLs under 5% O 2 , which corresponds to physioxia in lymph nodes, gave rise to a higher effector signature than those generated under atmospheric oxygen fractions (21% O 2 ). Hypoxia (1% O 2 ) did not modify cytotoxicity, but decreasing O 2 tensions during CTL and CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte reactivation dose-dependently decreased proliferation, induced secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, and upregulated the expression of CD137 (4-1BB) and CD25. Overall, our data indicate that oxygen tension is a key regulator of CD8 + T-cell function and fate and suggest that IL-10 release may be an unanticipated component of CD8 + T cell-mediated immune responses in most in vivo microenvironments.",

Upon stabilization, HIFs transcribe various genes with HIF-responsive elements in their promoter; these include those that increase angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF) and glucose metabolism (e.g. glucose transporters) [9] . Interestingly, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 can have unique, redundant, or opposing roles [9, 10] . Furthermore, while HIF-1\u03b1 is described to be stabilized and active below 2% O 2 in an acute manner, HIF-2\u03b1 has been shown to be stable below 5% O 2 in a chronic manner [11, 12] . However, although HIFs are central to many hypoxia responses, certain effects have been shown to be HIF-independent [13] [14] [15] . Intriguingly, HIF-1\u03b1 can also be involved in immune cell activation under atmospheric oxygen fractions (AtO 2 ; i.e. 21%), as reported for macrophages and T cells [16, 17] .",

When exploring hypoxia, one has to compare hypoxic to normoxic conditioning. However, most published studies consider AtO 2 as normoxia [1] . This could lead to misinterpretation, as, for example, physiological oxygen fraction (physioxia) found in secondary lymphoid organs is close to 5% O 2 and can induce differential T lymphocyte activation as compared to AtO 2 in vitro [18] [19] [20] . This highlights the necessity to not only use physioxia as a reference point to study hypoxia impact in vitro, but also to analyze cell physiology in general. Physioxia in tissues varies greatly: e.g. skin 1.1%, brain 4.4%, pulmonary alveoli 14.5% (Supporting Information Fig. 1A ) [3] . As a baseline for physioxia in healthy tissues, 5% O 2 was previously used for assessing lymphocyte function [19] ; we also selected this compromise value for our study.",

In cancer, hypoxia promotes tumor cell stemness, migration, invasiveness, metastasis, and resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and to CTL-mediated killing [10, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In viral infection, hypoxia increases viral replication and gene expression [26] . To date, the impact of hypoxia on T cells implicated in anti-tumor and anti-viral immunity is not extensively described. Most studies focused on CD4 + T cells, without consensus regarding the effects. Earlier studies suggested a positive correlation between hypoxia and viability or proliferation [27, 28] , more recent studies showed the opposite [29, 30] . Hypoxia was also shown to increase Th17 and Treg polarization [31, 32] . Concerning cytokine production, there are conflicting results for secretion of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-1\u03b2 [29, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Overall, despite certain contradictions in this emerging research area, the knowledge base for CD4 + T cells is becoming more comprehensive. The impact of hypoxia and oxygen tensions on CD8 + T cells is restricted to a few interesting studies [17, 18, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . However, there are many issues regarding the reactivation of already primed CD8 + T cells (hereafter considered as CTLs) that require further investigation. It is particularly important to understand CTL responses to hypoxia because, in contrast to certain Th subsets, these cells must function in the most oxygen-deprived sites in the body (e.g. tumor bed, sites of infection).",

Gene expression analysis of reactivated CTLs underlined the importance of using physioxia instead of AtO 2 as a normoxia reference, as many genes described to be modulated under hypoxia were already regulated under physioxia. Our investigations of immune function under oxygen deprivation revealed that whereas hypoxia did not modify CTL killing capacities, it potently induced IL-10 secretion upon reactivation, and dramatically decreased CTL expansion.",

To model a physiologic effector CD8 + T-cell response, we first generated CTLs under physioxia (5% O 2 ), as found in LNs, and compared them to CTLs generated under AtO 2 (i.e. 21% O 2 ).

            "text": "We analyzed the expression of a panel of 42 genes described to be either regulated under hypoxia, to be immune-function related, or to be involved in cell survival (Supporting Information  Table 1 ). Relative to 21% O 2 , the physioxic oxygen fraction (5% O 2 ) that was used during CTL generation upregulated RNA expression of different genes described to be increased by hypoxia. These included hif1a exon I.1 (albeit weakly expressed, as judged by Nanostring absolute RNA counts (data not shown)), hif2a, vegfa, glut1, entpd1 (CD39), galectin3, gelsolin, and tnfrsf9 (CD137). However, hif1a, adora2a (A2AR), and hif1b were not modulated, hif3a was not expressed, while nt5e (CD73) was downregulated [11, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] (Fig. 1A) . Several genes positively associated with CD8 + T cell survival and expansion were upregulated, including gata3, il2ra, and cd28 [51] [52] [53] . However, maf and ctla4, associated with increased apoptosis and immune regulation [54, 55] , were also upregulated. It was noteworthy that CTLs generated under physioxia showed a higher effector profile, evidenced by blimp1 and fasl upregulation, and tcf7 downregulation (Fig. 1B) . Consistent with these observations, CTLs generated under normoxia showed increase of the CD44 + CD62Lfraction (Fig. 1C ) and a decrease of CD127 (IL-7R\u03b1) expression (Supporting Information Figs. 1C and 2A). This was not due to the CD8 + T-cell clone used, as OT-I CTLs and polyclonal CTLs from C57BL/6 gave the same results (Supporting Information Fig. 2B-D) . Accordingly, CTLs generated under physioxia had increased killing capacities as compared to CTLs generated under AtO 2 (Supporting Information Fig. 2E ). We next investigated whether hypoxia (1% O 2 ) could impact CTL lytic capacities. Independently of the oxygen fraction used during CTL generation, hypoxia during the cytotoxicity assay had no effect (Supporting Information Fig. 2E ). As this assay implies a short-term hypoxia exposure (4 h), we also preconditioned the CTLs three days before carrying out the killing assay. Interestingly, CTLs generated under AtO 2 and that were preconditioned under hypoxia showed increased cytotoxicity (Fig. 1D) . However, CTLs generated under physioxia and that were preconditioned under hypoxia did not augment their killing capacities. GranzymeB (GrB) was preferentially expressed by CTLs that were generated under physioxia as compared to those generated under AtO 2 (Supporting Information Fig. 2F -G), consistent with the increase in effector versus memory differentiation that we Pmel-1 splenocytes were generated under 21% (black bars) or 5% O 2 (gray bars) and were analyzed for RNA expression. Results represent (A) the mean relative gene expression or (B) the RNA absolute count + SEM of five independent experiments (n = 5). The checkerboard represents the 42 genes analyzed (only genes modulated by more than 30% with a p < 0.05 are colored in red or blue). (C and D) CTLs from Pmel-1 splenocytes were generated under O 2 fractions as indicated and were analyzed for marker expression by flow cytometry. (C) CTLs were stained for CD62L and CD44, gated on live CD8 + cells, at day 0, day 3, and day 6 postpriming. Dot plots show one representative experiment at day. Line graph shows the mean percentage \u00b1 SEM CD44 + CD62Lcells among CTLs from at least four independent experiments (n \u08d9 4). (D) CTLs generated under 21 and 5% were preconditioned for 3 days under 21 (\"21 to 21%\"), 5 (\"5 to 5%\") or 1% (\"21 to 1%\" and \"5 to 1%\") O 2 . The resulting CTLs were assessed for their capacity to kill EL-4 tumor target cells pulsed with hgp100 (Pmel-1 CTLs; n \u08d9 4) or Ova peptide (OT-I CTLs; n = 3) for 4 h under the oxygen fraction used for preconditioning. Results show the mean \u00b1 SEM specific lysis of tumor cells from at least three independent experiments. ns: not statistically significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (A, B: Three-way ANOVA; C, D: Student's t-test).",

CTLs reactivated for two days under hypoxia showed increased expression of il10 and tnfrsf9 (CD137), and to a lesser extent bcl2, hif2a, and il2ra (CD25). Of all genes analyzed, il10 was the most modulated under hypoxia, independently of the oxygen fraction used as normoxia reference. RNA expression kinetics for il10, ifng, tnfrsf9 (CD137), il2ra (CD25), and hif2a (Supporting Information Fig. 5A -E) indicated a strong upregulation of RNA levels by two days postreactivation, then a decrease, although hif2a RNA expression was more stable. For all these genes there was a negative correlation between oxygen fractions and RNA expression. Concerning bcl2 RNA (Supporting Information Fig. 5F ), its expression was decreased from two days postreactivation, but it was more stable under hypoxia. In order to know whether these modulations were due to hypoxia itself or to a combination of hypoxia plus TCR stimulation, we analyzed expression of the same panel of genes by CTLs cultured for two days without stimulation (Supporting Information Fig. 6A -D).There was no upregulation of il10, hif2a, or il2ra, showing that hypoxia-driven upregulation of these molecules is dependent on TCR stimulation.

Lowering oxygen tension increased the fraction of IL-10 producing CTLs (Fig. 3C , D), the IL-10-positive fraction also coexpressed IFN-\u03b3. However, whereas hypoxia augmented the IFN-\u03b3-positive fraction as compared to AtO 2 , it did not significantly increase this fraction as compared to physioxia (Fig. 3D) . Analysis of secreted IL-10 indicated weak secretion under AtO 2 , moderate induction by physioxia, and potent induction by hypoxia (Fig. 3E ). Using CD8 + T cells from OT-I and C57BL/6 mice yielded the same results (Supporting Information Fig. 7E and G). Thus, these data suggest that IL-10 is a typical CTL cytokine following reactivation under physioxia, and that its secretion is further increased under hypoxia. However, IL-10 is not a cytokine secreted after primary activation of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells, even when primed under physioxia or hypoxia (data not shown). We next tested whether IL-10 secretion was responsible for the decreased cell expansion under hypoxia; using an IL-10-blocking antibody during CTL reactivation did not restore expansion under hypoxia (Fig. 3F) . Thus, hypoxia impacts on the cytokine secretion profile of CTLs, but at least for IL-10, without autocrine consequences. We did not observe any hypoxia-related increase in expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, or TNF-\u03b1 ( Fig. 3G -I, Supporting Information Fig. 7F and H) . Of note, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-17 were undetectable after CTL restimulation (data not shown).",

To show that CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) indeed express CD25, CD137, and IL-10 in vivo, we purified CD8 + TILs and compared them to CD8 + T cells from spleen. Whereas in the spleen, CD25 and CD137 were not expressed, \u00df13% of CD8 + TILs were CD25 + and \u00df30% were CD137 + (Fig. 4A) , with most CD25 + cells coexpressing CD137. As IL-10 protein cannot be observed easily without in vitro cell manipulation, we looked at il10 RNA. Expression was higher in CD8 + TILs as compared to CD8 + splenocytes (Fig. 4B) ; moreover, hif2a was also overexpressed. As indicated by scatter graphs showing correlation between CD8 + purity and il10 mRNA (Supporting Information Fig. 8C ), il10 mRNA expression was not from contaminating non-T cells such as tumor cells or macrophages. In order to confirm that oxygen fraction is a major regulator of CD8 + TIL expansion, and of CD25, CD137, and IL-10 expression, we reactivated CD8 + TILs ex vivo with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated beads under varying oxygen fractions (i.e. 21, 5, and 1%). As we previously described using in vitro generated CTLs, expansion, and viability correlated positively with oxygen levels (Fig. 4C) . Finally, confirming our in vitro data, we observed that CD25, CD137 (Fig. 4D) , and most importantly IL-10, were negatively correlated with oxygen levels (Fig. 4E) . Importantly, upregulation of these molecules under hypoxia needed a combination of TCR-ligation plus hypoxia (Fig. 4D, E) .

Consistent with the effector versus memory profiling, CTLs generated under physioxia were more lytic than those generated at 21% O 2 , suggesting that CTL generation under AtO 2 (e.g. for adoptive therapy) could be suboptimal. This is consistent with previous reported increased granzyme A expression and cytotoxicity of T cells preactivated under physiologic oxygen tensions [18, 59] . This might also be linked to increased HIF activity under physioxia, as HIFs were described to increase CTL effector function [17, 41] . Our results show that physioxia (as found in secondary lymphoid organs) facilitates efficacious CD8 + T-cell expansion and differentiation, and that in vitro analyses under AtO 2 poorly mimic these in vivo conditions. Of particular interest, eight important genes described to be hypoxia-regulated, including the widely reported Vegfa and Glut1 genes, were regulated even under the physiologic oxygen value that we chose as physioxia (i.e. 5%), as compared to AtO 2 . The impact of oxygen tensions is relevant to understand T-cell priming under physioxia [18, 19] , even if na\u00efve T cells only rarely enter hypoxic sites as in the tumor bed [60, 61] . Na\u00efve and effector T cells will be expected to differ in their sensitivity to activation stimuli since they are phenotypically distinct, and possess unique metabolic patterns (e.g. glucose and cysteine requirements) [17, 62] .",

However, the critical issues of their survival, expansion, and function under such in vivo relevant conditions were seldom addressed [17, 41] . In agreement with previous studies [38, 40] , we observed that hypoxia did not modify CTL killing capacities in a short-term assay, regardless of the oxygen tension used for CTL generation. Nevertheless, we noticed that preconditioning for three days under hypoxia of CTLs generated under AtO 2 increased their lytic capacities. Importantly, we showed that CTL expansion following reactivation was strongly decreased under hypoxia, with both decreased viability and proliferation. We hypothesized that the underlying defect may be linked to disturbed IL-2R signaling, as recently shown in CD4 + T cells [30] , but addition of exogenous IL-2 to CD8 + TILs did not restore proliferation under hypoxia (Supporting Information Fig. 8D) , despite elevated expression of CD25. Another explanation could be hypoxia-induced immune regulation through adenosine-A2AR signaling [46, 63] . However, our results (with reactivated CD8 + T cells) are more in line with a recent publication showing a hypoxia-induced A2AR-independent decrease of cell expansion [42] , since we observed neither CD25, nor Fasl downregulation that characterizes adenosinergic-induced immunosuppression [63, 64] . However, in an in vivo microenvironment where adenosine levels have been shown to be high, hypoxia-induced adenosinergic-dependent and independent inhibition of T-cell expansion might occur concomitantly.",

However, as compared to physioxia, hypoxia was much less potent, modulating expression of only five of the 42 genes. Nevertheless, all of these genes overlapped with those identified as being modulated following switching cells from atmospheric to hypoxic conditions. Among these, two of the upregulated genes that we confirmed to be overexpressed at the protein level, tnf-srf9 (CD137) and il2ra (CD25), were previously reported to be hypoxia-regulated [18, 30, 44] . Of particular interest, from the whole panel of genes analyzed, il10 was the most highly modulated gene by CTLs under hypoxia.

This was only observed for effector CD8 + T cells, as the priming of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells under hypoxia did not lead to IL-10 secretion (data not shown). Since we observed negligible secretion of IL-10 by CTLs reactivated under AtO 2 , our results suggest that this capacity of CTLs is underestimated by conventional in vitro methodology, but will likely occur in vivo in many tissues, as we observed for il10expressing CD8 + TILs. In the limited number of reports concerning IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells that we are aware of, most have been in the context of infection: coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, chronic mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and respiratory viral infection [65] [66] [67] [68] . CTL-produced IL-10 has been suggested as a feedback mechanism to dampen immunopathology caused by excessive cytolytic and inflammatory activity [69] . Our results support such a function, since hypoxia is a feature of infected tissues [7] . However, although IL-10 is mainly known for its immunosuppressive activity, some studies have shown immunostimulatory effects [70] . We did not observe any stimulatory or inhibitory effects of IL-10 on CTL-expansion under hypoxia, but in a complex in vivo microenvironment, it could act in a paracrine manner on other immune cells, or on tumor cells. In malignancy, the role of IL-10 is still a matter of debate, with promotion of tumor immune surveillance being reported [71] , but also correlation with poor prognosis, increased cancer recurrence, and metastasis [72] . It will be critical to determine in future studies whether IL-10 produced by tumor-specific CTLs can impact on their therapeutic efficacy.",

The use of monoclonal CD8 + T cells with identical sensitivity to ligands precluded the potential drawback of selection of certain clones within polyclonal T cells because of increased fitness or affinity at a given oxygen tension. Nevertheless, our major findings were similar in polyclonal C57BL/6-derived CD8 + CTLs and CD8 + TILs. Our data challenges the use of AtO 2 as normoxia in order to determine the in vivo impact of hypoxia in vitro. Overall, we show that even if hypoxia does not disturb lytic capacities of CTLs, it could diminish antitumor or antiviral responses in vivo through a negative impact on CD8 + T cell fate and the induction of IL-10 secretion that could act in a paracrine manner on other immune cell types or tissues. If IL-10 released by CTLs is dampening inflammatory responses in hypoxic tissues in vivo, this may be a valuable feedback mechanism to limit immunopathology in infection, but it is likely to blunt tumor immunosurveillance or immunotherapy.",
