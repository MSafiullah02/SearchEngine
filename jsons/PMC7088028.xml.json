In the present research we are coupling the biological activity of organotin moieties with the biologically active acyclovir. We are creating drugs that are active through at least two different routes lessening the potential for the microorganism to mutate to non-susceptible forms and increasing the chances that the microorganism is effectively inhibited.",

All infrared assignments are given in terms of cm\u22121 and are consistent with literature assignments [4, 7, 14]. Results for the product between dimethyltin dichloride and acyclovir will be described. Bands at about 3100 are assigned as arising from C\u2013H aromatic stretching from the acyclovir. Bands at about 2715 are assigned to the C\u2013H aliphatic stretch from the aliphatic ether arm on the acyclovir. Bands at about 2540 are assigned to C\u2013H stretching of methyl groups on the dimethyltin moiety. The band at about 1700 is assigned as derived from the purine ring in the acyclovir. A band at about 580 is prominent in both the spectra of the product and dimethyltin dichloride and the product and not in acyclovir. It is assigned to the Sn\u2013C asymmetric stretching. The Sn\u2013Cl is found in the range of 315\u2013400 below the range of the instrument used to record the spectra. In acyclovir there is a much broader band(s) from 3500 to 3170 that includes both the N\u2013H and O\u2013H stretching vibrations. Much of the 3500 to 3170 band(s) is missing consistent with the absence of the \u2013OH grouping. There is a band about 3445 that is assigned to the N\u2013H stretch.",

In the present study we ground the sample compound with the matrix liquid giving a finely dispersed mixture. The mixture was introduced to the instrument and MS obtained in the usual fashion.

In evaluating the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth, 104 cells are employed for evaluation while for antiviral activity one hundred times this amount, or 106 is employed. The same sized wells are employed such that 106 cells form a continuous cell monolayer across the bottom of the plate. The wells containing 104 cells have space between cells allowing for ready replication. The conditions are such that within the plates containing 106 cells replication occurs no more than once during the test period. For the plates containing 104 cells, the lower concentration encourages rapid growth, generally about seven generations, over the test period. Thus, the cells are rapidly growing in the tests employing the lesser numbers employed for cancer studies in comparison to the much slower growing cells for the viral tests. Furthermore, the amount of drug administered is the same for wells containing 106 cells as for wells containing 104 cells so that the amount of drug per cell within the 106 cell tests is dramatically less than that available for the 104 plates. Thus, concentration effects are largely responsible for most of the observed differences.

Several observations are gleaned from the data. First in all cases, many of the polymers out performed acyclovir itself. The performance is even greater when compared with the amount of acyclovir present in each sample. In general, the amount of acyclovir within the polymers represents about one half of the weight of the polymer so that all of the polymers out performed acyclovir on a total possible amount of acyclovir moiety present. Second, the order of inhibition, based on the concentration needed to effect 50% inhibition is HSV-1 > VZV > Vaccinia WR > Reovirus ST3 with little inhibition found for the reovirus but outstanding inhibition found for HSV-1 and VZV viruses. Third, the order of viral growth inhibition is similar for each of the viruses and also similar with the GI values found for the associated cancer cell lines. For HSV-1 the order is dibutyltin > diethyltin > diphenyltin = dioctyltin > acyclovir > dicyclohexyltin and for VZV the trend is diethyltin > dibutyltin > dioctyltin > diphenyl > dicyclohexyltin > acyclovir.

In addition, a series of mono-, di-, and tri-organotin halides (alkyl and phenyl) exhibited weak antiherpes activity in the same assay system. In a related study [26], this group looked at the same compounds and their activity against both DNA (herpes virus types 1 and 2), a TK (thymidine kinase deficient) strain of HSV type 1, and vaccinia virus. The RNA viruses were vesicular stomatitis virus, coxsackie virus type B4, sindbis virus type 3, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, the complexes exhibited weak antiviral activity and low selectivity. Most of the complexes were active against one or more of the three strains of HSVs. By comparison, only three complexes were active against any of the RNA viruses. None of the compounds were active against vesicular stomatitis or parainfluenza virus or HIV virus.",
