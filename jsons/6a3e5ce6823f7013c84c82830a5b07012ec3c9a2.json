[1] [2] [3] This COVID-19 majorly affects lungs, which cause pneumonia and further damages kidney, heart, liver, etc., due to failure in the defensive mechanism (less immunity). COVID-19 is a family of coronaviruses (CoVs) that are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. CoVs are enveloped viruses containing single standard positive-sense RNA that belongs to Coronaviridae family of the ortho Coronaviridae subfamily which can cause illness in birds, mammals, and humans. [4] COVID-19 is a seventh one in the family of coronavirus. In earlier, six coronaviruses are there, of six, two has considered as an infectious disease in human, which majorly attack the respiratory system, they are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). [5] The current new novel coronavirus COVID-19 also has the same effect, but this epidemic disease spreads faster than SARS and MERS. [5] Hence, the study has been designed to perceive the current effect of COVID-19 on the global population and its fatality with online database of COVID-19. The study also focused on effect of other disease drugs effect on COVID-19.",

Another mechanism of antiviral drugs is related to the post-translational modifications of newly synthesized proteins through glycosylation inhibition. [14] Recently, clinical trial has been done on patients with COVID-19 treatment. About 100% of COVID-19 patients are recovered with hydroxychloroquine treatment in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin compared to 57.1% with hydroxychloroquine treatment alone and 12.5% patients in control (only symptomatic treatment). [2, 15, 16] However, at present, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are tested in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Besides this, chloroquine was considered as preventive medicine for COVID-19. [5] Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of EBOV RNA-polymerase RNA-dependent. In the earlier report of remdesivir treatment, on Ebola virus had shown a 33% fatality rate in early infected stages. [17] However, remdesivir is effective against the COVID-19 in Vero E6 cells, the recommended mechanism for remdesivir involves the host cells post-entry stage. [18] The lopinavir-ritonavir is a combination drug for HIV treatment. Both drugs are HIV protease inhibitors, but ritonavir is also a cytochrome P450 and GP inhibitor. However, lopinavir-ritonavir combination treatment was not associated with the improvement of the patient with COVID-19 compared to standard care procedure. [19] According to the WHO, more than 20 medicines are used to treat COVID-19 patients with 24 clinical trials. However, treatment with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin had shown excellent improvement in patients with COVID-19. To confirm the results, we required more comprehensive studies with a large number of patients. [5] Using the present online database, we have observed that how fast this epidemic disease spreads and kills the global population. Many countries are majorly affected due to this viral infection and where it is going to end is a question for us. However, we are unable to control the spreading of epidemic disease due to lack of full awareness and knowledge. Hence, we require more research activities to acquire knowledge on COVID-19 to break this chain transmission.",
