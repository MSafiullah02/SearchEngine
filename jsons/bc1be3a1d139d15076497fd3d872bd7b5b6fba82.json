They participate in numerous cell -cell recognition events and can also mediate the binding to vertebrate cells of certain toxins and viruses ( 1, 2 ) . A relatively common postsynthetic modifi cation of sialic acid is O -acetylation at the C-9 position. Acetylation of sialic acid also frequently occurs at the C-7 position, from where the acetyl group can spontaneously migrate to the 9-OH position under physiological conditions. The hemagglutinin esterases of infl uenza C viruses and certain nidoviruses, including group 2 coronaviruses, recognize 9 -O-acetylated sialic acidcontaining glycoconjugates on the surface of host cells, and some can remove the 9-O -acetyl moieties ( 3, 4 ) . However, the in vivo biological function of this acetylation event has remained a mystery. One attempt to elucidate the biological role of sialic acid 9-O -acetylation involved the transgenic expression of Infl uenza C hemagglutinin esterase in mice ( 5 ) . This led to a defect in early embryogenesis, indirectly suggesting that 9-O -acetyl sialic acid may be essential dur-ing murine development. In vitro studies ( 6 ) suggested that 9-O -acetylation of \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid containing glycoconjugates impairs the recognition of this glycan moiety by certain Siglecs (sialic acid binding Ig superfamily lectins) including CD22. However, despite these and other tantalizing clues, the intrinsic in vivo functions of this abundant modifi cation have not been established.",

            "text": "Antigen receptor cross-linking leads to the activation of Lyn and other less abundant Src-family kinases that phosphorylate ITIM tyrosines in CD22. Initiation of inhibitory signaling by CD22 is not well understood and the exact mechanism remains controversial. The simplest model that may be indirectly inferred from the phenotypes of KO mice ( 13 -20 ) suggests that antigen receptor ligation contributes to the sialic acid -dependent recruitment of CD22 to the BCR and the subsequent phosphorylation by Lyn of CD22 ITIM tyrosines, which is followed by the recruitment and activation of SHP-1. Other mechanisms of signal initiation have been suggested by several studies variously implicating sialic acid -dependent homooligomerization and sialic acid -independent association of this Siglec with the B cell receptor (BCR) ( 21 -24 ) . Because CD22 is expressed constitutively on mature B cells and \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid -containing N -glycans are abundantly present on the cell surface, it could be argued that CD22 inhibition may itself be constitutive. How inhibitory signaling via CD22 is temporally regulated in mature B cells is unclear. Because CD22 does not bind to 9-O -acetylated sialic acid in vitro ( 6 ) , we considered the possibility that the function of this Siglec might be regulated in vivo by the enzymatic acetylation and deacetylation of \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid. Sialic acid acetyl esterase (Siae), which is molecularly characterized as an enzyme that removes acetyl groups from the 9-OH position of \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid ( 25 ) , was also independently identifi ed as a gene that is up-regulated during B cell maturation ( 26 ) , suggesting a role in the biology of B lymphocytes. In this paper, we show that Siae infl uences B cell signaling and B cell development and participates in inhibitory signaling mechanisms that are crucial to the maintenance of immunological tolerance in the B lineage.",

            "text": "The Siae gene ( sialate:O-acetyl esterase ) can generate two alternatively spliced variants. One form contains a signal peptide and can encode a protein that enters the secretory pathway (originally called Lse [lysosomal sialic acid acetylesterase]), whereas the other lacks this signal peptide and encodes a cytosolic esterase ( 25 -27 ) . Although the Lse protein was thought to localize to lysosomes, a site that would not be suitable for the modifi cation of Siglec ligands, we have observed in transfected cells that this protein exhibits, at best, a limited lysosomal localization and is secreted and can bind to the surface of transfected cells (Figs. S1 and S2, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1). The enzyme, therefore, has the potential to remove acetyl groups from 9-O -acetylated Siglec ligands in a post Golgi vesicle or at the cell surface. Although some antibodies against Siae have been generated, they lack the specifi city to detect Siae in murine cells and tissue sections. The actual location of the Siae protein in murine B cells is therefore yet to be conclusively established. A WT C-terminal FLAG-tagged murine Siae expression construct of the Lse form and an exon 2 -deleted version of this complementary DNA were transfected into COS7 cells. Cell culture medium was recovered and the recombinant protein purifi ed by an antibody column directed to the FLAG epitope. Western blotting analysis on eluate fractions showed that both proteins were expressed, bound, and eluted from the column. Column eluate fractions were subjected to an assay for sialic acid 9-O -acetylesterase activity (left) and acetyl-CoA esterase activity (right) as previously described ( 25 ) . Y axes show cpm. (B) Targeting strategy for the deletion of exon 2 of murine Siae. The top shows the targeting construct used to specifi cally target exon 2 of Siae . The middle shows the expected structure of the locus after targeting. The bottom left shows Southern Blotting of embryonic stem (ES) cells at each step of manipulation detected by a loxP-specifi c probe. The black line indicates that intervening lanes have been spliced out. The bottom right shows Southern blotting of mouse tail DNA after mating heterozygous mice that also expressed the ZP3-Cre Transgene. The expected deleted fragment is 6.5 kb and the expected WT fragment is 4.2 kb. uptake studies uncovered a delayed stimulus strength -dependent inhibition of proliferation (Fig. S8 ) that might be related to a modest increase in ongoing spontaneous apoptosis of follicular B cells in mutant mice (Fig. S9 ). Four diff erent CD22null mutant mice have been described by diff erent groups ( 13 -16 ) , and although enhanced antigen receptor signaling was observed in all four mutants, BCR-induced proliferation was enhanced in some mutants and diminished in others. Enhanced cell death has also been reported in some CD22 mutants ( 14, 16 ) .",

This reagent, designated CHE-FcD, binds to N -linked glycans that are decorated with 9-O -acetylated \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid moieties.

Thymidine are consistent with the ability of Siae to negatively regulate BCR signaling. Follicular B cells occupy two niches: the follicular niche in conventional secondary lymphoid organs and the perisinusoidal niche in the BM ( 32, 33 ) . In mutant mice, including Aiolos \u03ea / \u03ea mice, CD22 \u03ea / \u03ea mice, and CD72 \u03ea / \u03ea mice, all of which exhibit enhanced BCR signal strength, there is some reduction in follicle size was also apparent. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that IgM hi IgD hi CD21 hi MZ B cell precursors (MZP), as well as IgM hi IgD lo CD21 hi MZ B cells, were markedly reduced in Siae \u232c 2/ \u232c 2 mice ( Fig. 5 B ). An analysis of the absolute numbers of B cells in Siae \u232c 2/ \u232c 2 mice ( Table I ) revealed a striking decrease in MZP and MZ B cells and a more modest reduction in follicular B cells. These results sion and an increase in 9-O -acetylation of Neu5Ac ( 43 ) . Cmah -null mice as well as Cmah/Siae double mutant mice would therefore be expected to exhibit BCR hyperreactivity, the relative loss of MZ B cells, and a relative loss of perisinusoidal B cells. Indeed, B cells from Cmah mutant mice have been reported to exhibit an enhanced proliferative response to BCR cross-linking ( 44 ) . We show here that B cells from Cmah -null mice have higher levels of 9-Oacetyated sialic acid as revealed by CHE-FcD binding (Fig. S10, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem .20081399/DC1). Both Cmah -null mice and Cmah/Siae double mutant mice present with enhanced BCR activation as measured by the release of intracellular calcium after antigen receptor ligation and, as predicted, present with marked reductions in MZ B cells and perisinusoidal B cells (Figs. S10 and S11). A combination of two changes in the structure of sialic acid that each compromise CD22 binding results in a phenotype that is similar to that seen in mice with enhanced 9-O -acetylation of sialic acid alone but is quite distinct from the phenotype of mice with the complete loss of \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid.",

Siae \u232c 2/ \u232c 2 lymphocytes in reconstituted mice exhibited a defect in MZ B cell development and a reduction of perisinusoidal BM B cells ( Fig. 5 E ) , which establishes that these developmental abnormalities represent lymphocyte-intrinsic defects. No gross defect in T cell development was discovered in the absence of Siae ( Fig. 5 F ) , although there was a small decrease in T cell numbers both in the thymus and the spleen ( Tables III and IV ) . Other B cell -defi cient mice have been reported to have a mild decrease in T cell numbers ( 36 ) . The phenotype of Siae mutant mice in which a subtle alteration may have been generated in CD22 ligands is very diff erent from that of the ST6GalI -null mouse, which completely lacks \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid and which presents with defects in B cell activation and in thymocyte development ( 37, 38 ) . Murine CD22, unlike human CD22, has a markedly higher affi nity for Neu5Gc (sialic acid with an N -glycolyl moiety in the C5 position; the major form in the mouse) as compared with Neu5Ac (sialic acid with an N -acetyl moiety in the C5 position) ( 39 -42 ) . The enzyme CMP-Neu-5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) converts CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc, and mice lacking this enzyme not only synthesize N -glycans with a subtly diff erent form of sialic acid that binds CD22 poorly but they also exhibit a poorly understood down-regulation of Siae expres- dal B cells, alterations in B cell proliferation that are dependent on the degree and duration of BCR cross-linking, some increase in follicular B cell apoptosis, and the spontaneous development of antinuclear antibodies.",

Although these results imply that ligation of CD22 by \u2423 2 -6 sialic acid -containing ligands contributes to inhibitory signaling, the precise role that sialoglyconjugates play in the function of CD22 remains to be determined with certainty. The phenotypes of CD22 KO mice clearly suggest that a major in vivo function of this Siglec is to attenuate BCR signaling, but other studies have suggested that CD22 may potentially contribute to both inhibitory and activating functions ( 47 ) . Mutating or blocking the sialic acid binding site of CD22 in a cell line context led to a loss of CD22 It has been suggested that CD22 may function as an enforcer of peripheral tolerance ( 45 ) , and a possible role for CD22 in setting signaling thresholds in the context of tolerance has been previously postulated ( 46 ) . Lyn-null mice ( 17 -19 ) , as well as conditional SHP-1 mice ( 21 ), develop a lupuslike phenotype, supporting the notion that CD22, possibly other Siglecs, SHP-1, and Lyn are part of an inhibitory axis setting higher thresholds for B cell activation by self-antigens as well as by exogenous antigens ( 46 ) . Siae may be an important component of this inhibitory axis ( Fig. 7 ) .",

Knockin mice harboring an identical mutation in the sialic acid binding site of CD22 exhibited some, but not all, of the phenotypic changes seen in CD22 null mice. Strikingly, an enhanced calcium fl ux was not observed in this knockin mouse after BCR ligation ( 22 ) . Background-dependent modifi er genes do contribute to differences seen in CD22-dependent phenotypes in KO and knockin animals, and there is growing evidence from SNP genotyping that even inbred mice strains are heterogenous at several loci ( 49 ) . Nevertheless, no satisfactory explanation can be provided at present for the discrepant results of site directed mutagenesis-based studies of CD22 function. ST6GalI is the sialyl transferase that transfers sialic acid in an \u2423 2 -6-linked form from CMP-Sia to the preterminal galactose on N -glycans in the Golgi. In mice lacking ST6GalI, the absence of ligands for CD22 might have been expected to result in enhanced BCR signaling. Instead, these mice exhibit a gross defect in B cell signaling after ligation of the BCR and of other mitogenic receptors in B cells ( 37 ) . One interpretation provided for these data is that in the absence of \u2423 2 -6linked sialic acid in the ST6GalI -null mouse, CD22 fails to multimerize and cannot be sequestered from the BCR ( 50 ). It is possible that in the absence of ST6GalI, inhibition of the BCR by CD22 is enhanced because of an abnormal facilitation of CD22 and IgM colocalization ( 23 ) . However, the basis for this enhanced colocalization is not known, the reason for the relatively broad defect in signaling in ST6GalI mutant mice is not entirely clear, and is it not fully understood why these mice have defects in thymocyte development ( 38 ) .",

Although these data have been interpreted to indicate a restoration in the absence of CD22 of BCR signaling that was diminished in the absence of ST6Gal I, both studies on cd22 \u03ea / \u03ea /ST6GalI \u03ea / \u03ea mice do not actually show a restoration of BCR signaling to WT levels but demonstrate that BCR signaling is enhanced in double mutant mice to levels similar to those seen in cd22 \u03ea / \u03ea B cells. The loss of CD22 may be considered to be dominant. These data are therefore compatible with the possibility that CD22 can provide inhibitory signals constitutively, presumably by providing ITIM tyrosines as a potential substrate for phosphorylation by Lyn and other Src family kinases. Nevertheless, CD22 might provide optimal inhibitory signals only in the presence of its sialoglycoconjugate ligands. The total absence of \u2423 2 -6-linked sialic acid may represent a relatively drastic alteration that could result in aberrant capping of N -acetyllactosamine termini of many glycans ( 52 ) and might aff ect B cell function adversely in poorly understood ways. A subtle alteration of the structure of CD22 ligands, such as enhanced 9-O -acetylation of sialic acid in mice with mutant Siae , or the combined loss of Neu5Gc and enhanced 9-O -acetylation of sialic acid in the Cmah -null mouse and the Cmah-Siae double mutant mouse both appear to provide somewhat diff erent insights compared with those obtained from the ST6Gal1 KO mouse harboring a more global alteration in CD22 ligand structure.",

Collectively, the spontaneous secretion of increased levels of class switched immunoglobulins and antichromatin antibodies, the accumulation of glomerular immune complex deposits, and the apparent activation-dependent attrition of follicular B cells in Siae mutant mice suggest a stronger phenotype in these mice than that observed in mice lacking CD22. These data suggest indirectly that Siae might not only attenuate CD22 function but may also possibly regulate an additional Siglec or Siglecs in B cells, although direct evidence for such a hypothesis is lacking. A second inhibitory Siglec in murine B cells, Siglec G, has been previously described ( 53 ) . However, although Siglec G -defi cient mice exhibit a marked increase in B-1a B cells, IgG autoantibodies are not increased.

Red cells were lysed with 2 ml ACK lysing buff er (Cambrex). The lysis buff er was neutralized by adding 10 ml PBS and 0.2% BSA (PBA). Before staining, 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells were reacted with 2.5 \u03bc g of 2.4G2 (anti-CD16/CD32 [Fc \u2425 III/II receptor], rat IgG 2b , ; BD). Surface staining was performed using appropriate dilutions of antibodies in 12 \u00d7 75-mm round-bottom polystyrene tubes in a volume of 200 \u03bc l for 30 min in the dark at 4 \u00b0 C.",

Unstained cells were used to set voltage and single color positive controls were used for electronic compensation. Viable cells were determined by forward and side scatter characteristics and 3 -5 \u00d7 10 4 gated events were collected. Gates were set as previously described ( 33 ) . Processed samples were BCR signaling noted in mice that lack CD22 and in Siae mutant mice suggests that loss of tolerance may result from a mechanism that is distinct from models invoking clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy, all of which might be presumed to be enhanced, not abrogated, by an increase in BCR signal strength in B cells. These well established mechanisms of tolerance have been studied extensively using transgenic and knockin models that use relatively high-affi nity BCRs for model self-antigens. The analysis of anti -HEL-soluble HEL double transgenic mice in a cd22 -null background did not result in a break in tolerance to HEL ( 46, 54 ) . We expand here on a suggestion originally made by Neuberger and coworkers ( 45 ) and also discussed by Cornall et al. ( 46 ) that CD22, and possibly other Siglecs, might set thresholds for the activation of B cells in the periphery. Weakly self-reactive B cells may not be activated by self-antigens because CD22 helps set an activation threshold in the periphery. If the strength of activation of B cells by self-antigens were to cross a threshold, the processing and presentation of self-antigens could be facilitated, and the unwanted entry of relatively weakly self-reactive B cells into the germinal center reaction might also occur. There are many potential ways in which, during an infection, a self-structure may be physically complexed with a foreign protein. In a viral infection, for instance, host chromatin may contain proteins of viral origin bound to host antigens including host nucleic acids. If the BCR threshold signaling is not set high enough (because of defects in CD22 or Siae for instance), self-antigens might not only activate weakly self-reactive B cells but may also deliver physically linked foreign proteins to endosomes in B cells, thus permitting the receipt of T cell help for somatic mutation. It is perhaps signifi cant that in human autoimmune diseases in which antibodies are known to be relevant, pathogenic autoantibodies tend to be somatically mutated and class switched. Siglecs, assisted by Siae, presumably play a key role in keeping weakly self-reactive B cells quiescent. It is clear that analyses of responses to one specifi c T cell -dependent synthetic immunogen are not apparently consonant with the spontaneous immunoglobulin and autoantibody levels observed in Siae mutant mice, and there is a need for more detailed immunization studies in these mutant mice and in controls.",

Although more than one sialic acid O -acetyl transferase may exist ( 55 ) , to date no such O-acetyl transferase has been molecularly identifi ed. Our data indicate that modulation of 9-O -acetylation of sialic acid, a modifi cation which was fi rst described more than half a century ago ( 1 ), regulates inhibitory signaling in B lymphocytes and participates in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Furthermore, our ongoing unpublished studies involving deep resequencing of the SIAE gene in human controls, and patients with autoimmunity have revealed a strong 1% NP40 in PBS. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-CD22 (CD-22 rabbit IgG; Epitomics, Inc.) and protein A Sepharose, and after separation on an SDS/polyacrylamide gel and Western transfer, membranes were probed with antibodies to CD22, SHP-1, and phosphotyrosine (anti-CD22.2, clone Lyb-8.2 [BD]; anti-SHP1/2 rabbit polyclonal IgG, and antiphosphotyrosine, clone 4G10 [Millipore]).
