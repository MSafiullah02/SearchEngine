            "text": "The product of a protein-coding gene that is delivered to the cytoplasm is an export competent mRNA\u2013protein (mRNP) complex [1]. An mRNP contains a processed mRNA and a large number of associated proteins [2, 3]. The formation of an mRNP requires multiple and coordinated processes. The active gene is a crucial nuclear subdomain where synthesis, processing, and assembly of pre-mRNPs and mRNPs take place [4]. Chromatin structure, RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) transcription elongation rate, and the integrated action of a number of processing machineries will all have an impact on the formation of the pre-mRNPs and mRNPs. Pre-mRNAs exist, very rarely, if ever, as complete copies of the gene, because the processing machineries that execute capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 cleavage and polyadenylation also operate at the transcribing gene. Transcription by the RNA pol II elongation complex results in a pre-mRNA. During ongoing transcription, various proteins associate rapidly with the newly synthesized pre-mRNA. Furthermore, as a consequence of processing, defined proteins will be deposited onto the pre-mRNA at specific positions [5\u20138]. Proteins bind to pre-mRNAs in a highly ordered assembly process. The resulting pre-mRNPs change their structure as additional RNA is added, as additional proteins associate and as processing modifies the RNA. The associated proteins are important for every aspect of the fate of an mRNP, including export, localization in the cytoplasm, engagement with the translation machinery, quality control, stability, and degradation.",

Some processing and protein acquisition can occur in the interchromatin, but to what extent an mRNP is modified, as to composition and structure remain to be determined. Apparently, mRNPs spend some time in the interchromatin. Varying sizes of pools of gene-specific mRNPs, therefore, exist. Unproductive encounters between the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and individual mRNPs can occur [10\u201312], either because the mRNPs do not have the necessary components, in this sense, are not export competent, or because the docking process at the NPC simply fails. When export competent mRNPs successfully dock at the NPCs, they are subsequently translocated through the NPC channel and thereafter released into the cytoplasm. During translocation, both conformational and compositional changes take place within the mRNPs.",

It is clear that there is a close physical and functional coupling between transcription, processing, and assembly of pre-mRNPs and mRNPs. The mRNP obtains a processed structure and a collection of proteins that will influence the downstream events. The intricate physical and functional couplings are likely to have evolved, because they enhance coordination, efficiency, and regulation of the multiple steps of gene expression (Fig. 1). We will provide a cell biological view, focusing on the spatial and temporal aspects of formation and export of mRNPs, a perspective that is required for a full understanding of the intranuclear steps of gene expression. This cell biological view is largely based on studies of specialized, polytene cells that allow morphological, spatial, and temporal insights into the nuclear processes [13].",

Compartmentalization creates microenvironments that are believed to facilitate coordination, efficiency, and regulation. The molecular mechanisms for establishing nuclear compartments are not well understood, but it has been suggested that they can be formed by either random self-organization or by an ordered assembly pathway. In addition, a so-called seeding mechanism could contribute [15, 16]. Several compartments form at sites of transcription, in a transcription-dependent manner, suggesting a role for RNA. The RNA can then nucleate the formation of the compartment. Both coding and non-coding transcripts are capable of attracting and retaining freely diffusible components from the nucleoplasmic pool [16, 17]. In vitro, interactions between RNAs and proteins can result in reversible membrane-free structures [18]. If such structures, so-called droplets or hydrogels, reflect the in vivo situation, special physical and biochemical properties could possibly favour different biological processes. RNA\u2013protein assemblies may associate with components that play important roles in gene expression [19] or influence aggregates involved in diseases [20].",

Upon gene activation, the chromatin is extensively modified and unfolded, forming loops. Such loops can be readily visualized in specialized cells, such as amphibian oocytes [21] and polytene cells [13, 22]. Electron microscopy (EM) has revealed unfolded active genes also in mammalian diploid cell nuclei in perichromatin regions [23]. In situ hybridization experiments have also demonstrated unfolding of active genes [24]. Transcription activation can lead to transient physical proximity of the genes [25]. It has been suggested that transcription occurs in statically assembled structures, so-called transcription factories [26]. However, clustering of RNA pol II upon gene activation has been demonstrated to be transient [27]. In the polytene Balbiani ring (BR) gene loci, efficient recruitment of RNA pol II and proteins needed for pre-mRNP assembly and processing takes place upon transcription activation and apparently at the level of the individual gene locus. The presence of many active gene copies in the polytene chromosome results in a high local concentration of transcription and processing machineries that could be beneficial.",

            "text": "It is still not clear how recruitment of factors to active genes is brought about, although several mechanisms have been proposed (Fig. 2). Many proteins and preformed complexes, for example SR proteins and snRNPs, have affinity for the nascent transcript. The binding is sometimes mediated by specific sequences in the RNA [29\u201331]. Other proteins and complexes bind not directly to the transcript, but in layers of interactions to already bound components [32, 33]. While it is clear that protein modifications influence binding affinities, for example the phosphorylation status of SR proteins [34], it remains to understand to what extent diffusion and regulated affinities contribute. Other mechanisms could be important, such as preformation of sub complexes [35] and local recycling. The latter has been suggested for RNA pol II through coordination between transcription and 3\u2032 end processing [36, 37]. Another way of coordinating interactions between the transcript and specific proteins is via the RNA pol II elongation complex. As the 5\u2032 end of the RNA emerges from the exit tunnel, the capping enzyme, bound to the RNA pol II, is in position to rapidly cap the 5\u2032 end [38]. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA pol II is implicated as a flexible interaction platform that helps to recruit different factors [39]. The CTD consists of many heptapeptide repeats that are phosphorylated differently during initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription. It has been shown that the RNA guanyltransferase binds to the CTD during transcription initiation [40, 41]. Several 3\u2032 processing factors bind to the CTD [42\u201344], as well as the Transcription-Export (TREX) sub complex THO [45]. It is less clear to what extent spliceosomal components reach the nascent transcript via the CTD. The splicing factors U2AF65 [46] and PSF and its related protein p54nrb/NonO [47, 48] have been shown to bind to the CTD. Presumably, the role of the CTD modifications for recruitment of processing components will be even more appreciated. Methods to couple phospho-specific CTD modifications to interactions with defined proteins using specific antibodies combined with mass spectrometry is a promising start [49].",

One such consideration is the influence of chromatin on the transcription rate and pre-mRNA splicing [55]. The transcription rate can be uniform along exons and introns in long human genes [56], but it is also established that transcription rates can change along a gene [57, 58] and that this influences splice site choices [59]. The presence of alternative binding sites in the nascent transcript can lead to competition for binding of the interacting machineries. To what extent a high transcription rate results in the presence of alternative binding sites is likely to depend on the exon\u2013intron structure, the binding affinities, and the kinetics of processing reactions. Therefore, a simple relationship does not exist between transcription rate and for example alternative splice site choices [60].",

Some of these may work through affecting the RNA pol II transcription rate and others by influencing the recruitment of splicing factors. One example is the H3K36 methylation that plays a role in nucleosome positioning and in limiting elongation rate and thereby influencing splicing [72]. H3K36 methylation can also indirectly recruit the splicing regulators PTB and SRSF1 to the gene via so-called histone mark readers [73, 74]. In addition, the recruitment of spliceosomal components can be controlled by histone modifications [75]. In addition to methylation, other modifications of histones have been described, for example phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. It remains to be determined if also these modifications have an impact on splicing. An emerging field is the role of small and long non-coding RNAs in local alterations of chromatin modifications that will influence the splicing pattern [76].",

The folding of an RNA is functionally important and it can influence interactions with trans-acting factors and itself be influenced by such interactions. Folding can have an impact on transcription [81] and the transcription rate can have an effect on RNA folding [82]. In addition, the folding of the pre-mRNA is dynamic, for example dictated by interactions with spliceosomes and not surprisingly, and the local structure in the pre-mRNA can affect splicing [83, 84]. Throughout the life of a pre-mRNA and an mRNA, the RNA exists in the context of an RNA\u2013protein complex and this complex is repeatedly remodelled. Association of the pre-mRNA and mRNA with proteins has a profound effect on the folding of the RNA\u2013protein complex.",

            "text": "The repertoire of proteins that associate with RNA is substantial and diverse [85]. Large-scale methods have broaden the identification of RNA\u2013protein interactions, but in many cases, the functional importance of the interactions remains to be determined [29]. In general, RNA-binding proteins associate with RNAs using specific domains [30]. Several such domains have been characterized, for example the RBD (also called RRM) and the KH (hnRNP K-homology) domains. Many proteins with regulatory functions in gene expression contain multiple KH domains [86]. Other proteins involved in processes in gene expression contain one or more copies of RBDs. In fact, about 2% of the mammalian proteins contain this domain [87]. Examples include SR proteins [88], hnRNP proteins [89], poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [90], and the 3\u2032-processing protein CstF-64 [91]. RBDs have a typical structure and recognize crucial nucleotides in short degenerate sequence motifs. Sequence specificity and the binding domain sequence are often conserved [92]. In vitro, the binding affinity for individual tested domains is usually low, but in the cell, affinity might be higher, because other regions of the protein or even coupling to other proteins assist. In a given protein, an RBD can be combined with other kinds of domains that perform other types of functions, for example helicase activity or mediating protein\u2013protein contacts. Proteins can recognize common mRNA structural elements, for example the m7G cap [93], the poly(A) tail [8], and the sugar-phosphate backbone [32]. Some proteins recognize specific sequence motifs, for example the poly(A) signal, and others associate in a sequence-independent manner with either secondary or tertiary folds [31]. They can be stably bound, for example as architectural elements that help to define mRNP organization, or transiently bound, for example involved in modulating specific steps of gene expression. Proteins can also bind indirectly to the pre-mRNA and mRNA via other factors, as in the exon junction complex (EJC) [32]. It should be pointed out that pre-mRNA processing machineries operate in the context of RNA\u2013protein complexes and many proteins bind to the pre-mRNPs and mRNPs as a consequence of pre-mRNA processing, and examples include the cap-binding complex (CBC), the EJC, and PABPN1.",

The hnRNPs are preferentially present in cell nuclei. This reflects that they can leave the mRNP before export or that they rapidly shuttle back from the cytoplasm to the nucleus or a combination of the two. Some hnRNPs can accompany the mRNP to the cytoplasm and into polysomes. When bound to pre-mRNPs, they can affect packaging and stability. It has been suggested that hnRNP C tetramers organize the pre-mRNA [96]. The hnRNPs influence the transcripts in many different ways, for example as part of the pre-mRNPs, they can influence processing [97] and in the cytoplasm, they play roles in mRNP translation and stability [95].",

The packaging of the endogenous BR1 and BR2 pre-mRNPs has been described using EM [22]. These approximately 40 kb-long pre-mRNAs, consisting mainly of exon sequences, are initially packaged into thin, 5\u201310 nm pre-mRNP fibers. Remodelling takes place, resulting in an approximately 20 nm thick, flexible RNP in which a thin 7 nm fibre probably is a basic structural element. The 20 nm fibre grows at its root until obtaining a length of 90 nm. At this stage, about 8 kb of the transcript is incorporated. Then, a conformational change at the tip of the 20 nm fibre results in a ribbon with a diameter of 26 nm, and subsequently, this ribbon compacts into a ring-like RNP with a final diameter of 50 nm. In contrast, in the BR3 gene, the pre-mRNA contains alternating short exons and introns throughout its length. The BR3 gene is 10.5 kb long, but because of the structurally dynamic splicing process, a full-length pre-mRNA is not present. The BR3 pre-mRNP structure is then dominated by the assembly, action, and release of spliceosomes [51]. Evidently, the exon\u2013intron organization greatly influences the packaging of the pre-mRNPs. So far, a completely processed BR3 mRNP has not been possible to identify, and therefore, no structural information is available.",

            "text": "Intron excision requires the multicomponent spliceosome [109]. Spliceosome assembly takes place during ongoing transcription [110, 111], evidently for a majority of pre-mRNAs [112\u2013116]. Close proximity between the spliceosome, the RNA pol II, and the chromatin has been demonstrated [51]. Many studies have reported interactions between individual components of transcription and processing machineries. In most cases, these interactions, and especially their functional significance, are difficult to evaluate. We need improved methods to characterize and functionally evaluate protein\u2013RNA and protein\u2013protein interactions at active genes in living cells. In vivo rates for the splicing process have been reported to range from 30 s to several minutes [117\u2013119]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the spliceosome can assemble on the pre-mRNA already when the RNA pol II has synthesized in the order of 24 nucleotides downstream a 3\u2032 splice site [120]. Efficient RNAseq methods combined with robust extraction of nascent transcripts are required for analysis of additional endogenous genes to learn the rules. Understanding the principles for constitutive splicing will be important for understanding regulation of splicing. Measurements of the precise kinetics of alternative splicing will be important to verify the molecular mechanisms involved. It will also be important to learn if and to what extent the rate of splicing can be modified. Introns are excised in an overall 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order [117, 121], but all introns are not necessarily excised at the gene. In a population of gene-specific pre-mRNAs, some of the transcripts lose their introns in the interchromatin [111, 121]. This may be due to variation in splicing kinetics, the length of the gene [56, 111], and alternative splicing regulation. A nascent pre-mRNP can contain more than one intron, showing that spliceosome assembly and activity do not stall the RNA pol II until an intron is excised [51].",

The EJC core contains four proteins, eIF4AIII, the heterodimer Mago-Y14 and Barentsz. All four core proteins associate with the nascent pre-mRNA [130]. Mapping of binding sites shows that the full set of EJC core proteins, including Barentsz, are present at most exon\u2013exon junctions, but additional binding sites exist for eIF4AIII [102, 131, 132].

Interactions between the TREX components ALY/REF and THOC5 with several proteins of the 3\u2032 processing machinery indicate that TREX is important for 3\u2032 processing and possibly for release of the transcript from the gene. The cleavage reaction takes place at the gene. In the BR1 gene, microdissection revealed that a population of correctly spliced and cleaved mRNPs was present at the gene. This population had a short poly(A) tail, 10\u201320 adenylate residues long [136]. In the interchromatin, a switch from a distributive to a processive elongation mode of polyadenylation then took place, adding on average 100 adenylate residues. The presence of a population of mRNPs with short poly(A) tails at the gene could be due to retention of the mRNP during the initial polyadenylation reaction, possibly involving the 3\u2032 processing machinery. Moreover, it could reflect the initial distributive phase of polyadenylation observed in vitro. The length of the poly(A) tail is controlled by PABPN1 [8]. Other proteins are also involved, for example the mammalian protein Nucleophosmin 1 that is deposited onto the mRNA upstream the poly(A) signal [137]. Release of mRNPs from the gene requires splicing, cleavage at a correct polyadenylation signal, and polyadenylation [138]. The mechanism for mRNP release from the gene and the potential relationship to termination of transcription is still unclear.",

An obvious answer is that each mRNP requires export adaptors and export receptors. Evolution has resulted in multiple different export adaptors and their recruitment to mRNPs is promoted by transcription and processing.

TREX can be recruited to the 5\u2032 UTR of the pre-mRNA, dependent on the CBP80 protein [108] and on splicing [161]. The TREX subunit ALY/REF interacts with the EJC component eIF4AIII [162], making it likely that the EJC is involved in loading TREX onto the pre-mRNA. In yeast, ALY/REF can also interact with Pcf1, a 3\u2032 cleavage factor [163]. UAP56 is involved in recruiting ALY/REF [164] and other proteins that influence export adaptor function. The mammalian DDX39 protein is a UAP56 paralog and has overlapping functions. UAP56 has also been shown to interact with UIF, which can bind to NXF1 and thus serve as an export adaptor [165].",

In addition, studies in yeast have shown that subunits of TREX-2 interact with the SAGA histone acetylase complex and the promoter-bound Mediator complex [170, 171] and could thereby provide a functional link, and possibly physical coupling, between transcription initiation and mRNP export through the NPC. The TREX-2 subunit GANP can interact directly with NXF1, but it is unclear whether it is a general export factor. It has been shown that GANP is involved in the selective export of specific mRNAs, including those coding for components involved in mRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis [172]. The GANP-dependent export pathway may thereby facilitate rapid changes in gene expression.",

Fractionation of cell nuclei, followed by quantification of the catalytically active SF3b155 protein, estimated that about 20% of splicing takes place in the nucleoplasmic fraction [112]. Several other examples of post-transcriptional removal of introns have been reported [83, 176\u2013178]. The time remaining from the synthesis of an intron until transcription termination and 3\u2032 processing influences if intron excision is completed co- or post-transcriptionally [56, 111, 121]. In a population of gene-specific pre-mRNAs, excision of a given intron can take place during transcription in most transcripts and be completed after release from the gene in the remaining transcripts [111]. This suggests that even if spliceosome assembly is initiated during transcription, the splicing reaction does not need to occur at the gene. An interesting question is, if co-transcriptional splicing requires the RNA Pol II and its CTD, how can post-transcriptional splicing do without it? Possibly, the initial steps of spliceosome assembly take place during transcription, while completion of splicing can be performed away from the gene.",

Transcribing genes are often located at the surface of the granule clusters. The proximity between active genes and the granule clusters may well-facilitate spliceosomal recruitment to the nascent transcripts. Active spliceosomes have been detected in speckles [112], suggesting that some introns are excised in this environment. During influenza A viral infection, a balance between synthesis of unspliced M1 mRNA and spliced M2 mRNA is established. The M2 mRNA seems to be generated by splicing within interchromatin granule clusters. It may be a way to ensure efficient supply of spliceosomal components. Interestingly, the viral NS1 protein in combination with a host NS1-binding protein is needed for targeting the M1 mRNAs to the speckles [181].",

The BR pre-mRNPs and the mRNPs released from the gene contain several export adaptors and it is so far unknown why NXF1 is not recruited until the mRNP is present in the interchromatin. Possible explanations include necessary structural adaptor rearrangements in the BR mRNP and requirement of so far unknown factors only present in the interchromatin.

            "text": "For export, mRNPs depend on association with export receptors (Fig. 3). These receptors mediate productive interactions with the NPC. Export receptors need adaptor proteins for binding to mRNPs. The majority of mRNPs uses the receptor NXF1/NXT1 heterodimer for their export [157, 196, 197]. NXF1 has an N-terminal RBD and can bind to RNA weakly, but with increased affinity in the presence of ALY/REF. It has a leucine-rich region that together with the RBD can bind to CTE motifs in viral RNAs [198]. In addition, NXF1 has a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain and a domain similar to that found in NTF2. This domain is important for several protein interactions [199]. The two latter domains can interact with FG-containing NPC proteins. NXF1 binds weakly and unspecific to mRNA, but upon recruitment via the adapter ALY/REF and THOC5, NXF1 is remodelled to expose its RBD, facilitating the binding to RNA [200]. Consistent with NXF1 binding to several export adaptors, at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, as well as within transcripts, it is likely that multiple copies of NXF1 bind to individual mRNPs. Analysis by iCLIP has demonstrated many NXF1-binding sites in close proximity to the SR protein SRSF3 [175]. NXF1 interacts with several different proteins of the NPC during the translocation process. This will be discussed below.",

This observation is in agreement with studies of single mRNPs in diploid cell nuclei where no directionality in mRNP movement has been recorded. Accordingly, inside nuclei, mRNPs move by diffusion [216\u2013219]. The movement is likely to be restricted by the chromatin and mainly taking place through the network of interchromatin channels. It has been calculated that the movement of mRNPs from the active gene to the NPC takes between 6 and 50 min in diploid nuclei [9, 220]. Different diffusion characteristics have been described for different mRNPs. Small mRNPs tend to move faster than large mRNPs [9]. Thus, a nucleus contains pools of mRNPs and the pools are of different sizes for specific mRNPs. For a specific gene, the size of such a pool is likely to be influenced by transcription, processing, and diffusion characteristics. Nuclear pools of processed mRNPs have been described for several genes and suggested to buffer the level of cytoplasmic mRNPs [221].",

Approximately equal numbers of BR mRNPs, about half the size of the interchromatin pool, are synthesized and are exported to the cytoplasm per time unit. Immune-EM analyses show that BR mRNPs associate with the export receptor CRM1 at the gene [226], although CRM1 does not seem to be important for export of BR mRNPs. The BR mRNPs also associate with several NXF1 adaptors, for example SR proteins. However, in the interchromatin pool, only about 25% of the BR mRNPs contain NXF1 at a given moment [130]. It is, therefore, possible that BR mRNPs move around by diffusion in the interchromatin and randomly bind NXF1.",

The 5\u2032 end leads the way [250], while the 3\u2032 end of the BR mRNP remains in contact with the basket ring. Other studies have shown that during translocation, NXF1 interacts sequentially with the FG Nups [251]. The transport of large mRNPs is facilitated if the cargo binds multiple export receptors. The exact mechanism of mRNP translocation is still unclear. Several transport models have been proposed for how export receptors (and import receptors) facilitate transport through the FG-Nup barrier. These include the selective phase, the reduction of dimensionality, and the virtual gating models [252, 253]. Extensive unfolding may be necessary for large mRNPs, such as the BR mRNPs. The reason for unfolding may be coupled to the translocation process or be dictated by space limitations of the NPC. We do not know if a conformational change is obligatory also for smaller mRNPs. Furthermore, the fact that BR mRNPs reach the cytoplasm with its 5\u2032 end first could reflect efficient assembly of polysomes already in the perinuclear compartment, in a secretory cell. It remains to be demonstrated if this polarity of translocation is valid also for mRNPs, in general. If so, it could rather reflect the translocation process.",

Other studies have shown that upon exit from the central channel, mRNPs associate with the cytoplasmic part of the NPC [254]. A recent study has described how the Nups at the cytoplasmic side are oriented inward towards the central channel [242], presumably streamlining the passage of the mRNPs from the FG-repeats in the channel to a cytoplasmic platform. At this platform, the mRNPs are remodelled as a result of the coordinated action of the DEAD-box helicase DDX19 (in yeast Dbp5), Gle1 (in yeast Gle), and its cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), and Nup214 (in yeast Nup159) [255]. Export factors are removed during remodelling, and eventually recycled back to the nucleus [256]. It is likely that many proteins remain bound to the mRNP. In the case of BR mRNPs, it has been demonstrated that, for example, SR, hnRNP, and Y-box proteins are not removed at this stage. The compositional and conformational change of the mRNP promotes directionality and it will prevent the mRNP from traveling back into the NPC. A deeper insight into the molecular changes in mRNP composition and where and when these changes occur in relation to NPCs and the translocation process will require high-resolution studies of endogenous mRNPs.",

            "text": "Export of viral mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has attracted considerable interest. In general, viruses take over cellular export factors, for example, the NXF1 and CRM1 export receptors, using a variety of strategies. Several viruses produce mRNAs that contain elements that can bind TREX [276] or that can directly bind NXF1 [277]. Other viruses, such as influenza and Hepatitis B viruses, produce specific export adaptor proteins. These proteins recruit ALY/REF or DDX39B and TREX and subsequently NXF1 [278, 279]. Other examples of cis-acting elements present in viral mRNAs that can bind export factors are the element in type D retroviruses that directly bind NXF1 [277, 280], and the Rev response element in HIV-1 mRNA that binds multimerized Rev proteins which, in turn, bind CRM1 [281, 282].",

            "text": "A deeper understanding of the processes of gene expression in the intact cell nucleus will have a great impact on many aspects of biology, ranging from evolution to cell differentiation and neurobiology. It will also be essential for diagnosis and treatment in most disciplines of medicine. It is important to continue to identify and characterize processes and the involved individual components, probably with an emphasis on multi-molecular complexes and the dynamic changes of such complexes. The most important and, at the same time, most challenging area is how everything operates in the living cell. Knowledge about the compositional and conformational dynamics of complexes and their interactions must be studied in the perspective of functional importance for endogenous genes in intact cells. This goal is demanding and exciting, and will require that new methods are developed. Such methods should be able to map the interplay within and between RNA\u2013protein and protein\u2013protein complexes, including the temporal and spatial dimensions. As an example, it is already evident that the pre-mRNP, the processing machineries, and the chromatin are all in very close contact. It is desirable to learn which interactions are the functionally important ones. Furthermore, we need to know more about how various components are recruited to sites of action and thereafter recycled, in the intact cell.",
