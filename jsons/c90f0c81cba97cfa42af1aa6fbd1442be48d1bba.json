Most countries are limiting contact between citizens, most notably China, where Wuhan was placed under lockdown within just 23 days of the outbreak, and contact with neighboring cities was forbidden (Lin et al., 2020) . France, Switzerland, and Austria closed their borders on March 17 th , while France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and some states in the US have been implementing strict policies to limit contact between citizens, including nationwide stay-at-home orders, thereby preventing the domestic spread of COVID-19 (Kinross et al. 2020 ). South Korea's total population is 51.8 million, of which a large proportion resides or is active in the capital and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province. Of the total population, 13.28 million (26.0%), 9.73 million (18.7%), and 2.95 million (5.7%) reside in Gyeonggi Province, Seoul, and Incheon, respectively (Resident, 2020) . Several studies indicate that these densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on public transport could increase the potential spread of COVID-19 (Choi and Ki, 2014; Korean Society of Infectious Diseases et al., 2020; BBC News, 2020; Shim et al., 2020) . On March 2 nd , the South Korean government initially postponed the commencement of elementary, middle, and high schools for 4 weeks J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f until April 6 th and of university classes until March 16 th , before switching to online classes until April 16 th . Some schools have decided to conduct online classes for the entire first semester (Koh and Hoenig, 2020) . Due to joint efforts, including public institutions, private enterprises, other companies implementing work-from-home systems to minimize travel, preventive education for citizens via social distancing campaigns, preparation of disinfectant in every building and street, and information transparency regarding the movements and locations of confirmed patients, a decreasing trend is being observed in the daily number of new COVID-19 patients.",

Particularly, unlike in Spain, the US, and the UK, outdoor excursions are not restricted in South Korea. Therefore, it is predicted that, as citizens adapt to COVID-19, activity levels will increase and adherence will decrease for measures such as staying indoors, social distancing, and always wearing a mask, resulting in a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 (Zhan et al. 2020) . Research analyzing 10 years of data found a strong correlation between infectious diseases and traffic volume; specifically, increased traffic during an infectious disease outbreak is associated with greater spread (Meloni et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2019 ). On analyzing 10 types of influenza from the last 300 years, a very close association with traffic was found. A disease that took 1 year to spread 300 years ago would now be able to reach anywhere in the world within a day due to the development of traffic (Rodrigue et al., 2020) .",

When the regional COVID-19 trends and traffic trends were analyzed in this study, the traffic in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon showed smaller changes compared to the other regions. This is because the Korean citizens, including overseas students, started returning to the country as COVID-19 began rapidly spreading overseas, such as in Europe and the US (Cho 2020 ). The number of Korean citizens returning from overseas and requiring control was estimated to be 210,000 individuals, because of which the risk of re-influx of COVID-19 is considerably high. Besides, 23.8% of the confirmed cases in Seoul in the third week of March were individuals returning from abroad (Young-kyung, 2020).

Particularly, the fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.",

The effectiveness of these policies is evidenced by the decrease in nationwide traffic. Particularly, this data shows that although the Korean government did not forcefully prohibit public excursions, citizens voluntarily adhered to the government's guidelines and restricted outdoor activities. Various studies and media opinions have suggested that these results are due to a high level of existing public health education, high information accessibility due to the rapid Internet environment, and effective delivery of educational messages. It would be valuable for future research to identify the most effective measures among the South Korean government's COVID-19 policies.Although the nationwide traffic in South Korea showed a continuously decreasing trend after the initial COVID-19 outbreak, it shifted to an increasing trend after March 7 th .
