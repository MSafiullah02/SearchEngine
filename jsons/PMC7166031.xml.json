Since diagnosing the first COVID-19 patient in Japan on January 16th, 2020, all patients identified during January had either travel history to an affected area in China, or known close contact with a COVID-19 patient. Health checks and testing for COVID-19 during this early phase were mainly performed based on epidemiological information such as travel histories and sick contacts. However, during mid-February, sporadic cases without significant travel histories or sick contacts have been publicized in Japan, leading to community recognition of the infection. Although the disease severity and case fatality ratio are currently not fully understood and cannot be determined during the ongoing outbreak, it is apparent that intensive care will be necessary for severe COVID-19 patients [[6], [7], [8]]. Preparations to prevent healthcare workers from infection and nosocomial spread from unexpected exposure to the disease could prove challenging when providing urgent and intensive care.",

These precautions include triage criteria and personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff, in order to safely manage unexpected COVID-19-positive ambulant transfers. All patients with respiratory failure, regardless of travel history and sick contact, were served by staff wearing PPE (N95 respirator mask, long sleeved gown, gloves, goggles, or face shields) (Fig. 1\n). They were isolated in a room with environmental cleaning and sterilization processes, until sufficient medical history could be taken and initial investigations were performed and evaluated. On his arrival, he was taken directly to an isolated resuscitation room in our emergency department where above-mentioned precautions were performed by medical staff equipped with PPE. The initial physical examination revealed consciousness oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, body temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 117/83 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 79% with a 10 L/min oxygen reservoir mask.

As we could not identify microbiological or other possible non-infectious etiology from the initial investigations, concern for COVID-19 pneumonia was raised as one of the differentials. We decided to admit our patient to an isolated room under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. After admission, lung-protective mechanical ventilation and neuromuscular blockade (vecuronium) were initiated under sedation. His initial mechanical ventilator setting was volume-controlled mode, tidal volume of 400 mL (7 mL/kg predicted body weight), respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14, and FIO2 of 45%. Since the etiology of his pneumonia remained unknown on the first day of admission, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage with measures above precaution, and empirical treatment was started with ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours, azithromycin 500 mg every 24 hours, and peramivir 600 mg every 24 hours. We did not administer corticosteroids systemically.",

Since his respiratory failure was incompletely treated with optimal mechanical ventilation and medication, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was introduced thirty hours after hospitalization (hospital day 2, illness day 12). The femoral-jugular VV-ECMO was initiated via the right femoral vein for access (25 Fr cannula, inflow) and via the internal jugular vein for return (20 Fr cannula, outflow) with an initial blood flow of 4.5 L/min and sweep gas of 4.0 L (MERA centrifugal blood pump system HCS-CFP, Senko Medical Instrument). The cannulation was performed percutaneously with ultrasound and fluoroscopic imaging guidance, and the procedures were completed under the above precautions. The mechanical ventilator was set on a pressure-controlled mode with an inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O (above PEEP), respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, PEEP of 8, and FIO2 of 30%. After initiation of VV-ECMO, ECMO blood flow was maintained at 4.5 L until the day before removal. The sweep gas flow was maintained at 4 L/min of 100% oxygen (ECMO day 1\u20132), 10 L/min of 100% oxygen (ECMO day 3\u20137), and tapering was started from ECMO day 8.

Since lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg (LPV/RTV) was available in our hospital, and contraindications and adverse effects were not a major concern in this case, especially considering the patient's worsening clinical course, LPV/RTV was administered (two tablets, twice daily) via a nasogastric tube for 14 days. Bradycardia with atrioventricular block was noted on the 2nd day of LPV/RTV treatment. At this time, other medications that may cause bradycardia, such as dexmedetomidine and azithromycin, were discontinued and no further intervention was required.

As of writing, it is challenging and could be premature to discuss the exact candidate of ECMO for COVID-19 patients in this phase of an outbreak, where the systematic collection of data is non-existent [9]. Since admission of our case, our most likely diagnosis was viral pneumonia, which we recognized as a reversible condition. When the respiratory condition deteriorated on hospital day 2, he did not suffer from multi-organ failure except for sole respiratory failure with Murray Score of 4, which we thought fulfilled the main indication of ECMO. These patient characteristics and presumptive conditions are likely to have been the important factors that benefited ECMO use and resulted in a favorable outcome. Other interventions such as prone positioning [6] could have been one of the choices for severe respiratory failure before initiating ECMO. However, because it requires additional staff to implement, and accidental extubation or disconnection of the ventilator tube may increase droplet exposure, we considered that the efficacy of prone positioning would not outweigh the safety of medical staff.",

The patient was already on mechanical ventilation and ECMO for respiratory support when LPV/RTV was started, and his clinical improvement may well be explained as the natural course of the disease under supportive care.

Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit.
