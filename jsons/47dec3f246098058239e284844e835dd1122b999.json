The inflammatory response controls virus replication but fails to mediate sterile clearance. The persistence of viral RNA and inflammatory cells within the CNS is associated with the development of ongoing demyelination. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). During inflammatory responses MMPs are thought to play a significant role in breaking down the basement membrane surrounding blood vessels as well as parenchymal ECM thereby facilitating leukocyte infiltration. MMPs have also been associated with activation of chemokines and perhaps more significantly the degradation of myelin proteins and generation of autoantigens. Recent examination of MMP expression during MHV infection suggests that MMP-3, -9 and -12 are involved in the inflammatory response. The proinflammatory effects of these MMPs are likely tempered by induction of tissue inhibiter of metalloproteinase-1 expression.",

MHV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) as a model of demyelinating disease has been studied extensively using strains derived from either the neurotropic JHM strain (MHV-JHM; MHV-4 serotype) or the MHV-A59 strain, which is both hepatotropic and neurotropic (33, 43) . As described by others, and ourselves acute MHV infection of the CNS induces a potent inflammatory response involving neutrophils, macrophages, NK, B and T cells (33, 43, 52) . In order to reach the site of infection, however, these cells must overcome physical barriers represented by the blood brain barrier as well as the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of the CNS parenchyma. The ability of leukocytes to extravasate from blood vessels and cross the parenchymal tissues is presumably dependent on the activity of extracellular proteases. One family of proteases, which are often associated with inflammatory responses are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The descriptions of MMP regulation and function during normal physiological as well as pathological conditions have been described in numerous publications (32, 23, 41) , thus only a brief summary is provided herein.",

            "text": "MMPs comprise a large group of endoproteinases that, in conjunction with other proteases, mediate degradation during remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Twenty four different MMPs have been identified and classified as collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysin and membrane type MMPs (MT-MMPs) based on their substrate specificities and protein domain structures (24,34). These proteases are produced by a wide range of cell types, including endothelial, inflammatory and stromal cells (18, 23, 32) . Regulation of MMP activity has been classically defined as occurring at three distinct levels. Primary regulation of MMP activity occurs at the transcriptional level (5, 12, 22, 30, 40) . MMP gene expression can be induced by a wide range of signals including acute phase cytokines such as IL-lc~ and -13, IL-6 and TNF-c~, and chemokines such as MIP113, and RANTES (6, 12, 22) . A second level of regulation for MMP activity is post-translational, as MMPs require proteolytic cleavage of their proenzyme form to become activated (4,34). Following translation, most proMMPs are released into the extracellular space. By contrast, a subgroup of membrane associated MMPs, the MT-MMPs, may play a role in the processing of secreted proMMPs to their active form (20). The final level of control for MMP activity resides in their regulation by a small group of specific inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (7) . TIMPs function primarily as specific inhibiters, binding to MMPs in a 1:1 stoicheometry. Interestingly, there is evidence that TIMPs may also act as chaperone proteins during the processing of MMPs from proenzyme to active form, suggesting that they can promote as well as inhibit MMP enzymatic activity, at least for 44) .",

However they have also been associated with diverse pathological processes from rheumatoid arthritis to tumor invasion and metastasis (16, 25) . A number of MMPs and TIMPs have also been associated with the CNS inflammatory/demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans (2,32) as well as its rodent model experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) (10,38). In the case of MS, these include MMP-1, -2, -3 -7 and -9 and TLMP-1 (2,11,32). These MMPs and TIMPs have been detected by immunohistochemistry in both inflammatory infiltrates and activated glia within acute MS lesions as well as perivascular infiltrates. Following EAE induction in mice, MMP-3, -9, -12 and -14 as well as TIMP-1 gene expression were induced within the CNS (38). MMP-1 and -10 were also induced although to a lesser degree than the aforementioned genes (38). The induction of MMP-7 mRNA expression was not detected but the presence of MMP-7 protein has also been reported during EAE in rats (10). The consistent association of MMP and TIMP expression with inflammatory demyelinating disease suggests that MMPs play either a direct or indirect role in promoting CNS pathology (2,27,32). However, as discussed below, identifying specific MMPs and their exact role in promoting inflammatory/demyelinating has proven to be difficult.",

These data are summarized in Table 1 . Kinetic analysis of MMP expression indicated that MMP-3 and MMP-12 expression peaked by 6 days post infection (p.i.) in accord with viral load, however, expression was significantly higher in lethally infected mice (51,52). Comparisons of MMP/TIMP expression in infected irradiated and control mice revealed relatively little loss in MMP or TIMP expression in immunosuppressed mice (51). These results indicated that CNS resident cells were responsible for the majority of MMP-3, and -12 gene expression detected within the brain and that this gene induction was relatively independent of the presence of inflammatory cell infiltration.

TIMP-1 expression was higher in lethally infected mice compared to sublethally infected mice suggesting that expression is dependent on viral load and/or virulence. T1MP-1 expression has been reported to be associated with both tissue resident cells as well as most inflammatory cells (7) . Expression levels of TIMP-1 were higher in irradiated, immuncompromised mice compared to control animals, indicating that most TIMP-1 is produced by CNS resident cells (51).",

            "text": "Analysis of whole brain samples for MMP RNA and protein failed to detect induction of MMP-9 expression during MHV infection (51), which was in sharp contrast to its prominence in MS. However, subsequent analysis of individual cell populations sorted from infected brains indicated that MMP-9 gene expression is up regulated several fold among infiltrating inflammatory cells (Zhou, unpublished data) (Table 1) . Similarly, a strong induction in TIMP-1 expression within the inflammatory cell populations (Zhou, unpublished data) suggests that T cells are, at least in part, a source of both MMP-9 and TIMP-1 as both of these genes are co-expressed by T cells (35). Furthermore, analysis of cell extracts prepared from infiltrating cells revealed that MHV infection also induced a sharp rise in the level of intracellular MMP-9 protein (51, 53). The increase in intracellular MMP-9 protein was attributed to the presence of polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates in response to infection (51, 53). Neutrophil synthesis of MMP-9 differs from other cell types in two key ways. First, in contrast to mononuclear cells, which release MMP-9 directly into the extracellular space, neutrophils store MMP-9 proenzyme in granules for release during degranulation (35), therefore permitting neutrophils to rapidly release large quantities of MMP-9 in the absence of de novo synthesis. Second, expression of MMP-9 in neutrophils is not linked to co-expression of TIMP-1 as is the case for T cells (35). Thus, MMP-9 from neutrophils is regulated at the level of degranulation as opposed to gene transcription and co-expression of TIMPs. These data suggest MMP-9 is likely released from both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltrates during JHMV infection. Thus, with the exception that MMP-7 was not detected during MHV infection (51), the overall expression patterns for both MMPs (-3, -9 and -12) and TIMP-1 during MHV infection, EAE and MS are extremely similar.",

MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are produced by both activated inflammatory as well as CNS resident cells (19, 35, 47) . MMP-9 is specific for type IV collagens, which make up the basement membrane surrounding the blood brain barrier (49). This suggests that MMP-9 contributes to the ability of activated inflammatory cells to cross this barrier. Support for the role of MMP-9 in T cell trafficking comes from MS patients undergoing IFN-13 treatment, one of the few therapeutics shown to have a positive effect. Although no single conclusive mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of IFN-[3 has been demonstrated, MMP-9 gene expression is down regulated by 45, 46) . Conversely, TIMP-I, which inhibits MMP-9, is up regulated by . This suggests that one of the mechanisms by which IFN-13 works is through inhibition of MMP-9 mediated inflammatory cell trafficking. These data are supported by treatment of EAE mice with MMP inhibitors, which have generally prevented disease induction or reduced clinical symptoms when treatment was initiated after active disease was apparent ( 17,21,28).",

However, as stated previously, confirmation of a specific role for MMPs in the inflammatory process is lacking. The use of knockout mice to determine the role of specific MMPs in inflammatory responses have generated mixed results, particularly in regard to blood brain barrier breakdown and inflammatory cell infiltration across endothelial cell barriers (1, 3, 14, 29) . This may in part be explained by the large number of MMPs with overlapping specificities as well as the presence of other proteases. Thus, although MMP expression is clearly associated with inflammatory responses during demyelinating disease, the role of individual MMPs as active participants or simply as markers remains to be determined.",
