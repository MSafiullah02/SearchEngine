A panel of locked nucleic acid based multiplex closed one-tube nested real-time PCR (mOTNRT-PCR) assay consisting of five separate internally controlled RT-qPCR assays was developed for detection of 14 respiratory viruses. The sensitivity and reproducibility of mOTNRT-PCR panel were evaluated using plasmid standards and the specificity was evaluated using clinical samples. The clinical performance of mOTNRT-PCR panel was further evaluated with 468 samples collected from patients with an acute respiratory infection and compared with individual real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. The analytical sensitivities of mOTNRT-PCR panel ranged from 2 to 20 copies/reaction, and no cross-reaction with common respiratory viruses was observed. The coefficients of variation of intra-assay and inter-assay were between 0.35% and 8.29%. Totally 35 clinical samples detected by mOTNRT-PCR assay panel were missed by RT-qPCR and confirmed true positive by sequencing of nested PCR products. The mOTNRT-PCR assay panel provides a more sensitive and high-throughput method for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses.",

The reproducibility of the mOTNRT-PCR was evaluated using three concentrations of mixed recombinant plasmids (10 6 , 10 4 , and 10 2 copies/\u00b5L). Intra-assay reproducibility and inter-assay reproducibility of mOTNRT-PCR were tested using three plasmids in three replicates and in three different days within a week.The specificity was retrospectively evaluated by using archived common respiratory viruses-positive samples previously tested by respiratory pathogen 13 detection kit(13 \u00d7 kit)    in our lab.23",

All the outer primers were modified by LNA. BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/Blast.cgi) was then performed to ensure the specificity of primers and probes. All the primers probes were tested using Oligo7 to minimize duplex formation and hairpin formation. The primers and probes were synthesized from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The detailed sequences of primer and probe are shown inTable 1.2.4 | Preparation of plasmid standardsPCR products of outer primers of mOTNRT-PCR assay panel targeting 14 respiratory viruses were cloned respectively by TsingKe Biotech Corp (Beijing, China) and confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Life technologies Invitrogen). For mOTNRT-PCR assay panel, each standard plasmid was adjusted to a concentration of 10 7 copies/\u00b5L and equally mixed in each assay.

Besides, the mOTNRT-PCR can detect 14 common respiratory viruses in five reactions in 2.7 hours and cost $7.5 (excluding nucleic acid extraction) for one sample. Compared with the mono RT-qPCR assay for detecting one virus per tube, the mOTNRT-PCR has the advantages of being highly sensitive, easy to operate, rapid, and costeffective. In addition, the human RNasep gene as an internal control can validate the RNA extraction procedure and prevent errors in the process of sampling and RT-PCR. As to the mixed infections, 165 of 468 (35.26%) specimens were detected by the mOTNRT-PCR, including 135 of 468 (28.85%), 29 of 468 (6.20%) and 1 of 468 (0.21%) samples involved in 2 viruses, 3 viruses, and 4 viruses, respectively.
