People who are tested for COVID-19 include those who have symptoms of the disease, such as fever, or acute respiratory infection (e.g. shortness of breath or cough), with or without fever, and have either travelled, or transited through, a country considered to pose a risk of transmission in the 14 days before illness onset, or have had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the 14 days before illness onset.2 Routine population screening is currently being conducted in some areas, however it has not been mandated by the Commonwealth. The Australian Commonwealth Government has recently announced Australian border closures, with some State Governments also shutting borders to domestic travelers. This is in addition to new social distancing measures, and the closure of non-essential services,3 in response to the continued growth of COVID-19 within the community.4\n",

However, the potential lack of workforce (i.e. pilots/engineers/clinical staff) has been identified as the major barrier to getting aircraft into the air.

However, our most significant barrier to providing additional services is a lack of engineers, to maintain aircraft, and clinical staff, to provide services. In the event of mass infection, and current staff potentially becoming unwell, we will need more staff to provide coverage. This could include having nursing and medical students providing paid (covered by insurance) support to senior clinicians, as recently recommended.13 Alternatively, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) could provide engineering and clinical support, as recently seen in the Australian bushfires.",

If mass infection occurred in rural and remote towns, it could have dire outcomes.
