A population-based survey was conducted in Hong Kong during 3 December 2003 through 4 January 2004; 475 Hong Kong Chinese adults participated in the survey. Perceptions of the infectivity and health conditions of recovered SARS patients and avoidance and discrimination towards them were measured. Of the respondents, 75.7% and 16.2%, respectively, believed that SARS could be transmitted via asymptomatic SARS patients and those patients who have recovered from SARS for 18 months; 72.7% of the respondents believed that the health of SARS patients would severely and permanently be damaged; 16.6% showed some tendency of avoiding recovered SARS patients and 35.7% expressed some sort of job-related discriminatory attitudes. Perceived infectivity of asymptomatic and recovered SARS patients, health sequelae and emotional distress from SARS were independently associated with avoidance and discriminatory attitudes. The study showed that misconceptions about the infectivity of asymptomatic and recovered SARS patients were common. Recovered SARS patients may also be facing avoidance and discrimination.",

Psychological distress due to SARS is therefore relevant in predicting related avoidance/discriminatory attitudes. Avoidance of these patients may also be considered by the actor to be a form of preventive behaviour. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to investigate preventive behaviours for various diseases [18, 19] , including SARS [20] . The model specifies that the practice of preventive behaviours is affected by perceptions including perceived efficacy of the preventive behaviour, perceived consequences and perceived susceptibility of the disease, barriers and cue to actions, etc. [21] . In this case, perceptions related to infectivity and health conditions of recovered SARS patients (i.e. perceived susceptibility and consequences) are most relevant in predicting attitudes related to protective (avoidance) behaviours which can be translated into discriminatory attitudes against these patients.",

About 16% of the respondents believed that even 18 months after recovery, SARS patients are still infectious and that at the time of the study, dining and shaking hands with recovered SARS patients would transmit the virus. Yet, no SARS cases had been detected after the reporting of the last case in the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The mortality of SARS has been overestimated. The case fatality rate in Hong Kong was <5% for those who were of age <65 [27] . However, 45% of the respondents believed that the rate was >10%. Around April 2003, ;52% of the general population believed that SARS was lethal [2] . Further, 75% of the public believed that the health sequelae of contracting SARS are severe and irreversible and about half of them believed that recovered SARS patients were unable to handle demanding jobs at the time of the survey.

SARS differ from other infectious diseases in that it became a severe global epidemic within a short period of time while there was almost no information about recovered patients' infectivity and health consequences. Fear was therefore easily induced and avoidance/discrimination against recovered SARS patients was prone to develop. The provision of knowledge has been shown to be successful in reducing HIVrelated discrimination and is much warranted [28] . It is important to rectify misconceptions in the general populations. The results of this study therefore show that HBM may also be applicable for studying avoidance behaviours related to infectious diseases, especially those new ones with incomplete knowledge (e.g. SARS and human avian flu).",

Education level was, however, not statistically significant, which was different from results of similar studies on discrimination on HIV/AIDS [12] . It is possible that there is a better knowledge base for HIV/AIDS or disability as compared with SARS and such favours those who attained university education. SARS, however, being a novel disease would be much less affected by gender or education level. Seemingly, there may be less gender and sociodemographic differences in SARSrelated discrimination, as compared with HIVrelated discrimination. In HIV research, similar findings that knowledge and misconceptions about modes of transmission (such as HIV transmission via daily social contacts) were associated with discrimination towards PLWHA were reported [12, 29, 30] .

Similar Knowledge, Attitude, Beliefs and Practices studies using telephone surveys are quite common [2, 22] . Second, the response rate was not very high (61.8%) though it is comparable with many other telephone surveys conducted in Hong Kong [2, 22, 33] . The gender and age compositions of this study are similar to those of the Census distribution (Census: % male = 47.5% and % aged 45-60 = 32.9%; this study: % male = 45.3% and % aged 45-60 = 36.5%) [34] . Reporting biases due to social desirability may exist. Yet, the direction of such biases should favour under-reporting of avoidance/ discrimination responses. Measurement of avoidance/discriminatory attitudes may be another limitation although the items were mainly adopted from local HIV surveys; validated scales on measuring avoidance/discrimination towards SARS patients was used as they do not exist. A panel of researchers assessed the face validity of these items but test-retest had not been performed. Further, Social avoidance of recovered SARS patients in Hong Kong only the dimensions on avoiding contacts and job-related discrimination have been studied. It is uncertain whether such perceptions would persist over time. The study only investigated perceptions, not behaviours. Perceptions may not result in behaviours though the two are correlated with each other. The role of the media has not been covered by this study. The reasons for exhibiting discriminatory attitudes behind have not been sought in this study. Qualitative studies are required to investigate reasons operating behind the observed perceptions. Further studies are therefore warranted.",
