Whether it is the threat of terrorism, climate change resulting in flooding, or a new virus for which there is no cure, the health care system will be on the forefront of response. The ability of hospitals, health care systems and the emergency medical system (EMS) to quickly transfer patients, be ready for critically injured people, provide medical counter measures (MCMs), or to initiate just-in-time training to staff to keep people safe is always uppermost for any first responder or hospital first receiver.1 The role of the nurse in emergency preparedness may not always be visible. Historically, the nurse has not only been the bedside caregiver but a leader in seeing the larger picture when it applies to the hospital or health care community. Nursing process involves collaboration, which is the foundation for effective emergency preparedness and the process of emergency management.2\n",

The disaster plan began in the emergency department (ED) and ended when the patient was admitted to the hospital, died, or was discharged. Leadership for the hospital disaster plan was often carried out by nurses and other hospital leaders including: the nurse manager in the ED, trauma nurse coordinator, ED medical director, trauma medical director, hospital safety officer, or the hospital facility manager. Hospital EDs maintained a supply of medical surgical supplies, triage tags, and premade patient charts. The hospital engineering staff checked the emergency generator as part of the requirements for facility management, and load bank tests were carried out. Training on the hospital disaster plan usually occurred once a year and included a review of specific processes through table-top exercises. The greatest effort for training usually occurred in the ED. It is important to note that things have now changed.",

This act provided training to first responders (police and fire department) and to assist with the formation of metropolitan medical strike teams (MMSTs). WMD incidents are defined as terrorist-driven biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear terrorism events. Training was provided to the 120 largest cities in the United States (by 1990 census data). The training, funded by the US Department of Defense (DoD), leveraged interagency coordination between US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Department of Justice, and the DoD. Hospitals or the personnel responsible for emergency preparedness were not specifically included for training.5 High-profile events such as the Atlanta Summer Olympics (1996) and the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics (2002) provided additional federal funds for first responders, public safety, and the development of patient care protocols. Hospitals may also choose to part of the National Medical Disaster System (NDMS). NDMS is a federal program comprised of partnerships between the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA). NDMS hospitals provide internal surge capability for disasters occurring in the United States, and also provide support to the military and VA hospital systems in providing casualty care for injured personnel from overseas conflicts.",

The grant program supported health-related activities to prepare for and respond effectively to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including the preparation of an emergency preparedness plan. Programmatic emphasis moved to an all-hazards capability-based approach in 2004, and encouraged collaboration in the development of a hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA). The HVA is the base or identification of potential threats to the hospital (or the community), from which all emergency preparedness planning is derived. The HVA is to an emergency preparedness plan as a comprehensive patient history is to developing the nursing care plan; it is difficult to have one without the other if one wants to achieve success.",

Hospital and health care facility evacuation became a focal event with the landfall of the 2012 Hurricane Sandy in New York City. Hospitals are required to have evacuation plans as part of accreditation and US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulatory requirements; however, they are rarely if ever fully tested due to patient acuity. Flooding and back-up generator failure led to the unplanned evacuation of several large downtown hospitals including New York University (NYU) Langone and Bellevue Hospital. The New York Downtown Hospital evacuated prior to landfall of the hurricane, as did the Veterans Administration Manhattan Hospital. Established relationships with other hospital systems and other elements that were present in the coalition contributed to the successful evacuation of multiple hospitals.13\n",

            "text": "One of the hallmarks of PHEP and HPP has been development of coalitions. Coalitions have existed prior to the development of the HPP. Coalitions developed with the CSEPP program, Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), Metropolitan Strike Teams, and now with the hospital preparedness program. Coalitions are locally or regionally based. Membership within coalitions is defined at the local level (city, county, state, or region). Coalitions have established leaders who have specific roles and responsibilities as well as an organizational framework. Individual organizational support is identified through the development of an MOU or memorandum of agreement. Such agreements articulate roles and responsibilities, identify the process for distribution of funding sources, and facilitate the integration of the preparedness community. For example, some coalitions have used HPP grant dollars to purchase equipment, creating communications networks between facilities and first responder partners. They have purchased caches of supplies and established community-based emergency preparedness exercises. Coalitions exist as a result of established day-to-day relationships within a hospital and between hospitals and public health partners. Relationships develop that include levels of trust, familiarity, and dependability. Coalitions have expanded outside the hospital/public health boundaries to include skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities, all of which are part of the fabric of health care providers in the community. Many coalitions share training schedules, offer joint educational or preparedness conferences, and act as mentors to other health care partners as they develop emergency preparedness plans for their organizations. In times of emergency, knowing one\u2019s coalition partners and how to reach them quickly can help keep health care services intact. The ability to bounce back in the face of disaster is the hallmark of resilience.14 As of 2016, funding levels for both the HPP and PHEP program have been cut, forcing hospitals to determine whether participation in regional coalitions, planning efforts, and exercises is still worth their financial support.",
