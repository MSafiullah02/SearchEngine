Infectious diseases have a significant impact on the productivity and efficiency of the livestock industry. Current methods routinely used for detection of pathogens that affect livestock are primarily tests that detect a single agent. Assays that simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single reaction can potentially reduce the time, labour and cost of diagnostic testing and disease surveillance. Microarrays can be used to identify the presence of a large number of genetic sequences in parallel and have been used to detect and subtype viruses that affect livestock (Ban\u00e9r et al., 2007; Barrette et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Lung et al., 2011, 2015; Nicholson et al., 2011).",

The Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) has successfully eradicated rinderpest circulating in the wild in 2011, but rinderpest remains a notifiable disease, and surveillance systems must be maintained for detection of clinical cases resulting from accidental or intentional release of the virus from the laboratory.

Primers used in the RT\u2010PCR for specific amplification of the targeted viruses were used with or without a primer pair for enterovirus armored RNA to evaluate the potential for incorporation of an internal control.

Reverse transcription was carried out for 30 min at 50\u00b0C and followed by denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min. The PCR consisted of 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min; 50\u00b0C for 1 min; and 68\u00b0C for 1.5 min, followed by a final extension step of 68\u00b0C for 5 min.

This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a novel microarray platform that integrates and automates capture probe printing with all post\u2010amplification steps of a microarray assay (e.g. hybridization, washing, reporting) for detection and differentiation of eight bovine viruses. The post\u2010PCR automated electronic microarray process described here takes approximately 4 h to complete and requires a NanoChip 400 instrument and microfluidic electronic microarray cartridges with 400 test sites. The multiplex PCR and microarray assay accurately detected a panel of 37 strains of the target viruses, and the capture probes showed no cross\u2010reactivity with heterologous viruses, 23 non\u2010target viruses including ones that are related genetically, or cause similar clinical signs in ruminants, and samples from healthy animals. For laboratories without the electronic microarray instrumentation and specialized consumables, the multiplex PCR may potentially be used as a stand\u2010alone assay as the size of the amplicons for each target with the exception of BVDV and VSV is different. As seen in previous electronic microarray assays developed for pathogens that affect poultry and porcine, the assay was able to detect viruses in clinical samples and also mixed infections in samples with two different viruses (Lung et al., 2012, 2015). Based on available data for VSV, the electronic microarray results were comparable to an in\u2010house real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Both tests detected the VSV\u2010IND strain tested at 2 dpi, and the electronic microarray detected the tested VSV\u2010NJ strain at 2 dpi, 1 day earlier than the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Although not thoroughly investigated in this study, previous published and ongoing unpublished work on the electronic microarray platform have shown that depending on the assay and the target, the sensitivity of multiplex PCRs can be comparable, or sometimes less than the component singleplex PCRs. In this study, we further observed that the downstream electronic microarray had a lower sensitivity for BoHV\u20101 and PPV when compared with the multiplex PCR. This reduced sensitivity for some targets on the microarray when compared with the preceding multiplex PCR has been observed in other electronic microarray assays (O. Lung, unpublished results).",

            "text": "The electronic microarray platform has several unique features as a potential tool for pathogen detection and typing. The ability to computer\u2010control the printing of all capture probes, all post\u2010PCR steps of a microarray analysis on a single instrument, and activate each of the 400 test sites of the microarray independently gives the user the ability to customize assay configurations on\u2010site for any subset or the entire set of target viruses. Thus, there is no need to predetermine targets and stockpile pre\u2010printed array. The ability of the platform to electrophoretically address amplicons to the array also allows instantaneous hybridization when compared to passive hybridization. The stringency of detection can be modulated by computer\u2010controlled washing and reporting temperature, and the use of temperature gradients (stepwise increase or decrease in temperature). By increasing the stringency for detection sequences found in different strains, viruses with a minimum of three mismatches can be successfully differentiated (O. Lung, unpublished results). New instrumentation that further integrates PCR amplification with the automated microarray in a single computer\u2010controlled instrument has been developed that will further streamline the workflow of microarray\u2010based assays. Despite a thorough in silico evaluation of the primers and probes against publically available sequences of the genetically variable BTV serotypes 1\u201324 at the time of assay design, further evaluation of primers and probe sequences against new sequences as they become available is necessary. Due to limited resources in this project, additional validation with true field samples, and incorporation of an internal control, is desirable, especially with upcoming new instrumentation that further integrates PCR with the electronic microarray. With further validation, electronic microarray assays have potential as a tool for surveillance of multiple targets or may be used in conjunction with a real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR for FMDV (Reid et al., 2002, 2003; King et al., 2006; Moniwa et al., 2007) for rapid and simultaneous differential diagnosis of FMD\u2010like vesicular diseases in cattle.",

(a) Agarose gel image of RT\u2010PCR amplicons and (b) heat map of the reactivity of the minimal set of 10 probes. Probes and viral strains are grouped according to species and serotype and are listed on the right or above the heat map, respectively. The order of viral strains is BVDV type 1 strains New York 1 (Type 1b), Singer (Type 1a), Hastings (Type 1b); BVDV type 2 strains 24515, 890, Ames 125c; BoHV\u20101 strains Colorado #34, V654, V135, Edmonton #5, Edmonton #39, V76; VSV New Jersey serotype strains 0185 PNB, 0804 COE1, 1184 HDB, 89 GAS, 92 CLB, New Mexico 95; VSV Indiana serotype strains 85 CLB, 94 GUB, 97 CRB, 98 COE, Indiana (ATCC), IND1 02V1008; RPV strains Kabete O, Eldoret, Buffalo Pakchong; MCFV strain WC11 9101; PPV strain Orf NZ2; BTV serotype 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 17; non\u2010template control (NTC). Positive reactions (positive\u2010to\u2010negative, P : N ratio greater or equal to 2) are indicated in shades of red that corresponds with the strength of the signal, and negative reactions (P : N ratio <2) are indicated in black. Note that the PPV (Orf virus) sample generated two amplicons which reacted as expected with the PPV\u2010specific capture probe, and also with the probe for type 2 BVDV and a BVDV/BDV probe designed to detect both BVDV 1, 2 and BDV. NTC represents the non\u2010template control, and negative control probe represents a non\u2010specific\u2010binding control probe. The approximate amplicon size for each virus is different and is listed in Table 1.",
