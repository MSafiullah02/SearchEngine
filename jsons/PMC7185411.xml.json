The formation or breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate is thought to be rate limiting. Westerik and Wolfenden [6] first suggested that the tight binding of aldehyde inhibitors to papain might be attributed to formation of a thiohemiacetal analogous to the tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis. Saturation transfer experiments suggested that papain formed a thiohemiacetal with aldehyde inhibitors [7]. This was confirmed by the direct observation of thiohemiacetal formation with papain [8], [9] and with the hepatitis A virus protease [10] using 13C-NMR. Likewise 13C-NMR has been used to show that aldehyde inhibitors can form two diastereomeric hemiacetals with the serine proteases [5], [11], [12]. However, with the cysteine protease papain thiohemiacetal formation was stereospecific with only one diastereoisomeric thiohemiacetal being formed with both aldehyde [9] and glyoxal inhibitors [13]. Likewise with glyoxal inhibitors hemiketal formation with the serine proteases has been shown to be stereospecific [14], [15], [16] and stabilized by up to a factor of ~ 200,000 [4] by enzyme interactions.",

It has been argued [21] that with substrates or inhibitors with large groups extending into the S1\u2032 subsite the carbonyl oxygen must point into the oxyanion hole as the bulky leaving group is too large to occupy the oxyanion hole. However, with aldehyde inhibitors the aldehyde proton could fit in the oxyanion hole and the carbonyl oxygen could point towards the catalytic histidine residue [21].",

Therefore in this paper we have quantified thiohemiacetal formation with both aldehyde and glyoxal inhibitors of papain. The effective molarity of the catalytic thiol group of papain is the molarity of an analogous low molecular weight thiol group which would be required to be as effective as the catalytic thiol group of papain under the same experimental conditions. For chymotrypsin the effective molarity is the molarity of water required to be as effective as the catalytic serine hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin. By comparing the effective molarity of the catalytic thiol group of papain with that of the catalytic serine hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin we intend to quantify the formation and stabilization of tetrahedral adducts by these enzymes. This should allow us to determine whether or not papain and chymotrypsin stabilize the tetrahedral adducts of aldehyde and glyoxal peptide inhibitors by similar amounts.",

Commercial papain contains irreversibly denatured papain and papain reversibly inhibited by forming a mixed disulphide with cysteine. Consequently, it is necessary to activate the reversibly inhibited papain by incubating it with a large excess of cysteine at alkaline pH. Therefore ~ 50 \u03bcM Papain was activated by incubation for 30 min in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer containing 30 mM EDTA and 50 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine at pH 8.3. The amount of papain was estimated using a E280\n = 56,000 M\u2212 1\n cm\u2212 1\n[40]. A mean value (12 determinations) of 54.79 \u00b1 6.69 M\u2212 1\n s\u2212 1 for kcat/KM was determined from the inhibition experiments at pH 7.0 with Ac-Phe-Gly-H and Ac-Phe-Gly-COOH (Table 1\n) as described in the legend to Fig. 1\n. For fully active papain at pH 7.0 a kcat/KM value of 231 M\u2212 1\n s\u2212 1 is expected [41]. Therefore from these numbers we estimate that after activation the papain was 24 \u00b1 3% fully active.

The Ki of Z-Phe-Ala-H (Scheme 1A) was determined but due to the low solubility of Z-Phe-Ala-COOH (Scheme 1B) its Ki value with papain was not determined (Table 1). With the serine protease chymotrypsin replacing the \u03b1-carboxylate group of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-COOH and Z-Ala-Pro-Phe-COOH with a hydrogen atom to give Z-Ala-Ala-H and Z-Ala-Pro-Phe-H respectively led to 3\u20134 fold tighter binding (Table 1). This was expected because we would expect that for optimal catalytic efficiency enzymes would bind products less tightly than substrates [4]. However, replacing the \u03b1-carboxylate group of Ac-Phe-Gly-COOH (Scheme 1B) with a hydrogen atom to give Ac-Phe-Gly-H (Scheme 1A) resulted in a 3.4 fold decrease in the tightness of binding (Table 1) showing that the \u03b1-carboxylate group promotes binding to papain. This demonstrates that the expulsion of the product in the papain catalysed reaction is less efficient than in chymotrypsin catalysed reactions.",

Therefore it is not surprising that specific peptide derived glyoxals (ZAPF-COCHO & ZAAF-COCHO) are potent inhibitors of the serine proteases (Table 1) with the catalytic serine hydroxyl group reacting with the glyoxal keto-carbon to form a hemiketal (Scheme 5B) which mimics the tetrahedral intermediate formed (Scheme 5A) during the catalysis of peptide substrates [14], [15], [16], [46], [47]. The specific peptide derived glyoxal Z-Phe-Ala-COCHO (Scheme 1D) is also a potent inhibitor of the cysteine protease papain [13] and its glyoxal keto-carbon is also expected to be in a position equivalent to the carbonyl carbon of a substrate peptide bond. However, using 13C-NMR it has been shown that the catalytic thiol group of papain does not react with the keto-carbon of the glyoxal, instead it reacts with the aldehyde carbon of the glyoxal group [13]. Therefore the thiohemiacetal formed with papain and the glyoxal inhibitor is not a good mimic of the tetrahedral intermediate formed during the catalysis of peptide substrates by papain. Despite this the dipeptide glyoxal inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-COCHO (Scheme 1D) is a more potent papain inhibitor than the tripeptide glyoxal inhibitors of chymotrypsin (Table 1). Using 13C-NMR it has been shown that the thiolate ion of the catalytic cysteine residue of papain forms a thiohemiacetal with the aldehyde carbon of the aldehyde inhibitor Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO (Scheme 1C) [8], [9]. The aldehyde carbon of Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO is equivalent to the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond hydrolyzed during catalysis and so the thiohemiacetal formed by papain with the aldehyde inhibitor is expected to be a good mimic of the tetrahedral intermediate formed during substrate catalysis.",

However, replacing the aldehyde and glyoxal groups with a hydrogen atom allows us to determine the contribution of the peptide moiety to inhibitor potency [4] and shows that the Z-Phe-Ala-H peptide (Scheme 1A) is bound ~ 10 \u00d7 more tightly (Table 1) than the Ac-Phe-Gly-H peptide (Scheme 1A). By dividing the Ki values for the aldehyde and glyoxal inhibitors by the Ki values for Ac-Phe-H (Scheme 1A) and Z-Phe-Ala-H (Scheme 1A) respectively we can quantify how much the aldehyde and glyoxal group contribute to inhibitor binding. Doing this shows that with papain, the aldehyde (Scheme 1C) and glyoxal groups (Scheme 1D) increase inhibitor binding ~ 1,000,000 and ~ 300,000 fold respectively (Table 1). In contrast with serine protease chymotrypsin, the aldehyde (ZAAF-CHO) and glyoxal groups (ZAAF-COCHO and Z-APF-COCHO) increase inhibitor binding ~ 100 and 460\u20132300 fold respectively (Table 1). Therefore, the aldehyde and glyoxal groups were 100\u201310,000 fold more effective at increasing inhibitor binding with papain compared to their effect with chymotrypsin (Table 1). In order to understand how the aldehyde and glyoxal groups are able to increase the binding of inhibitors to the serine and cysteine proteases we have examined the mechanism of inhibition.",

The aldehyde group of acetyl-Phe-Gly-CHO (A in Scheme 2\n) undergoes hydration (AH in Scheme 2) in water and Scheme 2 is the minimal scheme we have used to analyse thiohemiacetal (THA) formation with papain. The hydration constant KH1(obs)\n = [AH]/[A], Ks is the dissociation constant (Ks\n = [E][A]/[EA]) of the non-covalent enzyme inhibitor complex (EA) and KTHA is the equilibrium constant for thiohemiacetal formation (KTHA\n = [THA]/[EA]). The observed binding constant Ki(obs)\n = [E]([A] + [AH])/([EA] + [THA]) and so after substituting for Ks, KH1(obs) and KTHA we get Eq. (1) which can be re-arranged to give Eq. (2). If it is assumed that the Ki(obs) value for acetyl-Phe-Gly-H is a good approximation for Ks then the equilibrium constant (KTHA) for the formation of the papain thiohemiacetal with acetyl-Phe-Gly-CHO could be calculated (Table 2\n) using Eq.

It is clear that thiohemiacetal formation with papain is ~ 4000\u201320,000 times more effective than either hemiacetal or hemiketal formation with chymotrypsin (Table 2). Therefore both aldehyde and glyoxal warheads would appear to have a much higher specificity for the cysteine protease papain than the serine protease chymotrypsin suggesting that these warheads should be used to preferentially target the cysteine proteases. For the aldehyde inhibitors the aldehyde carbon is expected to be in the same position as the peptide carbonyl carbon of a substrate. However, in glyoxal inhibitors, the aldehyde carbon is one carbon bond away from this position. Despite this thiohemiacetal formation (KTHA) is 1.6 times more effective with the glyoxal group compared to the aldehyde group (Table 2). This suggests that it is the greater reactivity of the more electrophilic glyoxal aldehyde group compared to the aldehyde carbonyl group that makes glyoxals more effective at thiohemiacetal formation.",

Likewise with chymotrypsin both hemiacetal (KHA) and hemiketal (KHK) formation are stabilized by similar amounts. However, with papain thiohemiacetal formation is ~ 10,000 times more effective than either hemiacetal or hemiketal formation with chymotrypsin (Table 2). Therefore, we need to determine whether papain is 10,000 times more effective than chymotrypsin at stabilizing tetrahedral adducts or are thiohemiacetals 10,000 times more easily formed than hemiacetals or hemiketals, or is the factor of 10,000 a combination of both these factors? To answer this question we examined the effective molarity of the catalytic thiol group and catalytic serine hydroxyl of papain and chymotrypsin respectively. For chymotrypsin the effective molarity was determined by the ratio of the reactivity of the catalytic serine hydroxyl relative to that of the hydroxyl groups of water (Table 3) while for papain the effective molarity was determined by the reactivity of the catalytic thiol group of papain relative to the thiol group of Ac-Cys (Table 4). Increases in effective molarity are usually due to the entropic advantage of having both reactants in the same molecule. However in a protein complex other factors such as specific hydrogen bonds, general acid\u2013base catalysis and ion pair interactions may also make significant contributions to the effective molarity. Therefore the effective molarity reflects the reactivity of the nucleophile (sulphur or oxygen) as well as the total stabilization achieved within the enzyme-inhibitor complex.",

With the glyoxal inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-COCHO the glyoxal keto-carbon is expected to be in a position analogous to that of the peptide carbonyl carbon of the corresponding substrate [13]. However, it has been shown using 13C-NMR that the catalytic thiol group of papain does not react with the keto carbon equivalent to the peptide carbonyl carbon, instead it reacts with the aldehyde carbon of the glyoxal inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-COCHO to form a thiohemiacetal [13]. Therefore this thiohemiacetal will not be in a position equivalent to that of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate and so it is not expected to be optimally stabilized by papain. This explains the low effective molarity observed when papain is inhibited by the glyoxal inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-COCHO (Table 4). However, the aldehyde carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde inhibitor Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO reacts stereospecifically with the catalytic thiol group of papain [8], [9] and so it might be expected to be in a position analogous to that of peptide carbonyl during catalysis. Therefore the thiohemiacetal formed could have a similar structure to the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis and so it might be expected to be optimally stabilized by papain.

            "text": "However, X-ray studies of papain show that the side chain NH2 group of Gln-19 and the amide proton of Cys-25 are located in the papain oxyanion hole in positions that should allow them to hydrogen bond to the oxyanion of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate [19], [20]. Removing one of these hydrogen bonds by changing Gln-19 to Ala-19 resulted in a 60 fold reduction in kcat/KM\n[33], suggesting that hydrogen bonding by Gln-19 to the oxyanion of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate enhances catalysis by papain. Asn-155 is in an analogous position in the serine protease subtilisin and mutating it to an alanine produces a larger 180\u20131200 fold decrease in kcat/KM\n[49], [50] suggesting that hydrogen bonding to the oxyanion is 20\u201330 times more effective in the serine proteases than in the thiol proteases. The Asn155Ala mutation in a subtilisin-chloromethylketone inhibitor adduct raised the oxyanion pKa by 1.09 pKa units [50] even though oxyanion hydrogen bonding is not optimal in chloromethylketone inhibitor adducts [51]. In contrast, the analogous Gln19Ala mutation in papain decreased the Ki value for Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO from 36 to 21 nM instead of raising it, showing that Gln-19 does not stabilize thiohemiacetal formation in the papain/Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO complex [33]. X-ray crystallographic studies with a range of aldehyde inhibitor complexes formed with cysteine proteases have shown that the thiohemiacetal oxygen can lie in the oxyanion hole (Scheme 4A) [27], [28], [30] or it can point away from the oxyanion hole hydrogen bonding with N\u03b52 of the catalytic histidine (Scheme 4B or C) [1], [29], [30]. Therefore the fact that mutating Gln-19 to Ala-19 does not increase Ki for the binding of Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO to papain shows that the thiohemiacetal oxygen is not located in the oxyanion hole (Scheme 4A) and that it is expected to be hydrogen bonded to N\u03b52 of the catalytic histidine (Scheme 4B or C).",

The thiohemiacetal oxygen is in the oxyanion hole 2.83 \u00c5 from the side chain amide nitrogen of Gln-19 and 3.39 \u00c5 from the backbone amide nitrogen of Cys-25 (Scheme 4A). The oxyanion is ideally ~ 3 \u00c5 from the NH of Cys-25 and so the thiohemiacetal oxyanion is slightly displaced from its ideal location in the oxyanion hole. If the thiohemiacetal formed between papain and the Z-Phe-Ala-COCHO glyoxal inhibitor has a similar structure (Scheme 4A) then this suggests that the more effective thiohemiacetal stabilization with Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO aldehyde inhibitor (Table 4) must be due to its interaction with the catalytic histidine (Schemes 4B and 4C). It has been suggested [21] that it is a neutral thiohemiacetal that interacts with the histidine (Scheme 4C). However, this neutral hydrogen bond (Scheme 4C) would be expected to be weaker than the charged oxyanion hydrogen bonds formed in the oxyanion hole (Scheme 4A). However, the interaction between the oxyanion and a positively charged histidine (Scheme 4B) should be much stronger, which could explain why there is more effective thiohemiacetal formation with Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO (Table 4). It would also explain why for Ac-Phe-Gly-CHO the thiohemiacetal oxygen is not in the oxyanion hole but instead interacts with histidine-159.",

But only the hemiacetal which has its hemiacetal oxygen in the oxyanion hole is expected to be a good analogue of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate. However, as both hemiacetals are observed then they must be stabilized by similar amounts. The fact that for the serine proteases the effective molarity observed with aldehyde inhibitors is lower than that observed with glyoxal inhibitors (Table 3) shows that hemiketal stabilization is more effective than hemiacetal stabilization in the serine proteases (Table 3). It has been suggested that this is because the larger glyoxal group can fix the catalytic histidine in position (Scheme 5B) as with substrates (Scheme 5A), helping raise the histidine pKa > 11 which lowers the oxyanion pKa and ensures that the oxyanion is in the oxyanion hole [5].",

However, we have found that thiohemiacetal stabilization (as measured by effective molarity) with aldehyde inhibitors and papain (Table 4) is comparable to the hemiketal stabilization (effective molarity) observed with chymotrypsin and glyoxal inhibitors (Table 3). Therefore we conclude that both papain and chymotrypsin can stabilize tetrahedral adducts by similar amounts. This suggests that earlier suggestions [31], [32] that oxyanion stabilization is much less effective in papain than in chymotrypsin are incorrect and that the later suggestions [33], [34], [35] that oxyanion stabilization is important in papain catalysis are correct. With specific peptide derived glyoxal inhibitors the glyoxal keto carbon is expected to be in the same position as the peptide carbonyl of a substrate. It is most probably the larger size of the sulphur nucleophile in papain that allows it to react with the more reactive glyoxal aldehyde group whereas the smaller oxygen nucleophile in chymotrypsin cannot do this.",

It has also been observed in a position between these two states which has led to the suggestion that it was exchanging between its position in the oxyanion hole (Scheme 6A) and a position corresponding to that of the leaving peptide nitrogen of a peptide substrate (Schemes 5A, 5B) [57]. These are analogous positions to the two alternative hemiacetal conformations observed when aldehyde inhibitors form hemiacetals with chymotrypsin. In both cases the absence of a large leaving group allows the hemiacetal and the acyl intermediate to adopt more than one conformation. Therefore hemiacetals can adopt similar conformations to the catalytic acyl intermediate in the serine proteases. Likewise with thiohemiacetals formed with the cysteine proteases and aldehyde inhibitors the thiohemiacetal oxygen can lie in the oxyanion hole (Scheme 4A) [27], [28], [30] or it can point away from the oxyanion hole hydrogen bonding with N\u03b52 of the catalytic histidine (Scheme 4B or C) [1], [29], [30].

This is because the lack of a large leaving group allows them to adopt similar conformations to acyl intermediates. Also the lack of a large leaving group with hemiacetals and thiohemiacetals means that the catalytic histidine is not fixed in position and its pKa is not raised to a value > 10. Therefore the sp3 hybridized thiohemiacetals and hemiacetals formed with aldehyde inhibitors are not good analogues of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate but may well be better analogues of the sp2 hybridized catalytic acyl or thioacyl intermediates which lack a group equivalent to a large substrate leaving group.",

It is therefore not surprising that the effective molarities observed with chymotrypsin and glyoxal inhibitors (Table 3) are greater than those observed with the aldehyde inhibitors and chymotrypsin (Table 3). This shows that with chymotrypsin the tetrahedral adducts formed with glyoxal inhibitors are much better analogues of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate than the tetrahedral adducts formed with aldehyde inhibitors.",

The effective molarity of the catalytic thiol group of papain is ~ 40 times greater with aldehyde inhibitors than with glyoxal inhibitors (Table 4). This shows that the inhibitor aldehyde carbonyl carbon must be in a position equivalent to a substrate peptide carbonyl for optimal thiohemiacetal formation. Thiohemiacetal formation when papain reacts with peptide aldehyde or glyoxal inhibitors is ~ 10,000 times more effective than when chymotrypsin forms hemiacetals and hemiketals with aldehyde and glyoxal inhibitors respectively (Table 2). As the effective molarity of the catalytic thiol group of papain with the aldehyde inhibitor (Table 4) is similar to the effective molarity observed when the catalytic hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin reacts with glyoxal inhibitors (Table 3) then this shows that stabilization of the thiohemiacetal oxyanion (Scheme 4B) or its conjugate acid (Scheme 4C) by hydrogen bonding to N\u03b52 of the catalytic histidine is as effective as stabilization of hemiketal oxyanion in the oxyanion hole of chymotrypsin (Scheme 5B). Therefore we conclude that our results show that the cysteine protease papain can stabilize tetrahedral adducts by similar amounts to the serine protease chymotrypsin.",
