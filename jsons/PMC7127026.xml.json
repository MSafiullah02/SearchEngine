Others have assessed the role of cytokines, peptidic or glycopeptidic mediators of the immune system, during the course of the disease. Beck et al. (1988)were the first to show that PBMC of individual MS patients produced increased amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 at an early stage of an exacerbation of the disease, thus preceding the clinical manifestation of a relapse. These findings were later confirmed for TNF-\u03b1 on the mRNA level (Rieckmann et al., 1995). TNF-\u03b1 is understood to play a crucial role in the upregulation of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and leukocytes, therefore being essentially involved in T-cell migration to the sites of inflammation (Hartung et al., 1995). Furthermore, high levels of expression of proinflammatory as well as immunosuppressive cytokines were detected in MS lesions of postmortem CNS tissue by means of immunocytochemistry (Cannella and Raine, 1995).",

All patients were examined and classified independently by two clinical neurologists and informed consent was obtained. 10 patients were seen during an acute episode of new disease activity (acute relapse) and 11 patients were in a stable condition. An acute relapse was defined as significant worsening of preexisting symptoms as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (Kurtzke, 1983) or appearance of new neurological deficits lasting for at least 24 h. None of the patients had signs of systemic infections and plasma levels of CRP, \u03b1\n2-macroglobulin and neopterin were within normal limits. The patients had not been treated with immunosuppressive drugs or steroids during the preceding 3 months before blood sampling.

In previous studies, an impairment of IL-2 production was predominantly described for MS patients with stable disease (Selmaj et al., 1988). Interleukin-2 is produced by activated helper T-cells and is required for appropriate lymphocyte function and proliferation (Smith, 1988). Defective production of IL-2 therefore results in an impaired T-cell response and diminished protection against viral infections. Similar findings have been reported for a variety of autoimmune diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus (Zier et al., 1984, Roncarolo et al., 1988) or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (Miyasaka et al., 1984) and also for other neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease (Kl\u00fcter et al., 1995). Interleukin-2 further acts as an endogenous brain neurokine which is able to influence central nervous functions (Haugen and Letourneau, 1990, Merrill, 1990). Interleukin-2 mRNA has recently been found to be present in human oligodendrocytes (Otero and Merrill, 1995), implicating a role for IL-2 in the development of oligodendrocytes, their MBP content and reconstitution (Benveniste and Merrill, 1986, Saneto et al., 1986, Benveniste et al., 1987).",
