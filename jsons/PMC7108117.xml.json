            "text": "Marseille, which was founded on a rocky landscape facing the sun and the sea, continues to play its role of European\u2013African\u2013Middle East gateway in the Mediterranean region. The reception and transit of diverse goods, food, and travelers, and with them microorganisms (causing plague, cholera, etc) has always been a major issue for the city. Since the 12th century, quarantine and isolation of patients has been a structuring public health issue. Marseille in 1120 used the Fort Saint-Jean as a containment area and created the first lazaret in 1526 (under Aragon Spanish Kingdom rule), then built the first hospital Hotel Dieu in 1643 and the Lazaret of Saint Martin of Arenc installed in the northern part of the city in 1814. All of these quarantine stations were situated out of town but on the coast of Marseille. In 1821, a large yellow fever outbreak in Africa reached Spain, indicating that Europe was not protected against this disease. Finally, it was on the Frioul Island, at the forefront of Marseille, that was erected in 1828 the Caroline hospital designed by the architect M. R. Penchaud (1772\u20131833), able to assure the containment of 48 patients and 24 convalescent patients. Penchaud chose this place essentially because of the main direction of the wind (mistral), expecting to dilute the presumed contagious entities (miasmas). It was first used for the quarantine of soldiers evacuated from African areas with yellow fever. It was then rehabilitated in 1850 by the health architect Jean-Marc Samuel Vaucher (1798\u20131877) to replace the Arenc Lazaret. The Caroline hospital was renamed \u201cRatonneau\u201d after the name of the island and would become the Lazaret Island, the largest quarantine station and isolation hospital of the Mediterranean region [19]. At this time, 2 theories were erected concerning contagion: that transmission was due to contact between humans, justifying quarantine; and that of Lazaret and others, who considered transmission to be due to miasmas that were carried by the air and trapped in contaminated areas. In the Caroline Hospital, the 2 theories were combined: isolation of patients and natural air circulation. Contagious patients were cared for in a specially isolated area next to the entry of the hospital, avoiding unnecessary circulation within the building, while the convalescent patients were placed next to intendancy and administration, the nurses being located in between (Figure 1A and 1B). It is particularly interesting to note that these principles of protection implemented at the time remain valid: isolation, containment, air as a vector of asepsis, and easy cleaning of the walls to evacuate the miasmas.",

A cascade of pressure and supply and exhaust HEPA filtration system ensures air quality according to technical recommendations [17, 20]. At the floor below, the risk is lower; the BSL2 laboratory space is organized on the same principle but with a lower airflow rate. On the first floor, accommodation and diagnostic laboratories are equipped with the common and mandatory means. While laboratories are located in the storefront on boulevard Jean Moulin, the bedrooms are quiet as they are located between the hospital and the faculty campus.

Influenza incidence is 2.67 times higher in double-room occupancy [7]. Single bedroom occupancy reduces airborne as well as cross-contamination of pathogens between patients [22]. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) airborne pathogens such as TB should be cared for in negative air pressure bedrooms [17]. As a consequence, infectious diseases wards in IHU have been built as a suite of concentric circles with the health care worker (HCW) at the center, around the HWC pathway, around the patients in single rooms, and surrounding the unit, a visitor corridor with access limited to the patients if not in isolation (Figure 4). In front of each bedroom are masks, gloves, and coats in patented dispenser boxes. The entrance doors of the building have been equipped with infrared cameras to detect febrile persons and guide them to a specific zone of the consultation area to be cared for, allowing for a secure isolation in a dedicated part of the outpatient clinic for quick clinical investigation and diagnostics at the POC and eventually healthcare at the level 3 floor if contagious [23] (Figure 5).
