            "text": "Initially, we focused on the possibility that Tregs would be useful in suppressing an excessive host immune response, thereby diminishing disease. We transferred bulk populations of Tregs into MHV-infected C57BL/6 or RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice and found that transferred cells improved survival, diminished the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating into the CNS and decreased the amount of demyelination (Anghelina et al., 2009, Trandem et al., 2010). The transferred Tregs likely functioned in the draining lymph nodes (cervical lymph node, CLN) because they were not detected in the infected brain. Further, dendritic cell activation and cytokine expression in the lymph nodes and brain were decreased in mice that received conventional CD4 T cells (Tconv) and Tregs compared to those that received just Tconv. In addition, depletion of Tregs prior to infection resulted in increased demyelination at later times after infection (de Aquino et al., 2013). Other studies indicated that Tregs had additional effects in the draining lymph nodes, suppressing the outgrowth of self-reactive T cells that could lead to autoimmunity. Self-reactive T cells were detected in MHV-infected mice, but their presence did not lead to autoimmune demyelination (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012, Savarin et al., 2015). Both Foxp3 Tregs and IL-10-secreting Type 1 regulatory (Tr1) cells (see below) were required for suppression of self-reactive Tconv (Savarin et al., 2016). However, Tregs functioned specifically in the CLN, such that their depletion resulted in increased cellular infiltration and inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, these results showed that bulk populations of Tregs, which presumably contained only small numbers of virus-specific Tregs, were able to ameliorate virus-induced demyelination as well as suppress self-reactive CD4 T cell numbers, largely by functioning in the CLN.",

            "text": "At the time that these initial experiments were completed, there were few if any reports of virus-specific Tregs. One might expect that these cells would be more suppressive than bulk populations of Tregs, since they would be strongly activated by signaling through the T cell receptor. As a first step to investigating this possibility, brains and spinal cords harvested from J2.2-V-1-infected mice were examined for the presence of virus-specific Tregs (Zhao et al., 2011). We identified M133-specific CD4 T cells in the MHV-infected brain, using an MHC class II/peptide M133 tetramer. Further, we showed that these cells at the site of inflammation, the brain, expressed two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF. Previous work had shown that Treg expression of T-bet was required for optimal trafficking and function of Tregs at sites of Th1 inflammation (Koch et al., 2009); our results now showed that these cells also expressed Th1 cytokines. These cells remained immunosuppressive, however, although subsequent experiments suggested that these cells might be slightly impaired in their immunosuppressive ability compared to cells not expressing these cytokines (data not shown). These cells were, at least in part, thymically derived because they could be detected in na\u00efve Foxp3-GFP+ cells (Zhao et al., 2011). It should be noted that the number of virus-specific Tregs was very small. Approximately 10% of all CD4 T cells were Tregs and of the Tregs, 5\u201310% were specific for epitopes M133 plus S358, a second, less dominant CD4 T cell epitope recognized in infected C57BL/6 mice.",

            "text": "To further investigate the importance of M133-specific Tregs, we engineered mice that transgenically expressed a T cell receptor (TCR) specific for epitope M133 (Zhao et al., 2013). These mice contained a small number of M133-specific Tregs, which could be identified by GFP expression and were useful as tracers in infected C57BL/6 mice. Mice were crossed to CD45 and CD90 (Thy1) congenic mice, so that transferred Tregs and conventional CD4 T cells (Tconv) could be identified by CD45 and/or CD90 expression, while Tregs expressed GFP (Zhao et al., 2014). Using M133-specific Tregs and Tconv in a set of adoptive transfer experiments, we first showed that M133 Tregs but not bulk populations entered the brain, consistent with previous experiments in which only bulk populations of Tregs were analyzed (Trandem et al., 2010). Second, M133 Tregs, like M133 Tconv, proliferated in the draining lymph node, although with a one day lag compared to Tconv. M133 Treg proliferation preceded cell entry into the CNS. M133 Tconv and Treg proliferation occurred primarily in the CLN and deep CLN (DCLN) and not in other peripheral lymphoid tissue, because after treatment with FTY720, which inhibits cell egress from lymph nodes, dividing cells were detected only in these lymph nodes. The transferred Tregs functioned at several steps to dampen M133 Tconv accumulation in the brain (Fig. 1\n). M133 Tregs diminished the proliferation of Tconv in the DCLN and also decreased expression of activation markers on the cells. Notably, levels of CD69 and CD25, the two activation markers that were measured, were identical on nondividing cells, demonstrating that the transferred Tregs primarily affected cells after initial activation occurred. M133 Tregs also inhibited M133 Tconv egress from the DCLN, by decreasing expression of CXCR3, required for entry into the infected CNS, on these cells. Most importantly, transferred M133 Tregs, but not bulk Tregs enhanced survival and decreased the percentage of M133 and, to a lesser extent, S358 Tconv but not virus-specific (S510-specific) CD8 T cells in the infected brain. Virus clearance was not delayed in mice that received M133 Tregs. Microglia activation, as assessed by MHC class II expression, was decreased by M133 Treg transfer. These results suggested that M133 Tregs preferentially suppressed M133 proliferation and function. To confirm this, a set of experiments were performed in vitro that confirmed preferential suppressive effects of M133 Tregs on M133 Tconv > S358 Tconv > S510 CD8 T cells. Together, these results indicated that MHV-specific Tregs were present in the draining lymph nodes and brain and functioned at both sites to suppress an excessive pro-inflammatory T cell response. Treg-mediated suppression of Tconv responding to the cognate epitope was most potent.",

            "text": "In addition to Tregs, Tr1 and IL-10-expressing CD8 T cells also play a role in controlling the pro-inflammatory T cell response. Initial studies showed that the complete absence of IL-10 increased morbidity and mortality in J2.2-V-1 infected mice. Inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine production were increased in infected mice and likely contributed to increased disease severity (Lin et al., 1998). Next, the source for IL-10 in infected mice was examined by flow cytometry (Puntambekar et al., 2011, Trandem et al., 2011b). At the peak of infection, both CD4 and CD8 T cells expressed IL-10, although expression by CD8 T cells was relatively transitory and decreased as inflammation subsided. IL-10 expression by CD4 T cells persisted even after mice recovered from acute disease. IL-10 was produced by the most activated virus-specific CD8 T cells and was postulated to serve as an autocrine \u201cbreak\u201d on a potentially hyperinflammatory T cell response (Trandem et al., 2011b). Consistent with this notion, virus was cleared more rapidly from infected brains in the absence of IL-10. Further support for the transitory nature of IL-10 production by these cells was the loss of IL-10 expression after adoptive transfer of IL-10-expressing CD8 T cells into infected hosts. Finally, transfer of IL-10+/+, but not IL-10\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells modestly reduced demyelination after transfer into J2.2-V-1-infected IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results showed an important role for CD8 T cell-expressed IL-10 in diminishing morbidity, mortality and demyelination and also suggested that IL-10 may be most important during the early stages of the infection. To address this more precisely, a recombinant version of J2.2-V-1 that expressed IL-10 (rJ2.2-IL-10) was developed and used to infected C57BL/6 and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice (Trandem et al., 2011a). Viral expression of IL-10 was maximal at day 2 after infection of C57BL/6 mice but returned to baseline by day 14. Viral expression of IL-10 delayed virus clearance modestly, but also substantially decreased the level of demyelination. Levels of cellular infiltrates, microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression were diminished in mice infected with rJ2.2-IL-10 compared to control virus. Infection of IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice with rJ2.2-IL-10 but not control virus resulted in decreased mortality, weight loss, clinical disease and demyelination with delayed kinetics of virus clearance. To extend these experiments, IL-10 was neutralized at early and late times after infection of C57BL/6 mice. IL-10 neutralization from days 1\u201311 but not days 5\u201311 after infection resulted in increased demyelination, suggesting that IL-10 was required at early times after infection, even though demyelination was not evident until later in the disease course. In addition to effects on the T cell and macrophage response, IL-10 has also been implicated in tissue repair in the CNS. Thus, in the absence of IL-10, astrocyte activation and glial scar formation, which limit ongoing demyelination, were hindered resulting in more extensive myelin destruction (Puntambekar et al., 2015). Together these results show that IL-10 is not only anti-inflammatory, modulating a potentially harmful host response and only modestly delaying virus clearance, but also affects other aspects of the resolving phase of inflammation after virus is cleared.",

            "text": "As described above, Tregs, by suppressing the immune response, may ameliorate immunopathology but also delay virus clearance. Higher numbers of Tregs are present in the brains of susceptible SJL compared to resistant C57BL/6 mice. Treatment of SJL mice with anti-CD25 antibody, which depletes or inactivates Tregs (Kohm et al., 2006), decreased clinical disease, enhanced the kinetics of virus clearance and augmented TMEV-specific CD8 T and CD4 T cell responses (Richards et al., 2011). In a complementary approach, Tregs were developed in vitro (induced Tregs, iTregs) and delivered to TMEV-infected SJL mice during either the acute or chronic phase of the infection. Treatment during the acute phase resulted in decreased virus clearance, decreased inflammation, greater weight loss and worsened clinical disease, while treatment during the chronic phase resulted in diminished demyelination. In both the acute and chronic phases of the disease, the iTegs functioned by enhancing IL-10 production (Martinez et al., 2014). In contrast, Tregs had only a small role in the immune response in resistant (C57BL/6) mice infected with TMEV. In these mice, Treg depletion resulted in increased recruitment of T cells at early times after infection, with no effects on the kinetics of virus clearance or disease outcome (Prajeeth et al., 2014). Together, these results indicate that Treg effects in TMEV-infected SJL mice were complex, since their presence at early times after infection inhibited virus clearance, which resulted in more severe demyelination and clinical disease during the chronic phase. However, treatment with exogenous Tregs during the chronic phase reduced inflammation and demyelination, suggesting that use of exogenous Tregs in this setting requires careful consideration of the phase of the infection.",

            "text": "Several studies show a correlation between IL-10 expression and improved outcomes in TMEV-infected mice. Thus, treatment of TMEV-infected SJL mice with IFN-\u03b2 or poly I:C diminished demyelination and decreased the number of autoreactive CD4 T cells. Concomitant with these changes was an increase in IL-10 expression within the CNS (Olson and Miller, 2009), consistent with a change from a Th1 to Th2 response. In another study, a TMEV variant with low pathogenesis was shown to differ from wild type TMEV by a single amino acid change in a CD4 T cell epitope. This mutation resulted in a change from a Th1 to a Th2 response, such that cells responsive to the epitope expressed IL-4 rather than IFN-\u03b3 and was driven by antigen presenting cell (APC) expression of IL-10 instead of IL-12 in infected mice (Palma et al., 2002). In another study, IL-10 produced largely by T cells was shown to be elevated in TMEV-infected SJL compared to C57BL/6 mice, and postulated to contribute to delayed virus clearance, much like Tregs did, as described above. IL-10 expression remained elevated even when Treg numbers decreased, suggesting that IL-10 was expressed later during the infection by a non-Treg T cell (Herder et al., 2012). Collectively, these results are consistent with the notion that IL-10 had similar effects as Tregs in TMEV-infected mice, decreasing the kinetics of virus clearance at early times after infection and ameliorating disease at later times. However, studies of IL-10 in the context of TMEV are all correlative and whether IL-10 actually has these postulated roles will require additional work.",

Moreover, studies of the pathogenesis of many viral infections, including those that result in myelin destruction, demonstrate an important role for the host immune response in tissue damage. In this review, we focused on two well studied examples of virus-induced demyelination. In both cases, myelin is damaged or destroyed during the process of virus clearance. Treatment with anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution factors such as regulatory T cells or IL-10 ameliorates host tissue damage but as especially evident in TMEV infections, may diminish virus clearance, resulting in more virus-induced tissue damage as well as additional targets for the host response. Of all the therapeutic modalities described above, virus-specific Tregs appear to be most useful since they preferentially down modulate virus-specific immune responses that may be pathogenic. However, adaptation of virus-specific Tregs to human disease will require substantial amounts of work. Approaches that increased Tregs in infected patients, especially those that targeted virus-specific epitopes, would be required to maximize effects on deleterious immune responses without significantly inhibiting virus clearance. Efforts at engineering such Tregs would also be useful in the setting of autoimmune disease (Berdien et al., 2014, Doudna and Charpentier, 2014, Provasi et al., 2012).",
