Our program is operationalizing Telemedicine and the ACGME is favorable to neurology residents using this unique tool to take care of patients. We now work in discrete shifts, 7 days on and 7 days off, with a goal of limiting AlGaeed 4 exposure and allowing for multiple, healthy, back-up residents in case of illness or need for quarantine. Time on the service is more intense given larger individual resident workload but manageable. End of shift handoffs are now done remotely to reduce the potential spread of infection. We have limited the number of individuals in our workspace to maintain social and physical distancing. Education certainly has been affected but we have made great effort to maintain normalcy. Cancellation of weekly in-person academic conferences is the most obvious cause of education compromise. We are leveraging web-based technologies to continue formal didactics, case conferences, and journal clubs. Structured self-learning and selfstudy with online quizzes helps to consolidate information and provide feedback. Closure of non-urgent outpatient clinics has reduced our hands-on experience in our continuity clinic and outpatient sub-specialty clinics.",
