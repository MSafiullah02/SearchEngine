Other advantages of repurposing drugs are the existence of clinical data and the availability of affordable drugs for patients. Viral infection is a major problem of morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide. Only 12 therapeutic drugs have been approved by the FDA to treat viral infections since 2013 and, among these agents, ten are used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV, one is used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) and one is used to treat influenza virus (IFV). The limitations of available agents in controlling other viral infections and the emerging resistance to antiviral drugs underline the urgent need for effective drugs to manage viral infections.",

            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) and IFV (see Glossary for full list of abbreviations) are two major respiratory pathogens causing significant morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide. CoV is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus classified in the Coronaviridae family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E). SARS and MERS have been well recognized globally owing to their outbreaks of severe infection [1]. However, the lack of effective therapeutic drugs to control SARS and MERS means that high morbidity and mortality rates have not reduced [2]. In addition to high morbidity and mortality, the emergence of new wide-host-range viral members, the potential domestic animal adaptation and the difficulty in identifying intermediate hosts are major concerns in the control of CoV infection. IFV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus associated with the Orthomyxoviridae family, consisting of IFV-A, -B and -C genera. IFV causes seasonal outbreaks of pandemic and zoonotic diseases [3]. Vaccination has been used to control epidemic IFV for decades. Antiviral agents have been developed to target IFV M2 ion channels (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidases (zanamivir and oseltamivir); however, the use of these agents results in substantial drug resistance 4, 5.",

However, the concerns of these approaches include ineffective control of viral infections and resistance of DAAs that result from mutation-associated variations and evolved new viral variants. Thus, therapeutics targeting host cellular machineries, which are essential for viral infection, are considered in developing broad-spectrum agents to overcome viral variations and drug resistance. The host-targeted antivirals (HTAs) are designed to target specific steps during viral infection, including viral binding to host cells, viral entry into host cells, viral replication and viral budding. For example, an FDA-approved CCR5 receptor antagonist maraviroc (MVC) is effective to inhibit R5-tropic HIV-1 entry into cells [6]. Treatment with the humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody ibalizuman, which blocks the entry of HIV-1 into cells by noncompetitive binding to CD4, showed that 43% and 50% of patients had a viral load <50 and 200 copies per milliliter, respectively, at week 25 [7]. However, it is unclear which side-effects result from long-term use of HTAs. In this review, we discuss the progress and challenges in the repurposing of clinically approved and preclinically promising therapeutic HTAs targeting viral entry, viral replication and innate immune responses for treating CoV and IFV infections.",

The cleavage of S involves the cysteine protease cathepsin L in the endosomal pathway or the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in a nonendosomal pathway [8]. IFV entry requires an envelope fusion with the host membrane, via viral hemagglutinin (HA), followed by the proteolytic cleavage of HA by TMPRSS11D (also HAT) to initiate endocytosis [9]. Thus, these host proteases in endosomal and nonendosomal pathways can be targeted to block viral entry into host cells [10].",

Camostat is a synthetic low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor and is used to treat human dyspepsia associated with mild pancreatic disease [13]. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 with camostat results in a 270-fold reduction of MERS-CoV production in the human bronchial submucosal gland-derived Calu-3 cells [11]. Camostat is also effective at protecting mice from a SARS-CoV infection [14]. The treatment of human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cells with camostat significantly reduces infection by IFV-A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses [15]. Nafamostat is an FDA-approved serine protease inhibitor to treat pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation 16, 17. Treatment of the human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells with nafamostat blocks MERS-CoV infection by inhibiting TMPRSS2 and results in a significant reduction of viral production [18]. The EC50 of camostat mesilate and nafamostat for IFV-A are 4.4 and 0.82 \u03bcM, respectively, in MDCK cells; and their CC50 values are >1000 and 278 \u03bcM, respectively [19], indicating that these agents are effective at controlling viral infection and safe to host cells. A recent screening of the chemical library identified bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH) as a bioavailable TMPRSS2 inhibitor [20]. Because BHH has already been approved by the FDA as an ingredient in mucolytic cough suppressants, it is likely to be developed to treat CoV and IFV infection.",

IFV also utilizes macropinocytosis as an alternative entry pathway to the acidic late-endosomal compartment 27, 28. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, is the first antipsychotic drug for treating schizophrenia 29, 30. CPZ was identified by screening FDA-approved drugs effective at inhibiting MERS-CoV replication at low micromolar levels in Huh 7 cells. CPZ inhibits MERS-CoV replication at an early and a post-entry stage, indicating its ability to inhibit the early clathrin-mediated endocytosis and other machineries [31]. CPZ also inhibits SARS-CoV and animal coronaviruses with an IC50 value of 8.8 \u03bcM in Vero cells 32, 33, 34. Treatment of caveolin-1-negative HepG2 cells with CPZ significantly reduces the entry of SARS-CoV into cells [32]. These findings indicate that CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway to enter cells. Amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is used to treat cardiovascular disease by blocking epithelial sodium channels within the distal tubule of the kidney [35]. Amiloride derivative 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) is routinely used specifically to inhibit macropinocytic endocytosis [36]. A recent report revealed that a combination of EIPA with CPZ synergistically reduces the ability of IFV-A to infect the bovine kidney MDCK cells [28], indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytic and macropinocytic pathways are used by IFV to enter cells. Thus, combining complementary agents needs to be further developed to achieve an effective control of viral entry into host cells.",

Blocking v-ATPase activity interferes with viral infection by preventing the pH-dependent membrane fusion of viral envelops with the endosomal membrane. Saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) is an anticancer compound capable of inhibiting v-ATPase [39]. SaliPhe inhibits acidification of endosomes and reduces production of progeny viruses at IC50 values of 0.03 and 0.08 \u03bcM in IFV-A-infected MDCK and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells, respectively 38, 40. Administrating mice with 7 mg/kg SaliPhe three-times daily for 8 days resulted in a 62.5% survival rate from lethal IFV infection, and mice recovered by 15 days [38]. Packing SaliPhe with nanoparticles enhances the in vitro stability and antiviral activity with low cytotoxicity [41]. Diphyllin, a natural compound isolated from Cleistanthus collinus, has been identified as a novel v-ATPase inhibitor [42]. Diphyllin inhibits endosomal acidification in human osteoclasts and reduces v-ATPase expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells [43]. Diphyllin has been shown to effectively inhibit IFV infection in MDCK cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.63 \u03bcM [44]. Diphyllin also effectively inhibits the clinically isolated oseltamivir-resistant IFV-A/San Diego/21/2008 (H1N1) strain, which carries a drug-resistant mutation (H275Y) in the NA gene, and the amantadine-resistant A/PR/8/34 strain [44]. Diphyllin is well tolerated in mice [43]. Delivery of diphyllin by nanoparticles increases its antiviral effects on feline CoV and it is also well tolerated in mice [45]. Niclosamide, a salicylanilide, has been used to treat parasitic helminthic infestations in humans for >40 years [46]. Niclosamide acts as a proton carrier to target acidic endosomes and to neutralize the pH of coated vesicles or synthetic liposomes [47]. Niclosamide effectively inhibits IFV-A in A549 cells [47] and pH-dependent SARS-CoV infection [48]. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, is used clinically to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias [49]. Amiodarone inhibits SARS-CoV infection at a post-endosomal stage, and the pretreatment with amiodarone results in a 10 000-fold reduction of viral production in Vero cells [50].",

The inhibition of the nonendosomal TMPRSS2 by camostat or nafamostat does result in suppression of CoV infection, but inhibition of the endosomal cathepsin by K11777 does not. Thus, TMPRSS2, but not cathepsins, is a promising target for antiviral therapeutic development. Camostat and nafamostat are FDA-approved drugs. Camostat has been shown to exhibit a potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, it is logical to further determine the efficacy of camostat in the control of CoV and IFV in clinical studies.

Imatinib, an FDA-approved agent, inhibits CoV fusion with the endosomal membrane in vitro\n2, 54; thus, the in vivo efficacy of imatinib in the control of viral infection needs to be determined in an animal model. Treatment of animals with the v-ATPase inhibitors SaliPhe or diphyllin reduces acidification and suppresses viral infection; and packing with nanoparticles helps to increase the efficacy of these inhibitors in controlling viral infection with tolerable adverse effects in animals.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) dehydrogenizes dihydroorotate to orotic acid, a key step in biosynthesis of de novo pyrimidine to generate uracil, which binds with a ribose sugar to form the ribonucleoside uridine for transcription [56]. The DHODH inhibitors teriflunomide (or its prodrug leflunomide) and brequinar are used as immunosuppressive agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis patients [57]. Although these agents showed an ability to inhibit de novo pyrimidine synthesis that contributes to their broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro, their antiviral activity is ineffective in vivo, resulting from exogenously provided uridine and bypassing the inhibited biosynthesis of pyrimidine to sustain viral replication 58, 59. Recent studies showed the small-molecule GSK983 was capable of inhibiting DHODH and effective in blocking replication of various viruses and arresting cell growth 60, 61. Supplying exogenous deoxycytidine to sustain cellular DNA synthesis, but not RNA, results in reducing GSK983 cytotoxicity without reducing GSK983-mediated inhibition of dengue virus (DENV) replication [61]. Thus, the combined use of deoxycytidine with GSK983 provides an intriguing strategy with reduced cytotoxicity to safely use DHODH inhibitors in controlling RNA viruses.",

CoV uses cap-independent cis-acting RNA internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements with eIF4A for viral translation that can also be inhibited by silvestrol [83]. Interestingly, silvestrol exhibits a potent and modest ability to inhibit IFV-A infection in A549 cells and MDCK cells, respectively, but fails to inhibit viral infection in Vero cells [84]. The antiviral effect of silvestrol on IFV infection is reversible, where drug withdrawal results in rapid dissolution of stalled preinitiation complexes (stress granules) and resumption of viral protein synthesis. Inhibition of IFV-A by silvestrol is associated with cytotoxicity [84]. By contrast, pateamine A irreversibly binds to eIF4A to result in an extended blockade of IFV-A replication after drug withdrawal, and it inhibits IFV-A replication in all A549, MDCK and Vero cells with minimal cytotoxicity [84]. These findings indicate the eIF4A is a promising target for therapeutic development to inhibit viral translation and replication by agents, such as silvestrol and pateamine A.",

Treatment of cells with U0126 significantly reduces the replication of IFV-A, and nasal administration of U0126 protects mice from a lethal infection with IFV-A without developing any adverse effects [92]. Treatment of H1N1-infected mice with the Mek inhibitor CI-1040 reduces 80% viral production in the lung [93]; however, the low bioavailability of CI-1040 needs improving for it to be an effective antiviral agent [94]. The Mek1/2 inhibitor trametinib and the Erk1/2 inhibitor selumetinib, which are FDA-approved anticancer agents, can effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection [85]. Trametinib also inhibits replication of various IFV strains (FPV/H7N7, SC35M/H7N7, PR8M/H1N1) in vitro and in vivo by interfering with the export of progeny vRNPs from the nucleus. Pretreatment with trametinib (EC50\n = 0.016 \u03bcM) blocks IFV-induced cytopathogenic effect and decreases viral production in A549 cells. Oral administration of 0.1 mg/kg trametinib to mice daily is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis 95, 96, and oral administration of 3 mg/kg trametinib daily for five consecutive days reduces IFV production [97].

            "text": "IFV-A and SARS-CoV infection induce inflammation in vivo\n117, 118. Activation of NF-\u03baB is a hallmark for detecting viral infections [119]. NF-\u03baB plays an important part in the regulation of genes involved in the inflammation counteracting viral infection [119]. However, IFV-A can take advantage of NF-\u03baB activation, via the degradation of I\u03baB, for viral replication [119]. Thus, NF-\u03baB could be targetable for interfering with IFV replication [120]. Saikosaponin A (SSa), a lipophilic triterpene saponin derived from Radix Bupleurum, has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties 121, 122. SSa inhibits NF-\u03baB activation and effectively attenuates IFV-A replication at IC50 values of 1.55, 1.62 and 1.73 \u03bcg/ml for H1N1, H5N1 and H9N2 strains, respectively, in A549 cells. Daily subcutaneous injection with SSa at 50 mg/kg for six consecutive days beginning at 4 h post-infection protects mice from a lethal infection of IFV-A [123]. Treatment of mice with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and/or parthenolide reduces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung and significantly increases animal survival (\u223c17% to \u223c33\u201356%) from SARS-CoV infection [124]. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341), an anticancer drug, suppresses I\u03baB degradation to result in blocking NF-\u03baB activation 125, 126. It was shown that PS-341 at a noncytotoxic level of 0.05 \u03bcM can reduce IFV-A replication (up to three orders of magnitude) in A549 cells; however, 0.1 \u03bcM PS-341 becomes cytotoxic [127]. Thus, concerning the antiviral activity of PS-341 in association with cytotoxicity, PS-341-associated adverse effects need to be carefully determined for developing an optimal antiviral agent. In addition, stronger neo-Minophagen C (SNMC), a glycyrrhizin preparation, has been approved in Japan to treat chronic hepatic diseases [128]. Glycyrrhizin is an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiviral agent 129, 130. Glycyrrhizin suppresses IFV-A replication, in part through interference with virus-induced proinflammatory gene expression [131]. Glycyrrhizin can suppress SARS-CoV infection at the early entry and the late replication stages in Vero cells with an EC50 value of 300 \u03bcg/ml [132]. Andrographis paniculata is an anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, antibacterial and hepatoprotective agent [133], and the major component 14-deoxy-11,12-dehydroandrographolide (DAP) suppressed gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as IFV-A replication 134, 135. These results suggest that anti-inflammatory agents could be further developed for the therapeutic control of IFV-A and SARS-CoV infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide is a safe drug for treating intestinal infection by Cryptosporidium parvum\n136, 137. Nitazoxanide is currently undergoing studies to control viral infections. Nitazoxanide can interfere with post-translational modification of IFV hemagglutinin in human and animal cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 \u03bcg/ml, and nitazoxanide is reportedly effective in controlling IFV-A and -B infection in a Phase III clinical study [138]. Nitazoxanide has also been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV infection of mice and LLC-MK2 cells with an IC50 value of 0.92 \u03bcg/ml by suppressing expression of the viral N protein and proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [139]. Accordingly, nitazoxanide is regarded highly as a promising antiviral agent repurposed from an antiparasitic agent.",

Recent development of antiviral agents in modulating host immune responses has substantially advanced the fields of virology and pharmaceutics, as well as significantly contributed to healthcare advances in humans and animals. NSC61610 and LPG have been shown to effectively control IFV-A infection in animals by activating the immune response. These agents should be considered in clinical trials for treating viral infection. By contrast, SSa, CAPE, glycyrrhizin and DAP are undergoing in vitro and in vivo studies to reveal their ability to control viral infection. However, adverse effects of these immune-modulating agents need to be seriously clarified.",

Approximately one-in-ten new promising preclinical drugs, identified from hundreds of compounds, might be approved for clinical use. Approximately 30% of new drugs fail to pass safety protocols in clinical trials. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is a time-efficient, cost-effective and safe approach to developing therapeutic drugs for the new indication of treating viral infection. To repurpose an FDA-approved drug, such as anticancer and other agents, researchers still need to go through in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies to determine the value of a candidate drug for treating IFV and/or CoV diseases. In vitro studies can identify viral strains to be targeted, determine the host cell range susceptible to viral infection and reveal additional molecular targets specifically for controlling viral infection. The value of host molecular targets can be evaluated by gene knockdown, knockout or mutation via the methods of RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas9. In vivo studies will determine the maximal tolerable doses and adverse effects, efficacy in controlling viral infection and pharmacokinetics of drug concentrations in the plasma to reestablish an effective and safe regimen and protocol for treating IFV and/or CoV diseases. The new in vitro and in vivo results will be considered with existing data together to design clinical studies for viral diseases.",

In general, viral infection is an acute pathogenesis that can require higher doses of a repurposed drug than doses used in treating originally targeted chronic diseases for an optimal outcome. Thus, the administration route and toxicity of a repurposed drug need to be carefully determined. Viral infection also results in changes in not only the host\u2019s immune system but also the function of the host\u2019s organs, which could interfere with pharmacological effects of a repurposed drug or cause additional side effects. Thus, it will be beneficial to study combination therapies capable of targeting viral components, modulating cellular machineries and alleviating adverse effects to achieve optimal outcomes of increased antiviral efficacy, reduced viral resistance and minimized toxicity and side effects.",

CoV entry into cells relies on either a nonendosomal pathway or the endosomal pathway involving the host protease TMPRSS2 or the host adapter protein clathrin, respectively. IFV entry utilizes the endosomal pathway or the macropinocytic pathway. These pathways render the release of vRNA into the cytoplasm, followed by importing vRNA into the nucleus for viral replication. The host protein kinases Raf, Mek, Erk and CDKs have important roles in regulation of transcription and translation at various stages of viral replication. CoV and IFV utilize the host eIF-involved cap-dependent translational machinery to produce viral proteins. Activation of the host protein kinases PKR, PERK, HRI and GCN2 can phosphorylate the eIF2\u03b1 to attenuate translation. Assembly of viral particles requires the host TMPRSS2 for cleavage of CoV spike and IFV HA in the Golgi apparatus to produce viral progeny to be released by budding. In addition, the NF-\u03baB pathway is activated through inactivation of I\u03baBa to induce proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFNs, for innate immune response to viral infection. These host-based pathways are targetable by repurposed agents to control viral infection. Representative repurposed drugs have a pink background. Green thick arrows indicate induction. Green thick stop signs indicate inhibition. Scissor signs indicate proteolytic cleavage.",
