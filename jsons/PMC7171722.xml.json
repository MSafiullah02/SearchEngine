This proteolytic cleavage generates three polypeptides, in which C- and N-terminal (F1 and F2 subunits) polypeptides are linked by two disulfide bonds.11\n34 The active form of the F protein in the viral particles is a trimer in a prefusion conformation.35 This protein mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane by changing its conformation to a postfusion form after interacting with the receptor.36 Importantly, the F protein can interact with different proteins on the surface of host cells, such as TLR4,37 ICAM-1,38 and nucleolin.39 Particularly, nucleolin has been described as the main hRSV receptor that interacts with the F protein, because it was shown that nonpermissive cells expressing nucleolin became susceptible to hRSV infection.39 Furthermore, no new virions could be made after infection with a mutant virus lacking this protein.40 These data suggest that the F protein is one of the most important hRSV proteins contributing to infection and interaction with host cells.",

Likely, this interaction allows a proper approach between the F protein and nucleolin.32 In addition, the G protein exists also as a secreted form, which has been shown to be important for capturing antibodies generated by the host against this protein. This soluble form prevents the opsonization and neutralization of the virus by G-specific antibodies.43 Furthermore, another important feature of this protein is the capacity to impair the function of chemokines and cytokines due to a CX3C chemokine-like motif that can mimic and compete with these molecules for the interaction with their receptors and, thus, modulate CD8+ T-cell responses.44\n45 Moreover, the G protein was shown to display structural homology with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and is likely to interact with TNF family cytokine members, conducting to a misbalance in the inflammatory response mediated by these molecules.46 Although G protein is not totally necessary for hRSV infection, it plays an important role at modulating the immune response triggered by hRSV infection.",

During the first hours after infection, the N protein has been shown to associate within these structures with MDA5 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), which contribute to the innate immune response.57 The sequestering of these molecules by the N protein would cause a poor detection of viral genome by these nucleic acid sensors, which could dampen the antivirus interferon (IFN) response.57 Importantly, it has been recently described that the N protein can be expressed on the surface of infected epithelial and dendritic cells (DCs).58 Expression of this protein impairs the capacity of hRSV-infected DCs to activate T cells, probably due to a blockade of the interaction of peptide-MHC (pMHC; MHC, major histocompatibility complex) complexes with the T-cell receptor (TCR).58 Such novel role for the N protein has provided new insights relative to the localization of this protein and how hRSV can interfere with the induction of protective T-cell responses, which is often impaired by hRSV infection.3\n19\n58\n",

It also arrests the G1 and G2/M phases in human bronchial epithelial cells.72 These actions, which are p53-dependent, increase hRSV replication.72 In addition, the M protein is directly related to the maturation of viral filaments.73 In this line, it has been described that hRSV strains that are null for the M protein show significantly lesser infective progeny particles.73 Moreover, not only lesser new viral particles are generated but also protein trafficking is affected, particularly with the N protein being concentrated in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, before virus budding. This phenomenon suggests that M protein is important for triggering the trafficking of viral proteins to the budding site.73 Other studies show that the M protein is expressed in inclusion bodies and interact with the M2\u20131 protein, as a means to interact with the RNP complex.74 The M protein is also capable of inhibiting viral transcription and interact with hRSV G and F proteins to signal the assembly of the virions.75\n76\n",

Here, the nucleocapsid is dissociated from the RNP complex and repetitions of the M protein, which is mediated by the phosphorylation of the P protein (Fig. 2).94 Importantly, this process is mediated not only by viral proteins but also by host cell enzymes, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) \u03b2 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).94 The transcription process mediated by the function of L protein mainly occurs in cellular inclusion bodies together with N and P proteins.95 As mentioned earlier, the L proteins associated with the P protein are able to recognize the promotor region on the 3\u2032 of viral RNA, and initiate transcription of viral genes.59\n67 The polymerase initiates transcription in gene start (GS) regions carrying out mRNA capping and methylating the 5\u2032 of the messenger.59\n67 Then, the L polymerase recognizes a gene end signal at the end of the mRNA and carries out polyadenylation.59\n67 This process goes on again after recognition of a new GS sequence downstream of a previously transcribed gene. It is known that the minimal proteins required for transcription are N, P, and L. The M2\u20131 protein also appears to be important because of its ability to interact with all RNP proteins,78\n79\n80\n81 included with the M protein.74 Furthermore, host proteins are also involved in the transcription process; for instance, profilin, an actin-modulatory protein, is required for an optimal transcription.96 Additionally, host heat shock proteins (HSPs) are also involved in this process, particularly HSP90 and HSP70. Both proteins are expressed in lipid rafts and are associated with the viral RNP complex. Recently, it was described that HSP90 is critical for the stability and functionality of the L polymerase and that HSP70 is necessary for efficient RNA synthesis.97\n98 When the viral genome is replicated, the L polymerase recognizes the TrC promoter region at the 3\u2032 of the antigenome and generates genomic hRSV-RNA.99 This new RNA strand is immediately encapsulated by the N protein.59\n",

In its place, hRSV budding is controlled by the RAB11 family interacting protein 2 (FIP2),105 which has been described as a novel pathway for this type of process. Taken together, the hRSV-infective cycle depends of three main processes: (1) hRSV protein localization, where inclusion bodies and rich cholesterol sites are principal places where the hRSV proteins can be founded; (2) hRSV protein interaction, the particular interaction between RNP complex and accessory proteins for replication and transcription and the interaction of M protein to surface protein triggering the virion budding; and (3) interaction of host cell proteins with hRSV proteins and structures, principally how host cells help in the release of nucleocapsid at the beginning of the process and how a novel process of budding depends of host proteins (Fig. 2).",

This impairment of immunological synapse assembly also causes improper TCR engagement, leading to the failure of antigen-specific T cells priming.3 Interestingly, these authors reported that DC-derived soluble factor mediators were not involved in this suppression.3 By contrast, alteration of cytokine secretion surrounding the DC-T cell environment by hRSV have been shown to modulate T cell response.139 Furthermore, hRSV has also been observed to alter the quantity of surface cognate peptide-MHC, impairing T cell activation.140 Likewise, secretion of Th1-like cytokines is reduced in hRSV-infected DCs and may decrease cytotoxic T cell activity.3 Taken together, immunological synapse is a fine system that could be exploited by hRSV at multiple levels. Thereafter, further research is needed to elicit mechanisms of hRSV to interfere in the immunological synapse.",

In this study, hRSV-infected rats showed a gradual increase in proteinuria and alterations in tubular epithelial cells with slight inflammatory cell infiltration in the renal interstitium. Also, both hRSV-RNA and viral titers were detected in the renal tissue with a peak at 8 days postinfection.

For instance, IL-6, IL-8, and nitrogen oxide are increased in the CSFs of hRSV-infected patients, thereby suggesting that a cytokine storm may be involved in the pathogenesis of hRSV encephalopathy (Fig. 5 and Table 1).163\n166\n167 Indeed, increased protein levels, cell infiltration, and low glucose levels have been observed in the CSF of hRSV-infected patients.26 Interestingly, CSF abnormalities have also been detected in infants with no apparent neurological symptoms, suggesting that hRSV can induce subclinical neurological alterations.168 Furthermore, brain imaging of patients with acute hRSV encephalopathy is also unclear.

Studies performed in BALB/c mice and Sprague Dawley rats have detected hRSV-RNA and viral proteins in the brain of animals previously infected intranasally with this pathogen.174 Studies have found that immune cells are associated with hRSV in peripheral blood from hRSV-infected patients. Consistent with this notion, hRSV-infected immune cells would migrate to the CNS by the hematogenous pathway and trespass the blood\u2013brain barrier.174 An unexpected and important finding regarding the access of hRSV to the CNS was the description that impairment in cognitive function is observed after pulmonary disease was resolved in mice and rats.174 Indeed, our group recently described that mice and rats infected with hRSV have a deficient performance in tests that evaluate these abilities. hRSV-infected mice performed significantly worse than noninfected mice, both in the Marble Burying (MB) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests, several weeks after viral challenge.174 The MB test consists in measuring the ability of rodents to dig and hide marbles, which is controlled by hippocampal function.175 In addition, the MWM evaluates the animal's ability for spatial learning through spatial localization of relevant visual cues that are subsequently processed, consolidated, retained, and then retrieved in the brain to successfully navigate and thereby locate a hidden platform to escape from the water.176 In both tasks, hRSV-infected animals showed significant alterations in behavioral and learning processes, as compared with control animals. Moreover, electrophysiological assays suggested that impaired cognitive function was due to a failure to efficiently induce long-term potentiation responses in the stratum radiatum in the hippocampus area. Our study supports the previously proposed idea that hRSV can alter CNS function. Accordingly, hRSV has been shown to infect primary neuronal cells in vitro, as well as neural processes innervating the lungs.148\n",
