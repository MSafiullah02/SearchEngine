Zoonoses constitute 60.3% of human EIDs of which 71.8% originate in a wildlife source with intermediate animal hosts often necessary (Jones et al. 2008). Following (Haydon et al. 2002), we define target species as those species receiving the bulk of sanitary surveillance: human and domestic species as well as a few wildlife flagship species. The sum of these target species represents a tiny fraction of biodiversity. The bias induced by this focused surveillance hides the majority of EIDs events in the non-target species.",

In tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems, the degree of wildlife/livestock/human interface and biodiversity are high and offer numerous potential events of spill-over. However, low animal and human health surveillance decrease the detection probability. In ecosystems with artificially high host densities, less inter-species transmission events occur because of the physical and sanitary protection of these systems. Moreover, efficient surveillance systems in target species increase the detection probability of the emergence. This analysis could explain the global EID patterns observed.",

Step 1 requires focusing on the wildlife/livestock/human interface, which necessitates ecological, epidemiolo\u00adgical as well as socio-economical information. This interface is characterised by: (a) multi-host systems; (b) managed and unmanaged animal populations (\u201cmanaged\u201d referring to the state of animal population when influenced by voluntary human intervention); (c) natural and modified habitats; (d) remote areas, where basic commodities are often lacking; (e) unknown socio-economical system in marginalised human communities. The lack of baseline information which characterises these interfaces combined with the above particularities requires the development of theoretical and technological tools adapted to the study of EIDs in their hotspots (Morgan et al. 2006). However, studying EIDs in selected ecosystems raises any of the following challenges: (a) looking for a still unknown pathogen; (b) arriving after the emergence process, when one does not know if the spill-over process still occurs; (c) looking for a pathogen which is not yet in the study site. In order to overcome this dilemma, a shift from a pathogen-centred to a process-centred approach is necessary. The process at stake is the pathogen spill-over in multi-hosts system at the wildlife/livestock/human interface.",

In one host population, prevalence and incidence of the pathogen measured by serological or viral detection techniques can be used to calculate the transmission rate. Common index of this transmission rate are the R0 and \u03b2 index and the force of infection (McCallum et al. 2001; see Real and Biek 2007 for a recent discussion of these parameters for wildlife zoonosis). These parameters are defined for a given pathogen in a defined host population. The data needed to estimate these parameters are the contact rate between hosts, the transmission probability resulting from these contacts and the infectiveness of the pathogen in the target host or the probability that such a contact occurs between an infected and a susceptible host (McCallum et al. 2001). Models of a shared pathogen between two host populations have been developed (see Tompkins et al. 2002 for some examples).",

            "text": "In an experimental situation using a domestic species, these parameters are accessible. A posteriori, after an outbreak, these parameters can be estimated if the relevant data has been timely collected. This data concerns repeated data collection on a pre-determined sample of the animal population and the setting-up of the appropriate environment in which the samples will be adequately stored until laboratory testing. Applied to the wildlife/livestock interface, estimating these parameters is difficult in free-ranging species (Morgan et al. 2006). Capture of wild species is often expensive, implemented in extreme conditions not suitable for sample conservation and unrealistic when the activity needs to be repeated in time on the same animals. Real and Biek (2007) suggest a possible framework using telemetry (radio and satellite) on wild species combined with sampling survey on wild and domestic species. However they identify limits such as the underestimation of the quantity of contacts if the entire wild population is not marked. Richomme et al. (2006) estimated by direct observations the contact rate and exposure between a domestic ungulate and a wild mountain ungulate and discuss additional limits of such data for the inference of EIs because of the nocturnal behaviour of wild species which cannot be apprehended. The necessity to include in the study the respective sensibi\u00adlity of each species to the pathogen requires also an extrapolation from available data on closely-related species. The role of modelling has been and will be crucial in the estimation of the behaviour of transmission parameters and their interpretation (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009). A model allows playing with variables to estimate outcomes impossible to observe in the field. They use the available data to test hypotheses which would be too complex or too costly to test in experimental conditions. Multi-host models have been developed under the form of meta-population pathogen diffusion process in the particular case of multi-host meta-population (Arino et al. 2005). Recently, transmission models of multi-strains with differential transmission pathways (with emphasis on the role of the environment) paved the way for multi-pathogen models (Roche and Rohani 2010). However, the integration of multi-host and multi-pathogen models has yet to be done. This step will be necessary in order to encompass the full complexity of the ecology of infectious disease transmission at the wildlife/domestic interface.",

There is not an infinite opportunities for a pathogen to be transmitted between two host populations and new pathogens will use routes already used by other pathogens with a higher probability. Identifying common pathways between host populations will therefore increase the knowledge about future probable emergence pathways in this system. This pathogen approach does not refer to a specific pathogen and focuses on the hosts\u2019 direct and indirect contacts but only the ones resulting in pathogen transmission. The utility of such an approach is obvious in the surveillance of EIDs in a hotspot: with an EI network, one can assess the probability of future spill-over processes between specific populations and target surveillance and/or control.

In that case, they should target closely related pathogens or some with similar behaviour (transmission pathways, host range) in order to delineate a more specific EI network. This step can be done by creating a sub-network with the selected pathogens or by weighting the influence of some pathogens in the network. Other a priori conditions could be a research question targeting a type of emerging pathogen to look for (e.g., haemorrhagic fevers). For example, several authors have argued that future EIDs will concern in majority RNA virus-type pathogens, due to inherent viral characteristics such as high mutation rate (Poss et al. 2002; Holmes and Rambaut 2004; Cleaveland et al. 2007). The design of a research framework focusing on emerging RNA viruses will select pathogens with similar mode of transmission (other RNA viruses for example) which should use the same EIs. This could be done by focusing the EI network with information from parasites phylogenetically related to the potentially emerging parasite of interest (e.g., separating viruses, bacteria, macroparasites, etc.) and/or sharing the same mode(s) of transmission. The later seems to bear more power than the former, but this will need to be tested. This approach is process orientated and the modes of transmission of parasite will be crucial in determining the transmission pathways between host populations. Groups of parasite with direct, environmental or vector-born transmission could a priori produce different EI networks. Three outcomes could emerge from empirical data:\neach EI network is specific for each parasite species and the EI network approach is somehow uselessthey are functional groups of parasite sharing a similar EI network (e.g., based on their modes of transmission)EI network are general and produce a transmission framework for all parasite species given that the network is fed with data from enough parasite species.\n",

Each parasite species is in struggle with the host immunity system and in ecological interaction (direct e.g., competition, synergy or indirect through the host immune system) with the other parasites. The community of parasites in the ecosystem will have its own ecological interactions defined by host and parasite presence and densities (Atmar and Patterson 1993; Booth and Dunne 2004). Despite some interesting recent results (Graham 2008; Jolles et al. 2008), co-infections of parasites in host populations have not been much explored. The patterns of co- occurrence or exclusion between parasites in hosts are de facto included in EI networks and will not create issues for their interpretation. Developing EI network will provide more information on parasite interaction in hosts.",

Here, \u201crecently\u201d refers to a period of time during which host populations did not have time to exchange most of their parasite species. Evolutionary processes should be close to equilibrium in co-evolved host-pathogen interaction (e.g. for Low Pathogenic Influenza viruses and waterfowl, Webster et al. 1992) and the EI network identified quite robust. As time since hosts have been in contact increases, potential transmission events with low probability will statistically increase. In the EID hotspots considered, the time since first contact between a target and a non-target population should be small: human and great apes due to hunting or tourism; livestock and wild ungulates in pristine areas recently colonised; intensive poultry production units recently installed in proximity of wetlands used by wild birds. In EIDs hotspots, by definition, (human-induced) changes disturb ecological interactions in communities. In this context, the EI identified could be instable (Altizer et al. 2003; Thomson 2005) and prone to change leading to an evolving EI network. In this context, the a priori approach, using host movements and contacts could be used. The a posteriori approach will be more difficult to implement in extremely recent interface. However, a few years should be enough for the shared community of parasites to reach a relative equilibrium.",

As mentioned already microparasites are fast evolving organisms compared to their hosts (Poss et al. 2002; Holmes and Rambaut 2004). This can be useful in tracking the origin of infection between different populations, capturing the history of spill-over process at a fine scale. A phylogenetic tree of the parasites strains detected in different host populations could bring information on the directionality of some EI and indicates rodent species as source or reservoir for the rest of host community (for an example see Cottam et al. 2008). Secondly, data from the host population, as presented previously, such as home range or telemetry data could be included to incorporate potential direct and indirect contact between host populations and related to EI identified in the pathogen approach. This would combine the host and pathogen approaches.",

Epidemiological data on various pathogens are integrated in a network to predict the behaviour of EIDs, in particular before the emergence event. The need for this approach comes from an empirical point of view, from experiences in areas of limited resources (financial and available data) and tries to answer practical questions of surveillance and control of EIDs where we know that they have a high probability to happen (EID hot spots). The scale of study \u2013 the community level \u2013 is extremely complex but we suggest that we could benefit from this scale in a resource limited environment.",

The inclusion of the epidemiology of several pathogens in the analysis should explore the results of shared prevalence or strains in relation to the specific modes of transmission.
