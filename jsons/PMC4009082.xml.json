Injuries are one of the most common of these problems. Another medical problem which could be a reason for athletes\u2019 training abstinence is infection. Certain circumstances in sport may increase the susceptibility of athletes to infectious diseases. On the other hand, athletes with infectious diseases may be at risk for severe complications if they continue their physical activity. Finally they may have transmittable diseases, so other people including sports competitors, trainers and even audiences could be at risk. Transmission of infectious diseases in sports usually occurs via direct contacts, fecal oral routs, common source exposure and airborne or droplets [1, 2].",

These risks are high especially during 1-2 weeks after heavy training [6]. In a marathon, 33.3% of athletes who ended the marathon got an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) during the first two weeks [7]. There are two theories regarding sports and the immune system. Some experts hypothesized a J-shaped relationship between physical activity and respiratory tract infection. According to this theory, regular, moderate activity strengthens the immune system and decreases rate of viral infection. While severe, prolonged activity (including marathon) has a transient inhibitory effect on immune system which may predispose athletes to URI and malignancy[8]. According to the second theory, immune system function is suppressed for at least several hours after intensive exercise, this time is an \u201copen window\u201d and the risk of infections may be increased in this period[5]. However, despite these attractive theories, there are a few studies which evaluate the effect of exercise on different parts of immune system [5, 6, 9].",

Physical activity may also influence the filtering system of respiratory tract.

Higher incidence (>four times annually) of URI in athletes is not a fact but it is observed in a lot of studies [13\u201316]. It is more prevalent in athletes with heavy exercise comparing with those with moderate to low activity [12, 16]. Different families of viruses cause URI including rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial, Para influenza and Influenza. Close contact with infected patients is the main way of transmission. Transmission through aerosols has been approved for rhinoviruses and influenza [17]. Higher prevalence of common cold in high contact sports including wrestling is predictable. Water sports such as swimming, predispose athletes to sinusitis, otitis and conjunctivitis. Due to different etiologies, clinical syndrome is different and could be presented as rino-sinusitis, bronchitis, flu-like or croup. Upper respiratory infection is self limited and most patients recover within 3 to 5 days with or without symptomatic treatment. Basic hygiene practices and limiting exposure to infected persons are important in the prevention of URI [2].",

Sedative antihistamines are forbidden by International Olympic committee (IOC) in shooters. In swimmers with Grommets, polymixin B plus neomycin and hydrocortisone (PBNH) two drops after swimming, may decrease rate of otorrhea.

Athletes with external otitis need local treatment with PBNH or ciprofloxacin. New quinolones (gattyfloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are drugs of choice for conjunctivitis and duration of treatment is seven to ten days. Acute bronchitis should be treated with NSAIDs and bronchodilators. Antibiotics have no effect on acute bronchitis and are not recommended. Although, in patients with persistent signs and symptoms for more than seven days and/or in final weeks of a preparation for a major competition, empiric therapy with antibiotics could be useful. Athletes with acute pneumonia need emergent empiric antibiotic therapy. Macrolides (Azithromycin or Clarithromycin) are drugs of choice in young adults with no morbidity. Doxycycline is an alternative agent, but photosensitivity in athletes with outdoor sports is a considerable side effect.",

It is milder and usually lasting five days. Duration of treatment in recurrent infection is five days [9]. Benzoyl peroxide and warm wind flow cause faster drying of the lesions. Periodic screening of athletes for skin lesions is recommended for prevention of disease. Valacyclovir in athletes with a past history of herpes gladiatorum could decrease risk of recurrence in sports tournaments.

Globally speaking, in case the infected person is asymptomatic and unaware of his/ her condition, hepatitis A and E are usually carried from person-to-person. The outbreak of enteric viral hepatitis has been mostly witnessed in off-the-field activities. Hepatitis B, C and G viruses are blood borne pathogens. Of the various circumstances required for the spread of blood-borne viral hepatitis, bleeding lacerations or oxidative skin lesions in the infected athlete can be mentioned. Additionally, suffering from a skin lesion or exposed mucous membrane as a portal of entry, there must be a vulnerable athlete who is in a sustained contact with the source individual. Athletes involved in sports in which there is close body contact with others, namely wrestlers and boxers are more susceptible to get infected than those who are at moderate risk of blood borne pathogen transmission such as, players of soccer, basketball and judo. Two major ways through which these blood borne pathogens are transmitted to athletes are utilization of common contaminated syringes for drug injection as well as bleeding wounds during sports enjoying close contact [30]. People who are sexually active and are keen on getting tattoos as well as those sharing personal belongings of one another are also at the high risk of getting infected [33]. Horizontal transmission of hepatitis B in contact sports is an issue to which health care professionals should also pay careful attention [34].",
