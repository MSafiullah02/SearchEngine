The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins.

This study determined that TW2575/98vac has higher replication efficiency than TW2575/98w in chicken embryo inoculated with lower titer (1 EID 50 ) of virus inoculation (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).

To clarify the difference from our observations, we used 3 different virus concentrations to inoculate chicken embryos in another experiment (Table 2) . At the higher virus inoculation concentration (10 4.7 EID 50 /0.1 ml), we had similar findings like ArkDPI and Mass with no statistical difference between TW2575/98vac and TW2575/98w.

Therefore, the difference in replication efficiency between wild and vaccine IBV strains in chicken embryos could be observed when the virus inoculation concentration was decreased to a lower level.

Two of the other attenuated IBVs, the ArkDPI vaccine [25] and QX-like nephropathogenic vaccine [7] have been developed after continuous passages in chicken embryos. The decline in virulence of the wild ArkDPI and QX-like viruses for chickens could be observed gradually and became significantly after the 51st and 58th passages, respectively.

The data from 30 amino acid substitutions found in specific TW2575/98w passages are listed in Table 5 . Nine amino acid substitutions that appear in the 69th and 77th specific passages may be potential candidates contributing to successful TW2575/98w to TW2575/98vac attenuation.
