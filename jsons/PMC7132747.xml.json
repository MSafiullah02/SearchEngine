            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory viruses (RVs) are the most common infections attended in hospitals and primary care centers. They can range from mild self-limiting illness to severe disease, the latter particularly in pediatric and severely immunosuppressed patients (Ison and Hayden, 2002, Valli\u00e8res and Renaud, 2013). A great diversity of RVs produces clinically indistinguishable symptoms; thus, laboratory diagnosis based on the simultaneous detection of multiple targets has become the best option for etiological diagnosis. Molecular methods are being increasingly used for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections due to their fine sensitivity, specificity, and timely turnover and are progressively replacing conventional methods (Caliendo, 2011). The decision to choose one or other molecular system is complex and requires systematic and comparative evaluations. In this context, the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Austin, TX, USA) has been extensively evaluated in recent years, and comparative studies have been also published showing high reliability for detection of 19 RVs in different clinical settings (Babady et al., 2012, Dabisch-Ruthe et al., 2012, Gadsby et al., 2010, Hwang et al., 2014, Jokela et al., 2012, Krunic et al., 2007, Merante et al., 2007, Pabbaraju et al., 2008, Pabbaraju et al., 2011, Pillet et al., 2013, Popowitch et al., 2013, Rand and Houck, 2011, Raymaekers et al., 2011). The CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay (Genomica, Coslada, Spain) is a reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) DNA microarray method that makes it possible to detect simultaneously 17 RVs. The reliability of this procedure for the detection of RVs in children and adults has been previously shown (Culebras et al., 2013, Frobert et al., 2011, Pillet et al., 2013, Renois et al., 2010, Tokman et al., 2014). Nevertheless, little is known as to how this system compares with other multiplex platforms. In the current study, the performance characteristics of the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay was compared to that of the xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay for detection of RVs in clinical specimens from children and adults with influenza-like syndromes or lower tract respiratory infections.",

            "text": "This was a retrospective study including a total of 183 nonconsecutive upper (n = 125) or lower tract (n = 58) respiratory specimens obtained from unique patients received at the Microbiology Services of the Hospital Ramon y Cajal from Madrid and the Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario from Valencia, between January 2007 and December 2010. The clinical indications for RVs testing included the occurrence of influenza-like clinical symptoms or x-ray\u2013documented lower respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis or pneumonia). Relevant clinical and demographic data from patients and the type of specimens collected are shown in Table 1\n. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected with flocked swabs in universal transport medium (Beckton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA, or Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). The remaining types of specimens were transported undiluted. In all cases, specimens were received at the laboratory within 30 min of collection and were conserved at 4 \u00b0 C until processed (within 18 h of reception). Nucleic acid extraction was performed using the Qiagen EZ-1 Viral extraction kit on the EZ1 Robot instrument (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) at Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario or the NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u2122 method (BioM\u00e9rieux, Madrid, Spain) at the Hospital Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, following routine diagnostic protocols established at each center and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both nucleic acid extraction platforms have been validated for the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay by the manufacturer (package insert; www.luminexcorp.com/Assays/xTAGRVP). Likewise, the NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u2122 method has been previously validated for its use coupled to the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay (Frobert et al., 2011, Pillet et al., 2013). In turn, the Qiagen EZ-1 Viral extraction kit has been validated by the manufacturer (personal communication) and by our group (unpublished results) against the manual nucleic acid extraction and purification method recommended by the manufacturer in the package insert. Sample volumes of 200 and 250 \u03bcL were used for nucleic acid extraction by the EZ1 and the NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u2122 platforms, respectively. Both methods use isopropanol as a solvent. The nucleic acids were eluted in a volume of 60 and 55 \u03bcL for the EZ-1 and the NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u2122 kits, respectively. Both leftover specimens and nucleic acid extracts were then conserved at \u221270 \u00b0C for further investigations. Initial testing at both laboratories was performed with the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay. Frozen nucleic acid extracts that had been stored for a maximum of 6 months were thawed for testing with the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay. Either original specimens stored at \u221270 \u00b0C (new extraction) or frozen nucleic acid extracts (when available) were used to analyze the discrepancies. In order to determine whether long-term storage and repeated freezing and thawing (maximum, 3 cycles) had any effect on RVs detectability, 10 randomly selected nucleic acid extracts that were subjected to nested PCR sequencing for analysis of discrepancies were reanalyzed by both the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay and the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay. Reanalyses gave similar results to those obtained previously.",

            "text": "The Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay was used in the current study. In this assay, nucleic acids from the sample are converted to complementary DNA and mixed with short sequences (TAG primers) of DNA specific to each viral target. If the target is present, the primer will bind and will be lengthened through a process called target specific primer extension. During this extension, a label is incorporated. Color-coded beads are added to identify the tagged primers. Attached to each differently colored bead is an anti-TAG sequence specific to 1 of the extended TAG primers. Each anti-TAG only binds to the complementary TAG sequence on the primer. Samples are then placed in a Luminex instrument where beads are read and analyzed by lasers. The lasers identify the color of the bead (specific to a virus of subtype) and the presence or absence of the labeled primer. The MS2 phage genome (ssRNA, size 3569 nt.) is added to the specimens and serves as a control for nucleic acid extraction efficiency (internal positive control). The bacteriophage Lambda is added to the amplification reactions as a control for RT-PCR efficiency. RT-PCR was performed according to the xTAG RVP Fast assay product insert instructions (10-\u03bcL template volume) on a UnoCycler thermocycler (VWR International BVBA, Leuve, Belgium). RT-PCR was followed by a single-step hybridization of PCR products to the fluorescent bead array and incubation with reporter reagents. The plate was then analyzed using the xMAP 200 IS instrument (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) using the xPONENT software (v3.1).",

Only viral agents missed by either one or the other assay were targeted in the analysis of discordances. Hence, the presence of viral agents detected by both systems was not confirmed by nested PCR coupled to sequencing. We distinguished between fully and partial discordant results. The former referred to qualitative discrepancies (positive by one method, but negative by the other assay, or when the virus detected was different in each assay). The latter were those in which both assays were coincident in at least 1 virus, although 1 assay could identify more viruses than the other. Full concordance was defined as obtaining identical results by both methods (including negative results).",

Both assays have a comparable hands-on time and time to result (slightly longer for the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay; approximately 5.5 h versus 4 h). Our data indicated the following: i) the overall degree of concordance between both assays was 80% (Kappa coefficient, 0.62). As discussed below, this was mostly due to discrepancies in the detection of picornaviruses. In this sense, the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay was clearly superior (P\n < 0.001) over the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay. ii) The sensitivity of the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay was higher than that of the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay for most targeted agents, except notably for picornaviruses.

False-positive results were scarce, and most frequently obtained with the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay, especially for hBoV and some PIVs, and notably in the context of mixed infections. Mispriming is a likely reason accounting for these false-positive results. Nevertheless, given the high overall sensitivity of CLART\u00ae PneumoVir, we cannot rule out the possibility of these being true positives that remained undetected by the nested PCR assay employed for resolution of discrepancies. This is in contrast to previously published data (Pillet et al., 2013, Tokman et al., 2014).
