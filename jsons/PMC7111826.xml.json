            "text": "TGEV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (de Groot et al., 2011). The infection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) leads to severe diarrhoea especially in piglets at age of up to 2 weeks, resulting in significant economic loss in swine-producing areas around the world (Kim and Chae, 2001). TGEV contains a large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Sandrine et al., 2012). About two-thirds of the TGEV genome (28.5 kb) encodes the replicase gene (rep) at the 5\u2032 end, and other one-third of the viral genes encodes the structural, and non-structural, proteins at the 3\u2032 end (Rota et al., 2003). TGEV has four main structural proteins: spike (S), integral membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), and a small envelope protein (sM), following the order 5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 (Penzes et al., 2001).",

In addition, TGEV N protein causing cell cycle arrest in PK-15 cells has been reported (Ding et al., 2014). Infection by TGEV causes villous atrophy throughout jejunum and the ileum, in other words, infection by TGEV is observed mainly in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) (Pospischil et al., 1981); however, other concerns about the TGEV N protein in IEC are not fully understood, particularly the N protein-effected physiological changes in the host cells.",

Besides, in order to confirm the percentage of cells in each phases of the G0/G1, S, and G2/M(Fig. 3B), histograms quantitative analysis was employed. These data suggest that the DNA content of S-phase increased, while the G0/G1 and G2/M phases showed slight changes and that TGEV N protein prolonged the S-phase cell cycle and prevented GFP-N expressing cells from entering the G2/M phase. The results show that TGEV N protein could cause S-phase prolongation. As shown in Fig. 3C, comparing with control cells, the Cyclin A protein level was significantly decreased in N protein expressing cells. To further support these findings, real-time quantitative PCR assay were uesd to determine the cyclin A mRNA level. The results show that, in the GFP-N expressing cells, cyclin A mRNA levels are significantly lower than that in control cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that S-phase prolongation induced by TGEV N protein is closely related to cyclin A protein degradation and can down-regulate cyclin A transcription.",

Coronaviruses generally do not induce a high inflammatory response such as IL-6, IL-1, and IL-8 (Hoffmann et al., 2002). IL-8 production plays an important role in the over-expression and modulation of Bcl-2 (Escudero-Lourdes et al., 2012). In this study, we found that the TGEV N protein up-regulated IL-8 expression in host cells. The degradation of the TGEV N protein, when inhibited by MG132 proteasome inhibitor, was mainly through the proteasome pathway. More researches showed that, in untransfected cells treated with MG132, IL-8 production was much lower than that in untreated cells; however, in the N-GFP expressing cells, IL-8 production showed a slight change than that in untreated cells, indicating that MG132 was able to inhibit IL-8 expression in untransfected cells and that TGEV N protein contributed to antagonism of the effects of MG132. Taken together, TGEV N protein can cause ER stress and activated NF-\u03baB. As a result, the IL-8 expression was increased and thus enhanced the expression of Bcl-2.",
