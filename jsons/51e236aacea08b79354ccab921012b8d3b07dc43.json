Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, the recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Hence, the actual reproduction number was calculated . We analyzed the dependence of basic reproductions R 0 on the confidence of our model. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease out if the number of reproduction was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic's differential equations.",

            "text": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan City on December 2019, the opinions of scientists, researchers and commen-tators contradict each other every day. On 7 January, the coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) which was named as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities [12] , and has become a pandemic especially by travelers [11] . This forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider the dramatic spread of the infection in March 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern. This epidemic is characterized by its rapid spread and its symptoms do not appear quickly. In particular, accord-ing to the WHO, the incubation period is from 2 days to 14 days [12] . In addition, there is no anti-viral treatment or vaccination officially approved for the management or prevention of this epidemic. In order to fight this outbreak, the public health decision and policy makers should decide and follow strategic and health-care management. Since the declaration of the first case of COVID-19 in Tunisia in early March 2020, thousands of screenings have been carried out in Tunisia. Following the first recommendations of the WHO Tunisia, as France, Italy or Spain, first opted for rare and targeted screenings on suspicious people, their entourage and certain sources of contamination; in particular for people arriving from abroad. Next, If a person is positive, the authorities try to trace all the people with whom he has been in contact and they are called to place themselves in self-containment without necessarily being tested. They can only be tested if they themselves have symptoms of COVID-19.",

In fact, we noticed that people previously infected and recovered from COVID-19 are generally excluded as susceptible individuals in the modeling, which would have an impact on predicting the number of cases that will occur in the near future. In our approach we chose to integrate them into the model as a recovered-exposed population and which we will note E r . In addition, at the individual level, if people can find out if they have been or slightly infected and cured, and if they show civility and respect the distancing, they can safely return to work once the general quarantine is off.",
