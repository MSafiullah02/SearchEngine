The diagnosis of this infection remains complex (Al Johani and Hajeer, 2016, Sung et al., 2016, Ahmed, 2017a) and it has a high fatality rate (Ahmed, 2017b, Ahmed, 2017c, Aleanizy et al., 2017, Sherbini et al., 2017, Kim et al., 2017). The early detection and identification of individuals at high risk of a disease is the most effective strategy to improve patient clinical outcomes (Ahmed, 2017a) and reduce the costs of testing, both physical and economic (Ahmed et al., 2011, Ahmed et al., 2013). The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) has been found to be valid and accurate for the evaluation of respiratory swabs, sputum, and other endotracheal aspirate material (Corman et al., 2012a, Corman et al., 2012b). However, although rRT-PCR is the most accurate and sensitive test available at the authors\u2019 centers, absolute identification of MERS-CoV may require multiple clinical specimens from different sources and take days (Corman et al., 2012a, Corman et al., 2012b, Anon, 2018a).",

The current guidelines include fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic diseases, and risk of exposure to MERS-CoV. In clinical practice, identifying high-risk individuals can be challenging, since most laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV patients report common clinical risk indices to patients with other respiratory conditions. For instance, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are common for both MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV patients (Mohd et al., 2016). Thus, further exploration must take place to reduce the risk of MERS-CoV infection. A risk prediction model is urgently needed to stratify patients with suspected MERS-CoV. This may decrease the risk of virus transmission to others who are in close contact, for example healthcare workers, patients, and hospital visitors, by allowing the careful management of those who are potentially infected at an early stage of infection. Developing a MERS-CoV prediction model may more efficiently aid physicians in identifying individuals at high risk and selecting the necessary test(s) to improve prevention and control measures.",

In this study, \u2018contact with a sick patient\u2019 and \u2018contact with a sick camel\u2019 were combined into one variable due to the small number in each category. Severe illness was based on a subjective judgment. An additional potential limitation was that the duration of symptoms was not available for these patients. This study investigated a very specific population (pneumonia) at only two centers, which could compromise the applicability and generalizability of the risk prediction model. Moreover, the prediction model may not be generalizable to patients who do not fulfill the MOH guidelines. Further validation of the prediction model on an external sample and prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary, specifically in relevant settings: emergency, outpatient, inpatient, and community.",
