A negative correlation was found between the CT stage and SPO2 and lymphocyte number were analysed in the present study; that is, the higher the CT stage, the lower the SPO2 and the lower the lymphocyte number. There was no correlation between CT stage and hypersensitive C-reactive protein. Therefore, the changes of SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers can reflect the progress of CT imaging to a certain extent, although the correlation was not significant. Therefore, the most intuitive index for monitoring the absorption of inflammatory lesions in the lungs is chest CT. SPO2 and the lymphocyte number can be used as reference indexes, while hypersensitive C-reactive protein has no reference value.",

Patients with typical lung signs should be included in the clinically suspected cases for quarantine. For patients without visible lung signs but with clinical symptoms, lung CT should be rechecked in 3\u20135 days. (2) Positive lung CT results instead of the positive nucleic acid test should be used as a criterion for admission to the quarantine ward. (3) Hospitalised patients should undergo CT examinations every 5\u20137 days, and a low-dose scan should be employed. In summary, clinicians and radiologists should recognise the importance of chest CT in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, be familiar with the features and diagnostic points of the chest imaging of COVID-19, and strengthen communication within the radiology community, which is especially crucial in the battle against COVID-19.",
