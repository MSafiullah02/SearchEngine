The transmission of pathogens from other vertebrate animals to humans is of particular concern because the resulting diseases, known as zoonoses, have caused major epidemics in the past and continue to pose enormous threats to the human population, as exemplified by the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak (1, 2). In a broader sense, viral and bacterial pathogens are among the strongest drivers of evolutionary change and the genomes of vertebrate species have been shaped, to a large extent, by adaptations to pathogens.",

            "text": "To cope with viral infections, vertebrate species have evolved response strategies which can be classified into resistance and tolerance (3). Resistance depends on the efficient sensing of the infection and mounting of antiviral responses that involve programmed death of infected cells, suppression of viral replication, inflammation and the establishment of adaptive immunity. However, pathogens can also trigger overreactions of the immune system which cause more harm to the individual than the infectious agent itself (4, 5). Therefore, tolerance to infections has evolved as an alternative response of many hosts to specific pathogens (6, 7). In this scenario, the pathogens are not efficiently eliminated but the pathogen or defense-induced damage to the host is reduced. Tolerance does not depend on, or is even impeded by, the early sensing of pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs) and its mechanisms of protection are not yet fully understood (6, 8, 9). Species that tolerate infections can carry a high burden of infectious agents, and therefore may be important reservoirs for transmissions to other species. This notion is supported by the finding that bats tolerate many viral infections some of which have spread to humans causing zoonoses such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (7).",

Eight species of pangolins form the mammalian order Pholidota which is most closely related to Carnivora (cat-like and dog-like carnivorans). They are insectivorous and toothless animals whose body is largely covered by keratinous scales. The immune defense of pangolins has not been characterized yet except for reports on the deficiencies of TLR5, a receptor of bacterial flagellin (15) and interferon-\u03b5, an antiviral cytokine of epithelia (16, 17). The receptor of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is conserved in pangolins (18) and coronaviruses isolated from pangolins have a receptor binding domain in their spike protein that is uniquely similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 (10, 19).",

IFIH1 senses cytoplasmic RNA of coronaviruses and other viruses (27, 34, 35). Comparison of the IFIH1 gene locus showed conservation of the arrangement of IFIH1 relative to the neighboring genes in mammals (Figure 1A). In the Malayan pangolin, IFIH1 is inactivated by more than 10 frameshift and in-frame stop mutations. In silico translation of the pangolin IFIH1 pseudogene (GenBank gene ID: 108398082) and alignment of the resulting amino acid sequence to that of human IFIH1 showed numerous disruptive mutations (Figure S1A). An open reading frame in exon 1 of the Malayan pangolin encodes a theoretical protein that lacks essential domains and has only 100 amino acid residues whereas functional IFIH1 proteins consist of more than 1,000 amino acid residues (Figure S2). Detailed comparative analysis of exon 1 showed the presence of multiple frameshift mutations and in-frame stop codons in the IFIH1 genes of Malayan, Chinese and tree pangolins (Figure 1B). One of the frameshift mutations and one premature stop mutation are shared by all three species, suggesting that these mutations have already been present in their last common ancestor that lived more than 20 million years ago (32).",

Influenza virus and other viruses induce ZBP1-mediated innate immune responses in humans and mice (24, 25). Comparison of the ZBP1 gene locus showed conservation of the arrangement of ZBP1 relative to the neighboring genes in mammals (Figure 2A). In the Malayan pangolin, ZBP1 is inactivated by multiple in-frame stop codons. In silico translation of the pangolin ZBP1 pseudogene (GenBank gene ID: 108390931) and alignment of the resulting amino acid sequence to that of human ZBP1 showed premature termination of the translation product and lack of the carboxy-terminal half of the protein (Figure S1B). Mutations that prevent the production of a functional protein were found in all segments of the ZBP1 pseudogene of the Malayan pangolin. The nucleotide sequence alignment of ZBP1 exon 4 shows the presence of in-frame stop codons in three species of pangolins (M. javanica, M. pentadactyla, M. tricuspis) (Figure 2B).",

Both insufficient and overshooting responses to viral infections have deleterious effects, leading to strong selection for resistant or tolerant host genotypes (37, 38). Bats have retained functional RNA sensor genes (Table S3) but exert only dampened antiviral responses, indicating that they have adapted to the evolutionary pressure from viruses by decreasing inflammatory responses and by enhancing tolerance to viral replication (39\u201342). The results of the present study suggest that pangolins are another group of mammals with evolutionarily downregulated defense against a subset of viruses, namely those sensed by IFIH1/MDA5 or ZBP1 in other species. Our data urge to study the virus burden of pangolins, their antiviral immune response and their ability to act as reservoirs for viruses with zoonotic potential, especially coronaviruses. While genetic suppression of IFIH1/MDA5 and ZBP1-dependent pathways had neutral or beneficial effects in the evolution of pangolins, pharmaceutical suppression of IFIH1/MDA5 and ZBP1-dependent signaling may be beneficial for human patients with overreactions to viral nucleic acids.",
