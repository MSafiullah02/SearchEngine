Ct values of Orf1ab and N gene using real-time RT-PCR assay were inversely related to viral RNA copy number, with Ct values of 32.04, 28.81, 25.14 and 21.54 corresponding to 5.27 \u00d7 10 4 , 5.27 \u00d7 10 5 , 5.27 \u00d7 10 6 and 5.27 \u00d7 10 7 copies per ml. Thus, Ct values were used to approximately evaluate the viral load detected in nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs. A chi-squared test was performed for between-group comparisons of percentages. All statistical tests were two-sided with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant and were performed using R (v.3.1.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing).",
