No more than two log 2 HAU difference in HA titers was observed between EP and CP viruses with the exception of CP A/Wisconsin/67/05 for 48 and 72 h supernatants and for B/Malaysia/2506/04 at 72 and 96 h post-infection using tRBC (Table 1). For infected A549 cells HA titers were only observed for B/Malaysia/2506/04 and were similar for both EP and CP viruses (Table 2). No detectable hemagglutination was observed for supernatants from both influenza A virus infected A549 cells. Using all three RBCs none of the EP and CP virus infected NCI H292 cells demonstrated hemagglutination activity. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the HA titers both egg and cell-based influenza viruses from MDCK and A549 cells. Absence of hemagglutination in A549 and NCI H292 is consistent with restricted virus replication observed using FFA and qRT-PCR assays. Results from hemagglutination assay confirm efficient virus replication in MDCK cells and demonstrate minimal impact of production substrate on receptor biding property of ca influenza virus. 3.7. Sequence analysis of MDCK, A549 and NCI H292 derived cold-adapted virus The HA and NA sequences of MDCK, A549 and NCI H292 cells derived A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Wisconsin/67/05 and B/Malaysia/2506/04 virus were compared to the sequences of the respective virus used as inoculum. No sequence differences in HA and NA segments were identified in either EP or CP B/Malaysia/2506/04 from MDCK, A549 and NCI H292. The sequence of the HA and NA segments from EP and CP A/Wisconsin/67/05 from MDCK cells was found to be identical to the sequence of the inoculum. Similarly HA and NA segment sequences from EP and only CP NA segment sequence for A/New Caledonia/20/99 from MDCK and A549 cells were found to be identical to the sequence of the inoculum. However, the CP HA segment sequence had a substitution identified to be 505G (141S) compared to the inoculum sequence of 505A (141N) for both MDCK and A549 derived A/New Caledonia/20/99 virus. The nucleotide change resulting in amino acid substitution at position 141 (S to N) for CP A/New Caledonia/20/99 from MDCK and A549 cells of HA occurred in the domain equivalent to the antigenic site A. Interestingly, the G505A leading to A141N amino acid substitution has been previously reported for cold-adapted A/New Caledonia/20/99 (Buonagurio et. al.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": " Egg  4  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  8  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  24  256  16  32  128  64  32  32  32  64  48  512  128  64  256  256  128  128  256  128  72  512  128  128  256  256  512  256  256  512  96  512  128  128  256  512  512  128 256 256 Egg  4  0  0  0  8  0  0  0  12  0  0  0  24  16  32  32  48  64  128  128  72  128  128  128  96  128  128  256   MDCK  4  0  0  0  8  0  0  0  12  0  0  0  24  16  32  64  48  64  128  256  72  128  128  256  96  128  128  256 Abbreviations used: cRBC-chicken red blood cells; tRBC-turkey red blood cells; gpRBC-guinea pig red blood cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1, "end": 274, "text": "Egg  4  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  8  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  24  256  16  32  128  64  32  32  32  64  48  512  128  64  256  256  128  128  256  128  72  512  128  128  256  256  512  256  256  512  96  512  128  128  256  512  512  128", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 283, "end": 511, "text": "Egg  4  0  0  0  8  0  0  0  12  0  0  0  24  16  32  32  48  64  128  128  72  128  128  128  96  128  128  256   MDCK  4  0  0  0  8  0  0  0  12  0  0  0  24  16  32  64  48  64  128  256  72  128  128  256  96  128  128  256", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}]}
