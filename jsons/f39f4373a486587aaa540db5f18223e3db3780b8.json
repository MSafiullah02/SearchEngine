Within the P[8] genotype, the human rotaviruses from Wenzhou formed three lineages separated by human viruses identified from geographic regions both inside and outside of China. In the P [4] genotype the human viruses from Wenzhou were closely related to each other and formed a clade with human rotaviruses from the USA. Within the P[9] genotype the Chinese viruses identified here and previously were closely related to cat rotaviruses, indicative of their zoonotic origin.
