            "text": "Emerging viral diseases are frequent public health threats as a result of their potential to develop from small outbreaks into epidemics and pandemics. On 31 December 2019 Chinese health authorities announced dozens of pneumonia infections in Wuhan city (Hubei province) without a recognized aetiology [1]. The first reported patients with pneumonia in Wuhan had a history of visiting or association with a local seafood market where wild animals are sold. The infectious agent was subsequently identified on 7 January 2020 as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) thought to have originated from the Huanan seafood market [2]. Because of its marked similarity in terms of clinical symptoms and biological nature with the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. After rapid isolation of the virus, its genome sequence became publically available and was submitted on 12 January 2020 to GenBank (accession no. MN908947.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2). Phylogenetic analyses showed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two SARS coronaviruses of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, but is distant from human SARS-CoV (79% sequence homology) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (50%) [3,4]. Epidemiologic investigations showed that different animals (bats, pangolins, snakes) could have been intermediate hosts that facilitated the spillover of SARS-CoV-2 as a distinct human Betacoronavirus from bats to the human population [[4], [5], [6]].",

Reports have shown that adults and the elderly are the most infected by SARS-CoV-2, with a slight predominance in men; only a low proportion of children have contracted the infection [[8], [9], [10]]. Moreover, the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes or cardiovascular or respiratory disorders greatly affects outcome.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome has great sequence similarity (89\u201396.3%) with two bat coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and 79% to 82% with that of human SARS-CoV [4,12,13]. The genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 27 proteins (Fig. 1(B)). The longest ORF is located at the 5\u02b9 terminus encoding for 15 nonstructural proteins collectively involved in virus replication and possibly in immune evasion. The 3\u02b9 terminus of the genome encodes for structural and accessory proteins [3]. Hypervariable genomic hot spots have been detected in the spike gene and in other ORFs for nonstructural proteins [14].",

The spike protein is composed of two subunits, the S1 domain of a single polypeptide containing the receptor-binding domain and the S2 domain, composed of highly conserved polypeptides associated with the envelope. The external subdomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike globular head S1 has only 40% similarity with its counterparts in the bat and human SARS-CoV virion [12]. The outer portion of the external subdomain responsible for direct contact with the human receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE-2) has the most diversity in amino acids. Such variations are believed to have evolved from homologous recombination between a bat coronavirus and another coronavirus of unknown origin [5]. Orf3b is a putative novel protein that seems to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, while Orf8 is an accessory protein shorter than its counterparts found in other Betacoronavirus with unknown function.",

Only the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 had associations with the Huanan seafood market; subsequent sources of infection were infected individuals. Human-to-human transmission is believed to be the major route for worldwide disease spread [17]. The intermediate host in Wuhan was suspected to be snakes and/or pangolins [5], but this remains to be confirmed. Travel and importation played a critical role in the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 to Korea, Japan, the Middle East and Europe [18,19]. During the early weeks of the epidemic, the basic reproductive values (R0) were calculated to be between 2 and 3.5, which is higher than SARS [20,21]. The R0 is defined as the expected number of secondary subjects infected by a single infectious person in a susceptible population.",

Currently all European countries are affected, and thousands of new cases are being reported daily, without known dynamics. Perhaps there is no preexisting immunity in the population; all individuals are considered susceptible. The transmission chain might go unnoticed during the incubation period of infected or asymptomatic individuals, who actively and unwittingly transfer the infection. An as yet unknown new mutant type may be a major factor for the current overwhelming increase in cases despite the preemptively implemented precautions and countermeasures taken by at-risk countries. Indeed, analysis of 103 genomes derived from SARS-CoV-2 showed that genomes fall into one of two types: S (the ancestor) and L [25]. The L type was prevalent during early January 2020 but decreased in later weeks. Furthermore, recent studies support the evolution of the virus by successive mutations and recombination processes [26,27]. Comparative studies of genomes sequenced from cases of disease occurring in European subjects compared to previously sequenced genomes in China are needed to verify the previous findings.",

            "text": "Unlike the precedent SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 had unique characteristics and chances to become a pandemic. Firstly, the initial case definition set by the CCDC was narrow and was based solely on signs of pneumonia. Subsequent analysis of the first cases showed that about 81% of patients experience only mild disease, which undoubtedly increased transmission within the community by asymptomatic carriers [10]. The WHO estimated the mortality rate to be between 3% and 4%, with increased mortality in the elderly or in individuals with comorbidities. Because of the lack of data regarding the true number of infected individuals worldwide, it is still too early to calculate exact mortality rates. Secondly, the 22 March 2020 definition of a suspected case set by WHO occurs in a patient with any acute respiratory illness who has been in contact with a person with a case of confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms. This definition is based on reports that calculated the incubation period to range from 1 to 14 days [29]. However, recent reports have found that the incubation period might be as long as 24 days [9,30]. This period is much longer than the 14 days used by the WHO to guide quarantine policies, so truly infected persons may be missed during the disease's long incubation period, and they may contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, international surveillance estimated that up to two thirds of exported cases from China went undetected [31].",

Furthermore, the industry, commerce and travel of China with the rest of the world has doubled since 2000, which aided the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 [32,33]. The Spring Festival and Lunar Year events are also believed to have played a critical role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within China, as millions of Wuhan dwellers travelled out of the city before the implementation of lockdown measures just after the outbreak. The same situation applies to Europe, with intense international travel and business, as well as free travel within the eurozone. The exact underlying reasons for the ongoing rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe remain unknown. The suspected in vivo evolution of the virus and its transmission by asymptomatic carriers may be major factors [27,34,35].",

Isolation of individuals after onset of symptoms will be too late, and transmission to others would already have occurred during the incubation period [30,37]. Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic patients was documented in first clusters in Germany and Vietnam during early February 2020 [38,39]. Dependence on detection of high body temperature (fever) for ruling out asymptomatic carriage, as was used during SARS containment, has been deemed inefficient in SARS-CoV-2 [40]. Additionally, the R0 value of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than of SARS (3.28 vs. 2.2) [20,21]. Indeed, the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is obvious by a global increase of more than 72 000 cases in 3 days according to WHO reports (from 18 to 20 March 2020) [7].",

Bilateral patchy shadows were frequently noted on chest X-ray, while ground-glass opacifications are found in patients with ARDS. Typical computed tomographic (CT) findings include multiple ground-glass opacifications with or without reticular pattern, and parenchymal consolidations involving both lungs [46,47]. Other common CT features include microvascular dilatation, thick interlobar septa and air bronchogram [47]. Interestingly, CT changes have also been noted in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms and before virus RNA detection in upper respiratory specimens [48]. Time required for recovery ranges from 2 weeks in mild infections to 3 to 6 weeks in severe disease. Extrapulmonary complications include acute injuries in heart, liver and kidneys [9,49].",

The administration of 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin daily resulted in clearance of the virus from the nasopharynx within 6 ix days [55].

Indeed, China has applied the largest quarantine in history to contain the disease. China's efforts have cut the person-to-person transmission chain and have demonstrated that isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment are the only promising measures to fight SARS-CoV-2. As a respiratory virus of high transmissibility, applying social distancing to reduce interactions between people on a mass scale is beneficial, especially when detection of cases is swift [56]. If community transmission continued to expand, social distancing would be insufficient and community containment would be needed. The efficiency of community containment is apparent in China, where normal daily life is gradually being resumed in Wuhan after a marked decline in cases. Nonetheless, such measures are challenging and require partnership between local and state officials in different fields. The media should also tap into their ability to communicate trusted information about containment benefits and to preempt false rumours and panic.",

The cost of wide tracking and community containment cannot be outweighed by long-term economic losses and disease burden if transmission continues. Additionally, rapid responses and decision making alongside free (or at least affordable) laboratory testing will facilitate the delineation of hot spot zones. Certain community containment procedures, such as cancellation of public events and closure of institutions, are evident in many countries. These precautions will not be fruitful unless parallel thorough surveillance accompanied by medical observation and legal actions are taken if quarantine is violated. Recently Italy, France, Spain and the Philippines initiated implementation of lockdown measures, with law enforcement in some cases, to control the overwhelming increase in cases. In third world countries, lockdown measures are extremely challenging as a result of the high proportion of low-wage jobs where workers seek employment opportunities on a daily basis. Finally, efficient deactivation of different coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 was not evaluated) has been reported with disinfectants such as 62% to 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute; this efficacy is highly likely to apply to SARS-CoV-2 [57].",

Firstly, the origin of the virus and the nature of its spillover from its natural reservoir to humans are still unknown. It is known that bats and pangolins are hunted for food in China, but so far these animals have not been confirmed to be the origin of the disease [6]. Moreover, the mode of virus replication and the human immunoresponse to SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown. Secondly, the virus was detected in faecal samples from infected patients, but the disease's potential for faecal\u2013oral transmissibility remains unaddressed by researchers [53,58,59]. Thirdly, phylogenetic analyses have shown genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in different countries through different periods. Whether in vivo evolution occurs in humans or in another intermediate animal host is still unproven. Although the evidence suggests the existence and identity of an intermediate host, this has not been experimentally proven. Fourthly, the period during which the SARS-CoV-2 virion retains its infectivity when shed and deposited on surfaces and in the environment is also unclear. Indeed, the efficacy of handwashing in deactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virion has not been tested. Fifthly, the reason SARS-CoV-2 infections predominate in men is unknown. A smoking habit in Asian men was expected to be the underlying cause, but no solid evidence is yet available [60]. Sixthly, the initial administration of corticosteroids during the early stage of the SARS epidemic was justified because corticosteroids mitigated the inflammatory response, but it was subsequently halted as a result of the delay in virus clearance [61]. Lately a small-size (n = 201) observational study reported that methylprednisolone treatment was associated with a decrease in the risk of death in patients with ARDS [62]. Whether corticosteroids will have the same effect in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unclear.",

Moreover, they are also strongly advised to use protective measures because they comprise an at-risk population as a result of nosocomial exposure.
