She began to receive chemotherapy (vinorelbine 40 mg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 40 mg intravenously on Days 2 and 8) on May 8, 2003. The patient had a sudden onset of fever (38.3 \u00b0C) with shivering the next day. No coughing, headache, myalgia, rigor, nausea, or emesis was present, and no rales were detected. The patient's blood test showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3.9 \u00d7 109/L, a neutrophil (GR) % of 90%, a lymphocyte (LN) % of 9%, and a platelet [PLT] count of 92 \u00d7 109/L. A chest X\u2010ray showed lower right lung infiltrates (Fig. 1). Ofloxacin (200 mg intravenously) was administered twice daily. The fever continued the next day, and a blood test showed a WBC count of 4.4 \u00d7 109/L, a GR% of 81.2%, a LN% of 17.1%, and a PLT count of 60 \u00d7 109/L. A chest X\u2010ray showed that the infiltrates in the lower right lung had enlarged significantly (Fig. 1). Infection with the SARS virus was then suspected, despite the patient's denial of close contact with any patient with SARS. Specialists from Peking University First Hospital were consulted, and the diagnosis of SARS was confirmed. The patient was transferred to a specialized SARS hospital and was treated accordingly.",

Patient 1 developed a high fever (39 \u00b0C) with headache and myalgia 3 days after receiving chemoembolization. However, the patient presented with the same signs and symptoms previously during chemoembolization. This indicated a febrile reaction to tumor necrosis. Patient 5 had a sudden onset of rigor and fever 1 hour after receiving a thymosin transfusion. Although bilateral lung infiltrates with ill\u2010defined borders were found in the chest X\u2010ray, the diagnosis favored an allergic reaction. Patient 8 was a female patient with primary hepatic malignancy. Her absolute neutrophil count was only 0.5 \u00d7 109/L at that time, and she had developed fever > 38 \u00b0 C on several occasions in the preceding 6 months. Her body temperature would decrease after she received prophylactic antibiotics and agents that increased leucocyte counts. Thus, febrile neutropenia was suspected. SARS was ruled out for the other seven patients due to their positive responses to experimental antibiotics. In these seven patients, body temperature decreased, and pulmonary lesions were absorbed. Two of these seven patients (Patients 7 and 10) had lung carcinoma and presented with dyspnea and fever. The possibility of SARS was finally ruled out for one patient (Patient 2) after she began receiving superbroad\u2010spectrum antibiotics and exhibited favorable signs 4 days later (Fig. 2).",

Patients could not respond to an attack by the SARS virus in the same way that healthy individuals could.6, 7 The clinical manifestation of SARS in patients with cancer may be atypical. Moreover, the increased possibility of infection in patients with cancer paralleled the decline in neutrophil counts and increased significantly when the number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood decreased to 1 \u00d7 109/L.8 Both situations made the differential diagnosis of SARS in patients with cancer difficult. In addition, patients sometimes denied their contact history during the peak of the SARS epidemic; this exacerbated the difficulty of diagnosing SARS and rendered the epidemiologic evidence for the WHO case definitions unreliable.",
