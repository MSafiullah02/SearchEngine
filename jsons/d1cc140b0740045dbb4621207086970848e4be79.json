In this research, we use Taiwan SARS data to investigate the differences in connectivity between personal and geographical contacts in the construction of social networks for these diseases.

Therefore, through his geographical contacts he is connected to other patients of these three hospitals. Table 5 shows the connectivity analysis of all nine types of contact.
