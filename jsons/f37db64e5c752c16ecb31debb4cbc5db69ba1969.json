Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56\u00b0C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Methods: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times and chemical inactivation approach on NAT. Results: Our work showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. Conclusion: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.",

Owing to the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2, many Chinese laboratories have inactivated the virus at 56-60 \u00b0C for 30-60 minutes before RNA extraction. Thermal inactivation at 56 \u00b0C has also been recommended to ensure the security of medical inspectors in Chinese expert's consensus (11) . The consensus also raises the uncertainty of whether heat inactivation may decrease the sensitivity of NAT (11) . Although it is suspected that such pretreatment may affect the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples with low viral loads, quantitative comparisons on its impact are still unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated the false-negative rates due to thermal inactivation. We further investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times and chemical inactivation approach on NAT. The other 15 weak positive throat swabs were stored in 3mL VTM or 3mL chemically inactivated buffer (lysis buffer, Qiagen) and the stool samples were kept in the sampling tube. All samples were kept at 4\u00b0C and transferred to the laboratory within four hours.",

In general, most of the inactivated samples exhibited higher Ct values (mean 33.07 \u00b1 SD 5.00) than those with non-inactivated treatment (mean 32.69 \u00b1 SD 4.92) with a mean increase of 0.38 (P=0.017, online Supplemental were much higher than those (median 0.14, range -0.38 to 1.57) in the HVL group (P=0.02, online Supplemental Table 1 ). These data suggested that in detectable samples of the LVL group, the tendency for increased Ct by thermal inactivation was more substantial than that in the HVL group.

Thermal inactivation showed no significant influence on qualitative results for specimens carrying high viral loads. However, for the weak positive specimens (Ct value range from 33.37 to 36.89), thermal inactivation could be one of the possible causes of false-negative results in laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2. It has been speculated that thermal inactivation might have a potential impact on detection in patients with early infection, causing NAT to lose its advantage of identifying patients with low viral loads. In our studies nearly half of the weak positive specimens (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) exhibited false-negative qualitative results after thermal inactivation in at least one parallel RT-PCR test. The mean Ct values of those 7 specimens (36.25), equivalent to about 700 copies/mL (21) , might provide a possible threshold for thermally susceptible results. Furthermore, we found the effects of thermal inactivation varied between different sample types, demonstrating that the composition of tested samples might influence their viral thermal-stability. Such variation in thermal stability has also been reported in previous studies that found thermal inactivation to SARS-CoV could be attenuated in the presence of fetal calf serum (20%) (22) or antithrombin III (23) . Considering the limited sample size in our study, a larger number of specimens might lead to a more significant result in sputum samples. We also observed that longer storage or preservation at room temperature could cause false-negative results in a portion of weak positive samples.",
