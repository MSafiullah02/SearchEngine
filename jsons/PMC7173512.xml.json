We use the term allergy to refer to the presence of one or more diseases associated with IgE sensitization, the most common of which are asthma, eczema, and rhinitis. The term atopy was originally introduced to account for the observation that the main allergic diseases occurred in the same families and appeared to have a common origin. However, it is often used synonymously with the term allergy.",

Although validity in an absolute sense may always be contested, what is as important in epidemiologic studies is standardization, meaning that the test is identical wherever and by whomever it is administered. Validity is essential to the measurement of absolute prevalence, but in many epidemiologic studies, we are as interested in relative prevalence, such as relative prevalence between age groups, countries, or districts, or differences between people exposed to various environmental or genetic risks. Standardization is essential for this, and considerable effort has been made to provide standardized measures, particularly for international studies.",

In many places, mites, grass, and cat allergens are among the most common allergens, and most sensitized individuals can be identified by testing for relatively few allergens.2, 3 Some test kits can identify a mixture of several allergens. In the past, they have been used to test for the occurrence of sensitization, and this may be cost-effective, but it leaves unclear which allergens are responsible for symptoms. Microchip technology and the development of recombinant and purified allergens have enabled testing for several allergens simultaneously and allowed more precise identification of the relevant allergens. The technology remains expensive and is not widely used in epidemiologic studies.",

The technique involves introducing a small amount of allergen under the outer layers of the skin using a needle or lancet and reading the size of the wheal that appears in the 15 minutes after the test is applied.4 This is compared with the wheal produced by a control solution (usually the diluent in which the allergens have been dissolved) and with a positive (usually histamine) control that tests whether the skin is able to respond to the release of mediators that the allergen induces. Skin tests have more operator-dependent variation than serologic tests, because they are influenced in part by the technique of the technician, but they typically are cheap and provide an immediate answer, which can be more satisfactory for the patient or participant. The criterion for a positive test result varies according to the purpose of testing. Using any test greater than the diluent control is more repeatable and less prone to observational error and reflects well the presence of allergen-specific IgE.5 However, in a clinical context, small wheals are rarely associated with allergic disease that can be ascribed to that allergen, and in a clinical context, wheals less than 3 mm in diameter usually are discounted as irrelevant.",

Figure 48-1\nshows the relationship between the proportion of the physicians in each country ascribing this death to asthma and the national mortality rate for asthma.17 There is a strong suggestion that the way doctors in each country view such marginal cases may be influencing the national mortality data. Whether this is still the case is uncertain. Since then, there has been a major increase in international consensus documents.Box 48-1Case 8: Retired Cement Factory Worker Who Was a Smoker\n\u2022He had a regular cough and sputum production for many years.\u2022His breathing could become rapidly worse, and he awoke during the night with wheezing.\u2022During a trial of prednisolone, he improved to some degree with a maximum peak flow rate of 140 L/min.\u2022He was maintained on prednisolone but died after worsening of his breathlessness over several days with nighttime waking.\nAdapted from Kelson MC, Heller RF.

Alternatively, the slope of the dose-response curve has been used as a continuous measure of airway reactivity, a method that uses epidemiologic information more efficiently but may be clinically less intuitive.27 Development of these tests for use in surveys has provided a tool for assessing a physiologic measure associated with asthma.

            "text": "During the past 10 years, food allergy has received increased attention, and there is a growing body of literature available regarding its epidemiology. Food allergy is an immune-mediated reaction to a food. It can produce a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including acute IgE-mediated reactions, mixed IgE-mediated and non\u2013IgE-mediated reactions that are often characterized by insidious gastrointestinal symptoms, and non\u2013IgE-mediated syndromes such as allergic colitis and food protein\u2013induced enterocolitis syndrome. Even among patients with acute IgE-mediated types of food-allergic reactions, symptoms can vary and include one or many of the following: urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, cough, wheezing, hoarseness, vomiting, diarrhea, oral pruritus, hypotension, and rhinorrhea. Because the diagnosis is based on the clinical history and diagnostic test results, with the gold standard being a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge, conducting large epidemiologic surveys can be difficult because of reliance on questionnaire-based tools for identification of food allergy and evidence of IgE sensitization. Because there is no validated questionnaire for food allergy and many reported food allergies are not confirmed when a full diagnostic evaluation is completed, estimates obtained from questionnaires are likely to be inflated.38\n",

The prevalence of food allergy and the foods that are most commonly implicated in food allergy vary widely across the world. For example, a meta-analysis found that the self-reported prevalence of food allergy ranged from 3% to 35%.55 Although some of the heterogeneity observed is attributable to study methodology, other studies that have focused on specific geographic regions and populations support the notion that there is marked worldwide heterogeneity in food allergy prevalence. For example, in the United States, the estimated prevalence of food allergy is 4% to 8% among children,56, 57 and in Australia, a prevalence of more than 10% among 1-year-old children has been reported.58 In contrast, findings from a population-based birth cohort from the United Kingdom indicate that between 2.2% and 5.5% of infants have food allergy in the first year of life,59 and in other U.K. studies, the estimated prevalence of food allergy among 6-year-old children is 1.6% to 2.5%,60 and among adolescents, it is 2.3%.61 An international study that used allergen-specific IgE data for young adults confirmed the heterogeneity of food allergy prevalence observed in the questionnaire-based studies.62 In this study, prevalence of sensitization to any 1 of 24 foods ranged from 7.7% in Iceland to 24.6% in the United States. However, sensitization to the major foods, such as fish, egg, and milk, was uncommon (<1%).",

In cross-sectional surveys, this pattern of disease is indistinguishable from a decline in disease with age. In the ECRHS, there was almost no net change in the prevalence of sensitization over the 8 years between the surveys within any birth cohort, but succeeding birth cohorts had increasingly high prevalence rates.

A greater occurrence of disease in MZ than in DZ twins is evidence for a genetic component to the disease because both types of twins are assumed to share environmental factors similarly. Significantly higher concordance rates for MZ twins have been observed in some small studies.110 Larger studies of twin registries also suggest a significant genetic contribution to asthma. In 6996 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry, Edfors-Lubs found the prevalence of asthma to be 3.8%.111 The higher concordance of asthma in MZ (19.8%) over DZ (4.8%) pairs suggests that genetic factors contribute to asthma.

In the Tucson study, lung function was measured within weeks of birth in 124 healthy infants. The subsequent incidence of wheezing illness over the first 6 years of life was increased in boys with high respiratory resistance and in girls with low functional residual capacity. One hypothesis for females being at higher risk of developing asthma or wheeze during adolescence or adulthood is the smaller relative airway caliber in women compared with men after puberty.121\n",

A distinction used to be made between asthma and other wheezy syndromes in children. However, the management is very similar, the distinction has fallen largely into disuse, and use of the term nonatopic asthma has become common for children, whereas it was prviously reserved for a condition associated with eosinophilic inflammation but negative skin test results that predominantly presented in middle age, often among women, and had a relatively poor prognosis.

In children 3 to 14 years old, atopy was strongly associated with attacks of wheezing and dyspnea, regardless of whether asthma had been diagnosed. Later analyses of the Tucson population indicated that the total serum IgE level was more strongly associated with the prevalence of asthma,125 an association that was also found in an NHANES analysis (discussed later). Another study using self-reported diagnosis of hay fever in a population sample from western Pennsylvania showed atopy to be more common in asthmatic than nonasthmatic children.126 Two other studies demonstrated parental atopy and asthma as risk factors for asthma in their children.127, 128 The results also demonstrated a complex interaction between these factors and the gender of the child. A study of 525 New Zealand children assessed the relationship of total serum IgE levels at the age 11 years and asthma, and investigators found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was strongly related to the serum IgE level (P trend < .0001).129, 130 Asthma was not reported for children with IgE levels of less than 32 IU/mL, whereas 36% of children with IgE levels of 1000 IU/mL or higher had asthma. Asthma and atopy are closely linked, and the causal nature of the factors seems to be complex and require more investigation. Nonetheless, atopy in parents and children does increase the risk of asthma and can be used as an empiric predictor.131\n",

However, breastfeeding may also be a route of exposure to a variety of immunologically active substances from the mother, such as tobacco smoke, cow's milk, eggs, wheat, maternal IgE, and sensitized lymphocytes.135 Many studies have investigated the association between breastfeeding, asthma, wheezing illness, and atopic disease, and they have been subject to several systematic reviews, most of which highlight the limitations and difficulties in conducting and interpreting such studies (e.g., confounding, recruitment bias, reporting bias, reverse causation, variation in breastfeeding patterns, inability to randomize and blind). The systematic reviews have themselves been reviewed in consensus documents, which conclude that the exclusive breastfeeding for 3 to 4 months of infants at high risk for atopic disease reduces the likelihood of atopic dermatitis and that breastfeeding beyond 3 to 4 months appears to confer no additional benefit.179, 180\n",

Beuther and Sutherland systematically reviewed prospective studies evaluating the association between BMI and incident asthma among adults.190 Meta-analysis of the data from 333,102 subjects participating in the seven identified studies demonstrated that being overweight or obese (BMI \u2265 25) was associated with an increase in the rate of 1-year incident asthma (OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.80), with evidence of a dose effect for being overweight (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.62) or obese (OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.43 to 2.59). There was no difference between sexes. A systematic review of similar literature for children and adolescents concluded that obesity precedes and is associated with the persistence and intensity of asthma symptoms.191 In observational designs, a potential methodologic concern is that nonspecific respiratory symptoms resulting from cardiorespiratory loading and deconditioning may be misclassified as asthma. Careful studies of children and adults suggest that asthma is not inappropriately overdiagnosed in the obese.192, 193\n",

The Wisconsin Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study prospectively evaluated the timing, frequency, severity, and cause of symptomatic viral infection in the first 3 years of life in relation to later wheezing illness in a cohort of 289 neonates at high familial risk for asthma.213 By using molecular technologies to identify viral infections in nasal lavage samples collected routinely and when symptomatic, this study highlighted the prognostic importance of HRV. Having one or more HRV-associated wheezing episodes during the first 3 years of life was more strongly associated with wheezing in the third year (OR = 10.0; 95% CI, 4.7 to 23.0) than having one or more RSV-associated wheezing episodes during the first 3 years of life (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.8). First-year wheezing associated with HRV was the strongest predictor for third-year wheeze (OR = 6.6).213 The pattern of viral respiratory tract infection in the first 3 years was different for children with or without asthma at the age of 6 years (Fig. 48-14\n).214 Asthma at 6 years of age was strongly associated with HRV-associated wheeze in the first 3 years of life (OR = 9.8; 95% CI, 4.3 to 22.0). The frequency of HRV-induced wheezing episodes increased in the first 3 years of life for children diagnosed with asthma by age 6, whereas for children without asthma, HRV-associated wheezing episodes declined in the first 3 years (see Fig. 48-14). Almost 90% of children with HRV-associated wheezing episodes in year 3 had been diagnosed with asthma by the age of 6 years, and HRV-associated wheeze was a more robust predictor for subsequent asthma than atopic sensitization to aeroallergens. Asthma at 6 years of age was also associated with RSV-associated wheezing episodes in the first 3 years (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 6.3). The likelihood of asthma by age 6 years being associated with RSV-induced wheeze in the first 2 years of life was increased only for children who had also had HRV-associated wheezing episodes.",

The cause of the sequelae is uncertain. The pulmonary injury may be acquired during mechanical ventilation of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), from the RDS itself, or from some other facet of prematurity. Prematurity has been examined as a risk factor for asthma in cohort studies of affected children and in cross-sectional studies. In one of the earliest reports, Northway and coworkers234 considered the first possibility\u2014that asthma is a long-term consequence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is a syndrome of chronic lung disease in premature infants who are mechanically ventilated for at least 1 week as a treatment for RDS. The clinical diagnosis requires the symptoms of persistent respiratory distress during infancy, dependence on supplemental oxygen, and abnormal chest radiographs. Northway and colleagues235 then studied adolescents and young adults born between 1964 and 1973 who had BPD in infancy and compared their long-term pulmonary outcomes with those of two control groups. They found that most subjects with a history of BPD in infancy had pulmonary dysfunction. Moreover, the increase in airway reactivity was not associated with a more frequent family history of asthma in this sample or with an increased prevalence of atopy. These findings suggest that lung injury resulting from mechanical ventilation of premature infants has a role in the pathogenesis of persistent pulmonary dysfunction that is similar to asthma.",

The group with a history of RDS had evidence of more hyperinflation and airway obstruction compared with controls. However, results from the histamine challenge to determine AHR and familial aggregation of AHR were inconclusive. The incidence of airway reactivity was elevated among cases and controls and among the mothers and siblings of cases and controls. The investigators suggest that the elevated incidence of AHR among mothers of both groups supports the hypothesis that there may be an association between the onset of premature labor and airway reactivity. Because no comparison group was established for mothers of term children, however, this assertion cannot be affirmed from the study.",

Their findings confirmed previous findings with regard to prematurity and LBW. Asthmatic children had significantly lower birth weights and gestational ages than nonasthmatic children and were more likely to have required positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) after birth. The risk of asthma was increased more than three times for children receiving PPV after birth. However, the increased risk of asthma due to LBW and prematurity was not significant when maternal history of asthma, bronchiolitis, lack of prenatal care, low maternal weight gain, and PPV were considered simultaneously.248 This suggests that lung injury and perhaps mechanical ventilation lead to an asthma-like syndrome, rather than LBW and prematurity directly.",

There is uncertainty about the relative effects of specific pollutants compared with the overall toxicity of the air pollution mixture.286 Gent and colleagues investigated the effect of exposure to ozone and particulate matter of 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter (PM2.5) in a U.S. cohort study of 271 asthmatic children.287 Among children using maintenance medication, the level of ozone, but not PM2.5, was significantly associated with worsening of respiratory symptoms and an increase in rescue medication use. Significant associations were not found for children not using maintenance medication. These findings suggest that children with asthma using maintenance medication are especially vulnerable to ozone, even after adjusting for exposure to PM2.5 and at air pollution levels below the EPA air quality standards.",

A meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between NO2, PM10, or SO2 and period prevalence of wheeze and lifetime prevalence of asthma. The review also identified 14 studies of 10 birth cohorts and 11 studies of cohorts recruited during child or adulthood. In these studies, exposures were individualized by modeling, usually to the individual's home address. In contrast to the cross-sectional studies, meta-analysis revealed associations between NO2 and the incidence of asthma (OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.14; 11 studies) and between PM2.5 and the incidence of asthma (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.02; 5 studies). The COMEAP systematic review concluded that the evidence from the cohort studies is consistent with a significant increase in the incidence of asthma associated with NO2 and PM from traffic sources. The possibilities of air pollution aggravating existing subclinical asthma and residual confounding by factors associated with asthma and residential proximity to traffic were also raised. The disparity between cross-sectional and prospective studies suggests that although the incidence of asthma among those living close to traffic is increased, it is not evident at a population level because of the small effect size and the lack of variation in the distance between home and traffic.",

The incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma was double for children in homes with reported mold odor compared with those that did not. Jaakkola and Jaakkola reviewed the literature on indoor molds and asthma, and they concluded that exposure to molds at home increases the risk of asthma among adults and that exposure to molds at work increases the risk of wheezing.321 They observed that exposure to indoor molds increases the severity of asthma and that removing the source relieves or eliminates symptoms and signs of asthma. Sensitization to mold has been linked to the presence, persistence, and severity of asthma.322, 323 A review of housing interventions designed to improve outcomes concluded that asthma symptoms could be reduced by removing moldy items and eliminating leaks and other moisture sources in homes.324\n",

Smoking adds respirable particles and irritant gases to indoor air, and it represents one of the major sources of fine particles in the air of U.S. homes.332 Exposure of children to particles and gases in tobacco smoke has been documented by measuring personal exposures and using biomarkers that indicate the levels of tobacco smoke components absorbed into the body.333 Cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine, has been extensively investigated in children in relation to parental smoking. Compared with children living in households in which there is no smoking, children living with smokers tend to have substantially higher cotinine levels.332, 333 In the past, exposure to second-hand smoke was widespread. Almost all participants, including nonsmokers, in the 1988-1990 NHANES III had detectable serum cotinine levels.334 Ten years later, NHANES IV showed a dramatic reduction in cotinine levels,335 a trend that has continued.331\n",

These early studies provided evidence of waning of clinical symptoms over time in a substantial proportion of children with asthma. However, most children tended to remain symptomatic. Interpretation of these data is constrained by differences between past and current therapeutic approaches, possible lack of representativeness of children receiving care at a particular clinical facility, and by diversity of the research methods.140 These studies drew the participants from general practices and clinics, and presumably, more severe asthma was represented. Nevertheless, they provide evidence that the prognosis is favorable for some children with asthma, even in an era antedating contemporary therapeutic approaches.",

Children who continued to wheeze up to 6 years of age were more likely to have mothers with a history of asthma and to have an elevated serum IgE levels, suggesting that the early wheezing represented asthma. Children whose wheezing did not persist had diminished airway function in early life but did not tend to have mothers with asthma or elevated IgE levels. The pattern of persistence of wheezing during childhood and into adulthood was similar in a smaller cohort study of 100 children in England, who were followed from birth to age 22 years.373 In this high-risk cohort, early wheezing was not likely to persist, but wheezing at 11 years of age did tend to persist. The results of these studies imply that clinicians should be cautious in labeling all early childhood illnesses with wheezing as asthma, because some children are predisposed to wheeze with respiratory infections because of reduced airway function.",

However, the effect of having asthma on the decline of lung function has been assessed, and there is limited information on the development of irreversible airflow obstruction in persons with asthma (Table 48-6\n). The evidence on asthma and change in lung function over time is inconsistent with some studies showing increased decline in persons with asthma compared with controls and others showing no difference between asthmatics and controls. Peat and Woolcock followed 92 persons with asthma, who were 22 to 69 years old on enrollment, and 186 control participants from Busselton, Australia.383 The asthmatic individuals had lower lung function values at enrollment and the FEV1 declined at 15 mL/yr more in the persons with asthma compared with the controls. Schachter and colleagues384 followed the lung function of 73 persons with asthma and 278 with wheezing. Over a 6-year interval, there was a similar excess loss of FEV1 in the persons with asthma. Ulrik and Lange385 followed subjects over a 5-year period and found that asthmatic subjects had lower baseline lung function values and an excess annual decline in FEV1 compared with nonasthmatics; the excess annual decline was 39 mL in asthmatic men and 11 mL in asthmatic women. Some individuals with asthma appear to eventually develop irreversible airflow obstruction, which has been related to duration and severity of asthma.356, 387 A continuing effect of asthma was found when follow-up was extended to 15 years.388\n",
