First, nature disaster such as earthquake, typhoons, flood and so on was always used as the background or numerical simulation in the past research, such kind of disaster can disrupt the traffic and lifeline systems, obstructing the operation of rescue machines, rescue vehicles and ambulances. But situation in anti-bioterrorism system is different, traffic would be normal and the epidemic situation could be controlled with vaccination or contact isolation. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to combine research on the biological epidemic model and the emergency materials distribution model, and we assume that emergency logistics network is driven by the biological virus diffusion network. Therefore, it has a different structure from the general logistics network. Third, the new hybrid genetic algorithm we designed and applied in this study is different from all the traditional ways, we improved the two-part chromosome which proposed by Carter and Ragsdale [16] , and custom special set order function, crossover function and mutation function, which can find the optimal result effectively.",

Figure 13 .12a represents that ESL 1 increases as the level of demand satisfaction raised. As we can see that it is a piecewise curve. Before demand is completely met, it is an S-shape curve from zero to \u03b1. After that, it becomes a constant, which means the additional emergency supplies cannot improve the ESL. Figure 13 .12b identifies that ESL 2 decreases as the relative total cost increases. When emergency operation cost is minimized, the ESL 2 arrives at its best level of 1 \u2212 \u03b1. Similarly, when emergency operation cost is maximized, the ESL 2 is zero. Our model depicts the problem of location and allocation for emergency logistics network design. The network is a three-echelon supply chain of strategic national stockpile (SNS), RDCs, and affected areas. The core problem is to determine the number and locations for the RDCs.

The coordinates of the SNSs and the affected areas are obtained in advance. The upper bound of RDC number is set to be 8. The cost of operating a RDC is defined as 6760 \u00d7 \u221a s j .

The main contribution of this research is the function of ESL, which considers demand satisfaction and emergency operation cost simultaneously. Our definition of ESL is different from the existing literature and has a significant meaning for guiding the actual operations in emergency response. Future studies could address the limitations of our work in both the disease forecasting and logistics management. For example, the dynamics of epidemic diffusion could be considered and thus our optimization problem can be extended to a dynamic programming model.",
