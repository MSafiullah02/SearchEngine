These included syphilis, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV (originally a nonhuman primate zoonosis). Over time, epidemiologic and other scientific data about risk were examined with the aim of developing (roughly sequentially) overlapping mitigation strategies that included (1) the virtual elimination of paid blood donors in the United States, (2) donor risk education to promote self-deferral, (3) explicit deferral criteria to be applied at the time of the donor interview, and (4) laboratory testing to reduce donation of infectious blood by donors who might have limited understanding of and/or were reluctant to recognize or admit their \u201cbehavioral\u201d risks. The morbid impacts of these historical agents on many thousands of recipients make the disadvantages of reactive approaches obvious\u2014one need not look further than the thousands of transmissions of HIV and non-A and non-B hepatitis (i.e., before the description of HCV) [1]. In part resulting from shortcomings enumerated in the Institute of Medicine report, the US blood community has explored more precautionary and proactive applications of these approaches to the assessment and mitigation of infectious risks in recent decades.",

Testing for human T-lymphotropic retrovirus types I/II (HTLVs) in the United States was another early effort at a more proactive approach to donor screening [5, 6]. Infection with HTLV-I was known to cause acute T-cell leukemia and myelopathy, albeit with low disease penetrance, and infection was present in healthy individuals who would otherwise qualify as donors. Transfusion transmission was documented, but the attendant disease burden was poorly characterized. In the wake of events caused by another retrovirus (HIV), antibody testing was required in the United States in 1988. Controversy about its impact and cost-effectiveness persists [7].",

The reasons are diverse and beyond the scope of this chapter, but a shrinking globe puts pathogens from the sub-Saharan rain forest within 24 h of a blood center in the Northern Plains. Urbanization, especially when combined with poverty and overcrowding, and human changes of and encroachment into diverse ecologic niches change host, pathogen, and vector relationships. Alterations of climate and animal husbandry also affect reservoir, pathogen, and vector distributions. New discovery systems like next-generation sequencing and metagenomics identify potential pathogens in the environment, wildlife reservoirs, and humans (our microbiome), well before disease associations are even considered. Social media via the Internet brings us nearly instantaneous news and speculation about new diseases and outbreaks from anywhere in the world. How do we integrate, or decide not to, the potential threats into our blood safety regime? Our difficult task in the transfusion medicine community is choosing a proactive framework within which to approach emerging infections despite initially incomplete information about their impacts on transfusion safety.",

Precautionary deferrals were required before the recognition of transfusion transmission based largely on the occurrence of TSEs (sporadic CJD, Kuru et al.) in humans, the presence of the vCJD prion in the reticuloendothelial system of apparently food-borne human cases, and a precedent of parenteral transmission of the prion that causes classic or sporadic CJD [13]. These deferrals aim to prevent an adverse outcome that has proven to be very rare, even in the United Kingdom epicenter of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic [14]. The cost has been the ongoing loss of many thousands of donors for residence in and travel to (and transfusion in some) the countries with risk. In addition to difficult donor counseling sessions, the estimates of donor loss ranged as high as 5% in the United States [15, 16]. We will likely maintain them until concerns about theoretical subsequent waves of the vCJD epidemic, largely related to incubation periods associated with polymorphisms in the human prion protein gene, are adjudicated [17, 18].",

Temporary deferral was required if \u201crisk\u201d was present. This was based on the theoretical possibility of asymptomatic viremia and isolation of the virus from tissues outside the respiratory tract, presumably as a result of blood-borne spread. These interventions occurred absent any clinical evidence of parenteral or transfusion risk [25]. SARS-CoV RNA was subsequently found in patient plasma as early as day 2 after onset of symptoms [26, 27], but there are still no data on infectious viremia in the incubation period or among asymptomatic contacts of cases on which to judge the plausibility of parenteral transmission.

However, the use of malaria deferral is clearly an incomplete approach [34], failing to address risks associated with malaria-free areas and from autochthonous transmission in the United States or other non-endemic countries where competent vectors are established (e.g., as has been seen sporadically with dengue in the United States [35]).",

Our response to dengue risk, or lack thereof, is informative of considerations used to address emerging pathogens. It is the most common human arboviral infection in the world (recent estimates suggest that more than 390,000,000 million infections occur annually) [36]. Human infections can range from asymptomatic to a lethal hemorrhagic fever. It is increasing in incidence worldwide, and transfusion transmission has been documented (albeit infrequently) [37\u201339]. Accordingly, dengue was labeled a priority agent in an AABB Transfusion-Transmitted Disease Committee exercise [11]. However, to date, no interventions are being seriously considered in the United States, beyond the requirement that donors be well when they are bled and what is contributed by malaria deferrals. For donors with risk for dengue from travel or outbreaks, who can be identified prior to donation, management strategies that temporarily restrict their donations or use (currently investigational) donor screening tests have been considered or used with variable costs and impacts on the availability of donors [40\u201343]. Recent data, using nucleic acid amplification tests, suggest that the clinical burden after transfusion transmission may be quite modest and not require action [44]. In this study from Brazil, 16 susceptible transfusion recipients of blood from dengue RNA-positive donors were clinically indistinguishable from susceptible controls who did not. Five exposed recipients experienced probable dengue transmissions, and one was a possible infection. Surveillance for the clinical sequelae of transfusion transmission is clearly a priority as the blood community considers the relevance of this virus.",

            "text": "Chikungunya originated in Africa where, historically, it circulated in a sylvan cycle among forest-dwelling Aedes mosquitos and nonhuman primates, with occasional human spillover. Human infection is generally symptomatic but was thought to be benign. However, during the recent pandemic, the occurrence of severe joint pain persisting for many weeks and months was recognized [45]. A mutation in the viral envelope protein allowed its adaptation to and high-level replication in the cosmopolitan vector Aedes albopictus [46]. Subsequently, the virus emerged from Africa as a pandemic that spread across the Indian Ocean, Asia, and the Pacific starting in 2005, reaching the Americas (St. Martin in the Caribbean) in late 2013 [38, 47]. The explosive (attack rate >30%) 2005\u20132006 epidemic on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean was met with suspension of the collection of red blood cells and plasma on the island, their importation from Metropolitan France, and the emergent introduction of pathogen reduction for platelets collected from local at-risk donors [48]. The virus can be transmitted by IV inoculation of monkeys [49]. Modeling exercises suggest a substantial risk of transmission by blood [50, 51]. Donor testing in the Caribbean using nucleic acid tests during 2014\u20132015 identified 0.19\u20130.54% of tested donors to be \u201cRNA-emic\u201d [52, 53]. The positive units were discarded if prospectively tested or de-linked, so recipient outcomes are not available. Internationally, and during its spread in the Americas where more than 2,000,000 cases have been reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 2014 to mid-September 2017 [54], transfusion transmission has been neither recognized nor alleged. No transfusion medicine interventions are planned in the United States beyond continued surveillance. Limited local transmission in South Florida provoked a scaled response depending on the case load, monitoring in conjunction with local public health, addition of travel deferrals for potential exposures in epidemics ex-US, proactive donation quarantine in zip codes with autochthonous cases and callback to assure the donor remained well before components could be distributed for transfusion, and zip code-based staged cessation of collections for local cases beyond a predetermined threshold number [55].",

The infections can be clinically nonspecific, patients ill enough to require transfusion may have multiple sources of fever, and (in the experience of this infectious diseases clinician) febrile patients are generally not asked for a recent transfusion history, i.e., clinical surveillance is passive and limited.

From emergence to September 2017, 2081 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported (82% from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). 21.5% have had no or mild symptoms. 46.8% had severe disease or died [61]. Two imported infections have been recognized in the United States, both in 2014, affecting healthcare workers exposed in Saudi Arabia. The potential for more extensive transmission outside the endemic area is exemplified by the large 2015 outbreak of healthcare-associated infection in South Korea (185 linked cases) where the index patient was a traveler to the Middle East [62]. The ultimate reservoir is not established, but the agent is likely to have evolved in bats and then was transmitted to camels [63, 64]. Direct contact with dromedary camels and consumption of raw camel milk have been suspected epidemiologically to be routes of primary infection and MERS-CoV transmission to humans [65]. Secondary cases are predominantly in healthcare settings in the absence of or with nonadherence to standard infection prevention and control strategies.",

The occurrence of asymptomatic infection is obviously problematic, however [58]. Evidence for viremia is rarely sought but, where evaluated to date, has been confined to severely ill patients. The index patient in a family cluster in Tunisia in 2013 had viral sequences amplified by PCR from serum after more than a week of illness [66]. Another patient, with fatal infection, had sequences detected 4 weeks after onset of the illness, but was not apparently tested earlier [67]. In neither case was infectious virus sought. One hundred ten Saudi blood donors were seronegative for neutralizing antibodies [68], but there are no systematic studies looking for asymptomatic RNA-emia or viremia in higher-risk cohorts such as contacts of cases. The most recent formal WHO MERS-CoV risk assessment includes no mention of a risk from transfusion-transmitted infection [69], nor does the European CDC rapid risk assessment of communicable diseases risk associated with the 2017 Hajj [70]. Given the low number of cases outside of the Middle East, and the apparent requirement for close contact with ill patients for person-to-person transmission to occur (esp. to healthcare workers), it does not appear that specific travel or risk deferrals are appropriate. Continuous monitoring (i.e., systematic \u201chorizon scanning\u201d) for changes in the epidemiology and clinical pathology of MERS to be alert to changes that would suggest some risk of parenteral spread and transfusion risk seems an appropriate response.",

Nipah is an emerging bat zoonosis, which spills over into humans to cause human infections ranging from inapparent to lethal encephalitis. It is an enveloped RNA virus sharing 70\u201390% amino acid homology across regions of the genome with Hendra virus. Nipah emerged in Malaysia in 1998\u20131999 where bats infected swine and the swine infected humans. During that outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness, there were approximately 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths [75, 76]. The clinical spectrum seems variable across geographically separate outbreaks. Treatment is supportive, but the antiviral ribavirin has been used in uncontrolled circumstances with some success. No effective prophylaxis (medication, immunoglobulin, or vaccine) has been reported. The human incubation period has ranged from 4 days to 2 months (90% \u226414 days), and there is, again, some variation according to the location of the outbreak. Direct contact with the respiratory secretions of infected swine that generally have a mild illness (apparently infected by consumption of mangoes contaminated with bat urine) was the source of the index outbreak. Bats of the genus Pteropus (\u201cflying foxes\u201d) appear to be the natural reservoir and can infect a variety of mammalian secondary hosts (i.e., felines, canines, swine, and equines). An outbreak in Bangladesh was associated with the consumption of date palm sap, again contaminated by infected bats. Direct contact with infected bats may also result in transmission. Human-to-human transmissions, including family and healthcare associated, are documented. There is indirect evidence (i.e., lacking virus isolation or nucleic acid tests) of reactivation of latent, chronic infection resulting in recurrent CNS disease and death [77\u201379]. Despite recurrent outbreaks, especially in Bangladesh and India, there have been no allegations of transfusion transmission, and little attention has been paid to implications for blood safety.",

A total of 53 outbreaks of equine respiratory illness involving more than 70 horses have all been confined to the northeast coast of Australia [81]. There is no evidence of the infection before its 1994 emergence after serological studies on a number of vertebrate and invertebrate repository samples. It causes a spectrum of human illness from nonspecific fever to flu-like syndromes to fatal encephalitis, generally as a consequence of spillover from equine infections. Treatment is supportive. No effective prophylaxis is available. The incubation period is from 5 to 21 days from exposure. Transmission to humans occurs mainly after direct contact during the care of sick horses or at the time of their autopsies. In early studies, recipient horses were infected intravenously using homogenates of the spleen and lung from two of the index horses. Postmortem lung, liver, kidney, and spleen from a human decedent were infectious in tissue culture [70].

The task for infectious diseases and epidemiology experts in the blood community is to be sensitive to this inevitability and to spend real effort anticipating which agents of many candidates pose material threats that bear forethought and planning. To that end, the emerging infections subgroup at AABB has engaged in developing a toolkit to guide that process (Fig. 10.3). The most critical activity is \u201chorizon scanning\u201d that daily surveils a spectrum of online and print resources to identify new and emerging human pathogens. These include media reports, professional meetings, organizational and peer-reviewed publications, open source and subscription websites (e.g., ProMED [85], CDC.gov, WHO.int, PAHO.org, and many others), and personal networks. Perhaps difficult element for horizon scanning is effective hemovigilance. This requires of clinicians the routine elicitation of a transfusion history as they establish a differential diagnosis in patients with apparent infections, so that they can ask themselves the four questions we have proposed as critical for imputing blood as a \u201cvector.\u201d",

False alarms will occur when members of the \u201c normal human flora\u201d are discovered. TT virus (an anellovirus) was discovered using representational difference analysis for the amplification of nucleic acids in patients with posttransfusion non-A, B, and C hepatitis [86], causing its brief consideration as a target for interventions in transfusion medicine, but any association of the ubiquitous virus with either transfusion pathology or other illness was eventually refuted. More recently, next-generation sequencing was applied to sera from 204 US patients with acute liver failure of unknown etiology and failed to identify unexpected pathogens [87].",

Online risk modeling tools to accomplish these analyses are being developed for transfusion medicine [88], with the critical, if obvious, caveat that the precision of their output is wholly dependent on input parameters. These are necessarily least precise in the earliest stages of emergence when initial preparedness decisions must be made generally and specifically with regard to transfusion safety. There are critical data needed to inform any quantitative assessment of the importance of a potential pathogen. A \u201croutine\u201d search for and reports of the presence of the infectious agent (or the imperfect surrogates, nucleic acids, and antigens) in the blood of asymptomatic individuals at risk would be a valuable standard operating procedure during epidemiologic investigations of emerging infections; this does not often occur early and before the blood community must respond to a potential threat. Likewise, prospective determination of pathogen survival through contemporary component production, processing, and storage should be a research priority.",
