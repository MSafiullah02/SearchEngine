This resulted in the development of the signaling chain homooligomerization (SCHOOL) strategy to modulate cell responses using receptor-specific peptides. Inspired by nature, these short peptides use ligand-independent mechanisms of receptor inhibition and demonstrate potent efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The SCHOOL strategy is especially important when receptor ligands are unknown. An example is the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) receptor, an emerging therapeutic target involved in the pathogenesis of most inflammatory diseases. Here, I discuss advances in the field with a focus on TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides that offer new hope for a 'magic bullet' cure for cancer, arthritis, sepsis, retinopathy, and other medical challenges.",

As a result, we continue discussing numerous, seemingly unrelated and mostly descriptive but not predictive, models of MIRR triggering (reviewed in [1] ). The most evident example is the T cell receptor (TCR) (Fig. 1) . Multiple models of TCR triggering include kinetic proofreading, serial triggering, serial encounter, conformational, permissive geometry, clustering, segregation, and mechanosensor models (reviewed in [1] ; see also [3] ). However, none of these models explain the mechanisms of TCR triggering at the PPI level, and most are seemingly contradictory. For example, whereas the clustering model cannot explain the existence of TCR oligomers on resting T cells, the conformational model cannot explain why multi-but not monovalent ligands trigger TCR. The failure of the existing models of MIRR triggering to describe and explain the data accumulated to date as well as to predict accurately can be probably explained by the 'Blind men and an elephant' paradigm limitations, when each model considers a different but only one part of the process.",

Nevertheless, researchers considered the observed homooligomerization of the cytoplasmic domains of MIRR signaling subunits [7] as a missing piece of the longstanding puzzle of MIRR triggering and developed a novel, allinclusive platform of MIRR triggering, the SCHOOL model [9] . The main SCHOOL concept is that the similar structural architecture of MIRRs ( Fig. 1 ) dictates similar molecular mechanisms of their triggering. In Fig. 2a , the SCHOOL platform is exemplary illustrated for TREM-1 triggering. Multivalent ligand binding outside the cell induces (or tunes) receptor oligomerization (clustering), which is then translated across the membrane into formation of competent DAP-12 signaling homooligomers in the cytoplasmic milieu, a force that drives transmembrane signaling and is necessary and sufficient to trigger TREM-1 and activate the cell (Fig. 2a) . As mentioned earlier, the importance of ligand-induced oligomerization for TREM-1 triggering (Fig. 2a) predicted by the SCHOOL platform [9, 10] was recently experimentally confirmed [6] , illustrating the predictive power of this platform.",

However, despite extensive studies (reviewed in [1] ), the mechanism of their action remained enigmatic until the SCHOOL model was first introduced and applied to this field in 2004 [9] . Since then, the SCHOOL mechanism remains the only one that is consistent with all data reported so far for these peptides (reviewed in [1] ). For example, no other model of TCR triggering can explain why the peptide GLRILLLKV derived from the TCR-a TMD (Table 1) inhibits antigen-but not antibody-mediated T cell activation [18] (see [1] for more details). Another striking example is that the SCHOOL model is the only one that explains mechanistically why the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo T cell inhibition results observed for the peptides derived from the TMDs of CD3e, CD3d, or CD3g signaling subunits ( [19] , Table 1 ) is not a 'discrepancy' (see [1] for more details). Collectively, these and other numerous examples (reviewed in [1] ) suggest that rationally designed SCHOOL peptides can be successfully used to study multiple aspects of MIRR-mediated cell activation. This is especially important for the studies of those MIRRs that signal through more than one signaling subunit (e.g., TCR and B cell receptor, BCR) because it provides means for modulating specific signals and, as a result, specific cell responses.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock are life-threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2 and common causes of death related to COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICU) [32] . Although most experimental COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines currently aim to block the spread of the viral infection and treat early stages of the disease, therapeutics that slow down the progression from pneumonia to sepsis and ARDS in patients with COVID-19 could reduce the mortality rate in infected risk groups. In patients with cancer, who occupy up to 15% of all ICU beds, the incidence of ARDS is 11.9% of patients with cancer in the ICU, and 17.8% among those on mechanical ventilation [33] . Mortality caused by ARDS in patients with cancer is greater than that of other ICU populations [34] . In experimental ARDS, TREM-1 blockade has been shown to significantly reduce the lung inflammatory response and extend survival [35] , highlighting the potential of TREM-1 as an emerging target for neutrophilic lung inflammation and ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and/or cancer.",

Indeed, when administered short-or long-term at doses up to at least 300 mg/kg, free GF9 was well tolerated by healthy and diseased mice with no toxicity signs and symptoms observed [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Alternatively, cell-specific delivery systems and/or constructs can be used to deliver these peptides to TREM-1-expressing cells, such as macrophages. In this scenario, the intracellularly released peptides (peptide constructs) self-insert into the membrane from inside the cell and colocalize with the TREM-1/DAP-12 receptor complex (Fig. 3, route 2) . Examples include the use of nature-inspired lipoprotein or lipopeptide complexes (LPC) that mimic human high-density lipoproteins (HDL). In contrast to native HDL, which is not normally endocytosed by macrophages, these complexes contain the synthetic 22-mer fragment(s) of the apolipoprotein (apo) A-I molecule, the main protein constituent of HDL, rationally designed and modified to provide targeted delivery of imaging agents and/or drugs, such as TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides (e.g., GF9) to macrophages, enabling the detection and/or treatment of inflammation [41] [42] [43] [44] [46] [47] [48] .",

[50] observed that patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with low TREM-1 expression on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) had more than a three times higher chance of surviving the first 4 years after diagnosis compared with those with high TREM-1 expression. To establish whether a cause-effect relationship underlies these observations, GF9 therapy was tested in experimental NSCLC [41] ( Table 1 ). The data generated in two NSCLC xenograft models in nude mice demonstrated for the first time a therapeutic efficacy of ligandindependent inhibition of TREM-1 in the treatment of cancer. Whereas 5 mg/kg GF9 did not exhibit any therapeutic activity, 25 mg/kg GF9 and GF9-LPC at 5 mg GF9/kg suppressed tumor growth as effectively as 20 mg/kg paclitaxel (PTX) used as a positive control [41] . In addition, this study also demonstrated the utility of xenograft models in nude mice (with intact macrophage function) for studying macrophagetargeted agents.",

Successful use of GF9 therapy in experimental pancreatic cancer [48] further confirmed the pan-cancer nature of the TREM-1 target. All TREM-1 SCHOOL inhibitory formulations used in this study strongly suppressed the tumor growth and extended animal survival in several xenograft models [48] . The longlasting antitumor response to GF9 therapy persisted after treatment and correlated significantly with reduced TAM infiltration [48] . As anticipated, the noncytotoxic TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides were well tolerated during long-term administration when deployed either in free form or formulated into macrophage-targeted LPC for peptide half-life extension and targeted delivery. The study revealed for the first time that, in mice with cancer, TREM-1 blockade using TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides significantly reduced serum levels of IL-1a, IL-6, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1), but not vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a possible contribution of CSF-1dependent antitumor mechanisms to the observed therapeutic activity [48] . Furthermore, in xenograft models, GF9 therapy standalone was as effective as a first-line standard chemotreatment (gemcitabine + nanoparticle albumin-bound PTX, Abraxane; GEM + ABX), whereas, in combination with GEM + ABX, it synergistically suppressed pancreatic tumor growth and increased survival more than threefold over chemotherapy alone (Alexander Sigalov, unpublished observations, XXX Q3 X). Future studies need to elucidate whether TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL peptides synergize with standard cancer immunotherapy (e.g., anti PD-1/PD-L1), which is largely ineffective in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

This indicates that ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibition can be used in the prevention and treatment of retinal neovascular diseases. The study also demonstrated the ability of the TREM-1 inhibitory formulations used to not only cross the BBB, but also to penetrate the blood-retina barrier (BRB). Importantly, TREM-1 blockade using GF9 therapy substantially downregulated retinal levels of TREM-1 and CSF-1 but not VEGF [43] , suggesting that the mechanisms of TREM-1-dependent suppression of pathological but not physiological angiogenesis involve CSF-1. Thus, GF9 therapy can represent a safe and effective alternative to the current VEGF-targeted therapy that is complicated by damage of healthy vessels, potential adverse effects on neurons, rapid vascular regrowth upon interrupting VEGF blockade, and limited effectiveness in some patients.",
