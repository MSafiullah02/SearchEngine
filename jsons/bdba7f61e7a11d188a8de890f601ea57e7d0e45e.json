For the first time, genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10 -8 ) were identified for many common infections. The associations were mapped to genes with key roles in acquired and innate immunity (HLA, IFNA21, FUT2, ST3GAL4, ABO, IFNL4, LCE3E, DSG1, LTBR, MTMR3, TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13B, NFKB1, CD40) and in regulation of embryonic developmental process (TBX1, FGF, FOXA1 and FOXN1). Several missense mutations were also identified (in LCE5A, DSG1, FUT2, TBX1, CDHR3, PLG, TNFRSF13B, FOXA1, SH2B3, ST5 and FOXN1).",

A previous twin study suggested a substantial overlap in genetic factors influencing variations in liability to ear infection and tonsillitis 8 . In our GWASs, we identified the missense mutation (N397H) in TBX1 as a significant susceptibility locus for both. Significant positive correlations were also observed for pneumonia with chronic sinus infections (rg = 0.72, se = 0.19, P = 1.0 x 10 -4 ), childhood ear infections (rg = 0.39, se = 0.07, P = 1.47 x 10 -8 ), colds last year (rg = 0.57, se = 0.12, P = 2.66 x 10 -6 ) and strep throats (rg = 0.69, se = 0.13, P=1.0 x 10 -7 ). These are all upper respiratory infections. The same viruses that cause colds and sore throat (if these infect the throat, sinuses and upper respiratory tract) can also cause pneumonia (if these reach the lungs). We also saw a high genetic correlation between urinary tract infection (UTI) and yeast infections (rg = 0.68, se = 0.08, P = 4.30 x 10 -16 ). There was a phenotypic correlation (Pearson r = 0.41, P < 2.2 x 10 -16 ) among women who reported both UTI and yeast infections in our cohort. These two infections can have similar symptoms and both cause discomfort in vaginal area, but different infectious agents cause them. The genetic correlation from LD score regression removes the correlation in GWAS summary statistics due to the correlation in phenotypes and thus suggests a shared host genetic susceptibility to UTI and yeast infections in females.",

This pathway also includes the ABO gene (indexed by rs8176643, P = 5.81 x 10 -5 ).

Genetic variation in the human FUT2 gene determines whether ABO blood group antigens are secreted into body fluids 16 . Detailed functional annotations of the genes identified in our mumps GWAS are provided in Supplementary table 3. The high-risk allele rs516316 (C) is in complete LD with rs601338 (A), a nonsense variant in FUT2 that encodes the \"nonsecretor\" (se) allele, which has been reported to provide resistance to Norovirus 17 and susceptibility to Crohn's disease 18, 19 and T1D 20 . The surface glycoprotein of mumps virus, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase, attaches to sialic acid receptors and promotes fusion and viral entry into host cells 21 . ABO antigens can modulate the interaction between pathogens and cell surface sialic acid receptors 22 ; this presents a plausible mechanism by which secretor status could modify susceptibility to mumps infections.

Most yeast infections are caused by species of Candida, often Candida albicans. We found GWS associations between yeast infections and variants in DSG1 (rs200520431, P = 1.87 x 10 -16 ). The index SNP rs200520431 is intronic and in high LD (r 2 > 0.8) with multiple missense mutations (rs8091003, rs8091117, rs16961689, rs61730306, rs34302455) in DSG1. The DSG1 gene product is a calciumbinding transmembrane glycoprotein component of desmosomes in vertebrate epithelial cells. It connects the cell surface to the keratin cytoskeleton and plays a key role in maintaining epidermal integrity and barrier function 49 . This glycoprotein has been identified as the autoantigen of the autoimmune skin blistering disease pemphigus foliaceus 50 and homozygous mutations in DSG1 have been showed to result in severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting syndrome 49 . A variant downstream of PRKCH (indexed by rs2251260, P = 3.46 x 10 -10 ) was also significantly associated with yeast infections. None of the variants within 500kb and in moderate LD (r 2 > 0.6) with the index SNP rs2251260 were coding, nor were they reported as an eQTL. However, rs2251260 falls within strong enhancers defined in hepatocellular carcinoma. PRKCH is a member of a family of serine-and threonine-specific protein kinase and is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues. The PRKCH protein kinase can regulate keratinocyte differentiation 51 . We also found a significant association with a variant in the 14q32.2 gene desert (rs7161578-T, p = 4.04 x 10 -8 ).

The 'Intestinal immune network for IgA production' pathway was also identified as the most significant pathway in a recent GWAS of IgAN 63 . In that study, they also linked the intestinal mucosal inflammatory disorders and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with risk of IgAN. Our tonsillectomy GWAS showed significant overlap of the identified loci with those autoimmune and inflammatory disorders 64 .

The bacterial diseases -specifically having a positive TB test (caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis), scarlet fever (caused by GAS), and childhood ear infection (mostly caused by bacteria)were mainly associated with variation in class II molecules. Tonsillectomy and pneumonia, caused by either bacteria or viruses, were associated with both class I and class II molecules. These observations are consistent with previous knowledge about antigen presentation; viruses mostly replicate within nucleated cells in the cytosol and produce endogenous antigens that are presented by class I MHC molecules, while bacteria grow extracellularly and are taken up by endosomal compartments where they are processed for presentation by class II MHC molecules 82 . These two intracellular pathways of protein processing may not be completely separate. Activation of CD8+, HLA class I-restricted Tcells by exogenous antigens has been reported 83 and HLA class II-restricted CTLs that recognize endogenously synthesized antigen, such as HBV envelope antigens, have also been described 84, 85 .",

We identify independent associations for each category of variants: SNP, HLA (classical allele) and AA (HLA amino acid), separately using iterative conditional regression. For amino acid polymorphism, the label specifies the amino acid and the position. For example, 'A-Val95' means amino acid Val at position 95 of the HLA-A protein.

The primary response to HPV antigens is more likely to be initiated by the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of squamous epithelia, the Langerhans cells (LCs). LCs capture antigens by macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, and then initiate class II processing of exogenous antigens 87 , which explains why our plantar warts GWAS mainly identified associations with MHC class II molecules. In other cases, our results suggest even more complex interactions. Strep throat (caused by GAS bacteria) has both MHC class I and class II associations.

The V1 and V2 platforms were variants of the Illumina HumanHap550+ BeadChip and contained a total of about 560,000 SNPs, including about 25,000 custom SNPs selected by 23andMe. The V3 platform was based on the Illumina OmniExpress+ BeadChip and contained a total of about 950,000 SNPs and custom content to improve the overlap with our V2 array. The V4 platform in current use is a fully custom array of about 950,000 SNPs and includes a lower redundancy subset of V2 and V3 SNPs with additional coverage of lower-frequency coding variation. Samples that failed to reach 98.5% call rate were re-analyzed. Individuals whose analyses failed repeatedly were re-contacted by 23andMe customer service to provide additional samples, as is done for all 23andMe customers.Participant genotype data were imputed using the March 2012 \"v3\" release of the 1000 Genomes Project reference haplotypes 96 . We phased and imputed data for each genotyping platform separately. First, we used BEAGLE 97 (version 3.3.1) to phase batches of 8,000 to 9,000 individuals across chromosomal segments of no more than 10,000 genotyped SNPs, with overlaps of 200 SNPs. We excluded SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u221220 , call rate < 95%, or large allele frequency discrepancies compared to the European 1000 Genomes Project reference data. Frequency discrepancies were identified by computing a 2x2 table of allele counts for European 1000 Genomes samples and 2000 randomly sampled 23andMe customers with European ancestry, and identifying SNPs with a chi squared P < 10 \u221215 . We imputed each phased segment against all-ethnicity 1000 Genomes haplotypes (excluding monomorphic and singleton sites) using Minimac2 98 with five rounds and 200 states for parameter estimation.",

For example, position 45 of HLA-B protein had five different alleles (E: Glu, M: Met, T: Thr, K: Lys, G: Gly), we first encoded the position using five binary markers, each corresponding to the presence or absence of each allele (e.g. HLA-B-Gly45 tags Gly at position 45 of HLA-B protein). For positions having three or more alleles, we also created markers that tag multiple alleles, each corresponding to the presence or absence of the multiple alleles (e.g. HLA-B-ThrGly45 tags Thr and Gly at position 45 of HLA-B protein). Thus, we created binary indicators for all possible combinations of amino acid variants. We use this naming convention for amino acid polymorphisms throughout this paper.",
