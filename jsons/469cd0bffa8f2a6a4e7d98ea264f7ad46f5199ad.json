Foods that are often touted as healthy are expensive, and many lowincome families simply are forced to do without them.

Additionally, the cultural whiteness of public health campaigns and alternative food movements can inadvertently exclude these communities.",

Black and Latinx workers are over-represented in the lowest-wage sectors of the food industry. Many of these workers are deemed \"essential\" and continue to risk their lives to keep the food system functioning. Major supermarket chains have reported employee deaths, and the soaring rates of infection in meatpacking plants reveals a rampant, industry-wide disregard for the safety of their workforces. People of color are also likely over-represented among Amazon warehouse and food delivery workers, who have had to strike for paid sick leave, sanitization procedures, and basic protections like hand sanitizer. As middleclass consumers' reliance on these services increases, those who perform this \"essential\" work remain unprotected physically, socially, and financially, contributing to elevated infection and mortality rates.",

As food justice scholars have long shown, food insecurity and workplace exploitation are disproportionately experienced by low-income people and people of color not because of poor choices, but because of structural racism and economic inequalities (Laster Pirtle 2020). Now, in the time of this pandemic, we are seeing that we do not have a strong social safety net to assist the large number of food-insecure households, nor do we have work protections to ensure that our lowest paid workers can make it through this crisis safely.",
