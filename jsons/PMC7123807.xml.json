In order to colonize this site, the organism must adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. Early studies demonstrated that K. kingae expresses hair-like surface fibers and suggested that these fibers may be type IV pili, in particular given that they react with antibodies raised against Kingella\ndenitrificans type IV pili. Kehl-fie et al. [1] confirmed that the K. kingae fibers are type IV pili and established that K. kingae type IV pili mediate adherence to respiratory epithelial cells [2]. The density of piliation correlates with three different colony morphologies when K. kingae is grown on solid medium: a spreading/corroding colony type associated with expression of abundant phase variable pili, a non-spreading/noncorroding colony type associated with sparse pili, and a domed colony type associated with no pili [3, 4].",

The main steps in type IV pilus biogenesis are as follows: The major pilus subunit (PilA1 in K. kingae) is translated as a pre-protein, which undergoes cleavage of the signal sequence by a dedicated inner membrane peptidase called PilD [11]. After processing, the mature subunit can be incorporated into the growing type IV pilus fiber by the pilus assembly complex, which contains the cytoplasmic protein PilM, the periplasmic proteins PilN, PilO, and PilP, the inner membrane spanning protein PilG, and the oligomeric outer membrane secretin PilQ [12\u201315]. Pilus extension is powered by ATP hydrolysis by the PilF (PilB in the Pseudomonas type IV pilus nomenclature) cytoplasmic assembly ATPase [16, 17]. Retraction of the pilus through the PilQ secretion is mediated by the PilT retraction ATPase [18, 19].",

Abundant pili are observed emanating from the surface of the wild-type strain (Fig. 1a) and the retraction-deficient pilT mutant (Fig. 1c) but are absent in the pilF assembly mutant (Fig. 1b).

Both of these proteins have similarity to the well-characterized PilC1 and PilC2 pilus adhesins of the pathogenic Neisseria sp. and the PilY1 adhesin in P. aeruginosa type IV pili. However, unlike the PilC proteins in the pathogenic Neisseria sp., the K. kingae PilC proteins share limited amino acid sequence homology, with overall identity of 7 % and similarity of 16 % [2]. Elimination of either PilC1 or PilC2 results in a decrease in K. kingae adherence to cultured human epithelial cells, and elimination of both PilC1 and PilC2 results in a non-piliated phenotype [2, 21]. While there is not yet any direct evidence showing that the K. kingae PilC1 and/or PilC2 proteins mediate direct interaction with host cells, recent studies demonstrating that a K. kingae mutant that is able to express pilus fibers lacking PilC1 and PilC2 is non-adherent suggest that these proteins are the adhesive components of the fiber (Porsch and St. Geme, unpublished data). The host cell receptor for K. kingae type IV pili is currently unknown.",

The N-terminal signal sequence directs the protein through the Sec secretion system into the periplasm. The protein then integrates into the outer membrane as a trimer, with the C-terminal outer membrane domains trimerizing to form a pore. The internal passenger domain is translocated through this pore and is displayed on the bacterial surface. Trimerization of the passenger domain is facilitated by a coiled-coil domain adjacent to the outer membrane pore [25].",

[30] found that approximately 50 % of children with invasive K. kingae disease displayed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, 15 to 20 % had stomatitis, and 15 to 20 % had diarrhea. In agreement with these findings, a study in France found that 19/21 patients with proven K. kingae osteoarticular infection and only 3/8 patients with non-K. kingae osteoarticular infection had at least one respiratory virus present in the oropharynx, including human rhinovirus (12/21), coronavirus OC43 (4/21), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, or 4 (3/21), enterovirus (2/21), or adenovirus (2/21) [31]. Of note, human rhinovirus infection is known to enhance bacterial adherence to respiratory cells and is associated with invasive bacterial infection [32, 33]. Recently, Houmami et al. [34] described a series of five epidemic and four sporadic K. kingae osteoarticular infections between April and October of 2013 in a French hospital. Of the seven patients in this report who were younger than 24 months of age, five had antecedent hand, foot, and mouth disease and two had antecedent stomatitis. Both patients older than 2 years of age did not have evidence of antecedent or concurrent upper respiratory tract viral infection. Further analysis of an 11-month-old with septic arthritis and antecedent hand, foot, and mouth disease revealed the presence of K. kingae DNA in stored joint fluid and coxsackievirus-A6 in a stored stool specimen [34]. These studies strongly support the hypothesis that upper respiratory tract viral infection contributes to the development of K. kingae invasive disease, possibly related to virus-induced damage to the respiratory epithelium.",

The K. kingae RTX toxin is a member of the repeats-in-toxin family and has been shown to be cytotoxic to a wide range of cell types in vitro, including respiratory epithelial cells, synovial cells, macrophage-like cells, and red blood cells [35]. The K. kingae RTX toxin was discovered following the observation that introduction of K. kingae onto a cell monolayer resulted in cell rounding and lysis. A transposon library screen identified a locus with high homology to the Mbx locus in Moraxella bovis that is absent in the less pathogenic Kingella species K. oralis and K. denitrificans [35]. This locus also has high homology to RTX toxins in H. influenzae and N. meningitidis, suggesting that K. kingae acquired the rtx genes through horizontal gene transfer [35]. Testing on a wide range of cultured human cells showed that synovial cells and macrophages are more sensitive to RTX toxin effects than respiratory epithelial cells, although respiratory epithelial cells are still lysed [35]. Additional investigation revealed that the RTX toxin is abundant in K. kingae outer membrane vesicles, which induce cytotoxicity when directly delivered to host cells [36].",

In the Israeli collection of isolates, approximately 96 % of invasive disease isolates expressed either the type a or type b capsule. In contrast, only 70 % of carrier isolates expressed the type a or type b capsule, suggesting that the type a and type b capsule structures may provide a selective advantage for the organism in the bloodstream and contribute to the development of K. kingae invasive disease (Starr, Porsch, and St. Geme, submitted). Given that these initial studies focused on Israeli clinical isolates, further research is necessary to determine the global distribution of K. kingae capsule types.",

When functional pili are present, retraction of these appendages following initial adherence to host cells is thought to displace the polysaccharide capsule, allowing Knh to interact with the host cell and mediate high affinity adherence. A mutant lacking type IV pili but still expressing Knh is non-adherent, presumably because Knh is masked by the polysaccharide capsule. Adherence by this mutant can be restored by eliminating capsule expression, uncovering Knh, and allowing Knh access to host cell receptors [20]. While not demonstrated experimentally, it is likely that the polysaccharide capsule is also able to mask other surface antigens, many of which are smaller than Knh.",

The potential role of the PAM galactan as a virulence factor has not been investigated, but exopolysaccharides from other gram-negative bacteria have been shown to have protective roles during pathogenesis [48, 49].",

            "text": "\nK. kingae can cause uncomplicated bacteremia or can disseminate from the bloodstream to joints, bones, or the endocardium [50, 51]. Analysis of a collection of K. kingae systemic isolates showed that strains recovered from the blood of patients with uncomplicated bacteremia were generally piliated but typically expressed relatively few pili [52]. In contrast, strains recovered from joint fluid samples, bone aspirates, or the blood of patients with endocarditis were generally non-piliated [52]. It is possible that low-density piliation facilitates a tropism for joints, bones, and the endocardium and potentiates an inflammatory response, which in turn selects against piliated organisms. Consistent with this possibility, pili promote efficient adherence to cultured synovial cells. Similar to type IV pili expressed by other pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, K. kingae pili are regulated by a transcription factor called \u03c354 and by the PilS/PilR two-component sensor/regulator system [53]. Mutations in the PilS sensor result in a reduced density of pili, similar to the relative reduction in density of pili observed in isolates recovered from the bloodstream compared to isolates from the posterior pharynx. Mutations in the PilR response regulator completely eliminate piliation, similar to the absence of pili observed in isolates from joints and bones [53]. It is unclear which environmental factors influence the activity of \u03c354, PilS, and PilR and thereby control the density of piliation in K. kingae. The spreading/corroding colony morphology associated with dense piliation, the non-spreading/non-corroding colony morphology associated with sparse piliation, and the domed colony morphology associated with no pili may reflect the relative activity of PilS and PilR [52].",

            "text": "To investigate the role of the host immune system in development of K. kingae disease in healthy individuals, Slonim et al. [54] examined serum IgA and IgG levels against outer membrane proteins in 19 children with invasive disease. As expected, there were significant increases in serum IgA and IgG levels in children convalescing from invasive disease. Further study revealed that the age incidence of disease is inversely correlated with serum IgA and IgG levels in healthy individuals. Infants younger than 6 months of age have undetectable levels of IgA but high levels of serum IgG, suggesting that protection from invasive disease in this age group is due to maternally derived IgG [54]. Children 6 to 18 months of age have the highest incidence of disease and the lowest serum IgG levels [55]. Serum IgG and IgA levels in children 2 years of age and older progressively increase while the incidence of disease progressively decreases, suggesting that K. kingae carriage or exposure in the first 2 years of life may be an immunizing event. However, K. kingae outer membrane protein epitopes have been shown to be polymorphic among diverse strains, raising the possibility of strain specific immune responses that may not prevent recolonization by an antigenically distinct strain [56]. In agreement with these studies, many of the K. kingae surface factors examined to date show strain-to-strain variation, suggesting that immune pressure potentially drives antigenic diversity in this species. The PilA1 subunit of type IV pili is expressed by all piliated strains, yet only 52 % of PilA1 amino acid residues are identical across a collection of clinical isolates [52]. Recent evidence also suggests that there is strain-to-strain sequence diversity in Knh and the PilC proteins (Porsch and St. Geme, unpublished data).\n",
