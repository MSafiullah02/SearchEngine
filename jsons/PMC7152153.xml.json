Although many of these infections have a characteristic appearance on barium radiography, overlap is frequent, thus mandating a definitive diagnosis by other means before prescribing antimicrobial therapy. In addition, some therapies for these disorders (e.g., corticosteroids) may be associated with significant toxicity, further emphasizing the importance of a histologic diagnosis. Last, in patients with severe odynophagia, the barium study may be inadequate because severe pain on swallowing will limit the amount of barium that can be swallowed, thus limiting the quality of the study. For these reasons, endoscopy with biopsy is the preferred diagnostic modality in this group of patients as this will yield a definitive diagnosis in 75% of cases.",

            "text": "AIDS-cholangiopathy is a spectrum of biliary tract abnormalities resembling sclerosing cholangitis that can be caused by a wide array of microorganisms and neoplasms, usually in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. Almost all patients have a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mL and most have a CD4 count less than 50 cells/mL. Patients generally present with epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, fever, and malaise. Although AIDS-cholangiopathy is a cholestatic disease, jaundice and pruritus are uncommon. The most common laboratory finding in this syndrome is a markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase, usually more than three times the upper limits of normal. Typically bilirubin is not elevated and rarely exceeds 3 mg/dL, and transaminases are only mildly elevated. Generally, these patients have a dilated bile duct that is identifiable on abdominal ultrasonography. The diagnosis is best established by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Several cholangiographic patterns have been described, including papillary stenosis, sclerosing cholangitis, combined papillary stenosis and sclerosing cholangitis, isolated intrahepatic disease, and long extrahepatic bile duct strictures. The most common pattern is papillary stenosis with intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is appropriate only for the relief of pain in patients with papillary stenosis. Unfortunately, the disease is progressive and antimicrobial therapy has no influence on its outcome. Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is associated with decreased mortality.",

Pancreatograms at the time of ERCP have shown abnormalities of the pancreatic ducts consistent with chronic pancreatitis. These findings have led many investigators to hypothesize that pancreatic insufficiency from chronic pancreatitis is an important cause of chronic diarrhea in AIDS; however, most cases of chronic pancreatitis are attributable to conditions, such as alcohol abuse. The most common medications associated with pancreatitis in AIDS are pentamidine, ddI, and zalcitabine (ddC). Protease inhibitors frequently cause hyperlipidemia. Ritonavir is associated with the most dramatic increases in triglycerides with 10% of patients developing severe hypertriglyceridemia. Pancreatitis is well described in patients with elevations in triglycerides from protease inhibitors. Reported infectious causes of pancreatitis include CMV, HSV, MAC, and tuberculosis. An infectious cause of pancreatitis is difficult to establish and would require pancreatic biopsy.",

Painful inguinal lymphadenopathy is an almost universal finding. The pain tends to distribute in the region of the sacral roots (i.e., buttocks, perineal region, and posterior thigh). Because of the neural involvement by HSV and the presence of severe pain, patients may complain of impotence and difficulty in initiating micturition. Visual inspection and anoscopy commonly reveal the following lesions: vesicles, pustular rectal lesions, or diffuse ulcerations. HSV is a pathogen of the squamous mucosa; therefore, diffuse proctitis involving the entire rectum is rare. In severe cases, the columnar rectal and sigmoid mucosa has been involved.

The diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhea and negative stool studies ranges from 27% to 37%; CMV is the most common etiology identified. Because CMV colitis is usually present in the distal colon, sigmoidoscopy with biopsy may be a sufficient workup, but in 13% to 39% of cases of CMV enterocolitis, the virus can be detected in the right colon only. Therefore, if CMV is suspected as the cause of diarrhea, a full colonoscopy is warranted, especially if sigmoidoscopy is negative. However, it is still not clear whether colonoscopy has a higher yield than flexible sigmoidoscopy for the detection of organisms other than CMV. Evaluation with colonoscopy would be prudent if sigmoidoscopy is negative and right-sided abdominal complaints are reported. The value of upper endoscopy and small bowel biopsy in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea has also been demonstrated, although specific treatment options for most small bowel pathogens are limited. Some would obtain ileal biopsy at the time of colonoscopy rather than proceed with upper endoscopy and biopsy.

Examples include adenovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, picobirnavirus, and coronavirus. There are also reports that HIV itself can be isolated from enterocytes and colonic cells, but its role in causing disease is uncertain. HSV can cause proctitis that mimics diarrhea because of the rectal mucous discharge.

BPH is caused by an infection with the bacteria Bartonella henselae (formerly Rochalimae) and occurs in patients with advanced AIDS. Patients present with generalized and nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and malaise. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be prominent. Skin manifestations include reddish vascular papules that can be confused with Kaposi sarcoma. On abdominal examination, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are the most prominent features. Histopathology of the liver lesions shows multiple cystic blood-filled spaces within fibromyxoid areas. The treatment of choice is erythromycin for at least 4 to 6 weeks, but doxycycline is a safe alternative.",

With the advent of HAART, the incidence of AIDS wasting has decreased. However, the prevalence of wasting at the time of AIDS diagnosis has increased. The weight loss is typically lean muscle mass, which has a dramatic impact on quality of life. This loss of muscle mass is associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, and impaired functioning. Many strategies have been developed to treat HIV wasting. Nutritional counseling and dietary supplements are effective in increasing fat free mass. Additionally, specific supplementation of l-glutamine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and l-arginine have been shown to increase lean muscle mass. Growth hormone and testosterone increase lean body mass, but these treatments have significant side effects. Some evidence shows anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor therapies increase weight, but these agents present safety concerns in immunocompromised individuals. Resistance exercise provides significant increases in lean body mass as well as strength. Regimens vary, but typically they consist of a three-times-a-week regimen with a clearly defined number of repetitions and percent of maximal output for each repetition. Exercise is inexpensive and without reported side effects and thus is an ideal first-line therapy.",

As HAART has improved the prognosis in HIV/AIDS, significant increases in morbidity and mortality due to liver disease have been observed. HBV and HIV are acquired by similar mechanisms and thus coinfection is common. Patients with coinfection of HIV and HBV have higher HBV DNA levels and are less likely to convert from HBeAg+ to HBeAb+, indicating a poorer response to HBV therapy. Patients with a HBV DNA greater than 2000 and F2 or greater fibrosis on biopsy should have HBV treatment. If a patient has cirrhosis, he or she should be treated if HBV DNA is greater than 200. For patients with a high CD4 count, HBV monotherapy that is not active against HIV should be first-line therapy. When initiating HAART, HBV also should be treated with two antiviral agents active against HBV. If CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/mL, one can elect to treat both HIV and HBV. HAART with two agents active against HBV should be used instead of HBV monotherapy in these individuals.",
