With numerous intrinsic advantages, self-assembling prodrugs possess the maximum drug loading capacity, controlled drug release kinetics, prolonged blood circulation, and preferential tumor accumulation based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. These prodrug conjugates allow for efficient self-assembly into nanodrugs with the potential of encapsulating other therapeutic agents that have different molecular targets, enabling simultaneous temporal-spatial release of drugs for synergistic antitumor efficacy with reduced systemic side effects. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent progress of self-assembling prodrug cancer nanotherapeutics that are made through conjugating therapeutically active agents to Polyethylene glycol, Vitamin E, or drugs with different physicochemical properties via rational design, for synergistic tumor targeted drug delivery.",

Additionally, this amphiphilic drug-drug conjugation approach circumvents the nonuniform biodistribution of individual anticancer agents delivered through cocktail administration and ensures well-controlled temporal and spatial dual drug delivery vital for synergistic cancer elimination.

Following the intracellular delivery, the bioactive component of the delivery carriers can be liberated and cooperate with co-delivered drugs for improved synergistic cancer therapy. [10] Combination therapy with two or more drugs in a single nanocarrier working simultaneously at different molecular signaling pathways can not only maximize the anticancer efficacy, but can also be conducive to overcome drug resistance and counteract the side effects developed by monotherapy.

[73] In addition, EB also exhibits notable antitumor activity in various types of cancers by inhibiting the activity of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). [74, 75] EB has negligible toxicity in normal cells and thereby presents a good safety profile, as XIAP is particularly overexpressed in various drug-resistant cancer cells with a minimal role in healthy cells. Hence, XIAP has been shown to be an effective target for selectively inhibiting cancer cell growth. [76, 77] Additionally through suppressing the NF-\u03baB pathway, EB also has effects of downregulating the expression of several significant cancer promoting factors, such as XIAP, IAP1/2, survivin, cFLIP, TRAF1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-L. [75] However, owing to its long lipophilic acyl chain, EB is extremely hydrophobic, which renders poor aqueous solubility/bioavailability, unfavorable PK and unsatisfactory efficacy.",

            "text": "To address the limitations associated with EB, we developed a series of PEG-dativized EB conjugates, which differ in PEG length and amount of EB, bridging through the aspartic acid-mediated labile ester bond (Fig. 1B) . Upon pegylation, the solubility of EB has been drastically increased from less than 1 mg/mL to more than 750 mg/mL. Equally important, PEG-EB conjugates retain similar cytotoxicity as the unmodified EB in three breast and prostate cancer cell lines. This effect is unlikely due to the polymer-drug conjugate surface activity as PEG-EB showed negligible hemolysis against red blood cells. More strikingly, PEG-EB prodrug not only self-assembles into spherical nanomicelles (~20 nm) in aqueous medium, but can also efficiently encapsulate other hydrophobic drugs such as PTX ( Fig. 1B) within its hydrophobic pocket to achieve synergistic cancer cell killing effect in four different breast and prostate cancer cell lines. This could be attributed to the efficient EB release from the conjugate following intracellular delivery, and consequently synergizing antitumor activity with PTX, which stabilizes the microtubes during mitosis. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the prodrug with two EB molecules and a longer PEG chain is markedly more effective for encapsulating PTX than the counterpart with a 1:1 PEG/EB molar ratio and a shorter PEG chain. [6, 58] This is upheld by the fact that PEG 5K -EB 2 (0.35 \u03bcM) had a much lower critical micelle concentration that that of PEG 3.5K -EB 2 (4.9 \u03bcM) and at the same carrier/PTX molar ratios, PEG 5K -EB 2 showed smaller particle size with lower polydispersity, higher drug loading, and improved formulation stability than PEG 3.5K -EB 2 . The strengthened formulation stability and drug loading in PEG 5K -EB 2 micelles is likely due to the improved PEG stealth effect, which exhibits greater steric hindrance. This prevents the ester linkage from being hydrolyzed under aqueous conditions, resulting in further stabilized micellar nanotherapeutics. Compared to the clinical PTX formulation, Taxol \u00ae , the PTX/PEG 5K -EB 2 micellar formulation displayed a much slower and controlled PTX release as evidenced by the T 1/2 =34.1 h vs T 1/2 =6.57 h in Taxol \u00ae . This delayed and more sustained PTX release from PEG 5K -EB 2 could be attributed to the strong interaction between the carriers and PTX.",

The close proximity of two EB lipidic chain in PEG 5K -EB 2 conjugate can facilitate the interaction of the carrier with PTX. Furthermore, PTX/PEG 5K -EB 2 presented a considerably higher maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as compared to Taxol (100 mg/kg vs 15 mg/kg), which is linked to slow release kinetics for PTX, lower nonspecific uptake by healthy organs, as well as the remarkable safety profile, in addition to the selectivity, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity of EB [6] . The increased MTD and enhanced safety allowed for maximal therapeutic efficacy to be achieved. In addition, PEG 5K -EB 2 was found to be capable of overcoming multi-drug resistance in NCI/ADR-RES cells through inhibiting the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. [10] Furthermore, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in prostate and lung cancer xenograft-bearing mice showed preferential tumor targeting for PEG 5K -EB 2 micelles ( Fig. 1C) . [6, 10] Most importantly, when compared to Taxol \u00ae , the co-delivery of PTX by SAP PEG 5K -EB 2 micelles significantly enhanced tumor reduction in murine models of breast and prostate cancers with no noticeable systemic toxicities (Fig. 1D) .",

[80, 82, 83, 88] Moreover, TPGS-based nanoformulations delivering PTX or other therapeutics exhibited potentiated antitumor activity in several animal cancer models. [81, 82] Nevertheless, the high critical micelle concentration (CMC) value (0.2 mg/mL), renders it unstable in vivo, and unable to serve as an effective nanocarrier to encapsulate therapeutics. [85] In order to improve this drug delivery system, we have developed a number of improved TPGS conjugates by varying the PEG length and altering the ratio of PEG and VE ( Fig. 2A) . Systemic structure and activity relationship study (SAR) demonstrated that all of the optimized prodrugs (PEG 2K -VE, PEG 2K -VE 2 , PEG 5K -VE, and PEG 5K -VE 2 ) retained the intrinsic activity of TPGS in inhibiting P-gp drug efflux pump. [80] Interestingly, PEG 5K -VE 2 outperformed other conjugates in terms of PTX drug loading and formulation stability, leading to the highest level of delaying tumor growth even in comparison to Taxol \u00ae (FDA-approved PTX formulation). While PEG 5K -VE 2 performed best among the four systems, the drug loading capacity (DLC) is still not adequate and within a single digit. To further optimize this SAP system, a fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) drug-interactive motif was installed at the interfacial region of PEG 5K -VE 2 . [7] Fmoc has been shown to provide strong \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking and hydrophobic interactions with other aromatic moieties, including itself (Fig. 2B) . [89] [90] [91] [92] To test this hypothesis, Doxorubicin (DOX) was chosen as the model drug since it has several aromatic rings. Upon Fmoc addition, PEG 5K -Fmoc-VE 2 can physically entrap up to 39.9% DOX, which was a drastic increase over the 2.9% DOX DLC for the PEG 5K -VE 2 , and also higher than most of the existing DOX nanoformulations. [7, 10, 60] Because of reinforced carrier/carrier and drug/carrier interactions, the Fmoc-embedded formulation improved the PK and MTD when delivering DOX in vivo through controlled and sustained drug release, resulting in a prominently increased tumor growth reduction over DOX/PEG 5K -VE 2 and Doxil \u00ae (FDA-approved DOX nanoformulation) in breast, prostate, and drug-resistant murine cancer models (Fig. 2C ).",

[9] CPT-S-S-VE showed significantly higher intracellular (Fig. 4D) and intratumoral drug release (Fig. 4F ) as compared to ester-bonded prodrug (CPT-VE) due to the high glutathione levels inside cancer cells and tumor tissue, [9, 46, 71, 102] which led to the higher anticancer activity both in vitro (Fig. 4E) and in vivo (Fig. 4G) . Both CPT prodrug nanofibers demonstrated greater efficacy over free CPT in curbing breast tumor development in the syngeneic mouse cancer models (Fig. 4G) . While the DLC for free CPT was only 0.65% when using the PEG 5K -Fmoc-VE 2 carrier, it was markedly increased to 9.2% for CPT-S-S-VE with improved formulation stability.",

[9] The VE-derivation has also been investigated for improving the compatibility of other common difficult-to-load drugs with existing carriers. It has been shown that DOX conjugated with D-a-tocopherol succinate (NDOX-TOS) formed a nanoassembly in aqueous solution after mixing with D-a-tocopherol poly(ethylene glycol) 2000 succinate with a much higher DOX DLC (34%) and led to superior tumor growth delay to free DOX. [67] Moreover, a recent discovery has demonstrated that PTX-conjugated VE, bridged via a disulfide linkage, led to spherical nanoparticles with improved PK and enhanced tumor killing effect in vivo as compared to Taxol \u00ae . [103] This approach was realized by the hypothesis that the insertion of a single disulfide bond into hydrophobic molecules can balance the competition between intermolecular forces, resulting in the consequent nanotherapeutic self-assembly.",

The authors demonstrated that the release of free Ir and free Cb was accelerated at weakly acidic environment, indicating potential hydrolysis in the tumor microenvironment. It was shown that the in vitro cytotoxicity of Ir-Cb ADCC was dependent on the critical aggregation concentration (CAC). When the concentration of Ir-Cb ADCC was lower than CAC, it did not produce any significant cytotoxicity. However, at concentration higher than CAC, Ir-Cb ADCC could produce significantly higher cytotoxicity compared to free Ir and ",

The Ir-Cb ADCC nanoparticles were also shown to accumulate to a greater extent in drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells by overcoming P-gp efflux pump. The blood retention time and biodistribution studies demonstrated that Ir-Cb ADCC nanoparticle could circulate for longer time in blood and achieved higher tumor accumulation via EPR effect compared to Ir and Cb (Figs. 5C and 5D). The in vivo antitumor efficacy study in MCF-7 tumor bearing nude mice showed that Ir-Cb ADCC nanoparticles produce highest reduction in tumor volume in comparison to Cb, Ir and Cb/Ir mixture (Figs. 5E and 5F).[27] In addition, Liang et. al. reported a Janus CPT-floxuridine (FUDR, a hydrophilic chemotherapeutics) conjugate (JCFC) where two molecules of CPT were conjugated with two molecules of FUDR to produce a liposome-like nanocapsules (JCFC-NCs) around 115nm in size with spherical morphology.[68] The CPT and FUDR were efficiently released at acidic pH and in the presence of esterase.JCFC-NCs can be internalized into a prostate carcinoma cell line rapidly with a significantly higher antiproliferative effect than free drugs. Moreover, when compared with free drugs and CPT and FUDR mixtures, JCFC-NCs elicited longer blood circulation time, increased tumor uptake, as well as enhanced tumor growth inhibition in prostate cancer.[68] In addition, Xu et al., has developed a supramolecular cisplatin-vorinostat nanodrug that can overcome drug resistance in synergistic cancer therapy.[105] Furthermore, Chlorambucil-Gemcitabine, Methotrexate-CPT, and CPT-Cytarabine ADDC self-assembling nanotherapeutics have been reported for efficacious combination cancer therapy.[106][107][108]",

FTS is a synthetic first-in-class direct Ras antagonist designed to inhibit overactive cell growth in cancers by interfering the anchorage of Ras on cell membrane.[93,94] Nearly one-third of human cancers have constitutive Ras expression.[95,96] By targeting Ras, FTS has shown a noticeable antitumor effect with high selectivity in a wide range of cancers.[97] Similar to EB and VE, FTS contains a long lipophilic acyl chain that gives rise to poor water-solubility/bioavailability. Pegylation not only greatly ameliorates FTS' aqueous solubility, but also enables the formation of nanomicelles that are capable of encapsulating other hydrophobic drugs, allowing for synergistic antitumor efficacy.[98]",

Owing to these merits, a wide variety of SAPs have been developed, which has revolutionized the cancer treatment paradigm in the recent decades. Noteworthily, several aspects that are still needed to be taken into consideration when taking advantage of the SAP systems. First, prodrugs are not biologically active unless the active parent drugs are released. To boost the drug release, conjugation chemistry to anchor suitable linkers (e.g., ester bonds, disulfide linkages, and hydrazone bonds, etc.) should be carefully considered in order to utilize the distinct microenvironment in tumors (e.h., high hydrolase and glutathione levels,",
