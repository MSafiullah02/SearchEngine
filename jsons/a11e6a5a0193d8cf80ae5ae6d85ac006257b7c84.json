This technique is a potential means of assessing brain diseases based on differing rates of water motion in different types of tissue. Most DW imaging pulse sequences in clinical use employ diffusion gradients in three directions (termed isotropic diffusion images). Isotropic DW imaging allows measurement of the rate of water diffusion but does not provide a means to accurately measure directionality of water motion. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a more recently developed form of DW imaging that employs diffusion gradients in at least six directions. This technique allows assessment of water directionality because it provides a rotationally invariant measurement and an approximation of the full diffusion tensor. Microscopic water motion in highly organized tissues (such as cerebral white matter) is anisotropic, i.e., the directionality of water motion varies according to tissue orientation. Therefore, diffusion tensor imaging provides information about the integrity of WM structures. In this lecture, I will explain the principles of DTI and highlight 2 applications.",

The development of diffusion-weighted MR imaging offers the promise of a more sensitive technique for assessment of myelination patterns compared to routine spinecho MR imaging. In particular, DTI appears to provide the ability to more completely and accurately evaluate the white matter maturation process. Using DTI, the MR signal is sensitized to microscopic movement of water molecules. Water motion in myelination WM matter is anisotropic (i.e., has a tendency to diffuse along one direction rather than in all directions), a quality that can be quantitatively and reproducibly measured using anisotropy maps. On such maps, anisotropy is shown to be higher in more compact WM structures (e.g., the corpus callosum) compared to less compact WM structures and gray matter. Anisotropy measurements of WM structures have been shown to increase with age to correspond to the degree of maturation and myelination of the CNS [1] . Therefore, DTI provides a unique marker for WM maturation. It appears reasonable to postulate that DTI could serve as a sensitive means for following changes in WM in diseases in which WM is primarily affected.",

In one study, we compared DTI findings in a small group of Krabbe patients who were treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and untreated children with Krabbe disease [2] . That study compared anisotropy values in various WM regions in three groups: (1) untreated Krabbe children, (2) In another study, we assessed children with Krabbe disease using diffusion tensor imaging prior to stem cell transplantation and after transplantation [3] . Clinical observation had shown us that children who underwent transplantation in the first month of life fared better than children in whom transplantation was delayed by even a few months. We set out to see whether anisotropy values on DTI reflected severity of neurological symptoms. Relatively good correlation between severity of anisotropy decreases and presence or absence of clinical symptoms was seen. Asymptomatic infants had near normal anisotropy values prior to transplantation but symptomatic infants all had decreased anisotropy values prior to transplantation in most WM regions studied. The differences in mean anisotropy values between the two groups were statistically significant for all WM regions studies except the genu of the corpus callosum, in which a normal mean anisotropy value was seen in both groups. These differences likely reflect dysmyelination and failure of myelination in Krabbe disease children during the first few months of life.",

However, it is well established that conventional MR imaging findings do not correlate well with the clinical course, specific pathology, or extent of histologic abnormality. Recent evidence from histologic and MR spectroscopy studies have shown that the pathologic processes in MS involve not only plaques, which are visible on conventional MR imaging, but also involve white matter regions which appear normal. In particular, some of these studies have suggested the possible extension of pathology beyond boundaries of plaques into peri-plaque white matter, which may be distinct from abnormalities in white matter remote from the plaque. The presence of pathologic changes in peri-plaque white is an important issue because quantification of disease burden by imaging is an important surrogate marker for assessing treatment response in trials of therapeutic agents. Therefore, development of new imaging techniques that could improve both sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging would be worthwhile. DTI is a very promising MR imaging advance that provides a potential means to assess important physiologic parameters in MS such as demyelination and axonal loss, which are not directly assessed by standard MR imaging techniques.",

The decreases in anisotropy values in normal-appearing white matter are even more profound than abnormalities found by another technique used to study MS, i.e., magnetization transfer imaging [5] .

In our experience Onyx gives good results and it seems easier to use in comparison with cyanoacrylate. It is injected slowly with an easy and continuous control. The easiest approach that seems possible, using Onyx to embolise brain AVM will probably allow a wider diffusion of these procedures and it is ideal to start this discipline and to train young neuroradiologists.

Takahashi Structures of the region of fourth ventricle and its surroundings involve complex anatomy, which have seldom been identified on magnetic resonance imaging. We attempted detailed identification of this region in normal and pathologic cases. 3D-images showed a general figure of the fourth ventricle. Multiplanar images revealed location of various structures including the fastigium, lateral recesses, posterolateral recesses, cerebellomesencephalic and cerebellomedullary fissures, obex, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, choroids plexus of the fourth ventricle, and adjacent cerebellar structures including nodulus, uvula, pyramis, and tonsils. Supraolivary fossette and the lower end of interpeduncular sulcus between the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles (interpeduncular fossette) could be regarded as landmarks differentiating the inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles and the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, respectively. Also in pathologic cases like Joubert syndrome, identification of anatomy helps in localization and interpretation of lesions or defects. For this report, we retrospectively assessed a frequency, age and sex differences of Virchow-Robin spaces (VRSs) in the midbrain on routine brain MRIs. Materials were images of 494 females and 506 males. A 1.5T imager was used for axial images with 5 mm slice thickness and a 1.5 mm gap. VRSs were identified as linear or oval structures that were hypointense on T1WI and FLAIR, and hyperintense on T2WI. We also assessed visualization of the vessels within the VRSs on 3D-TOF MRA. VRSs were detected in 73, in 49 of the males, and 24 of the females. The frequency was statistically significantly higher for males than for females. No age differences were found. However, these were frequently observed more than 40 years. Some indistinct vessels were detected in the peripheral portion. The VRSs on routine brain MRI need to be taken into consideration for differential analysis of some ischemic lesions.",

This study included 15 patients with gliomas during recent 2 years. In MRS, high grade glioma showed high level Cho, but the territory that showed low level Cho existed in GBM, and this area was accompanied with low level NAA and high level Lac simultaneously. This territory reflected necrosis. In glioblastomas, area of tumors that showed significant enhancement on T1-weighted MR images after administration of contrast material were hyperintense on DWI. We can discover recurrent area early before it is enhanced by DWI every time. Even if perifocal edma enlarge and DWI is high signal, it is highly possible for radiation injury area that shows low Cho, high NAA and high Lac in MRS. We recognaized a case of LA that appeared pattern of way of high grade glioma in MRS, and MIB-1 of this case was 6.3% slightly high. The aim of this study was to determine whether peritumoral ADC values on diffusion weighted imaging are useful for differentiation of brain mass lesions. A total of 25 patients were included in this study. They had glioblastomas in 7 patients, matastatic brain tumors in 7, malignant lymphomas in 6, and brain abscesses in 5. Peritumoral ADC values were measured on a ADC map. The mean ADC values were compared among four tumor groups. Mean ADC values of metastatic tumors and abscesses was significantly greater than those of glioblastomas. There were no significant differences between other tumor groups. Peritumoral ADC values on diffusion weighted imaging were useful for differentiation of some brain mass lesions. Purpose: To investigate feasibility of line scan diffusion-weighted imaging (LSDWI) in the assessment of quantitative diffusion of sellar and parasellar tumors. Method: The MR study was performed in the patients with pituitary adenomas (n=23), meningiomas (n=5), malignant lymphomas (n=3), undifferentiated carcinoma (n=1), and pilocytic astrocytoma (n=1). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured and compared in each tumor type. Results: The ADCs in each tumor type were as follows; 0.81 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b7 10-3mm2/sec in pituitary adenomas, 0.94 \u00b1 0.02 in meningiomas, 0.51 \u00b1 0.08 in lymphomas, 1.36 \u00b1 0.06 in pilocytic astrocytoma, and 1.00 \u00b1 0.04 in undifferentiated carcinoma. Lymphomas showed significantly lower ADC than other tumor types (p<0.01). Conclusion: LSDWI is feasible in the assessment of diffusion of sellar and parasellar tumors. This method may be useful in the differential diagnosis of sellar and parasellar tumors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Turbo Spectroscopic Imaging (TSI) in the diagnosis of brain tumors. TSI may provide 2 dimensional metabolite mapping information and is useful in the diagnosis of tumor infiltration. Thirty-two brain tumor patients have been investigated with Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT with TR/TE=2000/136msec. The results revealed that Cho/Cre ratio in normal brain was 0.2-0.3 and in brain tumor it was over 1. However, in patients receiving radia-tion therapy, the recurrence did not show the same tendency requiring other diagnostic modality. As conclusions, TSI may provide useful information for brain tumor diagnosis. However, the quantification method of each metabolite in TSI should be developed for more detailed analysis in the future.",

Conclusion: Early imaging findings for basal ganglia germinoma are T2 prolongation and T1 shortening on MRI and high density on CT with Waller degeneration. Hemiatrophy and tumor enhancement appear later. The purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of double-phase MDCT over MRI in pituitary macroadenoma. Eighteen consecutive patients with surgically proven macroadenoma (9 women and 9 men; mean, 54 years) prospectively and preoperatively underwent double-phase MDCT (including CTA) and MRI (including dynamic study). In the assessment of cavernous sinus invasion, MDCT was superior to MRI in 3, identical in 15, and inferior in 0. In detecting the normal pituitary, MDCT was superior to MRI in 0, identical in 14, and inferior in 4. In visualizing the optic nerve and/or optic tract, MDCT was identical to MRI in 3 and inferior in 15. Sellar floor erosion was detected in 6 by MDCT, but in 4 by MRI. MDCT revealed a coincidental aneurysm in one case. Double-phase MDCT is superior to MRI in the assessment of cavernous sinus invasion and sellar floor erosion as well as in detection of coincidental aneurysm. Purpose: We evaluated whether postcontrast 3D volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) can provide additional information in diagnosing meningioma. Methods: Twelve consecutive cases with histopathologically proven meningioma were included. Postcontrast T1WI and postcontrast 3D VIBE images were obtained. Appearances of adjacent dura mater and dural sinus, and degree of enhancement on these two sequences were compared. Results: In nine of 12 cases there were no significant differences of visualization of thickness of dura mater between two sequences. In the rest two cases, postcontrast 3D VIBE images were superior to postcontrast SE T1WI. In all 12 cases the relationship between meningioma and adjacent dural sinus was more clearly visualized on postcontrast 3D VIBE images. Conclusion: Postcontrast 3D VIBE imaging is superior in the evaluation of adjacent dural sinus. Postcontrast 3D VIBE imaging is equal or superior to postcontrast SE T1WI in the evaluation of adjacent dura mater. The purpose of our study was to investigate the MR findings of angiosarcoma of the scalp retrospectively. This study included ten patients whose MR images or reading reports were available. All patients were examined with 1.5T MR units. MR images revealed tumors in the scalp or thickened galea aponeurotica and occipitofrontal muscles with prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat saturation technique and T2-weighted images with fat saturation technique demonstrated lesions very clearly. MR images showed skull invasion in two patients. We were not able to see the hidden invading tumor by inspection if it had spread into the surrounding subcutaneous fat and subcutaneous muscles. Therefore, the tumor extent was larger on MR images than on the inspections. However, at least two slice orientations were required for better delineation of the tumors. MR imaging was useful in demonstrating the extent of angiosarcoma of the scalp.",

Maehara 2 From January 1998 to date, we treated 102 ruptured cerebral aneurysms (97 patients) by using Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) endosaccular embolization. We reviewed these patients focusing on the clinical and angiographic outcome. Immediate angiographical results are complete occlusion in 58, neck remnant in 22 and body filling in 22. Coil compaction is occurred in 17 aneurysms, necessitating re-embolization in 10. Complications occurred in 11 patients, including aneurysm perforation in 3 (1 symptomatic, 2 asymptomatic) thromboembolism in 6 (1 symptomatic, 5 asymptomatic), and groin pseudoaneurysm in 2. There were no cases of hemorrhage or re-hemorrhage during follow-up period. GDC endosaccular embolization is a safe treatment for cerebral aneurysms with lower incidence of peri-procedural morbidity and mortality. Its stability is not solved, therefore chronological follow-up angiography is mandatory. The hybrid coil, consisting from hydrogel polymer & platinum, is applied to cerebral aneurysm embolization. The hydrogel coil has several features such as 3 times volume expansion after absorbing blood and facilitating property of endothelialization. It can be delivered safely within 4 minutes to aneurysmal lumen. Full expansion of hybrid coil is obtained 20 minutes after exposed blood. The efficacy of hydrogel coil was established in experimental animal model. We have treated three patients using hybrid coil. All patients were treated without any complications followed by complete occlusion of aneurysms. The hydrogel coil proved to be potent tool for embolizing cerebral aneurysm. In two cases of conus medullaris AVM, endovascular intervention failed, and the surgical treatment was performed. In six cases, partial occlusion of 35$80% via embolization were obtained. Radical cure were clinically seen in four cases, and improvement with only minor dyskinesthesia remained was obtained in one case. No clinical improvement resulted in one case. No recurrence of symptoms has been observed during follow-up. (Conclusion): The use of particles has regularly been emphasized for spinal arteriovenous malformation, but in our experience, acrylic glue represents the optimal material for embolization of spinal perimedullary arteriovenous shunts as it offers the best stable results.",

Tsubokawa 1 , H. Kurita 1 , Y. Shiokawa 1 Progress of MRI can perform sinus thrombosis at an early stage in non-invasive compared with before. We presented 23 cases (F: M=13:10). 8-81y/o (mean 56) in sinus thrombosis. A basic disease were followed unknown: 9, hematological disease: 4. Location; SSS: 9, Transverse sinus: 2, cortical vein: 2. Neurological abnormality: 7, loss of consciousness: 4. MRI / MRV can be diagnosed more easily. With others is good prognosis. Of 23 cases, GR; 19 MD 2, D2. CH is 5 cases. Of 23 cases, the treatment of patient with ICH, are craniotomy: 2, thrombolysis: 2. conservative 1. A result is GR1, MD2, and D2. It is problem how treatment in these case. In 8 cases, 5 cases measured a venous pressure. 1-case death. [Conclusion] Although sinus thrombosis, the early diagnosis became possible. In the thrombolysis venous pressure measurement was usefulness. Furthermore, the new instrument is developed, and it may be able to be usefulness. Recent development of stenting for extracranial carotid artery stenosis is outstanding. Issue of restenosis is inevitable in stenting, but few information are available regarding carotid artery at present. We analyzed the follow-up angiography in 42 cases in which follow-up angiography has finished 6 months after the procedure (follow-up period: mean 9.5 months). We have encountered no restenosis more than 50% in diameter. Factors leading to intimal hyperplasia less than 50% stenosis included insufficient initial gain, edge stenosis in kinked lesion, and Easy Wallstent in long lesion. In some cases, spontaneous regression of intimal hyperplasia was observed in successive study after the first 6 months follow-up. Our result indicates that restenosis ratio after carotid stenting seems considerably low, probably less than 5%. Purpose: We evaluated characteristics of echogram, MRA, CT scan and angiogram. We estimated the comparison between those neuroradiological findings and pathohistological findings. Materials and Methods: We performed echogram, MRA, CT scan and angiogram in 25 cases. Endarterectomy was underwent in 7 cases. We evaluated those neuroradiological findings and pathohistological findings of atheroma plaques getting in surgery. Results: In cases having stenosis rate as 50$80%, MRA and echogram had tendency of overestimate of stenosis rate. CT scan and angiogram had same stenosis rate in almost cases. MRI, echogram and CT reconstruction could describe the stenosis rate, shapes and properties of the plaques certainly and those findings conincideted to the phtohistological findings. Conclusion: We should use those neuroradiological evaluation, understandings each characteristics. Post-infarct secondary neuronal degeneration was known as the Wallerian degeneration, and the transsynaptic degeneration, etc. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the DWI signal changes in these degenerations. We retrospectively reviewed 6 patients with post-infarct secondary degeneration. All patients underwent MR study including DWI within 2 weeks after onset. 5 patients showed the Wallerian degeneration (4 patients: corticospinal tract, 1 patients: pons-cerebellar tract) and one patient showed the substantia nigra degeneration after striatal infarction. All secondary degeneration presented the abnormal high signal intensity on isotropic DWI and one lesion was missed on T2WI. The ADC values were decreased in 5 patients. In patients with ischemic stroke, it was important not to mistake DWI abnormality related to secondary neuronal degeneration as additional infarctions.",

We examined the relationship between perifocal edema volume in deep intracerebral hemorrhage patients and outcome. Twenty-one patients with deep intracerebral hemorrhage were studied three times (First MR scan within 72 hours of ICH onset., Second MR scan 7 days later, third MR scan 14days later from ICH onset) by 1.5-T MR imager. We measured hematoma and perifocal edema volumes on T2-weighted images. We statistically evaluated the correlation between modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 4-weeks later from the ICH onset and each volume. First, second and third perifocal edema volumes were better correlation with mRS than hematoma volume. Second perifocal volume (7 days later form the onset) was superior to first and third perifocal volumes to predict mRS. Perifocal edema volume analysis by using conventional MR imaging can predict of outcome in patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage. Subject: The aim of this study is to assess whether the separation of arterial phase (3D-CT arteriography) and venous phase (3D-CT venography) on 3D-CT angiography can be developed. Methods: Six healthy volunteers and twenty-seven patients were studied. The dynamic CT scan was performed to determine the optimal scan timings for arterial and venous phase. Helical scanning using a multi-detector row CT (MDCT) underwent during arterial phase for 5 seconds and veonous phase for 5 seconds after a single bolus injection of contrast medium. Results: In all cases, 3D-CT arteriography and venography were successfully produced. The 3D-CT arterography and venography facilitated the understanding of the anatomocal relation of artery, vein, bony structures and a lesion, providing useful information for surgical planning and orientation. Conclusions: MDCT with a single bolus injection was able to develop the separation of 3D-CT arteriography and venography, providing precise and detailed information on central nervous disorders.",

Sakuma 1 To detect cervical vascular lesions in 15 patients with intracranial cerebrovascular diseases, we performed three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) of the head and neck using multi-detector row CT (MD-CT). All patients received 3ml/sec of contrast medium (total 100 ml) and head and neck were scanned in one session. We obtained excellent intracranial and cervical 3D-CTA in all cases except one. Full evaluation of the carotid arteries from their origin at the aortic arch to the M3 portion of the middle cerebral arteries was possible. Because of the high CT number of the carotid arteries, it was possible to differentiate arteries and veins upon setting a threshold CT number. This method is simple and suitable for screening for vascular lesions of the whole length of the carotid arteries as well as intracranial arteries. Introduction: Basi-parallel anatomical scanning (BPAS)-MRI means heavily T2-weighted thick coronal scanning with grayscale reversal in post-processing, which we designed for visualization of the surface appearance of vertebrobasilar artery within the cistern. Purpose: To calculate the frequency of hypo-plastic unilateral vertebral artery and acquired occlusive disease in the asymptomatic persons. Methods: From April 2003 to September 2003, 90 asymptomatic persons (49 male, 41 female, 30-67, mean 56.7 years) underwent brain MRI, MRA and BPAS-MRI as Brain Check-up Examination in our hospital. Comparing BPAS-MRI with MRA, we differentiated severely hypo-plastic unilateral vertebral artery from acquired occlusive disease. Results: Severely hypo-plastic unilateral vertebral artery was found in 7persons (7.8%). Acquired occlusive disease was proved in 6 (6.7%). Conclusion: Both hypo-plastic unilateral vertebral artery and acquired occlusive disease appeared in similar frequency (about 7%). BPAS-MRI was necessary for the accurate diagnosis in 14% of our series. 2D-MRDSA using spiral sequence (spMRDSA) shows good S/N, and high time-resolution, but still behind IADSA. We employed view-sharing method for spiral sequence, sharing equally divided arm sets, and aimed at enhanced apparent timeresolution in post-processing fashion. We used clinical 1.5T MR scanner in 8 patients with AVM (6), moyamoya (1) , and left MCA occlusion post STA-MCA anastomosis. Arm-shared spMRDSAs (1/6 up to 1/8 frame per sec) were obtained successfully in all the patients. Arm-shared spMRDSA is suitable for demonstrating rapid inflow of cerebral AVM. Whereas, no evident benefits were shown in major steno-occlusive disease. We conclude arm-shared spMRDSA is much effective technique for cerebrovascular diseases, especially for analyzing high-flow pathologic vasculature.",

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated spine MR images obtained for 61 cases (30-91 years old, mean age 68.9) with compression fracture, with paying attention to the signal changes of intervertebral discs adjacent to the compression fracture of the spine using MR imaging. Results: We could analyze 120 compression fractures and 195 intervertebral discs adjacent to the compression fracture. Thirty-nine intervertebral discs showed hyperintense signal on T1WI, while 100 intervertebral discs showed hyperintense signal on T2WI. This signal elevation on T2WI was often found in the border of intervertebral discs. Discussion: Signal changes of intervertebral disc following compression fracture of the spine can be observed frequently. To appreciate this finding is important for the differential diagnosis of discitis. We evaluated the feasibility of tractography of the cervical cord with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a SENSE technique that is less affected by susceptibility artifacts. In three volunteers and 12 patients, we performed DTI of the cervical cord at 1.5T with a single-shot echo-planar sequence in combination with SENSE. We employed a synergy head/neck coil and selected an axial imaging plane. Other imaging parameters were as follows: FOV, 172,5x230 mm; imaging matrix, 112x112; section thickness, 2.5 mm; section gap, 0; number of sections, 60; NEX, 4; and imaging time, 4 min 50 sec. Tractograms were created with a program in image analyzing software (PRIDE, Philips Medical Systems). In each subject, the cord was delineated as a bundle of tracts color-coded in the z-axis. Nerve roots were depicted in variable degrees. DTI using SENSE can be a reliable method for tractography of the cervical cord. Purpose: We applied fiber tractography using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging on the lumbar spinal nerves and peripheral nerves of the lower limbs to assess its feasibility and clinical utility. Subjects and Method: Five normal volunteers and three cases with peripheral nerve pathology were studied by a 1.5 tesla imager using phased-array local coil. Peripheral nerves were tracked down from the proximal segment distally to reconstruct fiber tractography*. Results: In eight out of twelve lumbar spinal nerves, the spinal roots and distal nerve segments were successfully tracked up to a few centimeters in length. The distal plexuses and nerves in the pelvic cavity were not visualized. The sciatic nerves and femoral nerves in the thigh were tracked in all cases. There were cases of lumbar spinal schwannoma and herniated lumbar disk in each of which tractography visualized the relationship of the lesion and the adjacent nerves. Conclusion: MR fiber tractography is feasible for the spinal and peripheral nerves and could add clinically useful information.",

Patients: Among 195 patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for meningiomas at our facilities since 1993, 46 were selected for this study. These 46 patients were followed 3 years or more (max.: 11 years, median; 4 years) and were periodically assessed using CT scans as well as MR imaging. There were 37 female and 9 male patients. Ages at the time of GKRS ranged from 25 to 89 years (mean; 62 years). The tumor was located at the skull base in 25 patients and at other sites in the remaining 21. Results: Significant CT density increases of tumors were demonstrated in 20 (43%) of the 46 patients 3-11 years after GKRS; density increases were not apparent 2 years after GKRS. In most patients, density increases occurred in relation to tumor growth control. The only factor significantly related to increased density was the number of postradiosurgical years (p=.0012). We experienced an autopsy case with a meningioma, in which a postmortem examination was performed 42 months after GKRS. In this patient, sequential follow-up CT scans showed gradual tumor shrinkage as well as remarkably increased tumor density. On postmortem studies, the tumor microscopically showed a diffuse area with numerous psammoma bodies.",

Reduced Cho during 1 day after GKR is considered to be reflection of initial inhibition of membranous function and cell proliferation. Slight elevation of NAA/Cho, and NAA/Cr in 1-2 month after GKR is probably due to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and reduction of tumor size. Normalization of MR spectrum pattern is recognized prior to disappearance of the irradiated tumor.

We performed FDG-PET scan for 15 patients who were the candidate for gamma knife radiotherapy, 7 for diagnosis of recurrence, 3 for evaluation of the effect of therapy, and 5 for detection of primary cancer. FDG-PET indicated the tumor viability well and that help to planning of gamma knife therapy for especially in recurrent lesions. Three of five patients were suspected the primary cancer. FDG-PET is useful for planning gamma knife therapy of the patients with metastatic brain tumor. Purpose: We evaluated the usefulness of contrast-enhance media of ultrasonography (galacutose parmitine acid: Levovist) to visualize the brain perfusion in rabbit. Materials and methods: 6 rabbits were involved in this study. A hole in the skull bone made under anesthesia was used as an acoustic window for the ultrasonography. Ischemic model (3 of 6 rabbits) were made by occluding the MCA with surgical intervention. Harmonic images before and after intravenous injection of contrast media (150mg/ body) were obtained using linear type 5-12Mhz probe. Results: Enhancement of brain perfusion was observed on Harmonic images. Washout was fast and pooling of contrast media was not certain. In ischimic models, hypoperfusion in the occluded side were clearly visualized on Harmonic images. Conclusion: Hypoperfusion of brain in ischemic rat model can be visualized on Harmonic imaging of ultorasonography by using contrast media. Hemodynamics plays very important roles on development and growth of intracranial aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms and carotid stenoses. However, there is no well-established in vivo or in vitro hemodynamics measuring system in human vessels at present. Therefore, we established an in vitro simulator for measuring and visualizing hemodynamics in human vessels, utilizing the following; obtaining multiple 2-dimensional slices including human vessels with the use of a clinical imaging scanner; calculation of 3-dimensional vessel data sets by a computer; production of a realistic hollow silicon vessel model using previous computer data sets and a three-dimensional printing using powders and adhesive; completion of refraction index matching between the silicon model and a mixture of glycerol and distilled water ; whole field measurement of hemodynamics in the model by using particle image velocimetry. This simulator enabled us to obtain tailor-made hemodynamics which were as realistic as possible, in patients' pathological vessels. Plant carbon fibers with Low Electrical Energy are clinically benefit for decubitus and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) by antimicrobial effect. On the other hand, these carbon fibers have several characters, (A) the carbon heater was found to consume less electrical energy than the previous heater, (B) carbon felt jacket protects MR signal and cannot take the MR scan. Our experience strongly suggested that these carbon fibers can be used as a implant (pacemaker etc) protector, a protectorwearing in the Linear Express and cancer relief by using of protection the electromagnetic waves. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the brain MR features and assess the frequency of basal ganglia injury in term patients suffering athetotic cerebral palsy. Method and Material: The subjects consisted of 14 children. Their mean gestational age was 39 weeks and the average birth weight was 3142g. Result: MRI revealed periventricular Hyperintensity in four children, basal ganglia in nine children, and normal in one. The incidences of MRI signal abnormality are 78% in thamalus, 64% in putamen and 28% in globus pallidus. Conclusion: In term children, the basal ganglia injury is demonstrated in 92% patients.

Tada Purpose: It was noted that the patterns of cortical abnormality differed significantly among the affected patients with polymicrogyria (PMG). The purpose was to attempt to clarify the cause of the different imaging appearances. Methods: T2weighted images of 17 patients with PMG (3 days to 43 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Results: T2-weighted images revealed two different patterns: pattern 1, small, fine and undulating cortex with normal thickness (3-4 mm) in 7 patients, all under 12 month-old; and pattern 2, a thick (6-8 mm) bumpy cortex with an irregular cortical-white matter junction in 7 patients over 18 month-old. Serial MR imaging in one patient demonstrated longitudinal changes of the PMG from pattern 1 to pattern 2. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the two appearances (thin and thick) of the cortex likely represent the same process, with the apparent difference being the result of myelination in subcortical and intracortical fibers. We examined cerebral abnormality of patients with abnormality of amino acid metabolism. The subjects were patients of Hypermethioninemia, maple syrup urine diseases, Metylmalonic acidemia and Glutaric aciduria. The T2-WI showed high intensity in the white matter of Hypermethioninemia, maple syrup urine diseases and Glutaric aciduria, but DWI demonstrated high intensity on Hypermethioninemia and maple syrup urin disease but low intensity on Glutaric aciduria. The abnormality of basal ganglia was found on Methylmalonic acidemia and Glutaric aciduria. The quantitative evaluation of proton MRS revealed increased concentration of Cho and mIns on Maple syrup urine disease and Glutaric aciduria. The patient of Glutaric aciduria showed increase of Taurine in the abnormal lesion, but the concentration of Taurine in the blood was kept in the normal level. DWI and proton MRS might be useful to demonstrate abnormality of brain and to conduct differential diagnosis of patients with the abnormality of amino acid metabolism. MR features of acute optic neuritis (AON) include enlargement of the affected nerves, hyperintensities on T2-weighted images and short TI inversion recovery (STIR) technique, and Gdenhancement of the affected nerves. Decrease in ADC has been reported in the affected nerves, although diagnostic value of the diffusion-weighted images (DWI) in AON has not been evaluated. We assessed DWI in 9 patients with AON as well as other MR images. DWI (b = 1000 sec/mm2) were obtained within 2 weeks after the onset of the symptoms. In all patients, hyperintensities were observeed in the affected nerves on DWI. The sites of the hyperintensity were identical to those of Gd-enhancement in 7 patients in whom postcontrast studies were available. In all 6 patients with follow-up MR studies, hyperintensities decreased on DIW obtained 1 to 11 months later. DWI has diagnostic value in AON, especially in cases without Gd-enhancement. Case 1: a 52-year-old male with metastatic cerebellar tumor underwent preoperative cerebral angiography. After the procedure he became disoriented and blind. Emergent angiography showed no arterial occlusion. On the next day CT revealed no infarction in spite of his persistent blindness, and tumor resection was performed. He developed intracranial hemorrhage after the surgery, but his vision gradually improved and entirely recovered within 8 days.",

MATERIALS AND Methods: Axial echo planar T2-weighted MR images of 100 consecutive adult patients were reviewed. MR unit was GE Signa Echo Speed LX CV/i version9.1 (1.5T). Two independent readers attempted to identify the central sulcus using two anatomic methods independently and in combination. The perilorandic hypointensity on echo planar T2-weighted images was compared with anatomically identified central sulcus. Results: Perilorandic hypointensity were seen in 85 cases on the top parietal level, 78cases on the centrum semiovale, 70 cases on the top of lateral ventricle and 60 cases on the corpus callosum and caudate nucleus level. Conclusion: Perilorandic hypointensity on echo planar T2-weighted images is useful to identify central sulcus especially on the lower craniocaudal level. Purpose: We investigated the relationship between the size of the occipital and the transverse sinus. Method: We examined 552 patients who had undergone contrast-enhanced brain MRV using efgre3d with spectral IR. The presence and size of the occipital sinus and the size of the transverse sinus 2cm laterally to the midline were assessed. Result: The occipital sinus was craniocaudally continuous to the sinus or venous plexus in 109 patients. The result showed that, if the size of the occipital sinus is large, the transverse sinus is not so small. Thus, statistically significant relationship could be detected between the size of the occipital and the transverse sinuses. Conclusion: There was no definite relationship between the size of the occipital and the transverse sinuses, so that a large occipital sinus is not always relevant for intracranial venous drainage.",

Takasu We experienced a case of germinoma originated in hypothalamus to basal ganglia preceded panhypopituitarism. Patient was 11 years old boy presenting diabetes insipidus. After 18 months from onset, he showed short stature, and diagnosed panhypopituitarism. MRI obtained at onset showed no abnormal lesion; hyperintensity on T1-weighted image at the posterior part of pituitary was unclear. Hyperintensity lesions in hypothalamus to basal ganglia was recognized on T2-weighted image after 32 months from onset, but no space occupying lesion found in sella turcica. Therefore lesion was exist at hypothalamus, diagnose had delayed due to evaluation performed only pituitary area. Biopsy was performed at basal ganglial lesion. Diagnosis was germinoma with syncytio trophoblastic giant cells. We speculated that hypopituitarism was induced by hypothalamic invasion of germinoma. Introduction: We analyzed whether the detectability of brain metastases (METs) has improved since installation of a new 1.5 T MR unit as compared with the previously used 1.0 T MR unit. Patients and Methods: Among 1156 cases with brain METs treated with gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery at our facility since July of 1998, 376 cases in which MR study covering the whole brain with a slice thickness of 5 mm was performed on the day before GK treatment and MR study with a slice thickness of 2 mm on the day of GK treatment were selected for this study. These cases were divided into two groups. Group A; 253 cases (3126 lesions) examined using a 1.0 T MR unit between July of 1998 and August of 2002. Group B; 123 cases (1171 lesions) examined using a 1.5 T MR unit since September of 2002. Results: One or more lesions invisible on a 5 mm slice study were additionally detected on a 2 mm slice study in 120 cases (47%) in group A and 32 (26%) in group B (p<.0001). Although the minimum lesion volumes detected were 13 cu. mm in the 5 mm slice study and 5.5 cu. mm in the 2 mm slice study in group A, these volumes were 4.3 cu. mm and 3.8 cu. mm, respectively, in group B. Conclusion: For preradiosurgical examination, a 5 mm slice study using a recently developed 1.5 T MR unit appears to be sufficient. The purpose of this study is to reconsider the ''CSF cleft'' sign in meningioma. Fifty meningiomas ware examined. We retrospectively evaluated the rim as the brain-meningioma interface showing the low signal intensity (SI) by T1WIR and the high SI by T2WTSE. In cases with rim, the SI of the rim was evaluated by FLAIR, and the enhancement effect by CE-T1WIR. The characteristics of the rim on the dura-attachment side were also evaluated. In 35 lesions, the rim was observed. The rim was shown as iso-high SI compared to the tumor parenchyma by FLAIR, and was enhanced by CE-T1WIR. In 16 lesions, 2-layer structures with the SI of the rim connecting to the tumor surface and the null SI of CSF were observed by FLAIR on the dura-attachment. We considered that the ''CSF cleft'' sign should be a small area consisting of the dura-attachment site alone.",

Method: Covering about 80 patients for whom differential diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm was made with SSD, images were examined retrospectively, so as to evaluate the usefulness of SSD and its problems in the screening for cerebral aneurysm. The apparatus used was GE Sigma contour. Results: The shape of aneurysm and positional relation of aneurysm to the surrounding blood vessels could be observed in more detail than with MIP. Besides, SSD made it possible to differentiate aneurysm from the branch of blood vessel, the bending of blood vessels, and fenestrated site in some cases. Thus, it was useful.

Hattori Department of Neurology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba Background: Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is complicated with infections and lympohoma, and its pathogenesis is considered as hyper-cytokinema followed by pancytopenia due to hemophagocytosis by macrophages. We experienced a patient with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) following HPS. A Case report: A nineteen-year-old woman who was diagnosed as HPS due to EB virus infection had corticosteroid therapy with benefit. However, during recovery phase of HPS, she complained occipital headache followed by sudden onset visual and consciousness disturbance and convulsions. MRI scans revealed multiple T2 elongated lesions in parietooccipital cortex and subcortex. Her clinical symptoms recovered several days later. MRI scans about a month after showed no abnormalities, and then we made a diagnosis of PRES. Discussion: PRES is known to be caused by hypertension, eclampsia and immunosuppressive drugs, but PRES due to HPS has not been reported yet. Hypercytokinemia due to HPS may induce hyperpermiability of blood brain barrier causing PRES. Purpose: To describe six cases of transient focal splenium lesion. Materials and Methods: Six patients that included three viral encephalitis, two receiving antiepileptic drugs and one with hemolytic uremic syndrome were evaluated. All patients underwent MRI. Five patients underwent diffusion-weighted images. Results: All patients demonstrated focal high signal lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum on T2-weighted images and FLAIR sequence. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging showed markedly restricted diffusion of the lesion in the all five patients which underwent Diffusion-weighted MRI. All five patients received follow up MRI showed complete reversibility of the lesion. Discussion: Although this lesion has been assumed to be vasogenic edema or cytotoxic edema in the previous reports, diffusion-weighted MR imaging showed markedly restricted diffusion and complete reversibility of the lesion in the present cases, suggesting that intramyelinic edema was the main patho-physiological abnormality. We report a focal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging abnormality of the corpus callosum in a patient with depression. A 19-year-old woman presented with depression and antidepressiant therapy was started. T2-weighted MR imaging after 17 days of antidepressant therapy revealed a nonenhancing ovoid hyperintense lesion in the splenium of corpus callosum. The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion weighted MR imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficient was decreased in the lesion. The patient was asymptomatic except for depression, and her neurological examinations were unremarkable. Antidepressant was highly suspected as cause of the lesion.",

Purpose: In the patients with early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression (DP) who complained forgetfulness, we studied difference of cerebral functional changes, using 1H-MRS. Patients & Methods: 26 patients with early stage of AD and 14 patients with DP were carried out. 1H-MRS was performed on a 1.5Tesla MR unit. Volumes of interests (VOI) were acquired in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporoparieto-occipital region (TPO), hippocampus, occipital cortex and cinglar gyrus. Result; In AD patients, it was seen significant decrease of NAA/Cr in the frontal cortex, TPO and cingular gyrus in comparison with normal subjects. On the other hand, in DP patients, it was seen significant decrease of NAA/Cr in only frontal cortex. Conclusion: Those result suggested that there were clearly different pathophysiological changes in AD and DP. Whether patients with schizophrenia associted with idiopathic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert syndrome, GS) have specific changes in brain metabolism was examined on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (proton MRS). This study applied proton MRS in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and vermis of the cerebellum of schizophrenic patients with GS (n=15), without GS (n=15) and healthy subjects (n=15). In the hippocampus, schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of N-acetyl aspartate/creatine-phosphocreatinine (NAA/Cr) and myo-inositol/creatine-phosphocreatinine (mI/ Cr) ratios compared with healthy subjects and the patients without GS. In the basal ganglia, the patients with GS showed a significant decrease of mI/Cr compared with the patients without GS. In the vermis of the cerebellum, the patients with GS showed a significant decrease of mI/Cr compared with healthy subjects. The findings suggest that schizophrenia with GS is a more severe subtype with regard to brain metabolism. The prior knowledge of spectra data can be used for the post processing of MRS signals. The representative programs were MRUI and LCModel, and available by downloading from the web sites. We applied these programs to the same spectra and compared the calculated peak ratios and Cramer-Rao lower bound. MRUI showed some errors on the spectra obtained by short TE, but LCModel could analyse all data with short TE. On the analysis of long TE spectra, the linear correlation (r=0.7-0.9) was found between MRUI and LCModel. The lower bound by MRUI was better than that by LCModel, but the correlation was kept between two methods. The result by two methods was well correlated but MRUI might cause some error for fitting of short TE spectra.",

COACH syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease associates with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, oligophrenia, ataxia, coloboma, hepatic fibroisis, and renal insufficiency. CNS imaging characteristics are similar to Joubert syndrome: the dysplastic vermis with thick horizontal superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP). Absence of crossing of SCP and that of cortico spinal tract (CST) is also reported in the autopsy case of Joubert syndrome but have not been visualized on MRI. 14 y.o. female case of COACH syndrome underwent DTI of MRI. The crossing of SCP was faint on the axial anisotropic diffusion weighed image (DWI) and color map. The left corticospinal tract was not visualized in the ventral pons on the axial anisotropic DWI and color map, and also the crossing of CST was not visualized on the coronal anisotropic DWI (diffusion gradient=perpendicular to the slice). Ganglioglioma are a rare tumor of the central nervous system, representing only 3 percent of primary CNS tumor. Intramedullary location account about 10 percent of cases. We report a case of spinal ganglioglioma. A 51 years old woman admitted our hospital for 7 years history of lumbago. Neurologival examination showed no definite abnormality. Radiography showed dilatation of spinal canal at the lower level of Th11. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural tumor with solid and cystic compotnents. Partial biopsy was performed, and patologic diagnosis was spinal ganglioglioma. Although a few cases were reported, this case was eventually compatible with MR imaging of ganglioglioma. A 76-year-old male with metastatic sacral tumor from hepatocellular carcinoma presented with unbearable low back pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was requested because of failure of narcotics, radiotherapy, transcatheter arterial embolization and local n-BCA injection. CT-guided vertebroplasty with n-BCA injection successfully relieved the patient's pain. Follow-up MRI after the procedure showed no growth of the tumor. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is thought to have a role to control tumor growth and relieve pain. Moreover, local n-BCA injection controlled bleeding effectively during the procedure and could have an additional effect to control the tumor. A new clinical application of percutaneous vertebroplasty is thus presented. The distribution of cements were classified into 3 patterns (1. Trabecular. 2. Solid. 3. Mixed) . We examined the relationship between the distribution patterns and the leakage of cement, and correlated them with MR findings. Results: All vertebral bodies showed acute changes on MRI but often mixed with necrosis and/ or clefts in the same vertebral bodies. Trabecular pattern was seen only in the areas of acute changes. When necrosis or clefts were present, cements tended to show solid distributions, making a mixed pattern. Cement leakage was observed mainly in the vertebral bodies with solid or mixed patterns. Conclusions: Distribution and leakage of cements during vertebroplasty may be predicted from MR findings. Purpose: To evaluate 3D rotational imaging findings for the extent of cement after vertebroplasty, comparing those findings with CT. Materials and Methods: We treated 50 vertebral bodies (42 vertebral bodies were benign and 8 were metastasis) in 35 patients. 3D rotational imaging was performed after finishing injection of cement, then producing volume-rendering (VR) and multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) images. We evaluated the extent of cement, especially focusing on posterior edge of vertebral bodies, foramens, pedicles, disks and veins, then compared those findings with those of CT. Results: CT was superior to 3D rotational imaging with regard to overall image quality. On 3D rotational imaging, MPR images could clearly show the extent of cement. The findings were mostly equivalent to those on CT. VR images were difficult to be evaluated. Conclusion: 3D rotational imaging after vertebroplasty can be performed without any effort to transfer patients and give enough information about the extent of cements.",

We predicted Therapeutic Time Window (TTW) using the PCT. Method: 7 cases studied PCT before thrombolysis form July 2002 to August 2003. These cases were estimated Cerebral Blood flow (CBF), Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV), Mean Transit Time (MTT) using PCT. Result: 3 cases obtained total recanalizaiton. 3 cases obtained subtotal recanalizaiton. A case obtained no recanalization. 2 cases obtained Good Recovery. 3 cases obtained Moderately Disabled. 2 cases obtained Severely Disabled. Discussion: More than 50% CBF, 100% CBV and less than 300% MTT compared with normal side brain of patients have longer TTW. Less than 100% CBV has short TTW. Less than 20% CBF, 100% CBV and more than 450% MTT have very short TTW. Conclusion: PCT is able to predict TTW of super acute phase cerebral ischemia.

Katada Department of Radiology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, AichiWe report two patients with dissecting anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Case 1: A 54-year-old man was presented with sudden onset of severe headache follow by left hemiparesis. CT scan on admission showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the inter- Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) associated with chronic alcoholism is a fatal disorder characterized by demyelination of the corpus callosum. A 62-year-old male Japanese, a heavy drinker for his last over 10 years, was admitted to our hospital because of dysarthria of acute onset. The first MR imaging study showed abnormal signal intensity of the corpus callosum; a diagnosis of MBD was made. After large doses of thiamine injection, his symptom gradually improved. Follow-up MR studies showed reduction of signal intensity abnormalities and residual callosal atrophy. Pathogenesis and therapy of MBD were discussed, and MRI scanning proves to be a highly useful tool for early diagnosis of MBD. We investigated correlations between the hyperintensities on the postmortem T2 weighted images and histologic findings in two autopsy-proven cases of hepatic encephalopathy. In both cases, MR images obtained at several days after the onset showed T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral cerebral white matters and T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globi pallidi, but no signal changes in the cerebral cortices. Postmortem T2 weighted images showed hyperintensities in the bilateral deep and convolutional white matters as well as laminar hyperintensities in the deep cerebral cortices in both cases. Histologically, T2 hyperintensities in the cerebral white matters showed spongiform changes and/or tissue rarefaction, and hyperintensities in the deep cerebral cortices showed laminar spongiform changes (pseudolaminar spongy degeneration) associated with numerous Altzheimer type II glias. These findings were characteristic histologic changes of hepatic encephalopathy. Laminar T2 hyperintensities in the deep cerebral cortices in hepatic encephalopathy, may reflect pseudolaminar spongy degeneration. were obtained from perfusion CT data. The region of interest rate (ROI rate) of CBF and CBV, MTT were calculated from MCA territory of lesion side and ipsilateral. Correlation of each ROI rate and extent of infarct lesion volume on follow up CT was estimated. And then, early CT signs of non-contrast CT in admission were evaluated. Result: The ROI rate of CBF on perfusion maps correlated most strongly with final infarct volumes. The ROI rate of CBF, there was it in the determination which caused broad infarction was equal to or less than 30%. The ROI rate of CBV, there was it in the determination which caused massive haemorrhagic infarction and herniation was equal to or less than 100%. Correlation was not seen in ECS of non-contrast CT in admission and an infarct lesion volume of follow up CT. Conclusion: The ROI rate of a quantitative value in perfusion CT was useful for a prediction of infarct lesion seriousness. It was thought that perfusion CT was useful to exclude adaptation of thrombolytic therapy.",

            "text": "Because CT perfusion is a dynamic study, the contrast media in a blood vessel influences greatly in a measurement result. By decreasing the influence of a blood vessel, it is reported that the measured value by CT perfusion has high correlation with nuclear medicine and Xe-CT using a diffusible tracer, and we analyzed the normal brain blood-flow quantitatively according to age using these methods. Moreover, the increase in the radiation exposure is mentioned as the greatest problem in a CT perfusion. There is almost no report which considered change of the quantitative brain blood-flow by the decrease of S/N or change of radiation quality. We considered change of the quantitative value, advancing reduction of the radiation exposure. It became possible, after keeping quantitative values of a brain blood-flow to the same extent as the conventional conditions, to decrease a dose of radiation exposure about to 1/3. In the context of quantitative functional MRI, baseline deoxyhemoglobin (dHb) content or its equivalent quantity has been indirectly evaluated by use of respiratory CO2 challenge. We present a direct approach based on quantification of the reversible contribution (R2') of the transverse relaxation rate, which allows for mapping of cerebral dHb content without any physiologic challenge or phyiologic assumption. Combined with functional MRI techniques for CBF and BOLD measurements in photic stimulation experiments for human (8 subjects), the change in CMRO2 was calculated to be 18.3\u00b16.7% increase in the primary visual area in parallel to 43.3\u00b115.6% CBF increase. The acute phase of the neonatal classical form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is associated with diffuse brain edema and characteristic MSUD edema. We report a follow up study of a baby with MSUD. The acute phase was seen in the eighth day after birth and the 18th month after birth. Image findings of Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies were really different between these two times. This change thought to be deeply concerned with the progress of myelination. Myelinated area showed a marked decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) compatible with intramyelinic edema. While the unmyelinated area showed an increase in ADC, consistent with vasogenic edema. MSUD edema corresponds to myelinated area of the fullterm baby. On follow-up studies, when neurological findings were normalized, the image findings were almost normal except slight delay of myelination. ADC was thought to be within normal limit. There are many reports of utility of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in diagnosis of abscess. We report a utility of diffusionweighted images in diagnosis of postoprative abscess. Postoperative infection is one of the important complications of surgery. On conventional MR images, postoperative abscess may show atypical finding which is different from general abscess, and its diagnosis may be difficult. We report 5 cases of subacute and chronic postoperative infection. In subacute cases, diffusion-weighted imaging was useful to distinguish abscess formation from reactive fluid collection. In chronic cases of infection to the encapsulated subdural hematoma, diffusionweighted image was able to distinguish abscess formation from organized hematoma. Material and Methods: We analysed the 0 years-old girl with hemimegalencephaly who underwent hemispherectomy for the medical treatment of the refractory epilepsy. As a method, we performed diffusion tensor images before and after the operation, and compared them in various analyses. Result: Fractional anisotropy (FA) in along with transected nerve tracts decreased as compared with the normal side. Conclusion: Child's brain changes dynamically with development. In children, therefore, it is difficult to judge changes by development and changes by the treatment of an operation etc. We wait eagerly for standardization of aging changes of the diffusion image. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical feasibility of semi-automatic ROI analysis using diffusion tensor tractography in the patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 16 patients with ALS (9 limb-onset type, 7 bulbar-onset type) and 9 volunteers were studied. Diffusion tensor imaging (TR6000, TE 78 ms, 13 axes, b-value 1000s/mm2, 128x128 matrix, 2 NEX, 5mm thickness, acquisition time 5.5 min.) was performed by 1.5T MR imager (Signa Lx ver9.0). Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) was visualized by vizDT and Volume-one (original software by Masutani). ROIs were semiautomatically placed on the corticobulbar tract (CBT) and corticospinal tract (CST) and FA values within the ROIs were calculated. Mean FA of ALS patients were significantly lower than that of controls. Mean FA on CBT of bulbar-onset type was significantly lower than that of limb-onset type. DTT could be used to segmentate the white matter tracts for FA analysis. We reported two cases of primary spinal germinoma. Case 1, 35-year-old man with progressive myelopathy from five years ago. MRI showed T2 elongation in the spinal cord at Th6 level without cord enlargement. This year, MRI revealed intramedullary cord tumor at Th6-8 level. Signal intensity on T2WI was iso-or low intensity. At Th9 level, spinal cord was atrophic. Pathological diagnosis was germinoma. Increased serum HCG, Klinefelter syndrome and atrophy with T2 elongation in the left putamen ware found. Case 2, 27-year-old man had Klinefelter syndrome and gait disturbance since five years ago. MRI showed atrophy of the cerebellum. Three years ago, MRI revealed intramedullary cord tumor. Pathological diagnosis was malignant glioma. Two years ago, T2WI showed atrophy of the cerebellum with T2 elongation in the cerebellar white matter. Biopsy of the cerebellum revealed germinoma. Reexamination of pathology recognized germinoma in the specimens of the spinal cord.",

Epidermoid tumors arise from the invagination of epidermal elements into the neural tube at the time of closure of the neural groove during embryonic period. We reported a 14-month-old boy with spinal epidermal inclusion cyst secondary to open myelomeningocle repair. He had been operated just after birth. Preoperative MRI revealed typical open myelomeningocele without intraspinal mass. Twelve months later, follow-up MRI showed a fat-intensity mass with cystic components at the repair site without any neurological symptom. The mass was resected and proved to be an epidermal cyst with lipoma pathologically. Iatrogenic implantation of epithelial cells during myelomeningocele repair is most likely cause. An acquired epidermoid tumor should be considered as a diagnosis when we encounter an intraspinal mass in children after repairing open myelomeningocele. We describe a double microcatheter technique in combination with a balloon-assisted technique to treat two patients with large, dumbbell-shaped intracranial aneurysms for detachable coil treatment. The aneurysms were completely occluded using this technique. One patient could be accomplished this treatment via unilateral femoral artery approach by use of a 7 French guiding sheath. Follow-up studies at 6 months showed good results in both patients.",

Case 1 is 69 y.o. male presenting with intraventricular hemorrhage. Angiography revealed AVM supplied by left PICA with multiple aneurysms on hemispheric branch. Aneurysms are embolized by using liquid material completely but nidus is opacified by left SCA partly. Case 2 is 68 y.o male presenting with SAH. Angiography showed AVM supplied by right AICA with aneurysm located on the brachial loop. Aneurysms are embolized by using liquid material completely, but nidus is opacified by right SCA. Patient suffered from dysphasia due to brain stem infarction. Although embolization of cerebellar AVM with aneurysm is feasible, interventionalist should be familiar with anatomical knowledge. Purpose: To share the clinical experience of spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVM), relatively rare diseases, encountered by a neuroradiologist in a local city. Subjects:11 patients of spinal AVM consecutively experienced by the first author as a interventional neuroradiologist from September 1995 to July 2003, nine men and two women, one to 84 years of age. Results: Four patients were with dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF), seven with perimedullary AVF. Embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was performed as a curative treatment in five patients, and complete obliteration was achieved in four. The other patients underwent surgery alone or after embolization. Complete obliteration was achieved in eight patients, and clinical amelioration was observed in all the patients. Conclusions: With proper selection of treatment modalities and patients, complete obliteration and clinical amelioration could be achieved in most of patients with spinal AVM even in a medical environment in a local city. To determine the safety of intraoperative angiography with a continuous perfusion of a small amount of heparinized saline using a syringe pump through a catheter placed in the cerebral artery. Four patients with brain AVMs and one patient with a brain AVF were examined. Three internal carotid arteries and three vertebral arteries are catheterized. Saline containing 2,000 or 8,000 units of heparin per liter was perfused at a rate of 3mL/hr. The duration of the continuous perfusion ranged from 6 to 9.5 hours. The approximate total volume of the perfused saline was 18 to 29 mL per catheter. The approximate total dose of the perfused heparin was 40 to 230 units per catheter. No complications due to the intraoperative angiography were observed in this study. For intraoperative angiography, a continuous perfusion using a syringe pump through a catheter placed in the cerebral artery would be appropriate. ",
