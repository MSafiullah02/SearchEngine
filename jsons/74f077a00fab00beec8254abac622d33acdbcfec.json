Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP, and they all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern, and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes [3 -10] . We will review the current literature related to CAP patients admitted to the ICU; regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and reasons to admit the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.",

Hospitalized CAP patients carry significant mortality depending on the severity of illness. Several studies have reported a mortality rate of approximately 10 % in hospitalized ward patients, and 30 -60 % mortality in patients who require ICU admission [3, 18] . CAP is burdensome to health care systems as the duration of hospitalization is 6 days at a cost of approximately $7,500 for ward patients compared to 23 days and $21,144 for ICU patients [11, 19, 20] .",

Prior antibiotic use has been defined in the CAP clinical practice guidelines as the use of any antibiotic regime in the past 3 months, and is also associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality [7, 22, 28] . The most common co-morbid illnesses for CAP patients are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is present in up to half of these patients, followed by alcoholism, chronic heart disease and diabetes mellitus (Table 41 .1 shows the risk factors and associated microorganisms) [3, 7, 8, 10, 23 -27] . It is important to point out that approximately one-third of patients with CAP were previously healthy [27, 29] . Elderly and nursing home patients are also at significant risk for CAP and have high mortality rates, although some experts consider pneumonia in nursing home patients as health care associated pneumonia due to the similarities in the etiologic pathogens with hospital acquired pneumonia [22, 28, 30] . Hospitalization rates for pneumonia have increased among US adults aged 64-74 years and aged 75-84 years during the past 15 years. Among those aged 85 years or older, at least 1 in 20 patients were hospitalized each year due to pneumonia [31] .",

This decision is usually made in the outpatient office or in the emergency department, and has implications for the antibiotic class selection, route, and duration of therapy. Two tools have been developed to predict mortality and to determine the site of care for patients with CAP based on the severity of illness, the pneumonia-specific severity of illness (PSI) score and the CURB rule [39 -46]. Fine and colleagues developed the PSI score as part of the pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team Study (PORT) [39] . The PSI is based on 20 parameters including three demographic variables, five The presence of at least one major criterion or at least two minor criteria defines a pneumonia severe enough to require ICU admission ed the modified ATS criteria for severe CAP [3] . These investigators included the presence of one of the two major criteria and/or two out of three minor criteria (Table 41 .5) [42] . Several studies have validated these criteria to admit patients to the ICU and applied them also in other groups of patients including elderly and HIV-infected patients [19, 42, 49, 50, 53, 58, 59] .",

These tests include: complete blood cell count and differential, basic blood chemistry (urea nitrogen and serum creatinine) electrolytes (sodium and potassium), glucose, and liver function tests. Evaluation of the oxygenation by pulse oxymetry or arterial blood gas analysis is extremely important and mandatory [60] . An attempt to obtain samples to identify the likely etiologic agent is indicated in severe CAP patients [61] . However, there is no supportive evidence that microbiological studies will change favorably the final outcome in these patients. Several microbiological tests are recommended in patients with CAP in the ICU (Table 41.6). In addition, other diagnostic markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or procalcitonin have been used as prognostic indicators with variable results [62, 63] .",

All of these guidelines support the concept that the treatment of ICU patients with CAP should be focused on the possible associated etiologic agents [3, 7, 8, 10] . Appropriate, aggressive and early therapeutic approaches including initiation of antibiot- should be covered with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone [3, 6-8, 10, 65] . Mixed infections with typical and atypical pathogens occur in approximately 5 -40 % of cases, and should always be considered, to ensure patients are treated with appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy [3, 6 -8, 10, 56, 66, 67] . In cases in which the infecting pathogen can be identified, directed therapy should be employed [3, 6 -8, 10] . In all clinical series, approximately 40 -70 % of patients with CAP have no pathogen identified [25, 68, 69] . The failure to identify a pathogen has not been associated with a worse outcome, but the empiric regimen should cover S. pneumoniae and atypical pathogens [15, 16] .",

The cost of treating AECOPD is very high, not only because of the economic impact, but also because of the high associated morbidity and early mortality. COPD in the United States annually accounts for 16,000,367 office visits, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 18 billion dollars in direct health care costs [100] . Despite treatment with antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids, up to 28 % of patients discharged from the Emergency Department with acute exacerbations have recurrent symptoms within 14 days [101] and 17 % relapse and require hospitalization [102] . Several investigators have confirmed that relapse is more likely among patients who have lower pretreatment or post-treatment FEV 1 , those who receive more bronchodilator treatments or corticosteroids during visits, and those who have higher rates of previous relapse [103] .",

Furthermore, Allegra, et al. [126] found significant benefit with the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate acid (Augmentin) therapy compared with placebo in patients with severe disease.

This study demonstrated that a significant number of Gramnegative organisms (including E. coli, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa) were identified in their population of patients with severe AECOPD. In addition to supporting the findings of the previously reported studies, this trial demonstrated that treating these pathogens is important for improving outcomes in this high-risk population. The antibiotic-treated group had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate and a significantly reduced length of stay in the hospital compared with the placebo group. In addition, the patients receiving ofloxacin were less likely to develop pneumonia than those on placebo.",

Because treatment with appropriate antibiotics significantly decreases the bacterial burden at 72-h follow-up bronchoscopy, it is speculated that the proper choice of antibiotic reduces the risk of progression to more severe infections, such as pneumonia [115] .

Despite the problems with many of the published antibiotic trials, there are some retrospective trials that emphasize the importance of choosing the correct antibiotic for treatment of patients with AECOPD. A recent retrospective study of outpatients with documented COPD, conducted at our institution, evaluated the risk factors for therapy failure at 14 days after an acute exacerbation [129] . One group of patients received antibiotics and the second group did not. The overall relapse rate (defined as a return visit with persistent or worsening symptoms within 14 days) was 22%. After an extensive multivariate analysis, the major risk factor for relapse was lack of antibiotic therapy (32 % versus 19 %, p < 0.001 compared to the antibi-",

Furthermore, treatment with amoxicillin resulted in a higher incidence of failure, even when compared with those who did not receive antibiotics including amoxicillin, macrolides, and ciprofloxacin (p = 0.006). Although there may be many explanations for these treatment failures, the most likely is that the pathogens were resistant to amoxicillin. This study showed that the use of antibiotics was associated with a significantly lower rate of therapy failure. In contrast to Anthonisen's data [125] , Adams' data show that antibiotics are beneficial regardless of the severity of AECOPD. Furthermore, the patients who received antibiotics, and failed within 14 days, had a significantly higher rate of hospital admissions than those who did not receive antibiotics.",
