A comprehensive genomic 4 characterization of the virus isolates in Turkey is yet to be carried out. Here, we built a 5 phylogenetic tree with 15,277 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-6 CoV-2) genomes. We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in 7 comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic 8 analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. Our 9 results suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first 10 reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most 11 types in the phylogenetic tree. Two of the seventeen sub-clusters were found enriched 12 with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country. Finally, 13 we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements. This analysis suggested 14 multiple independent international introductions of the virus and revealed a hub for the 15 inland transmission. We released a web application to track the global and interprovincial 16 virus spread of the isolates from Turkey in comparison to thousands of genomes 17 worldwide.",

For variations that do not correspond to gap or N, respective 138 7 nucleotides in the reference genome were taken and added to the table to retrieve the 139 associated substitution information.

With this model, we eliminated the 156 variation of rapid changes in clock rates by integration along branches (standard 157 deviation of the fixed clock rate estimate was set to 0.0004). The coalescent likelihood 158 was performed with the Skyline (Strimmer and Pybus 2001) model to optimize branch 159 lengths and dates of ancestral nodes and infer the evolutionary history of population 160 size.

The distribution of subleading migration states and entropies 166 were recorded for each location through Augur trait module (sampling bias correction 167 was set to 2.5). Closest child-parent pairs that do not go beyond their given locations 168 were identified and evaluated as transmissions using Auspice (Hadfield, et al. 2018). Phylogenetic map of the virus subtypes 172 The first COVID-19 case in Turkey was reported on March 10 th, 2020, later than the 173 reported first incidents in Asian and European countries. Since then, the number of 174 cases increased massively. We used all the genomes available in the GISAID database 175 as of May 1 st, 2020 and built a phylogenetic tree. After we filtered out the samples with 176 a lack of information, the total number of samples we eventually used was 15,277. The 177 phylogenetic tree was built with the maximum likelihood method and a time-resolved 178 tree was generated (Figure 1). To verify the accuracy of the phylogenetic tree as well as 179 to assess the distribution of well-characterized genomic features, we mapped several 180 classification schemes on the tree; (i) S/L strain type(Tang, et al. 2020); (ii) D614G 181 type(Bhattacharyya, et al. 2020); (iii) barcodes(Zhao, et al. 2020); (iv) six major 182 clusters. Although the methodologies of the clustering attempts were different between 183 these studies, in general, the previously established groups were in line with our 184 phylogenetic tree. Besides the already established clustering methods, we classified the 185 clades based on the phylogenetic tree only. There are two levels of clustering, as we 186 9 termed phylo-clusters and phylo-subclusters. Small clusters were not taken into account 187 (see Methods). The phylogenetic map of the virus genomes clearly shows the two major 188 S and L strain clades. As the ancestral clade, S-strain is seen as limited in the number of 189 genomes. 29 of the 30 isolates in Turkey are classified in the L-type group.190 191 The samples from Turkey are dispersed throughout the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). The 192 30 samples are classified in 3 out of 4 different phylo-clusters and one is remained 193 unclassified. This dispersion suggest multiple independent introductions to the country. 194 7 of the 30 genomes have aspartic acid (D) at the 614 th position of the Spike protein. The 195 rest 23 genomes have glycine (G) in the same position. Although it was claimed that 196 D614G mutation is becoming dominant because it enables smoother transmission of the 197 virus (Bhattacharyya, et al. 2020) this correlation might simply be the founder effect 198 which is basically the loss or gain of a genetic information when large population arise 199 from a single individual. 200 201 3.2. A transient genome between S and L strain suggests early introduction 202 One of the genomes isolated in Turkey (EPI-ISL-428718) clustered together with the 203 early subtypes of the virus. This genome contains T at the position 8782, which is a 204 characteristic of the S-strain; however, it has T at the position 28144, which implies the 205 L-strain. Therefore, this sample is characterized as neither S-strain nor L-strain by their 206 footprints. In the phylogenetic tree, this genome is placed between S and L strains, 207 which suggests a transitioning genome from S to L strain (Figure 2). The number of 208 variant nucleotides between this sample and root is lower than the other Turkey 209 samples. Phylogenetic placement in the earliest cluster, which is closer to the root, 210 suggests that the lineage of EPI-ISL-428718 entered Turkey as one of the first genomes. 211 By the time this sample was isolated in Turkey, the L-strain had started to spread in 212 Europe, primarily in Italy. Although the isolation date of this early sample is one week 213 later than the first reported case, the existence of an ancestral genome sequence suggests 214 an earlier introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Turkey. 215 216 3.3. Cluster profiles of the samples 217 Turkey has genome samples from at least three of the four major clusters. By taking the 218 transitioning genome into account, samples of Turkey are genuinely scattered in the 219 phylogenetic tree. Based on the groupings applied, we analyzed the distribution of the 220 clusters in Turkey and other countries (Figure 3A). The most samples of Turkey belong 221 to cluster 3. Iran, Denmark and France are also enriched in cluster 3. Unlike China, 222 South Korea, Spain and the USA, cluster 1 (S-strain) sample has not been observed in 223 Turkey yet. Most European countries are enriched in cluster 3. Although Turkey has 224",

The isolated genomes assigned to sub-cluster 4 and 8 231 show higher divergence rates in Turkey compared to the others in the same cluster (p-232 value: 0.00001 and 0.006, respectively). This observation possibly suggests either or 233 both of the two scenarios; (i) the viruses dominantly circulating in Turkey were 234 introduced to the country later than other countries or (ii) this sub-cluster has been 235 circulating in Turkey at a relatively higher rate than other countries and diverged more. 236 237 3.4.

Based on the model, this association is reciprocal. The Europe-275 based introductions are seen as the genomes isolated in Istanbul. Within Turkey, the 276 transmission hub appears to be Ankara (Figure 5B). The isolates in 5 cities are 277 associated with a virus isolated in Ankara (Figure 5C). 278 2793.6. Web application to trace virus transmission280    We have published a web application powered by Auspice 281 (sarscov2.adebalilab.org/latest). We employed the front-end package (Auspice) that282 13 Nextstrain uses (Hadfield, et al. 2018). With increasing number of virus strains, not far 283 from now, it will be infeasible to display the entire phylogenetic tree even in modern 284 browsers. Nextstrain handles this problem by grouping the datasets based on the 285 continents. As the aim of this platform is to trace the spread of virus genomes associated 286 with Turkey, we will use representatives in the phylogenetic tree. The representative 287 sequences will cover all the subtypes. The genomes of the samples collected in Turkey 288 and their nearby sequences will be kept. With this approach, the web application will 289 always contain the genome data from Turkey and necessary information of the subtypes 290 with the representative sequences. An additional dimension we added to the application 291 is that it enables to trace virus across the cities of Turkey. This approach is applicable to 292 create a comprehensive platform for migration analysis for any country or region of are two most abundant lineages of isolates in Turkey: sub-clusters 4 and 8. If the 297 30 samples unbiasedly represent the overall distribution of the strains in Turkey, sub-298 clusters 4 and 8 might comprise approximately 80% of the genomes in the country. More 299 genomes should be sequenced and analyzed to gain more insight into virus evolution. It 300 is essential to continuously follow up on the upcoming mutations when new samples are 301 added to GISAID database.302 303 The phylogenetic analysis of the circulating genomes in a country is necessary to identify 304 the specific groups and their unique mutational patterns. The success of the COVID-19 305 diagnosis test kits, antibody tests and protein-targeting drugs possibly depend on the 306 14 variation of the genomes. If a mutation affects protein recognition, the sensitivity of the 307 test might drastically reduce. Therefore, mutation profiles of the isolates abundantly 308 circulating in the country should be taken into account towards these aims. As 309 international travels are limited, the genome profiles of the countries differ from each 310 other. If international transmissions are kept being restricted, distinct cluster profiles 311 might establish. Therefore, each country might need to develop their specific tests 312 targeting the abundant genomes circulating in local. 313 314 The spread of the virus is traced by the personal declarations and travel history of the 315 infected people. As SARS-CoV-2 genomes spread, they leave foot prints behind 316 (mutations) allowing us to trace them. It is feasible to complement the conventional 317 approach with genome sequencing in an unbiased way. Implemented feature of city-318 based tracing of the virus should be useful for authorities to take necessary measures to 319 prevent spread. This approach will be automated in a standard pipeline. We aim to 320 eliminate the technical limitations (because of the size) by applying filtering methods 321 without losing any relevant information. work, in part, is supported by the European Molecular Biology Organization 325 (EMBO) Installation Grant (OA) funded by The Scientific and Technological Research",
