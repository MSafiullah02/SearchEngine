This was exemplified by the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic and the ongoing outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both these coronaviruses were introduced into the human population following zoonotic transmission, revealing the potentially lethal consequences of nidovirus-induced disease in humans. Within a few months, the emergence of SARS-CoV led to more than 8000 laboratory-confirmed cases (mortality rate of ~ 10%). The MERS-CoV outbreaks thus far resulted in over 2000 confirmed human cases and a ~ 35% mortality rate within that group (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). In addition, the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus and the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are among the leading veterinary pathogens, having caused high economic losses in the swine industry (Holtkamp et al., 2013, Lin et al., 2016). The economic and societal impact of nidovirus infections, and the lack of effective strategies to control them, highlight the importance of advancing our knowledge of the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host cell.",

Their complex genome expression strategy involves genome translation to produce the polyprotein precursors of the nonstructural proteins (nsps) as well as the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs to express the structural proteins (reviewed in de Wit et al., 2016, Snijder et al., 2013). Nidoviral nsps, presumably together with various host factors, assemble into replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) that drive viral RNA synthesis (Gosert et al., 2002, Hagemeijer et al., 2012, Pedersen et al., 1999, van Hemert et al., 2008a, van Hemert et al., 2008b). These RTCs are thought to be associated with a virus-induced network of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membrane structures, including large numbers of double-membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002, Knoops et al., 2012, Knoops et al., 2008, Maier et al., 2013, Pedersen et al., 1999, Ulasli et al., 2010).",

Among these, members of the cyclophilin (Cyp) protein family previously have been implicated in nidovirus replication. Cyclophilins are a family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) that act as chaperones to facilitate protein folding, as well as protein trafficking and immune cell activation (reviewed in Naoumov, 2014; Nigro et al., 2013). Cyclophilins, and in particular the ubiquitously expressed CypA, have also been implicated in the replication of various other groups of RNA viruses. The role of CypA in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection has been studied in most detail. For example, CypA assists HCV polyprotein processing, interacts with HCV NS5A to ensure remodelling of cellular membranes into HCV replication organelles, and stabilizes HIV-1 capsids to promote nuclear import of the HIV-1 genome (reviewed in Hopkins and Gallay, 2015).",

In cell culture, the replication of a variety of coronaviruses and arteriviruses was found to be strongly inhibited by low-micromolar concentrations of CsA and the non-immunosuppressive CsA analogs Alisporivir (ALV) and NIM-811 (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014, Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012, de Wilde et al., 2017a, de Wilde et al., 2013b, de Wilde et al., 2011, Kim and Lee, 2014, Tanaka et al., 2012, von Brunn, 2015, von Brunn et al., 2015). Subsequently, it was established that nidovirus replication can depend specifically on CypA and/or CypB. The replication in cell culture of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV; de Wilde et al., 2013a) and the alphacoronaviruses feline coronavirus (FCoV; Tanaka et al., 2017), human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014), and HCoV-229E (von Brunn et al., 2015) was reported to be affected by CypA knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO), although the level of CypA dependence of these viruses, which was not compared directly, appeared to be quite different. Finally, upon ultracentrifugation, the normally cytosolic CypA was found to co-sediment with membrane structures containing EAV RTCs, suggesting a direct association with the arteriviral RNA-synthesizing machinery (de Wilde et al., 2013a).",

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the CypA-dependence of the replication of three distantly related nidoviruses in the same cell line (Huh7), in which CypA expression was knocked-out using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology (Huh7-CypAKO cells). Using different cell lines, the replication of two of these viruses, the arterivirus EAV (de Wilde et al., 2013a) and the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E (von Brunn et al., 2015), was previously concluded to depend on CypA. The CypA dependence of betacoronaviruses like MERS-CoV has not been documented before. Infection of Huh7-CypAKO cells with MERS-CoV revealed that its replication was only modestly affected by the absence of CypA, as opposed to EAV which was strongly inhibited. Strikingly, and in contrast to a previous report, HCoV-229E replication was not affected at all in the Huh7-CypAKO cells. Our study thus reveals major differences in the magnitude of CypA dependence of the arterivirus EAV when compared to two different coronaviruses, and calls for a more extensive evaluation of the role of CypA in the replication of members of the latter virus family.",

The degree of sensitivity to Cyp depletion appeared to differ between these viruses, but was not compared directly. As we set out to assess the Cyp dependence of the recently emerged MERS-CoV, which had not been evaluated thus far, the fact that this betacoronavirus replicates in Huh7 cells provided an excellent opportunity for a direct comparison with the arterivirus EAV and the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E, which can also replicate in this cell line. Therefore, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, we first generated CypAKO, CypBKO, CypCKO, and CypDKO Huh7 cell pools. To this end, Huh7 cells were transduced with lentiviruses co-expressing the nuclease Cas9 as well as a gRNA that binds a specific sequence in the PPIA, PPIB, PPIC, or PPID gene. CypC and CypD were included given that both these enzymes are also sensitive to CsA treatment (Davis et al., 2010). The fact that it previously was implicated as a host factor in the replication of the betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 (Favreau et al., 2012) was an additional reason to include CypD.",

For the CypCKO or CypDKO cell pools, however, some residual expression of the target gene was detected (\nFig. 1A). Next, the replication of EAV, HCoV-229E, and MERS-CoV in each of the four CypKO cell pools was compared to their replication in Huh7 control cells expressing an unrelated (non-targeting) gRNA. To allow multiple cycles of replication before analyzing virus yields, cell pools were infected with a low infectious dose (MOI 0.01). The production of infectious MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E progeny was found to be unchanged in all four CypKO cell pools (Fig. 1B and C). In contrast, EAV virus titers were reduced by 2-logs after infection of the Huh7-CypAKO cell pool, but not in any of the other knockout cell pools (Fig. 1D). This strengthened the case for an important role of specifically CypA as a host factor in EAV replication. Previously, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CypA expression could only reduce EAV titers by about 4-fold (de Wilde et al., 2013a), suggesting that relatively small amounts of CypA may suffice to support normal levels of EAV replication.",

As the Huh7-CypAKO cell pools might exhibit low levels of residual CypA expression, which might still suffice to support normal levels of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E replication, we generated clonal Huh7-CypAKO cell lines (as described in Material and Methods) for use in follow-up experiments.",

To this end, the exon that was targeted by the PPIA-specific gRNA was PCR amplified using primers targeting the adjacent introns (\nFig. 2D, white triangles) and the PCR product was cloned in a plasmid vector. Per CypAKO cell clone, over twenty plasmid clones were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Remarkably, sequence analysis of these clones revealed six to eight different indel sequences (Fig. 2E; see also below), establishing that these Huh7 clones carried more than the anticipated two copies (alleles) of the PPIA gene. For three out of five cell clones, some of the indels constituted in-frame deletions, indicating that (low amounts of) CypA variants lacking one or more amino acids might still be expressed (data not shown). Two of the Huh7-CypAKO cell clones were found to contain only out-of-frame indels (Fig. 2E, clones #1 and #2), which was supported by a lack of detectable CypA expression (\nFig. 3A). Of note, one of these clones was obtained after lentivirus transduction (clone #1), whereas the other resulted from transfection of the pLentiCRISPR plasmid (clone #2).",

By analogy with the role of CypA in HCV replication (reviewed in Hopkins and Gallay, 2015), and supported by the reduced replication of EAV in siRNA-treated CypAKD cells, we hypothesized CypA to be an integral component of the membrane-associated replication machinery of arteriviruses (de Wilde et al., 2013a; De Wilde et al., in preparation).",

However, the use of a range of nidoviruses and cell lines, and variable experimental set-ups and read-outs likely contributed to these differences. By infecting the same Huh7-CypKO cell pools (Fig. 1) and Huh7-CypAKO clones (Fig. 3) with the three nidoviruses compared in this study, we could now eliminate a number of experimental variables. Our data revealed striking differences between the arterivirus EAV and the two coronaviruses in terms of their sensitivity to CypA-depletion in Huh7 cells. Whereas EAV replication was strongly inhibited (Fig. 3), coronavirus replication was affected only modestly (MERS-CoV) or not at all (HCoV-229E). Interestingly, the relatively small difference in MERS-CoV progeny titers from CypAKO and control Huh7 cells was not observed when infections were carried out with a high MOI (Fig. 3C). A possible explanation for this difference could be the presence of CypA in MERS-CoV virions. Virion-associated CypA has been reported previously for HIV-1 and SARS-CoV (Braaten et al., 1996, Hatziioannou et al., 2005, Neuman et al., 2008), and although its role and importance are unclear, the virion-mediated transfer of CypA to CypA-deficient cells may initially suffice to support efficient replication in these cells. Like SARS-CoV particles, MERS-CoV virions may contain CypA, which could explain complementation of the lack of CypA in knockout cells during a high-MOI, one-cycle replication assay. During a multi-cycle infection experiment, however, the virus produced during the first round of replication may lack CypA, which may negatively influence virus yields during subsequent rounds of replication.",

Consequently, clone #1, in contrast to clone #2, ubiquitously expressed Cas9 and the PPIA-gene directed gRNA.

While EAV replication in cell culture is completely blocked at a dose of 1 \u00b5M CsA, concentrations of 9 and 16 \u00b5M are required to achieve a similar block of the replication of MERS-CoV (de Wilde et al., 2013b) and HCoV-229E (de Wilde et al., 2011, Pfefferle et al., 2011), respectively. An unexpected result was the lack of an effect of CypA depletion on HCoV-229E replication, since a previous study reported a 10-fold reduction of the HCoV-229E-driven expression of a luciferase reporter gene in Huh7.5-shRNA-CypAKD cells (von Brunn et al., 2015). In our hands, however, HCoV-229E replication was unchanged when comparing parental Huh7 cells, Huh7-CypAKO,pool cells, and the two Huh7-CypAKO clones (Figs. 1C and 3C). These contradictory results may (in part) be explained by the use of different viruses (wild-type versus recombinant HCoV-229E), the use of different readouts of virus replication (HCoV-229E progeny titers versus HCoV-229E-driven luciferase expression), or the use of Huh7 versus Huh7.5 cells. The latter is a sub-clone of Huh7 cells that supports HCV replication more efficiently, most likely because Huh7.5 cells express an inactive form of the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), resulting in a reduced antiviral response to virus infection (Blight et al., 2002). Even more striking, is the difference with previous results obtained for two other alphacoronaviruses, FCoV and HCoV-NL63, for which progeny titer reductions of >5-fold and 5-log were reported upon CypA knockdown, respectively (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014, Tanaka et al., 2017).",

The stronger inhibition of EAV suggests that CypA levels in these cells were lower than those in shRNA-expressing CypAKD cells, but due to the nature of the gene editing method used (targeting the PPIA gene instead of the mRNA) CypA depletion could not be readily compared by measuring mRNA levels.

Such structural rearrangements, leading to gene expression abnormalities, are common in tumor-derived cell lines (Lin et al., 2014, Mertens et al., 2015), but are not always taken into account during studies of virus-host interactions. Since Huh7 cells originated from a hepatocellular carcinoma (Nakabayashi et al., 1982), these abnormalities were to be expected, also on the basis of a previous study that established chromosomal imbalances in liver carcinoma-derived cell lines, including Huh7 (Wilkens et al., 2012). Interestingly, this study describes a gain of, among other regions, the part of short arm of chromosome 7 that includes the PPIA gene. Polyploidy and chromosome rearrangements may hamper the generation of bona fide knockout cell lines. Therefore, our observations underline the importance of an in-depth genomic characterization of knockout cell lines obtained by (CRISPR/Cas9-mediated) gene editing. This is further emphasized by the relatively low success rate of our efforts to obtain true CypAKO cell clones, since more gene editing events are needed to achieve complete knockout. Several of our other clones were found to carry in-frame deletions in PPIA and (potentially) expressed CypA variants lacking one or multiple amino acid residues, with unpredictable consequences for the protein's function.",

However, as in the case of CypA, we cannot exclude the possibility that (very) low levels of these Cyps may still suffice to support efficient virus replication. This may be exemplified by the dependence of FCoV on CypB. Whereas FCoV replication in feline CypBKO fcwf-4 cells was strongly reduced, replication in shRNA-mediated CypBKD fcwf-4 cells was only marginally affected, suggesting that a very strong reduction of CypB levels is needed to block replication efficiently (Tanaka et al., 2017). Unfortunately, in the present study, we were unable to generate true Huh7-CypBKO, Huh7-CypCKO, and Huh7-CypDKO cell clones, but the analysis of nidovirus replication in the context of cloned cells lacking these Cyps definitely warrants further efforts. Likewise the quantitative and functional aspects of the role of CypA in nidovirus replication needs to be followed up, particularly in the light of the quite different results that can apparently be obtained with the same coronavirus in different experimental settings.",
