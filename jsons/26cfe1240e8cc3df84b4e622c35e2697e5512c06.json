            "text": "Acute gastroenteritis accounts for a significant burden of medically attended illness in children under the age of five. For this study, four multiplex reverse transcription PCR assays were used to determine the incidence of adenovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, norovirus GI and GII, rotavirus, and sapovirus in stool samples submitted for viral electron microscopy (EM) to the Children's Hospital Colorado. Of 1105 stool samples available, viral RNA/DNA was detected in 247 (26.2%) of 941 pediatric samples (median age \u00bc 2.97 years, 54% male) with 28 (3.0%) positive for more than one virus. Adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, rotavirus, and sapovirus were detected in 95 (10.0%), 33 (3.5%), 8 (0.9%), 90 (9.6%), 49 (5.2%), and 2 (0.2%) of the pediatric samples, respectively. No coronaviruses were identified. Sequencing of norovirus positive samples indicated an outbreak of norovirus strain GII.4 in 2006 with evidence of numerous circulating strains. Multiple samples from the same immunocompromised patients demonstrated symptomatic shedding of norovirus for up to 32 weeks and astrovirus for 12 weeks. RT-PCR detected 99 of 111 (89%) adenovirus-positive samples versus 12 (11%) by EM, and 186 of 192 (97%) sapovirus/astrovirus/ norovirus-positive samples versus 21 (11%) by EM. Noroviruses and adenoviruses are common causes of gastroenteritis in children. Immunocompromised patients can be infected with multiple viruses and shed viruses in their stools for prolonged periods. This data support the superiority of RT-PCR compared to EM for diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis.",

Many laboratories use commercially available immunoassays for the diagnosis of rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus diseases; however, these tests are limited by their ability to detect a single viral pathogen at a time, poor sensitivity and specificity, and limited availability outside suspected outbreaks [de Bruin et al., 2006; Terletskaia-Ladwig et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2009; Mans et al., 2010; Chhabra et al., 2013; Gautam et al., 2013] . Laboratories have been transitioning toward molecular-based techniques like RT-PCR for detection of etiologic viruses in patients with diarrheal illness.",

Overall, 26% of all samples from children with gastrointestinal symptoms showed evidence of viral infection by RT-PCR, similar to what has been reported in most studies using molecular techniques [Esper et al., 2010; Chhabra et al., 2013; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013; Payne et al., 2013] . Of note, viral agents were not detected in 74% of samples, and few samples had bacterial agents identified, suggesting that diarrhea had a non-infectious cause or was due to a pathogen not assessed in this study. Recently, Payne et al. prospectively evaluated the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in children less than 5 years of age for 12 months in three counties in the United States and found that 21% of cases were attributed to norovirus and 12% to rotavirus. When Chhabra et al. expanded this study to evaluate the roles of bocavirus, parechovirus, and aichivirus in acute gastroenteritis in addition to the viruses studied here, viruses were identified in two-thirds of their patients. This increased identification of an etiological agent is likely due to their active surveillance and more comprehensive survey. Additionally, there are reports of diarrhea associated with rotavirus groups B in children in Asia [Sanekata et al., 2003 ] and group C worldwide Kumazaki and Usuku, 2013] , as well as toroviruses [Koopmans et al., 1997; Jamieson et al., 1998 ] in children with gastroenteritis, which were not included in the RT-PCR assay in this study. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that there are likely other, yet to be discovered, viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in children.",

Interestingly, norovirus GII was detected more frequently than rotavirus both prior to and following vaccine implementation, which indicates a significant, continuous burden of disease due to norovirus infections. This correlates with recently published data [Payne et al., 1986 Risku et al., 2010; S\u00e1 nchez-Fauquier et al., 2011] . A significant amount of adenovirus DNA was detected in children with gastrointestinal symptoms, and while other studies have shown variable detection rates of adenovirus 40 and 41 [Colomba et al., 2006; Chhabra et al., 2013 ] the assay in this study was able to detect multiple serotypes in addition to 40 and 41. Only serotypes 40 and 41, and occasionally 18 and 31 have been associated with gastroenteritis. Despite the fact that providers at this institution are discouraged from sending samples for EM unless the patient is symptomatic, the numbers in this study may overestimate the burden of gastroenteritis in children attributed to adenoviruses and could represent asymptomatic shedding of non-enteric adenoviruses with other pathogens responsible for symptoms. Astroviruses have long been known to cause gastroenteritis in humans [De Benedictis et al., 2011; Chhabra et al., 2013] . Recently, however, new astrovirus strains have been discovered and been associated with disease in humans [Zimmerman et al., 2001; Finkbeiner et al., 2008 Finkbeiner et al., , 2009a Hall, 2011; Lindesmith et al., 2011] . The astrovirus protocol used in this study was not designed to detect these novel strains and likely underestimates the true burden of astrovirus disease in these study patients [Phan et al., 2007; De Benedictis et al., 2011] . Surprisingly, in contrast to other studies, very few cases of sapovirus were detected. In other studies, sapoviruses have been reported to cause more vomiting than diarrhea in children, and this study only evaluated stool samples [Chhabra et al., 2013] . Additionally, no cases were associated with the known endemic human coronaviruses. While similar results have been documented in the literature [Esper et al., 2010; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013] , other studies have found endemic coronaviruses and coronavirus-like particles in stool in patients with gastroenteritis [Payne et al., 1986; Risku et al., 2010] . The data from this study supports the hypothesis that known endemic coronaviruses do not cause clinically significant gastroenteritis in children.",

Adenovirus was present throughout the year, while astrovirus, rotavirus, and norovirus GII were present most frequently in the fall and winter months, similar to previously reported data [Zimmerman et al., 2001; Hall, 2011; Chhabra et al., 2013] . The data in this study indicate that there was an outbreak of norovirus GII.4 in this community during the winter of 2006-2007. This observation supports other data which suggests norovirus GII.4 strain is the leading cause of norovirus outbreaks due to its ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic variation, possibly driven by herd immunity [Lindesmith et al., 2011] as well as recombination [Bull et al., 2007; Phan et al., 2007; Unicef WHO, 2009] . These data also support the observation that multiple different strains of [Payne et al., 1986 Wilde et al., 1991; Mitchell et al., 1995; Richardson et al., 1998; Parashar et al., 2003; Wilhelmi et al., 2003; Colomba et al., 2006; Unicef WHO, 2009; Graham et al., 2010; Churgay and Aftab, 2012; Chhabra et al., 2013; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013] . Data from this study indicate that immunocompromised children, in particular those who have received HSCTs, may be infected and shed enteric viruses for up to 8 months and are at risk for persistent symptomatic infection. These findings have significant clinical and infection control implications and complicate the diagnosis of diarrhea in these study patients. Immunocompromised patients might also provide a reservoir for these viruses and a potential environment for recombination events and generation of novel viral strains [Booth et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Hsueh et al., 2004; Schorn et al., 2010] . Furthermore, prolonged infection with enteric pathogens has been shown to put patients at risk for significant sequelae including severe weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and altered intestinal mucosa [Roddie et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2011; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013] .",

Additionally, a significant number of pediatric patients with viral acute gastroenteritis were hospitalized due to gastrointestinal symptoms, and a small number were admitted to the intensive care unit, which indicates these infections can have significant financial impacts.",

At the time these samples were collected and submitted for diagnostic testing, this institution only employed EM for viral testing of stool samples. These results clearly demonstrate that RT-PCR is superior in the detection of noroviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses in stool than EM. RT-PCR did not perform significantly better than EM in the diagnosis of rotavirus, but this may have been due to the fact that the RT-PCR assay in use detected only group A rotaviruses, while EM was able to detect groups A-C. Additionally, the assays used in this study were designed for laboratory research and have not been fully vetted for clinical samples.",

Providers at the institution in this study are discouraged from routinely sending stool samples in patients with acute gastroenteritis unless it will impact clinical care, and this may have caused selection bias toward children with severe symptoms. Diluted stool samples were used, which might have reduced the ability to detect viral nucleic acid present in small amounts. Additionally, the presence of viral nucleic acid in stool may not reflect the cause of current symptoms but could instead reflect prolonged shedding from a previous infection or asymptomatic carriage [Kapusinszky et al., 2012] .",

The data in this study also support the use of improved rapid, well-standardized RT-PCR diagnostic methods to establish the etiology of diarrhea.
