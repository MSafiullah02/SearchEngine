It is critical for health science to be published in English-language journals to facilitate communication and enable global coordination and timely epidemic response. However, some media were concerned that Chinese researchers within academic organisations concentrated on publishing papers in prestigious international journals but paid inadequate attention to epidemic prevention of COVID-19 and neglected to disseminate their findings within Chinese-language journals.3, 4 A recent statement by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China also encouraged researchers to focus their efforts on epidemic prevention and to publish their results in Chinese.5\n",
