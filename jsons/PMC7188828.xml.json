Mtb is able to persist in the host for decades without causing clinical symptoms, and has evolved adaptation mechanisms to survive in the harsh environment of the host, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation or low pH (Betts et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2002; Schnappinger et al., 2003). This adaptation is possible by regulation of gene expression, which in turn can be controlled by DNA methylation (Shell et al., 2013).",

In prokaryotes, it represents a primitive defense mechanism against phages and viruses, known as the Restriction-Modification (RM) system. Although adenine is the most important methylation target, e.g., N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A), there are other two types of methylation. These are found in cytosine and depend on the modification site: m4C (N4-methyl-cytosine) and m5C (C5-methyl-cytosine) (Murphy et al., 2013). In general, m6A has been used as the main signal for epigenetic regulation in bacteria, m5C has been mainly described in mammals and plant studies (Kim et al., 2009), whereas m4C is mainly present in bacteria (Kumar et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Vitamins are organic compounds that cannot be produced by the host organism. Even when they are produced, concentrations are low and external supplementation from the diet or from commensal bacteria is required. Vitamins have been found to regulate immunity, and a number of studies have reported the effect of vitamins as adjunct to treat tuberculosis (Parida et al., 2015; He et al., 2018). For example, vitamins A, C and D have been used as adjunct to complement anti-tuberculosis drugs (Dini and Bianchi, 2012; Vilcheze et al., 2013; Syal et al., 2015). The active form of thiamin (Vitamin B1, VB1), thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) (Begley et al., 1999; Settembre et al., 2003; Pohl et al., 2004), is an essential cofactor in all organisms, taking an important role in energy metabolism and degradation of sugars. In addition, VB1 plays an important role in the activation of the immune system, nerve tissue repair, neuronal communication and cell-membrane dynamics (Gibson and Blass, 2007; Manzetti et al., 2014). Recent studies have shown the effects of VB1 both in vitro and in vivo; VB1 inhibits in vitro growth of BCG with an MIC of 8 mM, whereas it limits Mtb in vivo growth by regulating innate immunity in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3-dependent manner (Hu et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019). VC also can hamper the growth of Mtb by a mechanism that involves the reduction of ferric to ferrous ion and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) through Harber-Weiss cycle and Fenton reactions (Vilcheze et al., 2013). BCG is also sensitive to Vc, with an MIC is 0.8 mM (Pei et al., 2019).",

By studying the complete set of metabolites within a microorganism and monitoring the global outcome of interactions between its development processes and the environment, metabolomics can potentially provide a more accurate snap shot of the actual physiological state of the cell. Furthermore, when these data are interpreted in combination with genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics data and so on, using what is termed a systems biology approach, a more holistic understanding of these systems can be achieved. Up to now, the metabolomics has contributed to characterize Mtb in terms of metabolism, growth and replication, pathogenicity, and drug resistance, from the perspective of systems biology (Swanepoel and Loots, 2014). For example, Meissner-Roloff compared the metabolomes of a hypo- and hyper-virulent Beijing Mtb strain and subsequently identified a reduction in various metabolite markers in the relatively hyper-virulent strain (Meissner-Roloff et al., 2012). Loots used metabolomics approach to identify potentially new metabolic pathways and metabolite markers to explain many of the phenotypical characteristics associated with a katG mutation and the resulting isoniazid-resistance in Mtb (Loots du, 2014). Additionally, metabolomics was to identify individual metabolites or metabolite profiles that could be used as biomarkers of early MAP (Mycobacterium avium subsp. Paratuberculosis) infection in ruminants (De Buck et al., 2014).",

Only m6A modifications located within 200 bp upstream of the start codon were assumed to affect genes. In this way, only 143 out of the 410 m6A sites in IGRs probably affected the promoters of 138 genes (Supplementary Table 12). In BCG treated with VC, 423 m4C were located in IGRs, where 142 affected promoters of 140 genes (Supplementary Table 12).

There were 19 unique m6A sites in VB1-treated BCG, but only one of them was located within the coding region of significantly down-regulated genes, away from the promoter region. For the 20 unique m6A sites in VC-treated BCG, two were located in the promoter region of significantly up-regulated genes (Supplementary Table 11). In that sample, m4C was found in the coding region of 31 down-regulated genes (47.7%) and 138 up-regulated genes (64.8%) (Supplementary Table 11), but it was observed in the promoter region only in 11 up-regulated genes (Supplementary Table 12). These results suggest that gene expression is not affected when methylation is in the coding region, but when m4C is located in the promoter region it contributes to up-regulate BCG gene expression. To validate this hypothesis, we compared the gene expression levels of methylated and non-methylated genes, based on their FPKM. Although no significant changes were observed for m6A-modified genes (Supplementary Figure 2), the expression levels of 65 genes harboring m4C sites in the promoter region was significantly higher than in the control that had no m4C sites (mean FPKM = 272.3 and 222.9, respectively and p < 0.05) (see Supplementary Figure 3).",

Another significantly down-regulated gene was chorismate mutase [5.4.99.5] (Supplementary Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 10), which catalyzes the transformation from chorismate to prephenate, the precursor of phenylalanine and tyrosine. This is consistent with the observed 80% reduction in Phe and Tyr after VB1 addition.

For example, Rv2416c (JTY_RS12525) is a secretory protein that enhances survival inside macrophages (Ganaie et al., 2011). Rv3130c (JTY_RS16210) encodes a triacylglycerol synthase that synthesizes triacylglycerol. This is proposed as an energy source during dormancy, and its disruption prevents triacylglycerol accumulation under inducing conditions (Sirakova et al., 2006). Rv2626c (JTY_RS13655) plays a significant role in macrophage pro-inflammatory response and in mycobacterial survival during infection (Sun et al., 2017). Rv0256c (JTY_RS01360), which can be used as a potential marker for the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis patients, may inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production in activated macrophages (Bhat et al., 2013; Abraham et al., 2014). Rv1187 (JTY_RS06330), encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, was shown to be involved in the proline-utilization pathway in Mtb, and this pathway could be a valuable therapeutic target against TB (Jena et al., 2015). Additionally, Rv2308 (JTY_RS11970), Rv2100 (JTY_RS10875) and Rv2015c (JTY_RS10425) encoding hypothetical proteins, Rv2618 (JTY_RS13615) encoding transcription regulator, Rv2893 (JTY_RS14970) encoding oxidoreductase, Rv3892c (JTY_RS20265) encoding PPE protein are also methylated at the promoter region.",

Tryptophan is classified as an essential amino acid in humans and must be acquired through the diet. This requirement alleviates the concern of common targets within humans. Recent studies found that tryptophan synthase which catalyzes the final step in tryptophan biosynthesis is one potentially novel anti-tubercular drug target (Abrahams et al., 2017). In addition, treatment with 6-FABA 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzoic acid (6-FABA) chemically induces Mtb tryptophan auxotrophy. Together with immune- mediated trypothan starvation, this results in mycobacterial death. The results provide genetic and chemical validation of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway as a target for highly active antibiotics (Zhang et al., 2013).",

Moreover, inosine exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokine from activated T cells and promoting the formation of IL-10. Clinical trials have proposed that the use of inosine to raise serum urate levels may have benefits for at least some multiple sclerosis patients.

Through RNA-seq analysis, we found that the gene encoding cysteine synthase A was significantly up-regulated after vitamin treatment, suggesting that Cys synthesis is promoted. It has been reported that isoniazid (INH)/Cys combination potentiates the killing of Mtb by stimulating respiration of Mtb from non-respiring dormancy (Vilcheze et al., 2017). High levels of intracellular cysteine can induce ROS production, causing DNA damage and oxidation of cysteine to cystine in E. coli (Park and Imlay, 2003). Indeed, transition metals, such as copper or iron, catalyze the oxidation of cysteine into cystine, leading to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals (Kachur et al., 1999). This high concentration of cysteine could therefore initiate cationic stress, resulting in the formation of ROS and DNA damage (Imlay et al., 1988; Demple and Harrison, 1994).",
