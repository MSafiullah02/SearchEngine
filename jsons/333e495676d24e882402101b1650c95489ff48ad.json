The phenomenon of hemadsorption was also first described in conncction with influenza viruses (Shelokov e t al., 1958) and reflects the same interaction between erythrocytes and viral envelope components. A number of viruses unrelated to myxoviruses have since been shown to agglutinate erythrocytes of various species. The mechanism in each case appears to differ basically from that of the myxoviruses, and in no instance is there precise knowledge as to the groupings involved in either erythrocyte surface or virion. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, proof that hemagglutination is due to the viral agent in hand depends on wlh,her the visible reaction can be inhibited by antibody directed against the whole viral particle or its active surface structures.

It is of more than historical interest that the influcnea virus-erythrocyte-glyccprotein inhibitor model has served as an important link in relating biological function to red cell membrane structurc. Influenza virus receptors are intimately associated with receptors for isoantibodies, namely blood group antigens (A, B, H, MI N ) . These scrvc as additional markers with which to recognize biological activities of purified rnembrrmc fractions. I n broad analogy with virus receptor analogs, the structure of antigenic determinants of blood group spccificity has been elucidated not from primary analysis of erythrocytes but from extcnsive study of soluble blood group substances derived froin sourccs other than red cells.

Much depends initially on the nature of thc starting material which is to be rendered soluble by onc means or another. Plasma proteins, leukocytes, and platelets are possible sources of contamination if not separated from the crythrocytes before lysis. The method of lysis used to obtain stroma, or posthemolytic residue, also has an ixriportant bearing on the purity of the end product, since hemoglobin and other cytoplasmic constituents are readily occluded and cling tenaciously to membranes of red cells lysed in distilled water.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE RED CELL MEMBRANE"}, {"text": "By hypotonic lysis under carefully controllcd conditions of pH and ionic strength, pure erythrocyte ghosts are obtainable (Dodge et al., 1963) . Such membranes retain virtually all of the lipid of the intact cell. This fact, along with their antigenic distinction from cytoplasmic constituents, makes such preparations acceptable as intact cell membranes. They appear as biconcave disks when viewed by phase-contrast microscopy and are virtually free of hemoglobin as determined by colorimetric and immunological analysis, and by electron microscopy Howe et al., 1970b) . Table I presents a simplified summary of several methods which have been used to partition membranes or posthemolytic residue into biologically active subfractions. The term \"posthemolytic residue\" is here in- tcrirlcd to signify relatively crude preparations of stroma as contrasted to membranes that retain both morphological and chemical identity and tire uncontaminated with hemoglobin, plasma protcin, or formed elements. Hot 50% phenol extraction of membranes separates into the aqueous phase a glycoprotcin (Kathan et al., 1961) which can be fuither purified through fractional etlislnol precipitation and various comhina-Lions of gel filtration and chromatography (Springer et al., 196G) . The find product is free of lipid, contains virtually a11 the sialic acid and npproxirnntcly linlf of the hexoscs and amino sugars of the membrane, ttnd is completely soluble in water. By sevcrnl diffcrcnt criteria, including polyacrylumidc gel clectrophoresis (PAGE) , ultracentrifugal analysis, ti~id immunoelectrophoresis, it represents a single component. Electron microscopic examination of a preparation of erythrocyte glycoprotein considered pure by these criteria was negatively stained witjh phosphoturigstic acid and examined by electron microscopy (Fig. l a ) . It is seen that the preparation comprises a homogeneous array of particles, although no conclusions as to ,size or configuration can be drawn due to hypcrtonicity of the staining solution. An exactly compartiblc preparation from muriric erythrocytes is shown, in which the particles are seen to be closely similar to the human siibstance in both size and uniformity (Fig. 11) ). TIic yield of glycoprotein from hurnsn crythrooytes was rcportetl to be enli:mccd if membranes wcrc extracted first with liLliiiirn diiodosrilicylate (Ids) and then with 25% aqueous phenol (Marchesi and Andrews, 1971) . Glycoprotein purified in this manner shows mtigcnic identity with the VRS and MN substances prcviously described. Recent electrophoretic studies of various glycoprotcins, includ-ing the LIS-phenol-derived erythrocyte material, have shown that apparent molecular weights vary with the degree of acrylamide cross linking (Segrest et al., 1971) . In the light of these findings, some of the molecular weights previously determined for phenol-derived glycoproteins (VRS and MN substances) by PAGE will have to be reevaluated (cf. Table  I ) . The stromal glycoprotein is a poten6 inhibitor of ,influenza virus hemagglutination, and contains, in its polysaccharide moiety, the determinants for M and N blood group antigens (Kathan et al., 1961; Howe et al., 1963; Springer et al., 1966) . It thus may be considered to encompass the sites on the erythrocyte surface to which myxoviral hemagglutinins attach, i.e., the virus receptor substance (VRS) . These surface glycoprotein sites are associated with, and appear to be extensions of intramembranous particles revealed by freeze-etching techniques and electron microscopy . Antibodies evoked in rabbits by injection of VRS in complete Freund's adjuvant may be directed not only to the particular blood group antigens contained in its polysaccharide moiety (Springer et al., 1966) , but also to the protein portion of the VRS molecule. The latter antibodies are broadly cross-reactive from one individual VRS preparation to another, independently of blood group antigens. Antibody to VRS, labeled with ferritin, reacts specifically with intact erythrocytes as well as with the external surface of hemoglobinfree membranes. Figures 2 and 3 show electron micrographs of these reactions, both of which can be blocked by prior absorption of the labeled antiserum with pure VRS (Howe et al., 1970b) . Trypsin treatment inactivates receptors for myxoviruses both on erythrocytes and in purified VRS. As a result, the electrophoretic motility of both erythrocytes aqd glycoprotein is reduced. These effects are accounted for by the cleavage of a sialopeptide from the erythrocyte glycoprotein (Cook et al., 1961) . A structural model has been proposed for this component and for its insertion into the erythrocyte (Winzler, 1969a) . The trypsin-sensitive fragment is considered to be a t the amino end of a linear polypeptide which is anchored among the cell lipids at its carboxyl end. Along the polypeptide chain are a series of oligosaccharide residues in which N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) is terminally bound. This terminally bound NANA accounts for the predominantly anionic nature of the cell surface and the rapid electrophoretic mobility of the intact pure glycoprotein itself (Cook et al., 1961; Howe and Lee, 1969; Danon e t al., 1965) . The oligosaccharide side chains are attached to the peptide through O-glycosidic linkage of 1%'-acetylgalactosamine to serine and threonine, and through N-glycosidic linkage of N-acetylglucosamine t o aspartic acid residues. The pure glycoprotein has a characteristically high content of all three of these amino acids (Winzler, 1969a; Kathan (1)) Dctnil from (a), x 100,000.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 142, "text": "(Dodge et al., 1963)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 550, "end": 569, "text": "Howe et al., 1970b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1107, "text": "(Kathan et al., 1961)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1261, "text": "(Springer et al.,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1267, "text": "196G)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2411, "end": 2439, "text": "(Marchesi and Andrews, 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2761, "end": 2783, "text": "(Segrest et al., 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 3160, "end": 3181, "text": "(Kathan et al., 1961;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3182, "end": 3200, "text": "Howe et al., 1963;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3223, "text": "Springer et al., 1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 3379, "end": 3384, "text": "(VRS)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3744, "end": 3767, "text": "(Springer et al., 1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 4260, "end": 4280, "text": "(Howe et al., 1970b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4573, "end": 4592, "text": "(Cook et al., 1961)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4694, "end": 4710, "text": "(Winzler, 1969a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5168, "end": 5187, "text": "(Cook et al., 1961;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5188, "end": 5207, "text": "Howe and Lee, 1969;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5208, "end": 5228, "text": "Danon e t al., 1965)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 572, "end": 579, "text": "Table I", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1840, "text": "(Fig. l a )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2218, "text": "(Fig. 11)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2968, "end": 2976, "text": "Table  I", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4110, "end": 4125, "text": "Figures 2 and 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Hemoglobin-free membranes"}, {"text": "Specific reaction of human erythrocyte membranes with ferritindabeled antibody to VRS.

Hemagglutination serves as a useful direct means of titering intact viral particles or hemagglutinating subunits. Since hemagglutination is a simple twocomponent system, the titer of a given preparation will depend on the concentration of viral particles and their state of aggregation.

Readings of optical density taken a t given intervals of time, and related to a normal cell suspension without virus, bear a direct relationship to the conccntratiori of viral particles. 1,evine et al.

More recently, a photornctric method has been described (Drescher et al., 1962) which depends on dctcrmining the highest dilution of virus causing maximal agglutination by extrapolation from data obtained with constant numbers of cells and varying dilutions of virus. At this point, variability in reactivity of virus with different samples of erythrocytes is minimal.

The reaction takes place at 4OC almost immediately. After 15-20 minutes the monolayers are drained and washed with cold balanced salt solution t o remove unattached cells. The preparations are then examined immediately under the microscope, before any elution of erythrocytes occurs. Done in this manner, hemadsorption may substitute for cytopathic effect in estimating titers or units of infectivity. Hemadsorption plaques represent a variation of this technique. Monolayers are infected in the same manner as for plaque titrations with a cytolytic virus. Instead of the usual solid overlay, a semisolid overlay (e.g., methyl cellulose or 0.27. agar) is used which can be removed at the end of the total incubation period without disturbing attached cells. Residual traces of medium are removed by washing with prewarmed balanced salt solution, and hemadsorption is carried out.

Electron microscopic examination of the eluted, biologically active subunits, in the presence of SDS, revealed hemagglutinin to comprise rods 40 x 140 A; the neuraminidase appeared us oblong structures 85 X 60 A with a centrally attached fiber 100 A in length. Removal of SDS by ucctone precipitation resulted in the formation of polymers of either subunit and, in mixtures of the two, in thc formation of copolymers. The results suggested that the spikes on the intact virion are of two kinds corresponding, respectivcly, to the two independently active subunits describcd. Rott et aE. (1970) subjected SDS-treated influenza virus to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. They isolated hemagglutinin which was reactive with chicken erythrocytes and which appeared on negative staining as a rodlike structure 50 A in diameter and 200 A in length; a second morphological form, composed of sphcrical particles about 40 A in diameter, was rcactive with guinea pig cells. Biologically active neuraminidase and hemagglutinin have been isolated from one and the same preparation of virus by treatment with Tween-20 and separation on Sephadex G-200. Residual hemagglutinin could be removed from neuraminidase by absorption with chicken erythrocytes. The sedimentation coefficient for hemagglutinin subunits was 8.1 S ; and that for neuraminidase, 10.8 S. Structures seen by electron microscopy in negatively stained preparations of neuraminidase consisted of aggregates in rosette formation with a central knob (Webster, 1970) . I n other studies, purified influenza A, virus was treated with ether, and the envelope components separated from nucleocapsid by electrophoretic techniques and by analytical ultracentrifugation. The isolated neuraminidase-hemagglutinin complexes tended to aggregate into rosettelike clusters and appeared to comprise either tubelike structures, rings attached to stalks, or variations between these two forms. I n this biologically active form, the neuraminidase-hemagglutinin complex waE comparable in size to the tubular structures forming the characteristic spikes of the influenza virus envelope (Hjerten et al., 1970) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1961, "end": 1976, "text": "(Webster, 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2602, "text": "(Hjerten et al., 1970)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A .

The attachment is pH dependent, and therefore may be mediated by ionizable amino acid groupings of the hemagglutinin. The work of Hoyle and Hana (1966) pointed to disulfide linkages as \"active centers\" for two major biological activities of the influenza virus particle, namely hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Chemical cleavage of S-S bonds resulted in the inactivation of one or the other of these activities, depending on the strain of virus used. Similar observations were made by Eckert (1967) on the hemagglutinin of the reassociated envelope protein of influenza virus (PR8). Hemagglutination, and its inhibition by mucoids, is generally independent of neuraminidase activity. That this dichotomy may not be absolute is suggested from recent studies (Hoyle, 1969 ) which indicate a close resemblance between the active sites of both neuraminidase and hemagglutinin in several strains of influenza virus. Through the use of reagents reacting directly with amino acids in proteins of A and A, strains, centers containing histidine were found which appeared to possess both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activity. It was concluded that histidine was essential for neuraminidase activity and that tyrosine could substitute for histidine in the hemagglutinin-active centers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 345, "text": "Hoyle and Hana (1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 951, "end": 963, "text": "(Hoyle, 1969", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A .

Adsorption appccirs to be relatively independent of temperature, and takes place with most strains equally well at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. This is largely an electrostatic interaction, and in general there are upper (pH 9.0) and lower (pH 5.0) limits to the pH range in which the reaction is maximal (Tischer, 1963) . With respect to thc molecular basis for viral attachment (hemagglutinin), much has been learned from the study of receptor analogs, the prototype of which was originally described as a nonspecific inhibitor of viral hemagglutination distinct from antibody in human serum (Francis, 1947) . Rcccptor analogs have sincc bccn obtaincd from rnnny sources. They are all glycoprotein and bind preferentially to reactive sites on the virus so as to prevent attachment to crythrocytcs. Irihihitory action in all cases is ubolished following treatment with reagents (e.g., pcriodutc oxidation, trypsin, neuraininidase or receptor-destroying enzyme of Vibrio cholerue or Clostridiupra perfringens) which modify tlic polysaccharide moiety by alteration of NANA residucs, or their removal from the macromolecule. A pttrtial list of inhibitory glycoproteins includes, besides human and animal sera : egg components, urinary mucoprotein, ovarian cyst fluid, mcconiurn, Collocalia mucoid (Howc ef al., 1961 j , nncl extracts of tissues, e.g., lung and erythrocytes, of several species. Extensive study of purified glycoproteins has shown that the residuc csscnlial for intcraction with influenza virus is N-acetylneuraminic acid (Gottschalk, 1966a,b) . Recent studies have shown further that carbons 7, 8, and 9 in the polyhydroxyl side chain of NANA are involved in the binding of sialoproteins t o irifluerietL virus (Suttajit and Winder, 1971 ) . Althollgh all inhibitors of influenza virus hemagglutination contain NANA, not all sialoproteins are active inhibitors. The inhibitory potency of a glycoprotein is determined by the number of negatively chargcd terminal sialic acid residues which can attach simultaneously to complcmcntary groupings of the viral surface. The attachment in turn is a function of the number of sialic acid residues available per molecule of glycoprotein and the degree of complementarity of the viral surface (Fazekas de St. Groth and Gottschalk, 1963) . The basis for the latter is still unknown. A relationship between molecular size, sialic acid content, and inhibitory activity has been recognized among a number of naturally occurring inhibitors of influenza virus hemagglutination (Springer et al., 1969) . Such a relationship was also demonstrated artificially with serum orosomucoid, which in the native state is a weak inhibitor. Polymers, produced by heating under controlled conditions, had molecular weights greater than 200,000 and on a weight basis were found to be much more potent inhibitors than the monomeric form (Whitehead and Winzler, 1968). Inhibitory activity was lost after treatment with V . cholerae neuraminidase. Concordant results were obtained with orosomucoid polymerized by crosslinking with acetaldehyde (Morawiecki and Lisowska, 1965). A polymer of molecular weight in excess of 800,000 showed activity approximately 600-fold greater than that of the monomer. A filamentous form of heatpolymerized orosomucoid was found to be more active against certain strains of influenza virus than a globular form of the same macromolecule (Barclay et al., 1969) . This observation suggested that multiple reactive sites on the viral particle might be more reactive with sialic residues in a linear disposition than on a convoluted molecule? thus accounting for the greater inhibitory efficiency of the \"chain\" polymer over that of the \"ball.\" However, hemagglutination by viral subunits was equally sensitive to inhibition by the two morphological forms of orosomucoid. Therefore, it seems that factors other than simply the spatial configuration of NANA residues must be essential for interaction with viral hemagglutinin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 405, "text": "(Tischer, 1963)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 679, "end": 694, "text": "(Francis, 1947)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1642, "text": "(Gottschalk, 1966a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1839, "text": "(Suttajit and Winder, 1971 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2333, "end": 2376, "text": "(Fazekas de St. Groth and Gottschalk, 1963)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2634, "text": "(Springer et al., 1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 3486, "end": 3508, "text": "(Barclay et al., 1969)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A .

This factor ( p inhibitor) is not inactivated by periodate or neuraminidase, either of bacterial or viral origin; it requires calcium ions for activity and is inactivated by trypsin. These properties suggest that the antiviral activity involves peptide rather than glycosidic linkages, and by analogy, that erythrocyte receptors for influenza virus may exist which do not involve terminal NANA residues. The p inhibitor seems to have greater activity against A, than against B strains of influenza virus (Hoyle, 1968) . A third type of nonspecific inhibitor (gamma inhibitor) is present in some normal animal sera, particularly those of horses and guinea pigs. The horse serum inhibitor is a glycoprotein distinct from antibody and is highly active against A, strains of influenza virus, with little activity against A, or B strains. It is stable to heat and neutralizes hemagglutinin as well as infectivity in 0210. This neutralizing effect was ascribed to the unusual avidity of some strains of virus to complex with receptor groupings on the glycoprotein. The firmness of the inhibitor-virus union may also have been due to incomplete receptor dcstruction by viral enzyme and consequent failure of virus and inhibitors to dissociate. Fractionation and structural studics (Levinson et al., 1969) of horse serum inhibitor showed that it comprised two active siibstituents in the polysaccharide moiety, namely 4-O-acctyl-NANA as well as NANA. The former rcprcsented the grouping active against A, influenza virus, the latter the residue reactive with a recent B isolate. In accord with this interpretation was thc fact that the A? inhibitor was sensitive to viral ncuraminidase only after trealrncnt with mild alkali. I n addition, metaperiodate treatment enhanced the inhibitory activity against the B virus. Since this type of enhancement had not been encountered in strains of influenza virus isolated prior to 1965, it was postulated that this biologicti1 change was related to natural antigenic modifications emerging a t the same time.

Elution of influenza virus was initially recognized as being enzymatic in nature (Hirst, 1942) and is now known to be due to the action of neuraminidase in the viral envelope. While the completeness with which influenza viral particles elute from the crythrocyte surface may vary from strain to strain, the basic mechanism can be considered the same in all cases. Elution of the viral particle is accompanied by release of NANA from the receptor site. Similarly, in the interaction with soluble analogs, viral neuraminidase effects a degrec of dissociation which varies with the strain, as intimated above. Structural studies with orosomucoid have indicated that the prosthetic groupings necessary for interaction with influenza virus include oligosaccharide side chains, linked O-glycosidically to serine and threonine (Gottschalk, 1965) . NANA occupies a terminal nonreducing position in a-ketosidic linkage to N-acetylgalactosamine; it is at this latter bond that viral neuraminidase acts to free NANA from glycoprotein inhibitors (Graham and Gottschalk, 1960; Carubelli et al., 1965; Gottschalk, 1966a) .

By freeze-etching techniques, it was demonstrated that smooth, plaquelike areas had formed, through obliteration or redistribution of normally well-ordered and numerous intramembranous particles (Bachi and Howe, unpublished) .

I n sum, it appears that with Sendai virus, as probably also with the other paramyxoviruses, red cell lysis is a complex interaction between intact virion, or its larger subunits, and the cell surface. Those factors which are known to be operative are the requirement for firm adsorption of hemagglutinin to sialoprotein cell receptors, readily effected at 4OC, and a sufficient area of contact between intact virion or larger envelope fragments and the cell receptor sites. Temperature and p H dependence suggest that some form of enzymatic activity is involved in effecting the initial breach in the integrity of the cell membrane. This results either in lysis of individual cells or, if virus-coated cells remain in close apposition to one another, in fusion and relatively restricted loss of hemoglobin.

LLSoIuble,\" noninfective hemagglutinating particles in cultures of measles virus are now recognizcd as being subunits, or fragments of envelope which accumulate in cultures as cytopathology progresses. These have been referred to as \"large hemagglutinin,\" infective and noninfective hemagglutinin, and small hemagglutinin, respectively (E. C. J. Norrby et al., 1964) . The large hemagglutinin has been characterized as either intact infective virus or virions which have undergone partial disorganization and hence are no longer infective, but retain the physical properties of the particle. The small hemagglutinin, being noninfective, has no RNP core and varies in density over a relatively wide range. A certain proportion of the small hemagglutinins are seen as high density particles with a characteristic rosette appearance. Treatment of virus with Tween 80 and ether (E. Norrhy, 1962; Funahashi and Kitawaki, 1963) results in the conversion of most of the hemagglutinin to this latter form, at the same time substantially increasing the hemagglutinin titer of the preparation. Ether by itself disrupts the viral envelope with consequent reduction in hemagglutinin titer. The function of the Tween is to protect the smaller protein subunits from denaturation and hence to preserve their activity. Tween 80-ether-treated hemagglutinin is more sensitive to inhibition by antibody and thercfore constitutes an improvement over crude culture fluids as a reagent for use in hemagglutinationinhibition tests. Treatment of virus with sodium deoxycholate (SDS) results in the disintegration of viral particles and allows better separation of nucleocapsid from the small rosette hemagglutinin than is achieved with Tween 80-ether treatment. For this reason, SDS would appear to be a satisfactory reagent for the separation of nonhemagglutinating, complement-fixing antigens (nucleocapsid) from envelope constituents (Norrby, 1966) . A small hemagglutinin has also been described which was found to have a lower buoyant density than the others. This low density particle, lacking RNA, was capable of hemolysis and of causing an early CPE. The latter was in all probability the same phenomenon as the early, rapid fusion produced by the application of high titers of measles virus to cell monolayers (Cascardo and Karzon, 1965) . The character of the cytopathology and of the viral progeny resulting from the infection of monolayers with measles virus has been found to vary with the multiplicity of infection. Virus passaged as undiluted culture fluid caused the formation of incomplete virus consisting of antigen with high hemagglutinating and hemolytic titers and relatively low infectivity; whereas virus passaged a t high dilution resulted in production of virus with almost no hemagglutinin or hemolytic activity, but with high infectivity.

While infectivity is not a prerequisite for hemolysis, it is clear now that the size of the hemagglutinating particle is critical. Thus, intact virion, large noninfective hemagglutinin, and the small hemagglutinin of low density are all hemolytic; all three are also capable of rapid cell fusion (Waterson, 1965) .

The results were similar to those reported with Sendai virus hemagglutinin and hemolysin (Neurath, 1 9 6 4~)~ pointing to the aromatic amino acids as having a critical role in the mediation of these activities by peptides of the viral envelope.

Reference to the summary tahlc (Table 111) will show that division into tlicsc groups is based on \"complete\" or \"partial\" agglutination of rhcsus, rat, or human erythrocytes. Each group can be subdivided further according to the reactivity with erythrocytes of additional species (mouse, guinea pig, and grivet) (Wadell, 1970) . Various morphological subunits associated with hemagglutinating and otlicr properties of thc3 viral capsid have been identified arid form the basis for the nomenclaturc which is now widely accepted (Ginsbcrg ct al., 19661.

I n group 3, the \"partial\" pattern produced by the direct action of the virus preparation is seen RS a button in the midst of agglutinated cells. This pattern can be rendered \"complete,\" that is uniform, by the addition of hcterotypic antibody (Ruben, 1960a; Pereira and Figueircdo, 1962) . Other strains, showing little or no hcmagglutination, could be made to agglutinate by the same proccdurc. Both \"complete\" and \"partial\" forins of agglutination are inhibited by type-specific antibody. The principal mediator of hcmagglutination is thc fiber antigen on tlie intact virion as well as on the various subunits recoverable as \"soluble\" hemagglutinins in fractions of infected cells. From tlie functional standpoint, thcsc subunits may be either complete (bi-or multivalent) or incomplete (monovalent) hemagglutinins. The complete hcmagglutinins me the intact virion and several structural forms of soluble hemagglutinin, nanicly the dodecon (12 pentons with intact fibers) and clirncrs of either pentons or fibers. Single pentons or fibers are incomplete hernagglutinins which, although monovalent, are capable of adsorbing to thc crythrocytc surface. This was shown by the capacity of fiber antigen to inhibit agglutination of rat or human cells by purified virions (Wadell, 1969) . The incomplete hemagglutinins arc rendered bivalent through combination with heterospecific antibody. The latter is directed either to the vertex capsomere of pentons, or to an antigen in the proximal portion of the fiber (Wig. 4) . The antigenic corriplexity of the fiber antigen increases with length, from one serotype to another. It is perhaps significant that, in general, fiber antigens of group 3 viruses are the longest, and are the most amenable to interaction with heterotypic antibody in the formation of complete agglutinin (E.

The action of so-called \"reccptor modifying factor\" originally found in cell cultures of group 3 viruses (Kasel et al., 1961; Kasel and Huber, 1964) can probably now be explained as competitive inhibition of the complete rat and human 0 cell agglutinins by fiber antigens elaborated by group 2 or group 3 viruses (Wadell, 1969) .

The basic procedure involves the extraction of homogenized infected brain tissue with acetone in the presence of sucrose, the function of the latter being to protect the virus from the action of acetone. Acetone presumably separates viral particles from normal brain lipids which interfere with the attachment of hemagglutinin to erythrocytes. Aqueous extracts of brain tissue usually have lower hemagglutination titers due to the presence of these lipids. A recent study (Pedreira et al., 1969) , endeavoring to compare the utility of several preparative methods, demonstrated that simple genetron extraction of suckling mouse brain yielded antigens comparable to those derived by sucrose-acetone extraction. The hemagglutinating titer of group C viruses is enhanced by sonification and in certain instances by trypsin treatment (Ardoin et al., 1969) .

However, with those strains that do hemagglutinate, the reaction can be inhibited with type-specific antibody. The optimum pH varies from strain to strain, as does also the optimum temperature.

Hemagglutination takes place best at 4OC with avian erythrocytes, particularly those of the goose, newly hatched chickens or pigeons. Erythrocytes of mammalian species are nonreactive. Rubella virus adsorbed to erythrocytes does not elute spontaneously and at the pH of maximum agglutination is not capable of elution by RDE, myxoviruses or trypsin (Furukawa et al., 1967) . However, the addition of Versene or elevation of the pH to 8.6 at 37OC cause elution of the virus. Erythrocyte receptors remain unaltered. The nonspecific hemagglutination inhibitor present in human and animal sera is thought to be p-lipoprotein, since it is inactivated by phospholipase C, is relatively heat stable and, as already noted, can be precipitated by heparin-MnC1, (Dold and Northrop, 1968 ) as well as by antibody to p-lipoprotein (E. Norrby, 1969b) .
