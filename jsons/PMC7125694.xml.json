            "text": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76-amino acid post-translational modifier fundamental to cellular homeostasis. Cellular processes regulated by ubiquitin modification range from classically known Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation to DNA repair, cell division, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), mRNA stability and even regulation of the innate immune system [1]. Not surprisingly, deregulation of the ubiquitin system is associated with various serious illnesses such as cancer, immunological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [2]. The post-translational modifier can be covalently attached to substrate proteins at the \u025b-amino group of lysine residues or at the protein's N-terminal residue [3, 4]. Since ubiquitin harbors seven intrinsic lysine residues, it can also be conjugated to another Ub moiety. In this manner, homotypical ubiquitin chains of a single linkage type consisting of M1, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 or K63 can be formed, all of which are known to exist in vivo [5]. In addition, heterotypical chains of multiple ubiquitin linkage types can be formed, opening up an even more complex layer of post-translational modification (Figure 1a). Conjugation of Ub to a substrate protein is carried out by a cascade of three enzymatic activities: E1 ubiquitin-activating, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating and E3 ubiquitin-ligating activities (Figure 1b). To date, 2 human E1s, about 40 E2s and over 600 E3 enzymes are known. The combination of E2 and E3 enzymes dictates what type of ubiquitin chain is formed and which substrate protein becomes ubiquitinated. In addition, the ubiquitination status of a protein can be regulated by removal or editing of ubiquitin chains, which is carried out by a family of approximately 100 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [6]. For some of these DUBs, linkage specificity has also been observed. To study the properties of differentially linked ubiquitin chains, traditionally one has relied on generating chains enzymatically by usage of linkage specific E2\u2013E3 pairs. Not all E2-E3 pairs are known however, and some have only been uncovered recently. This resulted in a less extensive knowledge of the \u2018a-typical\u2019 K6-linked, K11-linked, K27-linked, K29-linked and K33-linked ubiquitin chains. Therefore, much effort has been put into making differentially linked ubiquitin derivatives through synthetic and semi-synthetic methods, since these methods allow site specific incorporation of a specific chemoselective ligation handle. In addition, ubiquitin-based DUB probes and fluorescent ubiquitin-based enzyme substrates have seen an enormous boost, producing ubiquitin-based tools in all sorts of different flavors [7]. Two other highly investigated areas of synthetic and semi-synthetic ubiquitin\u2013conjugate research focus on ubiquitinated histones [8, 9] and ubiquitinated \u03b1-synuclein [10, 11]. We will briefly introduce the current synthetic and semi-synthetic methods that can be applied to generate ubiquitin and Ub-based tools and then focus on three other rapidly developing areas. First, we discuss how semi-synthetic diubiquitin synthesis has aided the structural characterization of all differentially linked diubiquitin modules, which further enhanced our understanding of how different linkages can confer specific signals. Next, we focus on recent advances in diubiquitin-based DUB probes and the development of ubiquitin ligase probes that open up new interesting areas of ubiquitin structural biology. Finally, we discuss advances in making synthetic and semi-synthetic ubiquitin molecules containing other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation.",

            "text": "Native chemical ligation (NCL) has been an extremely useful tool to make ubiquitin, ubiquitin\u2013peptide conjugates, ubiquitin dimers and ubiquitin tetramers, as reviewed recently by Pham et al. [11]. Chemical synthesis of ubiquitinated peptides was first established by Muir and co-workers and utilizes a ligation auxiliary where the auxiliary group is removed under photolytic conditions; yielding a natively linked Ub-peptide conjugate [12]. Today, most reported methods rely on the incorporation of a \u03b3-thiolysine or \u03b4-thiolysine moiety at a designated lysine residue to allow NCL with a thioester moiety. The thiol containing ubiquitin module can be synthesized with total, linear synthesis [13], or from two fragments [14]. During the total, linear fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) approach, the growing peptide chain is stabilized by the incorporation of special building blocks that prevent the formation of aggregates as the ubiquitin chain grows. In the two segment approach, an N-terminal Ub(1\u201345)-SR fragment is synthesized and ligated to a synthetic C-terminal Ub[(46\u201376)-A46C] fragment. In the latter fragment, alanine 46 is replaced by N-methylcysteine to allow NCL with the first fragment and is afterwards converted into the native alanine residue through a desulphurization step. To make ubiquitin dimers and other conjugates, a thioester needs to be introduced at the ubiquitin C-terminus for NCL with the Ub thiolysine-containing module. The thioester functionality can be incorporated by E1-mediated enzymatic conversion with sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNa) [13] or during Fmoc-based SPPS [15]. Next, NCL can be performed and a subsequent desulphurization step results in a ubiquitin conjugate that bears the native isopeptide linkage. The above described methods are schematically represented in Figure 2a,b. In addition, other strategies yielding a non-native isopeptide linkage have been reported and include oxime-based ligation for non-hydrolysable ubiquitin\u2013conjugate synthesis [16] and thioether based ligation to prepare diubiquitin [17], branched tri-ubiquitin [18] and polyubiquitin [19] modules that retain a sulfur atom in the forged isopeptide bond. It is clear that synthetic protein chemistry has much to offer to the biological community, but one must keep in mind that the chemistry is not always straightforward. In addition, protein folding must always be checked, although this is less of an issue with the very stable ubiquitin protein.",

            "text": "Next to synthetic strategies, protein semi-synthesis has also become a very convenient strategy for the production of large peptides and small proteins since it was first introduced. Using expressed protein as the starting material, a number of strategies have been invented to equip the protein with chemical reactive groups, labels or fluorogenic dyes. For instance, the use of inteins has become a useful tool for the formation of protein thioesters through MESNa-mediated thiolysis (Figure 2c) [20]. Expansion of the genetic code with unnatural amino acids (UAAs) has further aided the field of protein semi-synthesis [21]. Briefly, an UAA can be incorporated by a modified transfer RNA (tRNA) at the site of a rarely used codon, such as the amber stop codon in E. coli. To this end, the active site of the complementary aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) needs to be mutated to allow selective recognition of the UAA, which will then be transferred to the modified tRNA and eventually incorporated into the newly translated protein. While genetic code expansion-based methods are clearly useful, most do require certain expertise that can only be found in specialized labs and often require specific E. coli strains and tRNA pairs. Below, we will discuss genetic code expansion strategies employed on ubiquitin, while a more extensive overview of incorporation of chemoselective unnatural amino acids in general is discussed by Lang et al. [22].",

The advantage of this method is that it does not require extensive knowledge of peptide chemistry nor of genetic code expansion. In this case, allylamine was used to equip the Ub C-terminus with an alkene. Expressed ubiquitin lysine to cysteine mutants at the desired lysine conjugation site were converted into ubiquitin dimers by UV irradiation [25\u2022]. Through this procedure, a C-terminal alkyne moiety was also introduced, which in turn can be used as a reactive group to form non-hydrolysable ubiquitin conjugates with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, or \u2018click chemistry\u2019).",

For click chemistry, both an azide and an alkyne are needed. The methionine analog azidohomoalanine (Aha) was incorporated on the ubiquitin C-terminus as the azide containing unnatural amino acid. The alkyne functionality was introduced at one of the desired lysine conjugation positions by using propargyl-derivatized pyrrolysine (Plk) and the PylRS/tRNAPyl pair of Methanosarcina barkeri [27]. After introduction of both azide and alkyne functionalities, non-hydrolysable ubiquitin conjugates can be formed by CuAAC. Such non-hydrolysable ubiquitin-based tools can be utilized to address the selective nature of ubiquitin binding domains towards a certain diubiquitin molecule [28], to study the impact of a monoubiquitination event such as on Pol\u03b2 [27] and PCNA [29], or to study the effect of non-hydrolysable polyubiquitin chains such as K11 on cell cycle related events [30].",

In these efforts, people have been hampered by the lack of specific E2 and E3 enzymes to generate the so-called atypical (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33) chains. The K6 diubiquitin structure was first solved by using the semi-synthetic GOPAL approach [23]. Only recently an enzymatic approach for making K6-polyubiquitin chains was reported [31]. K11 diubiquitin structure elucidation was achieved by two groups independently in 2010 [32, 33] after a K11-specific ligase was identified in 2009 [34]. Recently, K29-linked and K33-linked diubiquitins have been structurally characterized after a combinatorial ligation\u2013deubiquitination approach was developed to generate such linkages enzymatically [35, 36]. Currently, only K27-linked ubiquitin cannot be prepared fully enzymatically, although interestingly a recent study reports K27 polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase RNF168 [37]. Nevertheless, semi-synthetic and synthetic strategies have been an indispensable tool for studying the structural and biophysical properties of atypical diubiquitins.",

With the exception of K11-linked diubiquitin, all were prepared by a variant of the semi-synthetic GOPAL method. Based on SANS (small-angle neutron scattering), 15N relaxation and RDC (residual dipolar coupling) NMR data, Casta\u00f1eda et al. found that the available diubiquitin crystal structure data poorly overlaps with their in-solution NMR data, which suggests a great flexibility in conformation of Ub chains [38\u2022\u2022]. Multiple crystal conformations for the same diubiquitin molecules have indeed been reported, which is consistent with this notion. The same approach was next used to further characterize the atypical K27 diubiquitin linkage in particular [39\u2022]. Interestingly, K27 diubiquitin was processed very inefficiently by the DUBs tested, including more promiscuous ones. It must be noted however that in other studies, DUBs have been described that do cleave K27-linked diubiquitin quite similarly to other diubiquitin molecules, albeit not specifically [40, 41]. The study by Casta\u00f1eda et al. provides the first structural analysis of K27 diubiquitin: it shows that the K27 residue is almost completely buried in the diubiquitin structure and that it has very low solvent accessibility. In addition, the C-terminal Gly75\u201376 region of the distal Ub moiety is more ordered compared to the other known diubiquitin structures. This structural aspect might explain why K27 diubiquitin is processed less efficiently by some DUBs.",

Best studied is the crosstalk between ubiquitin and SUMO [73], but ubiquitinated-NEDD8 chains have also been reported [74], as well as the existence of ubiquitinated FAT10 [75], ISGylated ubiquitin [76] and ubiquitinated Atg12 [77]. The protein (semi)-synthesis community is moving rapidly to catch up with this phenomenon and semi-synthetic strategies for obtaining ubiquitinated SUMO-2 [24] and ubiquitinated Rub1, the yeast NEDD8 homolog, have already been reported [78\u2022]. Synthetic strategies for obtaining full length UbL proteins such as Nedd8 [61], SUMO-1 [79, 80\u2022] and Ufm1 [81] are also starting to emerge. It is not hard to imagine the existence of other PTMs on ubiquitin such as methylation or glycosylation, both of which could be incorporated through (semi-)synthetic approaches. Plenty of opportunities are available in this area and we expect that future research will provide many more interesting insights into this exciting new field.",

The synthesis of lysine-specific, homotypical polyubiquitin chains is such an example; as is the (semi-)synthesis of heterotypical ubiquitin chains and mixed Ub/UbL chains. With regard to probes, much more can be achieved by extending the scope towards ubiquitin-like proteins, which in general is a much less characterized class of proteins. Many opportunities also still lie in the (semi-)synthesis of these UbL proteins, which would allow incorporation of fluorogenic dyes, warheads, ligation sites or other useful chemical handles. Finally, the seemingly limitless emerging post-translational crosstalk between protein modifiers reveals a whole new layer of interesting protein regulation. Here, (semi)-synthetic biology would certainly add great value to help understanding the expanded ubiquitin code. Not only for ubiquitin itself, but also for ubiquitin-like proteins and possibly even their decoding sequences: (ubiquitin) binding domains.",

Synthetic and semi-synthetic strategies to obtain ubiquitin and ubiquitin-based derivatives have provided indispensable tools to study ubiquitin biochemistry. Structural NMR-based characterization of semi-synthetic atypical diubiquitins has revealed great flexibility of the ubiquitin signal and helped further understanding of how different Ub linkages can confer specific signals. Ubiquitin-based probes have helped understanding DUB activation mechanisms and the coming of new diubiquitin-based DUB probes will shed more insight into polyubiquitin recognition. Ub-based ligase probes are starting to emerge and will provide more mechanistic investigation of the ubiquitin ligation process. Additionally, techniques are starting to emerge to study an even more intricate layer of the ubiquitin signal: post-translational modification of ubiquitin itself. Deamidation, acetylation and phosphorylation of ubiquitin have been reported and in addition, crosstalk between ubiquitin-like proteins and Ub is known to exist in vivo. We expect that the use of synthetic and semi-synthetic strategies will be very useful to study this exciting new field of ubiquitin regulation as they allow control over the exact site of the modification.",
