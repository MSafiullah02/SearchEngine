To date, little is known about the host factors or cellular signaling mechanisms associated with PDCoV replication. Since the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is involved in modulation of various important cellular functions, numerous DNA and RNA viruses coopt this pathway for efficient propagation. In the present study, we found that PDCoV induces the activation of ERK1/2 and its downstream substrate Elk-1 early in infection irrespective of viral biosynthesis. Chemical inhibition or knockdown of ERK1/2 significantly suppressed viral replication, whereas treatment with an ERK activator increased viral yields. Direct pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation had no effect on the viral entry process but sequentially affected the post-entry steps of the virus life cycle. In addition, pharmacological sequestration of cellular or viral cholesterol downregulated PDCoV-induced ERK signaling, highlighting the significance of the cholesterol contents in ERK activation. However, ERK inhibition had no effect on PDCoV-triggered apoptosis through activation of the cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, suggesting the irrelevance of ERK activation to the apoptosis pathway during PDCoV infection. Altogether, our findings indicate that the ERK signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in viral biosynthesis to facilitate the optimal replication of PDCoV.",

Since its discovery in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012) , the virus has emerged in most parts of the world with industrialized pig production, threatening the swine industry worldwide (Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Madapong et al., 2016; Marthaler et al., 2014; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2012) . PDCoV is a large, enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 25.4 kb that belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Jung et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2012) . The PDCoV genome is composed of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least six open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 5), and a 3\u2032 UTR. The first two large ORF1a and 1b comprising the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encode two overlapping replicase polyproteins via a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift. Subsequent post-translational processing of the polyproteins by viral proteases results in 15 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp2-16). The remaining ORFs in the 3\u2032-proximal region code for the four canonical coronaviral structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as three accessory proteins, nonstructural gene 6 (NS6), NS7, and NS7a (Fang et al., 2016 (Fang et al., , 2017 Lai et al., 2007; Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "As viruses are limited in their genome size and coding capacity, they rely on a myriad of cellular factors or mechanisms to ensure coordinated replication. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are central signaling networks that control a large number of principal cellular processes. The Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway is one of the MAPK cascades and comprises an array of three consecutive acting kinases: Raf, MEK1/2, and the extracellular signaling-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Upon various extracellular stimuli, this regulatory cascade event results in ERK1/2 activation, which phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates, leading to the transcription of multiple genes essential for diverse cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival or apoptosis (Diehl and Schaal, 2013; Gaur et al., 2010; Roux and Blenis, 2004; Shaul and Seger, 2007) . Hence, it is not surprising that viruses hijack cellular signaling cascades, which in turn modulate and contribute to viral survival. Indeed, a number of viruses have been shown to inherit the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to complete their replication cycle (Cai et al., 2007; Kim and Lee, 2015; Lee and Lee, 2010; Lim et al., 2005; Marjuki et al., 2006; Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008; Preugschas et al., 2019; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2014; Sch\u00fcmann and Dobbelstein, 2006; Wang et al., 2006; Wei and Liu, 2009; Zampieri et al., 2007) . However, the importance of the ERK signaling pathway in PDCoV replication has not been investigated thus far. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine whether PDCoV infection activates the ERK cascade in cultured cells and whether ERK activation is required for viral propagation.",

The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of humidified air containing 5 % CO 2 . PDCoV strain KNU16-07 was propagated in ST cells in virus growth medium [\u03b1-MEM supplemented with antibiotic-antimycotic solutions, 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), and 5 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin (USB, Cleveland, OH)] without FBS as described previously (Jang et al., 2018) . Mock-infected ST cells were also maintained under the same conditions with virus growth medium in the absence of FBS. The virus or mock inoculum stocks were prepared by freezing/thawing of virus-infected or un-infected ST cells, respectively, as described previously . Inactivation of PDCoV was performed by UV irradiation of the virus suspension with 1000 mJ/cm 2 using a UV crosslinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Virus inactivation was confirmed by the inoculation of the UV-treated virus on ST cells followed by N protein-specific staining as described below, and the inactivated virus was stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059, and ERK-specific and unconjugated control siRNAs were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All reagents, except for M\u03b2CD, were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), while M\u03b2CD was prepared in distilled water. These compounds were diluted to the desired concentrations in maintenance medium and present during the entire period of virus or mock infection. The PDCoV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) was described previously (Jang et al., 2018) . Antibodies specific for ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and phosphorylated Elk-1 (p-Elk-1), were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The cytochrome c (cyt c), Bax, and \u03b2-actin antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG and Alexa Flour 594conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (200 nM) were acquired from Invitrogen.",

For subcellular fractionation, infectious or UV-inactivated PDCoV-infected ST cells were fractionated using a Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). To investigate the effect of ERK inhibition or promotion on PDCoV replication, cells were independently pretreated with U0126 or PMA for 1 h and then infected with PDCoV at an MOI of 1.

In addition, the activation profile of ERK1/2 was comparably dynamic in cells infected with PDCoV at an MOI of 0.1 (data not shown). These results indicated that PDCoV infection triggers early strong but temporary activation of ERK1/2. Since ERK1/2 phosphorylation did not steadily increase with ongoing replication, it was assumed that ERK1/2 activation occurred independent of the considerable protein production obvious at later time points. To confirm this hypothesis, we used UV-irradiated inactivated PDCoV, which can bind to and internalize into target cells but cannot replicate upon infection. UV-inactivated PDCoV was able to sufficiently stimulate ERK1/2 activation with similar kinetics as that observed in PDCoV-infected cells (Fig. 1B) .

In addition, the levels of total ERK1/2 remained unchanged in the cells infected with both normal and inactivated PDCoV at various time points after infection when compared to those in mock-infected cells.

Considering that the transcription factor Elk-1 is downstream of ERK and its activity is regulated by ERK-dependent phosphorylation (Wei and Liu, 2009 ), we investigated the activation status of Elk-1 following PDCoV-induced ERK activation (Fig. 3) . PDCoV infection augmented the amount of phosphorylated Elk-1 with kinetics that indistinguishably coincided with those observed in ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A) . Likewise, phosphorylated Elk-1 components increased in cells treated with UV-inactivated PDCoV, comparable to the increase in PDCoV-infected cells (Fig. 3B) .

ST cells were pretreated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or PD98059 at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u03bcM or with DMSO (0.5 %) as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. The inhibitors and DMSO were present during the entire period of infection. The results of an MTT assay revealed that none of the inhibitor doses tested in the present study affected the cell viability (data not shown). Viral production was assessed by monitoring the strength of the CPE and confirmed by immunofluorescence using N protein-specific MAb at 12 hpi (Fig. 4A ). Vehicle-treated control cells exhibited distinct CPE and PDCoV N protein-specific staining in many cell clusters, indicating infection and the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. Similarly, virus propagation was clearly observed in the presence of PD98059 at all concentrations examined, indicating no detrimental effect on PDCoV replication. However, the inhibitory effect of U0126 on virus infection was readily detectable. As shown in Fig. 4A , U0126 significantly suppressed PDCoV-induced CPE (first panels) and PDCoV gene expression (second panels) in a dose-dependent manner. Quantification of N protein staining results showed that the proportion (%) of virus-infected cells was only reduced upon U0126 treatment, leading to nearly 90 % inhibition at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 4B) . To further verify relevance, we determined the activation status of ERK1/2 using a FACE assay after treatment with the two inhibitors in PDCoV-infected cells. PD98059 did not affect PDCoV-induced ERK activation, whereas U0126 markedly declined the levels of p-ERK1/2 (Fig. 4C) . The specificity and effectiveness of each inhibitor on PDCoV infection-induced phosphorylation of ERK and its downstream target Elk-1 were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4D ). Taken together, these data demonstrated that the MEK inhibitor hampered ERK and Elk-1 activation and accordingly attenuated PDCoV propagation, indicating a virtual role of ERK1/2 as cellular factors for PDCoV infection. We used U0126 in all subsequent experiments due to its significant inhibitory effect on PDCoV replication.",

The addition of 100 \u03bcM U0126 up to 1 hpi resulted in inhibitory effects on PDCoV production compared to the levels in the DMSO-added control. Treating cells with U0126 at \u22121 and 0 hpi resulted in an approximately 90 % decrease, while treatment at 1 hpi caused a 60 % reduction in viral infectivity. However, no significant inhibition in PDCoV propagation was identified when the compound was added after 1 hpi. In addition, treatment of cells with U0126 up to 1 hpi caused a significant diminution in ERK and Elk-1 activation in PDCoV-infected cells, which are corresponding to the decrease of virus production at the indicated time points of chemical application (Fig. 5B) . These results corroborated that U0126 must be present at the adsorption stage of viral infection to exert its inhibitory effect on PDCoV replication by suppressing ERK activation.

ST cells were inoculated with PDCoV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to allow only virus attachment and were further maintained either at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C to limit or permit virus internalization, respectively, in the presence of U0126.

Serially diluted infected cells were then subjected to an infectious center assay on uninfected ST cell monolayers, and virus titers were measured (Fig. 8A) . The cells maintained at 4\u00b0C to permit virus binding while preventing internalization produced infectious virus particles irrespective of the presence of U0126, likely due to incomplete removal of the bound viruses. Moreover, the viral titers were equivalent in cells treated with U0126 or vehicle incubated at 37\u00b0C to allow virus penetration to proceed.

The sg mRNA transcripts are translated late in the cycle to their respective structural proteins. Therefore, to investigate the functional mechanism of ERK1/2 regulation of PDCoV infection in the post-entry phases, we first tested whether the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation exclusively affected genome replication and sg mRNA transcription. To accomplish this, the relative levels of both genomic RNA and sg mRNA were measured using quantitative real-time strand-specific RT-PCR in the presence or absence of U0126 following PDCoV infection. As shown in Fig. 8B , U0126 greatly diminished the synthesis of PDCoV genomic RNA and sg mRNA in a dose-dependent manner compared to that in DMSO-treated infected cells. The decreases in viral RNA levels after the addition of U0126 did not reflect nonspecific inhibition of transcription because the mRNA levels of the internal \u03b2-actin control remained unchanged in all samples (data not shown).",

Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activation has no effect on virus entry but interferes with each post-entry step of PDCoV replication. (A) Effect of ERK inhibition on virus binding and internalization. ST cells were infected with PDCoV at an MOI of 1 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. After washing with cold PBS, infected cells were maintained in the presence or absence of U0126, either at 4\u00b0C (red bars) or 37\u00b0C (blue bars) for an additional hour. The virus-infected cells maintained at 37\u00b0C were further treated with proteinase K at 37\u00b0C. The infected cells were then serially diluted and plated onto fresh ST cells. At 24 h post-incubation, internalized viruses were titrated by IFA. (B) Effect of ERK inhibition on viral RNA synthesis. ST cells pretreated with DMSO or U0126 were mock infected or infected with PDCoV (MOI of 1) for 1 h and then incubated in either DMSO or U0126. Total cellular RNA was extracted at 12 hpi, and strand-specific viral genomic RNAs (red bars) and sg mRNAs (blue bars) of PDCoV were amplified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Viral positive-sense genomic RNA and sg mRNA levels were normalized to those of porcine \u03b2-actin, and relative quantities (RQ) of accumulated mRNA were determined. The results obtained with U0126-treated samples were compared with those obtained with DMSO-treated samples. (C) Effect of ERK inhibition on viral protein translation. U0126-treated ST cells were mock infected or infected with PDCoV for 1 h and further cultivated in the presence or absence of U0126. At 12 hpi, cellular lysates were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using the antibody against the PDCoV N protein. The blot was also reacted with an anti \u03b2-actin antibody to verify equal protein loading. Viral protein expression was quantitatively estimated by densitometry and presented as the density value relative to that of the \u03b2-actin gene. U0126-treated sample results were compared to those of the vehicle control. (D) Effect of ERK inhibition on the intensity of viral protein expression. Under the same experimental conditions as in panel C, the PDCoV-infected cells were trypsinized at 12 hpi and subjected to FACS analysis using an anti-PDCoV N antibody to determine the mean fluorescence intensity. The results of U0126-treated samples were compared to those of DMSO-treated control. (E) Effect of ERK inhibition on viral progeny production. ST cells were pretreated with DMSO or U0126 for 1 h and were mock or PDCoV infected (MOI of 1). Vehicle or U0126 was present in the medium throughout the infection. At 24 hpi, virus-containing culture supernatants were collected, and PDCoV titers were determined. (F) Effect of ERK inhibition on viral growth kinetics.

Pharmacological inhibition had a detrimental effect on viral protein production at different concentrations (Fig. 8C ). Densitometric analysis of the western blots revealed that the N protein expression was dramatically downregulated by U0126, with a maximum of 80% inhibition at the highest concentration. Moreover, comparable lessened kinetics in the mean fluorescence intensity corresponding to PDCoV N protein production was confirmed in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 8D) . These data demonstrated the suppressive effect of the ERK inhibitor on viral protein expression due to its specific upstream action on viral RNA biosynthesis during PDCoV replication.",

Since PDCoV infection requires cholesterol present in both the cell membrane and the viral envelope (Jeon and Lee, 2018) , it was rational to investigate whether cholesterol plays a role in PDCoV-induced ERK activation. To answer this question, we employed M\u03b2CD, which is the most common cholesterol-sequestering agent used for plasma membranes. To examine the importance of cellular cholesterol in ERK activation, ST cells were pretreated with M\u03b2CD at various concentrations or with ethanol as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection and the compound or vehicle was present throughout infection. Based on the MTT assay results, none of the M\u03b2CD doses tested in the The U0126-treated and infected cells were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (red), fixed at 12 hpi, and independently incubated with a primary antibody against Bax or cyt c (green). The cells were then counterstained with DAPI and examined under a confocal microscope at 800\u00d7 magnification.

The inset images are enlarged versions of parts of the picture. present study caused detectable levels of cell death (data not shown). The activation levels of ERK1/2 upon M\u03b2CD treatment were measured with a FACE assay. As shown in Fig. 9A , the addition of a cholesteroldepleting compound to the target cells significantly diminished virusinduced ERK phosphorylation as well as PDCoV replication compared to that in the vehicle-treated control upon infection in a dose-dependent manner. To investigate the effect of cholesterol depletion in the viral envelope on ERK signaling, PDCoV was treated with 1 or 3 mM M\u03b2CD prior to inoculation. Likewise, the removal of cholesterol from virions resulted in a significant decrease in the amounts of activated ERK1/2 and PDCoV production (Fig. 9B ). In addition, we assured the ability of M\u03b2CD to deplete the cellular or virion cholesterol contents after treatment using a fluorescent filipin III staining (data not shown).

Accumulating evidence suggests that ERK activity is associated with apoptosis execution under certain conditions (Cagnol and Chambard, 2010) . Intriguingly, PDCoV can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of the cytochrome c (cyt c)-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, thereby facilitating viral replication in vitro . Considering our previous findings, we anticipated that the ERK cascade may function in the induction of apoptosis by PDCoV infection. Thus, we initially assessed the effect of ERK inhibition on PDCoV-triggered apoptosis using Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. ST cells were treated with DMSO or U0126 and then infected with PDCoV. At various time points post-infection, the treated and infected cells were stained with Annexin V and PI and examined with FACS analysis to quantitatively measure the percentage of viable, apoptotic, and dead cells (Fig. 10A) . Neither the vehicle nor the inhibitor tested caused significant apoptosis under our experimental conditions (top panels). Consistent with our previous study , PDCoV infection in the presence of DMSO produced a significant level of apoptosis (Annexin V positive/PI negative) at 6 hpi, and the percentage of early apoptotic cells progressively increased with infection time (middle panels). Nonetheless, pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activity failed to protect the cells from PDCoV-induced apoptotic death (bottom panels). The fraction of early apoptosis in cells treated with U0126 was comparable to that in vehicle-treated cells during the course of PDCoV infection (Fig. 10B) . Furthermore, both cytosolic-to-mitochondrial translocation of Bax and mitochondrial-tocytosolic release of cyt c, hallmarks of PDCoV-mediated apoptosis, remained unaffected in the presence of the ERK inhibitor (Lee and Lee, 2018; Fig. 10C ). Taken together, our data indicated that the ERK signaling pathway is unrelated to PDCoV-triggered apoptosis and its mechanism.",

            "text": "The understanding of the interplay between the virus and host signaling pathways has been extensively studied. In particular, the ERK cascade plays multiple significant roles in a variety of cellular functions that control cell destination, which in turn, can govern viruses that rely entirely on the host cell machinery to survive. Thus, viruses have evolved to devise general methods to take advantage of ERK signaling that benefits the viral replication machinery for optimal virus infection. However, no information is unveiled regarding the intracellular signaling pathways involved in PDCoV replication. The current study demonstrated for the first time that ERK activation is essential for the optimal replication of PDCoV in cultured cells. In this study, we found that PDCoV induces early strong and transient activation of ERK1/2 independent of maximal viral production, indicating the significance of the ERK cascade for PDCoV infection. Chemical inhibition and specific knockdown of ERK1/2 greatly impaired PDCoV propagation. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation extensively suppressed viral multiplication, particularly affecting the post-entry stages, as determined by the global down-regulation of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny release. Therefore, PDCoV was shown to manipulate the ERK signaling pathway to ensure competent viral biosynthesis and reproduction in target cells.",

            "text": "Analogous to infectious PDCoV, the UV-inactivated virus efficiently stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK and its downstream target with comparable activation profiles; therefore, ERK signaling was awakened independent of virus replication but dependent on virus entry events such as virus-receptor interaction and uncoating. Moreover, the upmost growth of PDCoV commenced at 9 hpi, as determined by the detection of a maximal amount of the viral protein, corresponding to the time when the activated status of ERK1/2 returned to the basal level or below. In contrast, total ERK1/2 levels remained steady in cells throughout infection with non-irradiated or UV-irradiated PDCoV. Altogether, the negligible production of PDCoV infection within 6 hpi is satisfactory for maximal activation of the ERK signaling pathway. These observations were comparably reproduced in porcine IPEC-J2 intestinal epithelial cells infected with infectious or UV-inactivated PDCoV, indicating that PDCoV-induced ERK signaling is cell type independent ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, other nidoviruses trigger similar ERK1/2 activation kinetics that occurs in response to virus entry, suggesting a unique feature of the ERK pathway in the nidovirus biology (Cai et al., 2007; Kim and Lee, 2015; Lee and Lee, 2010) . Although the present study did not uncover an exact mean to evoke ERK signaling following PDCoV infection, it is tempting to speculate that extracellular viruses bound to the receptor are likely responsible for ERK activation. However, we cannot exclude the activation of ERK cascades by other stimuli, including incoming virus particles through direct fusion or disassembled viral proteins and the released genome after the uncoating process.",

However, PD98059 failed to deliver the expected results, showing no suppressive effects on both ERK activation and viral propagation. This differentiating effect of each inhibitor on PDCoV replication was further corroborated in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PDCoV upon compound treatment ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). PD98059 prevents ERK1/2 activation by blocking the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, whereas U0126 is capable of not only averting the activation of MEK1/ 2 but also inhibiting MEK1/2 activity (Alessi et al., 1995; Davis et al., 2000) . Therefore, U0126 is known to be a more potent inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation than PD98059 (Favata et al., 1998) . Our findings support the distinguished ability of PD98059 and U0126 to suppress ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which correlated with their different effects on PDCoV production. However, we previously demonstrated that the two inhibitors independently hindered ERK activation induced by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), another swine enteric coronavirus, and accordingly, potently impaired PEDV replication . Considering previous and current findings, PDCoV replication seems to be less reliant on the magnitude of ERK activation than PEDV, indicating that the ERK dependence of infection differs among coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Given the knowledge gained from the present study, a feasible elucidation of how ERK1/2 activation controls PDCoV infection is that the ERK pathway may positively regulate viral multiplication directly or indirectly. Inhibition of PDCoV-provoked ERK activation remarkably waned each post-adsorption step of the viral replication process, including viral biosynthesis and subsequent release. Growing evidence indicates that the viral RNA polymerases, also called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), of positive-sense RNA viruses are phosphoproteins activated by host protein kinases, such as ERK1/2, suggesting a regulatory role of RdRp phosphorylation in viral RNA replication (Jakubiec and Jupin, 2007; Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008) . Thus, ERK1/2 activity may be crucial to phosphorylate and stabilize the PDCoV RdRp (nsp12), which could be a prerequisite for optimal viral RNA biosynthesis and later replication steps. In addition, we previously found that both cellular and viral cholesterols are key players in the entry process of PDCoV (Jeon and Lee, 2018) . Contrary to the previous study, however, despite the influence of PDCoV-induced ERK activation by cellular or virion cholesterols, the ERK signaling pathway is irrelevant to both virus attachment and internalization. These observations led us to hypothesize that the cholesterol itself present in either the cell membrane or viral envelope, rather than cholesterol-dependent viral entry, acts as a stimulus to activate the ERK signaling pathway upon PDCoV infection. On the other hand, the ERK signaling pathway is involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways by triggering mitochondrial cyt c release or caspase-8 activation, respectively (Cagnol and Chambard, 2010) . Several viruses can mediate apoptosis by activating the ERK cascade and thereby, promote their replication (Wong et al., 2005; Zampieri et al., 2007) . Although PDCoV infection is known to induce caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in vitro to favor viral replication , the current study showed no crosstalk between ERK1/2 activation and apoptosis during PDCoV infection. This finding was unanticipated because specific relocation of the mitochondrial cyt c into the cytoplasm primarily participated in the PDCoV-triggered apoptosis pathway . However, PDCoV can induce apoptotic cell death and cause the release of apoptogenic cyt c irrespective of ERK signaling, suggestive of the engagement of other host mechanisms, such as other MAPK pathways. Alternatively, ERK1/2 activation may be indirectly involved in PDCoV infection through cross-talk with other cascades to regulate the advent of other host factors that may necessitate maximal viral propagation. Furthermore, our trials on pharmacological inhibition consistently reduced but never completely eliminated PDCoV infectivity, indicating the presence of additional intracellular elements or machineries simultaneously hijacked by the invaded virus to ensure the productive survival and spread of the virus.",
