            "text": "Antiviral agents are drugs approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. The development of antiviral agents is not trivial as viral replication is intricately linked with the host cell that any antiviral drug that interferes even to a lesser extent with host cell factors may be toxic to the host depending on the duration and dosage used. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. Antiviral agents used to treat viral diseases are currently limited, and at least half of the available agents are for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others are used for the management of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and influenza virus-related diseases.",

An ideal antiviral agent should be effective against both actively replicating and latent viruses; however, most of the available antiviral agents are only effective against replicating viruses. The goals for treating acute viral infections in immunocompetent patients are to reduce the severity of the illness and its complications and to decrease the rate of transmission of the virus. The therapeutic index, or ratio of efficacy to toxicity, must be extremely high in order for the therapy to be acceptable. For chronic viral infections, the goal is to prevent viral damage to visceral organs, and therefore efficacy becomes paramount. Antiviral agents can be used for prophylaxis, suppression, preemptive therapy, or treatment of overt disease. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In addition, host phenotypic behaviors toward antiviral drugs because of either genomic or epigenetic factors could limit the efficacy of an antiviral agent in an individual. This article summarizes the most relevant pharmacologic and clinical properties of the available antiviral agents.",

            "text": "Acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine] is a synthetic acyclic purine nucleoside analogue that lacks the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group of nucleosides. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate metabolite that inhibits viral DNA synthesis (Figure 1\n). Viral encoded thymidine kinases (TK), present in only herpesvirus-infected cells, catalyze the phophorylation to acyclovir monophosphate. Host cell TK or other kinases cannot phosphorylate acyclovir to its monophosphate metabolite efficiently. Acyclovir is highly selective for cells engaged in active viral replication and does not affect noninfected cells. The monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated to the di-, and triphosphate by cellular kinases, resulting in acyclovir triphosphate concentrations much higher in HSV-infected than in uninfected cells. Acyclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, as illustrated in Figure 1. Since acyclovir triphosphate lacks the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group required for DNA chain elongation, the growing chain of DNA is terminated. In addition, the incorporated acyclovir can trap viral DNA polymerase and prevent it from initiating other viral DNA replication. The viral polymerase has a greater affinity for acyclovir triphosphate than cellular DNA polymerase, resulting in little incorporation of acyclovir into cellular DNA. In vitro, acyclovir is most active against HSV-1 (average EC50\n = 0.04 \u03bcg ml\u2212 1), HSV-2 (0.10 \u03bcg ml\u2212 1), and VZV (0.50 \u03bcg ml\u2212 1). Varicella virus is much less susceptible to acyclovir than is HSV, and hence, higher doses of acyclovir are required in the treatment of VZV infections. EBV TK has poor efficiency to utilize acyclovir as substrate, therefore, higher acyclovir concentrations are required for EBV inhibition. CMV, which lacks a virus-specific TK, is relatively resistant.",

Oral acyclovir therapy when initiated within 24 h of the onset of the rash reduces the duration of fever, and the number of maximum lesions in immunocompetent children. At present, the clinical importance of acyclovir treatment in otherwise healthy children, in whom chicken pox is self-limiting and results in few complications, remains uncertain.

The triphosphate metabolite then serves as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The active form of the drug exhibits a 25- to 50-fold greater affinity for the viral DNA polymerase, compared with the cellular DNA polymerase, thereby selectively inhibiting viral replication. Owing to its unique phosphorylation requirements for activation, cidofovir usually maintains activity against acyclovir- and foscarnet-resistant HSV isolates, as well as ganciclovir- and foscarnet-resistant CMV mutants. Cidofovir is less potent than acyclovir in vitro; however, cidofovir persists in cells for prolonged periods, increasing drug activity. In addition, cidofovir produces active metabolites with long half-lives (17\u201348 h), permitting once weekly dosing. Cidofovir has in vitro activity against VZV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-8, HPV, polyomaviruses, orthopoxviruses, and adenovirus.

Rimantadine is fourfold to tenfold more active than amantadine. The mechanism of action of these drugs relates to the influenza A virus M2 protein, an integral transmembrane protein that functions as an ion channel for this virus and is activated by pH. The drop in pH accompanying the hydrogen flux facilitates the dissociation of the M2 protein from the ribonucleoprotein complexes so that the ribonucleoprotein can enter the cell nucleus and initiate replication. By interfering with the function of the M2 protein, amantadine and rimantadine inhibit the acid-mediated dissociation of the matrix protein from the ribonuclear protein complex within endosomes. This event occurs early in the viral replication cycle. The consequences of these drugs are the potentiation of acidic pH-induced conformational changes in the viral hemagglutinin during its intracellular transport.",

Each type of IFN can be produced through recombinant DNA technology. The binding of IFN to the intact cell membrane is the first step in establishing an antiviral effect. IFN binds to the cellular receptors and activates secondary messengers to initiate production of multiple proteins, which are pivotal for the defense of the cell against viruses. The mechanism of action is rather complex (Thomas et al., 2003). The antiviral effects of IFN include degradation of viral mRNA, inhibition of viral protein synthesis, and prevention of the viral infection of cells. The immunomodulating effects of IFN include enhancement of antigen presentation by HLA I and II to the immune system, activation of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells, and increased cytokine production.

Entecavir is efficiently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active triphosphate metabolite. It affects three-steps in the replication of HBV: (1) prevent the priming of the HBV reverse transcriptase, (2) prevent reverse transcribing of the HBV pregenomic mRNA, and (3) inhibits DNA-dependent DNA synthesis (i.e., terminating viral DNA synthesis) (Seifer et al., 1998, Zoulim, 2006). The HBV polymerase binds preferentially to entecavir triphosphate, and entecavir triphosphate does not affect human mitochondrial DNA synthesis. The effect of entecavir on human cellular polymerase is minimal. Studies prior to approval of entecavir for HBV treatment suggested that entecavir did not have anti-HIV activity at clinical relevant concentrations. However, recent studies have suggested an anti-HIV activity of entecavir at drug concentrations in the low nanomolar range (Mcmahon et al., 2007, Sasadeusz, 2007).",

The first step in the conversion of abacavir to its active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate, is phosphorylation to abacavir monophosphate by adenosine phosphotransferase. This step is followed by deamination by a cytosolic enzyme to form carbovir monophosphate, which undergoes two subsequent phosphorylations, to the diphosphate by guanylate kinase and to the triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinase and other enzymes. Carbovir triphosphate competes with endogenous 2\u2032-dGTP for incorporation into the nucleic acid chain, and after incorporation, terminates DNA chain elongation.

            "text": "New drug discovery strategies attempt at circumventing the current drug resistant problem by focusing on either novel targets or new compounds capable of suppressing HIV strains that are resistant to current inhibitors. There are several nucleoside analogues in preclinical and clinical studies. Notably are the novel 4\u2032-substituted thymidine analogues with potent antiviral activity and less cytotoxic (Yang et al., 2006). An example is the recently discovered 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-3\u2032-deoxy-4\u2032-ethynylthymidine, structurally related to stavudine, is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication and is much less inhibitory to mitochondrial DNA synthesis and cell growth in cell cultures than its progenitor stavudine. The triphosphate metabolite accumulates in cells much longer than stavudine, and exerts persistent antiviral activity even after removal of drug from culture (Paintsil et al., 2007). It also has a unique resistance profile when compared to other thymidine analogues and maintains activity against multidrug resistant HIV strains. There is increasing number of compounds discovered as anti-HIV agents targeted at virtually any step in the replicative cycle of the virus and novel targets in development.",
