In addition, pathogens are getting resistant to drugs controlling them. In this paper we establish a new population dynamical system of infectious diseases including drug treatment. We take into account both sensitive and resistant parasites. The unknown model parameters are fitted based on a set of data for malaria from Cisse, Burkina Faso. The fitted model is used to investigate the influence of drug treatment on drug resistance. Based on these investigations, treatment strategies to reduce drug resistance can be elaborated.",

Historically, there has been a lot of research on this disease, see [5, 7, 13] and references therein. However, up to now it is very difficult to obtain satisfactory malaria models. In general, before modeling authors have their own questions. They would then call a new model to be \"good enough\" if it is able to answer their questions. One of the challenges with malaria is that it comes together with Anopheles mosquitoes and parasites-Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae. Their organisms are much more complex compared to other pathogens with single-cell or even simpler-such as bacteria, archaea, viruses, etc. This can also partly explain why there are only few mathematical models concerning drug treatment in malaria.",

They have a better chance to survive after natural selection and maintain their best genetic system.

Here the authors described a model of hosts and vectors dealing with both resistant and sensitive strains. In these papers and also some other cases, authors focus on analyzing the models to establish positive equilibrium and studying their stability under certain assumptions. Although in [6] the authors tried numerical simulation, they said that the model needed to be validated using realistic epidemiological data.

Every new offspring goes to the susceptible class. Like other epidemic models, we use common denotations for the natural birth rates of susceptible, infected, recovered human classes b 1s ; b 1i ; b 1r . Also as convention, mortality rate of H 1s is denoted by m 1s , infection rate by i 1 and re-susceptibility rate by r (individuals from recovered class H 1r after a certain time come back to susceptible class H 1s ). Values of m 1s ; i 1 are given in the next section and r is an unknown parameter which can be found after fitting the data. The dynamic equation of the susceptible human population is the following: , which implies that there are too many vectors so that they have to compete with each other to get successful contact to humans (e.g., obtain a blood meal in case of malaria). This is a quite usual situation in Africa, where the tropical climate is suitable for vector (mosquito) development. Although mainly infected female Anopheles mosquitoes can transmit malaria, they still have to compete with other un-infected mosquitoes to get blood meals. On the other hand, the size of the mosquito population induces a corresponding protection force from human side. Concerning additional details for parameter r, we are aware that different drugs have different half-lives. They partly remain inside human bodies after treatment and provide the same protection as immunity. Medically, we consider five times of drug half-life equal to wash-out time. When drug is washed out and immunity is no longer active, the person returns to the susceptible class. This process is modeled by formula r D k r r 0 , where r 0 D OEmax.T; d / 1 , T is natural immune duration, d is drug wash-out duration; k r is a scalar factor subject to estimation. After fitting, we use this formula for control simulation, with the controllable parameter d .",

With Human Land Capture method, volunteers caught many more mosquitoes in rainy months while just a few in the other months [11] . In the same time, the value of k r has a big drop, indicating that there are almost no recovered people that come back to susceptible class. In malaria, no recovery or complete clearance is expected in a short period of time. We should also mention that patients with low parasite densities sometime are not detected and can be considered healthy. In fact, the parasite density develops slowly and symptoms appear in patients after few weeks or much later than the exposure to mosquitoes. This explains why the peak of selection force of resistance also comes later than the intensive treatment period, this is expressed in the last parameter k d in Fig. 4. ",

Their results turn out to be quite similar. As result of the treatment, the sensitive parasite population is changed much faster than the resistant one. Simulation in Fig. 5 shows that the proportion of infected humans receiving full medical treatment is very essential in disease control. In addition, the figure indicates that at least a certain proportion of the population needs to be treated properly in order to avoid deadly clinical malaria in the case of very high density of parasites.

We can keep both the sensitive and resistant parasite populations under control. The resistant parasite population is relatively small, as we see with Artesunate treatment in the lower panel of Fig. 8 . On the upper panel, combined control leads to noticeable change in the infected human population. The treatment efficacies are close to the values of antimalarial drugs taken from Asia, especially Vietnam. They are based on a report by WHO in [17] . Note that in the Burkina Faso setting, most of the antimalarial medication would begin with high efficacy-since most of the people living in the rural regions have had no access to them before. Figure 9 using logarithmic scale, lets us easily see that there are big differences between Chloroquine, Sunfadioxine-pyrimethamine, Mefloquine and Artesunate. In the first three drugs, parasite resistance levels in the last period are very high. In contrast, with Artesunate or the similar Artemisinin Combination Therapy, the regimens are still effective, they keep parasite resistance low.",

However, we need them avoid the high (sensitive) parasite density in infected humans, e.g. to keep the average parasite density in human blood below a specific level. Here our model can serve as the potential basis for the control problems, providing an optimal strategy of treatment. We can optimize the proportion (or number) of infected human population which need to be treated with full doses. -In case of malaria, our model simulations suggest that parasite mutation and drug adaptation both play big roles in resistance. In quantitative sense, the simulation shows that: when drug with long half-life is employed, drug adaption is dominant. This is not the case with short half-life drugs. So the shorter the drug half-life is, the fewer resistant parasites are newly created. -For the first time of treatment, our simulations show that the outcome of different drug treatments are quite similar. It is explained by the fact that in Burkina Faso, not many people have access to treatment. Most of the drugs are too expensive for the region, especially in a village like Cisse, where our data come from. That is why in Burkina Faso or similar regions in Africa, treatment can start with any drug and later switch to a new therapy when the resistant pathogens to the old drugs become dominant. This shows clearly efficacy since most of the parasites which resist to the old drug are sensitive to the new one.",

From the perspective of infectious diseases, vectors are the transmitters of disease-causing organisms that carry the pathogens from one host to another[14]. That's why a disease belonging to the second group is called a vector-borne disease.As we discussed before, we would like to model dynamics of pathogen, vector and human populations. We consider two hosts: number of humans denoted by H 1 and vectors denoted by H 2 . The pathogens within human hosts are denoted by P . Like in the classical case, there are three compartments for human hosts which we call susceptible H 1s , infected H 1i , recovered H 1r . We have two compartments for vector hosts H 2s , H 2i -susceptible and infected. Since drugs are employed, there are two compartments for pathogens, non-resistant and resistant P n , P r , respectively. All transmissions among the seven groups are described inFig. 1.",
