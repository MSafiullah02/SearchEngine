In particular, using data up to around the time that the rate of deaths 24 reaches a maximum, these models provide estimates for the time that a plateau will be reached 25 signifying that the epidemic is approaching its end, as well as for the cumulative number of deaths 26 at that time.

            "text": "unprecedented mobilization of the scientific community has already led to remarkable progress 38 towards combating this threat, such as understanding significant features of the virus at the 39 molecular level, see for example (1) and (2). In addition, international efforts have intensified 40 towards the development of specific pharmacological interventions; they include, clinical trials 41 using old or relatively new medications and the employment of specific monoclonal antibodies, as to viruses, and that complement deposits are abundant in the lung biopsies from SARS-CoV-2 48 patients indicating that this system is presumably overacting (6), it has been suggested that anti-49 complement therapies may be beneficial to SARS-CoV-2 patients. Further support for this 50 suggestion is provided by earlier studies showing that the activation of various components of the 51 complement system exacerbates the acute respiratory distress syndrome disease associated with 52 SARS-CoV (6). The Federal Drug Administration of USA has granted a conditional approval to 53 the anti-viral medication Remdesivir (7). Unfortunately, the combination of the anti-viral 54 medications lopinavir and ritonavir that are effective against the human immunodeficiency virus 55 has not shown any benefits (4). Similarly, the combination of the anti-malarial medication 56 hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, is not only ineffective but can be harmful (5). 57 The scientific community is also playing an important role in advising policy makers of possible 58 non-pharmacological approaches to limit the catastrophic impact of the pandemic. For example, 59 following the analysis in (8) of two possible strategies, called mitigation and suppression, for 60 combating the epidemic, UK switched from mitigation to suppression. Within this context, in order 61 to design a long-term strategy, it is necessary to be able to predict important features of the COVID-62 19 epidemic, such as the final accumulative number of deaths. Clearly, this requires the 63 development of predictive mathematical models. 64 In a recent paper (9) we presented a model for the dynamics of the accumulative number of 65 individuals in a given country that are reported at time t to be infected by COVID-19. This model 66 is based on a particular ordinary differential equation of the Riccati type, which is specified by a In the particular case that the associate time-dependent function is a constant, the explicit solution 76 of the above Riccati equation becomes the classical logistic formula. It was shown in (9) that 77 although this formula provides an adequate fit of the given data, is not sufficiently accurate for 78 predictive purposes. In order to provide more accurate predictions, we introduced two novel 79 models, called rational and birational.",

It is evident from the above that whereas each of the three equations (3) The fact that a is now a function of t has important implications.

In any case, whatever strategy is followed, it is natural to expect that the number of reported 248 infected individuals as well as the number of deaths will begin to grow. At this stage the predictions 249 of the models proposed in (9) and here will not be valid. However, these works will still be valuable: 250 they can be used to compute the additional number of reported infected individuals and deaths 251 caused by easing the lockdown measures. Let us hope that a prudent exit strategy is adopted so that 252 these numbers will not be staggering. The stability of the fitting procedure was established by using the following simple criterion: 272 different fitting attempts based on the use of a fixed number of data points, must yield curves which 273 have the same form beyond the above fixed points. In this way, it was established that the rational 274 formula could be employed provided that data were available until around the time T, whereas the 275 birational formula could be used only for data available well beyond T.",

The birational formula can be employed only after the curve approaches its sigmoidal part 104 (a precise criterion of when the birational can be used is discussed in the methods section). For this105    reason, at the present time the birational formula cannot be used for predictions applicable to depicts the total number of deaths as a function of time after the day that 25 days had occurred,109    for the epidemics in South Korea, Italy, Spain, France, UK, Germany, and USA.110  111    In this work we implemented the following tasks: (i) We determined the parameters specifying the 112 logistic, rational, and birational formulas using the above data until May 1,2020. In this way it 113 becomes evident that each of these models can fit the data. (ii) We also determined the parameters 114 of the above models using data only a subset of the data. Then, by comparing the predictions of the 115 resulting formulas with the remaining actual data it becomes clear that the rational and birational 116 models generate more accurate predictions.

This is further 194 scrutinized inFig. 4, where using the epidemic data from Italy, Spain, and France trained with data 195 only until T+15, we compared the predictions of the resulting formulas with the actual data at later 196 dates. For the trained data set, T+15 corresponds to t=50, t=43 and t=48, for Italy, Spain, and France,197    respectively. It is clear that each of the 3 models gives a different curve. Furthermore, for Italy (Fig. 198 4A) and Spain (Fig. 4B) the birational model provides an upper bound of the actual N(t), whereas 199 the rational model provides a lower bound which is better estimate than the one obtained via the 200 logistic model. Regarding the birational model, for the cases of Italy and Spain the uppermost 201 curves were obtained by using X=T. For France we experimented with different values of X for the 202 birational model. For all such values, the birational curve was always above the rational curve; in 203 order to obtain a curve that is above the actual N(t) for France (so that the resulting formula could 204 perhaps yield an upper bound), it was necessary to choose X=T-3. Remarkably, the same result was 205 obtained in (9) when examining an uppermost bound for the number of reported models elucidating aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic have already appeared in the 210 literature, including(10-19).

This equation is specified by the 214 constant Nf and the function \u03b1(t). Although this Riccati equation is a nonlinear ordinary differential 215 equation containing time dependent coefficients, it can be solved in closed form. For appropriately 216 chosen functions \u03b1(t), the solution provides a flexible generalization of the classical logistic formula 217 of equation (1) that has been employed in a great variety of applications, including the modelling 218 of infectious processes.219",

Following this expected decline of the \"first wave\" of infections, it is now contemplated that 243 the lockdown measures will be eased. This appears vital, not only for economical but also for health 244 considerations. Indeed, the psychological impact on the population at large of the current situation 245 is substantial (20); furthermore, it is expected to worsen, especially due to the effect of the post-246 traumatic disorder.

We arranged the data in the form of deaths, N, over time measured in 258 days, after the day that the number of deaths reached 25. 259 Throughout this paper, the unknown parameters were determined by employing the simplex 260 algorithm. This is based on an iterative procedure that does not need information regarding the 261 derivative of the function under consideration. The simplex algorithm is particularly effective for 262 cases where the gradient of the likelihood functions is not easy to calculate. The algorithm creates 263 a 'random' simplex of n + 1 points, where n is the number of the model parameters that need to be 264 estimated. The constrained variation of the simplex algorithm (23, 24) available in MATLAB \u00ae was 265 used for all models; an L1-norm was employed in the likelihood function to improve robustness 266 (25). Random parameter initializations were used to avoid local minima. The simplex algorithm 267 was chosen because it performed better than the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting algorithms 268 evaluated in this work, namely, the Levenberg-Marquardt (26) and the trust-",
