Hyphema can be the result of numerous disease processes that may disrupt the blood-ocular barrier, including trauma, coagulopathies, neoplasia, infectious diseases, systemic hypertension, congenital anomalies, uveitis, retinal detachments, and immune-mediated diseases.1, 4 Severe sequelae to hyphema commonly include cataract formation, phthisis bulbi, secondary glaucoma, corneal blood staining, and posterior synechiae.2 Although there are many known traumatic and nontraumatic causes of hyphema, finding the underlying cause and treating the condition can still be rather difficult, especially in emergency situations. This review highlights the most common etiologies associated with hyphema and provides guidelines to approach hyphema both diagnostically and therapeutically.",

These patients may present with severe clinical signs such as skull fractures or inappropriate mentation or more inconspicuous clinical signs, such as hyphema. Protection by the bony orbit and soft tissues surrounding the eye reduces the chance of hyphema, although trauma directly in the area of the orbit or soft tissues may result in damage to the globe and uveal tissues4, 5, 6 (\nFig 2). A study investigated traumatic ocular proptosis in 84 dogs and cats and included patients suffering from dog bites, vehicular accidents, animal fights, and unknown trauma. Hyphema was the second most common ocular finding in cats presenting for ocular proptosis, and was found in some of the more severe canine cases.6 Hyphema is generally considered to be a poor prognostic indicator in patients with proptosis, resulting in enucleation in most cases. Another study investigated traumatic hyphema in animals and found they had suffered gunshot wounds, canine bites, vehicular impacts, feline scratches, and blunt trauma from a closing door, a horse kick, a high-rise fall, and a rock thrown from a lawn mower. These cases had hyphema that inhibited ophthalmic examination beyond the iris, and ocular ultrasonography was performed to investigate other ocular abnormalities.5 This is especially important because retinal detachment can result from blunt force trauma to the eye and lead to hyphema.",

The prevalence and severity of ocular lesions with thrombocytopenia cases have been found to be more significant than ocular lesions associated with anemia cases.11 Because platelets play such a vital role in primary hemostasis, a platelet deficiency can easily lead to ocular hemorrhage, including hyphema and subconjunctival, retinal, or intravitreal hemorrhage (\nFig 4). Secondary ocular diseases, such as glaucoma or uveitis, often follow these bleeding events.11 Determination of the etiology of thrombocytopenia is important, as treatment of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia involves the use of glucocorticoids, which can inhibit diagnosis of underlying disease processes such as lymphoma. Glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive dosages can also worsen certain infectious diseases.8, 12 For these reasons, further investigation of thrombocytopenia should be performed in all patients presenting with hyphema to properly manage the underlying cause.",

The neovascularization is most likely due to angiogenic stimulating factors triggered by hypoxia.

It is important to investigate parasite control as well. Acquiring a complete list of current and past medications is essential, as these medications may be contributing to the hyphema.36 Potentiated sulfonamides have been reported to cause uveitis and hyphema in human and canine patients37 (\nFig 8).

Complete hyphema results from the entire anterior chamber being filled with blood and is usually seen with acute hemorrhage.36 Hyphema may appear differently depending on the underlying cause. When evaluating the blood, it is important to note whether the blood is clotted in the anterior chamber or if it remains unclotted. If the blood is clotted, a traumatic or infectious cause is more likely, whereas if the blood is not clotted, a bleeding abnormality should be moved higher on the differential list. Bleeds resulting from detached retinas, neoplasia, or congenital ocular abnormalities may appear clotted or unclotted depending on the severity and duration of the bleed.1 When the blood obscures evaluation of the intraocular structures, ocular ultrasonography should be used to evaluate these structures (see the Diagnostic Imaging section).2\n",

Systemic corticosteroids such as prednisone may also be used to prevent reoccurrence of hemorrhage if they are not contraindicated in a patient.1, 2, 5, 43 Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used to treat uveitis to decrease inflammation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally avoided when treating hyphema because they interfere with platelet function and may actually cause more bleeding to occur.1, 5, 36, 43\n",

In general, animals with retinal disease including retinal detachment or vitreal, choroidal, or retinal hemorrhages have a grave to poor prognosis for vision.1, 2, 36 In cases of uncomplicated hyphema with small volumes of blood, the condition may take up to 1 week to disappear; however, if the hyphema persists or recurs, further diagnostics should be performed to investigate another possible underlying diagnosis. Enucleation should be performed in animals when neoplasia is of primary concern; however, further diagnostics such as thoracic and abdominal radiographs should be performed to look for metastasis. When metastasis is noted, the prognosis is worse, although enucleation may still provide some comfort and palliative treatment for the patient.1, 2, 36 Animals with chronic hyphema usually suffer from secondary complications such as glaucoma, and the prognosis for vision is usually poor.1 In patients with smaller amounts of hyphema that do not have significantly increased IOP, treatment should be implemented and prognosis should be reassessed when the hyphema has resolved and an accurate assessment of the integrity of the intraocular structures can be made.1, 36 These patients have the best prognosis for vision.",

Several underlying diseases are commonly associated with intraocular hemorrhage, including trauma, neoplasia, infectious disease, bleeding abnormalities, congenital abnormalities, retinal detachment, systemic hypertension, and anterior uveitis. Because these etiologies are complex and very different, obtaining a detailed history and performing a thorough physical and ocular examination are essential to determine the most likely cause of the hyphema. Additional diagnostic testings including CBC, serum chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation panel, radiography, and ultrasonography are helpful in determining an underlying cause and giving an accurate prognosis for vision and comfort. A full ophthalmic examination including tonometry and fluorescein staining should be performed before starting the therapy. The most common empirical therapy includes topical or systemic corticosteroids and mydriatics. Additional treatments with TPA and aminocaproic acid have also been described in particular cases. Protecting the eye from sequelae, specifically glaucoma or chronic uveitis, is a vital part of treatment to decrease discomfort and preserve vision. If an underlying cause or systemic illness is found during diagnosis, treatment of that underlying disease is crucial for the overall health of the patient.",
