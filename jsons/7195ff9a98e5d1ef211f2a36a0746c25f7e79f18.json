This demand for robust point-of-care (POC) diagnostics is further driven by the increasing burden of drug-resistant diseases, concern for food and water safety, and bioterrorism, among many other necessities. As has been discussed in previous chapters, paper-based tests provide a simple and compelling solution to such needs. Paper-based tests and devices are themselves not new and in fact were first developed in the 1930s [1], but have only emerged recently as broadly capable tools for rapid diagnostics outside of laboratory settings.",

This one-step assay to assess urine for the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin uses the chromatographic effect of paper to drive flow for the onboard immunoassay that underpins detection. While the pregnancy test has been a tremendous success, many other clinical needs require portable diagnostics that are similarly complex and sensitive and, in turn, this has given birth to a whole field dedicated to the development of paper-based, POC diagnostics [3] . Accordingly, the lateral flow assay concept has been extended to a wide range of infectious disease antigens, nucleic acid sequences, and illicit drugs from diverse sample types (e.g., sputum, blood, fecal, food).",

Here we survey some of the most recent and innovative paper-based diagnostics and the technologies that surround them, in hopes of helping to define what would be an ideal device. Accordingly, we review the areas of ongoing tool development, such as sample handling and preparation, sensitivity, and signal amplification, to frame our discussion and share advances in the field. However, the sensing modality employed in a device in many ways defines the challenges along the developmental path. Therefore, we will often discuss tool development for paper-based devices using antibody-based detection and those using nucleic acid amplification separately. This will be followed by a discussion of key technical aspects that we believe will lead the future directions of POC diagnostics, and then look at how, as a community, the vision of low cost and accessible diagnostics can be realized.",

A recent study compared 13 different commercially available or close-to-market POC devices and found that in more than half of them the sample preparation was not included [9] . Further, as late as in 2016, a review from Tang et al. highlighted the fact that most analyte extraction methods require either an external electrical power, an external pump, or multiple steps [10] . In POC settings, the processing of biological samples for diagnostics is a critical challenge complicated by the diversity and the intrinsic complexity of patient samples (e.g., blood, saliva, urine). These challenges begin with the sample collection and require the development of a workflow to separate, extract, and often amplify the analyte of interest for the paper-based diagnostic system. Each step needs to be considered as part of the whole workflow and in the context of sample, patient, and environmental factors [11] . Below we discuss each of the sample preparation steps and explore how engineering efforts are advancing sample preparation in the pursuit of the ideal paper-based device.",

The technique is widely used for monitoring blood glucose in POC settings and more recently has been used to explore among others early innate transcriptomic responses generated over time after vaccination [13] .

Importantly, sputum samples are not saliva samples, which contain large amount of oral bacteria [23] that can contaminate sputum [24] . This complex mixture is part of the immune system that functions as a natural barrier to infection and as such is an interesting fluid to study. The value of sputum as a diagnostic fluid has even been demonstrated through the monitoring of color changes that have been correlated with lung cancer, and bacterial or viral infections. A particularly relevant use of sputum samples in diagnostics has proven to be tuberculosis. Here nucleic acid-based POC tests have been developed for the detection of tuberculosis, efficacy of treatment, and determination of coinfection with HIV [25, 26] [27, 28].",

While in their study membranes clogged at concentrations of below that of whole blood, they demonstrated that on-site dilution of patient samples would be a simple and easily implemented solution.

This concept was recently extended by using heat and the high surface area of paper to augment evaporation for the concentration of analytes in urine [44] . This creative approach was effective at a 20-fold concentration of a urine biomarker (TB-related glycolipid lipoarabinomannan) and it would be interesting to know if a similar approach could be used to concentrate nucleic acids.

Laboratory-based processing of sputum samples for diagnostics involves chemical (mucolytic agents) or mechanical (sonication, vortexing) liquefaction prior to nucleic acid tests [46] . Very few portable systems have yet to be developed for mucus separation and sample extraction. One exciting example is the Cepheid GeneXpert technology that uses an automated cartridge for the ultrasonic lysis of organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis captured in a filter. This is followed by PCR-based detection of the pathogen and determination of rifampicin resistance [25, 47] . However the cost of the Cepheid Xpert instrument is not trivial, with a unit cost of at least $17,000 USD [48, 49] . A Phase I SBIR clinical trial has also recently been reported for the development of a new automated POC cassette for processing of sputum samples for nucleic acid extraction; however, the associated costs have yet to be reported (https://www.sbir. gov/sbirsearch/detail/706169). A recent study offers a potentially more accessible and minimally instrumented approach. Here sputum is disinfected and liquefied and then pathogen is mechanically lysed using a battery-operated bead beater. Using this approach DNA could be isolated for qPCR (or POC diagnostics) from spiked TB cultures in under 10 min [26] .",

Boiling water is something that is almost universally available and a simple 40-s boiling water bath has been demonstrated to release cellular contents without damage to nucleic acids [51] . Similar results have been reported for the lysis of virus [52] [53] [54] . Often the thermal lysis of pathogens is sufficient and lysates can be loaded directly into the diagnostic workflow or analytical device. For example, the thermal lysis of bacterial cells in PCR buffer, followed by PCR amplification and sizing, was performed on a reusable chip in 1998 [55] . More recently, extraction and isolation of Vibrio cholerae from fecal samples were performed using solar-thermal energy. Here, without the need of external electrical power, a stable temperature of 95 \u2022 C was achieved in less than 5 min [56] .",

Some of the most commonly used enzyme-based approaches are proteases or lysozyme, which are highly effective but do have limitations for POC applications when pathogen identity is not known. For example, in the case of lysozyme, some bacterial species (e.g., Staphylococcus sp.) have evolved resistance to the glycoside hydrolase in response to the enzyme's role as an antimicrobial in the innate immune system [57] . An interesting alternative without this limitation is the bacteriolytic enzyme achromopeptidase (ACP; [58, 59] ). As with other proteases this enzyme can cause problems with downstream nucleic acid amplification reactions; however, ACP activity is labile to heat (>80 \u2022 C) so can be easily inactivated, allowing for subsequence molecular steps to be done without purification of nucleic acids. Importantly, ACP is stable dry-stored for easy POC distribution [60, 61] .",

Comprised of glass oxide fibers, the membrane has high affinity for DNA and thus serves as a capture agent to allow simple processing steps. Once lysed, the coated membrane is rinsed with NaOH to remove inhibitory proteins (e.g., hemoglobin). The residual NaOH does not inhibit downstream steps and so the DNA-bound membrane can be transferred directly to qPCR for analysis. Authors have demonstrated this approach in processing HIVcontaining blood samples, where it has yielded sensitive and specific results for the detection of the virus [64] [65] [66] .

Specificity is the measure of the rate at which devices report the correct results and is similarly of great importance because of the implications for false diagnosis. The ideal rate of specificity accordingly is 100%. These two features, sensitivity and specificity, often work against each other as is seen in the reciprocal effect observed between lateral flow speed and sensitivity [88] (Millipore). While challenging, the development of tools with high sensitivity and specificity is critical to extending the reach of lab-grade diagnostics globally and has tremendous potential for public health.",

For many applications, providing clinically relevant sensitivity in either of these modes will likely require the inclusion of simple equipment into the diagnostic workflow.

AuNPs are very stable, which enables distribution and storage either in solution or in a dry powder and, despite the value of gold material itself, only extremely small amounts of the AuNPs are needed for detection. Gold nanoparticles are also easily functionalized with antibodies and other biomolecules and do not fade with exposure to light [103, 104] . Most importantly however, AuNPs have unique optical and electrical properties that make them useful as both visual and electrochemical outputs for diagnostics. The optical properties of AuNPs include a deep color that ranges from deep red to blue, depending on their diameter, that allows for diagnostic outputs to be read directly by the naked eye [103, 105] . For electrochemical assays, antigen-antibody interactions can be used to recruit AuNPs to electrodes, which augments the conductivity of electrode surfaces for diagnostic detection [106] .",

However to address some of their limitations, other molecular tools are also being brought to bear in an effort to increase sensitivity, improve specificity, and add new molecular capabilities. Recent work from the field of synthetic biology has contributed to this effort. This includes work of ours, and that of colleagues, with the development of a paper-based diagnostic platform that operates using an isothermal transcription and translation reaction. The approach uses a new type of riboregulator, called a toehold switch, as a diagnostic RNA sensor. The necessary enzymes and DNA encoding the toehold switch are embedded into paper and freeze-dried to allow storage and distribution without refrigeration [132, 133] . The freeze-dried paper device is activated by rehydration and the toehold switch DNA is transcribed to form an RNA hairpin at the 5 end of a reporter mRNA. In the presence of target RNA, the hairpin of the toehold switch becomes linear, which allows ribosomes to bind for the translation of a reporter enzyme. Here the translation of the \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme catalyzes a visible color change on the paper in as little as 20 min after rehydration. As part of the proof-of-concept work, diagnostics for the strain-specific detection of the Ebola virus (Zaire vs. Sudan) and antibiotic resistance were demonstrated.",

This led to a follow-up work in May 2016 that reported a portable molecular diagnostic for the Zika virus [54] . The similarity between Zika and Dengue viruses causes cross-reactivity in serological assays for patient antibodies and so, with the outbreak in Latin America, there was great need for a portable molecular diagnostic for the virus. To solve the challenge with sensitivity, isothermal amplification was added in the workflow upstream of the toehold switch. By combining isothermal amplification with the toehold switch, not only was there an increase in signal amplification and sensitivity, but importantly this also addressed the general problem of false positives for isothermal amplification. In this configuration the detection of isothermal amplification products is now contingent on the second sequence-dependent toehold switching event for a paper-based color change.",

This is an important feature that accounts for the constant evolutionary drift in pathogen genomes, meaning that toehold switches designed for first sequenced American strain of the Zika virus (2016) are also, in theory, capable of detecting all strains of the virus since its discovery in 1947 while still distinguishing from closely related Dengue virus isotypes.",

Having demonstrated these paper-based Zika diagnostics with live virus and infected plasma, work is continuing in a patient and field trial in Latin America to solve the challenges of deployment. Follow-on work by the Collins and Zhang labs has further extended these capabilities with new work that relies on a different Cas protein.

Urban populations are in great need of accessible diagnostics outside of hospitals, and we would argue that such applications can help to catalyze the long-term aspiration of complete independence from equipment.

With the rise of Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other DIY components, as well as provider-subsided mobile phones, the requirement for equipment does not necessarily mean expensive. This argument is further underscored by the complexity and presumable price of equipment-free, disposable all-in-one cartridgetype diagnostics. While such cartridge-based diagnostics may provide a promising option for unmet needs in countries where governments and health insurance cover the cost, global health applications are not likely able to bear the cost even when concessional prices are applied [49] .

Just as molecular technologies and nanomaterials promise to replace equipment by providing lower temperature diagnostic regimes and signal amplification, DMF promises to dramatically simplify low-cost fluid handling and automation of complexity. Through an array of patterned electrodes, DMF uses the application of an electrical field to dispense, move, and mix microdroplets (pico-to microliters) in a chip [147] . While most microfluidic devices rely on external pressure sources, pumps, continuous flow, and large amount of samples or reagents, DMF technology enables savings in reagents, sample, and therefore cost. In 2004, Srinivasan et al. [148] were able to actuate by electrowetting, human physiological samples like whole human blood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat, and tear as well as perform a glucose assay. The flexibility of DMF enables functions like sample separation and extraction, for example, with the use of mixing areas with lytic agents or heating zone on a single device. In 2009 Mousa et al. [149] successfully separated and extracted estradiol from breast tissue, whole blood, and serum and in 2015 Ng et al. [150] presented a proof of concept for the use of DMF as a diagnostic platform for detection of infectious diseases. The demonstration was performed with a fully integrated sample preparation for the detection of rubella infection. The shoeboxsized automated platform was able to aliquot, dilute, and multiplex four parallel assays as well as deliver an automated digital readout of the assay. Recent work has combined DMF with paper (paper-DMF) to create cheap, fast, complex, and multiplexed diagnostic devices [151] using conductive silver ink on paper.",

Thus, the paper-DMF platform can provide sequential flow of the sample and reagents, as well as complex multistep processes, without any intervention of the user.

However, as paper-based diagnostic capabilities grow, an automated, anonymized electronic reporting becomes possible, and \"what if\" paper devices could allow large epidemiological studies through citizen science? Such studies could be health related, but they could also aid with monitoring disease vectors (e.g., ducks for influenza), environmental factors, etc. [89, 155] . \u2022 \"What if\" paper devices (low-cost technology) and citizen science could make a shift from responding to illness to anticipating disease with early detection and health monitoring? \u2022 Recent work reports electrically activated paper actuators that fold and bend in response to an applied current [156] . \"What if\" paper-based diagnostic devices could move on their own, following a preprogrammed sequence of movements, to complete a diagnostic workflow from sample collection to the delivery of the result? \u2022 In 2013, Safavieh and Juncker introduced the term of Capillarics, a preprogrammed, self-powered microfluidic circuit built from capillary elements where liquid handling is encoded in the structure and chemistry of the conduits [157] . \"What if\" paper-based devices could be similarly self-powered through careful design of their materials? \u2022 \"What if\" paper-based devices, thanks to their low-cost technology and production, could permit the development of a more accessible type of personalized medicine?",

            "text": "Looking back over the contents of the book we are struck by the pace, scale, and diversity of ongoing work, as well as the realization that the field of POC diagnostics has grown beyond a scope that can be mastered by any one technique or investigator. This of course is exciting, but also daunting, for researchers as they seek to advance the field. The ASSURED criteria will provide ongoing guidance to the development of relevant tools, but of course it is important to recognize that each design feature should be considered in the context of the intended POC environment. In other words, the intended application of an ideal diagnostic device must be considered from the outset of design. When cost is not the main limiting factor to deployment, ultrarapid, self-contained disposable cassettes may be ideal. However in well-established but poor urban environments, other factors such as time or convenience may be less of a constraint on design in favor of being able to provide clinical-grade results. There may even be a future for applications where even sensitivity or specificity can be sacrificed in favor of strategies in which multiplexed detection and low cost provide redundancy for diagnosis of complex disease (e.g., paper-based gene expression profiling; [158] ). The key is that without a final set of applications and target population in mind, the complete design space available to build practical portable diagnostics may not be recognized ( Fig. 6.1) . Similarly, as developers of POC diagnostics we must also be held to account on implementation, including a workflow from sample through to answer. Steps toward implementation must follow technology development; otherwise our efforts become only an academic exercise, which must not happen. Unfortunately, the literature is replete with reports of incremental advances that have not been demonstrated with real samples and/or under real-field conditions. While the reasons for this are complex, future leaders in the field, and those who will see their designs catch the attention of the funders, will be the ones who take the time (and risk) to push the limits of their technology and iterate until their design criteria are met. This may require a series of studies and vertical integration of our laboratory efforts, but the responsibility is on us to demonstrate the value of our work at point of care.",

The successful design and implementation of paper-based diagnostics require a holistic view that considers the goals of the test, the limitations in the intended environment for its use, and the context of the sample from which it will be expected to perform. This technical design and development must also be paired with partnerships at the community level and, ultimately, tested under field conditions to watch are the following. (1) Sample preparation technologies that are portable and cost effective are perhaps the most critical to the success of our field as well as the compatibility of the preparation, extraction, and analysis steps. It is this capability that will convert innovative assays into field-ready tools. Here we see digital/microfluidics as key to implementing low-cost and automated workflows that can be used by nonexperts under field conditions. (2) Nucleic acid amplification and other molecular technologies will be an increasing source of capability for POC diagnostics as researchers incorporate new techniques and enzymes, as well as methods for deployment without refrigeration. (3) Materials engineering and nanotechnologies will also provide exciting and increasingly cost-effective ways of moving laboratory assays to the field.",
