Signal detection/raw data analysis Signals were detected with the Luminex 200 IS System using QIAplex MDD Software. In-house determination of the cut-off value that could be applied to distinguish positive results was required since software lacks this interpretive criterion. Four different cut-off values were studied including 3\u00d7 background (bkgd), \u226550, \u2265100, or \u2265150 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values. For 3\u00d7 background calculation, the negative control MFI for each assay was multiplied by three and used as the cutoff to define positive samples within that run. To decide which cut-off value was most appropriate, the results obtained with each cutoff were compared to RVS/MS, discrepant analysis with alternate PCR assays, and conventional test results. Two cutoffs, \u2265100 MFI and 3\u00d7 bkgd MFI, showed the best correlation with aggregate data from other test methods. The 3\u00d7 bkgd cut-off was selected because it demonstrated excellent overall agreement with the other methods and it allowed inter-run data normalization by accounting for run-to-run variability in background fluorescence. For the purposes of this study, RSV A and B were not differentiated and bocavirus was not included in the analysis since its importance as a respiratory pathogen has not been firmly established.",

Positive and negative agreement (by virus and by total positives and negatives) were calculated using RPII as the test assay and RVS/MS as the comparator assay. Since this agreement analysis highlights deficiencies in virus detection by RPII but minimized detection deficiencies by RVS/MS, an assessment of sensitivity and specificity of each assay was also performed using the following definitions: true positive, positive by two NATs (either RPII plus RVS/MS or one multiplex tests plus one NAT used for discordant analysis) or one multiplex NAT (RPII or RVS/MS) and one conventional test; true negative, negative by RPII and RVS/MS; false positive, positive by one multiplex NAT (RPII or RVS/MS) but negative by the other multiplex NAT, by alternate NAT and by conventional tests. Due to the small number of INF B (2), INF A and B were combined as INF for agreement, sensitivity, and specificity calculations. Likewise, PIVs were analyzed as a single group (PIV) since the combined total number of PIV 1, 3 and 4 detected was four. CoVs were analyzed as a group since there is currently no clinical utility to distinguishing these viruses individually. EV and HRV discordant results were not adjudicated by a third assay, therefore, only agreement was determined. Confidence intervals were calculated using a web-based calculator.8 Positive signal statistical data provided in Supplemental data tables were calculated using Excel.",

Deep multiplexing also has the important advantage of allowing identification of not only the usual pathogens (RSV, INF A, ADVs) but also unsuspected, typically lower virulence viruses (PIVs, HRVs, CoVs) that can cause lower respiratory tract disease and can therefore be significantly pathogenic in highly susceptible hosts. In this performance comparison study on samples from hospitalized children, the highly multiplexed RPII and RVS/MS assays detected most viruses with fairly equivalent accuracy. The exceptions to this were hMPV and ADV which were more effectively detected by RPII and RVS/MS respectively. A low ADV detection rate by RPII compared to a different extensively multiplexed respiratory virus NAT (Seeplex) has been previously reported.9 Independent published confirmation of low hMPV detection rates by RVS/MS compared to an alternate NAT are lacking. Given that ADV and hMPV are highly prevalent and can cause serious disease, these potential diagnostic shortcomings are significant and represent opportunities for performance enhancement in subsequent generations of these assays. Unfortunately the prevalence of PIVs was too low to make any definitive conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of RPII and RVS/MS. It should also be noted that the study design precludes conclusions regarding true (vs. relative) accuracy and sensitivity. Therefore, while the accuracy of detection for most viruses was comparable and quite high, testing with gold standard NATs for each analyte might reveal additional detection deficiencies common to RPII and RVS/MS.",

RPII provides better diagnostic potential than the current version of RVS/MS since it can detect EV/HRV. In fact, in this study, the prevalence of EV/HRV was highest of all viruses (\u223c37%, including RPII and RT-PCR positives). However, RPII has limitations with regard to EV/HRV detection. First, the data suggest cross-reactivity between RPII EV and HRV detection reagents as suggested by previous studies that noted discordant EV/HRV results in a limited number of samples10 and a high proportion of EV/HRV dual positives.9 Our data imply that cross-reactivity is more extensive than previously appreciated given the number of discordant (RPII EV+/RT-PCR HRV+) and RPII dual+/RT-PCR HRV only specimens.",

The low mean and median HRV RT-PCR Ct values suggest that most of these samples likely contained HRV only, further implying issues with EV detection specificity (by RPII and RT-PCR) and sensitivity of HRV detection (by RPII). Published data6 and our unpublished observations with the EV RT-PCR reagents suggest a propensity for cross-reactivity. An internal study of EV and HRV RT-PCR reagents demonstrated HRV in 69/507 NPAs; 4/69 were also amplified by EV RT-PCR. VP1 sequence data was obtainable from 1/4 samples and demonstrated HRV. HRV RT-PCR specificity should be much greater than EV RT-PCR; the latter was developed by comparative analysis of a more extensive sequence library compared to EV RT-PCR and was shown to cross-amplify EV only in artificial samples spiked with high concentrations of synthetic transcripts.7\n",
