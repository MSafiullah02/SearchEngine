In this study we established a mouse monoclonal antibody, 493D4, that recognizes 9-O-acetyl GT3 ganglioside, but not non-O-acetyl gangliosides. This antibody also reacted with 9-O-acetyl GD3 to a much lesser extent. By using this antibody, we found that O-acetyl GT3 as well as O-acetyl GD3 were expressed strongly in fetal murine cerebral cortex and decreased to an undetectable level after birth. With the assistance of TLC-immunostaining using 493D4 together with Q-Sepharose column chromatography, O-acetyl gangliosides of bovine brain were purified and the structural analysis showed the presence of O-acetyl GD3, O-acetyl LD1, O-acetyl GD2 and O-acetyl GD1b in the adult brain as extremely minor components. Interestingly, the antibody 493D4 could detect O-acetyl sialoglycoproteins in rat brain tissues. One of the major immunoreactive proteins was shown to be synaptophysin, an integral membrane protein specifically present in synaptic vesicles. This monoclonal antibody was therefore useful for sensitive detection of both O-acetylated gangliosides and glycoproteins with O-acetylated sialic acids.",

            "text": "Sialic acid is an acidic sugar constituent in most glycoconjugates including gangliosides and glycoproteins. In addition to acetylation or glycolylation of the amino group, sialic acid is also found to be modified by O-acetylation at the 4, 7, 8 and 9 positions. Some biological properties of these sugars seem to be associated with these modifications, eg they prevent hydrolysis by sialidases [2, 3] , they serve as receptors of influenza C viruses and coronaviruses [4, 5] , as antigens of bacterial capsules [6] and as a differentiation marker on chicken erythrocytes [7] , and they modulate complement activation through the alternative pathway [8] . The expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides was associated with cell migration in rat brain development [9] , and the expression of an O-acetylated ganglioside 9-O-Ac-GD3 in human melanoma cells served as a tumourassociated antigen [10] . The mAb 27A against O-Ac-GD3 induced mitogenic response in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells [11] , whereas the mAb 8A2 against O-Ac-gangliosides caused retraction of goldfish retinal ganglion cell axons [12, 13] . Varki et al. [14] destroyed the 9-O-acetylated from of sialic acids in mouse embryos by expressing influenza C virus 9-O-acetyl esterase. An early expression of the esterase arrested the development at the two-cell stage. The selective expression of the esterase during late embryogenesis caused abnormalities only in the retina and adrenal gland. Based on these results, it is postulated that the modification of sialic acid residues with acetate may play roles in a wide range of biological processes.",

Several monoclonal antibodies have been reported recognizing specifically gangliosides containing O-acetyl sialic acid residues [15] [16] [17] [18] . The detection of gangliosides with O-acetyl sialic acids is significantly improved by TLC-immunostaining with these antibodies. However, these mAbs selectively recognize only a few gangliosides containing O-acetyl sialic acid. To discover all the O-Ac-gangliosides, the establishment of new mAbs with different specificity is required. Recently, an effort has also been made to produce a chimeric probe by fusion of the IgG Fc portion with the O-acetyl sialic acid binding domain of influenza C virus haemagglutinin [19] .",

In fetal rat cerebral cortex, GT3 ganglioside antigen could be exposed to mAb M6704 by base treatment [18] . Our data suggested that the antigen may be masked by O-acetylation of the sialic acid residues of GT3. The antigen was highly enriched at gestation day 14, and decreased afterwards. In this study, we established a new mAb (493D4) that can directly bind to O-acetylated sialic acid epitopes without the requirement of base pretreatment. TLC-immunostaining of gangliosides from murine embryonic cerebral cortex with mAb 493D4 showed that not only the expression of O-Ac-GT3 but also that of O-Ac-GD3 was regulated in a development consistent with the observation made by Chou et al. [17] . This antibody was found to recognize a wide range of O-Acgangliosides that did not react or reacted only weakly with several other antibodies known to recognize O-Acgangliosides. With the aid of this antibody, the structures of several O-Ac-gangliosides of adult bovine brain were identified.",

In this study, we demonstrated that mAb 493D4 directly recognizes the parent molecule, O-Ac-GT3, with no need of modification by base treatment. The mAb 493D4 does not cross-react with non-O-Ac-gangliosides including GT3. By TLC-immunostaining of gangliosides of murine cerebral cortex at gestation days 14-21 and postnatal days 1-10, mAb 493D4 detected several antigens ( Figure 1A ). One of them comigrated with 9-O-AcGT3 and another one, 9-O-Ac-GD3. Structure analysis indicates that these two gangliosides are identical to O-Ac-GT3 and O-Ac-GD3 as reported by Ren et al. [35] . The expression of O-Ac-GT3 and O-Ac-GD3 appears to be developmentally regulated in murine cerebral cortex ( Figure  1B) . O-Ac-GT3 was highly expressed at gestation days 14-16 and thereafter the amount of O-Ac-GT3 gradually decreased. O-Ac-GT3 levels were very low after birth and in the adult. The expression of O-Ac-GD3 reached a maximum at gestation days 16-17 and disappeared a few days after birth. Isolation and characterization of mAb 493D4-reactive gangliosides of bovine brain",

Total ganglioside extract from the bovine brain was separated by preparative Q-Sepharose chromatography (Figure 2A ), which has been used to purify several minor gangliosides of bovine brain [36, 37] . After fractionation of gangliosides by Q-sepharose chromatography, the amount of each ganglioside applied on a TLC plate could be greatly increased and therefore the efficiency of TLCimmunostaining for detection of minor gangliosides was significantly enhanced. More than 20 components could be detected by TLC-immunostaining with mAb 493D4 in the separated ganglioside fractions of bovine brain ( Figure 2B ). The mAb P-path known to recognize O-Ac-ganglioside, reacted mainly with O-Ac-disialogangliosides ( Figure 2C ), while mAb 493D4 recognized not only O-Ac-disialogangliosides but also O-Ac-gangliosides in trisialo-and polysialoganglioside fractions ( Figure 2B ). In disialoganglioside fractions (fractions 4-8, Figure 2A and B), we detected four main antigens. One antigen comigrated with O-Ac-GD3 (in lane 4). The three other major positive components, designated as X1, X2 and X3, were further purified by HPLC equipped with a column of Senshu Pak AQUASIL SS-625N and finally preparative TLC. The purified antigens X1 and X2 had a similar mobility and migrated between GD1a and GM1, while X3 moved between GD1a and GD1b when HPTLC plate was developed with solvent A, a neutral developing solvent ( Figure 3A ). When the plate was developed with solvent B, an alkaline developing solvent, the mobilities of GM1 and GD1b were significantly reduced while the mobilities of X1 and X2 were not changed and therefore they migrated faster than GM1 ( Figure 3B ). In contrast, the mobility of X3 was significantly reduced to an extent comparable to GD1b. The mobility of O-Ac-GT3 was changed in a different manner from that of X1, X2 or X3 ( Figure 3A and B), indicating that none of X1, X2, or X3 was O-Ac-GT3. The yields of X1, X2, and X3 were approximately 1.4 mg, 0.94 mg and 1.2 mg from 12 g of total bovine brain ganglioside fraction.",

In cryocut sections of the cerebellum stained with mAb P-path, the immunoreactivity was associated exclusively with the Purkinje cell dendrites at the molecular layer and their cell bodies (Figure. 9A ). The labelling appeared as a punctuated pattern associated with the membranes of dendrites and cell bodies except for nuclei. Similar but more sparse staining patterns for P-path antigens were observed in the mouse cerebellum [16] . By contrast, the immunoreactivity of mAb 493D4 was detected on both parallel fibres in the molecular layer and cerebellar glomeruli in the granule cell layer ( Figure 9B ). Cerebellar Purkinje cells an interneurons in the molecular layer were not stained by this mAb. These staining profiles were quite similar to those of rabphilin-3A and rab 3A, synaptic vesicle associated proteins [38] , and coincided with the fact that mAb 493 recognized synaptophysin on immunoblot as demonstrated above. Moreover, treatment of cerebellar tissues with a chloroform/methanol mixture did not cause significant changes in immunorectivity of mAb 493D4 with the tissues, indicating that the antibody reacted exclusively with synaptophysin but not O-Ac-gangliosides (data not shown). The present immunohistochemical analyses defined differential distributions of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans reactive with mAb P-path or 493D4 in the central nervous system.",

It is noteworthy that some minor gangliosides are expressed in a cell type specific and developmentally regulated manner [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . For example, Chol-1 gangliosides are localized on cholinergic neurons [41] [42] [43] . We have observed that 14 day fetal rat cerebral cortex highly expresses an antigen that may be GT3 ganglioside containing O-acetyl sialic acid [18] . To directly detect the presence of this antigen in tissue a mAb 493D4 was established which has high affinity to 9-O-Ac-GT3. This mAb can also recognize a number of other gangliosides containing O-acetyl sialic acid, but not those major and regular gangliosides containing non-O-acetyl sialic acid. Among documented antibodies, mAb JONES [44] and mAb 27A are specific for 9-O-Ac-GD3 [45] . D1.1 [15] (data not shown) and P-path [16] mAbs recognize mainly 9-O-Ac-gangliosides in the disialoganglioside fractions of Q-Sepharose chromatography.

The O-acetyl ester of O-Ac-GT3 is also located on the terminal 2-8-linked sialic acid rather than the internal 2-8-linked trisialyl residue [18, 35] . Thus it is suggested that O-acetyl transferase(s) may O-acetylate the terminal 2-8-linked sialic acid of the tandem disialyl and trisialyl residue.",

In rat and mouse, O-Ac-GDE and O-Ac-GT3 were highly expressed in fetal cerebral cortex, but decreased significantly after birth to a low level in the adult [16, 27, Figure 1 ]. In adult bovine brain, O-Ac-GD3 and O-Ac-GT3 could be detected only after enrichment by purification procedures. The mAb JONES, which was more specific to O-Ac-GD3, showed a striking dorsal-ventral gradient of expression across the developing retina [44, 49, 50] . The transient expression of O-Ac-GD3 was also observed in the development of other organs, for example, rat kidney [45, 51] . In the adult, C-series O-Ac-gangliosides are only expressed in the restricted tissues or cell types, for example, the podocytes of the glomeruli of the rat kidney [51] and bovine milk products [52] . However, the O-Ac-GD3 is expressed in a considerable amount in human melanomas [15, 53, 54] . O-Ac-GD3 may have a significance in the immunotherapy of human melanoma [55] .",

The synaptophysin has been reported to be a 38 kDa protein with N-glycosylation [56] . However, the physiological function of synaptophysin is as yet unclear [57] . The reactivity of synaptophysin with mAb 493D4 and its sensitivity to alkaline treatment and sialidase hydrolysis indicates that synaptophysin may contain O-Ac-sialic acid. Treatment of glycoproteins with endoglycoceramidase did not destroy the reactivity of the glycoprotein with mAb 493D4 (data not shown), suggesting that the determinant on the glycoprotein is not an associated O-Ac-gangliosides but synaptophysin itself. These results show that this monoclonal antibody is quite useful for sensitive detection of both O-acetylated gangliosides and glycoproteins with O-acetylated sialic acids.",
