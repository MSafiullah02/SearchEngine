Our selection of topics and authors was biased toward emerging areas, such as the application of systems biology approaches to viral pathogenesis and immunity, the contribution of inflammatory and stress responses to the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses, and the impact of the microbiome on immunity to virus infection. We also considered it relevant to include reviews focused on well\u2010defined areas where recent findings have resulted in potential paradigm shifts in our understanding of topics such as B\u2010lymphocyte or T\u2010lymphocyte responses to virus infection. This volume of Immunological Reviews is also somewhat weighted toward analyses of the immune response to respiratory viruses. With the recent episodic infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010like coronavirus and the outbreak of human infections with the avian influenza A H7N9 virus, respiratory viruses such as these organisms are recognized as major human pathogens with the potential for pandemic spread.

NLRs are a large receptor family including at least 20 members. NLRs play a dominant role in inflammasome activation resulting in the Caspase\u20101\u2010dependent maturation and release from cells of the pro\u2010inflammatory mediators interleukin\u20101 (IL\u20101) and IL\u201018. However, not all NLRs are pro\u2010inflammatory. Engagement of certain members of this receptor family can downregulate pro\u2010inflammatory signals generated by other PRR types 11. In addition, several NLRs have been reported to regulate antigen presentation events associated with the MHC class I and II presentation pathways 12, 13.

Type I IFNs were initially identified and named based on their antiviral properties. However, in addition to upregulating genes that inhibit virus replication, this class of cytokines has been appreciated to play an important role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response to virus infection. Recently, a new family of antiviral cytokines, the type III IFN family, has been identified. The type III IFNs (also known as IFN \u03bb 1, 2, 3 or IL\u201029, IL\u201028A, IL\u201028B, respectively) appeared to activate the same antiviral pathways and transcriptional factors, e.g. IFN\u2010stimulated gene factor 3, as the type I IFNs. However, the type III IFNs have little structural homology with their type I counterparts and engage a distinct heterodimeric receptor, which includes the IL\u201010R2 chain 15. In their article, Durbin and coworkers 16 summarize the current understanding of antiviral signaling by type I and type III IFNs, with particular emphasis on the induction of these cytokines and the expression of antiviral activity of these two cytokine families at mucosal surfaces, notably the respiratory tract and gut following infection with influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus, or rotavirus. They also summarize our current understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of these cytokines on the induction of the adaptive immune response through their effect on specific cell types, for example natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) 17, and the distinct signal transduction events associated with immune modulation by IFN.",

In their review on the impact of autophagy on CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010mediated antiviral immunity, Perot and colleagues 20 review the complex interplay between viruses and three pathways of response to virus infection, that is autophagy, the innate immune response, and the adaptive immune response. In this article, the authors describe the subcellular constituents making up the autophagy response and strategies that viruses employ to either enhance or inhibit autophagy and the consequences of alterations in autophagy on innate and adaptive immune response induction. Of particular note is the recent evidence on the contribution of autophagy to viral antigen processing and presentation to CD8+ T cells.

This report examines the consequences of direct activation of DCs by virus infection as well as indirect or trans activation of DCs by products released by airway epithelial cells, themselves responding to engagement of their PRRs by virus or cellular stress. For example, IL\u20101 produced by respiratory epithelial cells following PRR engagement acts in an autocrine fashion to release DC\u2010attracting chemokines as well as granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor to support DC recruitment and viability and factors involved in epithelial regeneration (IL\u201033). DC migration from the lungs to the draining lymph nodes is an essential step in the initiation of the antiviral T\u2010cell response. Type I IFNs are the most potent inducers of DC maturation resulting in DC migration 22. This report also reviews current findings on the role of individual DC subsets in orchestrating different aspects of the adaptive immune response, including the dominant role of the CD8a/CD 103+ DC family in cross\u2010presenting viral pathogen to naive CD8+ T cells and the role of C\u2010type lectins (most notably DNGR\u20101) in capturing viral antigen delivered by dying epithelial cells 23.

Approximately 150\u2013200 million people worldwide are estimated to have chronic HCV infection. HCV persists in up to 80% of infected individuals with only a minority of individuals clearing infection without therapeutic intervention. The ability of this virus to persist in such a large fraction of infected individuals suggests that it is capable of dysregulating the host innate and adaptive immune response to allow its persistence in the liver. Although modified IFN\u2010based regimens have been the standard of treatment for HCV for more than a decade, success rates vary substantially depending on the genotype of HCV infecting the patient.

Polyreactive natural antibodies are largely of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) class and are generated independent of antigen challenge 29 by a distinct class of B lymphocytes, B\u20101 (CD5+ B\u20101a, and CD5\u2010B\u20101b) B cells. The immunoglobulin receptor on B\u20101 cells is diverse but does not normally undergo Ig class switch.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that they can bind pathogen\u2010associated antigens.

In their review, Goh et al. 44 discuss the mechanisms involved in the generation and accumulation and survival of MDSCs during virus infection and the critical targets of MDSC action including T cells, NK cells, and antigen\u2010presenting cells. They go on to catalog the list of viral infections in which the activity of MDSCs has been reported and then explore MDSCs as targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of chronic virus infections.",

While this topic has been the subject of recent reviews in Immunological Reviews, Wilks and colleagues 45 focus their article on the impact of commensal bacteria on the host response to virus infection, as exemplified by the impact of all antibiotic treatments on IAV pathogenesis and the host adaptive response to the virus 46, 47. We are still in the early days in our understanding of the role of commensal microorganisms in controlling innate and adaptive immune responses to viruses, but as indicated elsewhere in this volume 33, data are emerging to suggest both subtle and potentially profound effects of microflora on the antiviral immune response and outcome of virus infection.",

He discusses vaccination strategies in the context of augmenting cytolytic neutralizing antibodies and/or CD8+ T\u2010cell responses and the necessity and feasibility of vaccination leading to sterilizing immunity. He goes on to describe the impact of new technologies, notably high throughput sequencing and the application of structural biology approaches to antigen design on vaccine development.

Data obtained from this molecular profiling can be used to formulate hypotheses for traditional research analyses. It can also be used in an iterative fashion to expand or narrow the data acquisition platform. In their report, Pulendran and coauthors 49 discuss the systems approach to the analysis of human vaccination against yellow fever virus and IAV with the ultimate aim of establishing the molecular profile of a successful immune response to vaccination. Studies such as these have begun to reunite the fields of vaccinology and basic immunology. The systems approach to vaccination evaluation has begun to identify the importance of stress sensors in establishing an effective vaccination strategy and in the future may provide a molecular signature of a successful response to vaccination as well as the parameters that could be associated with an adverse reaction to vaccine.",
