Although this feature can be useful in controlling a small classroom or meeting, for a bigger classroom or meeting (where hundreds of participant can join), this feature can also fail. It could be near impossible for the teacher or the meeting host for remembering hundreds of names and online identities of students and meeting participants. This solution also can create a lot of hassle as some of the joining requests can be attended in-themiddle of the Zoom session. Besides the wait room feature, other guidelines, such as not to share the meeting links in public domain, sharing the meeting links just before the start of the meeting and not using recurring meeting options, and controlling the screen share option etc. can be used. None of them, however, can provide full-proof defense against a savvy attacker (e.g., a hacker).",

The PRNU-based authentication can seamlessly authenticate a meeting participant (or a student) by authenticating the camera of the device she uses in the meeting (or online classroom). In such cases, the meeting participant enjoys the same usability that she enjoys with default zoom setup (no password to remember, no keys to press, no bio-metric required). Whenever the PRNU-based scheme cannot authenticate, the participant is asked to enter the password. The proposed scheme was experimentally validated by validating the effectiveness of the PRNU-based method for the webcams of desktops, and selfie-camera of mobile phones and tablets (as these cameras are typically used in Zoom sessions). The experiment with a set of 10 cameras shows promising result.",

By default, Zoom does not authenticate a participant. This leads to a number of security and privacy issues, such as authentication issue. Figure 1 shows how authentication threat can happen for a Zoom meeting with default meeting setup. It is assumed that the Attacker can know the meeting ID. This is a safe assumption as people are sharing meeting IDs in public forum (e.g., social media). It is also assumed that the host and legitimate participants will not often detect that the Attacker has joined. This is also a safe assumption as the attacker can join in-between the meeting when the host and participants are busy.

Figure 2 shows how this method works. PRNU-based camera attribution is based on the fact that the output of the camera sensor, I, can be modeled as where I (0) is the noise-free video frame (or an image), K is the PRNU noise, and \u03c8 is the combination of additional noise, such as readout noise, dark current, and quantization noise. The multiplicative PRNU noise pattern, K, is unique for each camera and can be used as a camera fingerprint which enables the attribution of a video to its source camera. Using a denoising filter F (such as a Wavelet filter) on a set of video frames of a camera (where it is known that the video belongs to the camera, physical access to the camera is not required), we can estimate a known camera fingerprint by first getting the noise residual, W k , (i.e., the estimated PRNU) of the k th frame as",

In this step, each legitimate participant of a Zoom meeting must register the fingerprint of her camera with the meeting host. This step is done only once before the start of a meeting. For recurring meetings, registration is also required once before the start of the meeting series. This step can be implemented in a number of ways. A possible way that is more suitable for recurring meetings is to integrate the registration step in a customized Zoom installation app. The host will send the installation app to each participants. During the time of installation, a short video (say, one minute) will be automatically taken (after taking participant's permission) using the camera of the device that is installing the App. Then a camera fingerprint from the video will be computed using the method described in Section 2. The computed fingerprint (e.g., Fingerprint 1.N by Participant N in Figure 3 ) will be sent to the host. This way of implementing can perfectly suit online teaching setup, where the students can be asked by the educational institute to install a customized Zoom app. Another possible way of implementation is to ask the participants for sending a short video from their camera using a secure communication method (such as secure email). The host can then compute the camera fingerprint of each participant. Figure 4 provides an overview of the fingerprint matching step. In this step, the authenticity of each participant is checked. This step is performed each time a participant wants to join a Zoom meeting. From initial few seconds of the participant's video, a camera fingerprint is computed. The camera fingerprint (e.g., Fingerprint 2.N for Participant N in Figure 4) is then sent to the host. Note that for computing the fingerprint and sending it to the host, no assistance from the participant is required. For each participant, the host matches the registered fingerprint with recently obtained fingerprint (for ex- . If the match result is above a threshold, the participant is authenticated, and her Zoom joining request is approved. Otherwise, the user is asked to enter a password that was setup by the meeting host. The current version of Zoom allows the meeting host to setup a password. This password needs to be sent to the participants using other communication methods (such as email or phone). The proposed method is experimentally validated by assessing the performance of the PRNU-based method for short videos taken by front cameras of various computing devices (PC, laptop, mobile, tab). In this small scale-experiment, the goal is to study the feasibility of the proposed method.",

This short video is used as for providing a smaller delay (due to PRNU matching) for meeting requests. The PRNU matching is done using PCE with a threshold of 60. Figure 5 shows the performance of the proposed method. Out of 10 matching, 10 matching were successful (as the obtained PCE is larger than the threshold 60) by giving a true positive rate of 100% for this small scale experiment. The achieved true positive rate is by no means generalisable. A large scale experiment is required to find the error rates. However, this small scale experiment shows that the proposed approach works. Table 1 show the computation cost in computing the query fingerprint and performing matching (Verify time) from 100 frames. This cost is the main contributor to the run-time delay that a user needs to bear due to authentication. This table also reports the computation cost required in the registration phase. This cost, however, is one-time offline cost. Note that, for a smaller video, all the computation costs will be lesser; and for a larger video, these costs will be higher. This trade-off is due to the fact that a lesser number of frames will require lesser number of denoising (which is the main contributor to the delay).",

One of the main security issue is the poor authentication mechanism, due to which an unauthorized person is able to join a meeting and create disturbances leading to Zoom bombing and Zoom eavesdropping. In this paper, we have proposed our preliminary work towards a seamless authentication scheme. The proposed scheme uses PRNU-based camera authentication method to authenticate a meeting participants. Those who are not authenticated using this method need to provide a password. A small scale experiment shows that the proposed method works as expected. However, a number of improvements need to be done for making the method usable. We have provided some of the possible improvements below.",

Protection against attacks: There can be a number of attacks. For example, if an attacker collects a video of a legitimate participant from another source (e.g., social media), she can impersonate the participant. Techniques need to be developed for withstanding such attacks. Developing an app: An app implementing the proposed idea needs to be developed. A large scale user study needs to be conducted by asking users (both computer experts and non-computer users) to use the app. This study will provide a better evaluation of the proposed idea in terms of performance, usability, and security.",
