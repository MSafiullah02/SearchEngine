Two-sided tests with P < 05 were considered significant, with the exception of data on the frequency of common colds and PCR-positive colds (P < .025, because this outcome was assessed by two similar methods). The rate difference between the groups for colds was compared using a Poisson regression model adjusted for BMI, atopy, and parity, with a robust option when data were overdispersed. Secondary outcomes were cold severity (analyzed as panel data using Stata's xtreg with random effects and adjusted for baseline CCQ score, BMI, atopy, and parity), impact of colds on asthma, and impact of colds on pregnancy outcomes. We assessed the relationship between PCR-positive colds in asthma and preeclampsia/pregnancy-induced hypertension with logistic regression, adjusting for smoking, parity, age, BMI, and multiple pregnancy. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses were used to evaluate different diagnostic cutoff levels for the CCQ score in PCR positive infections (e-Fig 3).

In a large prospective study, 14.4% of women had a common cold during pregnancy, with one-half of these colds medically recorded.16 The CCQ we used identified more common colds than self-report, and not all of these were virus-positive by laboratory testing. The prospective nature of our study likely contributed to a high rate of reporting of common colds. It is possible that confounding by symptoms of rhinitis may have contributed to a high proportion of women with questionnaire-detected colds.",

The CCQ is an unvalidated tool, which limits the conclusions we can make using this instrument, particularly since the CCQ is not validated to distinguish between viral infections and rhinitis. There was the possibility of recall bias for colds assessed retrospectively, although for the majority of pregnancy we collected data prospectively. The pregnant women with asthma had higher parity than pregnant women without asthma, which might increase their exposure to virus infections from other children.26, 27 However, we adjusted for this as well as other confounders, such as atopy and BMI (a known risk factor for exacerbations in pregnancy28), when considering the rate of colds. Our sample collection time was not ideal, with swabs collected within a median of 3 to 4 days from symptom worsening. We contacted women fortnightly by phone and sent mobile phone text reminders every other week to try to increase participation and offered home visits during colds. The CCQ covers only 2 days of the past 14, and since we did not administer it daily, it is possible colds were missed. The number of PCR-positive colds experienced by women with asthma, when adjusted for follow-up time, was not significantly different from the control group. This may be due to a lack of power, since only a proportion of common colds were tested in the laboratory, or rhinitis-like symptoms and cough may be amplified by asthma or pregnancy themselves, resulting in more colds being detected that were not true infections. Although we found second trimester colds to be more frequent than third trimester colds, it is possible that rhinitis of pregnancy may have contributed to this finding.",
