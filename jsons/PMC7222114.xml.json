Therefore, these findings cannot be extrapolated to extremely preterm infants during the critical period shortly after extubation. Furthermore, analysis of breathing PATTs was performed manually and in a selected number of breaths. Indeed, clinical evidence of HFNC safety and efficacy in this population is lacking, as a small number of extremely preterm infants were included in randomized trials comparing NCPAP and HFNC after extubation.6,11 Thus, a better understanding of the physiological effects of these modes of support following extubation is necessary in this population.",

In a crossover study, Saslow et al.7 evaluated lung mechanics in 18 infants using RIP signals analysis. No differences in WOB were noted between NCPAP and HFNC. More recently, De Jongh et al. studied 20 infants extubated for \u226548 h and on non-invasive respiratory support.16 Using a crossover random design, WOB indices were evaluated from uncalibrated RIP signal recordings of 2 to 4 min during four different modes: NCPAP at 5 and 6cmH2O and HFNC at flow rates of 3 and 5 lpm. Although statistically significant differences on WOB indices were noted between NCPAP and HFNC, they were not clinically meaningful, as suggested by the large overlap of the 95% confidence intervals. Differently from our study, infants were more mature and with higher weights at the time of recordings. Furthermore, analysis of the RIP signals was done in a selected number of breaths (over a shorter time frame) and did not provide information on respiratory pauses. In the present study, by using an automated and objective method, we were able to analyze all breaths. In another trial, Campbell et al.17 studied 40 preterm infants with GA of 27.5 weeks extubated around the second day of life to either NCPAP or HFNC. APN was defined based on nurses\u2019 notes as a pause in breathing for >20 s and BDY as HR <80 bpm for >10 s, over a period of 7 days of treatment. Extubation failure was significantly higher in the HFNC group (60% vs. 15%, p = 0.003) and all infants were reintubated due to severe APN or increased frequency of APNs. The duration of the APN events was not reported. Due to the study protocol, we included a relatively more stable population, as 90% of the infants were successfully extubated. This selection bias could be the reason for the lack of differences in SYB and ASB breaths (WOB) or MVT (agitation and/or distortion) between the modes. Nevertheless, longer respiratory pauses were noted during HFNC therapy. Although small, such differences in respiratory pauses in combination with higher FiO2 requirements may reflect some instability of the cardiorespiratory system during HFNC therapy after only 45 min of exposure and 30 min of analysis. As APNs and increased FiO2 are the most common causes of extubation failure,18 our findings raise concerns about the widespread use of HFNC therapy in this immature population as a mode of post-extubation support.",
