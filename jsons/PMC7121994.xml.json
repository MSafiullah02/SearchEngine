The former is a method of computationally representing individual interactions from which social patterns emerge; the latter is a method that affords (dynamic) structural analysis of (socio-) structural patterns. The renowned anthropologist Clyde Mitchell stated that the starting point of any analysis should be the actual relationships in which people are involved (Mitchell 1989, pp. 77\u201379). What he did not think of, interestingly, is to analyze, other than by observational and descriptive means, how these relationships form.",

They consist of autonomous agents that can be perceived as computer programs themselves. In principal, agents have three features: they behave and interact according to a given set of rules, possess cognitive capabilities to process information, and constitute their own environment (cf. Cederman 2001; Ferber 1999). Empirically seen, the key question is how the design of agent behavior and cognition is informed. Standard research practices suggest that the agent design process can rely on qualitative data (Alam et al. 2010; Hoffer 2006), experimental data (Barreteau et al.\n2001), and empirically validated theoretical knowledge (Cioffi-Revilla and Osman 2009).",

The importance of this statement lies in the fact that agent interactions as defined by agent behavior are tantamount to what is called in social network analysis \u2018re-wiring\u2019, i.e., according to which rules (algorithms) do the different nodes in a network get connected with each other. ABMs claiming to have relevance for the social sciences should assume plausible behavior at the individual level. ABMs are considered non-black-box models (Boudon 1998). Should ABMs serve as social network generators, then one requirement is that they can explain how the network came about. Hence, from an epistemological perspective, the model needs to exhibit construct-valid mechanisms and processes.",

Networks generated by ABMs can represent social, geographical, and even cognitive (semantic network) spaces. In their capacity as thematic maps, networks can be used to elucidate such concepts as exchange, power, or identity. Paired with social simulation, these questions can be further explored insofar as agent-based modeling enables the study of the underlying agent behavior, and social mechanisms and processes (Hedstr\u00f6m 2005).

This is true for abstract spaces as well as for detailed Geographic Information Systems (GIS) referenced spaces. Perhaps the most commonly used topologies in agent-based modeling are the von Neumann or Moore neighborhoods on a plain or a toroid surface. Other possible topologies are, for example, irregular, hexagonal grids or vector-based (Crooks et al. 2008). Differences in topologies lead to differences in network generation processes and resulting network structures (c.f. Flache and Hegselmann 2001). The reason for this is that model topologies limit agents not only in their movement, but also in the manner by which they perceive information and interact with other agents. The underlying assumption is that space is important and matters in everyday (artificial) life, affecting both the individual\u2019s behavior and society as a whole. Choice of a topology depends very much on the modeler\u2019s needs. The focus of the discussion here is on the effect that different model topologies have on network evolution processes and network structures. In other words, how are dynamic social networks coupled to model space? Note that this question is distinct from questions of how space is represented in networks, which we discuss below.",

Schensul et al. (1999) have thoroughly covered the issues involving spatial mapping of data; we report a few of the most relevant points. For any social networks, the atomic units are usually the individuals. In gathering data about individuals, it is quite useful to identify the general spatio-temporal constraints that limit most individuals\u2019 movements and interaction in the region. Typically, in spatially explicit models, agents may include stakeholders, land owners, farmers, public institutions, and policy or decision-making agencies.

It has become more and more accepted in the social sciences that the agents\u2019 (e.g., humans, primates, ants) behavior does not follow a linear pattern, but is non-linear in its own right. Social complexity, according to Moss (2008, p. 2), is a \u201ccondition whereby social behavior cannot be understood simply as a scaled-up replication of the behavior of the individuals comprising the society\u201d. The interplay of social processes as an outcome of socially embedded individuals gives rise to the social behavior, which, as Moss (2008, p. 3) explains, \u201ccannot be forecast on the basis of individuals\u2019 characteristics and predictions alone\u201d. The macro-phenomena resulting from such micro-level interactions are often complex in nature. We understand complexity as a \u201ctype of condition in which agent behavior and social interaction combine to generate macro-level outcomes that could not be predicted from knowledge of the behavior and nature of interactions alone, and result in sporadic volatile episodes, the timing, magnitude, duration and outcomes of which are themselves unpredictable\u201d (Geller and Moss 2008, p. 322). By contrast, in the study of so called complex networks, the notion of complexity is related to network structures (both local and global) and characteristics that are not statistically significant in a random network (Newman 2004; Wasserman and Faust 1994). We are aware of other definitions of both complexity and complex networks (see Edmonds (1999) for a review), but those given should suffice for the purpose of this chapter.",

It can be interpreted as the response of a slowly driven system such that the outcome of the system\u2019s behavior is limited by the order of the magnitude of its size, thus, leading to the scale-free property (see below). Following Jensen (1998), one may explain SOC as the development of emergent patterns due to interactions among meta-stable agents, so that at some critical state, the result of interactions affects the entire system such that all members of the system influence each other. For the rest of the period, any local distortions resulting from agents\u2019 interactions in their neighborhoods remain confined locally. Systems governed by SOC leave characteristic traces in the data they produce. The data conforms not to the assumption underlying standard statistical methods, namely that the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the data are known and stable. Consequentially, the conditions for standard statistical hypothesis testing and regression techniques are not satisfied anymore, and there are cases where variance is infinite (Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my 2006). However, of more importance to us in the present context is the fact that investigating such signatures provides useful guidance for the analysis of social simulations (Moss 2002). Leptokurtosis in a distribution of relative changes can be a reflection of episodes of volatility that are themselves unpredictable (Moss 2002). That is, unpredictable clustering of volatility and the corresponding extreme events are identifiably complex features of time series. Conversely, finding leptokurtosis in time series data would naturally incline us to look for extreme events. A vital implication of such approaches is that it is practically impossible to predict the outcomes to the system from simple stimuli (Jensen 1998).",

The number of starting vertices is fixed and the chances of a vertex being linked to another are equally likely. Instead, real-world networks evolve over time and exhibit a feature that is called preferential attachment. Albert and Barab\u00e1si address these issues by introducing network growth. The network starts off with a small number of connected vertices. New vertices are added to the network one at a time and are linked to existing vertices. Then they introduce the idea of preferential attachment, meaning the probability that a new vertex is connected to an existing vertex depends upon the connectivity of the vertex, where k is the degree of the i-th vertex in the existing network. The network evolves into a scale-variant such that the degree distribution follows a power law.",

Multiple relations among agents embedded in space are represented as a two-mode sociomatrix, a hypergraph or a bipartite graph, where one representation can equivalently be mapped to another (Wasserman and Faust 1994). Bipartite graphs are useful for simultaneous analysis of both actors and the affiliations (Degenne and Fors\u00e9 1999). Typically, a graph, i.e. a social network, is implemented as an adjacency matrix or a doubly-linked list besides others. Choice of a suitable data structure for manipulating social networks may depend upon the structure of the underlying social network, e.g., single or multiple relations; directed/undirected; weighted edges, etc. Two of the most widely adopted data formats used for social networks are GraphML (Brandes et al. 2004) and DyNetML (Tsvetovat 2005), both based on XML. Both support directed, undirected, and mixed graphs; hypergraphs; hierarchical graphs; and store nodes and edges attributes, for example agents\u2019 characteristics or type or strength of edges (see Tsvetovat (2005) for a comparison of commonly used social network data formats).

Most of them intentionally provide only limited support for network analysis measures such as the basic centrality measures and community detection algorithms (Nikolai and Madey 2009). Dedicated network modeling and analysis libraries such as the Java Universal Network/Graph library (JUNG) (O\u2019Madadhain et al. 2005); the R Project packages statnet, sna, and igraph are to be used for more computationally-extensive handling of network data generated by ABMs. Social network analysis software and APIs provide an interface to read/write social network data in data formats such as GraphML or DyNetML.

Built upon the Swarm modeling platform (Minar et al. 1996), it supports a variety of agent-based modeling techniques and extensions such as a biophysical component, land trade and the effects of climatic variability on land parcels. The FEARLUS simulation begins with the land parcels assigned to land managers. At each annual cycle, managers select the land use of their land parcels based on the available selection strategies. They decide to harvest based on the expected yield for a particular year, select land parcels for sale or to clear off deficits, or decide to retire, allowing new land managers to enter the system. FEARLUS incorporates social and physical neighborhoods. Social neighborhood and spatial distribution are both used by agents, representing farmers or land owners, to observe each other and decide what action to take. Further information on FEARLUS and how the physical and the embedded social neighborhoods are implemented can be found online at http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/fearlus.",

The friendship network is assigned randomly at the start based on the preference parameters: number of friends, neighborhood bias, and bias for racial similarity. Edmonds thus changes the motivation for switching the neighborhood. Instead of intolerance based on race, as implemented by Schelling, fear as a result of personal insecurity makes people leave for another neighborhood. Fear is a function of security related incidences and spreads through the friendship network. Communication of fear depends on the density of the social network on the other hand. At the same time friendship networks are not necessarily in the geographical vicinity of an agent. An agent can thus be attracted away to where its friends live. As a result, social and physical space becomes disjointed.",

In many of these models, the mechanisms generating the social networks have been empirically derived. This stands in stark contrast to modeling exercises where the authenticity of social network generating mechanisms is less of a concern, such as in statistical mechanics. The purpose of many of these models is an explanatory one. Companion (sometimes also called participatory) modeling and role-playing games are certainly at the forefront of an explanatory modeling agenda. The primary objective of companion modeling is to understand complex environments through stakeholder participation, affording to validate model assumptions and to make informed policy recommendations (Barreteau et al. 2001, 2003). Companion modeling stresses that no a priori hypotheses are made about the target system. Priority is thus assigned to evidence gathering during fieldwork. Similarly, role-playing games incorporate a special function in the understanding and validation of ABMs. The idea is to consider role-playing games as \u201cliving\u201d multi-agent systems in which players are the agents and the set of roles is the rule base. Through rule design in collaboration with the players an understanding of the complexity of the system to be modeled is developed.",

The utilization of networks in agent-design and in particular in the agent reasoning processes hence becomes obvious. In this respect the concept of semantic networks offers particular usefulness, for it expresses, in the most general way, relations of meanings between concepts in terms of nodes and links. Semantic networks are thus often used for the representation of knowledge; knowledge that bears \u2013 represented as a semantic network \u2013 some form of content-related domain specificity (DiMaggio 1997).

Analyzing social networks in and generated by agent-based social simulation does not impose new requirements for social network analysis. Metrics such as: geodesic distance; average path length; network density; reachability; clustering; centrality and centralization and their meaning, continue to be useful in that they characterize network topologies and process-based complexity. However, most of the analysis will have to deal with dynamic social networks. Considering only a priori and ex post snapshots of networks is not helpful in identifying network measures for agent-based simulations. Applying graph-theoretic measures over a network snapshot may increase the risk of losing the context of a particular agent\u2019s position in the network (Borgatti et al. 2006; Carley 2003; Edmonds and Chattoe 2005). In complex systems, it is hard to anticipate how emerging patterns result from interactions at the micro-level. It could be thus misleading to apply measures on a single snapshot of the network. Carley\u2019s dynamic network analysis introduces the meta-matrix, a scheme for coping with the problem of multiple relations and co-evolution of both agents (entities, vertices) and their dynamically changing edges (Carley 2003). This approach is further supplemented by combining social network analysis with cognitive science and multiagent systems, the idea being that change in one network may affect change in another. Edmonds and Chattoe (2005) suggest a scheme that makes use of agent-based social simulation in order to find better means for abstraction.",

The network evolves with changes in the agent population, i.e., the agents that participate in a given (social) network. Consequently, the time-series measures of the simulated social network changes as the network evolves. Therein the focus can lie on standard statistical metrics, such as skewness and kurtosis of the absolute relative differences of network measures, such as changes in the clustering coefficient over time. Since we deal with a complex system, we would expect these measures to be indicators for volatile episodes in the time series (Moss and Edmonds 2005). Of course, we would not expect the time-series to be normally distributed and exhibit heteroskedasticity. But in general, for dynamic networks, where the population of participating agents in a network changes over time, we should also look for the stability (or change) of network measures over one or multiple simulation runs. The choice of measures is therefore important when comparing networks of varying sizes within and/or across simulation runs. See McCulloch (2009) and Alam et al. (2009) for methods of detecting patterns in dynamic social networks.",
