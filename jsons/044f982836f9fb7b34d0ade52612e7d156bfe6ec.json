FeIFN-v could not be found in the brain, and only traces could be detected in muscle tissue. 13 Thus, FeIFN-v might not have reached the necessary concentration in all tissues to affect FCoV replication in the cats of the present study. In addition, FeIFN-v has a half-life of 31 6 5 minutes, and treatment intervals in the present study might have been too long. However, its action is much longer than its half-life because FeIFN-v activates the cellular enzyme 29,59-oligoadenylate synthetase, which stays active for more than 3 days after induction. This enzyme is mainly responsible for the antiviral action. 13 Alternatively, treatment might have been initiated too late. If immune-mediated processes in FIP become autonomous and proceed independently of the presence of the virus, a reduction of the virus load through FeIFN-v might not have any appreciable effect. Signs of FIP become apparent 1-2 weeks after experimental inoculation of mutated FCoV. 14 Ideally, therapy should start at the time of the mutation, before the mutated virus replicates and invades different tissues. The time point of mutation, however, cannot be detected because mutation precedes clinical signs, and a diagnosis is not possible until severe immune-mediated reactions are present.",

Cats received an immunosuppressive dose of glucocorticoids (2 mg/kg) in the present study, which seemed to promote secondary infections in 5 cats. These cats had improved, and other infections preceded the recurrence of the signs of FIP. Potentially, a slow tapering of the glucocorticoids might be better in cats living longer than 3 weeks to reduce the risk of secondary infections. In the present study, cats received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and passive immunization in addition. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was chosen because of its broad antimicrobial spectrum and because of its few adverse effects, especially in young cats. However, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is reported to inhibit the interferon-gamma (interferon-c) activity in human lung epithelia cell lines in vitro, 17 but no effect could be detected in an in vivo study in humans. 18 Thus, it might have suppressed endogenous interferon-c in the cats, which is reported to play an important role in the battle against the virus. 19 Potentially, it also might have decreased the effect of the FeIFN-v. The immune serum used as adjunctive therapy reduces the risk for virus infections. 20 No adverse effects of the immune serum are known, and thus, it is unlikely that its application had influence on the outcome of the study.",

In vitro, the antiviral efficacy of human interferon-a against a FIPcausing FCoV strain was demonstrated. 21 B\u00f6 lcskei and Bilkei (1995) 22 treated 29 cats suspected of having FIP with different drugs (in 5 groups), and 1 group received human interferon-a (6 3 10 5 U/cat 5 days a week for 3 weeks), but in this study, FIP was not confirmed but only suspected. Weiss et al (1990) 14 did a study in 74 specific pathogen-free cats (52 treated, 22 controls) in which FIP was induced experimentally. 14 Neither the prophylactic nor the therapeutic administration of high doses of interferon-a (10 4 U/kg or 10 6 U/kg) or feline interferon-beta (10 3 U/kg) significantly reduced mortality in treated versus untreated cats. However, in cats treated with 10 6 U/kg interferon-a, the survival time was significantly increased (from 5 days in untreated cats to 14 days in treated cats) when treatment was started before virus inoculation. The major difference between the study of Weiss et al (1990) 14 and the present study is the time point of treatment initiation. Weiss et al (1990) 14 started the human interferona treatment before virus was inoculated, whereas the FeIFN-v treatment in the present study was started after FIP had developed. FeIFN-v also might be more effective if started earlier, but this is not of relevance in the treatment of cats with FIP in the field because a diagnosis needs to be obtained before treatment is started.",
