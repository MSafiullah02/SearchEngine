This was illustrated by the discovery of the SARS-CoV, which paved the way to an understanding of the origins of the outbreak, specific control measures, diagnostics, and therapeutic initiatives. Discovery of novel viruses may also carry important implications for blood product, organ transplant, bioterrorism, and laboratory safety. Furthermore, the experience with smallpox has shown that viruses and the diseases they cause may be eradicated by global health initiatives.

In a resource-poor setting with minimal access to serological confirmation, the epidemic was initially attributed to hepatitis A. However, the unusual severity of the illness in pregnant women, a feature not associated with hepatitis A infection, prompted investigators to perform extensive clinical and serological surveillance of affected patients. This led to the recognition that patients in the epidemic did not have any serological evidence of recent hepatitis A infection. Case definitions and clinical description of the novel non-A, non-B hepatitis entity enabled the recognition of similar patients globally, leading to the discovery of the hepatitis E virus from the stool of a human volunteer (discussed in detail later) through immunoelectron microscopy.6\n",

Clinical specimens must be of good quality and obtained serially throughout the course of illness to capture the novel virus at the time of peak viral load. Viral load dynamics vary, but in general, specimens that are collected early in the course of the illness just before the illness nadir are likely to contain a high viral load. The clinical syndrome often dictates the sites of specimen collection. For example, lower respiratory tract specimens are particularly valuable in patients presenting with pneumonia. However, specimen collection must not be limited to these sites alone because the detection of the novel virus at body sites distant from the focus of infection may illustrate important points regarding tissue tropism and routes of transmission of the new virus, as was illustrated by the high fecal viral loads of SARS-CoV. In general, respiratory tract aspirates, throat swabs, urine, feces, buffy coat, plasma, tissue biopsy specimens, vesicle fluids, and cerebrospinal fluid may all be considered for virus detection in appropriate clinical settings. In addition, acute and convalescent sera should always be stored to retrospectively identify an antibody response to the newly detected virus. Discovery of a novel virus in specimens does not necessarily mean causality, but the detection of an increasing antibody response in temporal relation to the illness is good evidence in support of an infectious role for the novel agent, especially in situations where Koch postulates cannot be fulfilled.",

Extracted cDNA is digested and ligated to anchor sequences at restriction sites. Two rounds of PCR amplification then follow: the first round uses primers that anneal to the anchor sequences; the second round uses identical primers as the first round, extended by one nucleotide at the 3\u2032 end, outside the anchor sequence and within the putative viral nucleic acid. Because the additional nucleotide may be any one of the nucleotides (A, T, G, or C), it provides 16 possible primer combinations for analysis of the infected material. The PCR products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis to identify unique bands in infected material, which are sequenced. VIDISCA was used to characterize a novel HIV-1 subtype and a torque teno virus variant.46, 48 The VIDISCA procedure has been combined with next-generation sequencing (VIDISCA 454) for the analysis of PCR products and has been applied to tissue, serum, stool, respiratory samples, and cell culture specimens. A procedure for pretreatment of respiratory and stool specimens with convalescent serum for further enrichment of virus particles before VIDISCA 454 amplification and sequencing has been described.73\n",

They are then assembled to form nucleotide sequences from which amino acid sequences can be inferred. Bioinformatic analysis then follows to assess for homology with known viral nucleotide and protein sequences and even de novo virus genome assembly. These sequences are then used to design specific PCR primers that enable subsequent case finding and further genomic characterization. With increasingly sophisticated automation and software support, unbiased high-throughput sequencing of randomly amplified PCR products from pretreated clinical specimens is likely to be an increasingly important method for novel virus screening in clinical specimens and environmental samples. However when compared with other nucleic acid amplification approaches, most of the discovered viruses using the DNase-SISPA approach are nonenveloped virus (Table 2),50, 51, 52, 53 because the presequencing enrichment step may damage the delicate virus envelope.",

Demonstration of viral antigen and nucleic acid in tissue specimens using immunohistochemical stains and specific primers for the novel agent serves as another link in the chain of causation. Causation is definitively established by the fulfillment of traditional Koch postulates in animal models, if available. Once causation is established, the newly found phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the novel virus enable the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and specific antiviral therapy. In addition, the origins of the novel virus may be inferred by field studies of vectors and nonhuman hosts, as in the case of SARS-CoV. Even when the novel virus cannot be conclusively associated with human disease at the time of discovery, the availability of its genetic sequences in public databases is important because the novel virus or a close relative may evolve into an emerging human infection in the future. Rapid recognition of new diseases is possible with pre-existing knowledge of the virus, as illustrated by the relationship between Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the previously identified bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5.27 The discovery of novel viruses continues to play an important role in the control of infectious diseases.",
