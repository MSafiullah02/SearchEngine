            "text": "We consider settings of group decision and negotiation where agents' preferences (such as intentions, beliefs and opinions) are influenced by each other and thus their behaviors are possibly changed. We build a multi-agent system (MAS IITIB ) in the context of social networks to model the mutual influence among agents' intentions and the transformation from agents' intentions to their behaviors in groups. On the micro level of individual agents, we construct the self-evolution rule of agents' intentions and the generation, constraint and termination rule of agents' behaviors; on the macro level of networked structure, we describe the mutual influence on intentions among agents, which can be diversified in both strength and polarity. We detail this multi-agent system and run experiments and simulations using the interaction of fertility intentions and the generation of fertility behaviors in families as example. Two experimental programs are designed: one is to adjust the initial fertility intentions of prospective parents, and the other is to adjust the range of weight of influence among family members, to investigate the effects on the childbearing behavior and the number of newborn children in the long-term. This study intends to provide modeling bases for the dynamics of preferences and behaviors due to mutual influence among agents in groups, particularly for the study of fertility intention and behavior in families, and more broadly, the forecast of population growth and effects of fertility policy. It is an innovative try of distributed artificial intelligence (multi-agent system) in the field of demography and public policy, and provides with a new bottom-to-up perspective and unconventional agent-based method.",

During the process of a group decision or negotiation, an agent usually has full motivation to influence others' preferences or behaviors with his/her own preferences or behaviors, to make them believe what he/she believes, behave as what he/she behaves, thus increasing the possibility that his/her preference or behavior becomes the mainstream of the group, and gaining more utility and satisfaction [20] .",

Actually, this is a fundamental feature of a multi-agent system (such as a group decision and negotiation) where there is no agent as an (absolute) authority who can command and control other agents' behaviors [19] ; thus, influencing an agent's preference is the precondition of influencing his/her behavior. Therefore, in the context of a group decision and negotiation, not only the mutual influence among agents' preferences should be discussed, but also the transformation from agents' influenced preferences to their behaviors needs to be investigated. In fact, an influenced (updated) preference will possibly lead to the adoption of a (new) behavior, or not [21] . There is randomness due to bounded rationality and changing environment. The conditions for the generation of behaviors under influence is an important issue that deserves full discussions.",

In fact, a family is a very typical group composed of more than one member, with abundant group behaviors and full of constant communications among members. The interactions among family members consist of typical group decisions and negotiations. Particularly in a \"democratic\" instead of \"dictatorial\" family, all family members collectively make decisions and ceaselessly negotiate on critical family issues, such as whether and when to bear a child. This kind of decision will profoundly change the life of a family in the long-term, thus, all family members will join the process of decision-making and usually all try their best to convince and influence other members with their own preferences in order to achieve a desirable result. For example, a couple does not want to bear a child, but the couple's parents may have strong intentions to have a grandchild and will try to convince the couple from time to time; on the other side, the couple may resist their parents' \"traditional\" opinions and even try to sell their own \"modern\" ideas to their parents. Therefore, the case of fertility intention and behavior in families could be a perfect example to study the mutual influence among preferences and its transformation to behaviors in groups.",

            "text": "The fertility rate and population growth have always been a critical issue in human society. Particularly in China, families' reproductive behaviors are profoundly affected and constrained by the population and fertility policies. The well-known fertility policy in China was simplified as the \"one-child policy\", which had been strictly enforced on childbearing behaviors (especially of urban residents) for more than three decades [10, 28] . Under the one-child policy, 36% of the population strictly had only one child; 53% of the population were permitted to have a second child if their first child was a girl; 9.6% of the population were permitted to have two children regardless of their first child's gender; and 1.6% (mainly ethnic minority) had no limit at all [3] . It implies an average of 1.47 children per couple [11] , falling far under the international population replacement rate of 2.1 (which means the population of China will be decreasing fast in the future). The tremendous reduction in fertility rate, together with the improved life expectancy and other demographic and socioeconomic factors, has forced China to face a more rapid and serious challenge of population aging than other countries (particularly the so-called \"aging before getting rich\" 1 ). From January 1st, 2016, China officially abandoned the one-child family planning policy, allowing all couples in China to have two children regardless of their household registration type (i.e., urban or rural hukou), region, ethnicity, and sibship size [25] . The new policy is called the \"universal two-child policy\". Because of this major change of fertility policy, approximately an additional 90 million women have become eligible to have the second child [31] . The implications of the universal two-child policy are of great public interest and policy concern. However, the fertility intention and actual fertility behavior may significantly differ from what is intended by the policy. A few studies have estimated the long-term effects of this new policy on fertility level and population aging [30, 32] . Till now, the actual fertility rate under the new policy has been much lower than the government's expectation.",

This paper introduces an agent-based modeling and simulation approach for the study of fertility behavior and population growth. It is based on a set of intelligent and autonomous agents that can communicate, interact and influence with each other. Each agent represents an individual member of a family and a multi-agent system represents the interaction among family members. In each interaction, every agent's preference (namely, a family member's fertility intention) is influenced by his/her own and other agents' preferences (namely, other family members' fertility intentions). Under certain conditions based on fertility intentions, a fertility behavior of the family will be produced (namely, a child to be born).",

Our agent-based model handles the complicated multiple influencing relationships (stronger or weaker, positive or negative) among individual members in families, and the transformation from family members' fertility intentions to prospective mothers' fertility behaviors with consideration of randomness. In our research, we designed a series of experimental programs, and monitored the dynamics of fertility intentions and behaviors, and particularly the number of new born children in the long-term. We hope that our results would contribute to discovering important factors that affect the fertility behavior and population growth under different policies (particularly under consideration of the policy changed from the one-child policy to the universal two-child policy in China) and help the government to adjust policies and strategies for the well-being of society.

In the future, the contributions of other disciplines such as logic and psychology, cognitive science and behavior science, particularly the empirical evidences in these fields, would be much valuable. -We assumed a linear relation between agents' intentions and the generation of their behaviors: the higher an agent's intention is, the more possible it is to produce a behavior, and the return brought by the increase of intention is proportional. While in reality, there may be some thresholds of intentions for the generation of behaviors, which means the increase of intention within certain range may have very limited impacts, but once beyond a certain threshold, the return brought by the increase of intention will be much tremendous.

From the economic (rational) perspective on fertility behavior, a utility-based approach may be recommended. In this approach, prospective parents may try to optimize the expected utility combing both assistance and care in the elderly period provided by their children and expense defrayed and energy consumed during the childhood of their children. Economists may encourage us to introduce to the agentbased model some economic variables. -We assumed one usual household structure composed of a husband and a wife, both two (prospective) grandparents on each side, and several relatives and close friends on each side. But in real-world situations, there are more kinds of household structure, for instance, there are not four grandparents alive. More household structures can be designed in future work, particularly according to the result of the census of population. -We mainly discussed the interaction of fertility intentions and the generation of fertility behaviors in families under the impact of population policy transition. While the fertility intention and behavior are closely related to cultural traditions which are hard to be measured from a computational perspective. For instance, in China, the effectiveness of the implementation of population polices are quite different in different areas.
