Regardless of geographic location, COVID-19 will impact all practitioners; however, the degree will vary based on COVID-19 burden and available local resources. Given this variability, decisions regarding cancer care delivery should be individualized, and institutional and government mandates prioritized based on locoregional factors. Special considerations are needed with regard to decisions of systemic cancer-directed therapy and clinical trial enrollment during this unprecedented time. Chemotherapy and other anti-cancer treatments may result in significant immune compromise in patients, rendering them more susceptible to viral and other infectious illnesses. The recent Wuhan experience of 1524 patients reported in JAMA Oncology noted that the infection rate in cancer patients was double that of general population (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.89\u20133.02) [1]. In addition, over 41% of COVID-19 infections were contracted in the hospital [2]. Cancer patients admitted were at higher risk of severe events (composite endpoint: percentage of patients admitted to ICU, ventilated, or death) compared with patients without cancer (seven [39%] of 18 patients vs 124 [8%] of 1572 patients; Fisher's exact p = 0.0003). Lastly, patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery within the previous month had a numerically higher risk of severe events [3]. Though these were small series reported in China with differences in cancer care and no gynecologic cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period, the findings are informative in helping us understand the potential risks to our patients with cancer.",

Nonetheless, chemotherapy has a therapeutic benefit, and careful deliberation is required in the decision-making surrounding anti-cancer therapy and clinical trials management during this challenging time (Table 1\n).",

While NACT can avoid many of these challenges, it does require a biopsy for pathologic confirmation, and chemotherapy will still result in an immunocompromised state. Randomized phase 3 trials, including EORTC and CHORUS, demonstrated that NACT is not inferior to primary surgical cytoreduction with respect to overall and progression-free survival, with lower morbidity [4,5]. NACT in patients with advanced stage disease is a viable alternative to PDS when resources for surgical intervention are restricted during the pandemic crisis.",

While both agents prolong progression-free survival, one must consider incremental benefit and the risk of traveling for infusion as well as the risk of immunosuppression and COVID-19 infection when selecting use. Oral agents are preferred and PARPi can be utilized especially in biomarker positive (i.e. BRCA 1/2 mutation and HRD) patients. When utilizing PARPi maintenance adequate time should be allowed for bone marrow recovery and consideration should be given to delaying initiation of PARPi (8\u201312 weeks). Selection of PARPi should take into consideration the need for laboratory analysis, and ease of modifications for toxicity and dosing via telehealth modalities. Thoughtful incorporation of bevacizumab with chemotherapy in high-risk disease (stage IV, symptomatic pleural effusion/ascites) may decrease symptoms more quickly and keep patients from needing hospitalization or other interventions; the risk of added toxicity must be considered. In the maintenance setting, consider bevacizumab use based on assessment of COVID-19 exposure risk vs. benefit.",

While prospective data regarding early treatment of asymptomatic recurrence are limited, a randomized trial of 527 patients treated for recurrent ovarian cancer based on CA125 level alone compared to clinical or symptomatic relapse demonstrated no difference in overall survival between these two groups [28]. Additionally, case series have reported that between 41 and 83% of endometrial cancer patients and between 46 and 95% of cervical cancer patients will have symptoms at the time of recurrence, even in the setting of surveillance, suggesting that remote telemedicine visits can identify many patients with potential recurrence [37]. For patients in whom chemotherapy is being considered, emerging data have reported both higher rate of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients as well as increased risk of severe events, especially in patients who have received recent cancer-directed therapy [1,3,38]. As such, when making decisions about proceeding with therapy for recurrent disease and choice of therapy regimen, careful consideration must be made regarding the benefits of therapy in terms of symptomatic relief, survival, and prevention of hospitalization, compared to the risks of increased exposure to the medical setting for therapy, possible complications of therapy, and potential for increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity.",

The Geriatric 8 panel (G8) is a concise version of the geriatric assessment tool (18 items) and assesses frailty. The lower the score (< 14), the more frail the patient may be and the higher the risk for chemotherapy related toxicities. The 8-item scale may be completed by phone using the patient's reported weight [49]. The Cancer Aging Research Group (CARG) toxicity calculator (http://www.mycarg.org/Chemo_Toxicity_Calculator) is a simple, complimentary, online tool that provides a percentage of chemotherapy related toxicity (grade 3\u20135) based on patient information and selected regimens [50,51].

There is no proven benefit to adjuvant therapy in stage I or stage II uLMS [53]. For advanced or recurrent uLMS the gemcitabine/docetaxel doublet has demonstrated activity in prior trials, but requires administration on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle and is associated with significant hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia, necessitating use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors [[54], [55], [56]]. Single agent doxorubicin is probably the optimal first-line treatment option during the COVID-19 crisis. In a phase III trial comparing doxorubicin q 21 days to the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel every three weeks in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were similar in both arms [57]. Dose delays and dose reductions were frequent in both groups, with the main reason being febrile neutropenia. Single-agent doxorubicin in the front-line setting should be considered, after balancing these risks with gemcitabine/docetaxel and the patient's risk of cardiac dysfunction with doxorubicin during the COVID-19 crisis. Pazopanib is an oral tyrosine-kinase which represents an option with activity in uLMS [52]. Aromatase inhibitors have limited toxicity and can result in stable disease in patients with ER positive uLMS [58]. With all of these non-curative therapies, the toxicity and risk of viral infection during treatment must be weighed against the potential benefit of these therapies.",

Either the 8-day or 5-day regimens are acceptable for women with a WHO score of \u22646 but both regimens require frequent visits for the injections which may increase exposure to viral infection [66,67]. A small series of an oral 5-day regimen has been described with outcomes that are similar to those reported with methotrexate injections and could be considered to reduce the risk of exposure or when infusion resources are limited [68]. Dactinomycin at 1.25 mg/m2 has the advantage of every 2 week dosing and has been shown to be superior to weekly methotrexate [69]. However, the success rate for this regimen was only 44% in women with a WHO score of 5\u20136 and generally should be given through a central line to reduce the risk of extravasation injury. All regimens should be continued until 3 treatments past a normal hCG defined as (<5 mIU/ml) [64]. The inpatient EMA-CO regimen is recommended for patients with high risk disease (WHO > 6).",

Clinical trials should be prioritized based on the study type and benefit potential (Table 5\n). Tier 2 and non-essential Tier 3 (tissue and non-therapeutic studies) are not enrolling at many centers. Before enrolling new patients consider COVID-19 burden and trial conduct capability including staffing, imaging, procedures, and research labs acquisition. Minimize non-critical visits and patient interactions between physicians and research coordinators using telemedicine to conduct visits and assessment of toxicity, symptoms, and concomitant medications. Arrange for delivery of investigative oral drugs directly to patients if possible and obtain labs and imaging locally. Inform and follow sponsor and IRB guidelines regarding deviations and patients diagnosed with COVID-19 while on study.",
