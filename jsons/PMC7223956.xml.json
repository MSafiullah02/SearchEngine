One of the limitations to exploit exclusively stable transgenic systems for recombinant protein production is the length of time\u2014ranging from months to years\u2014required for their development (Sukenik et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2015). This problem has been overcome with the introduction of transient expression methods for whole-plant expression systems, where Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of vector DNA into most of the cells of a plant results in rapid and often high-level production of recombinant proteins (Rybicki 2010).",

Therefore, it is not surprising that this technology has been intensely studied in terms of its use for recombinant protein production. Although whole plants are more commonly used as plant-based production platforms via stable or transient expression, a number of studies involving plant cell suspension cultures as the production host have been published (Doran 2000; Hellwig et al. 2004; Tekoah et al. 2015). As with other eukaryotic expression systems, plant cells allow for post-transcriptional modifications of RNA and post-translational modifications of the protein of interest. Unlike bacterial and mammalian cells, plant cells are well suited for safe production of foreign proteins, as they are not a source of pathogens harmful to humans. One of the properties that favours the use of plant cell cultures over whole plants is the fact that cultivation takes place under fully controlled sterile conditions in chemically defined media (H\u00e4kkinen et al. 2018), which allows the production of recombinant proteins according to the current good manufacturing practice (Fischer et al. 2005). The high-value product can also be more easily recovered and purified, especially when the product is secreted into the culture medium (Fischer et al. 1999).",

Secretion of the protein into the culture medium has so far been the preferred approach, as the secreted proteins can be recovered from the culture supernatant following free diffusion from the apoplast without any cell disruption (Fischer et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2011). The latest approach, which utilizes tobacco BY-2 cells in the form of three-dimensional (3D) medium-deprived porous plant cell aggregates (so-called plant cell packs\u2014PCP), is a medium-free method: no medium supplements to either enhance protein stability or reduce protein degradation are required. In addition, the method itself has been shown to be very efficient and very quick, with the expression levels after a few days of various recombinant proteins in the range of 50\u2013100 mg/kg (Rademacher et al. 2019).",

            "text": "Transient expression systems utilising virus-based vectors have the advantage of rapid and high-level expression of foreign proteins within a few days, compared to non-replicating systems (Yamamoto et al. 2018). Several plant virus-derived expression vector systems have been designed, and the most efficient ones described to date are based on DNA viruses, specifically geminiviruses (Hefferon 2014; Rybicki and Martin 2014), or single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, such as tobamoviruses, potexviruses and comoviruses (Hefferon 2017). Bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV), a geminivirus in the genus Mastrevirus, has a single-stranded circular DNA genome that can replicate to a very high copy-number as a plasmid-like dsDNA form via a rolling circle replication mechanism in the plant cell nucleus. BeYDV-derived expression vectors have been created by replacing the capsid protein (CP) and movement protein (MP) encoding sequences with a transgene expression cassette (Chen et al. 2011). One of the BeYDV-based expression vectors, pRIC, additionally includes the BeYDV replication associated elements (rep) in cis (Regnard et al. 2010). The vector DNA excises itself as a smaller replicon from the tumor-inducing (Ti) DNA of Agrobacterium tumefaciens by Rep-mediated rolling circle release. The pRIC expression system was used in Nicotiana benthamiana plants to generate Human papillomavirus type16 (HPV-16) L1 capsid protein as well as Human immunodeficiency virus-1 type C p24 antigen derived from the Gag protein at yields up to ten-fold higher than a non-replicating form of the vector, and yields up to 1 mg/g fresh leaf tissue were obtained in another study that used a similar vector (Lai et al. 2012). The BeYDV-derived pRIC and similar vectors are also suitable for co-expression strategies, unlike the ssRNA virus-derived vectors, because of a lack of superinfection exclusion of other genomes (Rybicki and Martin 2014).",

Here, we focus on both transient expression and co-expression of two proteins in BY-2 cells, which had earlier been described in whole plants (Chen et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2010; Montague et al. 2011; Sainsbury et al. 2009). We chose to use the PCP technology (Rademacher et al. 2019), combining the advantages of fast-growing cell suspension cultures (specific growth rate up to 0.044/h for tobacco cell lines) (Xu et al. 2011) with those of transient protein expression assays to study the efficiency of replicating expression vectors derived from the pRIC vector (Regnard et al. 2010). In this work, we designed new vectors which also contain 5\u2032/3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) from Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) which are present in the enhanced pEAQ expression vector (Sainsbury and Lomonossoff 2008): these contribute to the stability and hypertranslability of RNA transcripts (Chen et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2010; Montague et al. 2011; Sainsbury et al. 2009). Our new vectors containing identical expression cassettes were evaluated in terms of their ability to express and especially co-express the two reporter proteins, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (DsRed), in tobacco BY-2 cells using the PCP technology.",

First, the expression of fluorescent proteins from replicating pGB-R vectors containing either GFP (pGB-R-GFP) or DsRed (pGB-R-DsRed) expression cassette, alternatively combined with P19 (pGB-R-GFP-P19 and pGB-R-DsRed-P19), was compared. Both GFP and DsRed fluorescence was observed in the PCPs illuminated by UV or green light, respectively (Fig. 2a, middle and right column). No DsRed fluorescence was observable in the cell packs infused by Agrobacterium harbouring pGB-R-GFP and pGB-R-GFP-P19 expression vectors and vice versa, no GFP fluorescence was noticed when pGB-R-DsRed or pGB-R-DsRed-P19 vectors were applied. Likewise, no green or red fluorescence was detected in control cell packs infused with MS medium only. Similarly, the Agrobacterium suspension itself did not show any GFP and DsRed fluorescence (Fig. S1). It was noticed that the fluorescence intensity peaked at 4 days after the PCP infusion and declined afterwards (not shown), therefore it was quantified at 4 days after infusion. The pGB-R-GFP vector resulted in approximately threefold lower fluorescence when compared to the pGB-R-GFP-P19. On the other hand, the P19 showed no effect on DsRed fluorescence when expressed from pGB-R-DsRed-P19 compared to pGB-R-DsRed (Fig. 2b).",

While use of pGB-R-GFP-DsRed resulted in no significant difference between GFP and DsRed fluorescence intensity, a relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the expression cassette position within the vector was observed for pGB-R-DsRed-GFP vector.

These findings are partially in line with mRNA expression levels (Fig. 4a), as lower GFP/DsRed mRNA levels were not necessarily coupled with lower protein yields and vice versa. For example, pGB-R-DsRed produced a 1.8-fold lower mRNA level than its counterpart containing P19, but the protein yields were similar for both vectors.
