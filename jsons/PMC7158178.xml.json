Less common but important considerations are leptospirosis, chikungunya, acute schistosomiasis, and amebic liver abscess. All of these diseases have widespread distribution in the tropics and need to be considered initially in all febrile travelers. Some may be ruled out quickly based on a detailed travel and exposure history and consultation with relevant information sources on disease distribution. Upper and lower respiratory tract infection, including streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza, as well as urinary tract infections, are cosmopolitan, nontropical febrile disorders that are remarkably common in travelers and should always be considered. In every series from sophisticated referral centers, up to 22% to 25% of those presenting with fever have self-limited illnesses that never have an etiologic diagnosis confirmed.7 These are mostly viral syndromes caused by one of hundreds of viral agents that exist outside developed countries for which diagnostic tests may not be available anywhere. In many cases, the time and expense of a large panel of viral isolation and serologic assays is not warranted outside the research setting. Fever due to deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism may be related to travel, especially in those with preexisting conditions or underlying coagulopathy. Thromboembolic disease always needs to be considered from the outset but is not discussed further here.8, 9\n",

Some individuals are frequent travelers, so all travel for at least the previous 6 months must be considered initially. If the diagnosis remains elusive, a more remote travel history, especially that involving malarious areas, may be sought. The exact date of arrival back in the home country is often crucial to ascertain the last possible exposure date to an exotic pathogen. These details are most efficiently ascertained using a waiting room questionnaire. For example, it is insufficient to know simply that the patient visited Peru. Some parts of Peru are malarious and others are not, only some have risk of yellow fever, high-altitude destinations have little risk of vector-borne disease, and there is no risk of strongyloidiasis along the desert coastal strip.",

Knowledge of typical incubation periods (Table 324-2\n) of possible infectious causes is a key tool in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Many agents are simply not biologically possible outside their usual incubation period. Arboviral diseases such as dengue uniformly have short incubation periods. Onset of illness more than 2 weeks after the last possible exposure effectively rules out this class of viral illness. None of the known hemorrhagic fever viruses has a possible incubation longer than 21 days. Long-incubation infections like schistosomiasis cannot present less than several weeks after first possible exposure. Some diseases such as malaria or enteric fever have more variable incubation periods but nevertheless have a typical incubation period during which time the majority of the patients present. A number of diseases, especially those that are arthropod borne, have a strict seasonality whereby transmission stops during either cold or dry weather. Examples would include malaria in nontropical countries such as Korea, Tajikistan, or northern China, as well as Lyme borreliosis or tick-borne encephalitis, all of which completely cease transmission during winter months. GeoSentinel surveillance data indicate that dengue cases in travelers show marked region-specific peaks for Southeast Asia (June, September), South-Central Asia (October), South America (March), and the Caribbean (August, October).11, 12\n",

Classic periodic malarial fever is not a usual manifestation of imported malaria, although when fever does occur in discrete, repeated 48- or 72-hour cycles, the diagnosis is almost certain. The simian malaria parasite P. knowlesi,\n26 which is now known to commonly infect humans in Malaysia and throughout Southeast Asia, uniquely has a periodicity of 24 hours.

Fever is absent at the exact time of the initial medical assessment in up to 40% of patients with malaria. Respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms may be predominant.

Blood cultures are not always positive, but bone marrow cultures increase the yield. Serologic assays, including agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have overall poor sensitivity, especially early in the course, and some lack of specificity in some settings and enjoy poor reputations.

High fever, headache, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common. Rickettsiae infect endothelial cells and often cause widespread vasculitic-looking lesions. Severe infections may present as disseminated intravascular coagulation and mimic a viral hemorrhagic fever. Because African tick-bite fever and scrub typhus both occur in malarious areas, a thick film is indicated even in febrile patients with pathognomonic skin lesions. Because response to tetracyclines is uniformly prompt and dramatic and the results of serologic tests are slow to return, clinical suspicion and clinical diagnosis are usually relied on.

Risk factors include stays at large air-conditioned resort hotels or spas and cruise ship travel.38 Acute histoplasmosis can be seen after brief excursions into caves anywhere in the Americas, and travel-related coccidioidomycosis is reported.39 Tuberculosis is a clear risk in those who spend longer periods in very high-risk countries and especially those who are doing medical or aid work.40, 41 Pulmonary infiltrates and symptoms may be seen during the migratory phases of helminthiases such as schistosomiasis, strongyloidosis, hookworm infestation, and ascariasis. Hemorrhagic pneumonitis may be seen with leptospirosis. Q fever should be sought in those with animal exposure. Workup should be guided by clinical and radiologic findings.",

Arenavirus infection, whether from West Africa (Lassa virus) or South America (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito viruses), should be treated with ribavirin. Most also recommend treating Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever with ribavirin.42 Other rare hemorrhagic fevers of travelers such as Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever need to be supported with the best possible intensive care.43 Meningococcemia and rickettsial infection present as purpuric lesions, and bacterial sepsis and severe malaria are serious but treatable causes of hemorrhage owing to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Any febrile patient with altered sensorium or any other evidence of end-organ damage consistent with malaria and in whom P. falciparum malaria is a possibility should receive empirical therapy for malaria regardless of the result of a blood film.

The blood film may also diagnose bartonellosis, acute trypanosomiasis, and relapsing fever. Leukopenia militates away from common bacterial infections and toward dengue, typhoid, brucellosis, rickettsial disease, or acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thrombocytopenia is indicative of malaria, dengue, or brucellosis. Eosinophilia may indicate early migratory stages of a number of helminths (see later). Liver function test results will be consistently abnormal in viral hepatitis or toxin damage and variably abnormal in leptospirosis, rickettsial disease (including Q fever), relapsing fever, yellow fever, amebic abscess, brucellosis, typhoid, hemorrhagic fever, and dengue.

In the absence of enlightening abnormalities, additional serologic studies may need to be obtained based on travel itinerary, incubation periods, and known exposures, as discussed previously. HIV infection and its complications, syphilis, and tuberculosis should be sought at this stage if there is any suggestive exposure at all. After ruling out potentially serious as well as potentially treatable infections by history, physical examination, and routine laboratory work, and especially if patient financial resources are limiting, the clinician must then decide whether to wait 48 to 72 hours before serology and sophisticated diagnostic studies are pursued. Because up to 25% of all febrile illnesses in returning travelers are self-limited viral syndromes, a patient who was highly febrile and quite toxic looking at initial assessment is quite often perfectly well 48 hours later with no intervention. Reasonable clinical and local laboratory experience and confidence are required for this approach, but from the patient standpoint it is the most desirable course. At a minimum, acute serum should be stored for possible later use. If the patient is stable, has no laboratory abnormalities and no clinical evidence of end-organ damage, and has a reliable companion, he or she may be followed as an outpatient during the clinical evolution and the appropriate workup pursued according to any ensuing clinical findings.",

However, quinolone-resistant typhoid and paratyphoid fever are now predominant in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, where much of the travel-related enteric fever originates. Thus, in this situation, if clinical suspicion is high, the patient may need to be admitted for parenteral therapy. Empirical therapy for malaria without a positive blood film is appropriate if clinical evidence of cerebral dysfunction or any other end-organ damage consistent with malaria is present. Otherwise, examination of these patients and of serial blood smears over several days by someone with appropriate experience will generally lead to the parasitologic diagnosis of malaria, when present.44 Expertise is rarely so far away as to compromise patient care, although empirical therapy with co-artemether or atovaquone-proguanil is generally well tolerated. However, empirical treatment will necessarily eliminate any possibility of making a species diagnosis if the patient, in fact, does have malaria. After empirical treatment, the clinician is then probably obligated to a course of primaquine, a potentially toxic drug, to cover the possibility that the antecedent infection was due to relapsing (P. vivax or P. ovale) malaria.",

Returned travelers with acute diarrhea of a few days' duration who have not yet had a course of quinolone antibiotic can be prescribed an empirical course without any workup or stool culture. Toxic patients with bloody diarrhea should have a wet prep of stool and an immediate sigmoidoscopic examination to look for amebic trophozoites. Nonresponders at 36 to 48 hours should then have stool specimen sent for performance of bacterial culture, ova and parasite testing, acid-fast bacilli testing (to detect Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora), Giardia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay, Entamoeba ELISA, and Clostridium difficile toxin assay. Vibrio cultures usually require a special request.

These patients' disorders can be extremely frustrating to deal with because diagnosis is most often elusive despite extensive diagnostic testing.55 Clearly, some undiscovered enteric pathogens remain. A number of limited studies indicate that the incidence of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome at 6 months after an acute episode of traveler's diarrhea may range from 4% to 32%. The true incidence of this syndrome is not clear, and ancillary contributing factors and possible preemptive interventions are still being investigated.56 Appropriate studies, in addition to those already listed, include HIV serology, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, thyroid function tests, serum calcium, testing for malabsorption, anti\u2013Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody/antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody serologic studies for inflammatory bowel disease, antigliadin/antiendomysial/antitransglutamase antibodies for celiac disease, and upper and lower endoscopy with all aspirates and biopsy samples examined carefully for a parasitic cause. G. lamblia, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cyclospora cayetanensis are occasional infectious causes of persistent diarrhea and may be discovered only after invasive workup. Serology for S. stercoralis, Schistosoma mansoni, or E. histolytica is indicated when exposure to these agents may have occurred. Intestinal biopsy almost always yields nonspecific findings, although cases of tropical or nontropical sprue are occasionally discovered or an initial diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease made. In many patients, the etiology of the frequently found nonspecific villus blunting is unclear. This syndrome has often been termed tropical enteropathy or postinfective tropical malabsorption and is believed to be the residual damage caused by an initial bacterial or other insult. A temporary luminal disaccharidase deficiency may occur. Diarrhea may persist for months before resolving. In the absence of definitive diagnosis in patients with chronic traveler's diarrhea, symptomatic treatment with loperamide is indicated. Elimination diets with restriction of lactose, fructose, gluten, and fat are sometimes of benefit. Those with preexisting irritable bowel syndrome may have it unmasked by travel and frequently have exacerbations during or after travel. Tegaserod, alosetron, antispasmodics, or other appropriate medication for the underlying disease may be needed.56, 57, 58, 59\n",

The most common skin-related diagnoses are cutaneous larva migrans (9.8% of all skin diagnoses), insect bites including superinfected bites (15%), skin abscess (7.7%), and allergic reaction (5.5%). Dengue (3.4%), leishmaniasis (3.3%), myiasis (2.7%), and the rickettsial spotted-fever diseases (1.5%) are other important reasons for presentation. Arthropod-related skin diseases accounted for 31% of all skin diagnoses.60, 61 Ulcerative lesions of travelers include leishmaniasis, mycobacterial disease, deep mycoses, and, rarely, anthrax. Rickettsial diseases frequently include black eschars at the site of the arthropod bite. Loiasis,62 gnathostomiasis,63 and cysticercosis present as painless subcutaneous nodules. Arthropod bites and infestations such as scabies, fleas, lice, and mites present similarly as in nontropical environments. Onchocerciasis presents as an intensely pruritic, evanescent papular rash.64, 65 Varicella, measles, or other childhood exanthems occur in nonimmune travelers and should not be forgotten in the quest for exotic diagnoses. Seabather's eruption (sometimes called \u201csea lice\u201d) is a pruritic papular rash notable for being distributed only on skin covered by the patient's bathing suit.66 Larval sea anemones become trapped by the fabric while the patient is swimming. The indurated erythematous chancre of Trypanosoma rhodesiense infection (see Chapter 279) should not be overlooked.67 Arboviral eruptions usually present as acute febrile illnesses and not as predominant rash illnesses. HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases should always be considered as a cause of exanthems and ulcerative lesions.",

During the initial larval migration phase after a new infection with a specific parasite (e.g., hookworm), there may be an intense eosinophilia (up to 5000/mm3). Weeks or months later, when the mature adults reside in the intestine with only minimal tissue contact, eosinophilia will be mild or absent. Although eosinophilia is not seen in protozoan infection, local eosinophilic infiltrates exceptionally occur in areas of the intestinal tract penetrated by E. histolytica, G. lamblia, or Cystoisospora belli.\n",

Exceptions are those with known discrete high-risk exposure events in situations conducive to transmission of specific agents. This would include testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, a purified protein derivative skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assay, or Schistosoma serology.

For general screening, a stool sample for ova and parasite testing and an eosinophil count are used by most. Serologic studies for schistosomiasis, filarial infection, and strongyloidiasis are often performed but should be strictly limited to those with extended travel to a known endemic area for each pathogen tested for. Those with new sexual partners should be screened for HIV and sexually transmitted infections at an appropriate interval after last potential exposure.
