Existing global public health scholarship that does analyze this issue finds only a weak positive association between health capacity and reporting (McAlarnen et al. 2014). But, this work either does not examine variation across states (Chan et al. 2010; Mondor et al. 2012), or the empirical work on reporting delays does not theorize about how political factors might influence outbreak reporting or test these factors against alternative explanations like surveillance capacity (see Brownstein et al. 2008; Davies 2012; Kluberg et al. 2016).",

Coined as the managerial approach by Chayes and Chayes (1998), this view argues that noncompliance is not the result of intentional shirking. Instead, states generally want to abide by their commitments, but doing so often requires legal, bureaucratic, economic, or other specialized expertise, not to mention absolute political control, that many states lack.",

Compliance decisions can have political consequences for states at the international and domestic levels, and governments weigh these costs and benefits. Though capacity to comply is undoubtedly a prerequisite for doing so, those that are able to comply must also consider the reaction of other states and the domestic consequences of complying or not complying. On the one hand, states might consider the geopolitical costs and benefits of compliance decisions and their behavior might be driven by fear of punishment from other states in the form of withholding aid, trade, or cooperation in other areas (Keohane 1984; Simmons 2000; Simmons and Elkins 2004). From this perspective, reputational interests and reciprocity matter most, and states base their compliance behavior on the likelihood of material or normative punishment.",

For example, breaking international commitments, especially legalized ones, may be particularly costly for leaders of states with a strong commitment to domestic rule of law for normative reasons or because domestic constituents fear that the disregard of international law could translate into the domestic sphere (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Abbott and Snidal 2000; Kelley 2007). Some scholars focus on regime type and its influence on leaders\u2019 domestic political interests, finding that democracies are more likely to comply because constituents pressure their governments to follow through with their commitments (see, for example, Gaubatz 1996; Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorff 2002; Neumayer 2002). Others argue that the public is not necessarily procompliance and show that the positive effect of participatory democracy is conditional on the presence of strong procompliance domestic interests (Dai 2006). Indeed, compliance with agreements dealing with politically charged issues like the environment, trade, human rights, territory, or arms control, for example, can have different domestic consequences in different types of states. In short, governments only comply when the benefits of doing so outweigh the international and/or domestic level costs, and noncompliance from this perspective is thus due to a failure of enforcement.",

States may want to report and may in fact quickly do so once an outbreak is discovered. But, weak surveillance capacity can delay outbreak discovery, which means that, in spite of the government's good intentions, significant time passes between the start of the outbreak and when it is publicly communicated. Alternatively, states may intentionally conceal an outbreak even after they are aware of it because reporting comes with costs\u2014including unavoidable economic costs associated with outbreaks and the economic and political costs of being the target of other states\u2019 trade and travel barriers. From this perspective, states will only be likely to report and follow through with commitments to the IHR when they anticipate minimal costs for doing so.",

In terms of reducing the costs of reporting and ensuring that other states do not impose trade and travel barriers that have little public health rationale, the regulations have always laid out the maximum measures that other states can take in the name of protection from disease spread. But, the regulations originally only applied to three diseases (cholera, plague, and yellow fever), and even with respect to those diseases, states frequently imposed more restrictive measures than allowed by the regulations, and outbreak reporting was often delayed, if it happened at all (Carvalho and Zacher 2001).

Though states agreed to meet the core health capacity requirements when they signed on to the new IHR in 2005, this commitment came with no funding attached. Most countries that lack these capacities are not able to build them alone. And, even self-reported assessments of progress toward meeting these capacities suggest limited improvement. In 2014, states had the opportunity to submit requests for a second extension to the deadline for meeting these core health capacities. At that time, only 64 states reported that they had met the capacities, while 81 states requested an additional two year extension, and 48 did not provide the WHO with any information (World Health Organization 2015a, 4; see also, Fischer and Katz 2013). In 2016, 76 states did not provide an update on progress and the majority of states have still not yet fully met the core capacities (World Health Organization 2017a, 3; see also Gostin and Katz 2016). The launch of an external evaluation process (called the Joint External Evaluation) to monitor progress on the core capacities is a promising step, but states voluntarily submit to these external evaluations (World Health Organization 2016a). As such, weak capacity may still play a role in reporting delays. The 2014 Ebola crisis offers an example. The slow response to the outbreak was due in part to weak surveillance capacity in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. It is telling that Nigeria\u2014a country with far greater resources than Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone\u2014was able to quash the spread of Ebola in the country by implementing several of the capacities recommended by the IHR, including contact tracing, monitoring of contacts, and rapid isolation of potentially infectious cases (Fasina et al. 2014).",

First, the specter of international economic costs might influence state behavior. In this case, states that are more enmeshed in the global trading system face higher potential costs for reporting an outbreak because there are more states that can impose barriers in response\u2014and more opportunities for those states to do so. Highly trade-exposed states, then, may choose to delay reporting and try to contain the outbreak themselves first, away from the public eye. Alternatively, if the state is less trade-exposed in the first place, then, all else being equal, it stands to lose less from reporting an outbreak. Another way to get at this relationship is to focus on the value added of the agricultural sector since previous outbreaks have demonstrated that import restrictions during an outbreak often target agricultural products (Cash and Narasimhan 2000, 1362; Johnson 2009). International import restrictions could also spill into the domestic market because consumers tend to seek substitutes for the supposedly affected products even in markets that are not affected by the outbreak, which leads to decreased demand across the board and could further harm international competitiveness (Blayney 2005; Moore and Morgan 2006, 6). Beyond the international costs, harm to domestic agricultural producers could translate into a loss of political support for the government. To avoid or delay this outcome, a government may try to conceal the outbreak.",

If it becomes clear that a country concealed an outbreak, it could face punishment from the international community as well. China's experience during the SARS outbreak is a case in point. The government was publicly criticized by the WHO and other states for concealing the scope of the outbreak, and some officials lost their posts. But, states are shortsighted. The more immediate international costs to worry about are the overreactions of other states once the outbreak is reported. Punishment for concealment comes later, if at all, and would most likely be in the form of rhetorical admonishment rather than immediate material costs. WHO has limited power to enforce reporting requirements and, furthermore, aside from the SARS case, has been reluctant to name and shame states for being slow to report (Kamradt-Scott 2016, 411). In any case, this is an empirical question. If states worry more about the international costs of not reporting than they do about the economic harm of reporting, then we might expect highly trade-exposed states to be more likely to report rather than less likely.",

All governments depend on some level of popular support to stay in office and govern effectively; they take the reaction of the public and other domestic actors into account when making policy.

Either way, governments in high rule-of-law states are more likely to follow through with institutional commitments because not doing so could result in a loss of domestic political support. These states should see outbreak concealment as costly because it undermines a key goal of the IHR, and it would mean disregarding a formal international legal commitment. Importantly, these states should see concealment as particularly costly after the new IHR enter into force because the new regulations strengthen the obligation on states to quickly report outbreaks.",

Kelley (2007) makes a similar institutional effects argument in her study of which states uphold their commitments to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Rule of law actually had a negative influence on the behavior of states that had not ratified.

On its face, then, compliance seems easy to identify. In reality, there is room for subjective interpretation. Though the WHO has the final say on which events constitute a PHEIC, it is less clear which events \u201cmay constitute\u201d a PHEIC and thus require reporting to the WHO. The IHR contain a decision instrument to help states make this determination (World Health Organization 2005, Annex 2). The decision instrument does contain a list of diseases that must always be notified to the WHO, but, this list is not exhaustive. In two other sets of circumstances, states must use an algorithm to determine whether an event should be reported to the WHO. A second list identifies certain diseases that should always lead states to use the algorithm. States should also use the algorithm for \u201cany event of potential international public health concern, including those of unknown causes or sources and those involving other events or diseases\u201d (World Health Organization 2005, Annex 2). Once the decision is made to use the algorithm, states are asked to consider whether the event is serious, unusual, or unexpected, the risk of international spread, and the risk of international trade or travel restrictions being imposed. There is room for interpretation here. Even though the WHO has issued guidance for how to use the decision instrument (World Health Organization 2008), in some cases, it might not be clear whether a failure to report is a case of noncompliance, or just a reasonable difference of opinion about whether the event should have been reported according to the algorithm. Further, it might not be clear when the government actually became aware of the outbreak and when the 24-hour count down should start.",

Though rule of law is negatively associated with reporting in Model 3, when interacted with the IHR entering into force in Model 4, this relationship changes. Before the new IHR enter into force in 2007, a state with a high level of domestic rule of law (third quartile) was 1.36 times less likely to report (hazard ratio of 0.74, p < 0.05) than a state with a low level of domestic rule of law (first quartile), whereas after the IHR entered into force, the substantive effect became quite small (hazard ratio of 0.96) and was no longer significant.11 Although the expectation was that rule of law would encourage reporting and this should have been even more so after the new IHR entered into force, the finding that the negative effect diminishes and is no longer significant post-IHR provides some evidence that the strengthened legal obligation on states to report quickly in the new IHR may have affected the behavior of high rule-of-law states that could suffer costs for not following through international commitments.",

Disease outbreaks can certainly have negative effects on a state's tourism industry. But, crisis management researchers argue that, while tourism losses may be inevitable during and after an outbreak and other natural disasters, government transparency and assurances can increase visitor confidence in the government's handling of the situation and minimize longer term losses (Laws, Prideax, and Chon 2006; Henderson 2007; Beirman 2012). Tourism-reliant countries must weigh the tourism losses that come from rapid reporting against those that come from concealing now with the risk of discovery later. In other words, these governments have to weigh a short-term loss in tourism against a longer term hit to their reputation, which could in turn have a long-term negative impact on tourism. Visitor trust is an important determinant of travel destination selection (see, for example, Jang and Cai 2002; Rahmani, Gnoth, and Mather 2018), and trust is based on individuals\u2019 feelings about a location's reputation (see Artigas et al. 2017). Therefore, it is likely that feelings of distrust could persist after the precipitating event has ended, thus affecting visitor behavior in the longer term (Beirman 2017).",

As such, high-profile events like H1N1 show little benefit to reporting quickly if a country is worried about trade restrictions. Further, the actors primarily responsible for trade losses include industry and other governments rather than the individuals who are primarily responsible for tourism losses. The latter may be more driven by emotions and feelings of trust and comfort whereas the former may be more concerned about the bottom line and so may be less likely to maintain changes in investment or trade behavior after the outbreak has ended, regardless of whether or not a government was transparent at outset (for example, most pork import restrictions during H1N1 were removed after the outbreak dissipated).

As expected, there is a positive interaction between the two. Figure 2 displays the findings graphically (see Model 3 in Table S2 in the supplementary files for full regression results). The figure presents the ratios of simulated hazard rates to compare states with a large tourism sector (third quartile) to those with a small tourism sector (first quartile). While at higher levels of internet coverage, a large tourism sector is associated with faster reporting, at lower levels the substantive relationship is much smaller and no longer statistically significant. Indeed, 25 percent of the outbreaks in the dataset occur in countries with lower internet coverage where the relationship between a large tourism sector and rapid reporting is not significant (the relationship is insignificant at about 0.7 users/1000 population or fewer). These findings are consistent with the argument that governments pay attention to the costs and benefits of reporting. Where the outbreak is more likely to be made public because of strong surveillance capacity, having a large tourism sector encourages governments to transparently report the outbreak rather than risk looking untrustworthy (in contrast and as expected, the negative effect of trade dependence on reporting is not conditional on surveillance capacity). If the cost-benefit analysis shifted in favor of reporting for states other than those with large tourism sectors and strong surveillance capacity, then we could expect more rapid reporting in general.",

For example, the outbreak of Zika in 2016, which is primarily spread through mosquitos and produces only mild symptoms for the vast majority of those infected, provoked few trade or travel barriers. Therefore, in the supplementary files I control for whether, according to the WHO and/or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease spreads through direct human-to-human transmission (see Model 1 in Table S1). Direct human-to-human transmission is negatively correlated with reporting, but the relationship is not statistically significant. I also include a binary variable for whether the country experienced an outbreak previously in the dataset, which is not significantly associated with reporting (Model 2 in Table S1). Importantly, controlling for these factors does not alter the substantive findings presented in Section 6.",

Because health spending measures the amount of money spent rather than how it is spent, it may not accurately capture surveillance capacity. This is why I include internet coverage in the analysis. Though internet coverage gets at communication networks and a possible pathway for surveillance, it is a noisy indicator. The extent of internet coverage could be a product of how transparent the state is generally\u2014a government that is transparent and likely to report outbreaks may also be likely to have wide internet coverage. Or, in some cases, internet coverage may not actually reflect surveillance capacity, but instead could reflect the likelihood that nonstate actors might make an outbreak public and hold a government accountable for not reporting itself. Therefore, in the supplementary files, I exclude internet coverage and use only health spending as a measure of surveillance capacity.

In short, in addition to the issue of weak capacity, governments also face a potential wide range of costs when deciding to report outbreaks in a timely manner. Thus, it is important that the WHO has recently emphasized outbreak preparedness and response as one of three strategic priority areas for 2019\u20132023 (World Health Organization 2018a, 20). Further, the Sustainable Development Goals explicitly include meeting the IHR outbreak response capacities as an indicator under target 3.D, which aims to promote global health security (United Nations 2017).

First, effectively discouraging the imposition of trade and travel barriers that go against WHO guidance during an outbreak could reduce the anticipated costs of reporting. That so many countries have imposed excessive barriers during recent global health emergencies, with little consequence for ignoring WHO guidelines, suggests that convincing states not to do so is no easy task. The WHO, NGOs, and/or other states must at least threaten reputational costs for this behavior that goes against state commitments to the IHR. On paper, the WHO has the authority to name and shame states that disregard its recommendations, but it has not exercised this authority during recent outbreaks (Kamradt-Scott 2016, 411). This caution is not surprising given the WHO's continued reliance on member countries for financial support and cooperation, but it is a missed opportunity to lower the costs of outbreak reporting. States and interested NGOs could fill the gap, but both have their own reasons for not wanting to name and shame countries for bad behavior. In its five-year strategic plan to improve public health preparedness and response presented at the World Health Assembly in May 2018, WHO emphasized that the organization should systematically collect and report on additional health measures imposed by states and coordinate with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address trade-related issues during public health emergencies of international concern (World Health Organization 2018b, 8\u20139). Further, WHO (with the University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia), recently launched a new tool to monitor state compliance with IHR requirements regarding additional health measures (Kamradt-Scott et al. 2018). These are important, and positive, developments. But, it remains to be seen how the tool will be used during a public health emergency. The structural constraints that have made WHO hesitant to criticize, let alone directly oppose, its member countries remain\u2014and may actually intensify over time given the increasing role of voluntary contributions in the organization's budget (Graham 2017).",

In the absence of anticipated costs for disregarding WHO guidance during an outbreak, the declaration of a public health emergency signals that a serious outbreak is underway and that states should go ahead and impose restrictive border measures. This relationship may actually explain my finding that the new IHR have not had an overall positive influence on the timeliness of reporting. If states that discover outbreaks know, or think, that the WHO's formal declaration of a public health emergency might actually provoke barriers, then they will not be eager to report post-IHR. Naming and shaming states that ignore WHO guidance by imposing barriers could disrupt this dynamic.",

The World Bank recently launched the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility in order to make funds available to poorly resourced countries at the start of an outbreak to help with rapid response (Stein and Sridhar 2017). There have been some implementation issues with the fund, but a mechanism should also be set up to compensate for economic losses during outbreaks. Providing some assurance of financial compensation might convince governments to report and risk the associated economic costs. This type of mechanism has been suggested before (Cash and Narasimhan 2000, 1365) and was even supported by some states during negotiations of the revised IHR in 2004 (World Health Organization 2004, 2), yet it has neither been implemented nor seriously discussed as a policy option since then.",

Disincentives to reporting also exist at the local level during an outbreak, which can then delay reporting at the national level. For example, underreporting of cases of avian flu among poultry has been suspected in China due to insufficient compensation for the culling of birds after an outbreak is made public (Kaufman 2008, S11; Huang, Wang, and Zuo 2017, 67). The United Nations recommends compensation to encourage local reporting of avian influenza, and it has been implemented with some success in some cases of disease outbreaks among livestock and poultry, including the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain (Donaldson et al. 2006; UNSIC Office 2017). Incentives for concealment at the local level exist during outbreaks that affect humans as well. Local officials and family members may conceal cases because of the sometimes draconian public health measures that are adopted in response. For example, Liberia's West Point neighborhood in the capital Monrovia was sealed off by the government during the Ebola outbreak and the community was isolated from needed food and other supplies (Onishi 2014). Short of official quarantine, local reporting may have other economic repercussions as well if people and businesses avoid affected areas.",

Of course, financial compensation must be set at a level that is high enough to encourage reporting but not so high that it creates a moral hazard. In the case of avian influenza, the United Nations recommends that rates be \u201cno less than 50 percent of the reference market value of suspected birds at the farm gate, and no more than 100 percent\u201d (UNSIC Office 2017).

But, this is often difficult to ascertain in real time, and, as discussed above, criticizing member countries does not come easily to the organization. A more promising strategy would be to incorporate domestic legal protections for nonstate actors that independently report outbreaks into the IHR core capacity requirements. Currently, the WHO can use outbreak information from nonstate sources without state permission, but in certain scenarios these actors may be hesitant to report such information without state sign-off. Stronger legal protections could empower nonstate actors to share information and therefore raise reputational costs for governments that do not cooperate.",

Quality and detailed data on outbreaks are critical for fully understanding reporting lags and other aspects of outbreak response. Existing data illustrate that we need to engage in a more concerted and sophisticated global data collection effort. As noted above, about 25 percent of the outbreaks verified by the WHO are missing information on the start date; it could be that the outbreaks with start date information occur in countries that, on average, have higher surveillance capacity. Other possibilities exist as well, including that certain types of diseases may be harder to surveil and thus may be less likely to have a recorded start date. Furthermore, the outbreaks verified by the WHO only represent a subset of outbreaks that actually occur. Therefore, as others have emphasized (see, for example, Smolinski, Crawley, and Olsen 2017), more comprehensive outbreak data collection efforts are needed in order to further investigate, and improve, trends in outbreak reporting. Though such efforts will not necessarily help to fill in historical outbreak records, improving data collection now can help us to derive better lessons from future outbreaks.",
