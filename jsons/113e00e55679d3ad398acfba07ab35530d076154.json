Moreover, these models also exhibit many features characteristic of this epidemic: a small fraction of individuals show a very great propensity to infect others (the \"super-spreaders\"); and, propagation of the virus For the purpose of comparison, the numbers on the lower plot are normalised by the maximum daily infection tally.

The parameters r and a are the infection rate and the removal rate respectively. Using the SIR data we obtain a maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. minimum least squares fit) of the parameters a and r for the Hong Kong SARS time series. The time series in Fig. 1 is the number of new infections reported each day. This corresponds to the term rS t I t in Eqn. (1) . The numerical fitting procedure often estimates (incorrectly) a monotonically increasing of decreasing function. To prevent these solutions, we add leading and trailing zeros to the data prior to fitting. This helps to ensure that the optimal model exhibits a single extremum -not at either endpoint. An alternative to fitting rS t I t to the observed data would be to also consider the daily fatality and recovery data for Hong Kong as an approximation for \u2206R t .

For the model described by Eqn. (2) we generate 1000 simulations and for each simulation compute < x t x t+1 > and < z t z t+1 > where z t = log xt xt+1 . That is, we use two distinct test statistics. Results for both \u2020 See [12] for a description of this rather exclusive nomenclature. Informally this means we do not force the surrogates to preserve specific properties of the data. This means that we are unable to reject all SIR models with this test, only the SIR models that are fit to this data. statistics are plotted in Fig. 5 show a clear distinction between data and surrogates. Since this model is the optimal fit to the data and the distribution of covariance estimates do not vary greatly with change in model parameters \u2020 \u2020 , we therefore conclude that models of the form Eqn.

This good agreement is due to a combination of long range correlation present in the model data and the same \"burstiness\" that is also observed in the true data. In Fig. 7 we see that both model and simulations exhibit similar large spikes when one (or several) so-called \"super-spreaders\" are encountered at random. However, this model is not entirely satisfactory. The disease epidemic is controlled artificial by suitable selection of p 1,2 (t). Furthermore, no nodes ever become \"removed\". To remedy this we set p 1 (t) = p 1 = 0.05, p 2 (t) = p 2 = 0.005, and r 1 = 0.1. These values are selected after a process of trial and error, but do roughly correspond to the experience of SARS in Hong Kong. The probability p 1 is the daily probability of infected close family members or neighbours, p 2 is the daily probability of infecting more casual acquaintances. Finally, we allow for an exponential distribution of the number of neighbours with an expected value of 6. Hence the system truly is a scale free network and the existence of \"super-spreaders\" is explicitly modelled by this random variable.",

            "text": "The time series produced by this simulation are similar to those of the restricted SWN in Fig. 7 . The major differences are the inclusion of the removed category and that the infection probabilities do not change with time. A constant value for p 1,2 may not be entirely realistic, but is is a statistical necessity to avoid over-fitting in such a complex stochastic model. A consequence of these constant values of p 1,2 is that often the disease will \"die-out\" immediately, or, it will run out of control and infect the entire community. In simulations, both situations are common, but so to is the eventual control of the epidemic: without changing the infection control policy! We do not show typical trajectories of this final model because they are similar to those shown in Fig.  7 , only with a slightly larger variability. In Fig. 8 we generate 1000 simulations of length greater than 90 (i.e. simulations that immediately die out are rejected) but no longer than 120 (longer simulations were truncated) of this SWN system (n 1 = 4, E(n 2 ) = 10, p 1 = 0.25, p 2 = 0.001, and r 1 = 0.45) \u2020 and compare the covariance of \u2206S t to the true data. In each case we are unable to reject the underlying SWN model. A slight increase in variability (when compared to the previous model with artificially variable p 1,2 ) is observed in this second structure and we believe that this is due to the lower level of \"control\" on the parameter values and the inclusion of both simulations that die out, and those that run out of control in the analysis. \u2020 Simulations were repeated with a variety of other values and a wide variety of dynamics behaviour. Most notably the parameter values n1 = 4, E(n2) = 6, p1 = 0.05, p2 = 0.005, and r1 = 0.1 produced surrogate results similar to those in Fig. 8 . These two sets of parameter values where selected as they reflected the authors' understandings of the physical environment.",

            "text": "The daily reported SARS figures for Hong Kong have been considered. We find that the data is not consistent with a random walk or a noisy version of the standard SIR model. However, two SWN structures do exhibit dynamics indistinguishable from the true data. To accurately simulate the spread of disease in society, including features observed during the SARS epidemic (such as rapid, extensive and localised outbreaks), one needs to consider complex SWN type structures. The power of the SIR model lies in its ability to model large scale spread of a contagion, the SWN structure described here is much better at simulating the localised variability. This localised variability, inherent to the model simulations may allow administrators and forecasters to estimate possible variation in their predictions of disease dynamics (i.e. to provide error bars on their projections and evaluate the likelihood of various scenarios). Such techniques are certain to be useful when planning and implementing control strategies. In a related publication, we provide a more detailed analysis of the potential scale-free structure of various SWN models [13] . Furthermore, in this paper we propose the variable parameter SWN model is actually inspired by governmental public health practice [13] . In this current we our primary goal is to show that SWN models are able to capture the underlying dynamics of the SARS epidemic better than either simple stochastic or SIR models.",
