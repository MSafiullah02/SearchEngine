            "text": "Successful management of infections in kidney transplant recipients is complicated by factors related to the immune status of the host and the epidemiology of infection.57 Transplant recipients are susceptible to a broad spectrum of infectious pathogens while manifesting diminished signs and symptoms of invasive infection. Thus, the diagnosis of infection is more difficult in transplantation than in immunologically normal individuals. The interactions between infection, immunosuppression, and immune function play out in a complex environment in which multiple simultaneous processes, such as infection and graft rejection, may contribute to the clinical presentation. Immunocompromised patients tolerate invasive, established infection poorly with high morbidity and mortality, lending urgency to the need for an early, specific diagnosis to guide antimicrobial therapy. Given the T-lymphocyte dysfunction inherent to transplant immunosuppression, viral infections in particular are increased. These viral infections not only contribute to graft dysfunction, graft rejection, and systemic illness but also enhance the risk for other opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis and Aspergillus) and virally mediated cancers.",

Bacteremic or fungemic infections (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species, Gram-negative bacteria) in donors at the time of donation can cause local (abscess) or systemic (bacteremic) infections, and may selectively adhere to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary) to produce leaks or mycotic aneurysms. Some viral infections are ubiquitous, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), and are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population (see section on selected infections of importance). The greatest risk of these infections is to seronegative (immunologically na\u00efve) recipients who receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (latent viral infection). Some viruses demonstrate accelerated progression (lymphocytic choriomeningitis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), rabies) in transplant recipients. Latent infections, such as tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, or strongyloidiasis, may activate from grafts many years after the initial, often unrecognized exposures.",

As a result, some active infections remain undetected because seroconversion may not occur during acute infection. These limitations suggest that, to achieve the benefits of transplantation, some organs are implanted carrying unidentified pathogens. This risk is exhibited by clusters of donor-derived Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas\u2019 disease), rabies virus, West Nile virus, and LCMV infections in organ transplant recipients. Molecular assays for donor screening (e.g., for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV)) have the capacity to reduce the \u201cwindow period\u201d between exposure and development of a positive microbiological assay (nucleic acid test (NAT) instead of seroconversion) with some risk for false-positive assays given heightened NAT sensitivity.",

Community (contact or transfusion-associated) exposure to CMV and EBV may produce severe primary infection in the non-immune host. Recent and remote exposures to endemic, geographically restricted systemic mycoses (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in localized pulmonary, systemic, or metastatic infection. Asymptomatic Strongyloides stercoralis infection may activate more than 30 years after initial exposure due to immunosuppressive therapy (Figure 31-1). Such reactivation can result in either a diarrheal illness and parasite migration with hyperinfestation syndrome (characterized by hemorrhagic enterocolitis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, or both) or disseminated infection with accompanying (usually) Gram-negative bacteremia or meningitis.

These include: successful use of prophylaxis or monitoring programs against CMV and the herpesviruses, against Pneumocystis and urinary tract infections, and for HBV; and intensification of immunosuppression using more potent agents or antibody-based therapies with prolonged effects on immune function (Table 31-6). Infection in the transplant recipient 1\u201312 months after transplantation has one of three causes:1.Infection from the perisurgical period, including relapsed C. difficile colitis, inadequately treated pneumonia, or infection related to a technical problem (e.g., a urine leak, lymphocele, ureteric stricture, hematoma). Fluid collections in this setting generally require drainage.2.Viral infections including CMV, HSV, shingles (VZV), human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 or HHV-7, EBV, hepatitis (HBV, HCV), and HIV. This group of viruses is unique. These infections are lifelong and tissue-associated, and are often transmitted with the allograft from seropositive donors. These viruses are systemically immunosuppressive, predisposing to opportunistic infection or acceleration of other infections (HCV) and predispose to graft rejection. The herpesviruses are prominent given the importance of T-cell function in antiviral control and the disproportionate degree of T-cell inhibition by most immunosuppressive regimens. Other common viral pathogens of this period include BK polyomavirus (in association with allograft dysfunction or polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN)) and community-acquired respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus). Superinfection of virally infected hosts is common.3.Opportunistic infections secondary to Pneumocystis jiroveci, Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, Nocardia, Aspergillus, and other agents.In this period, the stage also is set for the emergence of a subgroup of patients \u2013 the \u201cchronic ne\u2019er do well\u201d \u2013 the patient who requires higher than average immunosuppression to maintain graft function or who has prolonged, untreated viral infections and other opportunistic infections, which predict long-term susceptibility to other infections (third phase, discussed below).

These patients resemble the general community in terms of infection risk, with community-acquired respiratory viruses constituting their major risk. Occasionally, such patients develop primary CMV infection (socially acquired) or infections related to underlying diseases (e.g., skin infections in diabetes). A second group of patients has chronic viral infection, which may produce end-organ damage (e.g., BK polyomavirus leading to fibrosis, HCV leading to cryoglobulinemia and cirrhosis, CMV with chronic graft rejection) or malignancy (e.g., posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) secondary to EBV, skin or anogenital cancer related to papillomaviruses).

A useful organ must be procured and implanted before some microbiologic assessments have been completed. Major infections must be excluded, and appropriate cultures and samples must be obtained for future reference. As a result, bacteremia or fungemia may not be detected until after the transplantation has been performed. Such infections generally have not resulted in transmission of infection as long as the infection has been adequately treated in terms of use of antimicrobial agents to which the organism is susceptible and time. In recipients of tissues from 95 bacteremic donors, a mean of 3.8 days of effective therapy after transplantation seemed adequate to prevent transmission of susceptible pathogens. Longer courses of therapy in the recipient are preferred, targeting known donor-derived pathogens.17\n,\n26 Bacterial meningitis must be treated with antibiotics that penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid before organ procurement. Individuals with unidentified and untreated causes of meningoencephalitis or sepsis should not be used as organ donors. Donor-derived infections due to Candida species have resulted from contamination or candidemia at the time of procurement.57\n,\n58 These require susceptibility testing of the isolate and prolonged treatment (2\u20134 weeks) with effective agents to avoid pyelonephritis, abscess formation, mycotic aneurysm, or fungemia in the recipient. Vascular involvement by Candida species in the recipient requires at least 6 weeks of therapy. Certain acute infections (CMV, HSV, EBV, HIV, and HCV) may be undetected in the period before antibody formation. Viral nucleic acid detection assays are preferred for sensitivity. Likewise, the donor\u2019s clinical, social, and medical histories are essential to reducing the risk of such infections. In the presence of known infection, such infections must be treated before procurement if possible. Several more recent clusters of donor-derived infection have shown the risk for infection secondary to previously unrecognized pathogens, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Chagas\u2019 disease, and HSV, in addition to other, more common pathogens. Major exclusion criteria are outlined in Table 31-2.",

The central role of assays is illustrated by the approach to the management of CMV risk (Table 31-6). The schedule for screening is linked to the risk for infection. In the high-risk patient (D+/R+ or R+ with antilymphocyte globulin), after the completion of prophylaxis, monthly screening is performed to ensure the absence of infection for 3\u20136 months. In the patient being treated for CMV infection, the assays provide an end-point for therapy and the initiation of prophylaxis.",

Universal prophylaxis involves giving antiviral therapy to all at-risk patients beginning at or immediately after transplantation for a defined period. In pre-emptive therapy, quantitative assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals (generally weekly for weeks 1\u201312) to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Pre-emptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care, while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of not only preventing CMV infection during the period of greatest risk but also diminishing infections secondary to HHV-6, HHV-7, and EBV. The indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, opportunistic infection) also may be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither universal prophylaxis nor pre-emptive therapy is perfect. Many centers use a combination of both approaches: universal prophylaxis for the highest-risk recipients (D+/R\u2013 and R+ with T-cell depletion), and pre-emptive therapy for others. Infrequently, breakthrough disease and ganciclovir resistance have been observed with both approaches.1\n",

Combined mutations (UL97 and UL54) may manifest high-level resistance to ganciclovir. Alternative therapies are available in intravenous form only. These include foscarnet and cidofovir. Foscarnet is active against many ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV, although associated with marked magnesium and potassium wasting, seizures (notably with calcineurin inhibitor therapy), and some renal toxicity. Cidofovir may also be used, but often incurs significant nephrotoxicity and ocular toxicity. Liposomal cidofovir is under investigation. UL54 mutations may cause resistance to foscarnet and to cidofovir depending on the nature of the mutation. Multiple courses of antiviral therapy may be needed to cure resistant CMV infection. Given the toxicity of available medications, several investigational drugs are under study that may alter recommended therapies for antiviral-resistant CMV. Combination therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet) may be useful, as is the addition of hyperimmune globulins. Most centers try to reduce overall immunosuppression during the course of therapy.

Upper tract disease with Candida species should suggest obstruction and requires more intensive therapy (fluconazole 400 mg daily for 3\u20134 weeks). The echinocandins are not useful for the treatment of most urinary tract infections as they achieve poor concentrations in the urinary tract. Removal of stents and catheters is generally required for resolution of urinary tract infection.",

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole given for 6 months to 1 year post kidney transplantation is generally effective in the absence of instrumentation or obstruction. Few recent studies address whether the changing ecology of bacteria have reduced the efficacy of prophylaxis. In patients intolerant of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a fluoroquinolone may be used with the addition of another agent against PCP (atovaquone, dapsone).",
