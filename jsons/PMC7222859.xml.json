OI caused approximately 5600 job-related deaths and 8.5 million non-fatal injuries in 2007, although incidence has been declining [2\u20134]. In 2016, that number decreased to 5190 and 2.86 million, respectively [4]. However, accurate epidemiological data on OI are difficult to obtain due to various reporting modalities and incentives [5]. A capture\u2013recapture analysis looking into OI incidence in Michigan found that up to 68% of injuries were not accounted for with the current surveillance systems [6]. Similarly, another capture\u2013recapture analysis found non-fatal OI was reported in less than 50% of cases [7]. These underestimates indicate that less resources were allocated to preventing and addressing OIs than what is needed [5].",

Furthermore, the mechanisms of injury associated with OI to GU organs are unknown. Given the relative frequency of OI and the susceptibility of GU organs to traumatic injury, we sought to determine the most common GU organs injured following an OI, as well as the mechanism of injury, and compare the impact of GU injury in an occupational setting (GU OI) with GU injuries in a non-occupational setting (GU non-OI) on cost, morbidity, and mortality.",

The local costing system included all patients discharged before July 1, 2016; the national costing system included all patients discharged on July 1, 2016 or later. Using the local costing system, direct cost data on labor were collected using relative value units (RVUs) for surgical minutes, therapy, imaging, and the emergency department (ED); a ratio of cost to charge (RCC) method was used to calculate labor cost in pharmacy. Data on supply items for pharmacy, surgery, and contrast for imaging were collected using the RCC method. Direct cost data for all other expenses related to therapy, imaging and the ED were collected using RVUs. Using the national costing system, cost of labor for therapy, imaging, and the ED were collected by matching CPT codes to RVUs; to calculate cost for pharmacy, CPT codes were used to weigh labor needed to dispense medications based on the delivery method with RCC. Supply items and additional expenses for pharmacy, surgery, therapy, imaging, and the ED were matched to invoices and calculated with the RCC method. Cost data in nursing units and lab-related departments were collected from both systems using RVUs based on the CPT code of the charge for labor and RCC for all other expenses. Overhead cost was calculated using drivers, which allowed for individual allocation based on RCC; drivers included patient revenue, patient days, expense, and square footage. Both costing systems used a year to date cost; the local system was based on discharge date and the national system was based on posting date. Direct cost data included the ED and inpatient stay; the cost of follow-up and outpatient care was excluded as our database only captured inpatient costs.",

Conversely, a large prospective study in Taiwan found that 77/9252 (0.83%) patients with blunt abdominal trauma had an adrenal injury, with 59/77 (77%) and 16/77 (20.8%) of injuries occurring on the right and left sides, respectively [10]. Their cohort had a similar mean ISS (25.4 \u00b1 13.4), implying that injury severity did not impact the adrenal trauma incidence rate discrepancy. It is possible that the high rate in our cohort is due to ICD coding bias captured solely based on imaging or intraoperative findings. It is worth noting that GU OI patients in our study had a significantly higher incidence of adrenal trauma than GU non-OI patients, although this may be related to a small sample size as opposed to a true difference. However, it is also possible that patients with OI had higher velocity or higher impact injuries than non-OI. Additionally, the laterality of injury seen in our study aligns with previous findings with higher rates of injury to the right adrenal gland. This suggests underlying factors that favor right-sided injury such as shorter, more vulnerable adrenal vein to the vena cava.",

In their study, most OIs occurred in men (86.6%; N = 19,532). The authors found that the most common causes of injury were falls (34.8%, N = 7845), machinery (18.1%, N = 4088), and motor vehicle crashes (11.2%, N = 2532). While the authors did not note specific organs injured, they did report an internal injury rate of 15.4% (N = 3462). Injured workers were hospitalized for 3.6 days (SD = 7.5), stayed in the ICU for 0.7 (SD = 3.4), and required ventilator support for 0.3 days (SD = 2.4). There are some similarities with our findings in which patients suffering from an OI were more likely to be male and suffer from a fall. However, we found a higher ISS among GU OI patients, longer hospital stays, longer ICU stays and required ventilator support. The higher ISS of our cohort likely contributed to the increased duration of hospitalization, ICU days, and ventilator support. Because our patients who experienced GU non-OI also had higher ISS than those in the study by Friedman et al., the differences in care required are more likely due to higher acuity and not due to higher severity in GU OI specifically.",

Because the occurrence of injury must be directly related to performance of occupational duty to be eligible for this benefit, it is unsurprising that our study found a lower rate of utilization of WC amongst the GU non-OI group when compared to the GU OI group [12]. In other words, patients meeting the USDOL eligibility for WC were injured at work, leading to nearly exclusive classification into our GU OI group, thus creating a significant difference between groups. Laws regarding WC are on a state-by-state basis, with every state except Texas requiring an employer to offer coverage [13]. Biddle et al. analyzed the percentage of workers in Michigan who utilized WC after an OI. They found overall low rates of utilization ranging from 10 to 45% of eligible workers, with slightly higher rates among women [14]. Another study conducted by the CDC investigated use of WC in ten different states and found higher utilization rates, ranging from 47% (Texas) to 77% (Kentucky) [15]. Despite all cases in our study occurring in Texas, we still found a higher utilization of WC among those with GU OIs when compared to expected rates. Because the study by Biddle et al. did not account for injury severity, it is possible that their lower rates of utilization are due in part to lower reporting among less severe conditions, such as muscle sprains, and the higher rates we found were biased by traumatic injuries with higher acuity. However, it is also possible that patients who experience a GU OI have a higher rate of utilization of WC than other types of OI. A possible explanation is that GU OI patients, when compared with those who experience OI without GU injury, are more likely to experience polytrauma and greater injury severity and are thus more likely to require disability compensation [16].",

While we only looked at inpatient and direct cost, Baker et al. speculate that most of the difference arises in indirect cost. However, most patients in our cohort were discharged home, with fewer patients requiring rehabilitation or admission to a skilled nursing facility, suggesting less cost to the healthcare system. Nevertheless, this does not account for the lost productivity after discharge, which could also be factored into indirect cost and is an area among GU OI patients that could be further explored.",
