            "text": "COVID-19 is the disease cause by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. 2 Radiographers, patient facing, frontline health professionals, have a key role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs. 3 However, sensitivity is variable reported to be 70%e90% on initial swab 4 and 90% on second swab at 72 h. 5 The British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) have developed a clinical decision support tool to aid clinicians, radiographers and radiologists when managing patients where COVID-19 is within the differential diagnosis e the chest radiograph (CXR) forms the bedrock of this tool. 6 CXRs are a key diagnostic test when investigating patients with respiratory symptoms and are advocated as the first imaging examination in patients with suspected COVID-19. Mobile CXRs are an important diagnostic test in the evaluation of critically unwell patients, and in particular will have a role in minimising the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 associated with patient transfer. Baseline CXRs have a reported sensitivity of 69% compared to baseline RT-PCR thus far, but analysis has been lacking due to puzzlingly limited use of CXR in the outbreak to date. 4 Preliminary clinical evaluation (PCE) by radiographers at time of image acquisition is an expected competency of practitioners in many regions including the United Kingdom 7 and Australia. 8 As radiographers are almost invariably the first practitioner to see the diagnostic image, it follows that radiographer PCE and triage for an immediate clinical report plays a vital role in identifying possible COVID-19 patients. There are increasing case reports of patients presenting to hospital without classical symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough), including abdominal symptoms, 9, 10 and may be referred for non-COVID diagnostic workup without respiratory precautions in place. Rapid radiographer PCE and triage will facilitate prompt reporting of the investigation, aid patient diagnosis and management decisions in a timely way. This rapid triage also allows for the potential of all imaging to be performed during a single hospital attendance and, more crucially, immediate appropriate decontamination of imaging equipment.",
