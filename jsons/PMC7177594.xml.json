In the past two decades, at least three novel human-pathogenic coronaviruses have crossed species barriers to cause major epidemics. These included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2,3,4]. Emerging in late 2019, the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated rapidly around the globe and has been declared a pandemic [5,6]. By 27 March 2020, 465,915 confirmed cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 200 countries or territories, with 21,031 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). The case fatality rate estimate ranged from about 1% in resource-rich settings, to up to 12% in epicentres [6]. Multiple clinical trials evaluating known and novel pharmacological agents have been in progress [7,8,9,10], and innovative epidemiological modelling and mechanistic exploratory studies have also been made available [11,12,13,14]; at the time of writing, there is no effective antiviral therapy of proven clinical benefit.",

Various groups have made publicly available broadly-specific assays that target pan-coronaviruses, various members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus, or modified assays with specific oligonucleotide probes to achieve SARS-CoV-2 discrimination (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance). With the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the culprit viral species, a highly-specific assay, without cross-reactivity to closely-related viruses infecting humans such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [21] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [22], is needed.",

With the identified targets, primers were designed and optimized for a highly sensitive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, eventually without the additional use of fluorescent reporter probes. The optimized assay was then evaluated on a variety of patient specimens. Finally, the potential application and significance of the newly-developed assay, as well as the known limitations, were discussed.",

A major novelty of the current approach was the application of genome subtraction to deduce a previously untargeted region of the viral genome encoding nsp2 and subsequent adoption in a diagnostic assay. To our knowledge, no SARS-CoV-2 assay targeting the nsp2 coding region has been published previously. The current nsp2 assay was highly specific (without cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses) and comparable to the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay in terms of analytical sensitivity. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the nsp2 assay was 100% in comparison with the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay in this study. The reproducibility, in terms of Cp values, was satisfactory with both intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation values well below the 5% cutoff specified in literature [28,29]. Furthermore, the PCR reaction time of the nsp2 assay was within an hour, which is shorter than that of the previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay [24]; this is a distinct advantage in clinical laboratories, as rapid results can facilitate the timely triage of suspected COVID-19 cases and guide infection control and patient management. In terms of functional significance, the nsp2 region highlighted by genome subtraction corroborated with a recent modeling study which suggested that positively selected regions within the nsp2 protein could contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus [30].",

While antibody-based testing has been developed [31] and even made commercially available as point-of-care testing kits [32], they lack sensitivity in detecting early infection before the host has successfully mounted a humoral response [33], cannot be applied to certain specimen types (such as urine [19], as antibodies cannot be secreted into the glomerular filtrate unless the patient develops severe renal damage) and cannot be used to determine when the host ceases to become infectious [34]. As nucleic acid amplification-based testing allows exquisite sensitivity (1.8 TCID50/mL in our case) and can be readily adopted in laboratories with basic molecular facilities, it is an essential tool in the clinical management and triage of patients. The robust design of the optimized assay, requiring only one pair of SARS-CoV-2-specific primers to diagnose COVID-19 infection in humans, avoids the potential logistics, reagent and manpower constraints in performing multiple or cascade testing or the use of relatively costly reporter probes. In developed countries where medical resources have become critically limited [35,36], it is believed that this new assay may be adopted to allow for the testing of more patients in a shorter time.",

As SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, which typically has a relatively high mutation rate (10\u22124 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for coronaviruses [37]), this is a distinct possibility that must be considered. However, with the use of less-specific assays, such as pan-coronavirus primers [38], the diagnostic laboratory can adopt a two-tier approach by first attempting to confirm infection using the new nsp2 assay, and subsequently use the broadly-specific assays on clinically suspicious cases to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, GolayMetaMiner is available as a free and open-source software that can be applied efficiently to newly deduced mutant sequences. Using the software tool, degenerate bases may be strategically incorporated into the COVID-19-nsp2 assay primers to broaden the specificity, or additional targets may be iteratively identified from further coronavirus pan-genome analyses.",

The GolayMetaMiner software first downloads the genomes of the target and non-target species from the NCBI nucleotide database and generates a pool of nucleotide k-mers (k = 12 by default) for both forward and reverse directions of the non-target genomes. Next, the program steps through the forward strand of the target genome (--primary_target) and assign a binary uniqueness value of either 1 (k-mer is unique to the target genome) or 0 (k-mer is found in the non-target pool). As a pathogen detection assay needs to account for potential genomic variability of the target pathogen, the GolayMetaMiner software then steps through the target genome to determine if the k-mer is also present in other intended targets (--secondary_targets or --secondary_target_list), adding a value of 1 (k-mer is present in a secondary target genome) or 0 (k-mer is absent in a secondary genome). The conservedness value is normalized to a maximum value of 1 by dividing this absent/present count by the total number of secondary target genomes. Before plotting the scores, the arrays of uniqueness and conservedness values are smoothed using an empirically optimized Savitzky\u2013Golay filter (window size = 501, polynomial order = 3) and transformed to continuous scores (U-score, C-score), and a U-score cutoff is calculated according to a specified percentile cutoff (defaults to 99.99th).",

The longer of the two SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced by our group [23], HKU-SZ-005b, was used as the reference genome (--primary_target MN975262), and a list of accession numbers of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were used as secondary targets (--secondary_target_list SARS-CoV-2_genomes.txt); the accession number of the reference genome was manually commented out with a \u201c#\u201d to avoid double-counting the reference genome in estimating conservedness. Non-targets were specified by downloading a table of complete Coronaviridae genomes from the NCBI genome browser (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/viruses/) and passed to the program as a CSV file (--non_target_ncbi_table coronaviridae_complete.csv). An exclusion string was added to exclude entries marked as SARS-CoV-2 from the genome table (--exclusion_string \u201cSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d). The genome U-score cutoff was empirically determined: if the default setting of 99.99th percentile could not yield any potential target, it would be progressively relaxed to 99.9th, 99th, 98th etc. As genome data could be automatically downloaded when the GolayMetaMiner was executed, no genome data was included with the software distribution to respect the rights of certain sequence owners. The lists of accession numbers of the 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes are available in Supplementary Materials.

For analytical sensitivity evaluation, TNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2 isolate was used. For analytical specificity evaluation, a clinical respiratory specimen of HCoV-HKU1 and 17 culture isolates of other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses were used [24]. For assay performance evaluation, 59 archived clinical specimens (26 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab, throat swab, endotracheal aspirate, sputum and saliva, and 33 non-respiratory specimens including plasma, urine, rectal swab/stool) from 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were used [24]. These specimens were evaluated previously using the established COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay [24].
