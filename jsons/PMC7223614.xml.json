Next, we identified relations between the initial codes and grouped them into categories according to their similarity. Lastly, these categories were organized into themes and subthemes. This inductive process (starting from the observation rather than from preexisting theories) was performed independently by three researchers with different backgrounds (an anthropologist, a psychiatrist, and a surgeon) so that we could triangulate our different perspectives and attend systematically to our own effects as researchers at each step of the process [15]. Consensus was reached during study meetings. We used NVIVO software (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) during the process of analysis.",

The underlying presence of this threat may alter the physician\u2019s career satisfaction and lead to serious psychological symptoms. Doctors who have received few or no complaints also report the same potential threat of litigation, which contributes to growing professional frustration [13]. This perceived risk is a significant stressor that can lead to compassion fatigue, directly correlated to reduced empathy toward patients. Clinical performance and the doctor-patient relationship are affected. Data suggested that accelerated burnout and depression re-occur in a vicious circle leading to worsening patient care and higher risk of adverse events [1]. Surgeons are often in an isolated position in the face of their chronic professional suffering: Even if recent steps, within institutions and via insurance companies, have been proposed to prevent and support practitioners in this kind of situation, there is still a long way to go in a profession marked by the culture of individualism and by a relationship of distrust with the administrations [23, 26].",

Elements of law and medicolegal strategies should be better integrated from primary education onwards to prevent rather than cure, as well as in continuing education. Practicing in a group, sharing experiences and cases, and cases and taking part in morbidity boards are a major help in avoiding unfavorable decisions and defensive practices. Support groups should intervene to prevent a surgeon from being isolated in the event of litigation, whether they are responsible or not [10]. The doctor-patient relationship must remain at the center of our efforts, but unfortunately the busy schedule of private medicine is sometimes incompatible with the availability that each patient requires [25].",
