Many patients have no prior liver evaluation, and it remains uncertain if they have a primary hepatic condition or the liver enzymes are elevated in association with COVID-19 infection or due to druginduced liver injury. Some providers may instinctively evaluate these abnormal enzymes with a hepatobiliary ultrasound, but this could place radiology technicians at unnecessary risk for COVID-19 exposure and use stores of valuable personal protective equipment (PPE). Similarly, hepatitis B or C viral PCRs could be performed, which, depending on the hospital's COVID-19 testing strategy, could impede the hospital's ability to run COVID-19 PCRs. We have found it valuable to review specific COVID-19 cases with our hepatology group and create uniform, yet dynamic, guidance around how to evaluate (or defer evaluation) of abnormal liver enzymes during the pandemic. We have also developed an efficient e-consultation service with a templated and evolving note, which facilitates rapid feedback to infec-tious disease specialists and medicine colleagues and spares PPE utilization while limiting patient-physician exposure. Many of these patients can defer detailed liver evaluation during the pandemic.",

Liver transplant management: The COVID-19 pandemic will influence liver transplantation in numerous ways. Liver transplant providers will be increasingly at risk of exposure and infection with COVID-19, through ongoing interaction with the health care system.
