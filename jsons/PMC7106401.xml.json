Adults have between two and four colds per year, whereas children have between six and ten colds.1 Although rhinovirus and coronavirus are the most common viruses precipitating cold symptoms, approximately 200 other viruses are also known to cause the common cold. In the USA, about 40% of lost work time and 30% of time lost from school are attributed to symptoms caused by the common cold.2 The common cold is also associated with a large financial burden on society, with about US$1\u00b75 billion spent annually for physicians' visits and another $2 billion spent on non-prescription cough and cold treatments.3\n",

Some evidence suggests that upregulation of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA, which is stimulated by agonistic activity of the cannabinoid receptor (CB2) by alkamides present in echinacea, has a role.7\n",

Meta-analysis can be useful in situations such as this, since it can show what the preponderance of evidence in the published work suggests. A past systematic review by Melchart and colleagues13 concluded that echinacea preparations from the aerial part of the plant were effective for the treatment of colds but the evidence for the prevention of a cold was lacking.13 It is important to note, however, that this review excluded studies using an experimental rhinovirus infection and echinacea preparations with supplements, and it did not include a more recent study by Turner and colleagues.14 We therefore did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold in randomised placebo-controlled studies.",

The concomitant administration of additional nutraceuticals with echinacea could potentially result in synergistic, additive, or inhibitory interactions. Therefore, echinacea's efficacy was assessed both in the presence and absence of other nutraceuticals. Because of the lack of regulation of herbal products, concern has arisen regarding the content of active ingredients contained in various products. A study that evaluated echinacea preparations available in a retail setting showed that six (10%) of 59 preparations contained no measurable echinacea.21 Furthermore, only nine (43%) of 21 standardised preparations met the quality standards as described on the label.21 Five studies in this meta-analysis included an E purpurea product extracted in 22% alcohol (Echinaguard and Echinacin, Madaus AG, Cologne, Germany).22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 As such, an analysis of benefit using these two products was done in a subgroup.

Excluding them might result in increased internal validity but could reduce external validity of the analysis. Additionally, the selection of a random versus fixed-effect model in meta-analyses is controversial. The use of a random-effect model in the calculation of confidence intervals results in wider intervals and thus a more conservative estimate of treatment effect compared with a fixed-effect model. To reconcile these issues, sensitivity analysis was done, in which the meta-analysis was reanalysed excluding studies of weaker methodology (Jadad score less than 3) and using a fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel methodology).",

The Q statistic showed significant heterogeneity in both the incidence and duration analyses. However, review of the L'Abb\u00e9 plot for incidence showed that included studies generally agreed on echinacea's positive effect, but not the magnitude of the benefit (figure 5\n). Some degree of asymmetry was noted upon review of the funnel plots for both the incidence and duration analyses, resulting in our inability to rule out the presence of publication bias in our analyses (figure 6\n). However, when publication bias was assessed using the Egger weighted regression statistic, no significant publication bias was detected for either the incidence or duration analyses (p=0\u00b764 and p=0\u00b779, respectively).",

Although concentration variances exist, all three species of echinacea contain water-soluble polysaccharides, a lipophilic fraction (alkamides, polyacetylenes), caffeoyl conjugates (echinacoside, chicoric acid, caffeic acid) and flavonoids.34, 35 It is yet to be determined if it is one, a few, or the combined effect of many constituents (mainly alkamides, chicoric acid, and polysaccharides) that induce immunostimulation. Despite all of these factors that can influence the efficacy of echinacea and the different doses that can be used, the results of our meta-analysis show that echinacea reduces the incidence as well as the duration of the common cold.",

This study found an 86% reduction in the incidence of the common cold. As such, we cannot determine if the combination of echinacea with other nutraceuticals yields better results than echinacea alone. Several experimental studies have shown that vitamin C might have effects on the immune system.36 Propolis, a natural resinous product collected by honeybees from various plant sources, has also been used in the prevention of respiratory infections.37 For cold duration as the outcome, four studies20, 28, 29, 30 used echinacea combined with additional supplements (vitamin C, propolis, lemongrass leaf, spearmint, peppermint, thyme, citric acid, rosemary leaf, eucalyptus, and fennel seed) and yielded a 1\u00b73-day shorter duration of cold than placebo. Echinacea used alone, although showing a similar benefit, did not show a significantly shorter duration of cold than placebo (p=0\u00b727), suggesting that this sub-group analysis was underpowered. Comparing the results on duration of cold in the overall analysis to the subgroup analyses suggests that the benefit is caused by echinacea rather than the other supplements.",

If echinacea was given prophylactically in an attempt to reduce the incidence of natural cold induction, the incidence was reduced by 65% versus placebo. When echinacea was given as prophylaxis against cold induction caused by direct rhinovirus inoculation, the incidence was only reduced by 35%. One postulation for the possible reduced benefits with direct inoculation is that echinacea works better on preventing the common cold caused by viruses other than rhinovirus. With over 200 viruses capable of causing the common cold, echinacea could have modest effect against rhinovirus but marked effects against other viruses. Of the direct rhinovirus inoculation trials, the most touted is the study by Turner and colleagues14 published in 2005. The authors compared patients given E angustifolia equivalent to 900 mg/day with placebo and showed that echinacea did not have \u201cclinically significant effects on infection with a rhinovirus or on the clinical illness that results from it\u201d. The German Commission E has approved E purpurea at a recommended dose of 900 mg but has not approved E angustifolia.8 The 1999 WHO monograph recommends E angustifolia at a dose of 3 g, a dose more than three times the dose used by Turner and colleagues.38 As such, the dose used in this trial may have been too low to be fully effective.",

Although our results are in agreement with the previous meta-analysis, our results suggest an additional benefit of echinacea for use in the prevention, as well as the treatment, of a cold. The meta-analysis by Linde and colleagues39 assessed a cold severity endpoint, included two unpublished evaluations, and excluded studies that used experimental rhinovirus inoculation or that combined echinacea with other nutraceutical ingredients. In our analysis we chose not to evaluate cold severity because of concerns about the potential heterogeneity of the methods used for cold severity assessment in the studies. We included studies evaluating echinacea with other nutraceuticals in our analysis, as well as studies evaluating direct rhinovirus inoculation, which have the highest internal validity since the virus, the degree of exposure, and the exact time of exposure are all known. We decided to address the effect of these potential confounders through the use of subgroup and sensitivity analyses rather than through exclusion, which provides more information from which to make a determination of the efficacy of echinacea. Furthermore, we included one study that was published after Melchart and colleagues updated their analysis39 and excluded unpublished studies because data in such studies have not undergone rigorous peer review.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this meta-analysis that must be addressed. First, the studies by Barrett20 and Turner14 and their colleagues used alfalfa and a mixture of alcohol beverages, respectively, as their placebo arm. Since alfalfa and alcoholic concoctions may have immunostimulatory benefits, their use in the placebo arm is controversial.40 Although we agree that this may be a potential confounder in our analyses, it should be noted that if these agents do in fact have beneficial properties that reduce the incidence and/or duration of the common cold, then this would result in an underestimation of echinacea's benefit. Second, although the Egger statistic shows absence of publication bias, our funnel plot shows asymmetry, suggesting that the potential for publication bias cannot be eliminated. Publication bias arises when trials with negative outcomes have a lower propensity to be published. Third, heterogeneity was present in our meta-analysis; however, the L'Abb\u00e9 plot shows that the heterogeneity is a result of studies' disagreement in the magnitude, but not the direction, of echinacea's benefit. Furthermore, after doing various subgroup analyses to assess the effect of clinical heterogeneity, echinacea maintained significant effects on the reduction of cold incidence and duration. Finally, this analysis focuses on the efficacy but not the safety of echinacea. Although adverse events with echinacea are not commonly reported, gastrointestinal upset and rash have been reported.6 Much more work needs to be done to elucidate the safety of prolonged therapy since its effect on the rate-corrected QT interval, blood pressure, and other safety parameters is not well known. Of note, echinacea is a human cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme inhibitor so the potential for drug interactions also needs to be assessed.41\n",
