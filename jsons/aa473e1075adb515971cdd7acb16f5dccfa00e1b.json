Bronchoconstriction is the result of bronchial smooth muscle contraction in immediate response to an inhaled irritant or allergen (National 2007) . While classically complete reversal of airway obstruction is indicative of asthma, many cases of asthma may only have a partial reversal in airflow and in some cases no reversal of obstruction. The fixed airway obstruction may in part be due to airway remodeling. Investigations are still underway to understand the exact pathophysiology of this; however, upregulation of growth factors by the bronchial epithelium seems to be the key in the persistent inflammation, smooth muscle hypertrophy, collagen production, neovascularization, basement membrane thickening, and increased myofibroblast and fibroblast activity (Busse et al. 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 161, "text": "(Kudo et al. 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 449, "end": 464, "text": "(National 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1103, "text": "(Busse et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathology/Histopathology"}, {"text": "In allergic asthma, activation of mast cells and T helper (Th2) cells by inhaled antigens leads to production and secretion of histamines, leukotrienes, and cytokines (National 2007) .

Viral infections and airborne allergens are two of the most important environmental factors leading to asthma development, persistence, and possibly asthma severity (NHLBI 2007) . Though allergens and other environmental factors are a strong trigger for many with asthma, complete avoidance is often impossible, and despite avoidance asthma often remains active. For those not responding to avoidance, treatment is based on symptom frequency and severity of disease. Quick relief medications are inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and anticholinergics. Long-term control medications are used to treat persistent asthma and include inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, and oral leukotriene modifiers and methylxanthines.

The diagnosis of ACOS is clinical, and with most of the key symptoms being shared between pure COPD and asthma, it further adds to the challenge of accurately making this diagnosis (Saetta et al. 1994; Barnes 2002) (Fig. 1 ). COPD is considered by most to be a less reversible obstructive airway disease; however, COPD can reverse and even to the same degree as asthma. The symptoms experienced by patients with COPD are common to asthma as well; these include wheezing, coughing, and dyspnea. Both diseases are diagnosed similarly by taking into account the patient's history as well as pulmonary function tests (PFTs).

Symptoms of GERD may be triggered by a select number of foods and drinks such as coffee, chocolate, citrus fruits, tomato-based foods, spicy foods, fatty foods, and alcohol. GERD can present in several different ways and at times can resemble asthma as suggested by the extraesophageal manifestations.

Peripheral eosinophilia with an absolute eosinophil count of 500 cells per microliter or greater supports an eosinophilic pulmonary disease (Valent et al. 2012 ). The degree of eosinophilia does not enable diagnosing the precise etiology (Umeki et al. 1992) . A highresolution CT scan of the chest can provide significant findings early in the course of the disease (Johkoh et al. 2000) . L\u00f6ffler syndrome is one of many diseases classified as an eosinophilic pulmonary disease. It occurs when helminth larvae migrate to the lungs of an infected individual to mature before ascending the airways and return to the gastrointestinal tract (Wilson 2006 ). There are four types of helminths with life cycles within the lung: Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Strongyloides stercoralis (Wilson 2006) . The syndrome was originally described by L\u00f6ffler when patients presented with fleeting pulmonary opacities with peripheral eosinophilia after being exposed to soil contaminated with human waste (L\u00f6ffler 1956).

It is an idiopathic disease occurring predominantly in non-smokers and women (Marchand et al. 1998 ). Symptoms of weight loss and night sweats may occur in addition to respiratory symptoms and laboratory findings, which mimic asthma. In addition to mimicking asthma, 50% of cases of CEP will have a concurrent or historical diagnosis of asthma (Jederlinic 1998) . Peripheral eosinophilia is a typical feature and is present in up to 90% of cases (Marchand et al. 1998) . A virtually pathognomonic finding on chest X-ray is peripheral pulmonary infiltrates, described as the photographic negative of pulmonary edema, and may be observed in up to one-third of CEP cases (Jederlinic 1998) .
