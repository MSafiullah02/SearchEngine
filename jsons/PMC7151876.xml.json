The stratum malpighii layer comprises the primary component of the epidermis, and its dividing and growing keratinocytes serve both a structural function\u2014limiting the passage of water and other molecules\u2014and an immunologic role. Keratinocytes germinate just above the basement membrane, which demarcates the boundary between epidermis and deeper dermis. These cells then grow, flatten, mature, and senesce in increasingly superficial strata until they reach the surface and are sloughed. The main product of this cell is keratinohyalin, a dense lipid that helps form a waterproof barrier. The lateral edges of adjacent keratinocytes are tightly linked by desmosomes, which maintain the strength of the epidermis and also contribute to its resistance to the passage of foreign matter or molecules.51,\n52\n",

Now referred to as the Mantoux method, this procedure has become the common route for ID injection of various antigens (see Figure 61-2G). A short-bevel, fine-gauge needle, usually 27 gauge (0.016 inch, 0.4060 mm diameter), is inserted, bevel up, at a 5 to 15-degree angle into slightly stretched skin, often the volar surface of the forearm.78 The tip is advanced about 3 mm until the entire bevel is covered. Upon injection of fluid, proper location of the bevel in the dermis creates a bleb, or a wheal, as the basement membrane and epidermis above are stretched by the fluid. Leakage onto the skin indicates insufficient penetration to cover the bevel. Failure to produce a bleb indicates an improperly deep location of the fluid in the subcutaneous tissue. Drawbacks to the Mantoux method for mass vaccination campaigns are the training, skill, and extra time needed to accomplish it correctly.",

When administering by the ID route, one-tenth (0.1 mL) the SC dose (1.0 mL) in varying dilutions below the labeled dosage of 800 chick cell agglutinating (CCA) units/mL, Stille and coworkers also found greater ID responses, but only when the SC dosage was low, at 8 or 0.08 CCA (ID dosage: 0.8 and 0.008, respectively).127 In contrast, SC responses exceeded ID ones when the standard SC dosage was used or reduced by only one log (80 CCA; ID, 80 and 8 CCA, respectively). This suggested a linear ID dosage-response curve, but a sigmoid SC one, which favored the ID route at the lower-dosage end. On the other hand, when identical reduced dosages for a new shifted \u201cAsian\u201d strain were given by the two routes (80, 40, or 20 CCA, compared with 200 per full 1.0 mL), both McCarroll and colleagues,141 studying hospital employees 18 to 65 years of age, and Klein and coworkers,142 studying infants 2 months to 5 years of age, found little difference in responses between the ID and SC routes. McCarroll speculated that the ID superiority in earlier studies was the result of an anamnestic effect not present that season. Klein simply doubted any ID superiority when equal volumes are used.",

Considering the entire reduced-dosage, ID influenza literature, this route might be considered when antigen shortages and distributive equity demand the use of the lower end of the dosage-response curve, where ID may outperform the SC or IM route. The increased reactions described in these whole-virus studies would perhaps be mitigated by use of today's less reactogenic split-virus products.",

Adhesive on the patch keeps the system in place until delivery is complete.

At activation, electric pulses are induced to heat the filaments. An adhesive patch containing vaccine or therapeutic agent is then applied over the micropores just created. In a hairless mouse model, this technique elicited 10 to 100-fold greater cellular and humoral responses to an adenovirus vaccine than intact skin, as well as 100% protection to surrogate tumor challenge (27% for intact skin).398 In the same model, adenovirus-vectored melanoma antigen applied to the micropores roughly doubled the average onset time of tumors after challenge, and it protected one of six mice, compared with none of eight vaccinated controls with intact skin. Microporated recombinant influenza H5 hemagglutinin protected BALB/c mice from challenge with a lethal H5N1 strain.401 Skin micropores also permitted the passage of insulin in pharmacokinetic human trials with historical controls,402,\n403 and in the other direction allowed interstitial fluid to be extracted for potential glucose monitoring.404\n",

The Biojector 2000 varies the orifice of different cartridges on the same injector to deliver either by the IM or the SC route (Figure 61-6I\n).83,\n611,\n612 The PharmaJet82 (not shown) varies spring strength of color-coded injectors for IM delivery to different-size patients. For its newer Stratis model, SC delivery is by operator technique to pinch up and inject into the fat layer (see Figure 61-6C). The LectraJet613 can also vary spring strength between models (see Figure 61-6A,B). Given great patient variation, it is no surprise that imaging data suggest that JIs often miss the intended IM or SC compartment.614 However, this may have little clinical relevance and may be no different from needle injections, for which fat-pad thickness is often underestimated when selecting needle length, or when the needle is not fully inserted.615,\n616 In Russia, an unconventional target tissue\u2014the lung\u2014was reached by \u201cintrapulmonary\u201d injections (between the ribs) of antibiotics, bronchodilators, and steroids.617\n",

The studies and clinical trials needed can be extremely expensive. Vaccine manufacturers are typically reluctant to assume such cost and risk to relicense an existing product already delivering profits, unless the potential benefits and market advantages would be significant. The best opportunity to bring alternative delivery into routine practice may be to use new delivery systems from the start for new vaccines early in their development and licensure process.",

Dry aerosols require changes in the formulation and manufacture of the vaccine to achieve and sustain vaccine potency and powder dispersability. If these challenges can be met, dry aerosols have several advantages over liquid aerosols (see \u201cDry-powder formulations for respiratory delivery\u201d, later).",

When challenged more than 1 year later, the MVDP-vaccinated macaques were protected from infection with wild-type measles virus.803 In other studies, the BD Solovent was effective for direct nasal delivery of influenza vaccine to rats, and of anthrax vaccine to rabbits.101,\n804\n",

Enhanced clearance of NTHi from the nasopharynx after challenge was shown equally in both groups.1100 The inclusion of CpG ODNs with four HIV peptide antigens in microparticles delivered by the IN route to mice significantly enhanced peptide-specific IgG and IgA peak titers and prolonged the duration of these antibodies, and it increased the sIgA response in mucosal washes.1101 However, in another study, daily injections of high-dosage (60 \u03bcg) CpG resulted in lymphoid follicle destruction and immunosuppression with liver necrosis after 20 days.1102 Therefore, the potential adverse effects of CpG ODNs should be studied.",

(E) Sumavel DosePro single-use DSJI (Zogenix734), licensed as drug-device combination product for subcutaneous delivery of prefilled sumatriptan for treatment of migraine and cluster headaches.735 Uses novel, borosilicate-glass dose chamber prefilled by drug manufacturer. (F) J-Tip, single-use DSJI,733 powered by compressed nitrogen gas. (G) Injex DSJI,732 metal spring compressed by separate cocking device. (H) Imule manufacturer-prefilled DSJI syringe660,737 for Vaxigrip influenza vaccine (Institut M\u00e9rieux/Pasteur M\u00e9rieux S\u00e9rums & Vaccins736). The syringe served as both primary vaccine packaging in a presentation smaller than conventional single-dose glass vial (millimeter scale on left), as well as the single-use disposable syringe for jet injection. Upon removing the label (H, center), inserting into the Mini-Imojet DSJI (not shown), and removing the rubber cap (H, right), the dose was ready for injection. Studied in human trials for five vaccines134,648,650 and found successful in immune responses and safety. Subsequently abandoned by the manufacturer. (I) Biojector 2000 DSJI (Bioject Medical Technologies83), capable of subcutaneous and intramuscular injections using syringes of differing orifice diameters.614 Cleared for US marketing by FDA in 1990s. Powered by compressed CO2 cartridge, or by connection to separate compressed gas source. An investigational spacer for intradermal delivery (illustrated elsewhere22) creates a 2-cm air gap to weaken the jet stream, leaving the injectate in the skin. Used by US Navy and Coast Guard for approximately one-third million vaccinations per year of sailors and dependents from 1997 through 2011. (J) ZetaJet metal-spring-powered DSJI,83 features built-in crank for manual re-cocking of metal spring (Bioject Medical Technologies83). Uses different auto-disabling cartridges for SC, IM, and ID injections (licensed by US FDA in 2009). See Figure 61-2K for intradermal DSJI from same device manufacturer. (K) Investigational Iject DSJI,83,730 designed for either single-use or reuse upon refitting with its manufacturer-prefilled borosilicate glass dose chamber.",

(A) and (B) Investigational Classic Mexican Device for aerosol vaccine delivery, illustrated by component diagram (A) and use in clinical trials (B). A nonmedical electric compressor (not shown) delivers roughly 9 L of air per minute at a pressure of 30 to 40 psi (207 to 276 kPa) to a jet nebulizer that is kept in crushed ice to maintain vaccine potency. The vaccine aerosol (roughly 0.15 cm3 of particles averaging 4.3 \u03bcm in diameter) is delivered through a disposable paper cone held close to the patient's face for 30 seconds.776, 777, 778, 779 (From Valdespino-G\u00f3mez JL, de Lourdes Garcia-Garcia M, Fernandez-de-Castro J, et al.

Prefilled liquid vaccine is stored refrigerated for single patient use. The total volume is 0.2 mL. A dose separator interrupts delivery at 0.1 mL and, when reset, allows the remaining 0.1 mL to be administered into the opposite nostril. (E) and (F) Investigational AeroVax prototype (AerovectRx, Inc.,808 developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Creare, Inc.805). The (E) nebulizer utilizes battery-powered piezoelectric energy to drive an aerosol from a disposable drug cartridge via a microperforated mesh plate through a disposable patient interface, such as (F) nasal prong in patient nostril, oral prong, or mask (not shown). Droplet diameters can be tailored from < 5 \u03bcm to 10 to 25 \u03bcm for upper or lower airway delivery, respectively.",
