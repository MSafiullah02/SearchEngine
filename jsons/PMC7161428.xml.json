Most human and murine vaccine studies rely on using crude Mtb fractions, Mtb peptides or recombinant Mtb proteins as antigens to assess the immunogenicity and function of vaccine-elicited T cells. An underlying assumption has been that most Mtb antigen-specific T cells elicited during natural infection will recognize Mtb-infected antigen presenting cells (APC).

Thus, T cells primed in the lymph nodes during natural infection may not necessarily recognize antigens presented by Mtb-infected macrophages in the lung.11 Regardless of the mechanism, we wondered whether the inability of some T cells to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages might explain why the number of antigen-specific T cells may not necessarily correlate with vaccine-induced protection.",

Using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), we quantify the frequency of T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages during primary infection in mice. We find that an unexpectedly low frequency of ex vivo CD8 and CD4 T cells recognizes Mtb-infected macrophages. We demonstrate that majority of the T cells from C57BL/6 mice that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages are conventionally MHC-restricted T cells. Our data show that CD4 T cells efficiently detect Mtb-infected macrophages at a lower MOI, whereas CD8 T cells only recognize more heavily infected cells. Using proof-of-concept vaccination studies, we show that BCG elicits T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We envision this novel assay as a complementary approach to immunogenicity studies and mycobacterial growth inhibition assays. By specifically measuring the frequency of vaccine-elicited T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages pre-challenge, this assay could provide another criterion to help screen and prioritize the selection of T-cell-based vaccines for preclinical and clinical development.",

In contrast, fewer than 35% of macrophages were infected at an MOI of 1 (Fig. 1c). Although 90% of the macrophages were infected at an MOI of 20, there was a drastic decrease in macrophage viability (Fig. 1c). Using an MOI of 4 for our assays led to a median effective MOI of about 5 (range 2\u201313) (Fig. 1d).

To first validate the assay, we diluted ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells (hereafter, C7 T cells; see Methods) into an excess of splenic T cells from uninfected C57BL/6 mice. Minimal activation of C7 T cells occurred when they were cultured with uninfected macrophages (Fig. 1e). There was no activation of the na\u00efve C57BL/6T cells when cultured with infected macrophages or uninfected macrophages and ESAT-63-17 peptide (data not shown). When the C7 and na\u00efve T-cell mixture was cocultured with Mtb-infected macrophages, specific spots were produced by 40\u221250% of the input C7 cells, and specific spots were detected even when their frequency was as low as 0.04% of the total T cells (Fig. 1e). When ESAT-63\u221217 peptide was provided in excess, 70\u221280% of input C7 T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 (i.e., 150 spots per 200 C7 cells, Fig. 1e). We then used Ag85b-specific CD4 T cells (hereafter, P25 cells) in this assay. We observed that more than half of the P25 T cells that recognized Ag85b240-254 peptide could recognize Mtb-infected macrophages (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, infected macrophages did not inhibit T-cell production of IFN-\u03b3 in response to the cognate peptide. Based on our results with C7 and P25 T cells, the Mtb-Infected Macrophage ELISPOT (MIME) appeared to represent a sensitive and specific way to identify T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.",

Although the frequency of TB10.44\u221211-specific CD8 T cells tracked the frequency of MIME+ CD8 T cells, our prior work shows that TB104\u221211-specific CD8 T cells do not recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.4 The lower percentage of T cells that produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to Ag85b240\u2212254, ESAT-63\u221217, 32a93\u2212102 and TB10.44\u221211 compared to the percentage of T cells that produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to Mtb-infected macrophages suggest that additional Mtb-specific T-cell antigens and/or epitopes presented by the infected macrophages contribute to the higher IFN-\u03b3 produced in response to infected macrophages. Although we do not know the identity of these antigens, nearly 80 distinct Mtb proteins have been shown to be recognized by murine T cells (S.M.B., unpublished observation, based on data at IEDB.org). In conclusion, although the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages increased over time, it was still a low percentage of the total splenic or pulmonary T cells.",

Surprisingly, only a 40\u221250% reduction in SFC frequency was seen when CD4 T cells were cultured with Mtb-infected MHCII\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. 3c). One possibility is that these CD4 T cells included large numbers of nonconventional T cells16,17; or that these CD4 T cells were conventional T cells driven to secrete IFN\u03b3 by IL-12 produced by Mtb-infected macrophages.18,19 When CD4 T cells were cultured with Mtb-infected WT macrophages in the presence of anti-IL-12 mAb, no reduction in IFN-\u03b3 production was observed (Fig. 3d). However, when CD4 T cells were cultured with MHCII\u2212/\u2212 Mtb-infected macrophages and anti-IL-12 mAb, there was a significant reduction in the SFC frequency compared to the control groups (Fig. 3d). These data indicate that while IL-12 is sufficient for noncognate activation of lung CD4 T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3, the majority of the CD4 T-cell response is MHCII-restricted, and cognate activation of CD4 T cells does not require IL-12. In conclusion, our data show that majority of both CD8 and CD4 T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages through classical MHC recognition.",

To assess whether T-cell recognition of Mtb antigens is similar to the recognition of Mtb-infected macrophages, we took advantage of the megapool of 300 peptides (p300) representing 90 antigens, all of which are frequently recognized by human CD4 T cells from healthy IGRA+ individuals,23 and which contains epitopes recognized by murine CD4 and CD8 T cells (CSLA, based on data available in the IEDB). The advantage of the megapool compared to other crude Mtb antigens (e.g., culture filtrate proteins, Mtb lysate or PPD) is that the epitopes are present at equimolar concentrations, and as epitopes are in the form of peptides and not proteins, they are efficiently presented by MHC I even when added exogenously to APC. We cocultured lung cells obtained from mice that had been infected for 4 weeks with Mtb-infected macrophages, or with the p300 megapool, and measured IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells. The CD4 T-cell response was skewed more towards the recognition of Mtb-infected macrophages than to the p300 megapool, indicating that some epitopes presented by Mtb-infected murine macrophages are not represented in the p300 megapool. In contrast, the CD8 T-cell response was skewed towards the recognition of the p300 megapool (Fig. 5a). Thus, CD8 T cells recognize Mtb antigens that are either poorly presented or are not presented by Mtb-infected cells but are represented in the p300 pool (e.g., TB10.41\u221215). Compared to CD8 T cells, a greater frequency of CD4 T cells recognized Mtb-infected macrophages, indicating that CD4 T cells recognize Mtb-infected cells better than CD8 T cells at this time point (Fig. 5a).",

CD4 T cells readily recognized infected-macrophages, even at a low MOI, and recognition increased at an MOI of 1.2 and plateaued at an MOI of 5.8 (Fig. 5b). In contrast, there was little or no recognition by CD8 T cells at a low MOI, although recognition increased significantly when the MOI was increased to 5.8. (Fig. 5b).

Much T-cell-based vaccine development operates under the paradigm that Mtb-specific T cells elicited by natural infection will recognize infected APC. A corollary is that if such T cells can be elicited by vaccination, they will mediate protection against Mtb. Recent data challenge this assumption and show that not all Mtb-antigen-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.4,6,7,25 This concept is consistent with data from a recent clinical trial where CD8 T cells elicited by an adenoviral-vectored vaccine expressing Mtb antigens either failed to recognize or only modestly recognized Mtb-infected DC.26 The current paradigm needs to incorporate the possibility that some Mtb antigens, which elicit immunodominant responses, may not be presented by Mtb-infected APC.4 A strategy to enumerate T-cell recognition of Mtb-infected APC could deepen our understanding of host\u2212pathogen interactions and assist in the development of new vaccines.",

These were important considerations since bystander APC can present antigens released from Mtb-infected cells or from dying cells, as described for DC.25,27\u201330 We hypothesized that there would be a discrepancy between the frequency of T cells that recognize peptide epitopes versus Mtb-infected macrophages. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a minority of purified CD4 and CD8 T cells from the lungs of Mtb-infected mice recognized Mtb-infected macrophages, although the frequency was sometimes higher, particularly during chronic infection. In our studies, >90% of the CD8 T cells capable of recognizing Mtb-infected macrophages were class I MHC-restricted. The CD4 T-cell response was more complicated. In the absence of class II MHC, IL-12 was sufficient to drive noncognate IFN-\u03b3 secretion by a subset of pulmonary CD4 T cells. When IL-12 was blocked, we found that majority of the IL-12-driven IFN-\u03b3 secretion was abrogated, and >80% of the CD4 T cells were class II MHC-restricted. A similar observation was made for IL-18, which can drive antigen-experienced CD4 T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3 following Salmonella infection.14,18 Our data show that WT Mtb-infected macrophages are recognized by CD4 T cells in the presence of a strong TCR stimulus, and this recognition is independent of IL-12.",

The case is even more extreme for CD8 T cells. It is unknown whether 32a93\u2212102 is presented by Mtb-infected macrophages; but TB10.44\u221211 is not.4 Thus, fewer than 10% of the total CD8 T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages can be accounted for by known epitopes. Consistent with these observations, our MIM-ICS data strongly suggest that there are other epitopes for CD4 T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages but are not represented in the multipeptide pool 300. Conversely, there are epitopes for CD8 T cells that may not be efficiently presented by Mtb-infected macrophages but are overrepresented in the multipeptide pool 300. The megapool consists of Mtb epitopes recognized by human CD4 T cells and a peptide pool designed for the mouse is not available. Although there is overlap between the epitopes recognized by human and murine T cells, there are likely to be differences in MHC-binding and immunodominance between the two species. Thus, if a peptide pool were available for C57BL/6 mice, we might expect that frequency of T cells recognizing peptide epitopes to increase, which would lead to a larger discrepancy between the repertoire of T cells that recognize Mtb antigens and those that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Our data for MIM-ICS and multipeptide pool 300 are obtained using mice infected for 4 weeks, and the recognition pattern represents differences in CD4 and CD8 T-cell biology during TB infection at this time. It may be interesting for future studies to assess if different skewing patterns may emerge during chronic phases of infection, especially since CD8 T-cell recognition of infected macrophages increases during chronic phases.",

Fortunately, both the ELISPOT and ICS assays can be modified to detect more than one cytokine. A second limitation is the focus on antigens that are presented during the first 48 h of in vitro infection. An interesting issue was that the frequency of epitope-specific T cells differed between assays.21,31,32 Key differences in methodologies and the timing (see Methods) make direct comparisons difficult. Similar discrepancies between elispot and ICS assays were previously found for the T-cell response to protein antigens.32 For the class II MHC-restricted peptide epitopes, ICS led to a greater calculated frequency than tetramers or elispot, while for the class I MHC-restricted epitopes, the frequency based on tetramer staining and ICS were similar, and greater than that determined by the elispot assay. One possibility is that the class II tetramers may inefficiently detect low affinity antigen-specific T cells, which may be more sensitively detected by dodecamers.33 Regardless, both the Mtb-infected macrophage ELISPOT and the Mtb-infected macrophage ICS assay yield similar frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.",

Additionally, macrophage phagosomes are more degradative compared to DC phagosomes, which may lead to differences in antigen presentation.38,39 Limited information is available concerning the capacity of ex vivo T cells to recognize Mtb-infected cells.24,34\u201337,40\u201342 Barriers to these experiments include the low frequency of antigen-specific T cells in human blood and technical difficulties using live Mtb-infected cells, especially macrophages. Most human and murine studies use DC as the infected cell.40 Although the Flynn lab assessed lymph node and lung T-cell recognition of Mtb-infected DC, these studies found very low frequencies of T cells that recognized Mtb-infected DC.40,43 Possible confounders include the use of total lung cells instead of purified T cells and the reliance on anti-MHCI or anti-MHCII antibodies to estimate the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing Mtb-infected DC, respectively. The interpretation of data using class II MHC blocking antibodies is problematic because of noncognate activation of CD4 T cells, as we observed (Fig. 3). While the Lewinsohn lab found that human CD4 and CD8 T cells recognize Mtb-infected DC, and CD8 T cells recognize heavily infected DC, T-cell clones were used for this study.

Why then, despite an apparent increase in the frequency MIME+ T cells late during infection, is there a failure to control the lung bacterial burden? Such T cells may become dysfunctional47 or fail to be optimally positioned to interact with infected APC.48,49 Another possibility is that infected macrophages inefficiently present bacterial antigens to T cells, either because of active immune evasion or APC dysfunction. Alternatively, antigen presentation by Mtb-infected cells could be limited because when intracellular bacilli are present at low numbers (i.e., <5 bacilli/cell) or are metabolically quiescent, there is little antigen available for presentation. Our data that polyclonal CD8 T cells preferentially recognize Mtb-infected macrophages at higher MOIs are consistent with published data showing human CD8 T-cell clones preferentially recognize heavily infected DC.24 Furthermore, we show that CD4 T cells are better able to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages at a higher MOI and their ability is also limited at lower MOIs. Whether this disparity could also be affected by differences in macrophages vs. DC, mouse vs. human APCs, or ex vivo vs. cultured T cells, remains to be determined. It would be interesting to characterize CD4 and CD8 T cells that can recognize low-MOI-infected macrophages as this may identify antigens that are more likely to be presented during natural infection or post-challenge. Increasingly, we favor the idea that vaccine failure has little to do with the quality of the T cells that are elicited; instead, the problem is that vaccine-elicited T cells may not recognize infected APC that harbor few bacilli.",
