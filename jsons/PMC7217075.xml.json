            "text": "COVID-19 was first recognized in December 2019 and within months evolved into a global pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. To avert its rapid spread, country-specific restrictions have been introduced spanning strict social/physical distancing measures, stay-at-home orders and even lockdowns, workplace closings and furloughs/layoffs, postponing of elective procedures in medical centers to preserve medical resources, suspending many in-person medical consultation and clinic visits, or substituting these face to face consultations with remote interventions, e.g. telecommunications. Measures to limit person-to-person contact affected institutions and researchers applying non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) operations. With the suddenness of COVID-19 emergence, operations at clinics and research centers administering NIBS were disrupted to varied degrees - from suspension of all activities, to limiting new enrollment or abbreviation protocols, to incremental accommodations - depending on regional restrictions and the nature of underling protocols (e.g. in-person treatment vs remote treatment). The means of maintaining (and even expanding) access to NIBS during the COVID-19 pandemic are strategically evolving. Considering that NIBS is a unique non-pharmacological tool, forms of which have been successfully established for treatment of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]], often on moderately or even severely impaired patients unresponsive to conventional therapies [8, 9], the reestablishment of NIBS operations in the current era of COVID-19 pandemic as well as through future epidemics is of paramount importance.",

Along with general guidelines and checklists, we provide an overview on the different strategies that have been introduced to mitigate the spread of the virus in NIBS procedures and NIBS laboratories. Additionally, we highlight new opportunities for NIBS regarding the current situation and discuss possible directions of research that could be taken considering the expected development of COVID-19-related diseases and disorders.

General tele-work practices and routines have also been introduced across NIBS centers to enable the remote working teams to maintain productivity, while monitoring and supporting the well-being, education, and professional development of staff (see section 5). For example, early career scientists and students concerned with the degree progress should, as appropriate, be offered additional support by adapting progress requirements (e.g. 3 months extensions concerning thesis submission deadlines) and providing them opportunities for online networking. Several respondents to our survey highlighted the opportunity to learn new skills online (through webinars, online lab meetings with guest speakers and online conferences). Responders are thus positive that the NIBS community could benefit from tele-work intellectual activities developed in the pandemic period (e.g. online conferences, papers, experimental designs, teaching materials, etc.) and the establishment of tele-communication tools should serve the NIBS community even beyond the pandemic period (e.g. project tracking and updates, new collaborations).",

Ultimately, staff will have to follow regulatory and protection procedures adopted by specific research or clinical settings (e.g. nursing home setting) will have to follow COVID-19measures for that setting; or in-person visit at a patient\u2019s home will require compliance with COVID-19protection mandated for home care. Therefore, developing and updating protocol specific safety procedures requires research staff communication and coordination with institutional (clinical) leadership for the specific setting in which NIBS studies will be carried out.5)Implement all institution required safety procedures (e.g. screening, PPE, COVID-19testing, etc.). Develop study-specific considerations for staff who recovered COVID-19.6)Consider changes in intervention that do not impact trial integrity (e.g. number of visits, inclusion/exclusion) or consider changes that strategically change trial scope (i.e. still allow for meaningful publishable outcomes; e.g. changing to a pilot trial).7)For in-person protocols, streamline the entire process from participant preparing to leave their home, to transportation, to arriving at clinic/lab, to leaving the clinic/lab to maximize social/physical distancing (including between patients and between staff) with special attention to neuromodulation steps; where possible, the clinical trial may provide support for car service for participants to avoid public transportation.8)Add additional telemedicine steps (follow-ups) to adjust for changes in protocol; Add steps responsive to COVID-19 related concerns. This can include additional data collection that may impact immediate decisions (vii) or later analysis such as testing all subject temperature or surveying for COVID-19 related symptoms. Determine protocol for identified COVID-19 positive patients, including if they are not critically ill or without symptoms.9)Review explicit protocols/consideration for adverse events (related or not to the intervention) so that the decision tree (what to do, who makes the call, what needs to be reported) is mapped out beforehand (patient or caregiver has X symptoms leading to Y actions).10)Obtain IRB approval for any applicable changes (e.g. all the above) in protocol including patient consent in regard to any new anticipated risks.11)Take steps to share your plans, lessons, learned, and ongoing experiences with the broader community.

Once the participant signs the consent, typically with either video observation or through a secure online signature process, this enables the investigator to proceed with the screening visit, which can be facilitated using electronic forms (e.g. RedCap, Qualtrics, ClinCapture).

While online tools cannot replace face-to-face interactions, they are vital substitutes in current times. The vast majority of labs will have moved work meetings online already, but in addition to these it is important to recognize that for many work is also a social experience and now more than ever, an essential source of support. Scheduled coffee breaks, games nights, film nights, cocktail hours (with alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink of choice) and many other social events are all being implemented successfully across the world to create at least some of the social interactions so important to both our mental wellbeing and our lab cohesion. Explicitly matching group members in a buddy-scheme, where each lab member has a partner that they have to contact even briefly each day, is a way of providing a light touch method to flag potential mental health issues early. While we cannot prevent the inevitable increased rates of mental health problems in our community, making sure that we explicitly discuss the difficulties we all face in this pandemic, and the inevitable mental health repercussions, will hopefully allow those facing particular problems to speak out and receive the support they need [15].",

The latter in turn has mainly been recommended because one dominant way by which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted is by airborne droplet infection. More specifically, aerosols emanating from the upper respiratory pathway housing the virus in high concentrations are thought to passively \u201ctravel\u201d through the air and remain airborne for some time. While the exact travel distance and the amount of time that infectious materials maintain in the air are currently a matter of debate, most recommendations suggest keeping (at least) 2 m (6 ft) distance to any other person and assuming that any unknown person could potentially be infectious [22].

Among other treatments, use of neuromodulation techniques has been proposed to enhance/facilitate stroke-recovery. Past studies have integrated centrally acting tDCS with peripherally acting intensive motor or language rehabilitation protocols [[29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. Before COVID-19, there were several tDCS aphasia treatment protocols published with positive outcomes [38] but during the first half of March, the pandemic forced most of the labs involved in NIBS and stroke recovery to suspend clinical and research activities. COVID-19 has significantly increased the risk of social isolation and associated depression in people with aphasia. Indeed, language and cognitive problems limit the use of digital media (i.e. cellular and/or social network) to maintain social contact. Patients with motor symptoms have also been penalized as a result of COVID-19 since it might be more difficult for them to move or get around with limited caregiver and physical or occupational therapy support. Stroke patients being in an older age category increase the risk of contracting the virus and potentially having a worse outcome; thus, in order to contain the exposure, they will probably be forced to stay-at-home for a longer period than young people augmenting the possibility of psychological distress and depression. To address these mental health issues, researchers from the Aphasia research Lab at the IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome have launched an online interview in the aphasic population to evaluate whether anxiety and fear towards COVID-19 contagion would discourage the restart of rehabilitation. One concern is that patients worried about COVID-19 may be deprioritizing their neurorehabilitation needs and may develop an attitude of resistance towards clinical research, deemed non-essential.",

            "text": "Assuming that regulatory agencies and medical centers will hopefully lift the research and clinical treatment suspensions in the coming months when appropriate mitigations plans are in place, it is important to consider that tDCS protocols for motor and/or aphasia rehabilitation will be hampered by the difficulty in maintaining an adequate safety distance during electrodes application and even more importantly by the mandatory use of masks. Indeed, for language and cognitive interventions, it is extremely important that both the therapist and the patient understand each other, being able to see their mouth\u2019s movements (i.e. \u2018lip-reading\u2019 is known to facilitate communication). Transparent face shields without masks might be a good alternative option here. However, these will not resolve the question of electrode application while keeping a safety distance. Another possibility is to develop remote, but supervised and controlled interventions at the patient\u2019s home using home-based tDCS devices. As appealing as this sounds, considering that most patients have cognitive and physical limitations in applying the \u2018kit\u2019 and that NIBS approaches require a peripheral intervention (e.g. traditional speech therapy or physical-occupational therapies), it will be challenging to provide these combined approaches in a patient home. For stroke patients, there might be also an option to develop remote intervention in an outpatient clinical setting ensuring that there is enough separation and physical distance between the patient and the investigators. There is no doubt that requests will be made to regulatory agencies to allow for clinical research in stroke recovery to be conducted in a remote way or at the patient\u2019s home by integrating tDCS with other telerehabilitation techniques and digital interventions e.g. computer delivered rehabilitation. In this way, we may resolve the issue related to language distortion due to wearing a cover that, masking not only verbal communication but also facial expressions, would anyway hinder communication exchanges. Moreover, since some tDCS language protocols have already been validated, we might think of offering caps to the patient\u2019s family with the position of the electrodes already fixed to facilitate and standardized application. However, we must be mindful that by doing so we may be limiting the breath of patients we can study and the generalisability of our findings e.g. only those who have prior experience using digital technologies, with limited cognitive difficulties, who have family members that can monitor and assist putting on the \u2018home-kits would benefit from those treatments. We also have to consider the safety of the remote tDCS protocols. Patients might be at a risk of seizures after stroke and fatigue is an important factor which might interfere. So timing and careful monitoring of the remote interventions are additional variables to take into account. Considering past remote neuromodulation studies and current COVID-19-related problems, tDCS protocols either at home or in a remote location at a medical center (separating the patient from the clinician) may be an opportunity as well as a challenge in the future.",

We are now commencing a novel pediatric telehealth NIBS study investigating tDCS in the home setting via remote/telehealth specifically for children with perinatal stroke and resultant cerebral palsy. This study is informed by our previous adult stroke neuromodulation telehealth studies, and previous established guidelines. The first phase of this study will investigate the feasibility and reliability of parents/caregivers in operating the device and positioning the electrodes.

Inpatient or residential treatments have been interrupted since the substantial risk of coronavirus spread with congregation of individuals in a limited space. Alcohol and marijuana sales have also increased as, in many areas of the world, businesses that dispense/sell these products have been some of the few businesses to remain open as they are often deemed essential services.

The potentially devastating impact on access to rehabilitation therapies due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate on families and children with disabilities has yet to be fully realized. Telerehabilitation, as an alternative means to access rehabilitation intervention, has been successfully and feasibly performed in diverse populations of children with disabilities and by diverse telerehabilitation strategies [54]. Considering the construct, telerehabilitation in children has been reported to initially involve face-to-face discussion and education for both the parents and the child [55]. Additionally, specific considerations are indicated for pediatric populations, and integration of parents. In a pediatric telerehabilitation study aiming to increase treatment opportunities in cognitive training for children, Corti et al. integrated assessments of the feasibility of interventions and the study design in the home setting [55]. Key aspects of these assessments included \u2018accessibility, training compliance, technical smoothness and training motivation\u2019, along with assessments of recruitment, enrollment and retention. The authors found integration of the assessments to establish the study well-suited and remarkably high adherence to the protocol. Inherently, integrating tDCS with telerehabilitation would raise unique considerations, at the forefront-safety and reliability-with tDCS applications. To date there are no current publications surrounding pediatric tele-neuromodulation. Therefore, to adapt our current clinical research neuromodulation study to a tele-neuromodulation neuromodulation model with supervision for children who are diagnosed with stroke at or around the time of birth, we are currently integrating guidelines established by Charvet et al, [47, 56] and further work in adult stroke by Van de Winckel et al [57].",

Now with our latest study, \u2018Single -Session tDCS in Cerebral Palsy\u2019 [58], we are investigating the neurophysiology and behavioral outcomes surrounding tDCS in children with varying forms of circuitry. We had safely and feasibly completed sessions in 19 children with stroke by the time COVID-19 put our study on hold. However, from the commencement of this study, this study garnered local, national and international interest from families of children with stroke, many traveling great distances and incurring staggering related costs of travel to participate. The COVID-19 challenge has now encouraged us to consider how to potentially integrate tele-neuromodulation for children at home and could allow a broader catchment area of families previously unable to travel and enroll. Integrating accessibility and compliance in these unique teams of parents/children with cerebral palsy, our remote training and education laboratory \u2018tDCS supervisors\u2019 will incorporate training the \u2018lay assistant\u2019 (parent) as to tDCS delivery, and the \u2018tDCS user\u2019 (child). For ease of tDCS electrode placement, integration of a pre-marked skull cap with 10-20 electroencephalogram system electrode coordinates, indicating the C3 C4 locations to approximate the primary motor cortex will facilitate anode/cathode positioning based on the indicated montage. Assessments of reliability of set-up, and electrode placement, and prior to commencing the stimulation sessions and monitoring tolerance and impedance will be paramount, along with establishing a consistent and reliable method of remote communication (e.g. Zoom) during the set-up, stimulation session, and pre/post assessment trials.",

Patients are required to document adverse events and side effects in a diary and the stimulation module is saving the parameters of each session, which t can be downloaded in the study center. Unfortunately, several patients were not able to visit the center at the end of the stimulation session, therefore the objective measurements (e.g. perimetry) are still missing.

ACT involves a 3-month cognitive training intervention paired with 20 in lab/clinic sessions of either active or sham tDCS. Participants undergo cognitive training and tDCS 5 days/week for the first two weeks, then complete cognitive training at home on a study supplied laptop 4 days per week with 1 day per week in lab/clinic for stimulation. At present, the ACT trial has randomized 307 of 360 older adults targeted for randomization in the trial. As this trial works with a population at high risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, in-person study activities were stopped on March 13, 2020. At this time, 22 participants were actively in the intervention phase of the trial. As ACT is a definitive Phase III trial near its completion, a late phase change to at-home tDCS procedures would significantly undermine trial integrity for evaluation of definitive benefits from tDCS paired with cognitive training, as only a small subset of participants would receive the alternative intervention approach. Even were the current COVID-19 outbreak to occur earlier in the trial, a significant change in intervention procedures would likely not be feasible for a Phase III trial. In addition, the primary outcome measure in the ACT trial is currently not available through telemedicine, further preventing continuation of trial activities through a fully remote process. In ACT, 22 participants whose interventions were interrupted will need to be replaced. In addition, approximately 40 participants will miss the timing of their final 1 year follow-up assessment and MRI visits as of the current date. Careful consideration with the trials data safety monitoring board and funding agency program office will need to be given regarding whether these 40 participants will need to be replaced in the trial as well. Pre-COVID-19, ACT was within 14 months of completion. With the loss of 22 participants, the study will likely not be completed for 24-26 months. Should the 40 participants missing their 1 year time point need to be replaced, trial completion could be delayed to 36 months or more. While the extent of delay is still to be determined, this serves as a poignant example of how COVID-19 is directly impacting the speed of progress in medical science. This example also further highlights the critical importance of advancing remotely supervised methods of neuromodulation administration. In ACT, participants complete cognitive training at home for a large portion of the trial. Were this initially paired with remote tDCS, the overall impact on ACT would be significantly reduced. However, lack of availability of primary outcome measures for remote online or tele-administration would have still led the ACT trial to pause activities. Thus, it is also important to note that there is a strong need for overarching work attempting to facilitate remote assessment activities for clinical trials.",

There is evidence that tDCS can extend the benefit of TMS or ECT treatments [50, 67]. When ECT and TMS services are not available the operant decision is not the comparative efficacy of various NIBS techniques [68] but the risk/benefit ratio of trialing tDCS. The risk of tDCS is considered non-significant and safe, including across clinical populations [[69], [70], [71]] - indeed tDCS is broadly applied to healthy subjects (e.g. college students [72]). Specifically for major depressive disorder, controlled trials [[73], [74], [75]], meta-analysis [68, 76, 77] and expert consensus [78] suggest tDCS is comparably effective with significantly less adverse events than drug therapy. Consideration for deploying remote-tDCS treatment should be based on the latest clinical trial data [56].",

For many research studies there is a Consent Visit, Screening Visit, and Follow-Up visits. One of the benefits of the COVID-19 crisis has been a widespread familiarity and increasing comfort with video conferencing software (e.g. Zoom, Webex, VSee). It is important to ensure the security of the videoconferencing platform when connecting with patients or study participants, however, with respect to institutional requirements for HIPAA compliant communications. Given that TMS studies often require at least one in-person intervention visit, transforming our protocols to embrace video techniques for all other visits would improve the risk benefit ratio for the staff and the participants. Additionally, research groups may want to consider adding \u201cCOVID-19-related illness\u201d as an exclusionary criteria or as part of the risks for participating in a research study which relies on multiple in-person visits (should the institution deem this necessary).",

            "text": "Fixed frequency rTMS (e.g. 10 Hz) is the oldest and most established stimulation protocol and has been FDA-approved for use in treatment resistant major depressive disorder for many years. In recent years however, bursting frequency protocols (e.g. theta burst stimulation (TBS)) have emerged as highly potent and temporally efficient forms of brain stimulation; that is, 600 pulses of intermittent TBS (iTBS) delivered over 45 seconds result in an elevation in cortical excitability comparable to 2000 pulses of 10 Hz TMS delivered over 15 minutes [79]. The effects of a single session last approximately 30 minutes, but repeated sessions have similar durability and efficacy as 10Hz rTMS [80] 34 and were first described in the motor cortex. Several recent, clinical trials applying TBS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have demonstrated treatment outcomes with iTBS are comparable to treatment outcomes with traditional 10 Hz rTMS in major depressive disorder. Furthermore, these protocols have similar side-effects, safety, and tolerability profiles. The advantages of elevated potency and efficiency are coupled with a rigorous biologic foundation as theta is an endogenous neural rhythm associated with learning and memory. By using TBS, the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices can be increased several times without compromising clinical effectiveness or safety. In this COVID-19 era, one way to minimize the length of the time that a participant or patient has to be present in the room with a staff member would certainly be for investigators to consider using bursting frequency rTMS protocols which appear to be more efficient pulse-to-pulse. The shorter duration of the stimulation session also provides more flexibility when considering changes in workflow and schedules to ensure that patients do not overlap and thorough infection control measures are applied after every session.",

            "text": "The development of novel, accelerated TMS dosing strategies is another opportunity for clinical researchers. Previous studies have demonstrated that delivering multiple TMS sessions per day has similar efficacy to a single TMS session per day when the total number of TMS administrations is equal [[82], [83], [84]]. Given that the total number of TMS sessions appears to be a critical factor in behavioral change, these concentrated dosing protocols would be attractive to both patients and providers. While these protocols are being explored in research laboratories however, there is still a gap in our knowledge regarding the parameters that optimally balance efficiency with long-term efficacy. In one of the most concentrated TMS protocols to date Williams and colleagues (2018) recently published a study of 6 individuals with highly refractory depression (5 days, 10 sessions/day, 1800 pulses of iTBS/session, 50 minute inter-session interval) which demonstrated that this rapid dosing schedule was feasible and was effective as a rapid antidepressant [85, 86]. Galletly and colleagues (2010), for example, elegantly demonstrated that TMS delivered 3 times/week achieved overall similar outcomes to 5 times/week as long as the overall number of administrations was the same (18-20 administrations) [87]. While most accelerated TMS studies are being done in Major Depressive Disorder, they are also being used in many currently recruiting drug and alcohol treatment research trials [[88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93]]. These protocols reflect dosing schedules that are likely more tenable for patients who likely have job and family responsibilities (often 3 days per week versus the standard 5 days per week). They are being used by researchers around the world. By decreasing the number of times a participant or patient needs to come to the laboratory/clinic, accelerated TMS schedules will also minimize the number of days that individual spends out of the house, the number of times they use public transportation, and the number of other person-encounters they have over the course of their treatment (as 30 sessions of TMS could be given in as little as 3 or 6 days as has been tried at various institutions in the United States). On the other hand, although it reduces the total time of TMS treatment, patients need to stay longer in the TMS environment, from one or two hours mounting up to the entire day.",

Perhaps the most provocative (but still chimerical) opportunity is for increased investment and innovation in a portable means for TMS delivery. There are several patents currently for portable TMS devices (e.g. for the treatment of migraine attacks Starling et al. [94]) and several papers have recently been published describing personalized TMS helmet designs which stabilize the coil [95] and wearable TMS coil designs [96]. Currently, however, there are no devices being made for commercial use. The ability to distill the power of electromagnetic induction as a brain stimulation tool into a briefcase-sized device has the potential to revolutionize non-invasive neuromodulation as a field. To see this materialize from a fantasy to a reality on the tails of the COVID-19 crisis could, in fact, be one of the biggest achievements the neuromodulation field may gain from this experience. It will, however, take talent, time, and investment to make this happen. One should also balance the safety balance of reducing exposure to the coronavirus with the exposure to the yet unclear risks of patient self-application of home-based TMS.",

These decisions should be made with sensitivity to many factors including the potential risk of COVID-19 exposure to the participants and staff for in-person visits and the potential benefit to participants & patients of the intervention. Those trials involved structural or functional imaging remains restricted based on the opening of imaging facilities. Similarly, any TMS trials involving parallel in-person protocols (e.g. rehabilitation) are considered in totality. While there will be many factors that influence this decision for each TMS study, there are some common themes that will minimize risk (electronic visits when possible, accelerated treatment courses, shorter pulse sequences like theta burst, use of technological methods such as neuronavigation and scalp modeling to improve rigor and decrease contact) that not only improve the risk benefit ratio but will likely lead to a reimagination of the future of TMS delivery-perhaps even launching a new industry that merges the portability and affordability of tDCS devices with the benefits of electromagnetic induction as a mechanism of inciting brain change.",

However, precipitated psychological responses might progress into severe mental concerns which can easily outlast the pandemic. Sleep disturbances, somatization, stress-related illnesses, post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and health risk behaviors such as social isolation, substance abuse or suicide attempts might also surge [2, 102, 104]. Accordingly, depressive and post-traumatic symptoms have been constantly reported and found to persist even 2.5 years after epidemics [105]. Evidence that similar symptoms are present among health care professionals and the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak is already emerging from China, the epicenter of the outbreak [103, [106], [107], [108]], and from Europe as well [109].",

The administration of magnetic fields (i.e. TMS) or weak electrical currents (i.e. tES) induces long-term neuronal effects through modulating neuroplasticity [117]. One of the first and most successful areas of NIBS application is the use of HF-TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to alleviate depressive symptoms that now has a level A evidence (i.e. definite efficacy) [4]. Interestingly, promising results are emerging regarding the beneficial effects of NIBS on several clinical populations suggesting transdiagnostic opportunities. Level B (probable efficacy) recommendation has been proposed for the use of TMS in fibromyalgia, PD, MS, PTSD and stroke [5]. Evidence is less conclusive on tES; however, level B evidence supports the utility of tDCS in depression, chronic pain and fibromyalgia [6]. Moreover, prosperous results suggest the potential efficacy of NIBS in several other disorders e.g. in anxiety disorders [118], dementia [119], obsessive-compulsive disorder [120, 121] and pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [122].",

Cognitive control is impaired in several conditions [114, 123]; however, NIBS has successfully ameliorated cognitive impairment in different patient groups [[123], [124], [125]]. Another important skill, emotion regulation has improved in patients with anxiety disorders with the effects being sustained for 3 months after TMS [126]. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and PTSD emerging or being accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic [102] might also be successfully mitigated with NIBS based on previous research [4, 127, 128]. Furthermore, stress is also known to exacerbate disease-related symptoms such as the motor symptoms of patients with tic disorders or PD [114, 129, 130]. Preliminary evidence indicates the beneficial effects of TMS on motor performance as well [131, 132].",

Neurological symptoms such as impaired consciousness, headache, dizziness and taste or smell impairment are not uncommon [134]. Therefore, the long-term follow-up and monitoring of severe cases of COVID-19 in terms of neurological symptoms is highly advised [135]. Through the enhancement of neural plasticity, some COVID-19-related neurological residual symptoms might be attenuated by NIBS. In a rat model, TMS has been found to reduce inflammation after focal brain injury [136] and to decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with PD [137]. Moreover, patients with disorders of consciousness have shown neurobehavioral and electrophysiological gains after multiple sessions of NIBS [[138], [139], [140]]. Therefore, anti-inflammatory potential and neurological utilization of NIBS might also be investigated.",

This could span changing methods and access to prescribed medications (e.g. ability to diagnose, monitor for adverse events) as well as any consideration of unexpected interactions between drugs (e.g. psychotropics) and antiviral medication. A general feature of NIBS is its non-drug non-systematic application nature, non-addictive nature, and ability to terminate or adjust dose (in clinic or remote for home-based treatment) and vice versa. Clearly, there is potential for NIBS as a unique treatment tool in the fight against the medical and psychological after-effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

The degree of interruption varied; for example, in-person non-clinical (non-essential) work was largely halted while remote-tDCS clinical activity continued. Interruption of ongoing trials is compounded by overall operational and programmatic uncertainties e.g. the situation of students and early career scientists, financial concerns. The overarching concern is when and how specific clinical and laboratory work can be resumed and what precautions are to be adopted.

As we have discussed above, expanding clinical trials with telemedicine-based NIBS are of high impact in the current situation and considering future outbreaks and longstanding need for vigilance. Since tES devices are more easily transportable and simple to use, the remote application of tES is more supported in contrast to TMS. Guidelines [46, 56] and empirical experience [[140], [141], [142]] regarding the at-home applications of tDCS are available.
