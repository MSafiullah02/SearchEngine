            "text": "Epidemiological studies reveal that coronary heart diseases caused by atherosclerosis, including myocardial infarction and other forms of ischemic heart disease, are major causes of death worldwide [1]. If coronary blood flow is impaired by the development of atherosclerosis, interventions such as balloon angioplasty and endovascular stent placement are employed to overcome the vascular occlusion. These interventions can produce mechanical damage to the vasculature, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and the adventitia [2\u20134]. Destruction of the endothelial cell layer is observed in the early phase after these interventions, with the formation of a thin thrombus layer covering the vascular surface [5]. Within several weeks, the vascular endothelial cells completely cover the neointima. Endothelial injury causes recruitment and adherence of circulating leucocytes, which results in the progression of neointimal formation [6]. The extent of neointimal formation has been reported to be correlated with the number of macrophages in the neointima [7]. Macrophages and neutrophils enhance the inflammatory response through the release of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [5]. Human studies have shown the existence of a correlation between chronic inflammation after stent placement and intimal thickening [7]. The release of the aforementioned growth factors and cytokines by the injured endothelium and infiltrating inflammatory cells leads to SMC migration and proliferation, which is preceded by transition of the SMCs from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the intima [8, 9]. Although remarkable technological advances have been made in the treatment of coronary heart disease, none of the available treatments up to date can sufficiently suppress atherosclerosis or entirely prevent restenosis after angioplasty [10\u201312]. Although in-stent restenosis can be alleviated by the use of drug-eluting stents, a number of cases treated with drug-eluting stents are still reported to develop restenosis [13, 14]. There also remains the question of the safety of drug-eluting stents, including in relation to the higher frequency of occurrence of thrombotic events observed with the use of drug-eluting stents as compared to bare-metal stents [15, 16]. Moreover, cases with neointimal hyperplasia occurring after bypass surgery or allograft cardiac transplantation cannot be treated with drug-eluting stents [17, 18]. Thus, a more precise understanding of the mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia will provide the development of new technologies. In this review, we discuss our experience in generating mouse models of cuff-induced injury of the femoral artery and attempt to provide a better understanding of cuff-induced neointimal formation.",

            "text": "Many previous studies have reported rabbit models of cuff-induced injury. Two types of materials have been used for the generation of these rabbit models, a polyethylene tube and a silastic tube. In 1969, Mizukawa et al. have reported neointimal formation induced by the insertion of a polyethylene tube in the rabbit carotid artery [19]. Histological analysis revealed that the neointima was composed of SMCs, but had no other characteristics of atherosclerosis, e.g., foam cells [20\u201322]. Importantly, the polyethylene tube produced only mild, not severe, injury of the endothelial cells. Hirosumi et al. carried out an in-depth investigation of the morphometric changes induced in an artery by the insertion of a polyethylene tube by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy (1.5 cm long PE-280; inner diameter, 2.15 mm; outer diameter, 3.25 mm; Becton, Dickinson and Company) [23]. At 30 min after cuff placement, small endothelial defects and adherence of a small number of platelets were observed in the subendothelium. At 2 h, a number of leukocytes were recruited to this cuff-injured area. The endothelial defects increased for 24 h, and leukocytic infiltration of the internal elastic lamina and endothelial cells was observed. After the 3rd day, regeneration of spindle-shaped endothelial cells occurred and covered the exposed subendothelium. However, the leukocytic infiltration persisted. The internal elastic laminae were irregular, swollen, and wavy. The SMCs under these laminae were markedly deformed and edematous. Although the endothelial cells became flat after 1 week, gaps were often observed at the cell junctions. Light microscopy revealed regression of the edematous media and SMC-like intimal cell proliferation. After 2 weeks, the endothelial cells completely covered the subendothelium, and the gaps between the cells acquired normal tightness. Leukocytes were no longer seen at the endothelial surface. On the other hand, Booth et al. were the first to use a biologically inert soft and flexible Silastic cuff, 2.1 cm length with an internal volume of 0.3 cm3 in the carotid artery of a New Zealand White male rabbit [24]. Neointimal formation consisted largely of SMC-like cells, similar to the case in the polyethylene cuff-induced injury. No foam cells were detected in any of the sections obtained from the carotid arteries of the New Zealand White rabbits at 7 days after the placement of the Silastic cuff. Moreover, an intact endothelial layer was observed after 7 days. The endothelial cells remained in contact with each other, and no denudation or exposure of the subendothelium was seen at 24 h after placement of the silastic cuff [25]. Kockx et al. revealed that silicone cuff-induced neointimal formation can be distinguished into three phases [26]. The first phase begins within 2 h, with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration from the luminal surface toward the intima and the inner media. In the second phase, which starts within 12 h, the replication rate of the SMCs in the media increases by about 20-fold as compared with that in unmanipulated arteries. The third phase, beginning from day 3, is characterized by the appearance of subendothelial SMCs that are immunoreactive for \u03b1-SM actin (\u03b1-SMA). Although the neointima formed in response to both injury caused by a polyethylene and that caused by a silastic cuff consists of SMCs, the injury caused by the polyethylene cuff was associated with injury of the endothelial cells, whereas that caused by the silastic cuff was devoid of injury to the endothelium.",

            "text": "Mouse models have been used popularly as experimental animal models due to their well-defined genetic background and the possibility of manipulating the mouse genome. Mouse models are useful for evaluating the roles of specific molecules in vascular remodeling, such as in the case of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) restenosis. Apolipoprotein (Apo) E-knockout (KO) mice have been used extensively because they develop spontaneous atherosclerosis [27, 28]. Furthermore, the atherosclerotic lesions in this mouse model closely resemble the atherosclerotic lesions, both stable and unstable, in humans. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) R-KO mice also serve as good models to evaluate human atherosclerotic lesions [29]. However, unlike the ApoE-KO mice, the LDLR-KO mice do not develop spontaneous atherosclerosis [28]. Both ApoE-KO and LDLR-KO mice have also been utilized to generate other relevant mouse models of cardiovascular disease through a variety of breeding strategies. Although these mice are effective tools for the investigation of atherosclerosis, development of a progressive atherosclerotic lesion takes a long time, resulting in an increase of both the costs and the space for the research. Mouse arteries, unlike the arteries of larger animals, are too small for transluminal injury to be induced with a balloon. Thus, it is necessary to develop tools for easier evaluation of atherosclerosis in mouse models.",

            "text": "Three methods for the induction of neointimal formation in mice have been mainly reported [10]. In the arterial ligation model, blood flow through the common carotid artery is disrupted by ligation near the distal bifurcation [30]. The decrease in the blood flow resulting from the dramatic reduction of the vessel diameter results in the formation of an extensive SMC-rich neointima within 2\u20134 weeks. This model has the advantage of reproducibility due to the ease of use of the method for inducing neointimal hyperplasia. Lindner and colleagues were the first to report mechanically induced endothelial denudation model, which involves passage of a flexible guidewire three times in the carotid artery [31]. This procedure completely removes the endothelial cell layer, which results in the recruitment of platelets to the denuded surface and activation of the medial SMCs. Neointimal hyperplasia is typically observed within 2 weeks after the injury. This procedure is the most similar to angioplasty. However, this procedure is a relatively challenging procedure, which leads to difficulty in achieving reproducible results. Subsequently, Sata et al. modified the wire injury method to develop a more convenient and reproducible results [32]. Since the wire injury model shows complete denudation of the endothelial cell layer, it may not be suitable for investigation of the involvement of endothelial cell-specific molecules in the development of atherosclerosis. Use of a polyethylene cuff also causes damage to the endothelial cell layer as described above, but it produces milder injury as compared to wire injury. The endothelium itself is not directly injured by a polyethylene cuff. In fact, endothelial cells have reported to remain relatively intact after perivascular cuff placement [33]. Moroi et al. first adapted an external vascular cuff model used in rabbits to mice deleted with endothelial cell-specific eNOS gene [34]. Since the virus-mediated vector and drug can be injected easily between the cuff and the vessel, this cuff-induced injury model is also excellent for the observation of changes in the adventitia associated with arteriosclerosis [35]. Thus, the use of mouse models of cuff-induced injury has increased in recent years.",

Before the operation, the cuff (Intramedic Polyethylene Tubing (PE-50, inner diameter = 0.58 mm), Becton Dickinson) needs to be prepared. Polyethylene tube was cut for each length 2 mm and cut in longitudinal direction. We tied polyethylene tube directly to 8\u20130 nylon suture with needle (Bear Medic Corporation) in two places on both side and made stringlike. The mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sodium pentobarbital at the dose of 40\u201350 mg/kg. Then, the mice were fixed in the supine position and their skin was shaved from the inguinal region to the medial aspect of the thigh above the knee and disinfected with 70 % ethanol. The skin was next lifted with tweezers under stereomicroscopic observation, and an incision about 7\u201310 mm length was placed in the inguinal region. The subcutaneous connective tissue was carefully removed to expose both the femoral artery and the femoral vein. The femoral artery is separated from the femoral vein by blunt dissection with micro tweezers. A stringlike nylon suture with polyethylene tube is sent under a separating femoral artery. The break of the polyethylene tube is expanded by pulling stringlike nylon suture of polyethylene tube. The polyethylene tube is placed around the femoral artery. Finally, the surrounding tissue is straightened and the skin is sutured (Fig. 2.1). A sham operation is performed without polyethylene tube placement in the other femoral artery, as control. The mice are anesthetized by IP injection of pentobarbital 14 days after the operation and fix in the supine position. After laparotomy, the diaphragm is incised to expose the heart. Ice-cold 4 % paraformaldehyde is injected into the systemic circulation via the cardiac apex at a pressure of 100 cm H2O, followed by incision of the right auricular appendage. Both the cuffed-femoral artery and the sham-operated artery of the opposite sides are removed and immersed in OCT compound. For the immunohistochemical staining, 5- to 6-\u03bcm-thick sections are prepared from each sample. Paraffin sections are more suitable for the measurement of intimal thickness than frozen sections. Femoral artery samples embedded in paraffin were cut from one edge to the other edge of the cuffed portion. The areas of the lumen, intima, and media were measured in 10 cross sections using the image analyzer. Images are digitized and captured with a CCD camera connected to a personal computer (Fig. 2.2a). Measurements are performed at a magnification of \u00d7200 using the Scion Image analysis software. For each artery, the luminal area, area inside the internal elastic lamina, and the area encircled by the external elastic lamina are measured. The medial area is calculated as the area encircled by the external elastic lamina area inside the internal elastic lamina, and the intimal area is calculated as the area inside the internal elastic lamina-luminal area. To calculate the medial thickness for each vessel cross section, the linear distance between the internal elastic lamina and external elastic lamina is measured independently in 10 places, separated by 90\u00b0 each and then averaged. The ratio of the intimal to the medial area and the percent luminal stenosis are calculated based on these measurements [10, 34].\n\n",

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, which is mainly secreted from platelets, is one of the most potent factors inducing migration and proliferation of the SMCs after balloon angioplasty. The expression levels of PDGF-BB mRNA in the cuffed artery were significantly increased as compared to those in the sham-operated artery (Fig. 2.3). An antagonist of the PDGF-BB receptor was shown to suppress the proliferation of vascular SMCs after balloon-induced injury in a rat model [36]. PDGF-BB induces vascular SMC proliferation via, at least in part, regulation of the cell cycle. Schwaiberger et al. demonstrated that local treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor inhibited cuff-induced neointimal formation, accompanied by reduction of the phosphorylation level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), but not of Akt, ERK1/2, or p38MAPK activation [35]. These data suggest that PDGF-BB-STAT3 signaling is involved in cuff-induced neointimal formation.",

In in vitro experiments, the secreted soluble form of LR11 (soILR11) promoted the migration of THP-1 induced by PDGF-BB, an effect that was completely canceled by the anti-uPAR antibody [38].

Mice overexpressing the murine HAS2 gene specifically in the vascular SMCs (cHAS2/CreSM22a mice) showed markedly enhanced cuff-induced neointimal formation, with augmentation of SMC migration and proliferation, and production of inflammatory cytokines and ROS [39]. Consistent with these data, in a wire-induced injury model, a HA synthesis inhibitor markedly suppressed neointimal formation.

Two weeks after cuff placement following a high-fat diet for 4 weeks, atherosclerotic lesions developing in the intima predominantly consisted of a massive accumulation of foam cells with a number of \u03b1-SMA- and GFP-positive cells. In addition to macrophages, adventitial small vessels also showed positive staining for both the endothelium-specific marker CD31 and GFP in mice transplanted with BM obtained from GFP-transgenic mice [41]. Most of the macrophages are GFP-positive, and some of the SMCs and ECs are also GFP-positive. In a cuff-induced vascular injury model, BM-derived cells are recruited to the adventitia and differentiate into macrophages, SMCs, and endothelial cells. Treatment with a blocker of M-CSF, which guides differentiation into macrophages, caused a prominent decrease of macrophages, and inhibition of the PDGF receptor suppressed the recruitment of SMCs to the adventitia after cuff placement [42]. These data suggest that the adventitia plays a pivotal role in neointimal formation induced by cuff placement. Scott et al. demonstrated that the adventitia is important in the first wave of growth after angioplasty following occurrence of neointimal hyperplasia [43].",

Rag-1-KO mice, which lack mature B and T cells, have been demonstrated to show increased thickness of cuff-induced neointima in the carotid artery. Reconstitution of the Rag-1-KO mice with B cells from WT mice reduced the neointimal formation. Moreover, both IgG and IgM were detected in the cuff-injured carotid arteries of reconstituted Rag-1-KO mice with B cells [45]. These data suggest that an increase of immunoglobulin by activation of B cells exerts a protective action against intimal thickening. The neointimal area and intima/media ratio were significantly reduced in mice treated with immunoglobulin administered intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days starting 1 day prior to cuff placement. On the other hand, immunoglobulin could not suppress cuff-induced neointimal formation, when the treatment was commenced 3 days after cuff placement [46]. When pooled mouse IgG or IgM was given to Rag-1-KO mice by intravenous injection, a significant reduction of intimal thickening was observed as compared with that in the untreated Rag-1-KO mice. Immunoglobulin treatments modify the serum complement C3 profile, and the amount of complement C3 was decreased in the injured arteries. Depletion of complement C3 in the Rag-1-KO mice significantly decreased the degree of intimal thickening [47]. These data suggest that IgG, IgM, and complement C3 are involved in the modulation of the neointimal hyperplasia response to cuff-induced injury.",

Rag-1-KO mice given CD8+ T cells showed a significant decrease of neointimal formation as compared to Rag-1-KO mice not given the cells. On the other hand, transfer of CD4+ T cells was not associated with inhibition of the neointimal formation [49]. Neointimal formation induced by cuff placement was significantly reduced in CD4-KO mice as compared with that in the WT mice, because of the higher percentage of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, adoptive transfer of CD8+CD28hi T cells into recipient Rag-1-KO mice significantly reduced neointimal formation as compared to that of CD8+CD28+ T cells [50].

The second isoform is inducible NOS (iNOS), which cannot be detected in normal tissue, but is expressed in several cell types, including macrophages and vascular SMCs, after cytokine stimulation [54], and the third isoform is neuronal NOS (nNOS), which is constitutively expressed mainly in the nervous tissues and skeletal muscle type II.",

Since antiplatelet and antihypertensive treatments cannot attenuate the progression of neointimal formation, the neointimal hyperplasia observed in eNOS-KO mice is produced by the direct action of eNOS and not mediated by thrombus formation or high blood pressure [33]. When adenovirus-mediated human endothelial constitutive NOS cDNA (AdCMVceNOS) was transduced into the rat carotid artery after balloon injury, the intima/media ratio decreased significantly because of inhibition of SMC proliferation [56].

Unlike eNOS-deficient mice, iNOS-KO mice showed no reduction of the neointimal hyperplasia associated with mechanically induced endothelial denudation. Both the medial area and medial thickness were increased in the iNOS-KO mice after mechanically induced endothelial denudation [60]. Consistent with these data, Yogo et al. demonstrated that vascular remodeling, but not neointimal hyperplasia, after carotid artery ligation was increased in the iNOS-KO mice [55]. The differences in the procedure used to induce vascular injury may be related to the degree of neointimal hyperplasia and vascular remodeling in the iNOS-KO mice. Cuff placement evokes significant participation of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, in the adventitia as compared to the ligation model, as mentioned above. Increase of inflammation in the adventitia may be associated with increased iNOS expression levels, which may promote neointimal formation induced by cuff placement. Mechanically induced endothelial denudation and ligation may mainly induce migration of the SMCs from the media to the intima, resulting in increased neointimal hyperplasia.",

Tlr4 serves as the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and also recognizes cellular fibronectin, heat shock protein 60, and endogenous peptides that are produced in response to tissue injury [63]. In the adventitia, not all Tlr4-positive cells are colocalized with macrophages. Although application of LPS between the cuff and artery augmented the neointimal formation induced by cuff-induced injury in the WT mice, no such finding was observed in the Tlr4-KO mice [64]. Application of Pam3Cys-SK4, a synthetic Tlr2 ligand, significantly enhanced the neointimal formation induced by cuff placement in the femoral arteries of the WT mice. No such increase of the neointimal formation was observed in the Tlr2-KO mice. In ApoE-KO mice, application of Pam3Cys-SK4 led to a significant increase in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques [65]. Tlr2 stimulation produced significant induction of inflammatory cytokines in human adventitial fibroblasts in vitro. Treatment with cathepsin K (CatK), which is one of the most potent of mammalian collagenases, increased the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, including Tlr2 and Tlr4. CatK-KO mice showed significantly reduced neointimal formation following cuff placement and ligation, accompanied by a decrease in the expression levels of Tlr2 and Tlr4 mRNA [66]. These findings provide evidence for a link between inflammatory cytokines in the adventitia and intimal lesion formation.",

Blockade of Tlr7/9 with a dual antagonist reduced neointimal thickening and foam cell accumulation; the intima/media ratio was reduced by 64.5 % and luminal stenosis by 62.8 %. Application of the Tlr7/9 dual antagonist also reduced arterial wall inflammation, with reduced macrophage infiltration and altered serum IL-10 levels. Stimulation of cultured macrophages with Tlr7/9 ligands enhanced TNF\u03b1 expression, which was decreased by coadministration of the Tlr7/9 antagonist. Furthermore, the antagonist abolished the Tlr7/9-enhanced LDL uptake.

Specifically, modulation of the local RAAS may play a key role, just like that of the systemic RAS, in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin (Ang) II is a peptide that exerts potent vasoconstrictive action via the AT1 receptor-MAPK pathway. Although human renin (hRN)/human angiotensinogen (hANG)-transgenic (Tg) mice showed increased blood pressure and medial thickening even in the absence of cuff placement, the hRN/hANG-Tg mice showed even more pronounced inflammatory vascular remodeling after cuff placement. Treatment with an AT1 blocker inhibited cuff-induced neointimal formation associated with reduced inflammation, but independently of the blood pressure change [71]. When the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren was administered to C57BL/6 mice via an osmotic pump, it inhibited cuff-induced vascular remodeling. The number of adherent leukocytes was increased in the cuff-injured mice not treated with aliskiren, where it was significantly reduced in the aliskiren-treated mice without any change of the blood pressure. Aliskiren decreased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to TNF\u03b1-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells [72]. These data indicate that RAS activation augments neointimal hyperplasia induced by cuff placement via increased release of inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "Recently, in addition to the Ang II-AT1 receptor pathway, Ang-(1-7), which is synthesized from Ang I and Ang II mainly via ACE2 activity, has been reported to play a crucial role in vascular remodeling via Mas receptor activation [76, 77]. Mas-KO mice showed markedly increased neointimal formation after cuff placement, independently of the AT1 receptor. Treatment with Ang-(1-7) also suppressed neointimal formation, associated with suppression of vascular SMC proliferation, release of inflammatory cytokines and superoxide anion production in the injured artery. On the other hand, these inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7) were less marked in the Mas-KO [78]. Interestingly, treatment with an AT1 receptor blocker inhibited neointimal formation induced by cuff placement, accompanied by a decrease in the expression levels of ACE2 and Mas mRNA and an increase in the expression of AT2 receptor mRNA. AT2 receptor-KO mice showed no reduction of the neointimal formation by treatment with Ang-(1-7). These results suggest that in addition to the activities of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, blockade of the AT1 receptor could enhance the activities of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/AT2 receptor axis and thereby inhibit neointimal formation induced by cuff placement.",

Insulin resistance is caused by impaired insulin signaling induced by some factors. Insulin activates insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2, which are expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, including the endothelial cells and SMCs, through the insulin receptor and the downstream signaling [84]. Both IRS1- and IRS2-KO mice show features of the metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Although both genotypes of mice show a similar degree of insulin resistance, the IRS2-KO mice show more pronounced cuff-induced neointimal formation than the IRS1-KO mice, which in turn show more pronounced cuff-induced neointimal formation than the WT mice. IRS2 expression, but not IRS1 expression, is detected in the blood vessels [85]. Insulin resistance in the blood vessels is considered to exacerbate cuff-induced neointimal formation.",

AdPTEN reduced SMC proliferation and release of inflammatory cytokines [86]. Since insulin activates PI3K via the IRS, the overexpression of PTEN in response to cuff-induced injury appears to be a seemingly contradictory finding to that observed in the IRS-KO mice.
