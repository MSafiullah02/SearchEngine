Previously, Yeh et al. had studied the molecular epidemiology of SARS infection in Taiwan and had concluded that the origin of the Taiwanese SARS epidemic was mainly either Hong Kong or Guangdong, rather than Beijing [11] ; in addition, they found that the SARS-CoV isolated from the younger brother (i.e., patient TWC) of the visitor from Hong Kong was not clustered with other isolates from hospital HP [11, 12] . Because a complete genome sequence from the nasopharyngeal aspirate from patient TWC (strain TC1) was available, we decided to reexamine both (1) the source of infection at hospital HP and (2) the paths of dissemination of SARS among hospitals in Taiwan.",

Furthermore, the genotype with the T:T:T:T SNVs has been associated with infections originating in Hotel M in Hong Kong [8, 17] . Currently, phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV require complete genome sequences [5, 11, 17] ; however, because of the 10 December Laboratory-contamination accident limited number of specimens available for complete genome sequencing, some researchers have used the SARS-CoV spike gene for this purpose; but most results have been less than satisfactory [18, 19] . Therefore, the objectives of the present study were (1) to use 20 complete SARS-CoV sequences to combine several variable regions of a SARS-CoV for phylogenetic analysis, in order to develop a simpler tool; (2) to use a different set of sequences from 80 SARS-CoV isolates to validate the method, by 3 different phylogenetic analytical methods; and (3) to apply this proposed tool to elucidate the origin and paths of dissemination of SARS-CoV infections, on the basis of samples collected from hospitals in Taiwan.",

Because SARS is an acute infectious disease, the odds that it will be contracted from 2 subgroups are very low. Furthermore, the strategy of combining different genomic regions for phylogenetic analysis has been used in molecular epidemiological investigations of the origins of HIV-2. In those studies, the evolutionary history of a simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV-2 lineage was reconstructed by use of a combination of partial gag and env sequences; the method increased the accuracy of the phylogenetic analysis [28] . It is noteworthy that the SimPlot analysis demonstrated that the 3 region of the viral genome, especially near the junction of replicase 1b and the spike genes (encoding protein S), had the greatest sequence variation (figure 2). The S protein is considered to be the most important target for the humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV [15, 16] .",

In terms of robustness, a bootstrap value of 70% is often cited as a cutoff for a reliable cluster [25] . Although the bootstrap values for nodes a and b in the NJ and Pars trees generated by the conventional method were higher than those in the NJ and Pars trees generated by the proposed method, the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the bootstrap values for node c in the Pars trees generated by the conventional and proposed methods were 56% and 67%, respectively, and the corrresponding bootstrap values in the NJ trees were 63% and 66%. This finding was confirmed by the ML trees: the P value for node c in the tree generated by the conventional method was not statistically significant, and that for node c in the tree generated by the proposed method was !.01. Accordingly, the tree generated by the proposed method was more reliable; also, because the proposed method requires only 7 RT-PCR reactions to perform the analysis, it is less time-consuming and more efficient than the conventional method. To facilitate other laboratories' future molecular epidemiological studies of outbreaks of SARS, we have made the nucleotide-sequence-alignment file of 80 SARS-CoV reference strains available on our center's Web site (http://www .ym.edu.tw/aids/Molepi/).",

The first and second waves were in different phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that they had different origins. Although both the second and the third waves were in the B2 cluster, the SARS-CoV isolates in the third wave had their own nucleotide-signature pattern (figure 5). Neither the first wave nor the second wave led to serious outbreaks, but the third waveoriginating with a resident of Amoy Gardens who visited Tai- wan-led to 1 transmission on a train (strain TWC3), 1 case of transmission between family members (strain TC1), and nosocomial infections in at least 2 hospitals (HP and GD) in northern Taiwan. Only 1 nucleotide difference between strains TC1 and TWC3 was noted ( figure 5 ). In addition, strain TWC3 and an Amoy Gardens strain, CUHK-AG01, shared an identical sequence, even though the woman who was the source of the isolate of strain TWC3 never left Taiwan at any time during the epidemic. An epidemiological investigation showed that the visitor from Amoy Gardens and this woman sat in different cars during the train ride. Because this is the first documented case in which there is molecular proof of transmission on a train, it raises the question of why only 1 passenger contracted the infection. Because it has been reported that SARS appears to be most infectious at 6-11 days after onset of illness and not during the first day of symptoms [29] , we assumed that the visitor from Amoy Gardens was not highly infectious during the train ride, even though he developed symptoms during the same evening that he traveled from Taipei to Taichung.",

In addition, there was a 7-nt difference between TWC and TC1 ( figure 5 ). If we assume that strain CUHK-AG01 represents the first-generation SARS-CoV in the transmission link, then both strain TC1 and strain TWC3 were the second-generation, and TWH was the thirdgeneration. According to the SNV-based analysis (figure 5), the number of nucleotide changes in the SARS-CoV genome per number of intermediate hosts was extremely low (!1 nt change/host). Because it has also been shown that no or very limited nucleotide changes occur in SARS-CoV sequences from either cultures or primary clinical specimens [11, 30] , we can tentatively conclude that strain TWC is a laboratory contaminant and did not originate from patient TC1.",

The epidemiological investigations also support this hypothesis: TW-PH1, a patient with SARS who was treated at hospital JC went to Kaohsiung City and received treatment at hospital KC, and, after being treated at hospital KC (table 1) , went back to Penghu Island and was hospitalized in hospital PH, where he transmitted the disease to other health-care workers. As shown in figure 6 , after combining the epidemiological data with the results of our phylogenetic-tree analysis, we conclude that the fourth wave of epidemic SARS infection progressed in 2 dissemination paths: the first path was from hospital JC to hospital KC in Kaohsiung and then to hospital PH on Penghu Island; the second path was from hospital JC to hospital GD and then to hospital YM. Two cases associated with community outbreaks in Taipei (strains TW10 and TW11) also belong to this cluster. With regard to the laboratory contamination, the laboratory researcher said that he had used SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849 for his experiment; however, our results indicate that the sequence in patient SCVJ is more closely related to that of strain TWC (figure 5). Because the researcher claimed that he had not obtained strain TWC from Taiwan's CDC and that he had used many clinical SARS-CoV strains besides HKU-39849, we are continuing our investigation to confirm both (1) whether the virus that he had obtained from Taiwan's CDC was in fact strain HKU-39849 or strain TWC and (2) which SARS-CoV strain that he handled was the source of the laboratory contamination. Because 130 imported SARS cases have been reported by Taiwan's CDC but have not yet been analyzed, we plan to use the proposed tool to conduct further analyses, in an attempt to identify their origins. These contact histories will provide valuable information for the control of future SARS infections.",
