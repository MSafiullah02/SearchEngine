Under scenario 3, the logistic regression models revealed that a high risk of positive test was significantly associated with older age (OR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93\u22120.98), diarrhea during hospital stage (OR, 10.44; 95% CI, 1.60\u221268.16).

We report that 15.7% of patients <50 years old showed positive tests, while 2.4% of patients >50 years old showed positive tests from anal swabs. The delay between discharge and RT-PCR result date was negatively associated among positive cases of throat swabs, with an adjusted OR of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.18\u22120.72).
