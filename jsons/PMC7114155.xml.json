Well known examples are the chronic viral infections caused by HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses, and the emergence of novel viral agents like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). This, together with the insufficient therapy options of today, has increased markedly the demand for new antiviral strategies. In this respect, a detailed understanding of the biology of a pathogenic virus including its interactions with host proteins at a molecular level is most helpful (Magden et al., 2005). As the cell biology and genetics of higher eukaryotes are highly complex, researchers have turned to the use of yeast as a simpler system to propagate viruses.",

More than 60% of the genes have an assigned function, while more than 40% share conserved sequences with at least one known or predicted human gene (Lander et al., 2001, Venter et al., 2001; www.yeastgenome.org). Due to the high conservation of fundamental biochemical pathways, yeast has been used as a model to unravel biological processes in higher eukaryotes (Mager and Winderickx, 2005). The studies of mRNA translation and mRNA degradation are just two examples to name (Coller and Parker, 2004, Donahue, 2000, Schwartz and Parker, 2000). These were possible because yeast is easy to grow in culture and to manipulate genetically. An additional experimentally valuable tool is a yeast library in which each non-essential gene is deleted. The collection is commercially available and covers around 85% of all yeast genes (Winzeler et al., 1999). It was used for multiple studies including genome-wide screenings for human disease genes and host factors that support virus replication (Kushner et al., 2003, Panavas et al., 2005b, Steinmetz et al., 2002).",

In addition, yeast has been used for drug discovery including the cellular pathways involved (Hughes, 2002, Lum et al., 2004). In basic research, yeast has assisted the elucidation of the function of individual proteins from important pathogenic viruses such as HIV, Hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (Blanco et al., 2003, DeMarini et al., 2003, Kapoor et al., 2005).

The genome of BMV consists of three 5\u2032 capped RNAs which have a tRNA-like structure at their 3\u2032ends (Ahlquist, 1992). RNA1 and RNA2 encode the essential RNA replication factors 1a and 2a, respectively. The 1a protein contains a C-terminal helicase-like domain and an N-terminal capping domain required for viral RNA capping in vivo (Ahola and Ahlquist, 1999, Garriga et al., 2004). 2a is the viral polymerase and contains a central RdRp domain. RNA3 encodes a cell-to-cell movement protein that enables the spread of infection between cells in the natural host. In addition, it encodes the capsid protein through a subgenomic RNA that is generated from an internal promoter in the negative-strand RNA3 replication intermediate.",

RNA3 has been introduced into yeast (i) by transfection of in vitro transcripts, (ii) by in vivo transcription from a yeast plasmid, or (iii) by in vivo transcription from a cDNA-based RNA3 launching cassette integrated into a yeast chromosome (Ishikawa et al., 1997a, Ishikawa et al., 1997b, Janda and Ahlquist, 1993). Most valuable for screening purposes has been the construction of RNA3 derivatives in which the coat gene was substituted with a reporter gene. Because its expression requires 1a-, 2a-directed negative-strand RNA3 and subgenomic mRNA synthesis, the reporter gene provides a screenable marker for viral replication (Ishikawa et al., 1997a, Ishikawa et al., 1997b, Kushner et al., 2003).",

Biochemical analysis and microscopy studies have shown that 1a induces the formation of vesicles in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (Schwartz et al., 2002). 1a protein specifically recruits both the BMV RNA and the 2a polymerase to these vesicles that serve as compartments for RNA replication (Chen et al., 2001, Chen and Ahlquist, 2000, Janda and Ahlquist, 1998). Interestingly their assembly, structure and function have similarities to the replicative cores of retroviruses and virions of double strand-RNA viruses (Schwartz et al., 2002). The domains of 1a and 2a, and the BMV RNA cis-signals involved in these processes have been thoroughly characterized (Ahola et al., 2000, Baumstark and Ahlquist, 2001, Chen et al., 2001, Chen and Ahlquist, 2000, den Boon et al., 2001, Sullivan and Ahlquist, 1999). Together, the obtained results explain many features of the replication of (+)RNA genomes and could help to shed light in parallel processes of other virus groups.",

A more global and systematic approach to identify host factors affecting viral RNA replication was the use of a diploid yeast deletion library for a genome-wide screening (Kushner et al., 2003). Each of the single gene deletion strains was transformed with plasmids expressing BMV 1a, 2a, and a BMV RNA3 replication template with a luciferase reporter gene replacing the coat gene. Hence, expression of luciferase was used as a screenable marker for BMV RNA replication. By this approach, approximately 4500 yeast deletion strains (\u223c80% of all yeast genes) were tested twice in two independent assays. Nearly 100 genes were identified whose absence either inhibited or stimulated BMV RNA replication and gene expression. They include (i) genes involved in RNA function or turnover, (ii) genes involved in membrane or lipid membrane synthesis and modification pathways, (iii) genes whose connection to BMV RNA replication is less evident and who function, for example, in protein turnover, glutathione synthesis, ubiquitin metabolism, tubulin folding or nitrogen utilization, and (iv) genes of as yet unknown function.",

These genes function in exosome-mediated 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 mRNA degradation and inhibit the accumulation of non-polyadenylated mRNAs, including those of the yeast dsRNA virus L-A (Araki et al., 2001).

Both yeast systems were simultaneously developed and use similar experimental approaches. The DI RNAs were in vivo transcribed from a yeast plasmid. The auxiliary and the polymerase ORFs were separately cloned and expressed from two additional plasmids. This was necessary because the read-through mechanism that generates the tombusvirus RNA polymerase does not work efficiently in yeast. Transformation of yeast with the three plasmids resulted in such a robust replication that the TBSV-derived DI RNA accumulated to ribosomal RNA levels as it does in plants (Panaviene et al., 2004, White and Nagy, 2004). The following findings derived from tombusvirus studies in yeast. As in plants, CIRV replicates in association with intracellular membranes of mitochondria whereas TBSV replicates at peroxisomal membranes (Panavas et al., 2005b, Rubino et al., 2000). The necessary molecular interactions between the auxiliary protein and the viral polymerase together with their association with the membranes have been characterized in detail (Panavas et al., 2005a, Pantaleo et al., 2004, Rajendran and Nagy, 2004; Weber-Lofti et al., 2002). In addition, four cis-acting RNA elements that are required for replication were also defined. The one localized within the RdRp ORF is specifically recognized by the auxiliary protein. This protein\u2013RNA interaction then results in the recruitment of the viral RNA to the replication complex (Pogany et al., 2005). The other three cis-acting viral RNA elements stimulate the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase and could be important to ensure fidelity of template selection during replication (Panaviene et al., 2005).",

Each strain of the collection was simultaneously transformed with two plasmids expressing the tombusvirus auxiliary and the RdRp proteins, respectively, and a third plasmid that directed the transcription of the DI-72 RNA replicon. Gene deletion effects were then detected by direct visualization of the TBSV DI RNA in ethidium-bromide-stained agarose gels. The screening experiment identified 96 host genes whose absence inhibited or stimulated TBSV replication, a number similar to the one from the BMV screening. As with BMV, the identified genes are involved in diverse cellular pathways including nucleic acid, protein and lipid metabolism, protein targeting and transport, and general and stress metabolism. Surprisingly, only four genes were found to be common in both studies, three of them function in the ubiquitin pathway (DOA4, LGE1, SIW14) and the fourth is a transcription regulator (CDC50). This number increases to fourteen when host genes with similar functions are considered. These genes are mainly involved in protein biosynthesis, protein metabolism and DNA remodeling. Interestingly, the TBSV-influencing host genes that were involved in protein targeting, membrane association, vesicle-mediated transport and lipid metabolism were not found in the BMV screening. This may relate to the fact that BMV and TBSV replicate in association with cellular membranes of different intracellular compartments. As a consequence, the transport of the replicase components and the assembly of the replication complex may be guided by different host factors.",

Since host factors may also influence this important mechanism of virus evolution, an analogous genome-wide screening experiment was performed to identify such factors (Serviene et al., 2005). As a read-out, TBSV DI RNAs were separated by agarose gels and characterized by Northern blotting. Recombinants were identified by length variation and further analyzed by sequencing. Five genes that suppress RNA recombination, four genes that increase RNA recombination and two that changed the profile of recombinants were identified. Four of the recombination suppressing genes are involved in mRNA degradation. The known functions of the other genes suggest that intracellular transport of viral or host proteins to the site of recombination and the lipid content of the replication compartment could have an effect on RNA recombination efficiency. While much of the mechanistic details have yet to be determined, these exciting findings open new avenues in the study of virus evolution.",

            "text": "Today, FHV and NoV are the only higher eukaryotic RNA viruses that are able to replicate their entire genomes in S. cerevisiae (Price et al., 1996, Price et al., 2005). Transfection of yeast with RNA isolated from FHV or NoV virions resulted in full viral RNA replication including the production of subgenomic RNA and, for FHV, the assembly of infectious virions. To facilitate the studies of the viral and host functions involved in nodavirus replication, yeast DNA plasmids were constructed to express RNA1 (Price et al., 2000, Price et al., 2005). After induced transcription, a robust replication is observed, comparable to the one in nodavirus-infected animal cells. For some studies it was useful to separate the replication template activity of RNA1 from its polymerase coding function (Lindenbach et al., 2002). This was achieved by generating FHV RNA1 derivatives that cannot express protein A. The RNA1 derivatives replicate when protein A is co-expressed in trans from a separate plasmid. These constructs were very valuable to define cis-acting elements in RNA1 that control RNA2 replication, as well as subgenomic RNA production (Lindenbach et al., 2002). Also they were used to show that protein A targets and anchors FHV RNA replication complexes to outer mitochondrial membranes through an N-proximal mitochondrial localization signal and transmembrane domain (Miller and Ahlquist, 2002). Interestingly, when the N-proximal mitochondrial localization signal of protein A is replaced by an endoplasmic reticulum localization signal, protein A and FHV replication complexes are targeted to the endoplamic reticulum and efficient replication takes place (Miller et al., 2003). These results suggest that at least for FHV no specific intracellular membranes are required for the formation and function of the viral RNA replication complex. For future studies, a more sophisticated system has been developed that allows visualization of FHV and NoV replication via reporter gene expression or selection by nutricional markers (Price et al., 2002, Price et al., 2005). Studies to gain a more detailed understanding in the nodavirus life cycle are in progress.",

While an impressive progress has been made to unravel many of the fundamental steps of replication, we are just standing at a beginning. Until today, all higher eukaryotic RNA viruses that have been described to replicate in yeast have relatively simple (+)RNA genomes with, for example, few viral proteins, no IRES elements and no need for proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins. This situation might be rapidly changing. Recently, internal initiation of translation mediated by the IRES of the Hepatitis C virus has been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (Rosenfeld and Racaniello, 2005). In addition, human proteins that are essential for virus replication but lack a functional counterpart in yeast may be expressed in yeast and thereby allow the development of more complex yeast/virus systems. This approach would be analogous to the so-called \u201chumanized yeast systems\u201d for studying mechanisms of human diseases like Huntington's and Parkinson's disease (Mager and Winderickx, 2005). Moreover, major advances in proteomics, metabolomics and genome-wide screening approaches in yeast are noteworthy. For example, the recently established yeast strains with increased membrane permeability and deleted major flux pumps will facilitate the entry of chemical compounds and thus the screening for antivirals in the yeast/virus systems. Taken together, the yeast S. cerevisiae will continue to provide interesting insights into the complex world of virus\u2013host interactions and keep us excitedly waiting for further pioneering findings.",

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the auxiliary protein (if required) are expressed from mRNA transcripts derived from two yeast plasmids by using inducible GAL1 or constitutive ADH1 yeast promoters. The expression of the two mRNA transcripts will generate the viral replicase. The replicative RNA is normally transcribed from a plasmid by using the inducible GAL1 promoter and contains a ribozyme sequence to generate authentic 3\u2032 ends. In some of the systems, the replicative RNA can also include a reporter gene, which expression is dependent on viral RNA replication. All yeast plasmids carry a selectable marker to allow stable expression. (B) Schematic illustration of common features of DNA virus replication in yeast. The full length circular DNA genomes are linked in cis to a selectable yeast marker gene. Alternatively, for BPV-1, the incubation of yeast protoplast with virions is enough to obtain viral replication and production of infectious BPV-1 particles.
