That review highlighted the extreme lack of available chemotherapeutics that show any inhibitory effects against the virus. In contrast, the emergence of numerous models and solved crystal structures of CHIKV proteins points to enormous possibilities for directed drug design. Notable among the available targets are the envelope proteins [12] [13] [14] [15] and the nonstructural proteins of CHIKV, which play an important role in the formation of the transcription/ replication complex of the virus [15, 16] . Among these, nsP3 is considered an attractive target for drug design because of its participation in the early stage of the transcription process of viral replication, even though the specific functions, roles, and activities of the nsP3 protein remain elusive [16, 17] .",

            "text": "To date, there have been relatively few studies on the functions, roles, and activities of alphavirus nsP3 proteins [11, [18] [19] [20] . Studies based on the Sindbis virus reported that nsP3 phosphoprotein is an essential component of the viral replication and transcription process. Functional analysis of the effects of mutations of nsP3 on RNA synthesis demonstrated that the mutations can cause a loss of capacity for minus-strand synthesis or a failure to increase plus-strand synthesis. Strikingly, a change in G4303 implying an alteration from Gly to Ala68 and leading to a modification to the His-Ala-Val peptide was predicted to form part of the active site of the conserved nsP3 macro domain [19] . However, no effect of the mutations on the ADP-ribose binding site was found [17] . The nsP3 protein consists of two domains, the Ndomain and the C-domain [16, 17] ; the N-domain is highly conserved but the C-domain is not [17] . The C-domain is phosphorylated at up to 16 positions on serines and threonines [11, 17] . The role of this phosphorylation is still not clear, but deleting the residues involved in the phosphorylation process can decrease the level of RNA synthesis [11, 17, 21] . The Ndomain, in which the region comprising the first 160 residues is called the X-domain or a macro domain, is commonly present in eukaryotic organisms, bacteria, archaea, and in many positive-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis E, rubella, coronaviruses, and alphaviruses [16] . The alphavirus macro domain has a highly positively charged patch on the surface of the protein at the crevice of the ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate active site and its periphery [17] . The other side of the protein, far from the active site, possesses a negative charge. Thus, the nsP3 macro domain is considered to complex with ADPribose derivatives and RNA. It is also believed to control the metabolism of ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate and/or other ADPribose derivatives with regulatory functions in the cell [11, 22] .",

            "text": "The crystal structure of the nsP3 macro domain of CHIKV was solved in 2010 [17] . The asymmetric unit of CHIKV includes four molecules. The macro domain consists of sixstranded \u03b2-sheets and four \u03b1-helices, and the positions of the \u03b1-helices are highly conserved. Also present is the ligand ADP-ribose, and the active site of the nsP3 macro domain is considered the binding site for this ADP-ribose ligand [16, 17] . This crevice is at the top of \u03b2-strands 2, 4, and 5 and is surrounded by two loops between \u03b22-\u03b11 and \u03b25-\u03b13. Since there is very little information available on the nsP3 macro domain and its inhibitor, the current study used computational approaches (including molecular docking and virtual screening) to discover potential compounds that inhibit nsP3 in CHIKV. Furthermore, in order to understand both the static structures and the dynamic information, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to gain a greater understanding of the behavior of nsP3 and how it changes upon the binding of small molecules. The results of the study were analyzed and compared with previous data to gain a deeper understanding of the atomic structure of the nsP3 macro domain and its complexes, as well as to confirm the interactions and results from docking.",

The ligand ADP-ribose was extracted from the complex crystal structure (PDB id: 3GPO), whereas other ligands employed for virtual screening were downloaded from the website of the Diversity Set II chemical library of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This library was selected as it contains diverse drug-like compounds, and potential hits can be ordered from the Open Chemical Repository Collection for activity testing. The protein was subsequently minimized by applying the CHARMM force field in the Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.0 software package [24] . The steepest-descent algorithm with 3,000 steps was used to relax the structure and remove steric overlaps. With a C\u03b1 RMSD of 0.59 \u00c5 between the minimized structure and the X-ray structure, the minimized structure was utilized for the docking process. Polar hydrogen atoms were added and the Kollman charges were defined with AutoDock Tools (version 1.5.4).",

In virtual screening, the location and the size of the grid box were carefully investigated via blind docking (in which the box is sufficiently large to cover the whole protein) and focused docking (in which a smaller box was centered on the potential binding site of interest). Blind docking can reveal potential binding sites in nsP3, but it can also suffer convergence problems during sampling. The MetaPocket program was also used to predict potential binding sites of nsP3 other than the active site [25] . After docking, the results were analyzed and compared with available experimental data. The top ten compounds (\"hits\") were identified according to their binding affinities using the default scoring function in Vina.

Among the top ten hits, four are shared between VST1 and VST2, which differ in the size of the grid box used. Given our interest in finding more inhibitors as well as other potential binding sites in the structure of nsP3, we used blind docking to dock into the entire protein, with the grid box centered on the middle of either the ADP-ribose binding site (VST3) or the protein (VST4). For the blind docking (VST3 and VST4), six of the top ten hits are common to VST3 and VST4, and the binding affinities were reproduced to within 1.0 kcal mol \u22121 . This indicates that the blind dockings are likely to have converged. The results show that most of the top ten hits fitted well in pocket 1, and this pocket can accommodate ligands of different sizes. However, ligands with bulky structures, such as NCI_293778, NCI_58052, and NCI_61610 (common to the top ten hits of both VST3 and VST4), protruded from the binding site. Table 1 Comparison of the hydrogen-bonding interactions inferred for the nsP3-ADP-ribose docked complex with previously published data. In [17] , key residues were identified by performing an experimental study of the crystal structures of the complex nsP3-ADP-ribose (3GPO), while the residues reported in [16] were determined by realizing molecular dynamics simulations of ADP-ribose in nsP3, based on the above crystal structures Furthermore, the other pockets surrounding pocket 1 may serve as alternative binding sites for potential inhibitors. By comparing the results from the blind dockings with the pockets predicted for nsP3 using MetaPocket, pockets 2 and 3 were identified, and focused docking at pockets 2 (VST5) and 3 (VST6) was conducted. Screening at VST5 and VST6 produced hits that had already been identified in previous screens, along with some new hits (Table S2 of the ESM). Pockets 1 and 3 share a number of interacting residues, including Asn24, Asp31, Val33, Gly112, Val113, and Tyr114. In contrast, pocket 2 was located on the opposite side and behind pocket 1, and comprised the residues His1, Pro2, Ser3, Tyr4, Met132, Asp133, Ser134, Thr135, Asp136, Ala137, Asp138, Val139, Arg159, Thr160, Ile156, and Gln157. The locations of the pockets in nsP3 and the locations of the different ligands in the three pockets are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 .

The locations of the three binding sites along with the top five compounds obtained from VST are displayed in detail in Fig. 3 (for more information, see Fig. S1 of the ESM). It is also interesting that the majority of the hit compounds show tighter binding in pocket 1 than in pocket 2. Detailed analyses of the interactions between the ligands and the protein target were carried out by characterizing the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts [34] . The results show that hydrogen-bonding interactions play a more important role in the binding to pocket 1, whereas hydrophobic contacts are responsible for the interactions associated with the binding to pocket 2. In agreement with this, it was previously reported [16] that the residues Ser110, Thr111, Gly112, and Tyr114 define pocket 1 and are key residues in interactions with ligands.

We can infer that the binding site at pocket 1, where NCI_61610, NCI_25457, and NCI_345647_a bind, is the most favorable place for ligands to form hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8 ). There are three strong hydrogen bonds between ligand NCI_61610 and the residues Asn24 (98 %), Tyr114 (92 %), and Gly112 (88 %) in pocket 1, but only one strong and one moderately strong hydrogen bond between NCI_670283 and Thr111 (78 %) and Gly112 (66 %) in pocket 2 (Fig. 7) . In contrast, pocket 3 is unlikely to be favored for binding, as no H-bonds with occupations of >10 % were identified. Furthermore, the residues in the region 110-114 of the protein are key residues that are responsible for forming the hydrogen bonds between the protein and the ligands in binding pockets 1 and 3. Most of them serve as hydrogen-bond donors, except in the complex nsP3-NCI_61610, where residue Thr111 serves as an acceptor. This observation is in close agreement with the results of earlier simulations and experimental data [16] . In addition, it emerged that the structures of NCI_61610 and NCI_345647_a are more polar than the other ligands, so more hydrogen bonds were found in complexes involving them than in complexes involving the other ligands.",

The solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) were calculated to monitor the possible changes in the solvation environment upon ligand binding (Table 5) . We expected to see that the SASA for hydrophobically interacting residues in the protein-ligand complex will decrease compared to those in the apoprotein.

These results are listed in Tables S3 and S4 of the ESM. The binding affinities observed in these docking runs (Table S3 of the ESM) were not significantly different from those obtained in previous dockings based on the X-ray structure. Additionally, the binding modes observed in the dockings based on the X-ray structure are similar to those obtained based on the MD sampled structures. Most of the top hits in the virtual screening were the same compounds as those identified in the previous screening, although there were some new hits too.

The present study is of great importance in relation to identifying novel inhibitors of the chikungunya virus. It is also the first to combine molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify potential inhibitors that target CHIKV by taking advantage of the recently determined high-resolution crystal structure of nsP3 in complex with ADP-ribose. Considering the presence of positive charge at the ADPribose-binding site, this binding pocket may have the tendency to accommodate negatively charged ligands, which may not have acceptable pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, we decided to identify all possible binding pockets based on the available methods. We first re-docked the ADP-ribose and successfully reproduced the bound structure and the key residues for interactions in the ADP-ribose-binding pocket. It was evident that the binding affinity of ADP-ribose was less than \u221210 kcal mol \u22121 , showing that this negatively charged ligand binds very tightly to nsP3. This study also demonstrates that the current docking protocol utilizing Autodock Vina is a robust approach for reproducing experimentally determined binding modes.",

In addition to the well-characterized adenine binding pocket (pocket 1), two additional binding pockets (pockets 2 and 3) were identified through blind docking and using MetaPocket. Pocket 3 partially overlapped with pocket 1, while pocket 2 was located on the opposite side of the protein (Fig. 3) . A comparison of the binding affinities at the three different binding pockets revealed that all of the hits for pocket 1 bind to the protein well, with binding affinities of less than \u221210 kcal mol \u22121 . This suggests that pocket 1 is the most favorable for ligand binding. In contrast, pocket 2 may not be a good location for binding compared to pockets 1 and 3 because it is associated with higher binding affinities. It is also interesting to note that some ligands were repeated multiple times in the list of virtual screening results. These ligands can bind to different pockets in different conformations (e.g., the ligand NCI_127133 binds to pockets 1 and 2, ligand NCI_670283 binds to pockets 1 and 3, and ligand NCI_293778 binds to pockets 1, 2, and 3). These ligands may therefore have greater potential for use as inhibitors. By analyzing the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the ligands and nsP3, key residues were identified. The region encompassing residues 110-114 was predicted to be the most important area for ligand interactions. This is consistent with the results of previous work by Rungrotmongkol et al. [16] .",
