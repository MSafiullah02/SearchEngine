            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral infection that has recently emerged in humans and causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality rate of 30\u201340% in average risk patients [1]. MERS is caused by a virus named MERS-CoV, which belongs to a large family of viruses called coronaviruses [2]. It was initially termed human (or novel) corona virus but was later changed to MERS-CoV [3]. Corona viruses are single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses that measure 120\u2013160 nanometers in diameter and are pleomorphic in shape [4]. In September 2012, the first case of MERS (the so called index case) was reported in Saudi Arabia and presented as symptoms of pneumonia and acute kidney injury [5]. Soon after, another patient from Qatar who had visited Saudi Arabia began experiencing acute respiratory symptoms and renal failure. The symptoms and type of viruses reported in these two patients were the same [6], [7]. The age of patients with MERS ranged from 9 months to 94 years, and the median age was 48 years [8]. Male patients constituted 64% of the total number of cases in non-health care worker patients [8]. Conversely, according to Balkhy et al., the median age of health care workers who got MERS during the outbreak from June to August 2015 was 37 years, and female workers constituted 77% of the total cases [9]. In addition, the mortality rate in the infected general population was higher and incomparable to the that of health care workers because they were younger, healthier, and with fewer comorbidities [9].",

Globally, one of the first large outbreaks that took place outside the Arabian Peninsula was in South Korea, which occurred between May and July 2015, and was followed by another outbreak in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia [15]. Based upon the recent outbreaks and the role of medical students in bringing awareness of MERS to the community, we aimed to assess the awareness of medical students studying in their clinical years to identify any gaps in their knowledge and to recommend any interventions to improve their awareness for better health education.",

Furthermore, the internet was the most common channel for obtaining health awareness regarding MERS for the general Saudi population [18]. However, their awareness regarding the number of new cases in August 2015 was not as expected.

This showed that respondents\u2019 knowledge of the basic sciences and technical details related to the virus was relatively lower in comparison to their knowledge in the clinical sciences, which could be due to a variety of different factors. First, a lack of basic science courses in their curriculum could explain their lack of awareness. Second, a lack of emphasis on this information in their clinical practice could also be another possible explanation. Moreover, in awareness campaigns directed to medical students, there was not enough coverage of these elements, which resulted in decreased awareness. Therefore, decreased awareness of the technical details of the virus is expected in medical students due to the abovementioned reasons. Because medical students are supposed to play a role as health advocates, they should thoroughly understand new medical events and obtain more in-depth knowledge regarding all aspects of the event, such as virus classification and the basic structure of the virus, than the general population to be able to raise awareness in their communities.",

Also, fifth year students had clinical rotations in infectious diseases when they studied Pediatrics and Medicine, whereas sixth year students did not have a similar clinical rotation.
