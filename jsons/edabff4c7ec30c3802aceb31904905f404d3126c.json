It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.",

As it was speculated that 2019-nCov originated from a single wild-animal which was traded at a busy marketplace [2] , the toll of infested people sharply arose in the city Wuhan, spreading to other Chinese cities and eventually becoming a global epidemic within merely a month. 2019-nCoV is found to be highly contagious via bodily droplets in air, the virus can live up to hours to two days when left over a contacted surface. Human-to-human transition has recently been detected, and the toll of the infested is rising up almost exponentially in this early stage. A global health emergency warning was issued by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020 [3] , designating that 2019-nCoV is of an urgent global concern. At the early stage, the morbidity mortality rates resulted from the infection of 2019-nCoV are uncertain [4] especially for young children and the senior aged groups. In order to control the wide and fast spread of the virus, authorities took pre-emptive measures to cordon off infested cities. Such measures include closing borders, suspending community services and schools, minimizing both domestic and international travels etc., until further notice. The purpose is to limit the chances of physical contacts among people, so to thwart the transmission of the novel virus.",

            "text": "The curfew imposed for China and other countries will cost huge economical loss increasingly every day. As this is a novel virus, its severity is unforeseen albeit its contagiousness is very strong and the incubation period is relatively longer than other virus, it is difficult for anybody to decide the optimal time of lifting the ban. Too soon should the ban be lifted; the epidemic may not have totally subsided; prolonged extension in constraining the societies will lead to heavier economical loss. Timing is very uncertain during this initial stage provided that the virus is novel, and we all have little knowledge about its characteristics. Authorities want to know when this epidemic may end, and whether it is continuing to get worse. Therefore, forecasting is extremely important even for the slightest clues for multi-attributes consideration over other societal and public health factors. In this case, just a forecast from any single model is not enough, the most reliable forecast is needed often from selection of several candidate models. In data mining this is a challenging computational problem [5] [6] -how to build a most accurate forecasting model with only a handful of training data available in the early stage? Three popular approaches of building prediction model from a small dataset are reported in the literature [7] [8] . One way is to expand the training dataset by augmenting additional data onto the available data [9] [10] . The second way [11] is to use an ensemble for collectively generating forecast results, and the forecast result from one of the several algorithms that has the lowest error is selected to use. The results from the rest of the candidates are discarded. The third approach [12] is to stay focus on a single prediction algorithm which often comes with several parameters to be adjusted. The accuracy level of the resultant model tends to be very sensitive to parameter setting. The default parameters values for such algorithm often do not provide the maximum performance, fine-tuning at the parameters values is required to improve the accuracy level.",

            "text": "As a methodology, GROOMS has three main processes. Firstly, the full dataset, however small it may be, is passed to a collection of candidate forecasting models. Secondly each candidate model will be tuned to its best performance by optimizing its parameters values or inclusion of data sources. In some special case of multiple regression, more than one data sources which are related to the prediction target are fed into the inputs of a multi-variable prediction model for reasoning. Neural network is one typical example. Depending on the characteristics of the forecasting model, which are roughly classified into three: non-parametric (e.g. linear regression, simple statistical inference) that requires no setting of model parameter; parametric model (e.g. choice of activation function, learning rate, for neural network, entropy, pruning option and splitting criteria for decision tree) in which the output performance is sensitive to the choice of the parameters values; and dual models whose performance is very sensitive to both choices of input sources and the model parameters setting. The steps and processes of GROOMS are shown in Fig. 1 . In GROOMS, the available small dataset is passed from top to down through optimization processes, preparing the candidate models for panel section. Taking the curve fitting error by a forecasting model as the prime performance indicator, the panel selection picks a winning model that has the lowest error. The prediction result from the winning model is hence considered as the best effort prediction out of what technically is available using simple desktop forecasting technology [13] . In general, there are five groups of data analytics pertaining to constructing a forecasting model. As shown in Fig. 2 , five groups embrace different types of algorithms and they have different complexity in the model designs [14] .",

PNN is mainly powered by idea of complicating a polynomial equation which grows a neural network with scaling up the powers of the polynomial coefficients until it can model the time series as fit as possible. As a result, the neural network would remain at marginal model complexity while its predictive ability is at its highest. PNN grows the network structure by self-tuning the model's coefficients (parameters) automatically through an iterative data sampling and controlled network expansion process. The network size is therefore increasing one iteration at a time. This is a typical non-linear optimization process between the inputs and the output of the network.

The rational is to observe and investigate how matching the curve fitting produced by these algorithms to the limited epidemic data at the early stage.

It belongs to Group 1 according to GROOMS, which allows inclusion and selection of multiple data sources other than the one that is being forecasted. A separate experiment is therefore conducted that tried several combinations of data sources; from there we observe which combo has the lowest error rates. Please refer to the results in Table I . By default, when all data sources are used together in the multiple regression, mediocre performance are obtained. It was found that, for both types of Combi and MIA architectures of PNN, this specific combination of data sources -suspected + confirmed + critical, when used together, superior performances are obtained. Intuitively, this is a natural sequence that resembles the lifecycle of an infested patient. An infection case that contributed to the national health records, started with somebody who displayed certain symptoms, hence a suspected case. After some diagnosis and test, the disease can be confirmed as coronavirus infection or something else. The patient received medical treatment; he may then turn critical that probably lead to fatality or cured. So, in order to forecast future suspected cases, the closely related status in sequence, that are confirmed and critical, could help. These three statuses form some kind of causality. They exist as a prerequisite for one to another to occur with high certainty. However, there exists a large uncertainty beyond the condition of critical at the moment, given that the virus is novel, its severity is not well-known, and the amount of available data is scarce. By the predicting powers of neural network, this uncertainty is reflected by the relatively higher RMSE on the right side of Table I. Since the winning model PNN+cf offers the lowest RMSE among all, its forecasting result is shown in Fig. 9 . If the data does not change (theoretically), the trend is forecast to dip down and the epidemic subsides. Of course, it is only a forecast as accurate as up to the current point of time, that is up to 4 Feb 2020. In this dynamic situation, the latest figures keep being updated daily, so does the forecast. Whenever new data comes in, it is highly likely that it will change the course of prediction, and a totally new outcome will be obtained which may be very different from the previous one. The future would unfold itself when time progresses. ",

From the perspective of data mining, the quest of finding the most accurate machine learning model while limited with very few data on hand to start about has attracted research attentions. In literature there are many bootstrapping and data augmentation methods for improving the performance of machine learning models. In this paper, a methodology called GROOMS is proposed which ensembles a collection of five types of forecasting methods, ranging from classical time-series forecasting, to self-evolving polynomial neural networks (PNN), to work together under a panel selector. In particular, our experiment has shown that PNN is superior in yielding a forecasting model with relatively lowest error. PNN is known to possess advantages in forming up a just fit model by incrementally growing its internal structure from simple to optimal. Therefore, overor under-fitting is less likely to happen. In this paper, PNN is extended to PNN+cf with corrective feedback in the optimization process. At the best efforts in optimizing the parameters, input data sources for multiple regression using GROOMS, it is shown the possibility and feasibility in finding the most accurate forecasting model based on the limited availability of data. Although the experiment demonstrated the possibility of picking a suitable forecasting model, forecasting is a dynamic task itself whose predicted result is very sensitive to the parameters used, the choice of model and the training data. Any addition or modification on the training data upon the arrival of new data, is likely to influence the course of the predicted result (as seen in Fig. 7 -the uptrend vs downtrend).",

From data mining viewpoint, it is vital to test more other popular algorithms for panel selection. Better still, it worth the efforts in probing in the underlying designs of some prominent algorithms and understanding why or why not it incur a very low or very high errors. With this insight discovered, one may formulate even new breed of algorithms from inside out, which handles well small data yet giving acceptable quality forecast. The methodology should be extended too. So far GROOMS was constructed in mind that the accuracy/error level is the sole criterion. In reality, pondering whether an epidemic is going to end or escalate is a complex and wide multi-factors decision. Based solely on historical data is only of one aspect of contributions to the decision, though it is still important. A more thorough methodology would be useful for connecting the technical forecast to other nontechnical decision-making processes. So, they can complement each other for making a multi-facet and reliable decision.",
