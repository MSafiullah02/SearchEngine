The HAdVs were detected using a respiratory virus panel fast assay (xTAG RVP FAST v2) and with a HAdV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction; their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Among 307 nasopharyngeal samples, 61 (19.9%) tested positive for HAdV. HAdV was the only virus detected in 31/61 (50.8%) cases, whereas it was found in association with one other virus in 25 (41.0%) cases and with two or more viruses in 5 (8.2%) cases. Human Enterovirus/human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common co-infecting viral agents and were found in 12 (19.7%) and 7 (11.5%) samples, respectively. Overall, the HAdV strain sequences analyzed were highly conserved. In comparison to HAdV-negative children, those infected with HAdV had a reduced frequency of lower respiratory tract involvement (36.1% vs 55.2%; p = 0.007), wheezing (0.0% vs 12.5%; p = 0.004), and hospitalization (27.9% vs 56.1%; p<0.001). Antibiotic therapy and white blood cell counts were more frequently prescribed (91.9% vs 57.1%; p = 0.04) and higher (17,244 \u00b1 7,737 vs 9,565 \u00b1 3,211 cells/\u03bcL; p = 0.04), respectively, in children infected by HAdV-C than among those infected by HAdV-B. On the contrary, those infected by HAdV-B had more frequently lower respiratory tract involvement (57.1% vs 29.7%) but difference did not reach statistical significant (p = 0.21). Children with high viral load were absent from child care attendance for a longer period of time (14.5 \u00b1 7.5 vs 5.5 \u00b1 3.2 days; p = 0.002) and had higher C reactive protein levels (41.3 \u00b1 78.5 vs 5.4 \u00b1 9.6 \u03bcg/dL; p = 0.03).

They belong to the family Adenoviridae, genus Mastadenovirus and are categorized into seven species (A-G) according to their biophysical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. Moreover, in each of these species, several types have been identified [1] . Species identity strongly correlates with antigenicity, epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations of HAdV infection, and in vitro response to some antiviral drugs [2, 3] . From a clinical point of view, species D (HAdV-D8, HAdV-D19, and HAdV-D37) is usually associated with the development of conjunctivitis; species F (HAdV-F40 and HAdV-F41) is usually associated with gastroenteritis; and species B (HAdV-B3 and HAdV-B7), C (HAdV-C1, HAdV-C2, and HAdV-C5), and E (HAdV-E4) are usually associated with respiratory diseases [2] . Recombination between members of the same species and between members of different species has been frequently described [4] . As a result, certain new types may acquire different pathogenicity and have strong potential for widespread and epidemic outbreaks. Consequently, surveillance of HAdV circulation with an early evaluation of the relationships between clinical manifestations and molecular characteristics of new infecting strains may be important for the development of adequate diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic measures against HAdV infection.",

In this study, similarly to what has been found in Asia by other authors [16] , a prevalence of approximately 20% was found, suggesting that the relevance of this infectious agent in the determination of respiratory problems could be higher than previously thought. The methods used to identify HAdVs might partially explain this finding. In the past, most of the epidemiological studies of viral respiratory infections were carried out using methods that could underestimate viral presence in respiratory secretions, such as viral culture, antigen detection by immunofluorescence, and visualization by electron microscopy [17] . To overcome this problem, molecular methods were suggested. Multiplex assays, including the RVP Fast v2 assay, were developed to obtain the simultaneous identification of all the most common respiratory viruses and are now commonly used in routine practice. As previously reported [8] and confirmed by this study, the RVP Fast v2 assay has poor sensitivity for HAdV and can lead to undervaluation of the real importance of these viruses in the determination of respiratory infections. The addition of a specific real-time PCR can solve this issue. Moreover, the higher than expected prevalence of HAdV infection evidenced by this study could be strictly related to the period during which it was carried out. Samples were collected in two winter months of two consecutive years. Although HAdVs circulate during the whole year, peak periods are in winter and early spring [1] . Consequently, it is possible that the study was carried out during epidemics leading to the higher prevalence values reported here.",

This is not surprising because, despite possible temporal and regional changes in predominant type [18] , these types are more commonly reported as the cause of respiratory infection worldwide. HAdV-B3 has been identified in successive outbreaks of severe acute respiratory illnesses in Korea [19, 20] , Brazil [21] , and Taiwan [22, 23] , where this virus was the predominant type for respiratory HAdV infection from 1981 to 2002. Moreover, together with other HAdV types, it has been the causative agent in epidemic outbreaks of respiratory diseases in Europe, America, and Oceania [24] [25] [26] . Finally, HAdV-B3 is known to be a causative agent of a characteristic syndrome of acute pharyngo-conjunctival fever in older children and adults, especially in summer camps and swimming pools [27] . Types C1 and C2 have been more frequently reported as the cause of endemic or sporadic cases [28] , although there have been reports of epidemics [19] . In Italy, a survey carried out approximately 10 years ago found that HAdV-C1 and -C2 were the most common HAdVs isolated in patients with infection due to these agents [28] . The same was shown by this study, showing that epidemics of infection due to the same HAdV in a given geographic area can be prolonged compared with outbreaks of RSV, parainfluenza virus, and influenza viruses, which are well defined and have duration limited to some months [29, 30] .",

Detection of HAdV in severely immunocompromised children has been implicated as a risk factor for poor outcome [31] . However, severe cases have been frequently described in otherwise healthy children [5, 19, 20] . In this study, most of the children with HAdV infection had a mild infection and, globally, the severity of respiratory infection of children in whom HAdV alone or in association with other respiratory viruses was identified was lower than that due to other infectious agents considered together. Both the prevalence of LRTIs and hospitalization rate were significantly lower in HAdV-infected children than in children not infected by HAdV. The long-term circulation of HAdVs with similar genetic characteristics could partially explain the generally poor clinical relevance of infections due to the strains identified in this study. In Italy, the most common HAdVs identified in children during the periods of this study were of the same species and of the same types of those identified several years before. Moreover, despite sequencing analyses that were focused on one of the more variable genes (hexon) [32] , no significant variation in HAdV genetic characteristics was seen and no recombination between viruses was found. HAdV-C2 strains were the only strains to have two slightly different clusters, suggesting the circulation of two different HAdV-C2 strains with indistinct pathogenetic roles. As a result, it is possible that many of the children had previously had contact with these viruses and developed sufficiently high immunity to limit the clinical expression of subsequent infections. However, the number of non-HAdV infection children included in this study is significantly higher than that of HAdV infected patients and this difference could have led comparison to wrong results. A longer period and expanded surveillance may help to construct the complete picture on the HAdV circulation, other infections and related clinical features.",

However, clinical differences between patients with high or low viral load were not always significant, and it is not possible to state that HAdV load can be a marker for severity of infection. By contrast, HAdV load was found to be significantly higher in patients developing severe HAdV infection after transplantation, especially in pediatric stem cell transplant recipients [31] . Consequently, the measurement of HAdV load is considered a possible method for an early diagnosis of disseminated HAdV disease and for the initiation and monitoring of antiviral therapy in these subjects [34] . Further studies are needed to evaluate whether high viral load could indicate which subjects might have to receive antiviral therapy to avoid negative evolution of the infection even if they are not immunocompromised.",

Moreover, these data seem to indicate that HAdVs are stable infectious agents that do not frequently incur genetic variations and, for this reason, do not cause frequently severe diseases. It seems that there are some differences in the severity of disease outcome between types and according to viral load, with HAdV type C and high viral load apparently associated with a more severe disease. However, further studies are needed to identify the potential pathogenetic role of the different species and types of HAdV and the importance of viral load in the severity of infection. Clarification of these unsolved problems may be useful for deciding how to develop adequate preventive and therapeutic measures for immunocompromised and otherwise healthy children who suffer from HAdV infection.",
