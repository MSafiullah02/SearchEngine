Clear guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and clear protocols for work abstinence during symptoms are vital to protect HCW and patients. Models of triage and diagnosis may help physicians and public health authorities to estimate infection risk and support decisions about such isolation and quarantine measures [9] . Our simple prediction model based on the seven symptoms most strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity among HCW, giving extra weight to anosmia and muscle ache as strongest predictors, gave a high sensitivity (91.2%) and a moderate specificity (55.6%). Where the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test or prediction algorithm are features of the test, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) are related to the infection prevalence in the population. With increasing prevalence, the PPV increases and NPV decreases. With a prevalence of infection of 10%, the above sensitivity and specificity would result in a PPV of 16.9% and NPV of 98.5%. This is very informative, as with only 1.5% chance of having SARS-CoV-2 upon a negative 'prediction', hospitals could consider letting those HCW work (with PPE), depending on the shortage of staff. Because of the low specificity, about half of HCW would be predicted as 'positive'. However, testing only this subgroup of 'predicted positives' would reduce the necessary testing materials by 50%.",

The HCW received the invitation to the questionnaire the day after receiving their test result, which was usually within 24 h after the sample was taken, thus minimising recall bias. The response rate was 64%, and selection bias could have occurred as people with atypical (i.e. non-respiratory symptoms) could have been more likely to respond to the questionnaire, leading to an overrepresentation of people with these symptoms. However, as the percentage of respiratory symptoms among test-positive and test-negative HCW was comparable, we do not expect that this could have explained the strong associations observed in this study. Our anonymous data collection did not allow us to examine initial symptoms in relation to disease progression. The study design would have allowed for the calculation of relative risks (RR), were it not that we had asked for four symptoms in a case-control manner. Even though RR are easier to interpret than OR, and OR may slightly overestimate the risk estimate, presenting a mix of RR and OR would have been confusing. In addition, presenting the OR with column percentages gives the useful insight of the percentage of cases (and noncases) that reported a certain symptoms.",

Our detailed report of early symptoms among HCW tested for SARS-CoV-2 identified that general non-respiratory symptoms and anosmia were strongly associated with test positivity.
