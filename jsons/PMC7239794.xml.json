Such active cinnamomic elements and their condimental properties have unpredictably varying pharmacological functions including anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-ageing [5], [6], [7], [8]. On top, various phytochemical studies on the cinnamon bark (cassia) have been long-established in vitro and vivo, revealing the existence of diterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids without any side effect or toxicity [8]. Despite these promising curative features, the extensive utilization of the cinnamon bark as an active biocidal agent is very minimal and low in pharmacodynamics action due to its poor dispersal and aqueous solubility as well as the lower absorption in the gastrointestinal process, and rapid metabolism to decrease foodstuffs (coumarin, di-tetra, hexahydrocinnamon, heterocyclic, eugenol, flavonoids and cinnamaldehyde) [6], [7], [8], [9].",

The conventional ONCs from their bulk sources can be obtained using the nanotechnology route. These tiny ONCs reveal enhanced pharmacological effects with improved solubilisation, biocompatibility, pharmacokinetic profile and the drug formulation [10]. In the nanoscale structures (nanoparticles or NCs, nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, nanofilms, nanofluid, etc.), the surface area to volume is significantly large, leading to the emergent physiochemical traits (such as efficient reactivity) that are absent in their bulk counterparts. More interesting features of these ONCs are related to the excellent interfaces with organic/genetic macromolecules such as membranes, DNA, proteins and RNA [10]. In fact, the protein molecules/structures that adsorbed effortlessly on their surfaces when bound to ONCs. Over the decades, to produce the high-quality ONCs with desirable size, phase, shape and elemental compositions several strategies have been adopted including the mechanical grinding/milling, plasma induced creation and chemical routes [6], [11]. Nonetheless, these growth methods are inadequate because of the poor stability of the formed ONCs, requisites of the further chemical purification, extreme-temperature reaction state, long-term consumption, and difficulty in the disruption ONCs [11], [12].",

The PLAL method is handy owing to its simplicity, economy, and efficiency. On top, it enables the large-scale reproducibility without requiring the toxic materials. Yet again, it is versatile for fabricating the inorganic\u2013organic NCs with unique surface chemistry and reactive quenching of the ablated species [13], [14]. Using this strategy, the physical/chemical properties of the ONCs can be controlled by adjusting the pulse laser parameters (fluence/energy density, width, wavelength, repetition rate, and duration) and liquid media [13], [14], [15]. Asahi and his co-authors disclosed that the higher fluence-ablation energy leads to the smaller size of NCs depending on the laser wavelength and pulse width [15], [16]. Additionally, Zhang et al reported that the continuous laser shots can increase the yield of the NCs [15]. In brief, the nature of the liquid media (solvent molecules) and ablation wavelength play an important role to deliver the promising thermodynamic conditions to obtain the NCs with required morphology (size and shape) and structure [14], [16].",

            "text": "It has been established that the nucleation of the cinnamon nanostructures can be critically sensitive to different types of growth liquid media and laser fluence (LF), signifying their uses towards biomedical applications [9], [14]. The PLAL supported growth mechanism was clarified in terms of a simple process relating to the cavitation bubble dynamic forces, plasma generation, and the impact of pulse laser factors on the formation of the ONCs [17], [18]. It has been comprehended that an interrelated laser pulse with a surface cinnamon target causes the formation of expanded plasma plume and cavitation bubble. Consequently, the cavitation bubble is then collapsed, leading a spreading of Cin-NCs into the citric acid solution. In general, the cavitation bubble lifetime extends with induced by the former pulse repetition rate and increasing of LF, thus the NCs production is higher [15], [18]. The mass profusion of Cin-NCs diverse to the bubble\u2019s form shows the nonappearance of high-density slope of cluster particles once the cavitation bubble has been to its maximum height. Premkumar et al. synthesised AgNPs doped cinnamon oil and evaluated their antimicrobial against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria strains [19]. The nano/micro emulsions from the cinnamon have been studied by Yildirim et al. [20] that confirmed its bioactivity against several pathogenic bacteria. The ONCs obtained from curcumin compound were indeed produced by chemical wet-milling, grinding milling and electro-hydrodynamic atomization method to test their antibacterial action [21]. Yet, growth of systematic preparation method for nature Cin-NCs with customised particle sizes and preferred antibacterial actions still remain challenging [22].",

These lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides structures were both comprised of the coupled lipids with negative charges, indicating that a less permeability into the Cin-NCs. Contrariwise, the bacteria membrane structure of S. aureus created a thick peptidoglycan, enfolding of linear polysaccharide chains cross connected by small peptides to construct a static structure in 3-D that trapped the permeation of the Cin-NCs to the bacteria structure [30].

Consequently, the protein sortase at the bacterial cell surface are efficiently inhibited, preventing the coalescence of the bacterial cells to fibronectin. The results affirmed that the Cin-NCs can adhere onto the bacterial cell walls and break them before being infiltrated within the membrane to rupture chemical components of the cell organelles. It has been established that the tinier nanoparticles reveal stronger bactericidal properties. Lee et al. [33] reported that nanoparticles with mean size range from 5 to 80 nm can destroy the microorganisms (bacteria such as the S. aureus and E. coli) by penetrating inside the bacterial cell membranes. In fact, tinier Cin-NCs can rupture efficiently the intracellular oxygen bonds, resulting in the severe oxidative damages and thus allowing the ultimate destruction of the bacterial cells membrane.",

Our results for optimum sample S4-90 showed that the lower OD600 of bacteria containing Cin-NCs after cultivation for a proper time verified the strongest antibacterial activity (Fig. 5 (c, d)) and Table 1). This disclosure was accredited to the influence of the Cin-NCs on the intracellular materials and subsequent destruction of the bacterial membrane structure that caused the coagulation and removal of cells in the liquid system. In addition, the Cin-NCs (S4-90 sample) with mean size of 10 \u00b1 0.3 nm had appreciable effect against the bacterial growth. This was due to the large surface area to volume ratio of the Cin-NCs that has strong interfacial interaction with the bacterial membranes structure [34], [35].",

Unique traits of these Cin-NCs were well analysed and determined using different spectroscopic and imaging tools. The morphology (size, shape and structure) and optical characteristics of these Cin-NCs were found to be sensitive to the nature of the liquid media and laser fluences. The antibacterial effectiveness of these Cin-NCs was evaluated against different bacteria strains. All the liquid media were favorable for synthesizing the Cin-NCs with strong antibacterial activity. In the present work, these spherical Cin-NCs with high chemical stability produced inside the citric acid medium (pH 4.5) demonstrated to have strongest antibacterial effectiveness, Especially, the presence of these Cin-NCs surrounded by the citric acid molecules have great physical properties compared to other media (ethanol and methanol) as shown in Table 2\n. These observations can be attributed to the high crystallinity of the Cin-NCs achieved via the optimized PLAL technique. Besides, these Cin-NCs grown inside the citric acid media showed excellent spherical morphologies, indicating their higher potential to delay the bacterial growth more efficiently than those produced inside methanol and ethanol. It is established that the PLAL technique may constitute a basis for the production of the Cin-NCs with desired characteristics useful for the development nanomedicines towards the protein spikes of coronavirus and antibacterial drug design.",

As-prepared NCs were characterised to analyses their structural, optical and antibacterial properties. These Cin-NCs were produced inside the liquid citric acid medium (acted as organic solvent) at various LF in a customized way. The influence of various LF on the structure, morphology, optical and bactericidal properties of the Cin-NCs were determined. The citric acid as a growth medium was demonstrated to be more promising for the fabrication of tiny spherical crystalline Cin-NCs with uniform distribution. In addition, the proposed PLAL method exhibited high productivity of NPs in the absence of any toxic chemicals that is demanding for the future antibacterial drug development. The strong UV\u2013Vis optical absorption at 269 and 310 nm shown by the Cin-NCs may be beneficial for new drug formulation. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs confirmed the existence of the symmetric-asymmetric stretching vibrations bands of the active component (polyphenols and cinnamaldehyde functional groups with characteristic bonds). The selected LF of 2.2 mJ/cm2 produced the best Cin-NCs (size and shape) with the mean diameter of approximately 10 \u00b1 0.3 nm. The antibacterial effectiveness of the Cin-NCs were evaluated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial cultures through the IZD and OD600 analyses. The best Cin-NCs (S4-90) revealed the strongest antibacterial action (IZD of 24 mm for S.aureus and 25 mm for E. coli). This outstanding antibacterial activity shown by the Cin-NCs was due to their high quantum yield, high stability and well-defined morphology. Also, the OD600 of the Cin-NCs affirmed their exceptional antibacterial potency when implemented on the bacterias growth over the time intervals of 5 up to the total of 45 h. In short, the PLAL supported growth process/mechanism and the antibacterial efficacy of the produced Cin-NCs was well-understood. The proposed Cin-NCs may be potential for the antibacterial drug formulation.",
