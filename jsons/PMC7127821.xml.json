While various factors have been clearly identified as significant in attracting international tourists, the degree of influence from being inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites (WHSs) by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on international tourism demand remains subject to debate. Although the accreditation of the World Heritage List (WHL) was meant to identify, recognize, and protect scenic spots of global value, the WHL is now widely used as a marketing tool for national tourism campaigns. This strategy is rooted in the belief that the WHL is a powerful boost for attracting tourism. Surprisingly, the impact of the WHL on fostering tourism has been little explored by rigorous econometric approaches. Moreover, existing findings are far from being clear and robust.",

However, the positive impact of WHSs becomes insignificant in the fixed-effect models. Inspired by Yang et al., 2010, Cellini, 2011 utilized data from Italy from 1996 to 2007 to show that UNESCO recognition is not an effective in attracting tourists. In response to Cellini, 2011, Yang and Lin, 2011 stated that the impact of being included among sites on the WHL could be examined from both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions. However, due to the time-invariant feature of the WHL variables in the short-run, the time-dimensional effect of the WHL based on a fixed-effects model may not be reliable and robust.

In the process of economic development, many cultural and natural heritage sites were increasingly threatened by the traditional causes of decay and by industrialization. Yet the protection of these heritages often remains incomplete at the national level, especially in developing and less-developed countries. In noting this formidable phenomenon of damage as well as inadequate conservation, the World Heritage Convention (hereafter, referred to as the Convention) of UNESCO launched an initiative in 1972 to preserve heritage sites considered to be of great value to humanity. The Convention enacted an international treaty called \u201cthe Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\u201d and began to ratify sites on the WHL in 1978.2\nOver the past three decades, under the coordinated effort of the World Heritage Center, an increasing number of famous and important sites have been recognized by and then protected by strict regulations. As of June 2010, 911 sites, comprising 704 cultural, 180 natural, and 27 mixed properties, have been recognized in 151 enlisted countries or regions.3\n",

In one sense, heritage sites are thought to induce prosperous tourism that create jobs and earn foreign exchange, thus serving as a major driving force for further growth in many countries (Herbert, 2001, McIntosh and Prentice, 1999, Wager, 1995). Specifically, once sites are inscribed on the list of WHSs, UNESCO provides financial as well as technological aid to repair and maintain those heritage sites (of particular importance for low-income countries that depend heavily on the tourism industry for economic growth). Conversely, visitation increases the threat of damage or destruction of the environmental and cultural integrity of the WHSs due to excess number of tourists. In light of this conflict, an emerging line of research has focused on discussing how to achieve a balance between strict protection of WHSs and tourism development, for example, Wager, 1995, Garrod and Fyall, 2000, Maikhuri et al., 2001, and Leask and Fyall (2006).4\n",

Since the end of the monopoly in 2002, several casino owners from Las Vegas have subsequently entered the market, for example, Sands Macau in 2004, Wynn Macau in 2006, and MGM Grand Macau as well as Venetian Macau in 2007. While gambling revenues from casinos were greatly prosperous, the Macau government tried to change the image of Macau tourism from gambling to diversified tourism; for example, hosting the Grand Prix and International Fireworks Festival. Moreover, the Macau government also promotes tourism aggressively through the MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions) policy. Importantly, re-molding Macau into a cultural city is a key strategy toward promoting tourism. As described on the UNESCO website: \u201cWith its historic street, residential, religious and public Portuguese and Chinese buildings, the historic centre of Macao provides a unique testimony to the meeting of esthetic, cultural, architectural and technological influences from East and West.\u201d The Macau government has aggressively conserved these features and promoted the unique culture of the international tourism market.

First, the estimated coefficients on EURO*WHL, AMER*WHL, and ANZ*WHL are all not statistically significant, suggesting that being listed on the WHL does not attract more tourists from European countries, North America, Australia, or New Zealand to visit Macau. One interpretation is that the cultural distance between Portugal and the above countries is shorter in terms of religion belonging to the Judeo-Christian faith.

In the FE estimates of Model 6, both coefficients of EASIA*WHL and SEASIA*WHL are significantly positive, suggesting that the tourism-enhancing effect of the WHL works for both Southeast Asian tourists and East Asian countries. One possible explanation is that Asian people are attracted by the foreign atmosphere of Portuguese culture and architecture.

Importantly, we find some appealing results through further examinations on the year effect and region-effect of tourism caused by the WHL. First, announcement of inscribing a site on the WHL seems to be an effective advertisement and promotion strategy stimulating more tourist arrivals in the short-run. Second, the tourism-enhancing effect of the WHL is different among countries and regions. In particular, the inscription of the \u201cHistoric Centre of Macau\u201d exhibits a significant impact on fostering more Asian tourists to Macau, especially for visitors from Southeast Asia, because the Portuguese-style architecture and culture appeal more to Asian travelers than to Western tourists. Finally, Macau is a special case with only one WHS. As a result, our empirical findings cannot apply to all sites of WHL. Indeed, whether a spot listed on WHL can attract more international visitors needs supporting infrastructures and facilities within the enlisted country. However, Macau acts as an excellent case for us to avoid problems associated with the time-invariant property of WHL variables in fixed-effects models. In this manner, our results are reliable and can lend insights on the impact of UNESCO recognition on tourism.",
