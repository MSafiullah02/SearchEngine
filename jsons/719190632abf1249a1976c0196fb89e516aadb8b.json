            "text": "Introduction: In late February 2020, due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Italian Government closed down all educational and sport activities. In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (\\ 70 mg/ dl), glucose range (70-180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia ([ 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. Results: In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177 \u00b1 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 \u00b1 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. Conclusion: Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.",

This continuous challenge results in people with T1D occasionally deprioritizing glycaemic control in favour of other activities [4] . Glucose control may improve during holidays, but this improvement is highly variable [5] [6] [7] .",

To reduce the spread of infection, in late February 2020, the Italian Government issued a series of restrictions that, in March 2020, culminated in an almost complete lockdown of the country [10] . This lockdown intially involved all sport and educational activities but was then extended to commercial activities and most non-essential services. During lockdown, all citizens were requested to ''stay at home'' [11] . Outpatient clinics were closed while hospitals were coping with thousands of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic not only caused morbidity and mortality among people with CoV disease but also imposed a heavy burden on societal and population health [12] . It is expected that individuals with chronic disease, such as diabetes, will suffer the most from the prolonged lockdown due to limitations in access to outpatient clinics and services.",

Clinical characteristics of the two groups are reported in Table 1 . None of the patients were known to be (have been) infected with SARS-CoV-2 nor to be (have been) quarantined for close contact with infected people. The 20 patients who stopped working due to the lockdown had an average age of 36.9 years, 60% were male and average diabetes duration was 15 years. The mean latest available HbA1c value was 7.6%, and the prevalence of complications was low. When data collected during the week before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy were compared to those of the first week of lockdown (period 2), average glucose had decreased from 177.7 \u00b1 45.6 mg/dl (9.9 \u00b1 2.5 mmol/l) to 161.0 \u00b1 40.3 mg/dl (8.9 \u00b1 2.2 mmol/l; p = 0.005; Fig. 1b) , which is equal to a reduction of 16.7 \u00b1 24.5 mg/dl (0.9 \u00b1 1.4 mmol/l).

As a result of the simultaneous improvement in average glucose and the standard deviation, patients moved from a high-unstable profile towards a lowstable profile (Fig. 1c) . The number of patients in the low-stable profile area increased from three to eight (p = 0.02). However, the CV%, which is a better measure of glycaemic stability according to international consensus and recommendations [20, 21] , did not change substantially across the periods considered.",

Many outpatient clinics have had to change their routine interactions with patient and use telemedicine to monitor patients at home [25] . In Italy, the widespread use of FGM among people with T1D allowed these patients to be remotely connected to the clinic through the cloud. Diabetes professionals were concerned that glucose control could worsen during lockdown because of the limited possibility to exercise and the severe psychologic stress imposed by social distancing in a cultural environment heavily reliant on direct inter-personal relationships. During the outbreak, most non-essential activities were shut down, and most citizens stopped their usual working routine or turned to working at home. However, some people, such as those involved in healthcare or the food supply chain, continued to work during the lockdown. Our observation that glucose control improved during the first week of lockdown in people with T1D who stayed at home is reassuring and suggests that a slowing down of routine activities can have favourable effects on glucose control in the short term. Remarkably, the reduction in average glucose and the increase in time in range were not paralleled by an increased time in hypoglycaemia, which remained stable. We speculate that such an improvement occurred because patients had more time to concentrate on diabetes control and had a more regular lifestyle, including the timing and composition of meals, while not being exposed to workplace stress [26] . In addition, the knowledge that diabetes worsens the outcomes of COVID-19 [27, 28] may have improved patients' awareness and compliance to diabetes management.",

The observation that glucose control did not improve in this subgroup of T1D patients supports our interpretation. However, the groups of patients who stopped working and those who continued their usual working activities were not comparable because the latter had a better baseline glucose control than those who stayed at home, and [ 60% were on insulin pump therapy. Users of pump therapy represent approximately 30% of patients with T1D at our clinic, and 13% of T1D patients nationwide [29] . The frequent use of insulin pump therapy among this group of patients is probably related to the fact that most were healthcare workers and/or shift workers who often need pump therapy to cope with their lifestyle and working schedules. Patients who continued working had a higher time in range at baseline, such that further improvements were more difficult to obtain. Yet, it is reasonable to assume that these individuals were subjected to stronger challenges during lockdown, including exercise limitations, social distancing, workplace stress, and fear of infection. Therefore, that these patients maintained good glycaemic control is reassuring in terms of their effective self-management of diabetes. We speculate that the use of FGM combined with insulin pump therapy contributed to this effect [30] ; for example by limiting diabetes-related distress [31] .",

Therefore, it remains unclear whether the same results would apply to patients with worse glucose glycaemic control or less frequent sensor scans.
