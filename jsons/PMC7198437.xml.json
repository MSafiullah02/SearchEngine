However, it has the nature of time consuming and high false negative [3]. Thus, it is urgent to find an effective and accurate method to screen COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a critical tool in the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia. Shi et al. studied the CT image data of 81 COVID-19 pneumonia patients and found that in the Chest CT scan, COVID-19 pneumonia often presented bilateral and subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) [4]. Ai et al. showed that the diagnostic results of CT images were highly consistent with RT-PCR assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. They also found that CT had a very high sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [5]. Although CT images have shown great potential for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia, currently, it is needed to manually identify radiographic features of COVID-19 pneumonia from all the thinner layer CT images (average 300 layers per patient) by trained radiologists. This will significantly increase the workload of radiologists, and could delay the diagnosis and following treatment.",

In some detailed classification, segmentation and detection problem, deep learning can achieve human-level accuracy, such as in pulmonary nodules diagnosis [6], breast cancer diagnosis [7], retina image segmentation [8], etc. In clinical applications of lung diseases, Coudray et al. studied the use of pathological images of lung cancer tissues to predict lung cancer subtypes and gene mutations [9]. They trained the deep learning network inceptionV3 to establish prediction models, and achieved good performance in independent validation sets. Wang et al. used CT image data from lung regions to predict EGFR gene mutations using an end-to-end deep learning network, and achieved the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the validation set of 241 cases [10]. Hence, the deep learning-based methods can be used to assist radiologists to improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we aimed to train a diagnostic model based on deep learning network on the chest CT images to screen the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Inspired by this, in this study, we selected the layer with the largest lung region as region of interest. As previous study of chest CT images has shown that images from multiple views can contribute to learning more useful information without introducing more redundant information [6]. To predict the classification of lung nodules by CT images, a multi-view deep learning model of lung nodules classification study showed good performance.

For these four patients, their risk scores with COVID-19 infections are 0.801, 0.461, 0.946, and 0.315 (range from 0-1), which were evaluated by the multi-view deep learning fusion model. In this study, we took the cut-off of the model as 0.653, according to Youden index. Normally, it takes more than ten minutes to examine the CT images of on patient and to identify the COVID-19 infected patient by a trained radiologist. In contrast, less than five seconds are taken to achieve the comparable screen result in COVID-19 pneumonia identification using multi-view deep learning model, which will mitigate over 100-fold workload of radiologist in the initial screening of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Artificial intelligence tools, more specifically, deep learning networks are the promising tools to assist radiologists in the initial screening of COVID-19. Eventually, it could mitigate the workload of radiologists, improve diagnosis efficiency and provide more timely and appropriate treatments for COVID-19 patients. In this study, we developed a multi-view deep learning fusion model to discriminate the patient with COVID-19 through CT images. Compared with the single-view model, the multi-view model used more information of CT images and showed better performance. For the single-view model, it is easy to be overfitting because there is less information to use. Moreover, if the training is conducted on the data of only one hospital, it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution, which is not necessarily effective to the other hospitals, so the performance of the model may fluctuate greatly among different hospitals.",

            "text": "To date, some efforts on COVID-19 diagnostic through AI approaches have been reported [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. Chen et al. [16] developed and validated deep learning diagnostic model of COVID-19 pneumonia using single view CT slices of 106 cases patients from single center. They achieved the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.989, 0.943 and 0.992, respectively, in the testing set. In another two centers study, Wang et al. [17] used 99 patients CT images data to identify COVID-19 pneumonia by transfer learning method. The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of their model in the testing set were 0.780, 0.731, 0.670 and 0.760, respectively. It is important to note that most of patients with COVID-19 are more likely to have CT abnormalities characterized by bilateral and subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO), vascular thickening, spider web, and crazy-paving patterns [[19], [20], [21]], while patients with other pneumonia mainly show patchy or density increasing shadows [22]. The advanced AI-based algorithms can discriminate COVID-19 from other pneumonia by learning not only these typical CT image signs, but also some high-dimensional features, such as texture, wavelet information etc., which are unable processed by radiologists. Consequently, these deep learning-based studies showed significant effect on the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia through CT images. However, due to the small datasets and less than two centers were involved in these studies, the CT slices were taken as samples for developing deep learning model, resulting in inter-slice fusion and time cost issues. In addition, the generalization performance on multicentre data remains to be verified. Here, we utilized the information from the automatic segmentation of multi-view of CT images to train our deep learning network, which avoided the heavy workload of manually sketching the features in CT images of patients with pneumonia by the radiologists. Therefore, we could take one patient as a sample, which means that one patient only needs to be tested once. In this study, we established and verified the performance of the multi-view deep learning fusion model on 495 multi-center data. Our results further demonstrated that our model has the great potential to be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.",
