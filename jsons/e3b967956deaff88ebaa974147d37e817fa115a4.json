On the same date, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by this virus coronavirus disease 2019 in the International Classification of Diseases [6] . As of March 11, 2020 when the Covid-19 outbreak had spread worldwide and reached 118,319 confirmed cases and 4,292 confirmed deaths, WHO declared it a global pandemic [8] [9] [10] .

Data came from the centre for Diseases Prevention and Control of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. 94% of the cases were inpatients from hospitals affiliated to this University. Among 4,000 cases with severe symptoms, 1,278 cases were confirmed as true Covid-19 cases by realtime reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and\\or pharyngeal swabs. Clinical and demographic results from these 1,278 laboratory-confirmed cases were included in a review of exposure history, health outcomes and symptoms. Admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or the use of mechanical ventilation within this cohort were the primary end-points. Secondary end-point was the duration of hospitalization that was defined as the time from onset of symptom(s) until discharge from the hospital as dead or recovered. The study could not calculate CFR of Covid-19 infection due to small sample size and selection bias. Fever was defined by axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher. Prescribed medications were the Kaletra combination (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir used for treatment of HIV-1) and antibiotic which was prescribed for severe cases, and tamiflu (Oseltamivir phosphate -normally used for treatment of influenza) combination which was prescribed for mild cases.",

[20] who reported a median age (IQR) of 47.0 (35.0 -58.0) years where 55.1% of their cases were between 15-49 years old (1) and also younger than the 64 years reported in other studies [21, 22] . Although, the most frequent Covid-19 infection occurred in the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups, the frequency of infection was also considerable in age groups of 30-39 and 40-49 years. The high frequency of Covid-19 infection in these age groups may be due to low median age (30 years) of the Iranian population and/or due to inclusion of mainly working-age population in this age group [23] . It seems that the frequency of Covid-19 infections rises considerably from age group of 50-59 years [24] . In contrast to findings in China and Italy [6, 25] , we found a considerably higher proportion of fatalities in the age groups panning the range from 20 to 50 year of age.",

All patients admitted to ICU received broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications, a combination that may have contributed to the lower mortality rate. Examination of this hypothesis remains for future studies. Another reason is that ICU care was carried out by an expert hospital team.

Owing to incomplete laboratory testing at the time, we could not analyse laboratory data which therefore remain for future studies.
