At the time of writing, there are significant outbreaks across much of the world with Europe identified as the epicentre. It seems clear that health psychology has an important role to play in understanding how people will respond and cope to the threat of COVID\u201019 and how they will adhere and adapt to transmission\u2010related behaviours including hand washing and self\u2010isolation.",

In 2010, BJHP published a review of \u2018Demographic and attitudinal determinants of protective behaviours during a pandemic\u2019 (Bish & Michie, 2010), finding that communications to promote preventative behaviours should be targeted to specific demographic groups and should focus on raising perceived threat and the effectiveness of behavioural measures to reduce risk. Susan Michie and colleagues have recently written about understanding behaviour and behavioural strategies for reducing COVID\u201019 transmission (https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/03/03/behavioural-strategies-for-reducing-covid-19-transmission-in-the-general-population/ and https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/03/11/slowing-down-the-covid-19-outbreak-changing-behaviour-by-understanding-it/) drawing on the COM\u2010B model (Michie et al., 2011) to identify issues of capability, opportunity, and motivation that might impact on behaviours and discussing behavioural strategies to address barriers.",

The Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin has recently produced a working paper on 'Using behavioural science to help fight the coronavirus' (Lunn et al., 2020\nhttps://www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/WP656.pdf) which in addition to personal hygiene behaviours, considers pro\u2010social behaviours, panic\u2010buying, communication, risk perception, and the impacts of isolation. In 2013, BJHP published the findings of a survey conducted during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 that indicated the importance of precise and clear information about control measures for reducing anxiety (Taha et al., 2014). Brooks et al. (2020) recently published a rapid review focusing on the psychological impact of quarantine and how best to enable people to cope which reported the importance of clear information, and that voluntary quarantine is \u2018associated with less distress and fewer long\u2010term complications\u2019.",

(2018) undertook a systematic review of the factors affecting the psychological well\u2010being of health care workers involved in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis and recommended that employers should provide support for those most at risk and that health care workers should be prepared for the potential psychological impact of this work. It seems likely that these impacts will be significant in the case of COVID\u201019.",

There is therefore an urgent need for health psychology research. To that end, we invite contributions to BJHP that address any area of health psychology research related to the coronavirus pandemic to our fast\u2010track COVID\u201019 route. We will prioritize and expedite the peer review process for these papers so that they can be published online without delay. Papers may be of any of the traditional forms described in our author guidelines, but we will also accept brief reports on this topic. Brief reports should not exceed 2,000 words and should have no more than two tables or figures (see online author guidelines, \u2018Brief\u2010Report COVID\u201019\u2019, for more details).",
