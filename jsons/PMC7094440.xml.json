Fever, dyspnea [1], lymphopenia, neutropenia [2, 3] and lower tract respiratory infection [1] were commonly found in infected individuals. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that SARS\u2010CoV is a novel member of the viral family coronaviradae, with an RNA genome of 29.7 kbp [4, 5, 6]. At least five viral structural proteins (VSPs), namely the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein, together with the newly identified ORF3a [7, 33], were encoded from the genome [9, 10]. Among these proteins, expression of S, M and N are necessary and sufficient for pseudovirus assembly mimicking those found in SARS\u2010CoV infected cells [11, 12].",

            "text": "Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that survival of viruses depends on the successful modulation of apoptosis initiated either by the hosts or the viruses themselves [13, 14, 15, 16]. Several studies have associated apoptosis with the pathogenesis of coronaviruses [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Previous reports suggested that over\u2010expression of certain coronaviral proteins could induce apoptosis in vitro [22, 23]. For SARS\u2010CoV, clinical symptoms, such as depletion of hepatocytes and T lymphocytes, i.e., lymphopenia, were suggested to be related to apoptosis [24, 25, 26]. It was also demonstrated that in vitro replication of SARS\u2010CoV induces apoptosis [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Recently, the ORF3a and the accessory protein 7a, but not the N, M and E protein of SARS\u2010CoV, was demonstrated to induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells [8, 32]. In contrast, it is reported that the E and N protein of SARS\u2010CoV induces apoptosis in Jurkat T and COS\u20101 cells, respectively, under serum depletion conditions [34, 35]. It was also reported that baculovirus\u2010mediated expression of the N\u2010terminal (S1) but not the C\u2010terminal (S2) domain of the S protein of SARS\u2010CoV triggers the cell survival\u2010related AP\u20101 signaling pathway in lung cells [36]. Nevertheless, the possible role(s) of the SARS\u2010CoV VSPs in the virus\u2010induced apoptosis is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated a possible role of SARS\u2010CoV S protein in virus\u2010induced apoptosis using recombinant adenovirus (rAd)\u2010mediated expression system. The apoptotic properties of S, S1 and S2 protein, as well as other VSPs, including E, M and N protein, were investigated in Vero E6 cells.",

The cloned cDNA fragments were tagged at the carboxy\u2010terminal with a V5 epitope. The signal peptide of pig growth hormone (SPpGH) [38] was placed upstream of the coding sequences of S (18\u20131255), S1 (18\u2013683) and also S2 (684\u20131255), so as to ensure a comparable post\u2010translational modifications for all the spike protein fragments used in the study. The transgenes were then subcloned into a modified bicistronic shuttle vector designated as pShuttle\u2010CMV\u2010GOI\u2010IRES\u2010eGFP, which is derived from the pShuttle vector of the AdEasy\u2122 XL Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene) and the plasmid pBMN\u2010I\u2010GFP (Dr. G.P. Nolan, Stanford University School of Medicine). The bicistronic expression cassette contains the gene of interest (GOI) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), which are driven by a CMV promotor and an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), respectively (Fig. 1A). The recombinant adenovirus containing the VSPs (rAd\u2010VSPs) was then generated by incorporating the expression cassette into the pAdEasy\u20101 vector (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). A control adenovirus (rAd\u2010Ctrl) with no transgene was also constructed. The rAds were propagated in AD\u2010293 cells and CsCl\u2010purified as described [39].",

Therefore, a MOI of 100 was chosen as the upper dose limit of the rAd transductions in this study. The successful and comparable transductions of all rAd\u2010VSPs were ensured in which at least 95% of cells showed the expression of eGFP and V5 epitope as detected by flow cytometer (data not shown), while the expression of SARS\u2010CoV VSPs was further confirmed by Western blots (Fig. 1C). It was noted that the well\u2010resolved double band pattern was observed for S and S1 at around 200 and 110 kDa, respectively, which mirrored previous reports that these two proteins are heavily glycosylated [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Among the bands of the S protein doublets, the one with lower molecular weight is at about 180 kDa, which is expected to be the glycosylated protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the one with higher molecular weight, which is about 200 kDa, is expected to represent its more complexly glycosylated form that is found in Golgi bodies [46].",

Using rAd\u2010mediated expression system, we assessed the apoptotic effect of the major structural proteins of SARS\u2010CoV, including S, S1, S2, E, M and N protein. Typical features of apoptosis such as cell rounding, shrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and PE\u2010externalization were observed only in cells transduced with rAd carrying S and S2, but not S1, nor other structural proteins studied. These data suggest that the over\u2010expression of SARS\u2010CoV S and S2 could induce apoptosis. The present findings seem to be unique within the coronavirus family. In MHV [22] and IBV [23], overexpression of S protein did not induce observable apoptosis in vitro. On the other hand, the observed in vitro apoptotic effects of the VSPs of other coronaviruses, such as the E protein of MHV [22] and the N protein of TGEV [20], were, however, not observed when we overexpressed the SARS\u2010CoV homologues in Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, the E and N protein of SARS\u2010CoV has been reported to induce apoptosis in Jurkat T and COS\u20101 cells, respectively, under serum depletion conditions [34, 35], which were not observed under the conditions tested in the current and a previously study [33]. Recently, over\u2010expression of two newly identified viral proteins of SARS\u2010CoV, ORF3a and 7a, were shown to induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells as well, which is associated with caspase\u20108 and \u20103 activity, respectively [32, 33]. Since the expression level of these viral proteins in SARS\u2010CoV infected cells has not been clearly demonstrated, their pro\u2010apoptotic properties may not be the only contributing factor in SARS\u2010CoV induced apoptosis. In contrast, the S protein is one of the major viral proteins in SARS\u2010CoV infected cells apart from N protein [47]. In SARS\u2010CoV infected Vero E6 cells, cleavage of the S protein into fragments was suggested in previous studies [41, 43], which includes a form that resembles the S2 protein in this study, and the inhibition of such protein processing completely abrogated the virus\u2010induced cytopathic effects in vitro, suggesting the potential roles of S and S2 in SARS\u2010CoV induced apoptosis. Although the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, caspase cascade, and the p38 MAPK\u2010dependent pathway are reported in several in vitro models of SARS\u2010CoV induced apoptosis [27, 28, 30, 31], the viral component(s) responsible for these observations remains unclear. Ren and co\u2010workers demonstrated that the addition of inactivated SARS\u2010CoV viral particles to Vero E6 cells is unable to induce apoptosis, implicating that expression of viral genes is indispensable for the viral\u2010induced apoptosis in vitro. Regarding these findings, the pro\u2010apoptotic properties of S and S2 in this report and the comparative study between the apoptotic pathways initiated by expression of individual viral genes and viral infection would certainly provide important clues in dissecting the molecular components responsible for the SARS\u2010CoV induced apoptosis.",
