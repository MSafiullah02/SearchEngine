In one meta-analysis, the relative risk for experiencing severe versus nonsevere COVID-19 disease was 58%, 59%, and 71% higher in patients with hypertension, respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease, respectively. 1 Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes may upregulate expression of ACE2, the latter being involved in the binding and uptake of SARS-CoV-2 to the lung epithelium. 2 ACE2 may also be unregulated by smoking in small airway epithelia. 3 It remains unclear whether the increased risk of COVID-19 infection is attributable to hypertension or agerelated comorbidity per se. Current hypertension or heart failure guidelines do not advocate stopping or switching ACE inhibitors or ARBs.",

Having said that compassionate use of iv remdesivir in 53 patients with severe COVID-19 infection resulted in 68% having improved oxygenation status and 18% mortality among those receiving invasive ventilation, albeit with no control arm for comparison. 5 There has also been interest in using azithromycin for COVID-19. It has been included in the ACTION (NCT04332107) and HyAzOUT (NCT04334382) trials on the basis of its immunomodulatory and putative antiviral activity, although its effects on SARS-CoV-2 remains speculative. 6 Caution is advised in trials evaluating azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (NCT04335552), due to potential additive effects on QT interval prolongation and propensity for arrhythmias.",

Hydroxychloroquine is safer and more potent in terms of in vitro SARS-CoV-2 suppression. 7, 8 Hydroxychloroquine acts via ACE2 and increases endosomal pH to attenuate SARS-CoV-2 endocytic host cell entry into the lung epithelium. Hydroxychloroquine has shown some promising preliminary clinical results in terms of attenuating in vivo SARS-CoV-2 viral load 6 and has been included in the WHO SOLIDARITY trial as well as the NIHR RECOVERY and PRINCIPLE trials. Hydroxychloroquine may also exhibit downstream immunosuppressive effects by reducing IL-6 production from T cells and monocytes, 9 which may explain in part its use in autoimmune conditions. To date one non peer reviewed randomised controlled trial from France with hydroxychloroquine added to usual care in 181 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia reported no significant impact on the primary end point of intensive care or death within 7 days, while 9.5% of patients had to stop hydroxychlorquine due to QT prolongation. Bromhexine is an over-the-counter cough remedy that blocks receptor-mediated viral cell entry via the transmembrane protease, serine 2 enzyme (TMPRSS2). 10 Theoretically, there could be potential synergy in terms of more effectively blocking viral host cell entry using combined hydroxychloroquine and bromhexine (NCT04340349), but at present this only remains speculative. It remains to be seen whether such agents are more likely to be effective early on in COVID-19 disease given that they prevent upstream viral entry.",

            "text": "Little consideration appears to have been given to susceptible patients with obstructive airways disease with regard to COVID-19 infection. In particular, elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have impaired respiratory reserve and a plethora of comorbidities, which potentially confers both pathophysiological and pharmacological susceptibility. Such individuals are at high risk of adverse outcomes as a result of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with COPD taking inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combination therapy have an increased pneumonia risk, especially with lipophilic drugs such as fluticasone furoate, 11 due to its prolonged lung retention and associated local immunosuppression in the presence of altered lung microbiome and impaired mucociliary clearance. 12 Moreover, suppression of interferon by fluticasone propionate is associated with an increased bacterial load after rhinovirus infection. 13 Corticosteroids may also attenuate production of the antibacterial protective peptide cathelicidin in the lung epithelium. 14 Thus, secondary bacterial infection might contribute to the cumulative inflammatory burden in addition to viral pneumonia. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating from COPD to asthma, even though up to 20% of patients with COPD have a corticosteroid responsive eosinophilic component. Hence, in patients with COPD with blood eosinophils 300 cells/mL, the benefit of fluticasone furoate in reducing severe exacerbations outweighs its risk in inducing severe pneumonia. 15 Nevertheless, one Canadian cohort study of patients with asthma demonstrated that current ICS use was associated with a 45% relative increased risk of pneumonia, amounting to an excess of 1.44 cases per 1000 patient-years. 16 Interestingly, ciclesonide and mometasone, but not budesonide, beclomethasone, or fluticasone, exhibit in vitro suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication to a similar degree as lopinavir, albeit in preliminary non peer reviewed data. 17 For ciclesonide, its target on viral replication appears to be nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15). Budesonide and formoterol independently suppress systemic suppression of IL-6 in relation to acute lung injury in the mouse model. 18 Pointedly, asthmatics taking ICS are 49% less likely to have a severe outcome after hospitalization for influenza A/H1/N1 infection, 19 perhaps inferring a generic protective ICS class effect. In the meantime, the key message for patients with asthma is to adhere to their ICS controller therapy as this is likely to offer the best protection against any viral insult including SARS-CoV-2. At this juncture, no evidence can support switching patients with controlled asthma to inhaled ciclesonide or mometasone. A study evaluating ciclesonide in South FIGURE 1.

One non peer reviewed study in severe COVID-19 infection found that the risk of respiratory failure in patients with maximal circulating IL-6 levels >80 pg/mL was 22-fold higher with a median time to mechanical ventilation of 1.5 days. 23 A more selective approach is therefore required to address the downstream cytokine storm.

With this in mind we believe studies are urgently warranted to investigate such combination therapy in older susceptible individuals with comorbidities who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Ultimately, the indications for such combined therapies will be determined by factors such as stage of disease, safety, cost, and route of administration.",

Patients with eosinophilic asthma and COPD should continue to use ICS-containing therapy to maintain optimal control and protect against viral insults including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strategies including antiviral therapy such as lopinavirritonavir or blocking viral host cell entry with hydroxychloroquine may not be successful unless used earlier in the course of COVID-19 infection. More severe COVID-19 infection may produce a cytokine storm associated with hyperinflammatory syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, with IL-6 levels being highly predictive of respiratory failure. Screening for biomarkers of hyperinflammation such as cytopenia, CRP, D-dimer, plasma viscosity, and ferritin may identify at-risk patients where cytokine suppression may be beneficial. Clinical trials are urgently warranted to evaluate a combined therapeutic strategy to target upstream and downstream pathways in severe COVID-19 disease.",
