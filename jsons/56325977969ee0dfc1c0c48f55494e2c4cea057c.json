Cancer care in LMICs, including Ghana, is faced with inadequate numbers of skilled healthcare professionals and essential material resources which negatively impacts the quality of healthcare and wellbeing of patients. In the face of COVID-19, cancer patients are likely to be affected in three key ways: access to healthcare, increased financial toxicity and increased mental health burden as a consequence of strict measures being implemented to contain the virus in Ghana, including partial lockdowns and social distancing. Some cultural beliefs regarding COVID-19 and its influence on the health and wellbeing of cancer patients have also been discussed. Measures by the government to lessen the burden on citizens and health workers are highlighted with possible recommendations for improvement in cancer care in Ghana and other LMICs during this pandemic.",

The most prevalent is prostate and breast cancer in males and females respectively. Specialized oncology services are mostly provided in three health facilities throughout the country located in urban centres (2 public and 1 private). Some regional and other tertiary institutions perform some surgery and systemic therapy especially for breast cancer. The skilled oncology workforce in Ghana is below average as per many other sub-Saharan African countries [2] .",

Moreover, with a reduction in earning capacity and travel restrictions, a good portion of patients will default on their treatment as many rely on extended family income to support treatments. Ghana reported its first 2 cases on March 12, 2020 [4] . As at April 12 th 2020, the official number of confirmed cases are 408 and 8 deaths [4] . Majority of these confirmed cases are in Ghana's capital Accra (87.5%) and in Kumasi (8%) with 57% as a result of community transmission [4] . This has led the Ghanaian government to enact closure of its schools and borders (land, air and sea), partial lockdowns of the two major cities mostly hit by the virus, provision of personal protective equipment to frontline healthcare workers, surveillance systems including contact tracing with testing (37,000 PCR based test performed to date) and mandatory quarantine of high-risk individuals to contain the pandemic.",

More so, cancer patients in Ghana are oblivious of the dangers of the increased risk of COVID-19 transmission and poorer outcomes in cancer patients and survivors [9] . For them, nothing could be worse than a cancer diagnosis, therefore delaying treatment seems like a double jeopardy. It is not unusual for a patient to present to the oncology department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and needing to be triaged for testing, which unfortunately could take 3 to 5 days to process in either of the two designated testing centres in Kumasi and Accra. All of this places undue burden on the cancer workforce who currently do not have access to SARS-CoV-2 testing or sufficient PPE, as oncology departments are not considered frontline workers. The challenge is the majority of these patients have already delayed presenting for diagnosis as well as delayed initiating interventions [10] . With the current ban on imports, it is unnerving to think about the high possibility of drug stock being depleted as almost all our systemic therapy medications are imported. The fears and uncertainties about further delays in treatments could affect the mental health and quality of life of both patient and oncologists. Moreover, the ban on social gatherings including religious activities is likely to exacerbate their mental health state as socializing and spirituality play a significant role in the health and wellbeing of cancer patients in Ghana [11] .",

Also, of concern is the negative effects of alcohol on cancer outcomes. Other harmful beliefs including the suspected use of COVID-19 test samples for ritual purposes may further jeopardize containment efforts as people are refusing their samples to be taken. This is similar to beliefs among Nigerians leading to the boycott of polio vaccination in the early 2000s [12, 13] . We expect that some cancer patients will resort to unorthodox health practices especially outside of the locked down areas, further worsening their plight. In a country with lower than average health literacy rate, where spirituality and communal living abounds, our governments need to enact strict measures to protect the vulnerable.",
