Although classified as low global risk, the current EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo), combined with the recurring emergence of high-consequence infections (e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SAR], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, 2009 H1N1 influenza), highlights the need for ongoing preparations.[1] Healthcare personnel (HCP) are particularly vulnerable to occupationally-acquired infection during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including EVD and SARS owing, perhaps, to uncertainty about the route of transmission and necessary personal protective equipment.[2,3] After the infection of two HCP with EVD, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revised their recommendation for personal protective equipment (PPE) to eliminate skin exposure, though PPE guidance continued to be updated through 2016.[4,5]",

More specifically, questions included: 1) how PPE ensembles were selected, 2) considerations for PPE acquisition and use, and 3) how training in the use of PPE ensembles and EVD patient care was developed and delivered. While there is a growing body of literature describing preparations for the 2014\u20132015 EVD outbreak, this study is unique because it allows comparison of experiences across different types of acute care hospitals (with different roles in the regional EVD plan), and between HCP who planned and received training.[6\u20139] The study objectives were achieved using semistructured interviews with HCP involved with EVD preparations, and surveying HCP who participated in training for the use of enhanced PPE ensembles for EVD.",

Multiple choice answers were used to describe characteristics of the trainees and the training. Likert scales were used for perceived impact and experience.

Our results, however, do not suggest that substantial changes in routine practices have occurred outside of ETCs that would ease preparations for the next outbreak of an emerging or high-consequence infectious disease of a similar scale, as limited refresher training is ongoing, and only two hospitals interviewed have modified routine training in the use of PPE. Interviewed trainers expressed the perception that the immediacy of the threat of a high-consequence infectious disease has decreased, which is likely a driver to decreased institutional commitment to preparedness activities, and failure to institutionalize changes resulting from lessons learned in the EVD preparations. In addition, with the 2018\u20132019 EVD outbreak in Congo at a low global risk, there has not been a response to initiate refresher training at non-ETCs.",

This approach is consistent with the spirit of standard precautions. Standard precautions require HCP to perform specific behaviors (e.g., hand hygiene), select PPE and use work practices that are appropriate to the nature of anticipated contact with body fluids.[23] Application of standard precautions to the care of a symptomatic EVD patient leads to the enhanced PPE ensemble ultimately recommended by the CDC. More specifically, given the large volumes of body fluid emitted in late-stage EVD and the large number of sites where Ebola virus may initiate infection, it is necessary to protect the dermis, facial mucous membranes and (controversially) the respiratory tract from contact with patients\u2019 bodily fluids.[24\u201327] Furthermore, the high EVD mortality rate observed in Africa requires a precautionary approach to worker protection.[28] In this context, standard precautions would identify the need for fluid-impermeable PPE to protect the entirety of the dermis, the mucous membranes, and the respiratory tract. The lower rates of EVD mortality observed in the United States and Europe and improved understanding of virus shedding in the early stages of EVD could allow a change in the PPE ensemble under the standard precautions framework, such as the two-tier, symptom-based, PPE recommendations.[29,30]",

A barrier identified was debate over the appropriate frequency of training, though surveyed trainees who wanted refresher training, wanted it to occur 1\u20132 times annually. The annual interval for many occupational health trainings is driven by logistical concerns rather than evidence of skill retention. Training in complex activities like PPE donning/doffing may need to occur more frequently than annually.",

While this study used a stratified random sampling scheme to identify hospitals for recruitment of interviewed trainers to help ensure that varied experiences were represented, individuals declined to participate or were not responsive to recruitment efforts. Some individuals specifically cited negative experiences during the EVD preparations as a reason to not participate, which may have led to a bias in our sample towards individuals with positive experiences. However, all interviewed trainers described the period of the 2014\u20132015 EVD outbreak as extremely stressful, and some described negative experiences. Amongst our sample of interviewed trainers, however, there was consistency among responses, suggesting that saturation was reached for many of our questions, despite the modest sample size. The trainee survey was distributed through referral sampling, and received a small number of responses, but there is no reason to believe that interviewed trainers distributed the survey to a specific subset of potentially eligible colleagues. Given the limited sample size, inferences from the survey were limited, but findings were consistent with interviewed trainers. This mixed methods approach \u2014 an effort to triangulate the true experience of HCP involved in EVD preparations \u2014 is the strength of the research approach. By design, the study captured the experience in the Chicagoland area and was conducted after the conclusion of the 2014\u20132015 EVD outbreak. Thus, experiences described herein may be specific to Chicago and subject to recall bias.",

Refresher training is essential for maintaining preparedness, and there is a need to determine, through research, a training interval that maintains skills while minimizing cost and administrative burden. Hospitals were able to improvise and identify other sources of information to guide PPE selection in the face of dissatisfaction with initial CDC recommendations, using an approach consistent with the philosophy of standard precautions. Occupational health agencies could and should fill the need for guidance for PPE selection and evaluation that is relevant to diverse infectious diseases, and acknowledge the need to consider: protection level, ease of use, ensembles, and availability. Such guidance could result from revisiting PPE selection in the context of standard precautions and/or the development of a tool to guide decision making.",
