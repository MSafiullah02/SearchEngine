In the following months, this viral infection, as known as COVID-19, became a pandemic that now is engaging an ever-growing number of individuals across the globe, with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 not only has impacted healthcare systems at the global levels but also has led to a significant downturn in the world economy, both of which may increase the adverse effects of this infectious disease, particularly in resource-limited areas.",

It appears that transmission of this virus is mostly via droplets unless infected individuals undergo aerosol-generating procedures that result in the airborne mode of transmission. Indeed, places that implemented social distancing, hand washing, and face masks as a priority have had success in controlling the spread of this virus. The other concern is that asymptomatic individuals could also shed the virus and thus contribute to its rapid spread in the communities 2 . Therefore, widespread testing and contact tracking of infected individuals could also result in a slower spread of this disease.",

However, it seems that the respiratory system is one of the most commonly engaged organs. COVID-19 pneumonia could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the characteristics of COVID-19-associated ARDS may be similar or differ from those seen in ARDS due to other causes. Specifically, COVID-19associated ARDS engages older individuals and those with comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus) 4 ; is associated with significant dyspnea 4 ; it presents with different phenotypes (i.e., L vs. H phenotypes that differ by lung elastance, ventilation to perfusion ratio [V/Q], right-to-left shunt, and lung recruitability 5 ); it imposes hypoxia that could be due to high shunt physiology (i.e., hypoventilated areas of the lung are very hyperemic 6 particularly in H phenotype); patients so afflicted require a prolonged period to resolve their ARDS 7 ; and it has high mortality rates (51%) 4 . These patients frequently require a higher level of care in hospitals or intensive care units (ICU), and deescalation to a lower level of care or discharge may require several days. These factors have led to tremendous pressure on the healthcare systems, particularly in the COVID-19 hot-spots. The ability to triage patients who may need care levels escalation could not only assist with appropriate bed assignment and prevention of healthcare overflow, but it also can potentially improve patients' outcomes by earlier initiation of preventive and management measures. patients to a higher level of care; resources are thereby conserved and preventive and management measures more expeditiously initiated. Besides, these markers could be used to potentially enroll appropriate patients in much-needed clinical trials to find the proper treatment for this deadly disease.",

            "text": "While this paper is timely and adds significant value to the current and growing literature on the topic, there remain some unresolved questions that should be addressed in future investigations. The assessment of oxygen saturation in the arterial blood (PaO2) when it is estimated by pulse oximetry should be carefully interpreted. Estimated oxygen saturation by cooximeters (SpO2) could be different from measured arterial oxygen saturation by about \u00b14% 9 . Therefore, validating the results of Xie et al. findings by measured arterial oxygen saturation could be the next step. Furthermore, to be able to correctly assess the lung capacity for gas exchange, knowing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is a necessity. Achieving this information may be challenging in some clinical scenarios. For example, the estimates of FiO2 when nasal cannula or face masks are used may be very variable (e.g., when 2 liters by nasal cannula is used, FiO2 could vary between 24-35% depending on the tidal volume patients demand) 9, 10 . Therefore, in the next models for prediction of mortality among patients with COVID-19, using the ratio between SPO2 or PaO2 and FiO2 may be necessary. It is also essential to assess the correlation between lung gas exchange capacity and mortality in light of different phenotypes of ARDS (i.e., L vs. H phenotypes). When V/Q mismatch drives hypoxia, the delivery of higher FiO2 leads to higher PaO2 and SpO2 (L phenotype). In contrast, when shunt drives the hypoxia, the impact of FiO2 on the improvement of oxygen saturation would be less evident 5, 6 .",

            "text": "In this edition of Mayo Clinic Proceedings, Xie et al. reported the results of a retrospective cohort study of 140 patients with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 who presented with relevant signs and symptoms, with positive COVID-19 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test present in the majority of patients. These patients received medical attention in the hospital or ICU in medical centers in Beijing, China, over one month that study was conducted 8 . The authors reported low SpO2 (with the cutoff of 90%) after receiving oxygen support along with the presence of dyspnea to be strong predictors of mortality. Additionally, they described leukocytosis with a left shift along with C-reactive protein levels as possible predictors of mortality inCOVID-19 patients. This study is commendable for being able to identify clinical and laboratory markers of outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypoxia and dyspnea are both signs of lung involvement by the SARS-CoV2 virus. These results mirror the pathophysiologic processes of viral pneumonia, which, in turn, could result in worse outcomes. These markers are readily available at the bedside and could enhance the feasibility of appropriate and quick triage of COVID-19",
