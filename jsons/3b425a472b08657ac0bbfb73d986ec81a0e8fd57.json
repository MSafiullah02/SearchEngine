The unenveloped capsids had a mean diameter of 100 nm (range 85-110 nm) with subunits of about 9 nm in diameter. Where stain had penetrated into the middle of a particle tlie subunits appeared as hollow tubes and this gave a castellated edge to the periphery of the capsid (Fig. 4a) . Surface details were not seen clearly enough to establish the exact structure but the arrangement of subiniits was very similar to that of the members of the herpes group. Despite careful searching and the use of standard staining conditions, details of the surface structure were never as clearly as they are on herpes simplex virus (Fig. 3a) . Enveloped particles had a surface of i^etal shaped spikes resembling those of coronaviruses. Their 18 nm length the spacing between them were the same as the spikes seen in thin sections of Slant cells. Frequently, the envelope was drawn out into a tail giving a tadpole b .tfi.\"f''' appearance to the particle. An intact envelope appeared to be impervious to the stain and this prevented the surface details of the capsid being seen (Fig. 4a ).",

Ultrastructural evidence of cellular fusion came from observations of desmosomes at the junctions between giant cells and the surrounding Malpighian cells (Pig. lc). Cook & Stevens (1970) found isolated desmosomes in the cytoplasm of cells infected with varicella zoster virus and interpreted this as evidence of virus-induced cell fusion. Further, apparently normal Malpighian cell nuclei were found within the cytoplasm of these giant cells but without the envelope of the giant cell nucleus. This suggested that nuclear recruitment was taking place and that giant cell nuclei were formed by the fusion of several nuclei following dissolution of the common membranes between the Malpighian cells. This is similar to the social behaviour of cells in cell (e) Tailed, enveloped virus. The envelope was frequently drawn out into a long tail during the preparative processes for negative staining.",

For example, the osmiophilic granules seen in the cytoplasm of some giant cells (Fig. la) corresponded m size and number to the Feulgen positive and occasionally PAS positive granules seen by light microscopy. Our ultrastructural observations showed that these granules consisted of membrane-bound clumps of enveloped viruses embedded in a finely granular electron-dense matrix. Similarly, the dense basophilic and Feulgen positive coarse granules described as one type of intranuclear inclusion could be correlated with dense paracrystalline arrays of unenveloped capsids enclosed within the nucleus of giant cells (Fig. 2a & c) . The second type of intranuclear inclusion which consisted of eosinophilic, Feulgen negative bodies could be correlated with utoastructural observations of areas in the nucleus devoid of virus particles and chromatin and containing only highly dispersed granular material. It seems probable that these inclusions were areas where former intense viral replication had exhausted the contents or a nucleus. Similar intranuclear inclusions in cell monolayers infected with herpes simplex virus have been described as scars left by earlier viral multiplication (Dulbecco & Eisen 1973) . These intranuclear inclusions were considered by Pereira (1961) to be the most characteristic of the cellular lesions caused by vii-uses of the herpes group.",

Similar aggregations were observed in the cytoplasm of some giant cells and these bore a close resemblance to those described by McGavran & Smith (1965) who showed that clumping was due to virus-cell interaction. They noted that host cell lysosomes surround, engulf and obscure many cytomegaloviruses within the cytoplasm. Similar observations were made by Reubner, Hirano, Slusser, Osborn & Medearis (1966) of cytomegaloviruses embedded in electron-dense material having many of the characteristics of lysosomes suggesting that a host-cell reaction against virus produced in its own nucleus may have taken place. They considered that this reaction could be pathogenetically important in long term infections. The present study has shown that membrane-bound aggregates of virus in giant cells show the virus in differing stages of dismemberment and decay as though under attack from lysosomal enzymes. Further cytochemical studies are required to determine the nature of the matrix that surrounds the viruses.",

However, the outer layer of spikes on the envelope appears to be unique to Herpesvirus scophthalmi in that they are approximately twice as long as those reported by Wildy, Russell & Home (1960) The other architectural components of the virus were typical of the herpesvirus group as a whole. In a review, Roizman & Spear (1971) noted that there is general agreement that the typical herpes virion consists of a core 25-30 nm in diameter, a capsid consisting of 162 capsomeres and an envelope (with or without spikes) and thus can be defined as an enveloped nucleocapsid. The present study has shown that the turbot virus possessed a core having a diameter of 25-30 nm and that was compatible with a toroid when seen in thin section. The core was bound by a capsid that was frequently hexagonal in outline and having a mean diameter of 100 nm and a definite substructure of hollow capsomeric units. These were less well defined than in most herpesviruses but they were comparable in size and number to the characteristic hollow herpesvirus capsomeres.",
