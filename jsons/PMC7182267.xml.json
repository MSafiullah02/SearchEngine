The family includes many arthropod- and blood-borne viruses pathogenic to humans: The former is exemplified by members of the genus Flavivirus such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus, whereas the latter, by a member of the genus Hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV). As for Japanese encephalitis, it is estimated that approximately 70,000 cases occur annually in the 24 endemic countries [1]. The burden of yellow fever in Africa is estimated to be 84,000\u2013170,000 severe cases and 29,000\u201360,000 deaths per year [2]. Although approved human vaccines already exist for JEV, YFV, and dengue virus, there are no specific antiviral treatments against flavivirus infection so far.",

One representative cell culture system commonly used for flavivirus is the Vero cell line, which was established from African green monkey kidney cells [3, 4]. This cell line is susceptible to various types of viruses [5] as a result of the loss of the type I interferon (IFN) gene cluster [6, 7]. The Vero cell line is used as read-out cells for the plaque reduction neutralization test for dengue virus, as recommended by WHO [8], and other flaviviruses [9]. The cell line is also used as a substrate for the production of various vaccines [10], as exemplified by an inactivated vaccine against JEV (IXARO) [11].",

            "text": "In the case of HCV, two sublines of the human hepatoma HuH-7 cell line [12], Huh7.5 [13] and its derivative Huh7.5.1 [14], are highly permissive. These cell lines along with the HCV JFH1 isolate [15] can be used to reproduce the complete life cycle of the virus, and thereby have been widely used in HCV studies. The high permissiveness of the Huh7.5 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines is partly caused by mutational inactivation of retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I), a cellular DExD/H box RNA helicase that senses viral RNA to mediate antiviral signaling, by an amino acid change at codon 55 from threonine to isoleucine (T55I) [16]. This mutation abolishes the interaction between RIG-I and the mitochondria-bound adapter mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein [17], which is necessary to initiate a signaling cascade leading to the induction of type-I IFNs [18, 19]. Previously, we isolated a cell clone from Huh7.5.1 cells with greater permissiveness to HCV infection [20], because the Huh7.5.1 cells that we used had exhibited heterogeneous permissiveness. The clonal cell line designated as Huh7.5.1\u20138 produces 10-fold higher amounts of HCV than its parental Huh7.5.1 and shows phenotypically stable permissiveness to HCV infection, which is not changed even after 100 passages. However, the permissiveness of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells for flaviviruses, which are distantly-related to HCV, remains to be investigated.",

The cells were fixed with 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries; No. 133\u201310311) and stained with 0.0375% (w/v) methylene blue. Wells with 10\u2212100 plaques were used to calculate the virus titer in plaque formation units (PFU). For the comparative plaque assay, cells were similarly grown and infected, but overlaid with 2.5 ml per well of DMEM (Nissui Pharmaceuticals; No. 05919) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) NaHCO3, 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque; No. 04260\u201364), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1.25% (w/v) methylcellulose. JEV plaque formation in Vero cells was not so different between the DMEM overlay medium and the EMEM overlay medium (S1B Fig). After fixation and staining, plates were scanned with a document scanner, and image data were obtained (S11 Fig). To improve plaque visibility, an invert filter was applied to the image data, and highlights were adjusted using Photoshop Elements (version 14; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).",

Cells were infected with JEV (Nakayama strain, unless otherwise noted), and then the amount of infectious virus particles (titer) in culture supernatant and JEV-induced cell death were monitored during 1\u22124 d pi. The relative JEV titer of these cell lines increased and peaked at 2\u22123 d pi in a similar manner (Fig 1A). Under the same seeding conditions, doubling times of Huh7.5.1\u20138, Huh7.5.1, and HuH-7 cells were not significantly different (after Bonferroni correction, p > 0.0167) (S2B Fig). Thus, JEV production appeared to be comparable between the three cell lines and not enhanced in this lineage unlike for HCV production. In a parallel cell viability assay (Fig 1B), susceptibility to JEV-induced cell death was not greatly different between the three cell lines. Next, these cell lines were infected with JEV, overlaid with methylcellulose-containing medium, and then compared regarding JEV plaque formation. Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Huh7.5.1 cells similarly developed JEV plaques, whereas HuH-7 cells began to die at 3 d pi and detached from the surface of the well irrespective of infection at 5 d pi (Fig 1C). These results indicated that the Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines are better than the HuH-7 cell line for a JEV plaque assay. Although Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines were comparable in terms of JEV infection, the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line has the advantage of being phenotypically more stable than the Huh7.5.1 cell line [20]. Thus, we hereafter focused on the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line and compared it with the Vero cell line regarding JEV production.",

Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Vero cells under high and low confluency were infected with JEV at MOI 0.1, and then the virus titer in culture supernatant was monitored from 1 to 4 d pi (Fig 2). The culture supernatant of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells exhibited a higher relative virus titer than that of Vero cells, particularly during the early infection times. The difference in the relative virus titer was remarkable in high-cell-density infection (Fig 2A) compared with low-cell-density infection (Fig 2B), implying that cell-cell contacts promote viral spread in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells. The difference in the titer was not accounted for by the growth rates of the two cell lines, because their doubling times under high confluency conditions were nearly equal (S2 Fig). A parallel viability assay showed that Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells lost viability faster than Vero cells irrespective of cell density (Fig 3). The same trends were observed in JEV production and cell viability at smaller MOI (0.01), although high confluency appeared to be needed (S5 Fig). These results showed that JEV production in the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line is higher than that in the Vero cell line during early infection times and that the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line is more susceptible to JEV-induced cell death than the Vero cell line.",

The reason for large variations found at 2 and 3 d pi remains unknown, but that at 3 d pi may have been partly due to variable amounts of non-infectious viral RNA leaking from dead Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells (Fig 3). In a representative experiment (S6 Fig), the actual value of the particle-to-PFU ratio was minimally ~600, which is roughly consistent with a previous report [26].

Similarly, the level of extracellular viral RNA from Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells rose earlier than that from Vero cells (Fig 5B [a]). Although the level of intracellular viral RNA was not different between the two cell lines after 12 h pi (Fig 5A [b]), the level of extracellular viral RNA was higher for Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells than for Vero cells during 12\u221248 h pi (Fig 5B [b]). Furthermore, the relative amount of extracellular viral RNA expressed as a percentage of the total (extracellular plus intracellular) amount of viral RNA was about 2-fold higher in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells than in Vero cells at 1 d pi (Fig 6). Thereafter, the value for Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells varied with each experiment, possibly due to variation in virus-induced cell death, but leading to no difference between the values for Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Vero cells. Thus, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells may release JEV more efficiently than Vero cells at least at 1 d pi. Collectively, these results suggested that rapid viral replication kinetics and efficient early virus release contribute to high JEV production in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells.",

In the course of the infection, plaques in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells grew more rapidly than those in Vero cells. Similar results were observed when the cells were infected with another JEV strain, rAT (Fig 7B and S7B Fig). These results showed that the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line supports more rapid JEV plaque formation than the Vero cell line. The rapid plaque formation in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells appears to reflect their high JEV productivity and susceptibility to JEV-induced cell death. The plaque numbers of the Nakayama strain at 5 d pi were comparable between the two cell lines (Fig 7A and S7A Fig), whereas those of the rAT strain tended to be higher in the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line than in the Vero cell line (Fig 7B and S7B Fig).

The culture supernatant of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells exhibited a higher YFV titer than that of Vero cells during early infection times, as shown by three independent experiments (Fig 8A and 8B and S8 Fig). Because variations between experiments performed on different days were too large, the YFV titer ratio of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells to Vero cells was calculated on each time point, and the mean of the three experiments was taken (Fig 8C and 8D). The combined data showed that virus yield in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells was significantly higher than that in Vero cells for high confluency at 2 d pi and low confluency at 1 and 2 d pi. Furthermore, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells were more susceptible to YFV-induced cell death than Vero cells (Fig 8E and 8F), as observed with JEV. These results suggested that the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line, compared with the Vero cell line, has a higher virus productivity and susceptibility to virus-induced cell death upon flavivirus infection. Next, we compared the YFV plaque formation between the two cell lines (Fig 9 and S9 Fig). YFV plaques began to appear at 4 d pi in both cell lines. Although plaques in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells were slightly smaller than those in Vero cells, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells developed a several fold higher number of YFV plaques than Vero cells. These results suggested that the high YFV productivity and susceptibility to YFV-induced cell death of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells can be mainly attributed to their high infection efficiency. Although YFV plaques developed in Vero cells at 4 d pi in Fig 9, no cell death was observed with these cells at this time point in Fig 8E and 8F. A possible explanation for this discrepancy in cell death may be the difference in culture conditions: The serum concentration was 10% for Fig 8 and 2% for Fig 9. In addition, the medium for Fig 9 contained methylcellulose. These differences may have affected Vero cell death. In the case of JEV, the lower the serum concentration is, the more cell death occurs [27].",

To confirm whether the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line is defective in RIG-I, we amplified the RIG-I cDNA derived from total RNA isolated from HuH-7, Huh7.5.1 and Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells. An amplicon corresponding to the expected size for the RIG-I sequence (~ 3 kbp) and another, with a smaller size (~ 2 kbp), were detected in the three cell lines (Fig 10A) and directly sequenced (Fig 10B). The 3-kbp and 2-kbp cDNAs from the HuH-7 cell line exclusively contained the wild-type codon 55. In contrast, the 3-kbp cDNAs from the Huh 7.5.1 and Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell lines contained the mutant-type codon 55, whereas the 2-kbp cDNAs from these cell lines contained the wild-type codon 55. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs of HuH-7 and Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell lines revealed that the 3-kbp cDNAs were full-length (FL1, 2), whereas the 2-kbp cDNAs lacked exons 6\u221212 (SV1 found in both cell lines) or 5\u221212 (SV2 found in Huh7.5.1\u20138) (Fig 10C and S10 Fig). RIG-I protein isoforms deduced from the splice variants (SV1, 2) completely lacked a helicase ATP-binding domain, indicating that they are defective like RIG-I protein with a mutated ATP-binding site [28]. These results were consistent with the above findings [25] and indicated that Huh7.5.1\u20138 is a RIG-I null mutant cell line.",

Even the ancestral HuH-7 cell line was comparable except for plaque formation. These findings indicate that genetic factors contributing to the high permissiveness of the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line to HCV infection are specific rather than broadly proviral. One such genetic factor might be involved in stable HCV receptor expression [20]. Unlike the Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, the HuH-7 cell line was not maintained under our culture conditions for the plaque assay (Fig 1C), likely because our HuH-7 cells had a lower fitness to cell culture than Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Huh7.5.1 cells.",

First, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells produced higher amounts of infectious JEV and YFV than Vero cells early in infection (Figs 2 and 8A\u20138D). In the case of JEV, the high virus productivity of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells may be attributed not to the increase in infectivity of a virus particle (Fig 4), but to viral rapid replication kinetics and efficient virus release early in infection (Figs 5 and 6). Therefore, Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells are more suitable than Vero cells for obtaining large amounts of flavivirus in a short period of time. Recently, HuH-7 cells were shown to produce higher amounts of Zika virus than other cells including Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) early in infection [29]. Considering that JEV production in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells and the ancestral HuH-7 cells were comparable (Fig 1A), high virus productivity early in flavivirus infection may be a common feature among the HuH-7 lineage. In addition, a similar trend was observed when HuH-7 cells were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [30]. Thus, the feature may not be limited to flavivirus infection.",

These characteristics of the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line may facilitate cell viability-based screenings of antiviral host factors and agents for flaviviruses. Meanwhile, the potent cell death observed in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells appears to be a part of the reason for plateaued or reduced virus production late in infection. Therefore, genetic engineering of the Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell line to make it less susceptible to virus-induced cell death might yield a cell line with more flavivirus production.",

The JEV plaque phenotype of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells appears to reflect their high virus productivity and susceptibility to virus-induced cell death. Because a plaque assay is somewhat time-consuming, the plaque phenotype observed with JEV infection in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells can be utilized to shorten the period of plaque assay. In addition, the high-number plaque phenotype observed with YFV infection in Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells can be utilized to improve the sensitivity of detection and titration of YFV by plaque assay. Vero cells may be more suitable to viruses requiring long-term cultivation to grow plaques, because they were more tolerant to our plaque assay conditions than Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells. In addition, the higher tolerance of Vero cells to flavivirus-induced cell death, compared with Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells, may be a feature that makes the Vero cell line advantageous for vaccine production.",

Our results suggested that, in a Huh7.5.1\u20138 cell, one allele of the RIG-I gene generates full-length mRNA with a T55I mutation that abolishes RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling, whereas the other allele generates defective splice variants without the mutation. One of the splice variants is also expressed in the parental HuH-7 cell line. Codon 55 of RIG-I gene of Huh7.5.1 cells was heterozygous as was that of Huh7.5.1\u20138 cells, showing that the heterozygosity of the codon was stable at least during the time span for isolation of the Huh7.5.1\u20138 clone from Huh7.5.1 cells. At present, the underlying mechanisms that generate splice variants and their impacts on RIG-I signaling remain to be studied. Although JEV has been restricted by RIG-I in a mouse model [31] and mouse cell lines [32, 33], JEV production and susceptibility to JEV-induced cell death were not dramatically altered in the Huh7.5.1\u20138 and Huh7.5.1 cell lines compared with the HuH-7 cell line (Fig 1A and 1B), implying that the RIG-I pathway may not work or may be counteracted by viral mechanisms [34] under our experimental conditions.",
