To delay the rapid increase in T lymphocytes, additional dexamethasone (0.9 mg/kg) was given. On day 3 after BMT, aspergillus antigen was detected in the endotracheal secretions. The dose of liposomal amphotericin was increased from 3 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day and since there was no improvement on day 7 this was changed to voriconazole.

At autopsy, aspergillus pneumonia was detected in the right lower lobe and bronchopneumonia in the left lower lobe. In addition, there was a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of cytotoxic donor lymphocytes. These lymphocytes represented an overwhelming response of EBV-specific cytotoxic donor T cells in the face of the EBV load. Acute trapping of these lymphocytes in the lungs contributed to the diffusion capacity blockage with the result that the patient could not be adequately oxygenated by mechanical ventilation and ultimately died. ARDS has also been described in patients receiving donor T cells to control EBV-associated LPD.11 It may be speculated whether earlier administration of dexamethasone, a higher dose or the use of low-dose cyclosporine could have delayed the overwhelming CD8 response. In addition, rituximab may have helped to reduce the EBV load before transplantation in order to reduce the risk of overwhelming T cell expansion post BMT.",

With this regimen, we achieved rapid and effective eradication of LPD and HLH. However, an explosive expansion of CD8+ lymphocytes and the resulting interstitial infiltration may exacerbate pulmonal insufficiency.",
