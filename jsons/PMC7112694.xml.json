Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome sequences showed that the virus was a novel coronavirus with close genetic relatedness to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV-HKU5) discovered in the lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese Pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus abramus) of Hong Kong, China respectively.4, 5, 6, 7 Closely related coronaviruses have also been found in other bat species in Europe and Ghana.8, 9 The second case was a 49-year-old man from Qatar who kept camels and sheep in his farm and had a travel history to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before symptom onset.1, 10 He developed severe acute community-acquired pneumonia and acute renal failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in an intensive care unit of London. The lower respiratory tract samples were positive for coronavirus using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. The 250 bp PCR fragments of the viral isolates in the first 2 cases showed 99.5% sequence homology with only 1 nucleotide mismatch over the regions compared.10 Subsequently, 15 more laboratory-confirmed cases of HCoV-EMC infection were reported in the Middle East and the United Kingdom with a total of 9 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2 in Qatar, 2 in Jordan, 1 in United Arab Emirates and 3 in the United Kingdom.2, 3 Most of the cases developed severe pneumonia, at least 6 cases had concomitant acute renal failure, and 11 cases died. This unusually high crude fatality rate of over 50% and the severe clinical manifestations of acute respiratory and renal failure are unique among human coronavirus infections.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\n",

As with other highly pathogenic viruses which are capable of causing epidemics such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and avian H5N1 influenza A virus, an animal source of the virus leading to interspecies jumping to humans is possible.7, 11, 19, 20, 21, 22 This hypothesis is supported by the epidemiological link to animal exposure in some of these patients with laboratory-confirmed HCoV-EMC infection,1, 3 the close phylogenetic relatedness between HCoV-EMC and Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5,5, 6 and the broad species tropism of HCoV-EMC in different animal cells including bat, primate, swine, civet, and rabbit.23, 24 Human-to-human transmission appears to be limited at this stage with only 4 epidemiologically-linked clusters being identified so far. The Jordanian cluster was retrospectively traced back to April 2012 with no further evidence of spread. Moreover, none of 2400 residents in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had serum antibody against HCoV-EMC.4 Thus, HCoV-EMC is likely different from other human coronaviruses associated with mild respiratory tract infections, namely HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 which account for 5\u201330% of all respiratory infections with up to 21.6% of the general population having serum antibodies.25, 26 Rather, it may be similar to SARS-CoV which crossed species barriers from its natural bat reservoir to intermediate amplification animal hosts and humans and caused severe infection or subclinical non-pneumonic infection in about 0.5% of the general population.12\n",

Four of the 28 SARS patients had paired acute and convalescent sera available for comparison (Table 3\n). The anti-HCoV-EMC IF IgG titer rose from <1:20 in the acute sera to 1:40 and 1:320 in the convalescent sera in 2 of these patients, while there was no significant rise in the other two. These patients also had 4-fold rise in IF antibody titer against another human betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43.",

There was a positive correlation between the antibody titers against the SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC using both the indirect IF and neutralization antibody tests. The finding of cross-reactive IF antibodies was not that unexpected because these could be induced by cross-reactive epitopes against structural proteins such as the nucleoprotein which is the most abundant structural protein in the coronaviruses as we had previously reported.38 Indeed, cross-reactive antibodies among human betacoronaviruses by IF are well known, and have made large scale surveillance studies and epidemiologic surveys of human coronavirus infections difficult.39 On the other hand, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies among betacoronaviruses have rarely been reported except between the closely related human and palm civet SARS-CoVs.40 The significant neutralizing antibody titers against HCoV-EMC in SARS patients' sera in this study were surprising because neutralization is generally considered as the most specific serological test. Our previous surveillance study showed that anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody in our population was extremely low despite a high seroprevalence of anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 antibodies.12 Zaki and colleagues also failed to detect cross-reactive anti-HCoV-EMC antibodies among 2400 patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who likely also had serum anti-HCoV-OC43 and/or anti-HCoV-HKU1 antibodies. Furthermore, none of the 152 healthy blood donors in the present study had serum anti-HCoV-EMC antibodies detected by indirect IF and neutralization. Therefore we assessed the structural homologies between these betacoronaviruses for possible explanations of the observed cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies.",

All betacoronaviruses use the S protein for attachment and fusion of the virion with the host cell membrane. Trimers of the S protein form the peplomers that radiate from the lipid envelope and give the virus a characteristic corona solis-like appearance under the electron microscope. The spike protein ectodomain consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The S1 domain contains the receptor binding domain and is responsible for recognition and binding to the host cell receptor. The S1 fragment between amino acids 318 and 510 is the receptor binding domain for ACE2 in the case of SARS-CoV. However, the homology of S1 between SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC is low with only 16.6% amino acid identity. Indeed, this region is generally more divergent relative to the S2 region for coronaviruses. Hence, while the S1 region induces the majority of the neutralizing antibody in convalescent sera of SARS patients,43, 44 it would be unlikely to result in antibodies with significant cross-neutralizing activity.",

            "text": "The S2 domain, responsible for fusion, contains the putative fusion peptide and the heptad repeat HR1 and HR2. The binding of S1 to the cellular receptor will trigger conformational changes which collocates the fusion peptide upstream of the two heptad repeats of S2 to the transmembrane domain, and, finally, fusion of the viral and cellular lipid envelopes. An epitope situated between amino acids 1055 to 1192 and around heptad repeat 2 of the S2 subunit is likely to have induced the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody against HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV.63 Our phylogenetic and antigenic epitope analysis suggested that this area is highly conserved among these 4 betacoronaviruses and therefore could not completely explain the presence of cross-reactive anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies among SARS patients but not the general population. We postulate that in addition to the structural homologies between HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the different clinical manifestations and subsequent host immunological response of these infections may account for this pattern of neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity. While SARS-CoV causes severe infection with viremia,45 HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 predominantly cause superficial mucosal infections of the upper respiratory tract which is self-limiting. Therefore unlike the highly virulent SARS-CoV or HCoV-EMC which can induce a solid humoral immune response, an insufficient B cell maturation process with failure to induce high avidity antibodies is more likely to occur with other betacoronavirus infections in the general population but their neutralizing antibody titer against these less virulent betacoronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 can be boosted with superimposed SARS-CoV or HCoV-EMC infections (Table 2). These viral, clinical and immunological differences may explain the absence of cross-reactive neutralizing antibody against both SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC in normal blood donors despite that most of them should have been exposed to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the past. Our finding has important implications in the serodiagnostic testing, treatment and development of vaccine for the prevention of human infection caused by betacoronaviruses. The possibility of cross-reactive antibodies giving rise to false-positive results concurs with the suggestion of a recent report to use anti-HCoV-EMC IF antibody test only in patients with very clear epidemiological linkage.46 Besides the possibility of wrong serodiagnosis due to cross-reactivity, this observation would support the use of antiviral peptides in the treatment of this emerging HCoV-EMC infection as antiviral peptides targeting the heptad repeat 2 has been successfully used in neutralizing SARS-CoV in cell culture.47 Furthermore, this antigenic epitope could be an important vaccine target though the danger of immunopathology must also be considered. The possibility of low level neutralizing antibody leading to immune enhancement should also be considered if SARS convalescent plasma or normal intravenous immunoglobulin are used for the treatment of HCoV-EMC infection.48\n",

However, most of the positive anti-HCoV-EMC IgG titers in this group were of high values between 1:80 to 1:160 which made the results less ambiguous. It would be interesting to test a larger group of laboratory-confirmed SARS patients with different viral strains to substantiate our observation. Second, the low seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV in the general population make the possibility of wrong serodiagnostics due to cross-reactivity less important for routine diagnostics. However, the finding is essential for confirmation of serological surveillance studies especially in some Southeast Asian countries including China where the seroprevalence for anti-SARS-CoV may not be well established, as HCoV-EMC may continue to spread and cause an epidemic in this densely populated area in the future.",
