Three examples of pathogens that are current causes for human health concern are avian influenza viruses, West Nile virus (WNV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [1]. SARS is a newly described respiratory infection with a potential threat to the health of people throughout the world. The etiological agent is a novel coronavirus (CoV), the SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV). The first SARS case was identified in Foshan municipality on November 16, 2002, in Guangdong (GD) Province, China. The patterns of spread of SARS suggest droplet and contact transmission. Close proximity of persons and handling of human secretions (respiratory secretions, faeces, and the like) enhance the risk for transmission [2]. Because of its relative high transmissibility and mortality, SARS raised a great concern over the public health. Epidemiological investigations showed that a total of 8422 probable cases, with 916 deaths were reported from 29 countries during the outbreak (data at August 7, 2003), while World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the last chain of human transfusion was broken on July 5, 2003 [3].",

The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV through blood and blood products is unknown. The possibility of viremia before the onset of clinical symptoms and/or after symptom resolution remains an important concern regarding blood safety. Mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections can occur as documented by seroconversion in healthcare workers (HCWs) and animal traders [4], [5], [6]. In April 2003, Drosten et al. reported that viral RNA was detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute symptomatic phase of infection [7]. In 2004, Singapore researchers reported that SARS-CoV can be detected in the blood of infected patients [8], and, also in 2004, Woo et al. investigated the relative rates of non-pneumonic SARS-CoV infection (mildly symptomatic infections, not asymptomatic cases) and SARS-CoV pneumonia [9]. In 2005, Taiwan researchers first reported that the patterns of viremia differ among different SARS patients and that some patients have a more protracted viremia [10]. Therefore, although there are no confirmed reports of the transmission of SARS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals, and we are unaware that SARS-CoV has been transmitted by the transfusion of blood components, the possibility of such transmission during a donor\u2019s viremic phase is at least theoretically possible.",

Patients with a mild course of SARS recover approximately 10 days after the development of clinical symptoms [12]. Antibodies to SARS-CoV were measured in patients on day 16 of the disease [7], [13], and NAT may therefore be the only way to identify patients with mild symptoms or in the early phase of disease who might nevertheless be viremic [7], [14]. Therefore, persons with SARS could potentially be viremic before the onset of symptoms and/or after symptom resolution. Transmission of SARS-CoV via human cells, tissues, cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) recovered during these time periods may be possible [15]. Because SARS occurred in 2002 and 2003 suddenly and disappeared quickly, however, data on SARS viremia prior to symptom onset is very rare. Our risk estimate is theoretical and would overestimate the true risk if viremia does not develop before symptom onset.",

Guangdong is where the first case of SARS was identified, followed by 1511 clinically confirmed cases, including 58 deaths; of the 1511 confirmed cases, 46 lived in Shenzhen [2]. We first estimated how many of the 46 infected individuals with known symptom onset dates were viremic at each time point throughout the outbreak period. This was done using a statistical resampling approach that incorporated these 46 symptom onset dates, an assumed distribution of the length of the time between the onset of viremia and the onset of symptoms, and an estimated distribution of the length of viremia. The assumed distribution of the duration between onset of viremia and symptom onset was derived from data on the incubation period of SARS and the timing of viremia onset relative to symptom onset during this incubation period [10]. The estimated distribution of the duration of viremia was derived using data from an extensive seroprevalence study and mass screening for detection of subclinical and non-pneumonic infection in Hongkong [9]. We assumed that the dates of infection of 46 individuals with known symptom onset dates were similar to those of all Shenzhen residents who became infected that year. We then used the estimate of the number of viremic cases over time to infer the number of asymptomatic, viremic SARS-CoV infections in the population over time by using seroepidemiologic survey results from Guangdong CDC and Hongkong that provided estimates of the proportion of SARS-CoV-infected individuals who are clinically confirmed and of the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections. Finally, we used the population size of Shenzhen, Guangdong province (4,670,000, http://www.demographia.com) to scale the estimated number of viremic, asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections in the population to estimate the risk or probability of a SARS-CoV infected blood donation.",

WHO reported the incubation period as follows [3]: the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean and variance of the time from infection to onset were 6.37 days and 16.69 days, respectively (95% CI 5.29\u20137.75); therefore 95% of the patients would experience the onset of symptoms within 14.22 days of infection, based on the assumption that the incubation period followed a gamma distribution. There is approximately a 1\u20132-day lag between infection with the virus and the detection of virus in the blood [10], [14] so that the duration from onset of viremia to symptom onset is roughly 1\u20132 days shorter than the incubation period.",

Next, simulated viremia time spans were computed for each case. To do this, the onset of viremia, relative to the case onset time, was chosen by taking a random sample from an assumed distribution for the duration from infection to symptom onset, based on the historic information provided above. The duration of viremia was then chosen by taking a random sample (with replacement) of the duration times from the data obtained in Taiwan [10]. We have assumed in this procedure that the relative timing and duration of viremia for a case is independent of the symptom onset time. Next, to reflect uncertainty in R, a random deviate r from the gamma distribution with mean R\n = 17.44 and variance Var[R] = 100.9 [9] was generated, and each case\u2019s simulated viremia time was replicated [[r]] + 1 times to reflect the number of viremic individuals in the population over time. (Here, [[r]] denotes the largest integer in r.) Subsequently, to discount viremia times for symptomatic infections and account for uncertainty in A, a random deviate, a, from a beta distribution with mean A\n = 7.50 \u00d7 10\u22123 and variance Var[A] = 1.86 \u00d7 10\u22125\n[10] was generated, and a random proportion a of the replicated viremia times were truncated to their onset times.

Our results indicate a small but non-zero risk of SARS-CoV transmission from transfusion of blood components during an epidemic, at least theoretically. Based on data from different published literature, we calculated that during an epidemic of SARS in Shenzhen in 2003, the risk peaked at approximately 23.57 per million donations in late March/early April, with a mean risk over the course of the outbreak of 14.11 per million donations. The calculated risk was highly limited in time, with the near-zero or zero risk among donations before February and after August, during times of no reported community SARS-CoV transmissions in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. There were 10,766 donations in Shenzhen during the time of the epidemic, so based on our average risk estimate of 14.11 per million donations, the expected number of infected donations is 0.152 (1 in 71,000). Further, based on a simple binomial model, the probability that there was at least one infected donation in the 10,766 donations made is 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 14.11/1,000,000)10,766\n = 0.14, or roughly 14%.",

These measures included: (1) new questions were added to the donor questionnaire about predonation contact history with suspected SARS patients or people with contact history with SARS; (2) normal body temperature was added as a criterion for donor qualification; (3) all donors were required to notify the blood collection facilities if fever, cough, or other suspected SARS symptoms occurred within two weeks after donation; and (4) a SARS-CoV antibody testing research project was soon started using available tests on donor samples [20].",

Lessons learned from West Nile virus [18] and SARS-CoV in transplantation should be applicable to future outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases [21]. In the meantime, on the basis of current knowledge a return of SARS cannot be ruled out. Particularly, the origin of the virus is assumed to be the civet cat, which could not be quarantined [22]. Furthermore, the existence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections and the detection of SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection suggest that the transmission of the SARS-CoV by transfusion is at least theoretically possible. Our analyses suggest, however, that this probability is very low during an outbreak similar in magnitude to the one in Shenzhen in 2003, with a maximum estimated risk of 23.57 per million donations. In case SARS does recur, preventive measures considered during the epidemic should include strategies for blood donor recruitment, and the estimates we provide herein may be used in a quantitative evaluation of such measures. The quantification of these effects will likely not be available unless and until SARS recurs.",
