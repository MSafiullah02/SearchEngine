The study period included January 2017 through March 2018. We defined the pre\u2013respiratory panel system implementation period as January 2016 through December 2016 (12 months) and the post\u2013respiratory panel system implementation period as January 2017 through March 2018. We had 200 multiplex PCR kits, of which 22 were used for rapid PCR respiratory panel system calibration; the remaining 178 kits were aimed for use among the study patients. However, at the planned end date of the study, we could not reach the target sample size. Therefore, a 3-month extension in the experimental group was made to collect sufficient samples. The trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research at each participating center.",

Eligible patients received a rapid molecular test with 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. The results of the respiratory panel or PCT tests were communicated to the treating physicians directly by the study nurse as soon as they were available and were kept in the medical records. The study nurse reminded the treating physician of the recommendation of antibiotic treatment based on different viral and PCT testing results. The detection of influenza initiates isolation or neuraminidase inhibitor use. The detection of a virus with an elevated serum PCT level (\u22650.25 ng/mL) may indicate the possibility of a superimposed bacterial infection and justify the continual use of antibacterial treatment in patients with non\u2013influenza virus infection and combined antiviral and antibacterial treatment in patients with influenza infection. A positive result for respiratory virus with a low serum PCT level and stable clinical manifestation may allow early discontinuation or de-escalation of empiric antibiotics. De-escalation was defined as changing to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic or shifting the intravenous antibiotics to oral form. A negative respiratory virus test result with a low serum level of PCT (<0.25 ng/mL) would prompt clinicians to consider noninfectious causes of respiratory distress, such as acute exacerbation of obstructive airway disease, acute decompensated heart failure, or fluid overload.",

The database included the following: demographics, clinical presentations, presenting viral signs, laboratory data, image results, ED and admission, medications used in the ED and hospitalization course, and discharge status.

PS was defined as the conditional probability of being tested with respiratory panel and PCT, which was derived from the logistic regression model that included the following potential predictors: demographics, comorbidity, presenting vital signs, laboratory results, and admission diagnoses. To verify the balancing of baseline covariates after PS matching, we made a standardized difference plot to ensure minimum differences in the baseline covariates between 2 groups of patients (Supplementary Figure 1). In the PS-matched cohort, we compared the outcome between the current cohort and the PS-matched historical cohort using the logistic regression model, adjusting for the residual difference in the baseline covariates.

Respiratory panel testing was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use. However, they did not find that routine use of respiratory panel testing could reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics, which they ascribed to the initiation of antibiotics before the results of PCT in many patients. A pre-post study showed that the use of the respiratory panel decreased the time to diagnosis of respiratory viruses, hospital admission rate, length of stay, number of chest radiographs, and duration of antimicrobial use.13 Gelfer et al21 combined the respiratory panel and PCT tests, but found no significant differences in overall antibiotic exposure between the experimental and standard-of-care groups. Nevertheless, they found significantly fewer patients discharged on antibiotics and a shorter duration of therapy in a subgroup of patients with positive viral and negative PCT testing results.

Historically, it has been advised to complete the course of intravenous antibiotics treatment despite the resolution of clinical symptoms. However, there is little evidence to support this practice.22\n,\n23 Overuse of antibiotics was associated with increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics may increase the risk of adverse drug events, organ dysfunction, or mortality.24 It is noteworthy that the identification of respiratory virus alone may not be sufficient to reduce antibiotic use because of the concerns regarding mixed virus-bacteria coinfection, especially influenza with pneumococcus infection.25 Low serum level of PCT may help alleviate the concerns of mixed infection. In addition, communicating the results to the treating physicians is important.13\n,\n16 Although we did not have a formal antibiotic stewardship team, the study nurse communicated the results to the treating physicians and promoted antibiotics stewardship. Another finding is the underdiagnosis of influenza in older adult patients. Older adult patients were less likely to undergo a provider-ordered influenza test. They usually lack the typical presentation of influenza-like illness and may present with respiratory distress or confusion.26 A recent study showed that the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical grounds alone was associated with a suboptimal sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 78%.27\n",

It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of NH residents received antibiotics each year, and up to 75% of the treatment is inappropriate. NHs become the reservoirs for resistant bacteria within a community.31 Although the present protocol cannot be implemented in NHs, it can be used among severe NH patients who are transferred to the ED. In a less severe outbreak, the nasopharyngeal samples of NH residents can be collected and sent to contracted laboratories for respiratory panel testing. The early detection of acute respiratory infection enables early isolation of infected patients and early antiviral drug administration, which can prevent or contain a respiratory virus infection outbreak.",

Previous analyses showed that rapid multiplex PCR testing was the most cost-effective testing strategy for the detection of influenza in children.12\n,\n32 The cost-effectiveness of respiratory panel testing is highly influenced by the prevalence of influenza and the proportion of patients treated with antivirals. The significant improvement in influenza diagnosis and antiviral treatment in our study suggests that a combination of respiratory panel and PCT testing may be cost-effective in our study setting. Such speculation, however, requires future validation.",

We cannot determine the impact of the viral panel and PCT tests separately. Second, the study nurse only enrolled patients during working hours of weekdays. Selection or spectrum bias is less likely because we did not find significant difference in the outcomes of patients presenting to the ED on different time shifts. Third, the postdischarge follow-up data of the historical comparison cohort cannot be retrieved. We therefore could not compare the duration of oral antibiotics between the 2 cohorts. The reduction of intravenous antibiotic duration alone is important because it has been shown to be a strong risk factor for the development of resistant bacteria strains. Fourth, the generalization of the results to other settings should be taken into consideration. The long hospitalization duration in our study was due to old age, severe illness, and low hospitalization cost.33\n,\n34 Lastly, the incidence of various respiratory viruses may have varied across the 2 seasons of the study period. The strengths of our study include the older adult population, the twin-center prospective cohort design, the simple antibiotic stewardship algorithm, and the comparison to a PS-matched cohort.",

Respiratory viral infection outbreak is common in nursing homes. Performing the proposed diagnostic approach on patients transferred from NHs may enable early detection of the causative pathogens and early isolation of infected patients. As the cost per test is still high, institutions should develop a protocol to prevent indiscriminate testing with multiplex PCR and provide proactive real-time feedback to treating physicians for antimicrobial stewardship.
