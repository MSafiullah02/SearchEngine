ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease involved in the homeostatic balance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and is expressed in a variety of tissues including the nasopharynx, lung, and intestines, accounting for COVID-19's symptomatology of respiratory and digestive distress and diarrhea [4,13]. There are myriad mechanisms working in concert that seed the clinical and pathologic features of COVID-19; this virus is endotheliotropic, damaging endothelium primarily through complement activation and also causing vascular thrombosis [14].",

            "text": "There is emerging body of literature and earlier evidence from the SARS-CoV era that the ACE2 entry mechanism, and the subsequent post entry deactivation of ACE2 plays an important role in COVID19 morbidity [14,15]. The ACE2 loss results in a pathologic increase in Angiotensin II over Angiotensin (1\u20137) tone systemically that leads, through their respective receptors AT1 and MAS, to complement activation, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis [[16], [17], [18]]. When ACE2 proteins are internalized and destroyed, or the cell hosting many such proteins are destroyed by the virus, the resultant imbalance of Angiotensin II and Angiotensin (1\u20137) in the blood decreases the activity of endothelial nitrous oxide synthase (eNOS) [19]. eNOS, a potent down-regulator of the production of tissue factor (TF) through nitrous oxide(NO), is also a well-known vasodilator [20]. Another effect of this angiotensin subtype imbalance is increasing NOX-2 activity, which produces radical oxygen species that causes cellular damage [21]. These inflammatory radical oxygen species react with and thereby are a mechanism for disabling NO, further increasing vasoconstriction [22]. The now contracted vessels associated with higher levels of TF and concurrent cellular damage from ROS made by NOX-2 creates a microenvironment conducive for inflammation and thrombosis [23].",

Complement deposition in major, blood-bathed organ systems can have systemic procoagulant effects. Complement activation product C3a activates platelets [26], and C5a increases the expression and activity of the potent coagulation initiator, tissue factor (TF), in both macrophages and the endothelium [[27], [28], [29]]. Reciprocally, there is the ability of FXa, thrombin, and FIXa to trigger the complement cascade by acting as independent C3 and C5 convertases [29] to create a feed forward mechanism. Uniquely fitting to the proposed MBL-pathway complement activation by SARS-CoV-2, MASP-2 can cleave prothrombin into thrombin [30].",

After central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes and ahead of lung alveolar cells, placental trophoblasts are the most densely packed TF-expressing cells [27]. PAI-2 is a procoagulant suicide-inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that is unique to the placental trophoblasts and to a far lesser extent, macrophages [31]. The inhibitor to fibrinolysis is nearly undetectable before pregnancy, and rises over the gravid course [32]. PAI-2 forms dense polymers in the placenta, and may be fragmented and activated by redox potential [33,34], and an important connection to the previously-discussed effect of Angiotensin II predominance on NOX-2 which produces oxidizing free radicals.",
