            "text": "Purpose of Review Emergency physicians generally have limited exposure to internationally acquired illnesses. However, travelers can present quite ill, and delays in recognition and treatment can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. This paper aims to summarize typical presentations of common international diseases and provide the emergency physician with a practical approach based on current guidelines. Recent Findings In the treatment of traveler's diarrhea, azithromycin has become the treatment of choice due to the growing antibiotic resistance. Intravenous artesunate was approved in 2019 under investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of severe malaria, and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have become the first-line treatment for most cases of uncomplicated malaria. Since the 2015 outbreak, Zika has become a concern to many travelers, but the current treatment is supportive. Summary Clinicians should be aware of a few noteworthy updates in the treatment of internationally acquired illnesses, but more importantly, they must recognize warning signs of severe illness and treat promptly. Future research on workup and disposition could help emergency physicians identify which patients need admission in well-appearing febrile travelers.",

Table 1 outlines the medications currently approved in the USA for malaria prophylaxis and specific considerations for each medication. & Standby emergency treatment (SBET): While chemoprophylaxis is the most efficacious in malaria prevention, SBET has also become an option for travelers who are traveling to low-risk areas who do not want to take chemoprophylaxis for the duration of their travel. Patients using this method should begin taking prescribed antimalarials if they develop a fever and seek a medical evaluation as soon as possible.",

Practitioners should remember to test for common local illness, particularly influenza during flu season, and cover for a broad range of illnesses in toxic-appearing patients. Workup is dependent on location and timing of travel to help determine which diseases are most likely. For cases in which many pathogens seem possible, we would recommend lab workup to include complete blood count with differential, basic metabolic panel; liver function tests; coagulation screen; blood smear; CK level; pregnancy test; influenza swab; blood cultures; urinalysis; urine culture; and chest x-ray. While many findings are nonspecific, these tests will likely identify patients with warning signs of severe illness and might help guide the practitioner toward the most likely pathogen.",

An elevated creatinine kinase can be useful in distinguishing leptospirosis from other diseases as it is elevated in up to 50% of patients [56] . CSF can show lymphocytic or neutrophilic pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein, and normal glucose. CSF culture is generally positive in the first 10 days of illness [20] . Chest x-ray should also be obtained for any respiratory symptoms due to risk of pulmonary hemorrhage and ARDS [20] . Most cases of leptospirosis are mild and can be managed outpatient with doxycycline (100 mg) or azithromycin (500 mg) [19, 25] . Patients with pulmonary involvement, CNS infection, jaundice, renal failure, or age over 60 are at highest risk of death [25, 26] and should be admitted and given IV doxycycline (100 mg), penicillin (1.5 million IUs), or a third-generation cephalosporin [19, 25] . Until Rickettsia is ruled out, doxycycline is generally recommended as the initial treatment. In patients with severe disease, corticosteroids can be considered, but recent studies have conflicting data on their benefit [27, 28] .",

Generally, patients will be discharged, and we recommend education surrounding transmission and pregnancy prevention.

Therefore, one must be aware of alternative treatments particularly for severely ill patients. In an otherwise undifferentiated febrile traveler, basic labs can be drawn to narrow the differential and screen for risk of development of severe disease. Recognition of development of severe disease is critical as these patients have high risk of complications and death.",
