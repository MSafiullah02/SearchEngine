On March 14, 2020, several reports raised concerns about whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen) could worsen symptoms of COVID-19. The French Health Minister alerted the public about concerns regarding the use of NSAIDs in patients with a fever and/or serological evidence of COVID-19 infection. This warning leads to a misleading statement that in the absence of information about serological status, NSAIDs should be proscribed. This raised concerns among the medical community, given the common use of NSAIDs in urological diseases [3]. NSAIDs are frequently used for pain, fever, and several common urological diseases (eg, simple renal colic) and are part of the perioperative management of urinary tract surgery and for symptom relief after vesical instillations. It is estimated that 30 million people per day worldwide take NSAIDs [4].",

            "text": "There is a sizeable body of literature suggesting that NSAIDs might alter the course of bacterial pneumonia, resulting in more invasive disease and complications and potentially leading to higher rates of admission to hospitals and intensive care units [5]. The balance between the leukotriene and prostaglandin pathways during acute inflammation/infection in humans is not well understood, and COX inhibitors may result either in an enhanced or a reduced bacterial host response. Similarly, concerns have been raised about the negative effects of NSAID exposure on the clinical course of viral infections. One of the mechanisms of action of SARS-CoV-2 involves binding to target cells through ACE2 protein. ACE2 is promoted by numerous epithelial cells, especially those in the lung and kidney. Fang et al [6] recently reported concerns about the impact of hypertension or diabetes mellitus on COVID-19. Treatments with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers are used for these diseases and lead to upregulation of ACE2. Similarly, owing to their pharmacological action, NSAIDs could also increase ACE2; it has been hypothesised that ACE2-stimulating drugs increase the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19 [6]. Conversely, administration of COX inhibitors significantly ameliorated mortality in an animal model of influenza H5N1 infection [7] and there was no evidence that NSAIDs influenced severe H1N1 mortality in a retrospective human cohort [8]. In addition, NSAIDs might be potential inhibitory factors for SARS-CoV [9] (which shares 99.8% sequence homology at the nucleotide level with SARS-CoV2 [10]) replication, suggesting NSAIDs could have both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity [9]. However, the exact role of COX inhibitors in the cytokine storm and pyroptosis observed for highly pathogenic human coronavirus has not yet been investigated [10].",

Nevertheless, physicians should rigorously screen for COVID-19 symptoms and inform patients before prescribing any medication. In the case of any doubt, NSAIDs should be avoided.
