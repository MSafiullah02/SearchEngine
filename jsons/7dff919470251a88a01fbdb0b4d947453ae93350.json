            "text": "Mathematical modeling is regularly used in order to analyze the dynamics of the propagation of diseases and predict future transmission trends. A number of studies using mathematical modeling have been performed for COVID-19, a significant majority focusing on transmission in China, Japan and the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the virus spread initially. The reproduction rate of a disease (R 0 ) represents the number of persons infected by each infected person. Liu et al. [20] reviewed studies which attempted to calculate the R 0 of COVID-19 in China, and observed that studies which used mathematical modeling reported an average R 0 of 4.2, while those that used statistical methods reported an average R 0 of 2.67. Both these values were observed to be higher than the WHO estimate of 1.95. Zhao et al. [21] used the Poisson process approach to estimate the R 0 for the Diamond Princess cruise ship at 2.1. Tindale et al. [22] statistically estimated R 0 for Singapore at 1.97 and Tianjin, China at 1.87. They also concluded that the mean incubation period for COVID-19 was significantly greater than the serial interval, raising the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Similar conclusions were also obtained by Mizumoto et al. [23] for the Diamond Princess cruise ship with an asymptomatic ratio of 17.9%, Nishiura et al. [24, 25] for Japan with an asymptomatic ratio of 41.6% and Zhao et al. [26] for Hong Kong. The Logistic Growth model and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model are among the most frequently used for epidemiological prediction, and have also been applied in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosa et al. [27] used a generalized logistic growth model to assess the impact of containment strategies in China and predict final case numbers. Vattay [28] implemented the logistic growth model to analyze the similarity between trends of death numbers in Hubei, China and Italy, and predicted an end date for further growth of COVID-19 in Italy. Wu et al. [29] analyzed the growth of COVID-19 in individual Chinese provinces using 4 logistic growth models, and further implemented them to predict case sizes in other countries of Europe, the Americas and Asia. Zhou et al. [30] forecasted the spread of COVID-19 using the logistic growth model and the basic SIER model, and observed that the pandemic size reported using the logistic model was considerably smaller. Batista [31] estimated the eventual size of COVID-19 cases worldwide using the logistic regression model as well as the SIR model, and observed negligible (<1%) difference among the forecasts of the two. Using observations from China and South Korea as benchmarks, Gaeta [32] analyzed the progression of COVID-19 in Italy using the SIR model and observed the initial growth rate in the countries to be similar in nature, drawing conclusions on the impact of future restrictive measures. Calafiore et al. [33] developed a modified SIR model for the forecast of COVID-19 numbers in individual Italian provinces, which contained an additional proportionality factor comparing the confirmed cases and the actual infected number. Ku et al. [34] utilized the modified Bass-SIR model to forecast the progression of the disease in Wuhan, predicting a second wave of cases if restrictions were lifted. Wangping et al. [35] employed an extended SIR model to estimate the basic reproduction number for Hunan, China and Italy, and forecast progression of COVID-19. They estimated R 0 to be 4.34 for Italy an 3.15 for Hunan, forecasting an endpoint for the disease.",

On an analysis of the results obtained, a number of deductions may be made from the trends yielded by both models. The most prominent observation deals with the region-specific nature of the propagation of the pandemic. The endpoints of the pandemic vary widely with region, with a cessation in cases being forecast for 30 July in Gujarat and 9 September in Delhi by the SIR model. The logistic model similarly forecasts wide variation in endpoints, from 23 June in Gujarat to 10 August in Delhi. A possible reason for this may be the restriction on inter-state travel implemented in India since 25 March 2020, which seem to have stemmed the propagation of the disease among states.

These values are also in concordance with reported values [40] . The Logistic Growth model forecasts lower case numbers as well as early endpoints for all the regions studied.

Using the logistic model, significant variations in the infection rate parameter r may be observed among states. The lowest infection rate of 0.07 is estimated for Delhi while the highest is estimated for Gujarat (0.12).

In the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra as well as for India as a whole, the progressively-eased lockdown totaling 53 days seems to have had a prominent impact, with the SIR model forecasting a peak in cases being reached inside the lockdown period for Gujarat and within 15 days of Lockdown 3 for India and Maharashtra. The logistic model forecasts that a peak in cases will be reached by Maharashtra and Gujarat as well as India within the lockdown period. Both the models indicate that the impact of the lockdown in Delhi has been nominal, with a peak being reached 15 to 30 days after Lockdown 3 as per existing trends.

That such a drop hasn't taken place yet indicates that stricter enforcement of social distancing guidelines is required throughout India. It is prudent to mention here that a significant majority of cases which the forecasts are based on, were detected during the lockdown period; an easing of the lockdown after 17 May is likely to lead to a spike in cases and a delay in the peak number of cases being reached. Especially for states such as Maharashtra and Delhi, where the peak is forecast to be reached after 17 May, it would be recommended that restrictions stay in place until a fall in cases is begun to be observed.",
