Traditionally, virus classification relied on properties such as virion morphology, genome organization, replication mechanism, serology, natural host range, mode of transmission, and pathogenicity. Yet viruses sharing the above properties can reveal tremendous differences at the genome level. For example, classification of many phages is currently based on presence, structure, and length of a tail, and this approach has been shown not to correlate with genomic information, leading to a very difficult situation and hundreds of unclassified phages.",

An alignment is an arrangement of residues of two or more sequences in a way that reveals their possible relatedness, with space characters inserted into the sequences to indicate single-residue insertions and deletions. A variety of algorithms and programs are available to suit a wide range of problems requiring sequence alignments as parts of their solutions. Depending on the specifics of a problem, different types of algorithms or their combinations may work best. Most alignment algorithms can be broadly categorized by the scope of their application on sequences (local vs. global), or by the number of sequences involved (pairwise vs. multiple).",

These operations are substitutions (called matches and mismatches in nucleotide alignments), insertions, and deletions. A generalization of this concept to multiple alignments is possible. Alignments are scored using a scoring scheme appropriate for a biological context. The widely used affine scheme assigns substitution scores to substitutions and a penalty to each space, and an additional penalty to each gap defined as a maximal consecutive run of spaces. Given a set of sequences, an alignment is called optimal if it has the maximal score over all possible alignments. Optimal alignments are not necessarily unique; two or more alignments can be tied with the same score.",

In this implementation, complete viral genomes are organized into groups corresponding to broad taxonomic entities such as family or floating genus. Within each group, alignments are pre-computed and stored in a database for each pair of the genomes. The alignments are used to evaluate identities, defined as the ratio of matching residues over the total alignment length. The alignments are computed using the pairwise global algorithm with the affine scoring scheme assigning one to matches and minus one to mismatches and nonterminal spaces and gaps. Since the genomes vary in lengths, terminal spaces are not penalized during the alignment computing but taken into account when computing the identity. PASC interface is built around a histogram of pairwise identities. The primary feature of the interface is the comparison of an external sequence such as a newly sequenced viral genome, with genomes in a user-selected group. After the sequence is submitted, PASC will start computing the alignments, or extracting them from the database if the query is a member of the group. At the end of the process, a user is presented with a list of closest matches. Matches can be selected to visualize their positions on the identity distribution chart.",

First of all, PASC is not suitable for virus families whose current classification is largely based on virus morphologies, such as phages in the families Siphoviridae and Podoviridae. The whole genome PASC may not work well for virus families with highly diverse sequences. This includes viruses with low overall sequence similarities or large differences in genome sizes and organization. For example, in the family Herpesviridae, the percentage of identity between different species in the genus Varicellovirus ranges from 39% (between cercopithecine herpesvirus 9 and suid herpesvirus 1) to 83% (between bovine herpesvirus 1 and bovine herpesvirus 5), while the percentage of identity between a virus in the genus Simplexvirus and one in the genus Varicellovirus could be as high as 54% (between cercopithecine herpesvirus 2 and bovine herpesvirus 5). The overlap of such identities makes it impossible to determine the species and genus demarcations for herpesviruses. In the family Poxviridae, the largest genome (canarypox virus) is almost 3 times as big as the smallest one (bovine papular stomatitis virus). The huge differences in the genomes sizes will introduce large artifacts when calculating the identities. In such cases, single gene or a cluster of genes needs to be used in PASC instead of whole genomes. The polymerase protein sequences of poxviruses have been used to perform PASC and a good result was obtained. However, not every single gene can be used for PASC.

The complete 158-amino-acid sequence of this protein was published in 1960. The first completely sequenced viral genome published was that of bacteriophage MS2 in 1976 (GenBank accession number V00642). Sanger used DNA from bacteriophage phiX174 ( J02482) in developing the dideoxy sequencing method, while the first animal viral genome, SV40 ( J02400), was sequenced using the Maxam and Gilbert method and published in 1978. Viruses therefore played a pivotal role in the development of modern-day sequencing methods, and viral sequence information (both protein and nucleotide) formed a substantial subset of the earliest available biological databases. In 1965, Margaret O. Dayhoff published the first publicly available database of biological sequence information. This Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure was available only in printed form and contained the sequences of approximately 50 proteins. Establishment of a database of nucleic acid sequences began in 1979 through the efforts of Walter Goad at the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and separately at the European Molecular Biology Laboratories (EMBL) in the early 1980s. In 1982, the LANL database received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was christened GenBank. In December of 1981, the Los Alamos Sequence Library contained 263 sequences of which 50 were from eukaryotic viruses and 12 were from bacteriophages. By its tenth release in 1983, GenBank contained 1865 sequences (1 827 214 nucleotides) of which 449 (457 721 nucleotides) were viral. In August of 2006, GenBank (release 154) contained approximately 59 000 000 records, including 367 000 viral sequences.",
