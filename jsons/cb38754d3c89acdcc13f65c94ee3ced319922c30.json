At this moment, fever, excessive nasal mucosa discharge (rhinorrhea), and muscle pain are predominant characteristics in COVID-19 (4, 10). Thus, evaluating these signs and symptoms before the practice of physical activity should be considered. It is important to note that the infected do not present any symptoms during the incubation period, and the incubation period can last for 5.5 days on average (11). However, the symptoms appear on average of 11.5 after the infection (11). Thus, these symptoms should be questioned daily. For this reason, as determined by the ACSM (2020), those who do not present signs and symptoms of the disease should be able continue to exercise regularly. COVID-19 spreads rapidly from human to human (12) . Some studies have demonstrated that each person infected transmits, on average, to four other persons (13) . For this reason, social distancing and isolation are required. Facing this new scenario of social isolation, exercise professionals have been using online technology to prescribe, and monitor exercise (14) , such as mobile telephones messages, apps, email, video calls, or other internet-based strategies (15) .",

Although non-specific symptom, it is one of the main symptoms of COVID-19, and, during the pandemic, it presents as a method with good sensitivity and ability to identify potentially contaminated people. As an example, a study of 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, documented that fever was present in 98.6% (136/138) of hospitalized patients. The other two patients who did not have fever were in intensive care unit beds, which may make us think of two situations: (a) they could have been medicated, which masks the result, and (b) the feverish state is not an indicator of the severity of the disease (19) .

For the purpose of doing it safely, the screening of COVID-19-related symptoms prior to exercise may help to identify those that are able to start exercising. Therefore, we have developed a tool to screen for the main COVID-19 symptoms to ensure the safety of exercise prescription. The Pre-Exercise Screening Questionnaire (PESQ) aims to quickly detect symptoms of COVID-19 to assess a person's readiness for physical exercise. This is prudent to avoid the potential risk of exacerbation of respiratory symptoms when starting exercise. The PESQ has seven questions that should be answered with a yes or no. Item 1 measures sore throat. Item 2 measures cough and sputum production. Item 3 measures fatigue. Item 4 measures shortness of breath or difficulty of breathing. Item 5 and 6 are related to fever, and Item 7 is related to any contact with anyone who has been diagnosed or suspected of the new coronavirus.",

Another disadvantage is that it is reliant on the interpretation of the individual's signs and symptoms without making available a professional assessment. Finally, the PESQ does not eliminate the need for medical clearance and/or exercise testing in many individuals; this is a simple screen tool for screening for relevant COVID-19 symptoms.",
