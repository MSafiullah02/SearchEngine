The retaliation by the world community against terrorism, which is an ongoing feature in world affairs, increased the airline passenger's fear and reluctance to use air transport. In most instances in commercial aircraft purchasing, air carriers cancelled or postponed their new aircraft requisition orders. Many carriers, particularly in developing countries, were seen revisiting their cost structures and downsizing their human resource bases. It is incontrovertible that another similar event or series of events will inevitably plunge the aviation industry into similar despair and destitution.",

The Conference concluded that the events of 11 September 2001 have had a major negative impact on world economies and an impact on air transport which is unparalleled in history and restoration of consumer confidence in air transport and assurance of the long-term health of the air transport industry are both vital, and many States have already initiated a range of measures to this effect. It was also the view of the Conference that the effective application of enhanced uniform security measures, commensurate with the threat, will help to restore confidence in air transport, but these measures will need to be passenger and cargo user-friendly and not overly costly for the industry and its consumers if traffic growth is to be regenerated. Accordingly, the Conference recommended that consistent with Assembly Resolution A33-1, States should intensify their efforts to achieve the full implementation and enforcement of the multilateral conventions on aviation security as well as of the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) relating to aviation security and take within their territories appropriate additional security measures which are commensurate with the level of threat and are cost effective. Since restoration of confidence in air transport is a collective responsibility, the Conference called upon States to enhance international cooperation in aviation security and assist developing countries to the extent possible.",

It was also considered useful to establish regional and sub-regional approaches which could make a significant contribution to ICAO's aviation security activities. The Conference concluded that aviation security was a responsibility of Contracting States, and States which outsource aviation security programmes should therefore ensure that adequate governmental control and supervision are in place. The Conference also observed that, since gaps and inadequacies appear to exist in international aviation security instruments with regard to new and emerging threats to civil aviation, further study was needed in this regard. There was a need for a comprehensive ICAO Aviation Security Plan of Action for strengthening aviation security, through a reinforced AVSEC mechanism, an ICAO aviation security audit programme, technical cooperation projects, promotion of aviation security quality control functions and appropriate performance indicators.",

It was the view of the Conference that the ability to determine whether an airport or State is in compliance will require that auditors have a solid aviation security background and be sufficiently trained and certified by ICAO to ensure that auditing is conducted in a consistent and objective manner. The Conference was strongly convinced that such an audit programme should be undertaken under the auspices of ICAO's AVSEC Mechanism which could be guided by proven and successful concepts used in viable programmes already developed by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), the United States and other States in the development of the framework for a security audit programme.",

It was recommended that all States be notified of a completed audit, that ICAO Headquarters be the repository for full audit reports and that the sharing of audit reports between States take place on a bilateral or multilateral basis. States were required, under such a programme, to commit to provide ICAO with national AVSEC findings based on a harmonized procedure to be developed by ICAO as early as possible. Of course, those States -in particular developing countries -should be provided with technical and financial assistance under technical cooperation, so that they may take remedial actions to rectify the deficiencies identified during the audit.

However, for the longer term a more stable means of funding the ICAO Aviation Security Plan of Action would be either through an increase of the assessment to the ICAO General Fund for the following triennia, or by a long-term commitment, on a voluntary basis, of systematic contributions according to an approved suggested level of contribution, to be determined by the Council, by all States. With regard to recouping policies of States, the Conference observed and confirmed that ICAO's policy and guidance material on cost recovery of security services at airports in ICAO's Policies on Charges for Airports and Air Navigation Services (Doc 9082/6) and the Airport Economics Manual (Doc 9562) remained valid, although there was a need for development of additional policy and guidance material on cost recovery of security measures with regard to air navigation services complementary to that which already exists with respect to airport security charges.

It was felt that one of the ways in which this could be achieved was by ICAO promoting the use of the ICAO Objectives Implementation Mechanism as a means for States to obtain technical cooperation, as required for the rectification of deficiencies identified during aviation security evaluations and audits and urgently pursuing the development and implementation of an International Financial Facility for Aviation Safety (IFFAS), 4 to encompass not only safety but also security. Another significant function of ICAO was to elaborate on its policy and guidance material on cost recovery of security services, notably to include development of policy and guidance material on cost recovery, through charges, of security measures with regard to air navigation services and explore the issue of using security charges as a means of recovering the cost of ICAO assistance when it is provided to States for security development projects.",

This statement recognizes that the right of self defence extends beyond an actual attack to an imminently threatened one, provided there is credible evidence of such a threat and the threatened State has no obviously alternative recourse available. Built into my question was the issue of collateral damage, or as we lawyers call it the law of unidentified consequences. A case in point is the 2002 targeted killing of a military wing leader of Hamas who was known to be planning and ordering numerous successful bombings against civilians. He was also known to have been planning attacks that were unprecedented in size and consequences. In the process, he was using young children as human shields to carry out suicide attacks against Israel. The Israelis believed that killing the Hamas military leader would thwart the planned attacks and save hundreds of innocent lives. The difficulty in killing this terrorist was that he was constantly changing his living quarters. Often his wife slept beside him, exposing herself, an \"uninvolved\" person, to the possibility of being killed in an attack against the terrorist. The decision was therefore taken to order a hit only when the terrorist was alone. In one instance, a strike was called off when it was discovered he was with family members. However, when the strike was eventually carried out, the rocket killed not only the terrorist but also his wife, 14-year-old daughter and several others. Israel later issued a statement saying that if they had known the strike action would have resulted in collateral damage the attack would never have taken place.",

How would you weigh the one innocent life against hundreds of others?\" Alan Dershowitz, Professor at Harvard Law School and leading criminal lawyer and constitutional scholar, asks the question differently. In the context of the Holocaust of the Second World War, Dershowitz asks: \"what if the Jewish Underground had credibly believed that by blowing up German Kindergartens in Berlin, they could force the closure of death camps -that the killing of a hundred innocent German children could save the lives of one million innocent Jewish children and adults, would this be a morally permissible choice of evils?\" 14 It will not be difficult to surmise that most people, in considering this dilemma, will agree that the wilful killing of innocent people crosses a certain moral line that should be crossed, if ever, in the most extreme and compelling circumstances.",

Another observation was that increasing certainty of punishment decreased the incidence of homicide, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. It was also found that certainty appeared to have an independent effect separate from severity of punishment.

The underlying concept of the deterrence theory supports the hypothesis that rationalists consider potential criminals as rational decision-makers faced with constraints and uncertainty in their decision making process. The explanation of governmental actions follows the same pattern of the rational model. Therefore, an analyst could conclude that criminals and governmental officials are engaged in a \"game\" where criminals try to maximize their illegitimate goals through the \"least expensive\" (apprehension and punishment) approaches and governmental policy makers try to prevent crimes by increasing the probability of apprehension and creating a punishment measure which will serve as a deterrent.",

Negotiation with the terrorist in particular has to be done by professionals specially trained for the task. A fortiori, the media has to be handled by specialists with experience.

The greatest problem of deterrence is the pusillanimity of the international community in the face of terrorism and the feeble response offered by States as a composite body. The reasons for this hesitation on the part of the international community to adopt effective measures against international terrorism is by no means inexplicable.

This is particularly so in civil aviation where weapons of mass destruction accounted for 1,993 lives in the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001 and the threat of a similar repeat offence has not entirely disappeared. Against this backdrop, the three grave and emerging threats to civil aviation are bioterrorism, cyber-terrorism and the misuse of shoulder launched surface to air missiles. 15 At its 33rd session held in Montreal from 25 September -5 October 2001, the ICAO 16 Assembly adopted Resolution A33-1 17 which was a direct response to the terrorist acts of 9/11. The Resolution recognized that a new type of threat was posed to civil aviation which required new concerted efforts and policies of cooperation on the part of States. The Resolution also urges all ICAO member States to ensure, in accordance with Article 4 of the Chicago Convention, 18 that civil aviation is not used for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of the Convention, and to hold accountable and punish severely those who misuse civil aircraft as weapons of destruction, including those responsible for planning and organizing such acts or for aiding, supporting or harbouring perpetrators. It also called upon States to cooperate with each other in this endeavour and to ensure that ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) relating to aviation security are adhered to. 15 There is also a new dimension in the sabotage of aviation which results in damage caused by the hostile use of dirty bombs, electromagnetic pulse devices or biochemical materials. Dirty bombs are devices which cause damage through nuclear detonation involving the spread of radioactivity to undetermined areas. This article will not address this threat. However, for a detailed discussion on this threat see Abeyratne (2005, pp. 117-129) . 16 The International Civil Aviation Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was established by Article 44 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), signed at Chicago on 7 December 1944 (ICAO Doc 7300/9, Ninth Edition, 2006). The main objectives of ICAO are to develop the principles and techniques of international air navigation and to foster the planning and development of air transport. ICAO has 190 Contracting States. ICAO's Mission and Vision Statement is \"to achieve its mission of safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation through cooperation amongst its member States\". In December 2004, following a decision by the 35th Session of the ICAO Assembly, the Council of ICAO approved six Strategic Objectives for 2005-2010: They are: safety; security; environmental protection; efficiency; continuity; and rule of law. The Strategic Objective applicable to this article is security. Finally the Resolution directed the Council of ICAO and the Secretary General to act urgently to address new and emerging threats to civil aviation, in particular to review the adequacy of existing aviation conventions on security.",

In this paper, Australia quoted the Preamble 21 to the Chicago Convention and emphasized that ICAO was created to help ensure the safe and orderly growth of civil aviation and to encourage the operation of civil aircraft for peaceful purposes. It was also the view of Australia that there were gaps in the international legal framework with regard to the unlawful transport of biological, chemical and legal weapons and other dangerous material on board civil aircraft and that the international aviation community had a responsibility to address these lacunae and shortcomings, particularly when an opportunity such as the one presented through the ICAO meeting arose.",

It also states that it is desirable to avoid friction and to promote co-operation between nations and peoples upon which the peace of the world depends. In pursuance of these objectives, governments signed the Convention that contains certain principles and arrangements in order that international civil aviation may be developed in a safe and orderly manner and that international air transport services may be established on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically. infectious substances 24 and patient specimens by all modes of transport, both nationally and internationally, and include the changes that apply from 1 January 2005. 25 The WHO regulations categorically state that The Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air published by ICAO are the legally binding international regulations. 26 IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) that incorporate the ICAO provisions and may add further restrictions (where necessary such restrictions are included in these guidelines). The ICAO rules apply on all international flights. For national flights, i.e. flights within one country, national civil aviation authorities apply national legislation. This is normally based on the ICAO provisions, but may incorporate variations. State and operator variations are published in the ICAO Technical Instructions and in the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. The WHO guidelines also contain detailed packing instructions regarding infectious substances. 27 A Special Sub Committee of the Legal Committee of ICAO met in Montreal from 3 to 6 July 2007 to discuss the preparation of one or more instruments addressing new and emerging threats. One of the issues addressed at this meeting was the unlawful transport of biological, chemical, nuclear weapons and other dangerous substances on board aircraft.",

Pathogens are defined as microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) and other agents such as prions, which can cause disease in humans or animals. The definition is applied to all specimens except those explicitly excluded in the WHO Guidance Material. 25 The international regulations for the transport of infectious substances by any mode of transport are based upon the Recommendations made by the Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UNCETDG), a committee of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The Recommendations are presented in the form of Model Regulations. The United Nations Model Regulations are reflected in international law through international modal agreements. 26 Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air: Supplement 2009/10 Edition (Doc 9284). 27 The system of packaging is recommended for use all infectious substances. It consists of three layers as follows: Primary receptacle -which is a primary watertight, leak-proof receptacle containing the specimen. The receptacle is packaged with enough absorbent material to absorb all fluid in case of breakage. Secondary packaging -which is a second durable, watertight, leakproof packaging to enclose and protect the primary receptacle(s). Several cushioned primary receptacles may be placed in one secondary packaging, but sufficient additional absorbent material shall be used to absorb all fluid in case of breakage. Outer packaging -which are secondary packagings placed in outer shipping packagings with suitable cushioning material. Outer packagings protect their contents from outside influences, such as physical damage, while in transit. The smallest overall external dimension shall be 10 cm \u00c2 10 cm. Each completed package is normally required to be marked, labelled and accompanied with appropriate shipping documents (as applicable).

On another aviation platform, Giovanni Bisignani, Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) stressed at its Annual General Meeting held in Vancouver from 3 to 5 June 2007 that the industry has changed tremendously in five years since 9/11. Bisignani stated that, six years after the tragic events of 2001, air travel was much more secure but there were unlimited ways to attack the aircraft integrity. He added that there was no perfect security system and terrorists change tactics and weapons. Bisignani rightly pointed out that terrorists are studying what measures the industry is adopting; and that all the air industry can do is make the system strong enough to constitute sufficient deterrent and make aircraft a harder target to hit.",

It was suggested that States adopt an approach providing for a baseline regime, but with the addition of unpredictable measures, thus achieving a balance between certainty and unpredictability. With regard to an amendment to Annex 17 in this regard, the need for introducing unpredictability into the aviation security regime was considered, and it was agreed that unpredictability should be promoted in principle but not prescribed. The Panel suggested that if an Annex 17 specification related to unpredictability were to be developed, it would be necessary to ensure that the introduction of this concept by States does not diminish the level of security or result in delays for passengers. Further, the Panel noted that appropriate guidance material may be required to address the potential negative impact of introducing the concept of unpredictability, and proposed the development of guidance material related to unpredictability prior to the introduction of an amendment to Annex 17.",

            "text": "The recent recreation of the Spanish flu virus that killed 50 million people worldwide in 1918 proves that deadly viruses are being revisited and are undergoing genetic modification. This brings to bear the inevitable question as to whether there is enough security to stop them from falling into the wrong hands. There is also the ominous prospect -that transportation of these dangerous pathogens by air would leave aviation vulnerable. This article examines precautionary measures currently being taken and the legal and regulatory significance of such measures. The leakage of dangerous pathogens 30 from laboratories presents an ominous analogy to the aviation sector in that the same could well occur in the carriage of such dangerous goods by air. Although past instances of escaping dangerous pathogens are small in number, nonetheless their occurrence and the threat posed to the wellbeing of humanity cannot be underestimated. In 2002 when Anthrax spores escaped from two military laboratories in the United States, the authorities agreed that the leakage was due to a security lapse. 31 In 2003 a string of such leakages occurred in Asia, this time of the SARS virus. 32 It is now known that the laboratory is not the only place where security lapses could occur. Modern exigencies require samples of deadly pathogens to be transported regularly over vast distances to reach researchers across the world. This calls for a delicate balance between recognizing the compelling need for scientists to exchange and collectively use different strains in order to identify naturally occurring diseases and mutations on the one hand and ensuring that the transport of these infectious substances 33 are carried out according to United Nations Model Regulations 34 on the other. These model regulations are the base upon which specific 30 Pathogens are micro-organisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) or recombinant micro-organisms (hybrid or mutant) that are known or are reasonably expected to cause infectious disease in humans or animals. 31 An year earlier, a covert event occurred in October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent through the mail exposing persons in the eastern USA to contaminated mail resulting in deaths, illnesses and identified exposures to Anthrax. Overt, announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred, have taken place in the United States, although most of these were determined to have been hoaxes, that is, there were no true exposures to infectious agents. 32 The leakages occurred in China, Taiwan and Singapore. See Air-Tight Security, Intersec, June 2007, 33-35 at 34. 33 Infectious substances are defined as substances known to contain, or reasonably expected to contain, pathogens. 34 The United Nations has developed recommendations on model regulations for the transport of dangerous goods which recognize that various chemical combinations and mixtures have different requirements in packing for the purpose of transport. See Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations, Volume 1, 14th Revised Edition: 2005, Chap. 2.6, p. 113-114. Furthermore, the United Nations Model regulations contain packing instructions for primary, secondary and outer packaging of hazardous goods. See Model Regulations Id. Volume 11, Instruction P620 at p. 70. Specimens (human, animal, food, environmental, etc.) known or reasonably expected to contain pathogens are now to be classified as infectious substances. When provisions for the carriage by air are formulated in the packing of samples of infectious pathogens for transportation by air. The shipment of infectious agents or diagnostic specimens by air must comply with local, national and international regulations. International air transport regulations are contained in various documentation of the International Civil Aviation Organization and Dangerous Goods Regulations -an annual publication of the International Air Transport Association published in January, and usually revised on a yearly basis. These ICAO and IATA documents will be discussed in some detail later in this article.",

See generally, Abeyratne (2002, pp. 53-80) . 36 Rapid response to a dangerous pathogen event requires prompt identification of its onset. Because of the rapid progression to illness and potential for dissemination of some of these agents, it may not be practical to await diagnostic laboratory confirmation. Instead, it is necessary to initiate a response based on the recognition of high-risk syndromes, i.e., typical combination of clinical features of the illness at presentation that might alert healthcare practitioners to the possibility of an outbreak. Examples of syndromes potentially resulting from infections with dangerous pathogens include: encephalitis/meningitis, hemorrhagic mediastinitis, severe pneumonia, papulopustular rash, hemorrhagic fever, descending paralysis and nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea. 37 An outbreak is usually identified consequent to a rapidly increasing disease incidence (e.g., within hours or days) in a normally healthy population, such as unexplained death with fever in a non-trauma patient, or a botulism-like syndrome, meningitis or encephalitis in more than one patient.",

These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. While some bioterrorism agents, such as the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person some agents such as anthrax are incapable of doing so.",

Until recently in the United States of America, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than looking after ordinary people in cities. In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the co director of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \"non-traditional\" (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nation-wide.",

The attack caused about 751 people to get sick (there were no fatalities). This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the twentieth century. In September and October of 2001, several cases of anthrax broke out in the United States which were reportedly caused deliberately. This was a well-publicized act of bioterrorism. It motivated efforts to define biodefense and biosecurity. 39 In 1915 and 1916, Dr Anton Dilger, a German-American physician used cultures of anthrax and glanders with the intention of committing biological sabotage on behalf of the German government. Other German agents are known to have undertaken similar sabotage efforts during World War I in Norway, Spain, Romania and Argentina.",

Researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by ranching and feedlot operations, food processors, drinking water systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.

The threat of MANPADS to aviation security is by far the most ominous and the international aviation community has made some efforts through ICAO. In recent years, Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) have posed a serious threat to aviation security. MANPADS are extremely effective weapons which are prolific in their availability worldwide. Introduced in the 1950s and originally meant to deter terror attacks from air to ground to be used by State authorities and other protection agencies, these weapons have got into the wrong hands and are being used against civil and military aviation. The surface to air MANPAD is a light weapon which offers very little warning before impact, and is often destructive and lethal. 45 They are cheap, easily carried, handled and concealed. It is claimed that there are at least 100,000 and possibly in excess of 500,000 systems in inventories around the world and several thousands of these are vulnerable to theft from State authorities. 46 It is also claimed that there is a 70% chance that a civil aircraft will be destroyed if hit by a MANPAD. 47 A study conducted and published in early 2005 by the Rand Corporation concludes that, based on the effects of the attacks of 11 September 2001, it is plausible for air travel in the United States to fall by 15-20% after a successful MANPADS attack on a commercial airliner in the United States. 48 The international aviation community is aware that civil aircraft are particularly vulnerable to hand held ground to air missiles and that susceptibility avoidance techniques (calculated to avoid being hit) and vulnerability avoidance (survival after being hit) systems must be in place. This is particularly so since tracking the proliferation of MANPADS is difficult since any intelligence gathered on this particular threat is usually ex post facto, through the recovery of launchers or fragments from expended missiles. Contrary to popular belief, the MANPAD is considerably durable and can be used several years after inactivity, with recharged batteries.",

Over the past 35 years, significant developments have taken place in dangerous weapons systems creating more opportunities for terrorists. The ready acceptance of new modern technologies by the international community and our growing dependence on them have created many targets, such as nuclear and civil aircraft in flight. Similarly, developments in electronics and microelectronics, and the trend towards miniaturization and simplification have resulted in a greater availability of tactical weapons with longer ranges and more accuracy that are also simpler to operate. One of the most effective developments in individual weaponry is portable, precision-guided munitions (PGMs), which are lightweight and easy to operate. They can usually be carried and operated by a single person. The United States-made Stinger, the British-made Blowpipe and the Russian-made SA-7 missiles are examples of these smaller weapons. These are shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missiles that have infra-red, heatseeking sensors in the projectile that guide it to the heat emitted from an aircraft engine. It is known that more than 60 States possess SA-7 missiles and there is no 45 The lethality of the weapon can be reflected by the 340 MANPADS used by Afghan Mujahedeen rebels to successfully hit 269 soviet aircraft.

Although modern technologies clearly aid terrorists in terms of weapons and targets, technology can also be used against terrorists. Governments which are endowed with the necessary technology can keep track of terrorist organizations and their movements with the aid of computers. At the same time, electronic collection methods and signals intelligence afford the possibility of eavesdropping on and intercepting terrorist communications, leading to better predictions of their operations. One of the instances where intelligence gathering has worked well to prevent terrorism occurred in September 1984, when the Provisional IRA spent an estimated \u00a31.5 million in the United States on a massive shipment of seven tons of arms. With the help of an informer about a forthcoming shipment of weapons, including rockets, to the Provisional IRA from the United States, the FBI informed British intelligence, who in turn contacted the Irish, and the ship carrying the arms was tracked by a US satellite orbiting 300 km above the earth. The satellite photographed the transfer of the arms to a trawler. Finally, two Irish Navy vessels intercepted the trawler and British security forces arrested the crew. 51 This incident shows that intelligence gathering with the help of high technology can cut off the transfer of missiles and other weapons to terrorists.",

One good example is the measure taken by the British government which, immediately after the discovery of 20 SA-7s in the coaster Eksund, which was intercepted by French authorities off the coast of Brittany in November 1987 when bound for the IRA, fitted all British Army helicopters flying in Northern Ireland with electronic and other decoy systems to confuse the missile's heat-seeking guidance system. These included the US-made Saunders, AN/ALG 144. This system, when linked to the Tracor AN/ALE 40 chaff dispenser, works by jamming the missile's homing radar and sending infra-red flares and chaff to act as a decoy for the heat-seeking device. 52 The system is used by both the US and the Israeli Armies, which have been well-pleased with its performance. Until the British realised that the IRA might be in possession of SAMs, the Ministry of Defense hesitated to install such a system because of the high cost involved, and its decision to do so shows the seriousness of the threat. Another example of a good counter-measure is the response of El Al airlines to the threat of such an attack which included the installation of electronic countermeasure equipment similar to that employed on military aircraft to divert surface-to-air missiles. 53 However the problem is that 51 The Daily Telegraph, 16 October 1984; The Times, 12 December 1984. 52 The Daily Telegraph, 7 January 1988. 53 Lewis and Kaplan (1990, p. 226); Crenshaw (1987, p. 126 ). these countermeasures are not yet fully effective, although they could minimize the threat. Hence there is a need to proceed diligently with the development of systems that are guaranteed to be able to prevent this type of attack against civil aviation.",

            "text": "The use of SAMs and anti-tank rockets by terrorists goes back to 1973. On 5 September 1973 Italian police arrested five Middle-Eastern terrorists armed with SA-7s. The terrorists had rented an apartment under the flight path to Rome Fumicino Airport and were planning to shoot down an El Al airliner coming in to land at the airport. 56 This arrest proved a considerable embarrassment to Egypt because the SA-7s were later traced back to a batch supplied to it by the Russian Union. It was alleged that the Egyptian government was supplying some of the missiles to the Libyan army but inexplicably, the SA-7s had been directly rerouted to the terrorists. This incident also placed the Russian Union in an awkward position 54 Dorey (1983, p. 142) . 55 Stewart (1993, p. 12) . 56 Dobson and Payne (1987, p. 366). because of the possibility that its new missile and its policy of the proxy use of surrogate warfare against democratic states were revealed to the West. 57 The plot of the missile attack on El Al derived from an appalling incident on 21 February 1973, when a Libyan B-727 was shot down over the Sinai desert by an Israeli fighter, killing the 108 innocent people on-board. 58 The Libyan people called for vengeance against Israel. Libya urged the other Arab States to send their warplanes against Israel's major cities and to destroy Israeli airliners wherever they could be found. 59 On 5 January 1974, 220 soldiers and 200 police sealed off five square miles around Heathrow International airport in London after receiving reports that terrorists had smuggled SA-7s into Britain in the diplomatic pouches of Middle-Eastern embassies and were planning to shoot down an El Al airliner. 60 Another significant incident occurred on 13 January 1975 when an attempt by terrorists to shoot down an El Al plane with a missile was believed to have brought civil aviation to the brink of disaster. Two terrorists drove their car onto the apron at Orly airport, where they set up a rocket launcher and fired at an El Al airliner which was about to take off for New York with 136 passengers. The first round missed the target thanks to the pilot's evasive action and hit the fuselage of a Yugoslav DC-9 aeroplane waiting nearby to embark passengers for Zagreb. The rocket failed to explode and no serious casualties were reported. After firing again and hitting an administration building, which caused some damage, the terrorists escaped by car. A phone call from an individual claiming responsibility for the attack was received at Reuters. The caller clearly implied that there would be another such operation, saying 'Next time we will hit the target'.",

The French authorities traced the attack to the PFLP Venezuelan terrorist, and leader of the PFLP group in Europe, Carlos. 61 It is also known that once again an El Al airliner had been deliberately chosen as a target by Gadafi in an attempt to avenge the loss of the Libyan airliner shot down by Israel over the Sinai Desert. 62 Despite there failures, on 25 January 1976 another abortive attempt was carried out by three PFLP terrorists, who were arrested by Kenyan police at Nairobi Airport -following a tip-off by Israeli intelligence to the Kenyan General Service Unit -before they had time to fire SA-7 missiles at an El Al aircraft carrying 100 passengers. In connection with this operation, two members of the German Baader-Meinhoff Faction, Thomas Reuter and Brigitte Schultz, were also arrested. After 10 days of interrogation, the terrorists were handed over to Israel by the Kenyan 57 Dobson and Payne (1977, p. 134 Mickolus (1980, p. 428) . 61 Dobson and Payne (1977, p. 53) . 62 Dobson and Payne (1977, p. 53). government. However, it was not until March 1977, 14 months after the arrests in Kenya, that the Israelis officially announced that they were holding the three Palestinian and two German terrorists. During this period an unsuccessful attempt to gain their release was undertaken by the PFLP in June 1976, when Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air France aircraft to Entebbe. The names of the five being held in Israel were included on the list of prisoners whose release was demanded in exchange for the hostages. The three Palestinians were released by the Israeli government in 1985. 63 There has been a marked increase in missile attacks since 1984. On 21 September 1984 Afghan counter-revolutionaries fired a surface-to-air missile and hit a DC-10 Ariana Airliner carrying 308 passengers. The explosion tore through the aircraft's left engine, damaging its hydraulic system and a wing containing a fuel tank. The captain of the aircraft, however, managed to land the aircraft safely at Kabul International Airport. 64 Another significant incident took place on 4 April 1985, when a member of Abu Nidal group fired an RPG rocket at an Alia airliner as it took off from Athens Airport. Although the rocket did not explode, it left a hole in the fuselage. 65 Advanced missiles and rockets can be found in many terrorist and insurgent armouries. It is suspected that some terrorist organizations, including Iranian militia in Lebanon, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and various African and Latin American insurgents, possess the sophisticated Russian-made RPG-7 portable rocket launcher, but it is disturbing to note that some terrorist organizations, most notably Palestinian groups, have their own RPG-7-manufacturing facilities. In addition, more than a dozen other terrorist and insurgent groups are known to possess portable surface-to-air missiles, These groups include various Cuban surrogates, Colombian drug dealers, and a number of African, European and Palestinian terrorist organizations. 66 The possibility of undeterred use of missiles may be encouraged by the rapid proliferation of such weaponry and the publicity to be gained by using such systems. The enhanced effectiveness of missiles against aircraft makes the threat of such attacks real.",

As some targets are becoming more difficult for terrorists to attack it can be anticipated that they will make efforts to overcome the enhanced security systems as well as redirecting their efforts towards less secure targets. The displacement of the increasingly ineffective system of hijacking by missile attacks against civil aviation is a real threat.",

The Wassenaar Arrangement complements and reinforces, without duplication, the existing control regimes for weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, as well as other internationally recognized measures designed to promote transparency and greater responsibility, by focusing on the threats to international and regional peace and security which may arise from transfers of armaments and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies where the risks are judged greatest. It is also calculated to enhance co-operation in order to prevent the acquisition of armaments and sensitive dual-use items for military end-uses, if the situation in a region or the conduct of a state is, or becomes, a cause for serious concern to the Participating States. It is not the intent and purpose of the Arrangement to be directed against any state or group of states, nor will it impede bona fide civil transactions. Furthermore it will not interfere with the rights of states to acquire legitimate means with which to defend themselves pursuant to Article 51 70 of the Charter of the United Nations. 71 The Arrangement allows for Participating States to control all items set forth in a list of dual-use goods and technologies and in the munitions list, with the objective of preventing unauthorized transfers or retransfers of those items. Participating States also agree to exchange general information on risks associated with transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies in order to consider, where necessary, the scope for co-ordinating national control policies to combat the risks involved. At the tenth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement, held in Vienna on 8-9 December 2004, participating States reaffirmed their intent and resolve to prevent the acquisition by unauthorized persons of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, in particular by terrorist groups and Organizations. States also exchanged information on various national measures adopted to implement the provisions of the Arrangement.",

It has not been designated the conventional term \"convention\" or \"agreement\" but nonetheless carries the agreement of participating States to collaborate in complementing, without duplication existing regimes on the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. The Wassenaar Arrangement is not a treaty in the sense of Article 102 of the United Nations Charter, 72 nor is it a treaty as defined by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, Article 2 of which defines a treaty inter alia as an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law. However, it remains an agreement between sovereign States concerning the implementation of municipal law of each participating State. This does not, however, mean that the Wassenaar Arrangement cannot be considered an international agreement or that it is invalid. It merely means that the Arrangement does not come within the purview of the Vienna Convention. It is worthy of note that Article 3 of the Convention explicitly recognizes that international agreements between States do not lose their validity merely because they do not come within the ambit of the Convention. 73 As mentioned earlier, the Assembly of ICAO, 74 at its 36th Session (Montreal, 18-28 September 2007), adopted Resolution A36-2, wherein the Assembly 71 Article 51 of the United Nations Charter provides, inter alia, that nothing in the Charter will impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. 72 Infrastructure Safety and the Environment Article 102 of the UN Charter stipulates that every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any member of the United Nations after the Charter comes into force shall be registered with the UN Secretariat as soon as possible. 73 Shaw (2003, p. 812) . 74 The ICAO triennial Assembly, where its 190 member States gather to evaluate policy and make new policy as necessary through its Resolutions, is the supreme governing body of the Organization. expressed its deep concern regarding the global threat posed to civil aviation by terrorist acts, in particular the threat posed by MANPADS, other surface-to-air missiles systems, light weapons and rocket propelled grenades.",

All Contracting States were urged to apply the principles defined in the Elements for Export Controls of MANPADS of the Wassenaar Arrangement.

As international civil aviation industry attaches great importance to the security screening of liquids, many countries have made a lot of efforts on the study of liquids detect methods. At present and in the near future, the most effective and safest security way is combination of regular measures, such as X-ray screening, visual examination, inspection by removing the bottle lids, restriction on carrying liquids, etc. ICAO temporary security control guidelines provide a uniform operation mode of liquids screening, which is helpful to the unification of international civil aviation security standard.",
