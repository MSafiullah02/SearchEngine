The definition of an unconfirmed probable H7N9 case is a patient with epidemiologic evidence of contact with poultry or wild bird(s) and clinical manifestations of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, or severe pneumonia excluding infection with seasonal influenza virus (H1N1, H5N1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The confirmed cases also met at least 1 of the laboratory criteria for confirmatory diagnosis: (1) positive for H7N9 virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; (2) isolation virus from respiratory sample; or (3) a \u22654-fold rise in antibody titers against H7N9 virus.",

Age of cases ranged from 4 years to 87 years (median, 59 years). Occupation of cases mainly included retired persons (52.5%), farmers (11.9%), chefs and slaughterers who were directly exposed to poultry (10.2%), and housing workers (8.5%). The median number of days between illness onset to diagnosis was 10 days (range, 1\u201340 days) and most patients (86.4%) were confirmed within 2 weeks of illness onset. The human cases were distributed sporadically over 40 counties in eastern China, including Shanghai Municipality (40.7%), Jiangsu Province (27.1%), Zhejiang Province (23.7%), Anhui Province (3.4%), Henan Province (3.4%), and Beijing Municipality (1.7%).",

The median number of days between illness onset to death was 12 days (range, 4\u201325 days). Nationwide, the 13 deaths were sporadically distributed over 12 counties of Shanghai Municipality (n = 8), Jiangsu Province (n = 3), Zhejiang Province (n = 1), and Anhui Province (n = 1). The initial diagnoses for all confirmed H7N9 cases were (1) pneumonia of unknown cause (n = 12), (2) other infectious disease (n = 12), and (3) unconfirmed probable H7N9 cases (n = 35). Mortality of cases with a diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause or other infectious disease was higher than that of unconfirmed probable cases of H7N9 (6/12 or 5/12 vs 2/35, respectively; P < .01, Fisher exact test).",
