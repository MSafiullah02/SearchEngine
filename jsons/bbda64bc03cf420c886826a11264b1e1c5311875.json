Abstract Background: With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, its effect on society is amplified. We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. Results: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2% were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N=301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N=216).

The median period between onset of symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result was 16 days (IQR, 10-23). (Figure 1A) Positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was detected soon after the onset of symptoms, with a gradually decreasing trend thereafter. We showed that after 4 weeks (>28 days), 26.3% samples are still positive for SARS-CoV-2. (Figure 1B) The above findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 viral replication has a relatively long period in infected patients compared to SARS-CoV. 14 Although viral replication is not necessarily associated with severity of immunopathological damage, it implied that, to limit transmission of the disease, infected patients need exclusive monitoring until at least two consecutive negative RT-PCR results are obtained. It should be noted that one patient had a positive result of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay on day 42 after the onset of symptoms. This, currently, is the longest period had been reported. The impact of demographic factors on dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 has not been studied before. The previous studies suggested that coronavirus is more likely to infect older individuals with weaker immune functions. 3-4, 15 We collected the test results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and performed the subgroup analysis by age. Older patients (\u226565 years) had a significant longer time interval (18 days) of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result than patients <65 years (14 days). (Figure 2A) One possible explanation is that the dysfunction of immune system in older patients resulted J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in a prolonged elimination of the virus.
