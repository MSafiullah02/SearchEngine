Although it is uncertain when the next pandemic influenza will happen, even seasonal influenza poses a major challenge to hospitals. So it is essential to understand and determine the prognosis of patients with seasonal influenza who require respiratory support and ICU admission. The need for mechanical ventilation2 and severity of illness3 had previously been identified as poor prognostic factors of influenza. However, specific prognostic features including presence of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bacterial superinfection and the effects of vaccination status have not been systematically studied.",
