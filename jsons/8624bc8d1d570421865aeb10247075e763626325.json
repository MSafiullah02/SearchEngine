From the perspectives of investment and portfolio management, the banking sector is important to investors because of the close relationship among banks from the same country and across regions of the world, which could lead to contagion risk and to a reduction in diversification potential. Investors are often interested in knowing how banks interdepend (spillover) on one another and in the extent to which they affect and are affected by the performance of the financial sector. Hence, understanding the network structure of interdependence among banks and the financial sector is crucial to portfolio investors and risk managers, as this can help them design investment strategies that will reduce dependence risk and increase diversification. Investors are also often interested in identifying the banks that contribute the most (least) risk to their investment positions so that they are considered with caution in their investable portfolios, particularly during times of financial turmoil.",

The total connectedness of the emerging market banks is more intensified than that of the banks from developed America due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The portfolio optimization shows that in developed America, the largest banks from the USA are the largest risk contributors to total portfolio risk, whereas the banks from Canada contribute the least risk. In emerging America, the banks from Brazil contribute the most risk to total portfolio risk while the banks from Peru and one bank from Colombia contribute the least risk.

            "text": "The first view highlights the domino effects of networks and states that highly interconnected banking and financial networks can serve as a shock amplifier. Many studies argue that interbank networks may fail to allocate liquidity efficiently due to frictions, such as asymmetric information on bank assets (Flannery, 1996; Freixas and Jorge, 2008) , bank freeriding on other banks' liquidity and imperfect risk-sharing (Bryant, 1980; Bhattacharya and Gale, 1987) , bank free-riding on the central bank's liquidity due to selecting an insufficient liquidity buffer (Repullo, 2005) , and frictions brought about by market power (Donaldson, 1992; Acharya et al., 2012) . Among others, Dasgupta (2004) argues that contagion may occur with positive probability in a banking system as a result of balance sheet connections across institutions. Diamond and Rajan (2005) examined how the liquidity shortages and solvency problems of banks interact and how each can cause the other. Nier et al. (2007) analysed how the structure of the financial system affects systemic risk. Caballero and Simsek (2009) proposed a model for capturing what appears to be a central feature of financial panic. Gai and Kapadia (2010) explored how the probability and potential impacts of contagion are influenced by aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, changes in network structure, and asset market liquidity. Blume et al. (2013) modelled interbank contagion as an epidemic. Zawadowski (2013) proposed a model of an entangled financial system in which banks hedge their portfolio risk using over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. The author argues that inefficiency arises when banks shift risk through the network externalities created by OTC contracts. Elliott et al. (2014) studied cascades of failures occurring in financial networks using a model with equity share cross-ownership. Cabrales et al. (2017) investigated how the capacity of an economic system to absorb shocks depends on the specific patterns of interconnections established among financial firms.",

These authors showed that incomplete network structures are more prone to contagion than complete network structures and that more densely interconnected networks are more resilient because the proportion of losses in one bank's portfolio is divided among several creditors, reducing the impact of negative shocks from an individual bank on other banks within the network. Freixas et al. (2000) argue that more interbank connections enhance the resilience of a system to the insolvency of a particular bank.

Silva et al. (2018) simulated shocks to the real sector and evaluated how the financial system reacts to and amplifies these events using Brazilian loan-level data. Mart\u00ednez-Jaramillo et al. (2014) examined topological properties of interbank exposure and payments system networks to measure and monitor systemic risk in the Mexican banking system. Poledna et al.

However, bank networks are defined in our study based on economic connections identified from stock market price data (i.e., correlation networks of stock returns) as in Billio et al. (2012), Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) , Brunetti et al. (2015) and Candelon et al. (2018) . The latter view is generally accepted in the literature as strong correlations in the bank equity sector are the main source of systemic risk among financial institutions, and interconnectedness is driven by common features of the portfolio asset holdings of banks and mutual funds. 1 On the sectoral level Balli et al. (2013a) following Bekaert and Harvey (1997) , Ng (2000) , and Bekaert et al. (2005) , and by focusing on the return, volatility and trend spillover effects of global and local shocks, investigated the spillovers among Euro-wide sector indices and how integrated sector equity indices from the Euro area and USA are. With respect to spillovers among Euro-wide sectors they find that once the Euro was introduced global shock derived spillovers declined. In the same line they also find that the aggregate Euro index affects in different degrees the sectoral equity indices, most noticeably those from the financial services industry. In relation to integration among Euro and USA sector equity indices they find that when the trend is considered in the analysis of volatility spillovers some sector equity indices from both regions of the world have a similar response to global and local shocks, and that integration across equity sectors is not uniform. Balli et al. (2013b) also using the spillover models proposed by Bekaert and Harvey (1997) , Ng (2000) , and Bekaert et al. (2005) studied how global and local shocks impacted the sector equity returns from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.",

These shocks have a weaker impact on utility, telecom and basic material sectors, compared to other sectors, and there has been a reduction in the effect global shocks have on GCC sector returns. Lastly, they also find that national GCC equity market portfolios perform less better than portfolios diversified across GCC-wide sectors. Balli et al. (2014) by means of univariate AR-GARCH and trend spillover models analyse the impact of global and local shocks on the sector and national returns of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). They also analyse the resource allocation characteristics of ASEAN-wide sector and national portfolios using mean-variance portfolio optimization. Their findings indicate a sector dependent effect from market shocks, with local shocks being the primary drivers of most ASEAN-wide sector and national returns. Moreover, a decreasing impact on most ASEAN-wide sector returns from global and regional shocks is observed. Lastly, the efficient frontier of portfolios consisting of only ASEAN national returns is better than that corresponding to portfolios comprised by ASEAN-wide sector returns.",

The CVaR initially proposed by Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000) has been widely used in financial risk modelling because it can alleviate the well-known limitations of the VaR measure, such as the lack of sub-additivity and convexity (Artzner et al., 1997 (Artzner et al., , 1999 . Although both the CVaR and VaR use threshold values to determine the loss function in the negative tail of the distribution, the CVaR is less optimistic because it models these values in the negative tail exceeding the VaR threshold. Thus, the VaR may underestimate portfolio risk. When the VaR denotes the loss that will not be exceeded at a certain confidence level for a certain time period, the CVaR aims to estimate the loss that could exceed the VaR at a certain confidence level and for the time horizon. The CVaR is known to be a more conservative measure of market risk exposure (Szeg\u00f6, 2002; Uryasev, 2000) .",

The risk measure captures the return distribution in the negative tail by employing probabilities in the forecasting of a portfolio's losses. In this respect, the risk measure provides a probabilistic approximation of the loss that will exceed the VaR where the VaR estimate is a negative tail threshold risk value of the portfolio. The CVaR is considered to be more in tune with the loss function of the negative tails' return distribution because it is less optimistic than the VaR (Szeg\u00f6, 2002; Uryasev, 2000) .

We opt for the usage of weekly data to apply the TENET method because the modelling is more adequate with that type of data according to previous studies (H\u00e4rdle et al., 2016) . Also, as part of the TENET modelling we consider variables such as the implied CBOE volatility index (VIX), the TED spread which is the difference between the 3-month treasury bill and the 3-month LIBOR based in US dollars, the T10Y3M which represents the 10-year treasury constant maturity minus 3-month treasury constant maturity, and the Western Texas Note: Abbreviations , , and denote the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness. The WTI abbreviation means Western Texas Intermediate, while VIX is the implied CBOE volatility index. The TED spread is the difference between the 3-month treasury bill and the 3-month LIBOR based in US dollars. The T10Y3M represents the 10-year treasury constant maturity minus 3-month treasury constant maturity. It can be observed that all banks' historical returns are in the range of zero. In developed America all banks' returns display negative skewness. In emerging America with the exception of the three banks from Brazil (BBAS3, BBDC4, SANB4) all other bank returns display negative skewness. All volatilities are in the range of zero for all banks from developed and emerging America. The kurtosis for all banks is positive and larger than 3 indicating the absence of the normal distribution. In terms of risk (standard deviation) and return trade-offs, the banks from emerging America appear to be the better choice. Table 3 displays the spillovers among banks from emerging America. It can be observed that the largest spillover transmitters and receivers are the banks from Brazil, followed by the banks from Chile. Spillovers between pairs of emerging market banks are larger between banks from the same country, compared with banks from different countries. Specifically, the Banco do Brasil (BBAS3) largely spillovers on Banco Bradesco (BBDC4) from the same country (34.90, 34.88), with the spillover transmission of the former bank being slightly larger than its spillover reception from the latter bank. Banco Santander Chile (BSANTANDER) largely spillovers on Banco de Chile (CHILE) (17.43, 17.13) and Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI) (13.50, 12.43) from the same country, with its spillover transmission to both banks being slightly larger than its spillover reception from them. Grupo Financiero Banorte (GFNORTEO) from Mexico also largely spillovers on Grupo Financiero Inbursa (GFINBURO) (11.94, 12.00) from the same country, with its spillover transmission being smaller than its spillover reception from the latter bank. The largest spillovers between banks across different countries occur between CHILE-CREDITC1 (0.67, 0.22) from Chile and Peru, respectively, with the spillover transmission of the Chilean bank being larger than its spillover reception from the Peruvian bank; between BBO-BBVAC1 (0.64, 0.59) from Colombia and Peru, respectively, with the spillover transmission of the Colombian bank being larger than its spillover reception from the Peruvian bank; between BSANTANDER-BBVAC1 (0.61, 0.03), from Chile and Peru, respectively, with the spillover transmission of the Chilean bank with much larger than its spillover reception from the Peruvian bank; and between BIC-BBVAC1 (0.58, 0.43) from Colombia and Peru, respectively, with the spillover transmission of the Colombian bank being larger than its spillover reception from the Peruvian bank. Accordingly, the largest spillovers between banks across countries in emerging America take place between the banks from Chile and Colombia, and those from Peru, with the banks from the latter country being stronger receivers of spillovers than transmitters. On the contrary, the smallest spillovers across banks from emerging America happen between the Mexican and Colombian banks, specifically between GFNORTEO-BBO (0.03, 0.59), from Mexico and Colombia, respectively, with the spillover transmission of the Mexican bank being much smaller than its spillover reception from the Colombian bank; and between GFNORTEO-BIC (0.04, 0.12), with the spillover transmission of the Mexican bank being much smaller than its spillover reception from the Colombian bank. A comparison of spillover transmission and reception patterns between banks from emerging America and those from developed America reveals that spillovers among banks from emerging America are noticeably smaller.",

The USA economy is significantly much larger than the Canadian economy.

The largest spillovers identified between the USA banks and the Royal Bank of Canada (RY) can also be explained by the higher number and larger size of financial transactions the RY has with the USA banks, relative to other smaller banks from Canada. In this respect, it should be noted that RY is the largest bank in Canada in terms of total assets, making it very attractive to USA banks for investment, trading and borrowing, while having the most assets to make the largest transactions with USA banks. The largest and smallest spillovers between pairs of banks from the USA, and between pairs of banks from Canada can be understood in the light of the above rationale. Hence, when any of those banks is positively or negatively affected by local, regional or global market shocks their return and risk spillover ramifications are the strongest and the largest in the financial industry of the Americas.

Unlike in Table 7 , we observe fewer incoming and outcoming links, implying that the COVID-19 might cut off the complex links among developed and emerging market banks. Table 9 displays results corresponding to the differential evolution optimization of the portfolios of banks from developed and emerging America. From the portfolio of banks from developed America, we observe that the largest risk contributors to total portfolio risk, for an equally weighted portfolio, are three of the largest banks from North America, namely, Morgan Stanley (MS), followed by Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C).

This result is observed for Canadian banks which are the least risk contributors among banks from developed America.

Motivated by the importance of understanding banks interdependence this study examines the network structure of spillovers, the portfolio allocation characteristics and diversification potential of bank returns from developed and emerging America. We draw our empirical results by applying a directional spillover index, the tail-event driven network (TENET) and nonlinear portfolio optimization methods on bank returns. The obtained empirical results indicate that the spillovers and connectedness among banks from emerging America are noticeably smaller than those among banks from developed America. The largest emerging market spillover transmitters and receivers are the banks from Brazil, followed by the banks from Chile. The largest developed market spillover transmitter is JP Morgan Chase. The connectedness among banks from developed America is dominated by the banks from the USA, relative to those from Canada. The total connectedness of the emerging market banks is more intensified than that of the banks from developed America due to the effect of the COVID-19",

This information implies that the portfolio of banks from emerging America offers greater diversification potential.
