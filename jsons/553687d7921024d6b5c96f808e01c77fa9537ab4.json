            "text": "Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 was selected as a bacterial carrier for the development of mucosal vaccine against porcine parvovirus (PPV) infection. The PPV major structural polypeptide VP2 was used as the model parvovirus antigen. Two inducible expression systems, namely pPG611.1 of the cell-surface expression system and pPG612.1 of the secretion expression system based on the xylose operon promoter were used to express the VP2 protein. The immunogenicity of recombinant strains producing VP2 protein in two cellular locations, cell-surface exposed and secreted, was compared to each other by immunizing mice through the intragastric administration. The two types of constructs were able to induce strong specific immune responses against VP2 via intragastric administration and maximum titres of IgA and IgG were attained on days 46 post oral immunization, while the highest antibody levels were obtained with the strain producing the VP2 protein in extracellular milieu. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on PPV infection.",

            "text": "It is now clear that the gastrointestinal mucosas are the primary sites of natural virus transmission and also serve as a reservoir of virus infection and persistence. Although parenteral vaccination is usually effective in eliciting a protective immune response, the response is not desired as the virus enters the body via the mucosal surfaces. This mucosa-centric nature of virus infection provides a strong rationale for development of mucosal vaccines to induce sufficient mucosal response to prevent the virus from establishing the mucosa as a site of continued replication and dissemination to other tissues. [1] [2] [3] Furthermore, these studies suggest that a vaccine that induces local mucosal immunity, in particular the induction of local CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) may control viral replication within local tissues prior to systemic dissemination. 4 These results also provide strong support for development of new generation vaccines that induce mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) against virus. 5, 6 Porcine parvovirus (PPV), an autonomous parvovirus, is a major cause of reproductive failure in swine resulting in early embryonic death, fetal death, stillbirths, and delayed return to oestrus. [7] [8] [9] [10] The viral genome consists of a linear, minus-polarity single-stranded 5 kb DNA, 11 and is constructed of three structural polypeptides with MW of 84 000, 64 000 and 60 000, respectively. 12 The VP2 structural polypeptide encompasses the major antigenic domains and could induce neutralizing antibodies for neutralization of PPV infection. 13, 14 Like many other pathogens, the PPV initiates its infectious cycle at the mucosal surfaces, 7,15 especially intestinal mucosal epithelial surface. Efficient protection against mucosal infections requires the development of new vaccines that induce protective immune responses not only at systemic level, but also mucosal level in order to prevent or reduce dissemination of virus at the mucosa. This can best be achieved by mucosal vaccination, a route which offers several advantages over the traditional parenteral vaccines. [16] [17] [18] However, as the local administration of pure antigens or subunit vaccines is usually rather inefficient, several strategies have been developed to deliver the antigen in an immunogenic and protected form at the targeted mucosa. One promising approach relies on the use of live bacterial vehicles. [19] [20] [21] The potential development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal immune X. U. Yigang and L. I. Yijing system has been proposed; [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] these have many properties that make them attractive candidates as antigen delivery carriers for the presentation to the mucosa of compounds with pharmaceutical interest, in particular vaccines. For example, LAB have long been used in industrial food fermentation and preservation and are known for the beneficial effects on the health of humans and animals, and considered 'generally regarded as safe, GRAS' micro-organisms. In addition, many strains of LAB are able to survive and colonize in the intestinal tract. 28, 29 and induce a non-specific immunoadjuvant effect; 30 this has provoked serial studies aimed at determining the capability and feasibility of the application of LAB as safe oral vaccines.",

            "text": "Infection with PPV is of economic concern to pig breeders worldwide. The initial infection of PPV mainly occurs at the mucosa of intestines; this is a critical step in the infection process. 7 Vaccination is the main prophylatic method of preventing PPV infection. Parenteral vaccination is usually effective in eliciting systemic immune responses; however, the responses obtained can not prevent the virus from entering the body via the mucosal surfaces. Therefore, the elicitation of efficient immune response, not only at the systemic, but also at the mucosal level is highly desirable after vaccination. This goal can be only achieved when the vaccine formulation is administered by the mucosal route. As such, a great deal of research is currently focused on the development of adequate mucosal vaccines, with various vaccine delivery systems being explored for oral application. Attenuated pseudorabies virus carrying the VP2 protein of PPV was able to protect mice against viral challenge. 37 Other live vectors such as vaccinia virus expressing PPV proteins stimulated protective immune responses. However, the majority of these live vectors are potentially risk prone. LAB are of increasing interest for the expression of heterologous molecules. 38 The absence of an outer membrane in these Gram-positive micro-organisms makes them particularly attractive for the display or secretion of biologically active molecules. To date, series of recombinant lactobacilli expressing heterologous pathogen antigens have been constructed, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens PsaA and PspA, 26 transmissible gastroentritis coronavirus S glycoprotein, 27 tetanus toxin fragment C. 23, 24 and cholera toxin B subunit. 39 In this study, we engineered for the first time, using L. casei 393 to express the PPV main immune protective antigen VP2 protein with two xylose-induced expression systems pPG611.1, pPG612.1 to explore the potential value as oral vaccine. The VP2 protein was expressed in the external milieu and on cell surface, respectively, whose own good antigenic properties could be recognized by antiserum.",

In contrast, rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2 expressing VP2 in the external milieu induced much higher antibody level of local mucosal or systemic immune response in mice than that elicited by rLc393:pPG611.1-VP2 displaying VP2 on cell surface. Statistically significant differences were observed on days 32, 46 and 58. As estimated by quantitative immunoblot analysis, this difference could be related to varying levels of VP2 production depending on the cellular location of the antigen; therefore, the strong immunogenicity most probably results from the high level of external milieu VP2 product in rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2, which could effectively reacted with intestine mucosal tissues. We hypothesize that the VP2 protein expressed by rLc393:pPG611.1-VP2 may be embedded in the cell wall and only partly accessible to cell surface, which could not fully associate with gut lymphoid tissue resulting in the lower level of immune antibodies than that induced by rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2. Furthermore, in order to confirm the efficacy of the induced antibodies in inhibiting the virus, we tested whether intestinal lavages and sera collected from immunized mice could inhibit the infection of ST cells in a plaque reduction neutralization assay. The results showed that serum and intestinal samples collected from mice immunized with rLc393:pPG612.1-VP2 demonstrated statistically significant inhibition. Although the pPG611.1 recombinant vector could also induce the neutralizing antibodies, the neutralization by intestinal lavage antibodies obtained from mice immunized with pPG612.1 recombinant vector was more effective than that after immunization of mice with the pPG611.1 recombinant vector.",

Several factors may explain these differences. Successful mucosal immunization requires the delivery of a minimal threshold load of antigen. Therefore, it is possible that the recombinant strain described by Shaw et al. produces insufficient antigen quantities at the cell surface. Alternatively, intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of L. casei ATCC 393, yet to be determined, may differ from those of L. plantarum 256, used by Shaw et al. The strain used in this study was able to adhere and colonize the intestinal tracts and tolerate bile (data not shown), which would render it more appropriate an oral vaccine carrier with the probiotic effects and the harmless nature of L. casei 393.",
