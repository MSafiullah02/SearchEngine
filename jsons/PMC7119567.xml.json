            "text": "The coronavirus genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule that is 20\u201330 kb in size (Murphy, 1996, Siddell, 1995). Virions are enveloped, pleomorphic, 80\u2013220 nm in diameter and they have club-shaped peplomers. According to the generally accepted model of coronavirus structure, viral genomic RNA is complexed with a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, N protein, in a helical configuration. The surrounding envelope contains three viral proteins. The trimeric spike (S) protein, the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies (Gebauer et al., 1991), forms characteristic viral peplomers which are involved in virus attachment on the cell receptors and in virus cell fusion (de Hann et al., 2000). The small membrane protein (E), recognized recently as a structural component of the coronavirus, has been found to be important for assembly of the viral envelope (Raamsman et al., 2000). The membrane (M) glycoprotein is the most abundant structural protein; it spans the membrane bilayer three times, leaving a short NH2-terminal domain outside the virus and a long COOH terminus inside the virion (Rottier, 1995). The M protein induces antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus neutralization (Woods et al., 1987). Although its function is not completely clear, M seems to play a key role in virus assembly and budding.",

The amplified products, 0.8 kb in length, were gel purified and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen), and the constructs transformed into E. coli TOP10F cells (Invitrogen). Transformants selected on 2\u00d7TY plates containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) were screened by direct colony PCR, and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequence of inserts was verified. The sequence data obtained were compared with the sequence of the M gene of CCoV strain Insavc (accession number D13096). The alignment performed by custal w software revealed more than 90% of nucleotide identity between the two sequences.",

A colony of cells of E. coli M15[pREP4] transformed recently was inoculated into 1 l of 2\u00d7TY in presence of ampicillin, at 100 \u03bcg/ml and kanamycin, at 25 \u03bcg/ml, and culture was grown at 30 \u00b0C until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 1.2. Then isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mM to induce the expression of rMP, and the incubation was continued for further 8 h. Control cultures containing the empty pQE30 vector were processed in parallel. The rMP accumulated in the bacteria as inclusion bodies. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and used for the preparation of inclusion bodies (Fiermonte et al., 1993). Cells from a liter of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of a buffer containing Hepes-NaOH 10 mM and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7, disrupted in a French press and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C at 27 000\u00d7g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and fractionated by centrifugation at 131 000\u00d7g for 4.5 h at 4 \u00b0C through a step gradient, 10 ml of 40%, 15 ml of 53% and 4 ml of 72% (w/v) solutions of sucrose dissolved in the buffer. The inclusion bodies gathered as a grey band at the interface between the 53 and 72% layers. They were recovered and washed with 20 ml of buffer containing 3% of Triton-X114 and centrifuged at 27 000\u00d7g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in a further 2 ml of buffer without detergent. Inclusion bodies, membrane fractions and samples taken from cultures at various point of growth were examined by PAGE in the presence of SDS on 17.5% gels (Laemmli, 1970). The proteins either were stained with Coomassie Blue dye or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF Immobilon P, pore size 0.45 \u03bcm) to determine the N-terminal sequence of the recombinant M protein. To eliminate few bacterial contaminants present in the inclusion bodies, the rMP was gel purified by electroelution.",
