            "text": "Background: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is one of the leading causes of intensive care unit admission and is associated with high mortality. Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network metaanalysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Methods: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology.",

Classically, standard oxygen therapy (SOT) has been the conventional approach evaluated. Standard oxygen therapy provides low-flow oxygen (< 15 L/min) using different interfaces such as nasal prongs, Venturi system, and non-rebreather masks. In the early 2000s, noninvasive ventilation provided by a face mask (FM-NIV) was shown to be superior to SOT in two small single-center randomized controlled trials (RCT) [10, 11] . In 2015, a large RCT failed to show superiority of FM-NIV on the rates of endotracheal intubation and all-cause mortality compared to SOT in immunocompromised patients [12] . More recently, the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) gained interest and use among clinicians as an alternative method to provide noninvasive oxygenation [15] [16] [17] . A large 3-arm RCT recently compared the efficacy of HFNC, FM-NIV, and SOT in adults with AHRF [13] . Although this study did not show a benefit in the primary outcome (invasive mechanical ventilation at 28 days), HFNC was associated with decreased all-cause mortality at 90 days. Furthermore, a post hoc subgroup analysis showed that in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 :FiO 2 < 200 mmHg) HFNC decreased the need of invasive ventilation when compared with the other two modalities. Notably, the highest mortality was seen among the FM-NIV treatment arm. This study started to raise concerns for potential harmful effects associated with FM-NIV, which were further supported by two large observational studies [18, 19] . Potential mechanisms of harm attributable to FM-NIV as compared to HFNC include the poor tolerance of the face-mask interface, increased risk of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and the inability to limit tidal volumes leading to high transpulmonary pressures and ventilator-and patient-inflicted lung injury [20] [21] [22] . As a result, recent guidelines have expressed uncertainty regarding the use of FM-NIV for the treatment of de novo AHRF [7] . Interestingly, in a subsequent study comparing HFNC vs SOT among immunocompromised patients, there were no differences noted in rates of invasive mechanical ventilation or mortality [14] .",

            "text": "The use of a helmet interface to provide NIV (H-NIV) poses an attractive alternative to provide both oxygenation and ventilation in AHRF, potentially with better patient tolerability, patient-ventilator interaction, and the ability to provide ventilation for longer periods of time [23] . The potential benefits of H-NIV compared to SOT and FM-NIV to decrease the risk of ETI has been supported by recent RCTs [24] [25] [26] [27] . In an RCT study conducted in 2010, H-NIV was found to decrease mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to SOT in patients with hematologic malignancy [26] . Helmet-NIV was also found to decrease rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in a more recent single-center RCT compared to FM-NIV [25] . There are a series of physiologic mechanisms that may explain these results-predominantly related to the helmet interface. The helmet interface may act to decrease air leaks when compared to the face mask interface. This may permit more effective delivery of higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure potentially increasing alveolar recruitment and decreasing respiratory drive [2, 8, 22, 27] . Furthermore, patients with AHRF seem to have better tolerance for a helmet interface minimizing the time that the therapy requires interruption-something not uncommon for FM-NIV [25] . Interestingly, there are currently no available head to head comparisons of H-NIV and HFNC for relevant clinical outcomes such as mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation.",
