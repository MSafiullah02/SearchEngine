            "text": "Entry of enveloped viruses depends on several cellular components, including protein or carbohydrate receptors and oftentimes co-receptors that both bind viruses to cells and catalyze the initial stages of viral surface protein refolding. 1 Endocytosis is a common prerequisite to successful entry; both the acidic pH and the proteases of the endosome can create further structural changes in the viral proteins mediating cell receptor binding and virus-cell membrane fusion. 2 Finally, an appropriate lipid environment, often abundant in sterols, is also frequently necessary to achieve facile fusion of viral and cellular membranes. 3 In numerous seminal investigations, each of these steps has been dissected by blocking virus entry with mutant transgenes or with drugs that alter receptors or endosome or lipid environments. Although these are powerful approaches, the findings can be complicated when the transgenes or drugs create untoward pleiotropic changes in cellular functions. A complementary reductionist approach involves in vitro virus entry in which enveloped viruses are bound to and then fused into synthetic liposomes. 4 In these test-tube reactions, receptors, pH, proteases and liposome bilayer compositions can be precisely defined and freely altered in ways not achievable in living cells. Such systems are useful adjuncts to understanding the biochemistry of enveloped virus entry.",

We aimed to advance these studies by creating liposomes that more closely reflect authentic MHVsusceptible cells. To this end, we created synthetic liposomes containing nickelnitriloacetic acid (NiNTA) adducts on a fraction of lipid head groups. Soluble MHV receptors containing engineered polyhistidine tags could then be attached to the liposomes, thereby creating artificial targets for virus binding. These liposomes with attached receptors have been useful in identifying the requirements for irreversible association of MHV to target membranes during entry.",

These liposomes were then mixed with baculovirus-expressed soluble MHV receptors containing C-terminal 6xhistidine tags. 7 These soluble receptors are designated soluble Carcino-Embryonic-Antigen, or sCEA6his. To remove unbound receptors, we adjusted the mixtures to contain 50% w/v sucrose, then overlaid stepwise with 40% -30% -10% w/v sucrose solutions and floated the liposomes to the 10-30% sucrose interface by ultracentrifugation. The liposome:sCEA6his complexes were collected and stored at 4 o C. Estimates of the sCEA-6xhis concentrations by titration and immunoblotting indicated that our typical preparations had densities of ~50 sCEA per 100-nm liposome.",

The fusion reaction pathway is of the \"class I\" type 9 refolding into helical bundles. In a productive process, this refolding is preceded by , which involves a temperature-dependent insertion of hydrophobic spike peptides, so-called fusion peptides, into target membranes. We are currently hypothesizing that the stabilized association of MHV with synthetic liposomes results from the insertion of their fusion peptides into the liposome membranes. If this hypothesis is borne out, then we can suggest that the intercalation of fusion peptides is strongly temperature-dependent but does not require cholesterol in the target membranes.",

It is entirely possible that components required to complete the MHV membrane fusion process are missing from our in vitro assays. Fusion may require exposure to acids or proteases, may require proteinaceous co-factors in addition to the principal CEA receptors, and likely also requires specific sterol-containing lipid environments.
