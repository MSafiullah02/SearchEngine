The viral replication machinery is a complex assembly of viral, and in some cases, host proteins. However, at the heart of the replication machinery is the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). RdRPs have been shown to display a high mutation rate compared to their DNA counterparts (Drake, 1993, Drake, 1999). This decrease in fidelity exhibited by RdRPs has been suggested to be the primary contributing factor for the variability in RNA virus genomes.",

The determination of RNA virus mutation frequencies has been accomplished by evaluating the following: (i) development of resistance to antiviral agents; (ii) escape from monoclonal antibody treatment; (iii) changes in virus fitness; (iv) serial passage of the virus in cell culture or in vivo followed by direct sequencing (Table 1\n). Unfortunately, mutations that produce replication-incompetent or perhaps translation-incompetent genomes are not scored in these assays. Therefore, direct measurements of the intrinsic error rate of the RdRP obtained from in vitro analysis is the simplest approach to define the upper limit for the mutational frequency of a RNA virus.",

As the number of mutations in the viral genomes increases and passes this error threshold, the fitness decreases significantly, ultimately resulting in extinction. Therefore, agents that increase the mutation frequency of the virus should be effective antivirals. This prediction was confirmed by studies of ribavirin that showed that the mechanism of action of this antiviral agent is lethal mutagenesis (Crotty et al., 2001, Crotty et al., 2000).",

This RNA substrate consists of a 10-nucleotide heteropolymeric RNA that is self-complementary and forms a six base-pair duplex region with an identical 4-nucleotide 5\u2032-overhang on both sides of the primer/template. Both 3\u2032-hydroxyls of the substrate are competent for templated extension resulting in a symmetrical substrate, termed sym/sub (Arnold and Cameron, 2000) (Fig. 1). The enzyme binds productively to sym/sub regardless of the orientation of binding and regardless of which of the two 3\u2032-hydroxyls is in the catalytic center. The 4-nucleotide template permits either single or multiple rounds of nucleotide incorporation to be evaluated by selecting the appropriate nucleotide or nucleotides employed in the reaction. 3Dpol\u2013sym/sub complexes recapitulate a biologically relevant elongation complex (Gohara et al., 2000); therefore, analysis of the mechanism of nucleotide incorporation in vitro using this substrate is likely to be relevant to the reaction in vivo.",

These parameters are expressed by the kinetic constants: K\nd,app, k\npol and k\npol/K\nd,app, respectively (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b). The fidelity of the viral RdRP can be obtained by comparing k\npol/K\nd,app values for correct and incorrect nucleotides. A complete kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of poliovirus 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation revealed that nucleotide incorporation can be described by the five steps shown in Scheme 1\n(Arnold and Cameron, 2004b). The 3Dpol\u2013sym/sub complex (ERn) binds nucleotide (NTP) to form a ternary complex (ERnNTP) that undergoes a conformational change to form a complex that is competent for phosphoryl transfer (*ERnNTP). Chemistry occurs, forming a ternary product complex (*ERn+1PPi); this complex isomerizes to form a ternary product complex (ERn+1PPi) from which PPi can dissociate. After dissociation of PPi, a 3Dpol\u2013sym/sub product complex (ERn+1) remains that is competent for the next cycle of nucleotide incorporation. For poliovirus 3Dpol, two steps in the mechanism are partially rate-limiting for correct nucleotide incorporation: the conformational-change step (step 2) prior to phosphoryl transfer and the phosphoryl-transfer step (step 3) (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b).",

            "text": "It has been well documented that substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ as the divalent cation cofactor in polymerase-catalyzed reactions decreases the stringency of substrate selection and incorporation fidelity (Arnold et al., 1999, Beckman et al., 1985, Goodman et al., 1983, Huang et al., 1997, Liu and Tsai, 2001, Tabor and Richardson, 1989). However, the detailed mechanistic basis for the destructive effects of Mn2+ was not completely understood until recently (Arnold et al., 2004). By using Mn2+ as the divalent cation cofactor, the ability to diminish the rate of phosphoryl transfer for incorrect nucleotides relative to correct nucleotides is lost completely, leaving only the conformational-change step for nucleotide selection (Scheme 2\n) (Arnold et al., 2004). When Mn2+ is employed as the divalent cation, the conformation of the metal-bound triphosphate coupled with the additional adventitious interactions that can occur between the enzyme and Mn2+ increases the stability of the activated ternary complex (Scheme 2, step 2). Compared to reactions in the presence of Mg2+, the increase in stability of the activated ternary complex is the same regardless of the nature of the nucleotide (correct or incorrect). In addition, the capacity of Mn2+ to bind more tightly to the \u03b2 and \u03b3 phosphates makes the orientation of the triphosphate independent of interactions with residues in the ribose-binding pocket. Consequently, perturbations in the orientation of the triphosphate will not occur in response to binding of a nucleotide with an incorrect base or sugar configuration. Therefore, the inability to couple the nature of the bound nucleotide to the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer is the primary reason for the observed loss of 3Dpol fidelity in the presence of Mn2+.",

Restated, these two steps would be used by the enzyme to distinguish a correct nucleotide from an incorrect nucleotide. Through evaluation of the differences between correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by 3Dpol, it was found that there is no difference in ground-state binding (step 1) regardless of the nucleotide substrate employed (Table 2, Fig. 3\n). Therefore, ground-state binding cannot contribute to the process of nucleotide substrate selection. The reason for this observation likely reflects the use of the triphosphate for ground-state binding instead of the ribose or base. However, the two steps in the kinetic mechanism for nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by 3Dpol that provide the greatest contribution to fidelity are formation of the activated ternary complex (step 2) and phosphoryl transfer (step 3) (Scheme 1, Scheme 2, Fig. 3).",

The model for nucleotide binding in Fig. 2, Fig. 4 can be expanded to include these interactions. The first step is binding of the nucleotide in the ground state. In this ground-state configuration, the ribose cannot bind in a productive orientation because the interaction between Asp-238 and Asn-297 observed in the unliganded enzyme occludes the ribose-binding pocket (Gohara et al., 2000, Gohara et al., 2004). A conformational change occurs that orients the triphosphate for phosphoryl transfer. This transition is proposed to be partially rate-limiting for correct nucleotide incorporation (step 2 in Scheme 1) (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b; Arnold et al., 2004). Moreover, the stability of the complex in this conformation will dictate the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer as any movement in the position of the triphosphate will produce either a suboptimal orientation or a suboptimal distance for catalysis. In order to maintain the triphosphate in the appropriate orientation, an extensive hydrogen-bonding network is involved that can be traced to residues in the ribose-binding pocket (Fig. 5B) (Gohara et al., 2004). Formation of this network requires reorientation of Asp-238 and Asn-297 as well as interaction of the oxygen of the \u03b2-phosphate with the 3\u2032-OH of the nucleotide substrate. The position of the ribose is held firmly by interactions between the 3\u2032-OH and the backbone of Asp-238 and by interactions between the 2\u2032-OH and Asn-297. The backbone of Asp-238 is restricted by the interaction of the Asp-238 side chain with other residues in the pocket, perhaps Ser-288 and Thr-293 (Fig. 5B). The appropriate organization of this complex will permit binding and/or alignment of the second divalent cation cofactor, permitting phosphoryl transfer, translocation and pyrophosphate release (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b; Arnold et al., 2004).",

This model explains the observation that both the conformational change preceding phosphoryl transfer and phosphoryl transfer are reduced for 2\u2032-dAMP incorporation by 3Dpol (Table 2) (Arnold and Cameron, 2004b; Arnold et al., 2004) or AMP incorporation by the N297A derivative (Gohara et al., 2000, Gohara et al., 2004).

Stabilization of the triphosphate conformation requires conserved structural motif A (Fig. 6\n). Stabilization of the triphosphate-metal complex in the active conformation requires of a network of hydrogen bonds provided mostly by the backbone of the residues in motif A (Fig. 6). Therefore, any movement of the motif A side chains located in the sugar-binding pocket will be transmitted through the rest of motif A, consequently perturbing the position of both the sugar and triphosphate and reducing the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer as described above for Asp-238 of 3Dpol. The position of residues in motif A can be altered both by either the base or the ribose of the nucleotide (Fig. 6). Similar to Asn-297 (motif B) for 3Dpol, T7 RNA polymerase uses His-784 (motif B) for hydrogen bonding to the 2\u2032-OH of the NTP substrate (Brieba and Sousa, 2000). In HIV RT, Phe-160 (motif B) has van der Waals interactions with the 2\u2032-H of the 2\u2032-dNTP substrate (Gutierrez-Rivas et al., 1999). In the presence of a 2\u2032-OH, Phe-160 will cause movement of Tyr-115 (motif A). Likewise, the presence of a motif B residue in DNA polymerases (e.g. T7, BF, KF, Taq and RB69) will cause movement of motif A via the motif A residue located in the sugar-binding pocket (Beese et al., 1993, Cheetham and Steitz, 1999, Doublie et al., 1998, Johnson et al., 2003, Li et al., 1998, Yin and Steitz, 2002).",

Nucleotide binding by G64S 3Dpol is equivalent to wild-type 3Dpol regardless of the nature of the nucleotide, correct or incorrect, consistent with the finding that binding is governed primarily by the triphosphate moiety (Table 3). However, the overall efficiency of RMP and GMP incorporation was reduced significantly relative to wild-type 3Dpol, suggesting a decrease in either the conformational-change step or the phosphoryl-transfer step (Table 3). The fidelity of G64S 3Dpol increased compared to wild-type enzyme, and the capacity of the G64S substitution to permit decreased utilization of RTP could be explained by increased fidelity of this derivative relative to wild-type 3Dpol. The mechanistic basis for this increased fidelity is a change in the stability of the activated ternary complex compared to wild-type 3Dpol (Arnold and Cameron, 2004a). The ability to show that an amino acid substitution in 3Dpol that increases polymerase fidelity causes a change in step 2 (Scheme 1) provides an undisputable link between this step and fidelity (Showalter and Tsai, 2002).",

It is conceivable that small molecules can be developed that bind to surfaces of the polymerase and modulate fidelity. Compounds that increase incorporation fidelity should make the virus more susceptible to pressures that could be evaded by population diversity, for example, the immune system. Compounds that decrease incorporation fidelity should force the virus into error catastrophe. Clearly, this strategy will prevent the complications associated with nucleoside-based polymerase inhibitors. Importantly, these small molecules can be \u201crecycled\u201d in a mechanism in which the antiviral would bind to the activated ternary complex, altering its fidelity and then be released.",
