The 'lockdowners' argue for tighter restrictions, succinctly summarised by New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's instructions to \"act like you have COVID-19\" [2] or more formally defined as mandatory mass quarantine. The lockdowners' argument is that reducing the duration of the crisis period will reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and decrease the period of disruption to the economy.",

The basis for the gradual approach is that keeping as many people in work for as long as possible is more likely to result in a functioning economy once the crisis is over. As Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has highlighted, it is also important to consider the potential adverse effects of lockdown on the well-being of the population, which may include psychological effects and physical effects, e.g. from reduced access to health care and increased domestic violence-the isolation effects [3] .",

Figure 1 presents a decision tree that describes the pathways and outcomes associated with maintaining a gradual steps approach relative to the immediate implementation of a mandatory lockdown policy.

Additional COVID-19 cases will also be experienced in the period prior to a lockdown.

The decision tree can then be analysed to estimate the probabilities that maintaining a gradual steps policy will result in better or worse outcomes than an immediate lockdown policy. The probability that the economic effects will be better is estimated as the probability of the 'later lockdown not required' scenario multiplied by the probability that the economic effects will be better if a lockdown is avoided, which is 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.25, a one in four chance.",

The simple analysis presented in this editorial could be extended to represent differences in the expected magnitudes of the economic and isolation effects in different scenarios, but the implied policy option of the presented decision analysis seems quite clear. The scenarios tested suggest that a decision to maintain a gradual steps approach implies governments are willing to trade-off increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths for reduced economic and isolation effects. More importantly, it implies governments are highly confident that a mandatory lockdown will not be required at a later date AND that a longer but less intense period of social distancing is highly likely to reduce the economic and isolation effects of the crisis AND that a more equitable distribution of the effects of the crisis is not a significant policy objective.",
