The observed evolution from pneumonic injury to respiratory death in this disease suggests a pathological pathway that might be amenable to early CT detection, particularly if the patient is scanned 2 or more days after developing symptoms. Additionally, a negative CT 1 week after the onset of symptoms is reported to have a high negative predictive value for COVID-19 pneumonia. The prognostic value of CT would be further enhanced if it was able to define early radiological abnormalities or patterns that portend a poor outcome. Strict requirements for cleaning of scanning suites in between cases will, however, place considerable challenges on patient throughput. In the rapidly changing landscape of this pandemic, new data are emerging from affected regions on an almost daily basis. In this context, the British Society of Thoracic Imaging have issued guidance that underscores the importance of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic assessment in suspected COVID-19 cases, with CT reserved for patients who are critically ill and for when there is diagnostic uncertainty.12 Emerging data will clarify if CT also has a role to play in prognostication and disease monitoring.",
