In two cases Sia has been identified as an internal sugar between neutral sugars: Fuc\u03b11!O glycolyl Neu5Gc\u03b12-4Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Glc1-in echinoderms [39] and a polymer of !4Neu5Ac\u03b12!6Glc/Gal1 disaccharide in the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups Y and W-135, respectively [40] . Moreover, Sias can be linked to each other to form diSia, oligoSia, and polySia (by definition DP > 8 is termed polySia). First identified in the glycocalyx of neuroinvasive bacteria, polySia has so far been demonstrated to be a posttranslational modification on six glycoproteins, the fish egg polysialoglycoprotein (PSGP), the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a voltage-gated sodium channel in eel, CD36 in human milk, NRP2 in human lymphocytes, and SynCAM-1 in mouse brain (for recent reviews see [41] [42] [43] ). Polysialylation occurs in some tumors (probably on NCAM) and is involved in metastasis. By virtue of its net negative charge at physiological pH and exclusive volume, polySia serves as a mediator of ligand-receptor and cell-cell interactions via an anti-adhesive effect [44] . In addition, polySia has been demonstrated to function as a reservoir molecule for BDNF, dopamine, and FGF-2 [41, 43, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] and to be involved in the regulation of ion transport via interactions with channels [32, [50] [51] [52] . Compared to what is known about polySia, the information on oligoSia is limited [43, 53, 54] . DiSia and oligoSia are common glyco-epitopes between glycolipids and glycoproteins. The functions of diSia on the glycolipids (GD3 and GT1b) have been well studied, while far less knowledge about the functions of diSia and oligoSia on the glycoproteins has been reported [55] [56] [57] . Interestingly, oligoSia and polySia with the degree of polymerization up to 16 have been recently found in glycolipids of sea urchin sperm [58] , although their functions remain to be elucidated. To quantitate the amount of Sia at 0.1-100 \u03bcg, colorimetric analyses are most common with simple methods, and include the thiobarbituric acid [59, 60] and resorcinol methods [61] . In the resorcinol method, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc in either free or bound form can be equally detected, while Kdn gives no color. In the thiobarbituric acid, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are detected only in free form, while Kdn can be detected in both free and bound forms. To quantitate the amount of Sia below 0.1 \u03bcg, a highly sensitive fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method is usually used.

In this analysis, a free form of various Sia species is labeled with the fluorescent dye 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), and fluorometrically analyzed on HPLC [62, 63] . DMB is a reagent which specifically reacts with \u03b1-keto acids, and detects not only Sia but also typical \u03b1-keto acids such as pyruvate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Fluorometric HPLC analysis consists of the following steps: step 1, acid hydrolysis of sialoglycoconjugates to release free Sia; step 2, fluorescent labeling of released Sia with DMB; step 3, separation and quantification of DMB-labeled Sia on HPLC. Fluorometric HPLC analysis involves two acidic conditions. One is a hydrolysis, 0.1 N trifluoroacetic acid at 80 C for 2 h to release free Sia from sialoglycoconjugates at step 1. The second is the DMB labeling which takes place in 0.01 N trifluoroacetic acid at 50 C for 3 h (step 2). Attention must therefore be given to the acid lability of some Sia substituents. No significant degradation of Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn has been reported. For SiaS, the glycosidic bonds of SiaS were completely hydrolyzed under the hydrolysis conditions, while their sulfate esters are hydrolyzed by, at most, 4% [64] . No apparent desulfation occurred under the labeling conditions. The O-acetyl groups on Sia are very labile to basic conditions and more stable under acidic conditions. Although no quantitative data are available for the lability of O-acetyl group during the DMB-derivatization procedures, quantitative analysis is basically possible as long as authentic O-acetylated Sia compounds are used as a standard. It is of interest to note that the 8-O-acetyl ester is more labile than a 9-O-acetyl ester, and acetyl-groups tend to migrate to the C-9 position at the end, even under neutral conditions at room temperature [65] .

The O-acetylated Sia are eluted more slowly than the corresponding non-O-acetylated Sia. To separate the various SiaS from each other, an acidic solution of acetonitrile/methanol/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (9:7:84 by volume) [64] is recommended. This solution will enable the separation of DMB derivatives of Neu5Ac8S, Neu5Ac9S, Neu5Gc8S, and Neu5Gc9S.

Direct demonstration of the presence of 9-Oacetylated Sias in mammalian tissues was indirect (modifications of the PAS technique) until the development of a chimeric dual-functional probe derived from influenza-C hemagglutinin esterase (InfCHE). This probe was constructed using a soluble and versatile form of the InfCHE that retains both the hemagglutinin and esterase activity and also has the binding properties of IgG Fc. The esterase activity is very similar to that of the native protein, and pH conditions can be adjusted to remove either 9-O-acetyl groups alone or both 9-and 7-O-acetyl groups completely (by causing migration of the latter to the 9-carbon position). DFP (di-isopropyl fluorophosphates) inactivation stabilizes and \"unmasks\" the hemagglutinin activity, resulting in a probe that specifically detects 9-O-acetylated sialic acids at ambient temperatures. Since CHE-FcD and CHE-Fc differ only by a single di-isopropyl group, each can be used as control for the other. Thus, when the CHE-Fc is used to remove 9-O-acetyl esters, the CHE-FcD can be used as an inactive control. Conversely, when CHE-FcD is used to probe for 9-O-acetylated Sias, the CHE-Fc can be used as a control for nonspecific binding. The two forms can even be used sequentially; i.e., treatment with CHE-Fc can be used to remove the 9-O-acetyl esters prior to probing with CHE-FcD, leaving only nonspecific staining, if any. It should be noted that the CHE-Fc does have a masked hemagglutinin activity, which can give a weak positive response at low temperatures, and even at ambient temperatures if the density of O-acetylated Sias is very high [6, [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . Tissue expression of 9-O-acetylated Sias was best analyzed using frozen sections, using the probe CHE-FcD pre-complexed to the secondary antibody. There were differences in expression of 9-O-acetylated Sias in tissues isolated from rats and those from mice. As shown Fig. 7 , there was abundant expression in rat liver, rat lung, in the glomeruli of rat kidney, and gray matter of rat brain.

Scale bar \u00bc 50 \u03bcm Structural diversity of Sia is not so large in each animal compared with that which we know in nature. In humans, Neu5Ac is a dominant Sia species, with NeuGc and Kdn contributing to only small amounts. 9-O-Acetylated Neu5Ac is a major modified Sia, but is still a minor form of total Neu5Ac in human. In rainbow trout, on the other hand, Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn appear to be equally expressed, although in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, which Sia species each animal expresses for particular biological roles depends on the animal species.

Scale bar \u00bc 50 \u03bcm the selection of Sia species may come from critical interactions for survival of life, such as pathogen-host interactions, and species-specific sperm-egg interactions in fertilization. Thus, in some cases, a particular Sia species is specifically functional; in other cases, no specific Sia is necessary. The presence of Kdn-specific sialidase in bacteria, the preferential recognition of Neu5Gc by mouse siglec-2, and an inhibitory effect of polySia, but not di-and oligoSia, on homophilic binding of NCAM may exemplify the significance of the structural diversity of Sia species. Importantly, modifications of Sia are often changed dynamically, including the O-acetylation/ de-O-acetylation cycle and transient degradation of polySia to oligoSia. However, currently there is very little knowledge available about the enzymes involved in these modification/re-modification reactions.
