Tregs also control immune responsiveness to infective pathogens (Belkaid and Tarbell, 2009), and in this context, their influence is not always benign. In this review, we survey our current knowledge of the role of Tregs in a wide range of infection settings and highlight the examples in which these cells are of critical importance in conferring susceptibility, dampening pathogenesis, and maintaining functional immunity.",

While this interaction is popularly termed the \u201cHygiene Hypothesis\u201d (see Section 6 below), it is clearly highly context-dependent, and we also review the emerging evidence that some infectious agents in particular are able to alter the immune status of their host through the regulatory T cell compartment.",

            "text": "Regulatory T cells encompass several distinct phenotypes of immune system cells able to block or suppress immune reactivity in vivo and in vitro. While the most well-characterized Treg subset is a dedicated lineage selected in the thymus, there is peripheral conversion of potential effector cells into the Treg compartment, and evidence that additional T cell types engage transiently in regulatory activity or combine production of regulatory cytokines with more conventional effector products. The predominant Treg types are CD4+ and express either or both the surface IL-2R\u03b1 chain CD25 and the forkhead box transcription factor Foxp3 (Gavin et al., 2007). The CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ phenotype also commonly expresses the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 (Alegre et al., 2001) as well as the GITR receptor which can activate both regulatory and nonregulatory T cells (Shimizu et al., 2002). In addition to Foxp3-expressing Tregs are other functional regulatory cells, which may produce IL-10 (termed Tr1) and IL-35 (Tr35) (Collison et al., 2010). In the case of Tr1, as IL-10 can also be produced by both Th1 (IFN\u03b3+ (Jankovic et al., 2007)) and Th2 (IL-4+) effectors, definition of this subset is relatively fluid. Moreover, T cells producing TGF-\u03b2, originally named Th3, can also act in a regulatory capacity. Finally, while Tregs are generally found to be CD4+, CD8+ T cells can express Foxp3 (Nakagawa et al., 2010) and produce the same suppressive cytokines.",

Thymic, or \u201cnatural,\u201d regulatory T cells recognize self-antigens in the thymus and are imprinted with regulatory function before being released into the periphery. Thymic Tregs are a CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ phenotype, and deficiency of these cells results in fatal autoimmune inflammation; this subset remains committed to this function over time (Rubtsov et al., 2010). In addition, naive peripheral CD4+ T cells can be induced to adopt a regulatory function by initiating expression of Foxp3 (or indeed, TGF-\u03b2, IL-10, or IL-35). In particular, induced or \u201cadaptive\u201d Tregs can convert from CD4+Foxp3\u2212 to CD4+Foxp3+, as discussed further below, thereby expanding the range of Treg specificities to exogenous antigens (Bluestone and Abbas, 2003). However, induced Tregs are not irrevocably programmed and may revert to an effector phenotype, losing expression of CD25 and Foxp3 under certain conditions.",

(1985)). While landmark studies were achieved with these methods, it was recognized that effector populations can also be compromised by anti-CD25 antibody, and that a substantial minority of Foxp3+ Tregs do not, at any one time, express CD25. In recent years, it has been possible to better target Foxp3+ Tregs, through the construction of transgenic mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the Treg-specific Foxp3 promoter. Constructs described to date include the DEREG (Lahl et al., 2007) and Foxp3LuciDTR (Suffner et al., 2010) mice, both of which have transgenic BACs randomly inserted, and the Foxp3DTR mouse (Kim et al., 2007, Lund et al., 2008) containing a construct knocked-in to the Foxp3 locus on the X chromosome. Administration of diphtheria toxin (DTx) selectively depletes Tregs, although transiently and sparing cells which downregulate Foxp3 or (in the case of the BAC transgenics) suppress the randomly integrated locus.",

Depletion of CD25+ T cells from persistently infected mice did not consistently improve the ability of CD8+ T cells to control virus loads, but treatment of FV-infected mice with anti-GITR resulted in rescue of CD8+ T cell dysfunction and reversal of retrovirus-induced immunosuppression (Dittmer et al., 2004, He et al., 2004). Similarly, LP-BM5 viral progression was retarded in mice treated with combined anti-CD25, -CTLA-4, and GITR antibodies (Beilharz et al., 2004). These results illustrate the important principle that in ongoing infection, immunity may not be restored simply by removing Tregs, if the resident effector population is anergized or exhausted. Rather, intervention to restimulate effector cells is also required.",

In human retrovirus infection, Treg activity is largely inferred from phenotypic analysis of ex vivo lymphocytes, with reports showing a positive correlation between viral load and FOXP3+ Treg numbers (Andersson et al., 2005, Nilsson et al., 2006, Tsunemi et al., 2005).

Although other authors confirmed the suppressive activity of HCV patient-derived CD4+CD25+ cells, antibodies to these same mediators did not block the suppression of purified CD8+ effectors, suggesting action through a CD4+ intermediary (Boettler et al., 2005, Rushbrook et al., 2005). Significantly, HCV-associated Tregs were able to suppress influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell function (Boettler et al., 2005). Comparison with a cohort recovering from acute HCV infection suggested a decline in CD4+CD25+ regulatory function (Boettler et al., 2005), while longitudinal studies in individual patients more convincingly concluded that spontaneous recovery from HCV infection is associated with the temporal loss of Foxp3+ Treg function (Smyk-Pearson et al., 2008).",

Treg expansion was particularly rapid in mice infected with a hypervirulent strain of Mtb with the emergence of a CD4+CD25+CD223+Foxp3+IL-10+ regulatory T cell population in the lung (Ordway et al., 2007). The expansion of Mtb-specific Tregs was followed in vivo, using an Mtb-specific TCR transgenic mouse, P25; in a RAG-sufficient background, a subset of P25 Mtb-reactive T cells express Foxp3, possibly representing natural Tregs with dual specificity for this pathogen (Shafiani et al., 2010). The Foxp3+ pathogen-specific Tregs proliferated faster than the effector populations in the lung, delayed the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ populations, and caused a significant rise in bacterial titer (Shafiani et al., 2010).",

In this instance, depletion of CD4+ T cells significantly enhanced the formation of a memory CD8+ T cell response following secondary infection or immunization. Anti-CD25 depletion and transfer experiments demonstrated that this suppressive activity was enriched within the CD4+CD25+ T cell population from naive or L. monocytogenes-infected mice (Kursar et al., 2002). Through the use of transgenic mice where all the T cells recognize Ova presented in the context of H-2Ab (OT-II), or where Foxp3 was coupled to a GFP reporter (Foxp3\u2013GFP), it was possible to demonstrate that acute infection with L. monocytogenes expressing OVA was not associated with the induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Fontenot et al., 2005), suggesting that downstream suppression of immunity was more likely via an interaction with CD8+ T cells than a direct antigen-specific regulation of CD4+ T cell function.",

The inability of the host to eradicate H. pylori infection can therefore be linked to Treg suppression of H. pylori-specific effector T cell responses in humans and mice (Lundgren et al., 2003, Raghavan et al., 2003). Accordingly, depletion of CD25+ T cells increased the gastric inflammatory response and reduced bacterial burden in infected mice, but also resulted in development of severe gastritis (Rad et al., 2006, Raghavan et al., 2003), although another laboratory reported no effect of depletion (Kaparakis et al., 2006). Tregs purified from gastric tumors were able to suppress H. pylori-specific effector responses in vitro, suggesting that antigen-specific regulatory T cells might contribute to tumor progression through bystander suppression, as noted above in Friend virus infection (Enarsson et al., 2006).",

A parallel probiotic effect has been found with Bifidobacterium infantis, which increases Foxp3+ Tregs and counters inflammation following Salmonella typhimurium infection (O'Mahony et al., 2008), while Lactobacillus reuteri evokes a similar Foxp3+ Treg expansion and mediates suppression of airway allergy in mice (Karimi et al., 2009).",

            "text": "One of the founding paradigms of T cell immunology emerged from research into infections of mice with Leishmania major, in which the progressive disease in BALB/c mice compared to C57BL/6 is linked to their dominant Th2 response to this parasite (Reiner and Locksley, 1995). C57BL/6 mice resolve infection after several weeks unless their Th1 response is compromised. However, IL-4R-deficient BALB/c are not resistant to all strains of L. major (Noben-Trauth et al., 1999), and other Leishmania species (which cause cutaneous or visceral forms of disease) elicit little immunity in any strain of mouse. In Leishmania tropica, a cutaneous leishmaniasis agent which is equally infective to BALB/c and C57BL/10, only the combined neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 signaling was able to induce immune clearance of parasites (Anderson et al., 2008). The prominence of these two cytokines is repeated in other species, including the cutaneous L. major (Belkaid et al., 2001), and the visceral species Leishmania donovani (Murphy et al., 2001, Rodrigues et al., 1998) and Leishmania infantum (Rodrigues et al., 2009). In the latter, most recent, study, infection was associated with elevated levels of CD4+ Foxp3+ CD103+ Tregs, which contributed toward a high IL-10 profile (Rodrigues et al., 2009).",

In the absence of Tregs, parasites are eliminated but mice also lose their long-term immunity to reinfection (Belkaid et al., 2002). Because parasite persistence and reactivation of infection in humans are major issues, it is relevant to note that high-dose reinfection in mice can expand CD4+CD25+ Tregs thereby allowing latent L. major at a distal site to reactivate (Mendez et al., 2004). By co-transfer of allotype-marked CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells from naive mice into RAG-2\u2212/\u2212 recipients prior to L. major infection, it was also established that the infection only stimulates pre-existing \u201cnatural\u201d Tregs, with little conversion observed from CD4+CD25\u2212 to Foxp3+ Tregs (Suffia et al., 2006); these authors also showed that the Foxp3+ natural Treg population was reactive to L. major antigens, and indeed, they were able to propagate parasite-specific Treg clones that maintained this specificity for months in vi\nt\nro.",

Prenatal exposure to P. falciparum antigens also correlated with greater frequency of CD4+CD25hi or CD25+CD127lo Tregs in newborns\u2019 cord blood, able to suppress malaria antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 production in vitro (Mackroth, 2011, Walther et al., 2009).

            "text": "Murine models of malaria infection reflect a major, but not exclusive, role for Tregs in determining infection outcome. The rodent malaria species Plasmodium yoelii is frequently studied in both susceptible (BALB/c) and resistant (DBA/2) mice. Within 3\u20134 days of infection, the susceptible BALB/c mice raise CD4+CD25+ Treg frequency and overall IL-10 production, suggesting a functional link with their poor protective Th1 response (Wu et al., 2007), and supporting an early finding that anti-CD25 depletion generated protective immunity to this parasite (Hisaeda et al., 2004). However, a subsequent study in C57BL/6 mice compared lethal (Py17XL) and nonlethal (Py17X, NL) strains of P. yoelii and found that both elicited similar, modest, rises in Foxp3+ Treg numbers and that in neither case did CD4+CD25+ cell depletion alter the course of infection (Couper et al., 2008b). In contrast, IL-10 from CD4+CD25\u2212Foxp3\u2212 T cells following P. yoelii infection was the critical factor in impeding parasite clearance and ameliorating liver pathology following infection, with IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice surviving the otherwise lethal Py17XL infection. Nevertheless, a demonstration that Treg activation can suppress immunity to P. yoelii comes from mice co-infected with the helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus (see below, Section 3.4.2); co-infected mice developed more severe malaria infections which were rescued by anti-CD25 antibody treatment (Tetsutani et al., 2009).",

Perhaps counter-intuitively, anti-CD25 Treg depletion protects mice from CM, reducing parasite sequestration and also CD8+ T cell infiltration (Amante et al., 2007, Randall et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2010). Interestingly, the effect of depletion is time dependent (Vigario et al., 2007) suggesting that the action of Tregs could be to facilitate entry of effector cells into the CNS, as described above (see Section 3.1.3) in HSV-2 infections (Lund et al., 2008). An alternative explanation is that key effector populations for CM express CD25 after infection and are co-depleted by antibody treatment. In support of this, Treg ablation in DEREG mice showed a substantial population of CD25+Foxp3\u2212 T cells developing after infection, and no amelioration of CM disease (Haque et al., 2010, Steeg et al., 2009). However, when Treg numbers are experimentally boosted with IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes, mice were fully protected from CM (Haque et al., 2010), arguing again that the action of Tregs depends critically on their proportions and activation state in vivo.",

However, as in P. yoelii, Treg depletion had little effect on overall parasitemias or progression to death from fulminant infections (Wu et al., 2010). Clearly, regulation of the immune response to both human and murine malaria involves multiple cellular components, particularly at the level of tissue infiltration, and is greatly dependent upon dynamic and kinetic factors that have yet to be defined; while Tregs may not be uniquely responsible for susceptibility to infection, clearly it is essential to strike the appropriate balance with effector mechanisms for a health outcome to this potentially devastating infection (Hansen and Schofield, 2010, Scholzen et al., 2010).",

This role of Tregs in limiting pathology, but allowing increased resistance following trypanosome infection, was also demonstrated following T. brucei infection. Treg expansion with the CD28 superagonist resulted in downregulation of inflammatory type 1 cytokines and the development of macrophages into the alternatively activated phenotype (Guilliams et al., 2008). Later studies demonstrated that anti-CD25 antibody treatment and effective depletion of natural Foxp3+ Tregs before T. congolense infection protects BALB/c mice against this normally lethal disease.

In these long-lived infections, many infected patients are asymptomatic but carry large numbers of transmission stages (microfilariae, MF) in the blood (for lymphatic filariasis) or skin (in onchocerciasis). Typically, peripheral blood T cells from these patients fail to respond to parasite antigen challenge in vitro, and are hence termed hyporesponsive (Piessens et al., 1980, Yazdanbakhsh et al., 1993). Treg activity was presaged in this system by Piessens\u2019 report on suppressor T cells in hyporesponsive MF+ patients (Piessens et al., 1982), and by later work showing that the hyporesponsiveness can be reversed, in vitro, with anti-IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 antibodies (King et al., 1993). Most recently, the link between Tregs and the human filarial infection has been firmly established with elevations of both natural and adaptive Treg numbers (Metenou et al., 2010). Moreover, in individuals who are more reactive to parasite infections, with low or zero circulating MF and immunopathological symptoms such as lymphoedema and elephantiasis, Treg activity is deficient (Babu et al., 2009b).",

Hyporesponsive patients show the maximal IgG4 levels alongside depressed IgE responses (Yazdanbakhsh et al., 1993), a relationship which can now be explained by the action of Tregs, as in vitro switching of B cells to the IgG4 isotype is promoted by IL-10 (Satoguina et al., 2005) as well as TGF-\u03b2 and GITR ligation, although not CTLA-4 (Satoguina et al., 2008).

Dead parasites of either stage did not elicit this response, indicating that the presence or products of live filarial worms were responsible for stimulating Tregs.

As such, the model system of Litomosoides sigmodontis (Hoffmann et al., 2000b) has proven exceptionally informative. Very soon after infection, there is expansion of natural Tregs, as determined by BrdU uptake in vivo, followed by a second wave of inducible Tregs (Taylor et al., 2009), with the initial wave at least essential for parasite establishment. Transfer of cells from infected mice protected allergic recipients from allergic airway hypersensitivity, in a manner inhibited by blockade of TGF-\u03b2 or anti-CD25 Treg depletion (Dittrich et al., 2008). One consequence of regulatory expansion is silencing of effector cell responses (an interesting parallel to hyporesponsiveness in humans), and the emergence of a Foxp3\u2212GITR+CTLA4+ unresponsive CD4+ population (Taylor et al., 2005). Most significantly, intervention with depleting antibodies, using anti-CD25 in combination with either anti-GITR (Taylor et al., 2005), or anti-CTLA4 (Taylor et al., 2007) boosted responsiveness and elicited immune killing of worms. These studies were the first to demonstrate that interfering with Treg function (and re-stimulating hyporesponsive effectors through GITR ligation) can reverse susceptibility to a helminth infection.",

In contrast, infection cannot block colitis in mice expressing a T cell-specific kinase-dead TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (Ince et al., 2009), demonstrating that both IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 can be invoked by the regulatory pathways activated by the infection. The importance of TGF-\u03b2 is emphasized, however, both by the finding that H. polygyrus secretes a functional mimic of this cytokine (see Section 4.1 below) and by the successful boosting of immunity to adult worms by in vivo administration of an inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase I (Grainger et al., 2010).",

Like other helminths, they form long-lived, chronic infections which are associated with a degree of parasite-specific immune suppression, deviation (e.g., to IgG4 in humans), and susceptibility to repeated reinfection. As with human filariasis (see Section 3.4.1 above), peripheral T cells from infected patients often fail to respond to parasite antigen challenge in vitro (Grogan et al., 1998), and two reports have charted Treg activity in human schistosomiasis. In Schistosoma mansoni (in which adult worms live in the mesenteric vasculature), CD4+CD25high T cell frequencies were inversely proportional to effector phenotype (CD25midHLA-DR+) cells, but not to parasite intensity; however, curative chemotherapy significantly reduced the frequency of Tregs using these markers (Watanabe et al., 2007). More recently, analysis of the urogenital parasite S. haematobium found a significant positive correlation between CD4dimCD25highCD127lowFoxp3+ T cells and parasite intensity in children at the age at which they are still susceptible to reinfection; interestingly in adults, the reverse was the case (Nausch et al., 2011).",

The infection follows two phases, a Th1-dominated maturation period, during which skin-penetrating cercaria migrate to the lung and then the hepatic portal vasculature; and a later Th2-dominated stage which is provoked by egg release from adult worms (Pearce and MacDonald, 2002). Because eggs become lodged in the liver, this later stage is accompanied by severe granulomatous immunopathology that is moderated by IL-10-producing T cells, both Th2 and Treg, which become numerous at this time (Hesse et al., 2004, McKee and Pearce, 2004). While CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs are not the major contributor of IL-10, they dampen Th2 responses, with anti-CD25 depletion resulting in significantly enhanced IL-4 production (Baumgart et al., 2006). Moreover, anti-CD25 treatment increased egg destruction and aggravated liver pathology around the eggs, demonstrating a beneficial role for Tregs at this stage of the infection (Layland et al., 2007). Subsequent studies confirmed the Foxp3+ phenotype of Tregs surrounding the site of inflammation (Layland et al., 2010), and the interaction was more formally demonstrated by retroviral expression of Foxp3 in mice resulting in the suppression of liver granuloma formation (Singh et al., 2005).",

Interestingly, as observed for L. major infection (Belkaid et al., 2002), the CD4+CD25+ subset was also required to generate normal protective memory responses to infection, establishing a \u201cprotective tolerance\u201d that restrains pathology while allowing a form of commensalism to persist (Montagnoli et al., 2002). Recent work has elucidated a fascinating dynamic in which, when confronted with an acute infection, Tregs promote Th17 responses to C. albicans, while at later time points act to restrain the same effector population from mediating inflammatory bowel disease (Pandiyan et al., 2011); thus early CD25 depletion resulted in diminished Th17 immunity and increased fungal burden, whereas transfer of CD25+ Tregs could prevent colitis in infected RAG mice caused by in vitro polarized Th17 cells.",

In a mouse model, adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ but not CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells from infected mice increased the fungal load in recipients, except in a CCR5\u2212/\u2212 setting (Moreira et al., 2008). Mice lacking CCR5 had a reduced number of Tregs in the lungs, and did not exhibit suppressed T cell proliferation ex vivo following a more contained infection. CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice may have a generalized defect in egress of thymic Tregs, as also demonstrated by their greater resistance to another fungal pathogen, Histoplasma capsulatum (Kroetz and Deepe, 2011). The correlation between Treg activity and extent of fungal infection did not hold, however, in TLR4-deficient mice, which showed higher Foxp3+ Treg numbers and yet were able to control P. brasiliensis infection more efficiently (Loures et al., 2010); whether this reflects an early stimulatory role by Tregs as observed for C. albicans has not yet been tested.",

H. polygyrus adult worm excretory-secretory products (HES), when added to naive Foxp3\u2212 murine T cells together with TCR ligation, induce de novo Foxp3. As this fails to occur in cells expressing the T cell-specific dominant negative TGF-\u03b2-RII, the interaction is directly between HES and the T cells in question. Foxp3+ T cells, whether induced by HES or mammalian TGF-\u03b2, are equally able to suppress airway allergy in recipient mice (Grainger et al., 2010). A similar activity was also found in secreted products of the related sheep parasite Teladorsagia circumcincta, indicating that some helminth parasites have evolved to exploit a key immunosuppressive pathway of their host. The helminth TGF-\u03b2 mimic may be the biological equivalent of viral cytokine-like molecules, such as the EBV IL-10 homolog and other examples summarized elsewhere (Tortorella et al., 2000).",

Hence, TLR2+ Tregs transferred into TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice promote a 100-fold rise in C. albicans infection, which is prevented in the presence of the TLR2 ligand Pam-3-Cys (Sutmuller et al., 2006). It is important to note that later studies indicate that the effects of TLR2 expression on Tregs are largely to promote proliferation independently of APCs (Chen et al., 2009b), and that loss of suppressive activity may be relatively transient (Liu et al., 2006) or circumscribed in effect (Oberg et al., 2010, van Maren et al., 2011). Moreover, other TLR2 ligands can enhance Treg function (Zanin-Zhorov et al., 2006). The apparently contradictory role of TLR2 may be explained by its ability to heterodimerize with different partners (TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10), and the property of some pathogen-derived ligands to selectively stimulate an immunosuppressive, rather than an activating, signal (Depaolo et al., 2008).",

Since induction was intact in both TLR1- and TLR6-deficient hosts, B. fragilis signaling does not appear to be mediated by heterodimers with either of these components, while the TLR2-dependent expression of IL-10 by purified T cells in the absence of APCs argues that the bacterial product acts directly on the T cell without requiring an intermediary population.",

Although natural Tregs will have been selected in the thymus for self-reactivity, this does not preclude them recognizing exogenous ligands through cross-reactivity, mimicry, or dual specificity; conversely, induced Tregs in infection are not necessarily pathogen-specific, but may carry a third-party specificity having been activated as bystanders in a pro-regulatory cytokine environment. Indeed, molecular analysis of TCR usage among natural Tregs argues that they do not have a self-restricted repertoire (Pacholczyk et al., 2007). In any event, specificity is not essential for suppressive function, as once a regulatory cell has been triggered, their production of downregulatory cytokines and ability to tolerize DCs allow them to modify systemic reactions to bystander antigens, whether of pathogenic or nonpathogenic (e.g., allergen) origin.",

De novo induction of Tregs did not occur among Foxp3-negative OVA-transgenic (OT-II) T cells adoptively transferred into mice prior to infection with Ova-expressing L. monocytogenes (Fontenot et al., 2005). In the L. major system, co-transfer of allotype-marked CD25+ and CD25\u2212 T cells demonstrated that Foxp3 expression remained entirely within the CD25+ population, and conversion from naive/effector cells did not occur (Suffia et al., 2006), while in L. sigmodontis infections, BrdU labeling showed early natural Treg proliferation in response to infection (Taylor et al., 2009). However, in H. polygyrus infections, conversion into induced Tregs was demonstrated in Foxp3-negative T cells from a Foxp3\u2013GFPxDO11.10 F1 mouse when transferred to an infected wild-type recipient. When mice were given oral ovalbumin, up to 50% switched on Foxp3 expression (Grainger et al., 2010). This discrepancy may lie in the specific localization of the pathogen following infection in these models, as peripheral induction of Tregs has been shown to occur most efficiently in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Sun et al., 2007). This highly regulated site is populated in the steady state by tolerogenic dendritic cell populations producing high levels of TGF-\u03b2 (Coombes et al., 2007) or by pro-regulatory DCs in helminth infection (Smith et al., 2011).",

In L. sigmodontis infection, prior depletion of existing (thymic and noncognate induced) Tregs (with anti-CD25 antibody) amplified Th2 responses and reduced worm survival (Taylor et al., 2009). Remarkably, the effects of natural Treg depletion were not evident until some 60 days post-infection; this has been attributed to the early rapid proliferation of pre-existing Tregs on infection, which are able then to dominate the course of the ensuing response (Taylor et al., 2009).",

When P25 transgenic T cells (negative for Foxp3\u2013GFP) were transferred to mice prior to infection, there was no conversion to Foxp3 expression despite an overall increase in the endogenous Treg population (Shafiani et al., 2010); hence the predominant Treg type in this infection could be considered natural Tregs. Interestingly, when donor P25 TCR transgenic mice were analyzed in detail, a population of splenic P25+Foxp3+ Tregs was observed, representing \u201cdual specificity\u201d natural Tregs. Purified P25+ Tregs from uninfected mice were then transferred to naive recipients and shown to delay the priming of effector T cells following Mtb infection (Shafiani et al., 2010). Hence, immunity to infection is impaired by Tregs which are both naturally arising and pathogen-specific. In L. major infection, it was previously reported that natural Tregs respond specifically to parasite antigen, as shown by propagation through repeated antigen stimulation (Suffia et al., 2006). As this was a nontransgenic, polyclonal TCR population, this observation implies that the \u201cdual specificity\u201d natural Tregs may be found more extensively than in the case of P25 alone.",

A further report on the remission of disease in MS patients with adventitious intestinal helminthiases (Correale and Farez, 2007) correlated these benefits of infection with enhanced Treg and TGF-\u03b2 levels. These findings, together with an intriguing case report of an ulcerative colitis patient (Broadhurst et al., 2010) and reduced diabetes incidence in filariasis patients (Aravindhan et al., 2010), have heightened interest in helminth therapy of severe immunological dysfunction (Fleming and Fabry, 2007). However, not all trials utilizing this strategy have had positive outcomes (Bager et al., 2010), and it remains to be demonstrated that any beneficial effects in humans of helminth therapy are mediated by Tregs rather than parallel regulatory pathways which are likely to be activated by the same infections.",

Nevertheless, it is clear that Tregs are involved in the outcome of nearly every infectious episode studied, not necessarily in the central role, but invariably modifying the scale and mode of immunity. Moreover, in many cases from viruses to worms, their intervention is pivotal in differentiating healthy from pathogenic outcomes; we can now learn from these examples, and understand the exceptions, to design new strategies for the control of diseases.",

More caution may be required if Tregs shelter the host from pathogenesis or contribute to immunity in nonintuitive ways such as facilitating tissue access for effector cells or maintaining low-level persistent antigen for immunological memory. As fundamental understanding of Treg function deepens, more precise targeting may become feasible, for example, by preventing de novo induction of Tregs in infection, by blocking specific molecular interactions (such as CTLA-4), and by interfering with key molecules required for Treg migration, including CD103, CCR4, and CCR5 (Moreira et al., 2008, Sather et al., 2007).",

If there is global activation of the natural Treg compartment (e.g., as a physiological response to major inflammatory reactions), then Treg targeting is likely to unleash an unacceptable level of immunopathology if not autoimmunity. However, if the key factor in infection is the activity of a selective subset of pathogen-specific Tregs (or a small subset of natural Tregs which also react to a pathogen determinant), these could be ablated in a more restricted fashion.",

Two very interesting perspectives on vaccination emerge from our survey of Tregs in infection. Firstly, the efficacy of vaccines against the major microbial infections is compromised in children harboring common helminth infections, most likely due to the higher level of Tregs in those individuals; hence anthelmintic and/or Treg-reducing interventions may be necessary if current vaccines are to achieve further effects in populations within endemic areas. Secondly, the question is raised of whether vaccines should be fine-tuned to minimize Treg activation. While empirically we have developed adjuvants which stimulate effector immunity, less consideration has been given to whether new vaccines (particularly to parasitic organisms in which vaccines have been notoriously inefficient) should be purged of Treg-stimulating specificities, or even of epitopes which stimulate pathogenic rather than protective effector responses.",

In addition, at a molecular level, there is every expectation that new \u201cdrugs from bugs\u201d will be developed that specifically enhance Treg development and activity, which should prove invaluable in the treatment of noninfectious immunopathologies such as allergy and autoimmunity.",
