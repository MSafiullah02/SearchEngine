The situation here is very critical; patients are being treated in hospital corridors, hospital departments have been converted to treat only COVID-19 patients, many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise, and we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do. Of course, now we know that the intensive care unit (ICU) is one of the most stressed hospital units. However, what is concerning me is that there is not enough attention on the prehospital setting. Primary health care, family doctors, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have key roles to alleviate the burden at the hospital before the admission. Additionally, so many doctors and nurses are working outside of their field of expertise that we are not able to provide the same quality of care as we usually do.",

How do we continue care? Unfortunately, currently there is little known about how long the patients need assistance and for how long they remain COVID-19 positive. We need to plan in advance for home care for the patients, or at least create a new health facility to admit patients that are not able to stay at home alone. And of course, what is concerning me apart from the specific issue of the prehospital setting is the global lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). In Italy, we\u2019re having issues trying to find enough PPE for the family physicians, for the prehospital setting, and the hospital staff. Everyday there is a critical lack of PPE, as well as a misunderstanding of the importance of this issue. These are, in my opinion, my concerns currently.",

            "text": "There are several things that I see as particular concerns right now. PPE is a critical one, not only in the United States where it\u2019s talked about constantly on every major network, but around the world. We talk about Europe and China and the United States ad nauseam, but let\u2019s not forget Africa. Let\u2019s not forget South America. These are places where some of this equipment doesn\u2019t even exist. I saw somewhere today that there\u2019s an African country [Liberia] that has only three ventilators. So, equipment represents a major concern globally, but in particular, PPE is key in the United States where we are rationing it in every hospital. Also, I must emphasize that we are using PPE in a manner that is not consistent with the standard of care. What this means is not that patient treatment is suffering, necessarily, but that provider protection is suffering. I go into work and I put on a mask and I wear it for eight hours. I take it off halfway through, one time, to have an energy drink to keep going. It smells bad after you eat or drink something, and after hours, it becomes hard to breathe through. It makes you very fatigued, and it sometimes makes you breathless to have a conversation with your patient. You can\u2019t understand what anybody is saying in your work area, which has been problematic during critical interventions.",

I get emails daily from people trying to manufacture cloth masks for us. Some are using 3D printers and Girl Scout Troops to make face shields for us. It\u2019s incredible and heartwarming, and is one of the small bits of hope that we have right now as health care providers, especially when there\u2019s so much disappointing and disheartening news. I do not understand how we can assemble all the power and wealth of the United States to go to the moon or to develop the Manhattan Project, yet we haven\u2019t even considered doing the same thing to manufacture PPE and ventilators. There are a lot of people working hard on this pandemic, but I still think that we haven\u2019t pulled out all the stops. The Defense Production Act is a useful tool, but I think if I were in charge, I would be a little less worried about the economy; in the short term, I\u2019d be more worried about immediately cranking out millions of masks from every textile manufacturer in the United States. We need to raise the curve on PPE production while we try to flatten the curve on the spread of this infection. And if we end up with surplus? That\u2019s what makes us great - because then we can share it with other countries.",

I think it was New York University (NYU; New York, USA) hospital whose rationing policy was leaked to the media, raising publicly the potential need for us choosing who gets a ventilator.",

We may be forced to decide which one of three patients needs the last remaining ventilator: a policeman, a mother, or the priest \u2013 how do we decide?

Instead, I find myself simply waiting to hear from Dr. Fauci every day so, that way, I at least hear something I can believe.

There\u2019s a lot of people who are going to die from COVID-19 who are never infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 virus. Instead, they will die as a result of the burden on our health care systems. The implications of delayed ambulances and reduced resources could mean dying of a disease or trauma process that, when in non-pandemic times, they would otherwise have been saved. Heroin overdoses that didn\u2019t get narcan in time; severe pediatric allergic reactions that don\u2019t get epinephrine; trauma in general. All those events may happen, and we\u2019re not including those victims right now in the death rate from this pandemic, but they should be counted.

            "text": "I echo the concerns about the availability of PPE today. I remain concerned about the availability of other material we will need as we move forward in this event. For example, if there is a vaccine that becomes available, or if there are therapeutics that become available, we\u2019re going to need additional needles and syringes - far more than we normally need during the seasonal flu campaign. There are limitations on all products. But, let me go back to the PPE. I agree that the fact that we have limited PPE available for our front-line personnel trying to deal with this problem is just unconscionable. The reason I see behind this dilemma is that the medical supply chain is very fragile, and people don\u2019t really understand that. It\u2019s fragile within all links of the supply chain. What we know about that supply chain is evident for most products, such as chronic disease medications and PPE \u2013 from the point of dispensing all the way back to the manufacturer, there is never more than about 30 days of projected need for the entire market available. It\u2019s a very cost-effective system. I think it\u2019s great when you do that for auto parts, I think it\u2019s great when you do that for other materials that are not essential to protect and save lives. But when we talk about the medical supply chain, we begin to recognize that problem number one is there is no safety stock. There is no back stock. There is no margin for error in that \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of product at any link in the supply chain - all the way from the point-of-care to a distributor or to a manufacturer. That has caused a lot of the problems we have today about getting this vital materiel. Coming out of this on the other side, we\u2019re going to have to really rethink the entire health care supply chain. Do we need to optimize so much for cost or do we need to consider optimizing the costs so that we don\u2019t ever have this kind of a problem in the future? But there are other problems with that supply chain: we are reliant on so many products that are made offshore that are no longer available for manufacturers or have very limited manufacturer availability in the United States. And this is something that many of us have been discussing for years. There\u2019s been Congressional testimony around this problem as well as at the National Academy of Sciences (Washington, DC USA), and many other fora. We\u2019ve got to find a way to get more of this materiel made in the United States. Maybe not all of it, but we\u2019ve got to find a way to protect ourselves better from that supply chain perspective. I think another particular issue of concern goes back to misinformation. There is misinformation and confusion about what the government is doing and not doing, what the Strategic National Stockpile can and can\u2019t do, and a variety of other issues, too. We\u2019ve got to get better about controlling information so that people see the right thing, up first, and credible.",

For the most part, they never studied them in medical or nursing schools. In past decades with lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by large natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. Mine was in 1968 Vietnam with an epidemic of Bubonic plague that not only stopped the war on both sides, it emptied the city and village streets of people for many weeks. While it was the worst plague epidemic of the 20th Century, it was politically kept quiet. Once rare, zoonotic spread (that is between animal reservoirs and human animals) through outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, they have grown because of massive growth in population numbers and density, which are accelerated further by rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change; and for the first time, we have an increasing number of vulnerable populations that are suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. We have never seen those numbers before.",

When we had the first cases here in Novara, we started to prepare and to convert the hospital to assist COVID-19 patients. We were treating the first patients in ICU and expecting the waves, and we had a discussion with colleagues everywhere in the world. For example, from Sweden, we had a long talk with Johan von Schreeb - Karolinska Institutet (Solna, Sweden), and health officers there and according to our suggestions, they prepared in advance. Few days ago, I received a message from Johan saying, \u201cThanks a lot Luca and professor Della Corte to help us in preparing ourselves and to increase the ICU capacity.\u201d And, we had other webinars like this one to help others.

I know that every hospital is different. There\u2019s nothing even remotely one-size-fits-all about this pandemic: there are differences between academic hospitals, non-academic hospitals, and critical access hospitals. But where I work, at George Washington University Hospital, we have a robust disaster medicine program that was in place long before I joined, a faculty team including Anthony McIntyre, Bruno Petinaux, Dan Hanfling, and Joe Barbera - so our hospital is very well-versed in preparing for these crises. I\u2019m able to watch our emergency manager, our local leader, provide great leadership getting our hospital prepared both behind the scenes and in public. I\u2019m able to interact with our nurses and technicians both in the emergency department and the ICU who are all preparing. However, as is being shown in the media, we see courage knowing that many have been told to wear PPE in a way that is not consistent with the standard of care, yet they do not hesitate to go in to treat the most ill of patients. But it is taking toll on us. I received an email a few minutes ago saying that we need coverage for tonight at one of our hospitals because one of my colleagues is now sick with COVID-19 symptoms.",

While currently there\u2019s a lot of criticism that it doesn\u2019t have enough of everything, the Strategic National Stockpile is the most-ready of any global stockpile that we\u2019re aware of. It\u2019s one of the crown jewels in our preparedness system. No, it\u2019s not perfect. But every other country looks at us and asks us what we do and how to create their own. However, admittedly the problem that is facing us right now is that the Strategic National Stockpile has been chronically underfunded for years and we hope we see that improve. I think another particular strength that we\u2019re seeing, and it\u2019s been alluded to before, is the way that people all across the United States, and in other countries as well, are coming together to try to help solve some of these problems. There are limitations to what you can do, but the fact that people are willing to step up and try is a major strength.",

A final strength I see right now is the decision that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA; Washington, DC USA) can respond to biological events. In 2009, when we responded to H1N1, they didn\u2019t have that capability. So I think FEMA leading the National Response Framework and bringing together the whole of government to try to address this problem puts us in a better position than we would have been. Otherwise, we must remember it\u2019s their first experience. There are going to be hiccups and they\u2019re going to be things that we need to go back and look at, as many of us know. As these after-action hot washes go, we\u2019ll beat ourselves to death for several years over it. But I think that this is good.

And I would like to spend a little bit more time on training since it\u2019s my field of expertise. I would say we need more training, more just-in-time training, not only on donning and doffing PPE, so I echo what Skip said: we are lacking of education in training in the medical schools, in the nurses\u2019 schools, at any level. So, right now, we need to act and to improve what we didn\u2019t implement before. We need to increase the knowledge about triage, about ethical dilemmas in this difficult situation. It\u2019s not just about donning and doffing PPE. And also, on basic principles of infection prevention and control. Again, it\u2019s not only because you\u2019re wearing a mask that you\u2019re protected. So, we need to teach everyone. We need to educate health professionals on how to protect themselves and then also on how to react and to respond to difficult situations. For example, again, how to expand the hospital, how to triage patients at the admission, and how to triage patients to decide which one needs ICU, needs intubation, and which one not. I think these are principles that are extremely important right now.",

My father was one of the first firefighters in the building, going straight into the nursery minutes after detonation. Since that time, I knew this is what I was supposed to do as a career. I recall that every night we would come home and there on TV was the excellent Oklahoma City Fire Department Public Information Officer (PIO) named Jon Hanson. Jon was on every single night at the same time telling us what they knew, what they didn\u2019t know, and how they were going to find out. When he was on the air, we all felt that things were going to be okay, because the people in charge were honest and informed. That\u2019s what America needs now.

The first is, we learned a long time ago that you must be first and you must be credible. And I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019ve missed that boat to a certain extent. I think back to 2009 and H1N1. We had a late-night phone call when we were beginning to see these cases and we began to understand what it might mean to the United States. The CDC Director was on camera the next morning, first thing, talking about what we knew, talking credibly about what needed to be our concerns. And we didn\u2019t see that here, and that bothers me. Another issue we need to think about from a crisis leadership perspective is beyond just whether we\u2019re going to send these things out or are we going to award some contracts or whatever. We need to be taking better control at the Federal level of these supply chain problems. I was horrified to hear the comment that states should just go out and try to get their own things, all at the same time the federal government is trying to do the same. We\u2019ve set up a competitive environment between the states and the federal government. There is no room for that kind of competitiveness when we all need to be pulling together to respond to this event nation-wide. I have never been a strong proponent of rapidly running out the door and placing orders under the Defense Production Act because that puts the federal government first in line. But in this particular case, with some of these particular commodities, like PPE, that it is absolutely harming our response. I believe that the government must order under the Defense Production Act \u2013 put itself first in line, bring in other capabilities to bear that are not normally engaged in this production field, and then make those allocations, as difficult as that might be, across the country. Versus having every health care facility in every state and every locality and the federal government all competing with each other for these scarce products. It\u2019s creating an issue across this entire supply chain, including placing equipment that is not needed. As of this writing, supplies are going where it is not needed and not going to where it is desperately needed now. So back to the crisis leadership, whereas I wanted to give you something different, I think this is the most important issue we need to see changing and need to see immediate improvement.
