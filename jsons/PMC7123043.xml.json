For treatment and for optimal effect, therapy should be initiated within 48 h of symptom onset.Infection with hepatitis viruses may be more severe in older adults with more fulminate disease as observed with acute hepatitis A and a more rapid progression to cirrhosis with hepatitis C.Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are common in long-term care facilities, and infection may lead to death due to dehydration and oliguria.The incidence of herpes zoster increases with advancing age and carries with it a significant risk of post herpetic neuralgia. The use of antiviral medications and corticosteroids may reduce the incidence and severity of chronic pain.\n",

Despite lower attack rates, mortality from influenza rises dramatically with age and the presence of underlying medical conditions. The presence of one high-risk medical condition (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurologic, or malignant disease) increases the risk of death from influenza 39-fold. Despite increasing vaccine coverage, current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data indicate increasing influenza-related morbidity and mortality over the past decade (5). In the United States, approximately 226,000 hospitalizations and 34,000 deaths occur each year in persons age 65 years and older (6, 7). The devastating impact of influenza is most dramatically seen in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) where explosive epidemics may occur. During outbreaks, rates of pneumonia and hospitalization are as high as 52% and 29%, respectively, with case fatality rates of 30%.",

For influenza A H3N2 or influenza B, oseltamivir or zanamivir can be used. If the strain of influenza is unknown, currently, zanamivir by itself or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine is appropriate coverage (3). Resistance to zanamivir remains rare. Zanamivir is not recommended for patients with reactive airway disease, because it may exacerbate bronchospasm. Future influenza treatment and prophylaxis recommendations for influenza will need to be guided by close monitoring of CDC reports on influenza resistance patterns. Treatment should begin < 48 h after onset of symptoms (Table 1). In practice, physicians are often faced with the question of whether to treat patients who present outside the 48-h period. At present, only one observational study addresses this question in hospitalized adults (12). In 327 adults hospitalized with influenza, mortality was significantly lower in those who received antiviral treatment as compared to those who did not receive antiviral treatment. Of the 100 patients who were treated, only 29% had symptoms < 48 h.",

When staff was highly vaccinated, several studies have demonstrated a benefit to elderly residents of LTCFs (15). The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2007 relating to the elderly, include vaccination of all persons \u226550 years, vaccination of residents of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities, vaccination of healthcare personnel, and vaccination of healthy household contacts (including children) and caregivers of adults \u226550 years (3).",

In published reports, rates of pneumonia range from 0 to 53% and death from 0 to 55%. RSV appears to cause serious disease in community-dwelling older persons as well. In a 2-year prospective study of elderly persons in the United Kingdom (UK) Nicholson et al., identified RSV in 3% of illnesses using serology for diagnosis (18). With the advent of sensitive molecular testing, a more accurate assessment of the true incidence of RSV has emerged. In a 3-year study from the United Kingdom by Zambon et al., RSV was identified by RT-PCR in 10\u201318% of adults age 65 years and older who were visiting a general practitioner during the winter for a respiratory illness (19). In comparison, during the same period, influenza A was identified in 13\u201342% of subjects. In a prospective study from Rochester, NY, using a combination of viral culture, RT-PCR and serology for diagnosis, RSV infection was documented in 3\u20137% of 608 healthy elderly and 4\u201310% of adults with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions over four winter seasons (16). Serious disease was more common in high-risk patients: 9% visited the Emergency Room, 16% required hospitalization, and 4% died.

Persons with high viral load and viral genotype 1 have a low response rate to \u03b1-interferon, and, many patients who initially respond, relapse when therapy is discontinued (47). Most studies of interferon treatment of HCV have not included older participants. In one study from Japan, interferon was administered to 19 patients aged 65 and older with HCV, and the response rate was 26% compared with 33% in younger persons (57). Of note, the older subjects had higher HCV\u2013RNA titers and more severe fibrosis on their liver biopsy as compared to their younger subjects. Response rates in elderly persons correlated with lower HCV\u2013RNA titers. Because older persons have more side effects and a lower response rate to interferon, treatment should be carefully considered on an individual basis; it should be proposed only in patients up to 75 years who have a significant risk of progression of liver disease, no serious co-morbidities, and an otherwise good life expectancy (54).",

The odds ratio of dying during a hospitalization involving gastroenteritis was 52.6 for adults over the age of 70 as compared with children less than 5 years of age. Residents of nursing facilities are at particular risk for infectious diarrhea illness because of the outbreaks that can occur in closed populations. The majority of nursing facility outbreaks of gastroenteritis are probably viral and include rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, norovirus, Snow Mountain agent, and small round structured viruses (SRSV) (58, 59).",

A typical illness lasts 2\u20133 days and includes voluminous vomiting and watery diarrhea with low-grade fever. Death may result from dehydration progressing to oliguria and acidosis (60, 61). In an analysis of specimens from gastroenteritis outbreaks in aged care facilities in Australia, rotavirus was detected by electron microscopy in 18 of 29 individuals in 7 out of 53 outbreaks (62). Although rotavirus infections are most common in winter, outbreaks can occur at other times of the year (63).",

Most patients report a deep aching or burning sensation, altered sensation to touch with paresthesias, dysesthesia, or hyperesthesia.

The overall incidence is 1.2\u20133.4 per 1,000 person-years, but rates rise sharply with increasing age to 11.8 per 1,00,0 for persons age 65 years and older (67).

Primary infection may occur in childhood when infection is asymptomatic or during adolescence when the symptoms of classic mononucleosis are most often observed (66). Although primary infection is uncommon in old age, the manifestations may be different than those in youth, which makes diagnosis challenging. Seroepidemiologic studies indicate that 3\u201310% of older adults are at risk for primary infection (66). Diagnosis is also often delayed because symptoms may be misleading. Lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and splenomegaly are significantly less common and jaundice is more common in older persons as compared with the young persons (67). Fever is more common and often lasts more than 2 weeks (68, 69). The neurologic manifestations of EBV infection are protean, and acute EBV encephalitis has been described (70). Adding to the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis, development of atypical lymphocytosis may be absent or delayed in the elderly. Diagnosis of primary EBV is made by the presence of heterophile antibodies or EBV-specific IgM. Although acyclovir has in vitro activity against EBV, no benefit has been demonstrated in the treatment of acute EBV infection.",
