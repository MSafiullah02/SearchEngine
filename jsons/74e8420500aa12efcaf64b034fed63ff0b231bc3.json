They presented with features of a viral respiratory illness with complaints of fever, cough, headache and breathlessness.

About 8096 people were affected in 26 countries, with 774 deaths by the end of May 2004, when the epidemic was contained in China. The mortality rate was approximately 9.56%. This epidemic was contained within a few months and later few laboratories related accidental exposures were reported in China and Taipei. A new coronavirus subsequently identified and named as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was the incriminating pathogen responsible for the cluster of influenza like illness and respiratory distress cases in China and other countries like Hong Kong, Vietnam (Hanoi), Singapore, Canada (Toronto) etc. However with good epidemiological surveillance, monitoring of cases and their isolation led to timely containment and it did not become a pandemic. 5 Genetic analysis has shown that the new SARS-CoV (RNA virus) resembles other coronavirues in about 50e60% nucleotide sequences only. It also has a high susceptibility for mutations, may be viable and able to culture after 24 h from various surfaces. 6 Though the exact reservoir of the SARS-CoV is not known, bats have been found to harbor these viruses and transmit them to the human host. 7 It is a highly contagious disease. The symptoms of this disease are influenza like, patients may present with fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, diarrhea and rigors. Fever may not be seen in the elderly population and immunocompromized patients. Later on in second week cough may develop, which may progress to dyspnea or respiratory distress. Such individuals may develop severe acute respiratory distress and may need intensive care and ventilator support. The radiological features on chest X-rays (CXR) and CT scans may be normal in early phase or have focal infiltrates progressing to generalized patchy infiltrates or areas of consolidation.",

The MERS-CoV genomes are phylogenetically classified into two clades; clade A (EMC/2012 & Jordan-N3/2012) and clade B. It has also been researched that these viruses have selective tropism for certain cell receptors (dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4 or CD26) present on nonepithelial bronchial cells and thus evade the innate immune response and antagonize the IFN production in these cells. 11 Human to human transmission is less likely and occurs in close contacts and health care personnel.",

They analyzed the full length genome sequences from various samples from 5 patients, identified early in the epidemic. The genetic sequences of all isolates were identical and they shared 79.6% sequence identity to the SARS-CoV. It was also found that the isolate of the nCoV-2019, from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of one of the patients could be neutralized with the sera obtained from other several patients. 14 A metagenomic RNA sequencing done on the first hospitalized patient from the BAL in mid December 2020 identified the novel coronavirus, with a viral genome of 29,903 nucleotides. This was named as WH human 1 coronavirus or 2019-nCoV by the authors. 15 Other researchers had earlier found that nCoV-2019 utilizes a particular receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II receptor; ACE2) to gain entry into the cells. The authors from the previous study also confirmed this finding. This was extrapolated from the molecular biological study from SARS-CoV experiments in a research laboratory in Hangzhou, China. They analyzed full length of the ACE2 receptor by a cryo-electron microscopic technique and the surface spike (S protein) of the SARS-CoV-2. They concluded that ACE2 is a dimeric assembly; this is docked on by the two S protein trimers and RBD of the S protein. This may facilitate the development of decoy ligands or neutralizing antibodies for the suppression of viral infection. 16 In another remarkable report from Linlin Zhang and his colleagues (published recently in an online edition of Science on March 20, 2020) defined a particular drug target among coronaviruses. This viral protease (M, pro 3CL pro ) is important in processing and translation of viral RNA. An X-ray structure of the non-ligand SARS-CoV-2 and it binding to an a-ketoamide inhibitor was studied. The researchers were able to develop this compound into a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M. pro This inhibitor revealed tropism for lung tissue and could be administered by the inhalational route. 17 ",

The transmission of infection by air-borne route has not been reported as per data of 75,465 cases of the infection in China. 26, 27 Doremalen, Bushmaker and their colleagues conducted in-vitro experiments to study the viability of the virions (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. 28 In this experiment aerosols were generated by using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed in Goldberg drum in a laboratory. It was observed that the SARS-CoV\u00c02 was detected on these surfaces even after 72 h after initial application over these surfaces. The viral titers decreased after 24 h. On plastic surfaces the viruses were viable for 72 h, however the viral load decreased exponentially from 10 3.7 to 10 0.6 TCID 50 . In case of stainless surfaces the viral load decreased from 10 3.6 to 10 0.6 after 48 h. However on copper surfaces no viable SARS-CoV-2 were detected after 4 h and no viable SARS-CoV-1 were measured after 8 h. On cardboard surfaces no viable SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 after 24 and 8 h respectively. In aerosol generating experiments the researchers found the viability of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 in 3 h, though the titers decreased from 10 4.3 to 10 3.5 TCID 50 and 10 3.5 to 10 2.5 TCID 50 per liter respectively.",

This is responsible for the immune amplification. These cytokines and chemokines are responsible for recruitment of lymphocytes and other leukocytes to the site of inflammation. This immune amplification is partly responsible for the tissue damage in the respiratory alveoli, bronchioles, pulmonary interstitial walls etc. The increased expression of the inflammatory mediators has a down regulatory effect on NK cells and CD8 cells, which are important for the lymphocytes to clear the virus. Binding of the Sprotein to various host cell receptors like ACE2 and DPP4R enables the viral RNA to gain entry in the host cell cytoplasm. Various toll like receptors (TLR) like TLR-3, TLR-4 are important to either evade the immune response or recognition of S-protein.
