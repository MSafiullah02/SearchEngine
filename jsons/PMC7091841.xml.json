A total of 46 had an active GvHD (acute grade \u2a7e2 or chronic extensive). According to pre-defined institutional guidelines, all allo-HSCT recipients who presented with respiratory symptoms (such as sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion or dyspnea) with or without fever were investigated for the presence of H1N1 and other community-acquired respiratory viruses (such as adenovirus, metapneumovirus, seasonal influenza A and B, parainfluenza, picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus). All specimens for microbiological confirmation were taken from combined nasopharyngeal and throat swabs at the time of initial screening. In addition, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Serial specimens were collected at the discretion of the treating physician.

Respiratory tract infections were classified according to Ljungman et al.2: upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as detection of H1N1 from upper respiratory secretions together with symptoms from the upper respiratory tract. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined as hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates or new abnormal chest auscultation findings, together with identification of the H1N1 virus in bronchoalveolar lavage or upper respiratory secretions. Hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset >7 days after admission. The immunodeficiency status was graded as published elsewhere,4 either as severe (SID) or MID (moderate). Lymphopenia was defined by lymphocyte counts <1 G/L. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and proportions were compared with a Fisher's exact two-tailed test using SPSS Statistics 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).",

Notably in this study, 31% of patients had ill household contacts.26 Taken together, these observations should alert physicians involved in the care of HSCT patients about the high risk of viral transmission through close contact with children, underlining the importance of education and vaccination of patients and their family households. Close contact with symptomatic children should be avoided whenever possible during periods of RVI epidemics.",

Chronic GvHD and its corollary of long-term immunosuppression has also been associated with the risk of developing RVI and LRTI.1 Recently, Taplitz et al.18 showed that the use of >20 mg of prednisone equivalent daily was significantly associated with the development of LRTI and with 30-day mortality. In our study, 11% (5/46) of patients with active GvHD contracted an H1N1 infection as compared with 2.5% (5/202) of patients without GvHD (P<0.03). Furthermore, 5 of 33 (15%) patients within the first year post transplant had an H1N1 infection, whereas only 5 of 215 (2.3%) patients after the first year were infected (P<0.005). Taken together, these observations suggest that highly immunocompromised allo-HSCT recipients are at risk for severe complications from influenza and deserve close monitoring.",

In healthy adults, a single dose of H1N1 vaccine was highly immunogenic.37 Ljungman22 failed to demonstrate any protective effect from either the seasonal or the H1N1 vaccines in HSCT patients. In contrast, in the Spanish series,14 only one of the vaccinated patients against seasonal influenza was diagnosed with pneumonia compared with 41% who were not vaccinated (P=0.005). Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions as to the protective effect of H1N1 vaccine in HSCT patients, preliminary results from a large study (http://ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT01022905) conducted in our hospital suggest that severely immunocompromised allo-HSCT patients do not respond to H1N1 vaccination. Therefore, influenza vaccination of family members and close contacts, especially children, is strongly recommended to limit the risk of influenza exposure in HSCT recipients. Additional strategies such as post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis for high-risk patients may be warranted.19, 26, 38",
