All radiographs were read prospectively and independently by 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists (R.D. and D.G) and a pediatric radiologist (J.B.-Z.). Radiographic findings were classified as alveolar pneumonia, nonalveolar pneumonia, or no pneumonia.12 Alveolar pneumonia was defined as a dense opacity appearing as a fluffy consolidation of a portion, total lobe, or the entire lung, often containing air on bronchography and sometimes associated with pleural effusion.12 The presence of radiologically diagnosed CAAP was confirmed on agreement of at least one of the study pediatric infectious disease specialists and the study pediatric radiologist.",

The specimens were diluted with 4 mL of RPMI culture medium (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). Three mL of sample was studied for the presence of RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenovirus by direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA), using commercial monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, California), and by tissue culture, as described previously.11 A second DFA was performed after 10 days of culture incubation. Thus, the final virologic results for all viruses (except HMPV) consisted of a combination of DFA applied on the initial sample, cytopathic effect as observed in tissue culture, and DFA applied to tissue culture cells. This combination enhanced our detection by \u223c10% compared with DFA testing of the sample alone (data not shown). Residual aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis for the presence of HMPV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Clinical Virology Laboratory of the Hadassah University Medical Center in Jerusalem. For HMPV detection, RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcL of sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Then 5 \u03bcL of the 60 \u03bcL of purified RNA solution was tested in a one-step real-time RT-PCR reaction, using conserved nucleoprotein gene primers and probe as described previously.13\n",

The univariate analyses used the t-test or one-way ANOVA for quantitative dependent variables and the \u03c72 test or Fisher exact test for categorical dependent variables, as appropriate. Age is a common confounding variable and here was found to be a significant factor in virus distribution as well as in most potential risk factors tested, along with medical history\u2013related and clinical variables.

As reported previously for children with LRTIs in general,4, 6, 11 children with HMPV-associated CAAP were significantly older than those with RSV-associated CAAP. Interestingly, a history of otitis media requiring tympanocentesis was significantly more common in children with HMPV than in those infected with RSV. A history of pneumonia appeared to be more common in children infected with HMPV, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .097). These differences could not be attributed simply to older age, because they remained significant after adjustment for age.",

The predominance of pulmonary obstructive findings is in accordance with the physiological airway hyperresponsiveness induced by HMPV in experimental infection.16 The mechanism of gastrointestinal symptomatology, also more commonly observed in patients with HMPVco, remains unknown. Importantly, children with HMPV were less likely to be hospitalized than children with RSV; however, there was no significant difference in any variable reflecting disease severity, such as respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, or duration of hospitalization. With regard to the extent of inflammatory response, including maximal temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and neutrophil count, children with HMPV did not have unique features compared with children with any other virus tested except adenovirus. It is noteworthy that adenovirus-related CAAP, like virus-negative CAAP, was associated with higher WBC and neutrophil counts compared with other respiratory viruses.",

Whereas RSV accounted for the majority of virus-associated CAAP in children under age 12 months, declining after the first year of life, the proportion of HMPV infections gradually increased with age. In children age 2 to 4 years, the burden of ED evaluation for HMPV-associated CAAP equaled that of RSV-associated CAAP. The significant increase in the proportion of virus-negative specimens after the first year of life suggests an increasing role for other viral agents or pure bacterial etiologies in older children with CAAP. It should be noted that analysis of rhinovirus and coronavirus was not included in the present study. Interestingly, we have also shown that influenza virus, the leading viral etiology of CAAP in adults, played only a minor role in childhood CAAP, detected in only 2.9% of the patients.",

Similar relative sensitivity has been demonstrated recently in a comparison of DFA and real-time PCR for the detection of HMPV.19 Thus, we doubt that the differences seen in this study between HMPV and the other viruses was due to detection bias.",
