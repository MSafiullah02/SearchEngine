As happened with the Spanish Pandemic of 1918, the emergence of previously unknown viruses such as SARS has catalyzed important progress in clinical virology: 1) Development and stringent application of case definitions and infection control measures to limit transmission and eventually contain the spread in disease; 2) International communication and collaboration for the speedy identification and characterization of the implicated infectious agent; 3) Introduction of rapid nucleic acid testing (NAT) of high sensitivity and specificity with a turn\u2010around time of < 24 h for clinical management; and 4) Freely accessible information flow through specific websites on all of these issues.",

This population is also more likely to have young children, causing secondary clusters in kindergarten and schools and hence refueling the pandemic with their higher and prolonged shedding.\u2022Second, early identification and treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors may have significantly attenuated viral replication and cytopathology and hence the clinical presentation, while, with an accelerating spread of the pandemic, delayed and deferred treatment may allow more severe clinical courses. This scenario may particularly apply to countries of the developing world where access to health care and neuraminidase inhibitors is limited, but co\u2010morbidities are abundant.\u2022Third, the current human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of the new influenza A/H1N1 is significantly more efficient compared with SARS and the avian H5N1, and spreads in the northern hemisphere outside of the cold season. Patients suffering from SARS became infectious at the onset of clinical disease; however, influenza cases are highly infectious 1\u20132 days before becoming symptomatic. As the cold season is just starting in the southern hemisphere with the seasonal influenza epidemic, double the number of infections can be anticipated in humans, who will become mixing vessels for new, more pathogenic variants.\u2022Fourth, emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor\u2010resistant variants is looming similar to the influenza season 2007\u20132008 (1).\n",

While this vulnerability naturally applies to small children, transplant patients are similarly at risk for higher and longer virus replication, increased virus\u2010mediated cytopathology, and progression to more extensive inflammation and organ dysfunction. Although the intensity of immunosuppression is a key determinant, the allogenic constellation between the virus\u2010infected cells and the cellular immune effectors contributes to an impaired antiviral immune control. Accordingly, morbidity and mortality of respiratory virus infections is accentuated after lung or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (6). Moreover, longer term consequences of decreased pulmonary function, bronchiolitis obliterans, and related syndromes become more likely.",

The retrospective multicenter study by Liu et al. (8) analyzed risk factors and outcome of respiratory viral infections in 576 pediatric patients within the first year after lung transplantation. In this high\u2010risk population (i.e., being pediatric, immunosuppressed, and lung\u2010transplanted), 101 respiratory virus infections were reported in 79 patients (14%). By mostly non\u2010molecular methods, a wide variety of viruses was detected in the patients showing respiratory symptoms, the most common being ADV (25%), RhV (22%), RSV (21%), and PIV (19%). Importantly, detection of respiratory virus infections was more frequent in younger children and was independently associated with a decreased 1\u2010year survival (8). As stated by the authors, the usage of modern NAT, which was not readily available in the study period from 1998 to 2005, might have increased the diagnostic yield. NAT, especially real\u2010time PCR assays, nowadays plays a central role in virus diagnostics and is increasingly considered as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for the detection of viruses.",

By using PCR assays targeting RSV, FLU\u2010A and \u2010B, PIV\u20101 and \u20103, and hMPV, the authors have obtained 2 times more positive samples than by culture alone, and 4 times more than by direct fluorescent antibody staining. A positive result by conventional diagnostic assays required significantly higher genome viral loads above 5.75 log genome equivalents (gEq)/mL in real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription PCR assays. Although only 34 samples with 6 different viruses were tested (19 PIV, 6 RSV, and 3 FLU), the overall findings of Kuypers et al. (9) support the results of 2 previous studies demonstrating the superior sensitivity of PCR compared with classical methods for 34 RSV and 21 influenza cases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (10, 11). For the influenza cases, the threshold for positive culture results was >5.1 log gEq/mL (11), and for RSV it was >5.3 log gEq/mL (10). In another study of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, PIV and RSV were associated with a significant decline in airflow (12).",
