Of note, the timing of the troponin measurements was different among the studies, and patient severity was also variable. These may explain the different frequencies of myocardial injury between the studies; nonetheless, the overall frequency of 16% depicts an important issue, which should be underscored.",

All these may be precipitated or aggravated by systemic inflammation and the \"cytokine storm\" [1] . Abnormal troponin values, especially if high-sensitivity troponin is employed, have been frequently reported in patients with COVID-19 since the beggining of the pandemic. Among the first 41 Chinese patients with COVID-19, 5 (12%) had acute myocardial injury, and 4/5 needed intensive care support. [4] . Clinical data are key to distinguish the different disease entities, as shown in case reports; for example, Hu et al [12] described the case of a 37-year old male, admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and displayed ST-segment elevation in inferior leads, troponin T > 10.000 ng/L, BNP of 21.025 ng/L, but had no coronary stenoses on the CT angiogram. The echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction, and the final diagnosis was of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Therefore, it should be emphasized that abnormal troponin results may be multifactorial and should be interpreted carefully and in conjunction with other data, due to thir low specificity for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, as Chapman et al [13] suggest, troponin may also be viewed as an ally, if emphasis is placed on its prognostic value (and not on the diagnosis of acute coronary artery disease), and also regarding the epidemiologic issue of recognizing the overall incidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients. Even so, it must be underscored that abnormal troponin levels should not be considered an indication for procedures such as cardiac catheterization, nor for therapeutic measures such as the initiation of antiplatelet agentes.",
