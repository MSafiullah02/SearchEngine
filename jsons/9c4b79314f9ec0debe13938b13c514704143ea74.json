As hemorrhage continues, patients develop hypovolemic shock in addition to tissue injuries that lead to the activation of multiple factors resulting in acute traumatic coagulopathy.

The overwhelming majority of units were collected and produced by blood centers with less than 10 % derived from hospitals. Additionally, 8, 195 ,000 units were produced for further manufacturing. In total, 3,882,000 units were transfused in 2011; a decrease of 13.4 % from 2008. The amount of FFP and FP24 transfused decreased over the 3-year period. However, the utilization of thawed plasma (TP) only became reportable in 2011. 1,181,000 units of TP were transfused, amounting to 30.4 % of all transfused plasma, and mostly being transfused at larger institutions. Finally, only 2000 units of LQP were transfused in 2011. The average cost of a unit of FFP and FP24 were $57.91 and $56.08 respectively [ 9 ] .",

LQP had a superior capacity to form clot and generate thrombin. This phenomenon may be explained either by the presence of platelet microparticles in LQP not present in FFP, FP24, or TP, cold activation of coagulation proteins, the decline in protein S activity, or a combination thereof [ 14 ] . It is known that the freeze-thaw process required for FFP and FP24 degrades proteins; however, it is not understood why certain factors are less tolerant then others. By avoiding the freeze-thaw process the proteins remain functional longer to the point that 15-day-old LQP appears to function as well as 5-day-old TP [ 14 ] .",

            "text": "Currently, the goal of transfusion in the patient requiring massive transfusion is a balanced resuscitation with a ratio of platelets-plasma-red blood cells (RBC) units of 1:1:1 [ 16 -18 ] . Achieving this goal is often diffi cult in environments where a large and rapidly accessible supply of plasma is not available. As described previously, FFP and FP24 require frozen storage and re-warming under very controlled conditions. Furthermore, TP and LQP require storage under refrigerated (4 \u00b0C) conditions. This makes the rapid (within minutes of requirement) administration of plasma diffi cult at most civilian institutions and nearly impossible for military personnel. These factors, along with data indicating improved survival with balanced resuscitation, led to the recent redevelopment of dried human plasma. Lyophilization, a low-pressure, low-temperature, low-humidity process to convert plasma into powder, is not a new concept as it was fi rst developed and introduced into practice during World War II. Lyophilized plasma (LP) was widely used, and became the primary resuscitative fl uid on the battlefi eld by the end of WWII. Nevertheless, the concept was abandoned following unacceptable rates of viral transmission in the survivors, until modern screening methods improved transmission rates significantly [ 2 ] . LP possesses the same viscoelastic coagulation parameters as fresh plasma. In an animal model, Shuja et al. found an insignifi cant decrease in the activity of factors II, VII, and IX [ 19 ] . The French military has utilized dried plasma and has maintained a hemovigilance program since 1994. No adverse effects of infectious transmissions have been reported with the transfusion of more than 1100 units [ 20 ] . In 2011, Martinaud et al. described the utilization of freeze-dried plasma (FDP) in French intensive care units in Afghanistan, while caring for casualties from all the coalition forces [ 21 ] . The process of preparing the FDP involves the centrifugation of plasma. The supernatant is then removed and frozen by slow rotation in an ice slurry. The product is then freeze-dried at \u22128 \u00b0C for 48 h removing much of the CO 2 , resulting in an alkaline product upon rehydration [ 19 ] . FDP was described as easy to use, reconstituting in medical water within 10 min to provide 210 mL of fl uid with hemostatic and volume expansive properties. 236 units have been delivered and evaluated without a single adverse event reported [ 21 ] . Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) also utilizes FDP (from the German Red Cross) as the preferred resuscitation fl uid in the military prehospital setting. Using these dried products facilitates an environment of balanced transfusion from the point of initial resuscitation without playing \"catch-up\" while FFP thaws [ 22 ] .",

However, reaching for packed RBCs fi rst does not accomplish the goal which the trauma community is trying to achieve: restoration of circulating volume. The transfusion of plasma will restore circulating blood volume while delivering coagulation factors to bleeding patients actively consuming coagulation factors. Early administration of plasma, in the prehospital setting, as well as in the emergency center, has been shown to improve acid-base status upon admission, decrease the total transfusion requirement in the fi rst 24 h following admission, and reducing mortality risk [ 25 -27 ] .",

The glycocalyx allows the plasma component of blood to interact with the vessel wall while maintaining a barrier to erythrocytes and leukocytes [ 31 -33 ] . Kozar et al. demonstrated that the endothelial glycocalyx is injured during hemorrhagic shock, manifested by shedding into plasma of syndecan-1, one of the endothelial glycocalyx's proteoglycans [ 36 ] . This had been previously demonstrated in models of ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that the injured glycocalyx is partially repaired with the transfusion of plasma in comparison to the infusion of crystalloid solution [ 36 -38 ] . In their study, significantly less volume was needed in the plasma group to maintain mean arterial pressure. The intact glycocalyx was ablated by hemorrhagic shock and signs of early restoration of the glycocalyx were present in the plasma group in comparison to the crystalloid group. Shown in Fig. 20 .1 are electron microscopy images of mesenteric venules showing the effects of shock and resuscitation on the endothelial glycocalyx along with its thickness. Furthermore, the authors investigated lung injury with respect to hemorrhagic shock based on alveolar thickness, capillary congestion, and cellularity. They found an increase in all three parameters in the shock model compared to sham. However, the infusion of crystalloid increased all three parameters above the model, while the plasma transfusion group had improvement of all three parameters, suggesting attenuation of lung injury [ 36 ] . These fi ndings were also demonstrated by Pati et al.; however, they also demonstrated that the age of Fig. 20.1 Electron microscopy of mesenteric venules stained to reveal endothelial glycocalyx following hemorrhagic insult and resuscitation the plasma transfused also had an effect on this attenuation of lung injury (older plasma being less benefi cial) [ 8 ] . Nevertheless, day 5 plasma stored at 4 \u00b0C remained superior to crystalloid infusion with respect to reparative capacity in the animal model [ 8 ] . This indicates that a component of plasma, in soluble form, interacts with the endothelial membrane to restore the endothelial glycocalyx. Figure 20 .2 shows the vascular injury caused by hemorrhagic shock through hypoxia leading to cell contraction and decreased vascular permeability. Resuscitation with plasma decreases the infl ammatory response, promotes endothelial repair, and leads to normalization of the endothelium. This leads to a decrease in vascular permeability; clinically seen as less edema.",

Initiating plasma transfusion early also led to a decrease in the total amount of RBCs transfused during the initial 24 h following admission [ 50 ] . PROMMTT clearly showed that earlier plasma was associated with improved survival; however, few patients received consistent ratios. There was signifi cant concern that higher ratios would lead to increased hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) . However, Robinson et al. showed that hypoxia was associated with excessive crystalloid infusion rather than plasma [ 51 ] .

The PROPPR study was the fi rst multicenter randomized trial comparing transfusion strategies with mortality as the primary endpoint. It provided evidence for the commonly held belief that balanced transfusion protocols were benefi cial to severely injured patients with hemorrhagic shock. Although no signifi cant differences in 24-h and 30-day mortality were found between the two transfusion ratios investigated (plasma-platelet-RBC ratio of 1:1:1 versus 1:1:2), the early availability of blood products transfused within minutes of arrival in a balanced (1:1:1) ratio achieved hemostasis more often and decreased hemorrhage-related deaths within the fi rst 24 h following admission [ 18 ] . Furthermore, while the balanced transfusion group received signifi cantly more plasma and platelets within the fi rst 24 h, no difference was found in the rate of 23 prespecifi ed complications including the systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS), ARDS, transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), TRALI, and allergic reactions. Consistent with the biology of bleeding patients, the median time to hemorrhagic death in PROPPR was 2.3 h.

In the prehospital setting the emphasis centers on the cessation of bleeding. This occurs in parallel with hypotensive resuscitation utilizing liquid plasma and packed red blood cells. LQP and packed RBCs are utilized by our hospital-based helicopter program, Life Flight. Patients are identifi ed as requiring a prehospital transfusion based upon the assessment of blood consumption (ABC) score. Over a 20-month study period, 942 units (244 RBCs and 698 plasma units) were placed on the Life Flight helicopters with a 1.9 % waste rate [ 26 ] . Once a severely injured patient reaches the trauma center, a rapid thromboelastograph (r-TEG), venous blood gas, and hemoglobin levels are drawn and immediately analyzed. In patients that have an ABC score <2 (1 point each for penetrating mechanism, systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, heart rate >120 beats/min, and a positive focused abdominal assessment with sonography for trauma) or without substantial bleeding (<3 units/h), the r-TEG is used to guide blood product resuscitation [ 52 ] . Patients that are in shock, are hypotensive, or have an ABC score \u2265 2 are started on the massive transfusion protocol and receive 1:1:1 ratio-driven resuscitation [ 53 ] . The patient then either proceeds to the operating room or interventional radiology. The response to resuscitation is closely monitored. Once clinical bleeding has slowed considerably or ceased the resuscitation is converted to goaldriven resuscitation utilizing r-TEG [ 53 ] .",

This range with multiple reports is secondary to the diffi culty in determining the etiology of pulmonary edema as diagnostic evaluations for TACO are invasive and serologic tests for TRALI have yet to be validated. In Fig. 20 .4 , Gajic et al. designed an algorithm to determine the etiology of post-transfusion acute pulmonary edema [ 64 ] . The algorithm is based on the European-American ARDS Consensus Conference defi nitions of TRALI and integrates specifi c laboratory values into the decision-making process. Frequently, TACO is a post-hoc diagnosis made once a patient responds to a specifi c therapy [ 55 ] .",
