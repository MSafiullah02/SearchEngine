The disease, initially called novel coronavirus disease, was later renamed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) [1, 2]. Due to the rapid spread of the virus across the globe, and subsequently escalating number of confirmed cases and deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 [3]. On a global scale, the mortality and morbidity counts of the disease are rapidly changing; as of April 12, 2020, there were over 1.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths globally [4].",

Although COVID-19 cases and mortality soared in many countries, no further cases were reported in Nepal until the second week of March 2020. As of April 12, 2020, 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Nepal (including the case reported in January, which has already recovered) [9]. Of these, 11 cases were travel-related or imported, and only one was community transmitted. Considering the imminent threat of COVID-19 spread in Nepal, the government of Nepal has initiated several preventive measures. These include designation of medical hubs across the country and a \u201cDedicated Isolation Hospital\u201d in the capital city of Kathmandu to treat the COVID-19 cases. All international flights were suspended, and a health-desk is established at the Tribhuvan International Airport [10]; checkpoints were established in the border with India. Further, a country-wide lockdown came into effect from March 24, 2020, where people were asked to stay at home except for emergency reasons. Given that the outbreak has been deemed unmanageable even in countries with developed health infrastructures like the US and Italy, global health experts have pointed out that the situation may be dire in less developed economies like Nepal, which already has health resource constrains. Hence controlling the viral spread at the initial stage of the outbreak is paramount in Nepal, and the general public is an important collaborator in this effort.",

For the public to be a responsible partner in the efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus, they should be aware of the outbreak and informed of their role in controlling the spread. Misinformation, misunderstanding, and lack of awareness among people can lead to non-compliance to basic sanitation and disobedience of national guidelines, which may facilitate the rapid transmission of infection in the community. Therefore, for the effective implementation of preventive measures, it is important to examine the level of knowledge and perception of the universal safety precaution among the Nepalese population during this global health crisis. However, to the best of our knowledge, so far, no prior study has assessed the knowledge and perception related to universal safety precautions of COVID-19 among the Nepali population.",

The questionnaire was developed in Google forms (https://www.google.com/forms/about/) [14]. A team of 30 researchers from two public health colleges in Nepal, Central Institute of Science and Technology (CIST) and Asian College for Advance Studies, reviewed the contents of the tool and helped in finalization. Call for participation, and subsequently, the survey link was made available publicly on the web page of the Asian College for Advance Studies affiliated to Purbanchal University. To maximize public outreach, the survey was promoted in different social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The survey took approximately 10 min to complete.

Further, they also agreed that coronavirus spreads from humans to humans, mainly through respiratory droplets, and avoiding handshaking and touching eyes, nose, and mouth would prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, misperception was prevalent in certain areas such as more than half of the participants perceived (either agreed or weren\u2019t sure) that the virus could also transmit by fecal-oral route and consumptions of meat and poultry could increase the spread. Although a lesser, yet still a sizable, proportion (10\u201320%) of participants perceived that COVID-19 attacked only older people, and there was no survival following the infection. About 18% disagreed or weren\u2019t sure that coughing into elbow was a good practice to prevent the spread.",
