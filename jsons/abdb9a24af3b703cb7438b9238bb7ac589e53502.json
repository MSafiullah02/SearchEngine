The mother reports that the child had a difficult time sleeping the previous night because of the harsh cough. On examination, the boy is playful and smiling with a temperature of 99\u00b0F. It is noticed that he has a seal-like barking cough and subtle evidence of audible stridor. His chest is clear on auscultation with a normal respiratory rate. No chest wall recession is noted. The rest of the exam is unremarkable. The patient is sent home with a suspected upper respiratory infection. Later that evening, the family practitioner receives a phone call from the emergency department informing him that the patient has had worsening respiratory difficulty with visible signs of inspiratory stridor and is being admitted to the hospital for further observation.",

Because of the relative rarity of adult croup, it has not been extensively studied and cases of the entity have only been examined retrospectively. The adult form of croup is also caused by various viral and bacterial pathogens as well as a fungal cause. The viral causes of adult croup include herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and influenza type B. The bacterial causes include S. aureus and H. influenzae. The fungal cause of adult croup is Aspergillus. Table 1 highlights the more common causes of croup in children and adults.

In addition to the viral causes of croup, the differential diagnosis includes the bacterial pathogens causing tracheitis. One of the most important, and often overlooked, causes of a croup-like presentation in children is foreign body aspiration. In contrast to croup, foreign body aspiration would not present with a seal-like barking cough and a history of aspiration or choking can be obtained in 90% of cases (5) . Table 2 lists some other disease entities causing stridor in children. Epiglottitis used to be a major cause of stridor in children. However, with the use of the H. influenzae vaccine, this entity is much less common. It can be distinguished from croup by a sudden onset, high fever, inflammation of the supraglottic region, dysphagia, lack of cough, and a thumb sign on radiography. Another common cause of stridor in children is a peritonsillar abscess. In contrast to croup, the child with a peritonsillar abscess will often have difficulty opening the mouth and visualization of the tonsils will reveal erythema, swelling, and tonsillar exudates.",

The virus enters through the nose and begins replication in the nasopharyngeal respiratory epithelium causing coryza as the first symptom. The infection spreads distally causing laryngeal and tracheal erythema and edema with diffuse inflammation of the airway walls. Because of this inflammation, the airways secrete a fibrinous exudate causing partial obstruction of the tracheal lumen. The infection also involves the vocal cords and subglottic larynx. Inflammation of the vocal cords causes vocal cord immobility and hoarseness. In the subglottic region where the airway lumen is the narrowest because of a ring of cartilage surrounding the area, a small amount of edema restricts airflow leading to audible inspiratory stridor and the seal-like barking cough. In younger children, the infection and inflammation can cause significant airway obstruction as a result of the smaller circumference of the lumen. This can result in mild to severe hypoxemia.",

This variant is often triggered by allergy and occurs at night with noninflammatory edema of the airway structures and possible spasm of the glottis resulting in stridor and the seal-like barking cough owing to the same mechanisms described previously. This variant of croup is short-lived and responds well to humidify air with recurrence of symptoms limited to the first few days after the initial episode.

These findings are found in only 50% of the cases of croup with many children having radiologic plain films with normal findings (4).

The initial therapeutic approach to a child with suspected croup is general evaluation of the degree of respiratory distress and maintenance of an adequate airway for effective oxygenation and ventilation. This can be accomplished by monitoring the heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. In the setting of severe respiratiory distress and hypoxia, it may be necessary to provide 100% oxygen via a bag-valve-mask device. If this is unsuccessful and the child's oxygenation does not improve, it may be necessary to maintain an airway with endotracheal intubation. Any patient requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygenation should be admitted and monitored as an inpatient. This determination is made more accurately by observing the clinical picture and degree of distress and stridor rather than by pulse oximetry alone. Most children do not present with severe stridor and respiratory distress and do not require either technique to maintain an adequate airway. These children can typically be managed on an outpatient basis. It is important to avoid stressful situations in the treatment of children with croup because agitation and crying can aggravate the symptoms and worsen the respiratory distress. Another important initial aspect in the treatment of a child with croup is the evaluation of volume status. A child should be provided oral rehydration if tolerated, but it may be necessary to administer intravenous fluids if oral intake is not adequate.",

Epinephrine acts to stimulate the \u03b1-adrenergic receptors causing capillary constriction and reduction of laryngeal mucous. This allows for a larger airway diameter and reduces respiratory difficulty and inspiratory stridor. The effects of epinephrine are short-lived, lasting for 2 hours. Patients should not be discharged for at least 3 to 4 hours after the administration of epinephrine, given the possibility of return of symptoms after the effects of the therapy have worn off. The use of epinephrine in the treatment of croup should be reserved for those patients who are seriously ill or have had a poor response to other treatment modalities, including mist therapy and analgesics.",
