The COVID-19 has spread rapidly, as it took only 30 days to expand from Wuhan, Hubei Province to the rest of the area of Mainland China. The epidemic curve of onset of new cases in China peaked on January 24-26, 2020 and began to decline after February 11, 2020. 1 By March 24, 2020, a total of 81,747 confirmed cases had been reported in China, with more than 370,000 confirmed cases, including over 16,000 deaths, had been reported in 190 countries, areas, or territories all over the world. 2 This pandemic has received widespread attention from the international community and has become a major public health priority that requires the collective efforts of people all around the world. Among the health care practitioners working against the COVID-19 pandemic, anesthesiologists are in a strategic position to assist their hospitals from a patient care perspective and through various leadership roles.",

The disease causes respiratory illness with symptoms including cough, fever, and, in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. Although most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment, COVID-19 can be serious and even fatal. Older people and people with coexisting medical conditions could be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill. The outbreak of COVID-19 could be particularly risky for health care workers because of their ongoing professional exposure to the virus. At present, health care practitioners are the most valuable resource for every country to combat the disease, and we believe that health care workers need to be well protected first, especially anesthesiologists who play a vital role in emergency airway management, intensive care, and perioperative medicine. Here, we review the different stages of COVID-19 development in China, focusing on the personal protection of health care workers and the risk factors related to their infection.",

At this time, the infection rate ranged from 3.5% to 29% among health care workers in different hospitals in the epicenter of Wuhan according to previous reports, 6,7 when the initial source of the novel coronavirus still remained unknown. However, more and more evidence supported that the virus spread from human to human and also across generations of cases. 3 Accordingly, WHO assessed the risk of this event to be very high in China. 5 On January 23, 2020, the central government of China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei province thereafter, in an effort to quarantine the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak and to stop the virus from spreading further across the nation. This took place a week before WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 8 At this stage, the general population had lack awareness of the disease, with barely any personal protection, when the number of patients was increasing sharply, leading to the frequent infection of health care workers.",
