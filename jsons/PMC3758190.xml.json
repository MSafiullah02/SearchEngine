            "text": "Much of the reconstruction of retroviral lineages has centred on the well-conserved reverse transcriptase (RT) motif of the polymerase gene (pol) [1\u20135]. Its high level of sequence conservation facilitates the design of primers that cast a wide net, amplifying RT sequences from a wide range of vertebrates [6\u20139]. Additionally, conserved motifs allow easy alignment of even distantly related proteins, demonstrating, for example, the common ancestry of retroviruses and the many RT-containing elements found among various kingdoms of life [10]. Early RT-based analyses revealed the surprising fact that proviruses representing retroviruses estimated to have infected their hosts tens of millions of years ago or more harbour recognizable features of extant retroviruses, despite their notoriously high substitution rate [11\u201313]. While this situation leads evolutionists to ponder the \u2018molecular clock\u2019 conundrum [14], the fidelity of features over deep evolutionary time also gives us a set of data that can be analysed using phylogenetic methods, revealing evolutionary dynamics of retrovirus\u2013host interactions.",

Phylogenetic trees combining RT sequences from both endogenous and exogenous retroviruses suggest that all known retroviruses can be grouped into three broad classes [4,15]: class I consists of gammaretroviruses, epsilonretroviruses and the ERVs that cluster along with them. Class II comprises the beta- and alpharetroviruses, and the lentiviruses, along with related ERVs. While no endogenous deltaretrovirus-like element has yet been discovered, an argument to include deltaretroviruses under the class II umbrella can be made based upon the catalytic site (YMDD) in RT, which matches that of the other class II members. Class III ERVs cluster with spumaretroviruses [16]\u2014an ancient group of retroviruses that have largely co-speciated with their hosts [17].",

Additionally, just as organismal chromosomes can have complex independent histories, recombination uncouples the evolutionary history of different parts of the retroviral genome [18]; consequently, RT sequences reflect only one portion of the historical lineage giving rise to any given retrovirus genome. In this review, we explore some interesting details that analysis of endogenous retroviral env genes can provide, beyond those provided by the pol gene. When we allow env to tell its own story, new insights into retroviral evolution emerge, involving evidence and likelihood of cross-species transmissions, the evolution of new lineages and possibly genera, and even recombination between virus families that could generate new types of viruses.",

The fusion subunit of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) of most orthoretroviruses are class I viral fusion proteins (not to be confused with class I retroviruses) sharing structural and mechanistic features with filo-, paramyxo-, orthomyxo- and coronaviruses [20]. (Epsilonviruses are the exception\u2014Env proteins representing this genus have not been characterized, but sequence analysis predicts a distinct structure. For these reasons, they will be omitted from this review.) Retroviral Env is synthesized as a polyprotein precursor that trimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and is cleaved by a host protease in the late Golgi apparatus. The result is a trimer of heterodimers, each consisting of two subunits\u2014SU, for surface domain, and TM, for transmembrane domain\u2014that either remain associated non-covalently, as in the case of betaretroviruses and lentiviruses, or by virtue of a single intersubunit disulfide bond, as found in gamma-, delta- and alpharetroviruses, and the subset of betaretroviruses formerly known as type D [21\u201326]. The Env trimers, anchored into the cellular membrane via the TM subunit, then traffic to the plasma membrane and stud the surface of the newly budding virus particles [27].",

The cleavage site between SU and TM consists of a polybasic motif (K/R\u2013X\u2013K/R\u2013R) [29] and marks the beginning of the TM portion of the sequence. The TM sequence has two hydrophobic stretches that flank an ectodomain (the portion of TM exposed on the outside of the virion). The first hydrophobic stretch, at or near the N-terminus, constitutes the fusion peptide (fp), and the second is the transmembrane region (tm), by which TM is anchored into the viral membrane. Prominent features of the ectodomain include two heptad repeat regions (hr1 and hr2) flanking a stretch of residues that contains either two or three cysteines. The heptad repeats play a critical role in the dynamic rearrangement of the trimer during the process of fusion, and formation of the highly conserved coiled-coil structure that is found among many viral fusion proteins [30]. The ectodomain sequence of some retroviruses also includes a region known as the immunosuppressive domain (ISD)\u2014a stretch of 20 amino acids immediately upstream of the first cysteine residue, recognizable by its conserved residues [16]. Finally, C-terminal to the transmembrane region is the cytoplasmic tail (CT), which is located on the cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane and after assembly, on the interior side of the viral membrane. The CT can be highly variable both in length and sequence, even among retroviruses of the same genus.\n",

Some functions that have been associated with the CT include modulation of fusogenicity [38], interaction with cell signalling pathways [39,40], and possibly incorporation of Env in virus particles [41]. The membrane proximal external region (MPER) is a stretch of 30 residues immediately upstream of the transmembrane region that, in HIV-1, is thought to be important for Env incorporation into virions, as well as membrane disruption during fusion [42\u201344]. The cysteine pair in the ectodomain is highly conserved across the orthoretroviral TM (except in epsilonviruses). The cysteines are covalently bonded via a disulfide link, forming a loop within the TM ectodomain that is involved in interaction with SU. Studies have shown that elimination of the loop abrogates fusion [45].",

The gamma-type is representative of gammaretroviruses, deltaretroviruses and the recombinant betaretroviruses (those formerly known as type-D retroviruses); the avian gamma-type is a variant of the gamma-type that is, so far, found only among alpharetroviruses. Because the SU and TM subunits of these retroviruses are linked by a disulfide bond, a third cysteine is required (in addition to the pair that form the highly conserved intramolecular loop in the TM ectodomain) to participate in a disulfide bond formed with SU [21,25,47\u201349]. In both the gamma-type and the avian gamma-type TM, the three cysteines are found in a rigidly conserved CX6CC motif, immediately downstream of the ISD sequence [16]. The avian gamma-type differs from the gamma-type in that an internal fusion peptide is located approximately nine amino acids downstream of the cleavage site rather than at the N-terminus. Additionally, in the avian form, the fusion peptide is flanked by a pair of cysteines that form a disulfide bond with one another [50].",

How is the beta-type, with its two-cysteine motif, related to the gamma-type, with its three-cysteine motif? Did one arise from the other, losing or gaining a cysteine, for example? The shared domain organization and common features allow us to construct reasonable alignments of gamma- and beta-types. However, it is important to note that, at the sequence level, these two types are so highly diverged that basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [51] searches with the gamma-type TM sequence do not return any beta-type TM sequences and vice versa, despite the use of various parameters and datasets. Such divergence applies even when the ISD region is removed from the analysis [16], or when cysteines in the ectodomain have been mutated [26]. In fact, the genetic distance between the gamma-type and beta-type TM is great enough that it allows for the possibility that they were acquired from independent sources, and that their shared features are due to convergent evolution rather due to than common ancestry. This situation has implications for phylogenetic analyses, as alignments of non-homologous sequences will not reveal valid evolutionary relationships.",

The betaretroviral genus is split between the type-B members, which carry the beta-type TM, and the type-D members, carrying the gamma-type TM.

These viruses appear to be descendants of a virus that infected the primate lineage before the divergence of Old World and New World primates, roughly 50 Ma [61]. The viral progenitor was the product of a recombination event involving class I and class II viruses, by which a betaretrovirus (class II) acquired a gammaretroviral env (class I) from an unknown source, then diverged, giving rise to the lineage that includes LNGV and MPMV along the Old World lineage, and SMRV along the New World lineage [61]. Later, a type-D env (thus, a gamma-type env, even though its donor would be classified as a betaretrovirus) was acquired by a gammaretrovirus known as Papio cynocephalus ERV (PcEV), producing baboon endogenous retrovirus (BaEV) [60]. Thus, a gamma-type env passed from a class I to a class II retrovirus, then back to class I again. The chain also extends further in the other direction: the env of BaEV recombined with gag-pol of Felis catus endogenous virus (FcEV) to produce RD114\u2014an infectious ERV of cats [62].\n",

Such an event may have occurred in the case of python molurus ERV (PyERV), which has been found in the genomes of two species of pythons [67]. The gag-pol region of PyERV clusters with class II ERVs and aligns most closely with betaretroviruses, whereas the env is typical of a murine gammaretrovirus.

Among alpharetroviruses and the murine gammaretroviruses, a pattern is seen in SU amino acid sequences wherein a few discrete variable regions are flanked by regions of relatively high conservation [71,72]. In many cases, such as with ALV-A and -B variants, the two variants have only a few amino acid changes in the variable region, yet bind cognate receptors that are quite different from one another in sequence and structure [73]. This situation suggests a strategy in which mutational space can be explored via a small variable region within the context of a well-conserved structure. Similarly, within the variants of MLV (i.e. ecotropic, amphotropic, xenotropic), SU has discrete variable regions near the N-terminus, where the RBD is found, with a rather highly conserved (64% identity at the amino acid level) C-terminal portion consisting of a proline-rich region (PRR) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) [74].

How does the divergence profile of the gamma-type relate to its success across multiple vertebrate classes? And what prevents the beta-type from branching out of the mammalian class, despite enjoying wide-ranging success within its limits? Do the differing mechanisms of subunit association impact each type's ability to adapt? In the gamma-type env, the subunits are joined via a single covalent bond involving a specific motif in TM\u2014the CX6CC region\u2014to a cysteine in the CTD of SU. One could speculate that this configuration is key in allowing the remainder of SU to evolve a highly effective modular organization, whereby a variable RBD is positioned at the N-terminus, followed by a PRR that may serve as a flexible arm [73]. Under this model, the structure would afford the RBD a freedom of movement that increases its efficiency in exploring interactions with novel receptors. By contrast, in the beta-type env of HIV-1, weak interactions between SU and TM occur over multiple residues at both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of SU [23]\u2014a configuration that may limit the flexibility with which the beta-type env can explore mutational space.",

            "text": "In conclusion, one chapter of the story that env tells through the fossil record goes something like this: when a betaretrovirus acquires a gamma-type env, regardless of the selective pressure that drives the recombination event, it acquires the chance of accessing a new niche, with new selective pressures on the entire virus. In the process of adapting to the new host, the virus will diverge from its recombinant progenitor, probably all the more so in cases involving cross-species jumps between vertebrate classes. Although such events appear to be rare [75], they can have significant impact\u2014generating new viral lineages, and even new genera. In this context, the differences between gamma-type and beta-type env described here suggest that the broad division between class I and class II ERVs based on RT sequences represents divergence that was driven by association with two very different env types\u2014class I with the gamma-type env, and class II with the beta-type env. These two env types developed different dynamics as they followed different paths, with the gamma-type acquiring modularity that may have contributed to its wide host range, and the beta-type limited to mammals. The propensity for recombination shown by the gamma-type, in conjunction with its wider host range, may have begun driving recombination towards replacement of the beta-type env with gamma-type env, with these events seeding new genera among class II viruses\u2014the deltaretroviruses, the alpharetroviruses and the type-D betaretroviruses.",
