Preliminary clinical studies using vaccines prepared from autologous tumor cells have reported significant retardation of disease progression in colorectal cancer patients (Hoover et al., 1985) , and a reduced rate of recurrence of chemically-induced rat colon carcinomas (Ross et al., 1984) . A syngeneic system is particularly useful for immunotherapeutic maneuvers of this kind and also for the routine lines have been reported to metastasize in syngeneic hosts (Tsuruo et al., 1983; Thombre et al., 1984) . However, one of these lines, P26, is apparently not of epithelial origin (Tsuruo et al., 1983) , and the other requires technically demanding intracecal administration to generate liver metastases, a procedure that does not lend itself readily to screening programs which require a large volume throughput of test materials. Thus there is a clear need for a well-characterized syngeneic model of colon carcinoma metastasis.",

Preliminary clinical studies using vaccines prepared from autologous tumor cells have reported significant retardation of disease progression in colorectal cancer patients (Hoover et al., 1985) , and a reduced rate of recurrence of chemically-induced rat colon carcinomas (Ross et al., 1984) . A syngeneic system is particularly useful for immunotherapeutic maneuvers of this kind and also for the routine lines have been reported to metastasize in syngeneic hosts (Tsuruo et al., 1983; Thombre et al., 1984) . However, one of these lines, P26, is apparently not of epithelial origin (Tsuruo et al., 1983) , and the other requires technically demanding intracecal administration to generate liver metastases, a procedure that does not lend itself readily to screening programs which require a large volume throughput of test materials. Thus there is a clear need for a well-characterized syngeneic model of colon carcinoma metastasis.",

To mimic the human disease in any reasonable manner, a tumor model must, at least, use colon-derived epithelial cells with defined and reproducible metastatic properties. Although an extensive panel of cell lines have now been derived from human colon carcinoma, their metastatic capacities in nude mice are extremely poor. Furthermore, in vivo studies using human tumor xenografts are of necessity limited to immunosuppressed hosts. For many experimental purposes this may be acceptable. However, in attempting to devise models that can be used to evaluate biological response modifiers for their potential in augmenting host responses to tumors, this is a serious disadvantage. Recent clinical studies suggesting that immunotherapy of colorectal cancer patients may produce significant improvements in short-term prognosis (Hoover et al., 1985) reinforce the need for tumor models for metastatic colon carcinoma in immunocompetent hosts to enable optimum conditions for immunoenhancement to be defined.",

The ability of K12/TR cells to form domes and junctional complexes illustrates the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity needed for vectorial fluid transport.

The incidence of lymph-node metastases was influenced by the site of primary tumor and by the host speciedstrain. Dissemination to proximal nodes from an S.C. tumor in the flank was seen in nude rats and at a lower frequency in nude mice. Metastases to contralateral lymph nodes were not observed in nude mice and were present in only one nude rat. Presumably, fewer cells reach the more distal contralateral node and, as observed in other tumors, the incidence of metastases may be determined by a balance between the number of cells reaching the node and the ability of host defenses to eliminate them (Carr, 1983) . The K12/TR cell line is known to be immunogenic and its growth in syngeneic animals can be prevented by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from animals injected with a related cell line, K12/TS (Caignard et al., 1985) . It is thus possible that functional elements of the immune system (Gorelik et al., 1982) may limit growth of Kl2/TR cells in the lymph nodes of nude rats and mice. KlYTR cells were capable of colonizing the lungs of nude mice when introduced directly into the circulation. The time required for the cells to induce morbidity via this route was inversely related to the cell dose. In addition to the similar patterns of metastasis seen in the various host animals in the present study, the parental DHD/K.TR cell line from which K12/TR was derived was shown previously to metastasize to the lungs and lymph nodes of syngeneic BD-1X rats (Martin et al., 1983) . Thus, this cell lineage appears to exhibit reproducible metastatic properties in the syngeneic host.",

Tumors induced by subcutaneous injection of K12/TR cells failed to form detectable liver metastases. However, liver colonies were observed following intrasplenic injection of KlUTR cells in nude mice, but their pathogenesis is ambiguous because the cells form massive tumors at the site of incision. Thus, it is not known whether the liver colonies arise directly from the spleen tumors and/or from those at the incision site. No liver colonies were seen in nude mice following i.p. injection of K12/TR cells, except in areas of the liver in direct contact with diaphragm tumor deposits. These colonies were restricted to the surface of the liver as opposed to the parenchymal replacement seen following intrasplenic administration of cells. Thus it is likely that dissemination from the spleen to the liver occurs via the circulation rather than by seeding of the peritoneal cavity. Nonetheless, as reported previously (Kozlowski et al., 1984; Lafreniere et al., 1986) , intrasplenic injection of tumor cells in nude mice appears to be a useful means of producing liver tumors for testing therapeutic or diagnostic modalities. Formation of gross or microscopic lung metastases following intrasplenic injection of K12/TR cells was only seen in nude rats. Nude mice and BD-1X rats injected via the intrasplenic route may also have developed lung metastases, but the rapid formation of fatal ascites precluded longer observation.",

Accelerated tumor growth was evident at the wound site of nude mice 14 days after i.p. injection of K12/ TR cells. A number of possible mechanisms could account for this effect, including the local release of growth factors and/ or the formation of a substratum for cell adhesion at the injury site.
