However, SARS and MERS caused worldwide panic, and fears around CoV-19 have been particularly exaggerated by social media. It has led to the spread of disinformation at exceptional speeds, creating an environment of amplified uncertainty that has fueled anxiety and racism in person and online.",

Iran, 9 days after the detection of the first case, with 245 cases and 26 deaths belongs to the third category. In this category, the main goals are as follows: maintaining trust by listening and designing a RC plan based on community risk perception, empowering, ensuring ongoing and complete support, and monitoring and evaluation. The basic steps to obtain these goals are as follows: designing a RC system with community engagement experts, health education experts, and social science experts; coordinating partners to ensure information transfer in time and through different channels; communicating with the community and transfer proper messages, regularly; engaging community by a two-way communication plan; addressing uncertainty by monitoring the risk perception of the community; and capacity building by in-time training and distribution of RCCE guidelines.[11]",
