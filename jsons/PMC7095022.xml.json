The granulocyte population was defined by forward/sideward scatter. Before incubation with analyzing antibodies, Fc receptors were blocked with the anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody IV.3 and the anti-Fc\u03b3RIII antibody 3G8 (1.2 \u03bcg antibody per 106 cells), both obtained from Medarex Inc (Annandale, NJ).

The binding specificity was controlled by incubating a second sample in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 5 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 0.04% azide. The incubations with the monoclonal antibody CSLEX-1 (anti-sLex mouse IgM, obtained from ATCC) were done in hybridoma supernatant. Cells were washed in the same buffer, and first reagents were detected either with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin or with 0.6 \u03bcg/mL FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibodies, both obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). For analysis of the H-antigen, erythrocytes were separated from peripheral blood leukocytes by the same Ficoll gradient. Erythrocytes were incubated with an anti-H antigen monoclonal antibody obtained from Mast Diagnostica (Reinfeld, Germany), which was detected by an FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibody as described above. Immunoglobulin fusion proteins were biotinylated by incubating the purified fusion proteins (at 0.4 or 1 mg/mL) with 0.5 mg/mL sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes.

The presence of blood group O was concluded, because the patient\u2019s erythrocytes did not react with anti-A or anti-B sera. Because the sera of newborns normally do not contain isoagglutinins13 and because erythrocytes are not routinely checked for the presence of H-antigen (because of the rarity of Bombay blood groups in western Europe), the Bombay phenotype of the patient was missed at this time. At 6 months of age, the Oh Bombay blood group phenotype was detected. Conventional analysis was difficult, because 4 blood transfusions with O RhD-negative erythrocyte concentrates were done at 9, 18, 106, and 107 days of life to treat anemia caused by prematurity and several severe systemic infections. For this reason, a monoclonal antibody for H-antigen was used to search for H-antigen expression on the surface of the patient\u2019s erythrocytes and to distinguish the transfused erythrocyte population from that of the patient. The FACS profile of the patient\u2019s erythrocytes was identical to genuine Bombay blood. When anti-H antibodies were used, only a small population of transfused erythrocytes with H-antigen expression was detected 2.5 months after the last transfusion (Fig 5, E ), indicating that \u03b11,2-fucosylation is not occurring either.",

The lectin was coupled to a gel matrix, and the glycopeptides were passed over the column. The bound glycopeptides were eluted with methyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside. In contrast to controls, very little material was specifically bound to the column in the LAD II samples (Fig 7).A defect in mannose metabolism leads to carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes4 and was ruled out in the patient with LAD II (T.

He strongly resembles the 2 other patients in morphologic stigmata, lacks sLex and H-antigen on leukocytes and erythrocytes, respectively, and shows an inability of neutrophils to bind to endothelial selectins. Peripheral leukocyte counts were constantly elevated after the third day of life and eventually led to the diagnosis of the disorder. Coming from a sterile intrauterine environment, surgery necessitated by the meconium ileus on the first day of life might have triggered the release of neutrophil granulocytes from the bone marrow, leukocytes, which then were unable to extravasate from the blood stream because of sLex deficiency. Impaired extravasation led to many infectious complications, which were the predominant clinical problem during the first year of life.",

The broad spectrum of symptoms\u2014ranging from morphologic abnormalities, retarded growth, and psychomotor retardation to an immunodeficiency\u2014indicates the importance of fucosylation, which requires GDP-fucose. This sugar nucleotide is generated in the cytoplasm predominantly from GDP-mannose and then imported into the Golgi complex, where it is transferred to glycoconjugates by different fucosyltransferases. The generalized hypofucosylation found in LAD II suggests a decreased availability of GDP-fucose for the different fucosylation processes. The exact molecular defect of LAD II has not been identified yet. In contrast to other reports, the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose is not affected in our patient with LAD II.16 Fucose supplementation can correct the defect in the fibroblasts of our patient and is currently elucidated in vivo in our patient. The nature of the molecular defect and the benefit of fucose therapy are currently under investigation.",
