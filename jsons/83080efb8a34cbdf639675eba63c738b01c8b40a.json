The first clue of the outbreak appears to be on November 27, 2002, when Canada's Global Public Health International Network (GPHIN), an electronic warning system that is part of the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN), picked up reports of a ''flu outbreak'' in China through Internet media monitoring and analysis, and the data was forwarded to the WHO. Most news media in China did not report the extent of the outbreak, in keeping with the government's policy of not reporting bad news. This hindered the treatment and the recognition that this was a major new epidemic illness. The illness spread extremely quickly, primarily among health care workers and physicians attending to the sick.

Based on this evidence, biologists have come up with a plausible path of transmission: infected bats and uninfected civets came into contact at a market, the virus was transmitted to civets and then multiplied and evolved in civets (or other animals) in the public market, until eventually the virus hopped over to humans.

It is endemic in western Africa and the estimates are of between 100,000 and 300,000 infections per year. The mortality rate varies between 5-25 %, depending on the outbreak. Many more may be infected without symptoms. The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the ''multimammate rat'' of the genus Mastomys. This is a small rat that lives among humans in large areas of West, Central and East Africa. The virus is spread in the droppings and urine of the rats, and may be picked up in dust. The rats are often consumed as food, and if infected, transmission to humans may occur during handling. Human-to-human transmission may also occur through body fluids and sexual transmission, since the virus can be found in semen.
