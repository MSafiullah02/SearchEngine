            "text": "There have been many advances in the management of patients suffering from traumatic injuries. However, trauma remains the leading cause of death in the civilian population younger than 44 years of age [1]. Uncontrolled hemorrhage, including non-compressible hemorrhage, accounts for approximately 40 % of trauma-related deaths [2], in addition to 20\u201340 % of deaths following hospital admission [3]. As hemorrhage continues, patients develop hypovolemic shock in addition to tissue injuries that lead to the activation of multiple factors resulting in acute traumatic coagulopathy. Trauma-induced coagulopathy in and of itself has been associated with an increase in mortality in the trauma population [4\u20137]. Recently, Pati et al. described the endotheliopathy of injury and used plasma to reverse or prevent this systemic injury altogether [8]. In this chapter, we discuss the role of plasma in the resuscitation of the traumatically injured patient to combat acute traumatic coagulopathy, but more importantly to prevent it all together.",

This included 2,802,000 units of plasma frozen within 24 h (FP24), 1,813,000 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 560,000 units of liquid plasma (LQP), and 251,000 units from apheresis collection. The overwhelming majority of units were collected and produced by blood centers with less than 10 % derived from hospitals. Additionally, 8,195,000 units were produced for further manufacturing. In total, 3,882,000 units were transfused in 2011; a decrease of 13.4 % from 2008. The amount of FFP and FP24 transfused decreased over the 3-year period. However, the utilization of thawed plasma (TP) only became reportable in 2011. 1,181,000 units of TP were transfused, amounting to 30.4 % of all transfused plasma, and mostly being transfused at larger institutions. Finally, only 2000 units of LQP were transfused in 2011. The average cost of a unit of FFP and FP24 were $57.91 and $56.08 respectively [9].",

The plasma is then frozen at \u221218 \u00b0C and stored until needed for transfusion. To be called FFP the freezing process must occur within 8 h of donor phlebotomy. FFP contains high levels of all coagulation factors including the labile factors V and VIII. Whole blood yields approximately 200\u2013250 mL of FFP, where apheresis collection yields 400\u2013600 mL. The components are diluted approximately 8\u201320 % by the anticoagulant, a mixture of citrate, phosphate buffer, and dextrose [10\u201312]. Normal levels of factors V and VIII are found in FFP [10]. However, different blood groups yield different concentrations of coagulation factors confounding efforts to standardize therapy. The variations in expression can be as much as a 30 % difference between blood groups. This is exemplified by blood group O level of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor being 30 % lower than other blood groups [11, 12].",

Furthermore, the levels of coagulation factors remained \u226588 % of original levels out to 26 days, except for factors V and VIII [14, 15]. As discussed, the vitamin K dependent factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X) are relatively stable under approved LQP storage conditions.

Achieving this goal is often difficult in environments where a large and rapidly accessible supply of plasma is not available. As described previously, FFP and FP24 require frozen storage and re-warming under very controlled conditions. Furthermore, TP and LQP require storage under refrigerated (4 \u00b0C) conditions. This makes the rapid (within minutes of requirement) administration of plasma difficult at most civilian institutions and nearly impossible for military personnel. These factors, along with data indicating improved survival with balanced resuscitation, led to the recent redevelopment of dried human plasma. Lyophilization, a low-pressure, low-temperature, low-humidity process to convert plasma into powder, is not a new concept as it was first developed and introduced into practice during World War II. Lyophilized plasma (LP)\nwas widely used, and became the primary resuscitative fluid on the battlefield by the end of WWII. Nevertheless, the concept was abandoned following unacceptable rates of viral transmission in the survivors, until modern screening methods improved transmission rates significantly [2]. LP possesses the same viscoelastic coagulation parameters as fresh plasma. In an animal model, Shuja et al. found an insignificant decrease in the activity of factors II, VII, and IX [19]. The French military has utilized dried plasma and has maintained a hemovigilance program since 1994. No adverse effects of infectious transmissions have been reported with the transfusion of more than 1100 units [20]. In 2011, Martinaud et al. described the utilization of freeze-dried plasma (FDP)\nin French intensive care units in Afghanistan, while caring for casualties from all the coalition forces [21]. The process of preparing the FDP involves the centrifugation of plasma. The supernatant is then removed and frozen by slow rotation in an ice slurry. The product is then freeze-dried at \u22128 \u00b0C for 48 h removing much of the CO2, resulting in an alkaline product upon rehydration [19]. FDP was described as easy to use, reconstituting in medical water within 10 min to provide 210 mL of fluid with hemostatic and volume expansive properties. 236 units have been delivered and evaluated without a single adverse event reported [21]. Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) also utilizes FDP (from the German Red Cross) as the preferred resuscitation fluid in the military prehospital setting. Using these dried products facilitates an environment of balanced transfusion from the point of initial resuscitation without playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d while FFP thaws [22].",

Kozar et al. demonstrated that the endothelial glycocalyx is injured during hemorrhagic shock, manifested by shedding into plasma of syndecan-1, one of the endothelial glycocalyx\u2019s proteoglycans [36]. This had been previously demonstrated in models of ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that the injured glycocalyx is partially repaired with the transfusion of plasma in comparison to the infusion of crystalloid solution [36\u201338]. In their study, significantly less volume was needed in the plasma group to maintain mean arterial pressure. The intact glycocalyx was ablated by hemorrhagic shock and signs of early restoration of the glycocalyx were present in the plasma group in comparison to the crystalloid group. Shown in Fig. 20.1 are electron microscopy images of mesenteric venules showing the effects of shock and resuscitation on the endothelial glycocalyx along with its thickness. Furthermore, the authors investigated lung injury with respect to hemorrhagic shock based on alveolar thickness, capillary congestion, and cellularity. They found an increase in all three parameters in the shock model compared to sham. However, the infusion of crystalloid increased all three parameters above the model, while the plasma transfusion group had improvement of all three parameters, suggesting attenuation of lung injury [36]. These findings were also demonstrated by Pati et al.; however, they also demonstrated that the age of the plasma transfused also had an effect on this attenuation of lung injury (older plasma being less beneficial) [8]. Nevertheless, day 5 plasma stored at 4 \u00b0C remained superior to crystalloid infusion with respect to reparative capacity in the animal model [8]. This indicates that a component of plasma, in soluble form, interacts with the endothelial membrane to restore the endothelial glycocalyx. Figure 20.2 shows the vascular injury caused by hemorrhagic shock through hypoxia leading to cell contraction and decreased vascular permeability. Resuscitation with plasma decreases the inflammatory response, promotes endothelial repair, and leads to normalization of the endothelium. This leads to a decrease in vascular permeability; clinically seen as less edema.\n\n",

The shedding of syndecan-1 was negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines INF-gamma, fractalkine, and IL-1beta, and positively correlated with IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine [39]. This correlation suggests that syndecan-1 is not just a marker of endotheliopathy; it may be involved in the restoration of glycocalyx integrity as depicted in Fig. 20.3 [39]. Furthermore, Johansson et al. found an elevated admission syndecan-1 level in severely injured trauma patients to be associated with inflammation, coagulopathy, and increased mortality [40].\n",

Furthermore, gradual achievement of balanced transfusion ratios may not be as beneficial as early plasma transfusion [50]. Initiating plasma transfusion early also led to a decrease in the total amount of RBCs transfused during the initial 24 h following admission [50]. PROMMTT clearly showed that earlier plasma was associated with improved survival; however, few patients received consistent ratios. There was significant concern that higher ratios would lead to increased hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). However, Robinson et al. showed that hypoxia was associated with excessive crystalloid infusion rather than plasma [51]. Lastly, it was clear from the PROMMTT data that the two ratios that clinicians were trying to transfuse were 1:1 and 1:2.",

The PROPPR study was the first multicenter randomized trial comparing transfusion strategies with mortality as the primary endpoint. It provided evidence for the commonly held belief that balanced transfusion protocols were beneficial to severely injured patients with hemorrhagic shock. Although no significant differences in 24-h and 30-day mortality were found between the two transfusion ratios investigated (plasma\u2013platelet\u2013RBC ratio of 1:1:1 versus 1:1:2), the early availability of blood products transfused within minutes of arrival in a balanced (1:1:1) ratio achieved hemostasis more often and decreased hemorrhage-related deaths within the first 24 h following admission [18]. Furthermore, while the balanced transfusion group received significantly more plasma and platelets within the first 24 h, no difference was found in the rate of 23 prespecified complications including the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), ARDS, transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), TRALI, and allergic reactions. Consistent with the biology of bleeding patients, the median time to hemorrhagic death in PROPPR was 2.3 h. In a post hoc analysis, at 3 h after admission there was a significant mortality difference between the two groups [18].",

In the prehospital setting the emphasis centers on the cessation of bleeding. This occurs in parallel with hypotensive resuscitation utilizing liquid plasma and packed red blood cells. LQP and packed RBCs are utilized by our hospital-based helicopter program, Life Flight. Patients are identified as requiring a prehospital transfusion based upon the assessment of blood consumption (ABC) score. Over a 20-month study period, 942 units (244 RBCs and 698 plasma units) were placed on the Life Flight helicopters with a 1.9 % waste rate [26]. Once a severely injured patient reaches the trauma center, a rapid thromboelastograph (r-TEG), venous blood gas, and hemoglobin levels are drawn and immediately analyzed. In patients that have an ABC score <2 (1 point each for penetrating mechanism, systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, heart rate >120 beats/min, and a positive focused abdominal assessment with sonography for trauma) or without substantial bleeding (<3 units/h), the r-TEG is used to guide blood product resuscitation [52]. Patients that are in shock, are hypotensive, or have an ABC score \u2265 2 are started on the massive transfusion protocol and receive 1:1:1 ratio-driven resuscitation [53]. The patient then either proceeds to the operating room or interventional radiology. The response to resuscitation is closely monitored. Once clinical bleeding has slowed considerably or ceased the resuscitation is converted to goal-driven resuscitation utilizing r-TEG [53].",

In 2013, the FDA reported that TRALI represented 37 % of all fatalities secondary to blood transfusions for that year and 38 % from 2009 to 2013. Plasma, specifically FP24 was implicated in two of the 17 cases and a plasma product may have been implicated in four other cases that received multiple transfusions. Interestingly, no units of FFP were implicated in 2013. The number of cases of TRALI has significantly decreased over the study period following voluntary measures taken by the transfusion community [59].

These specific antibodies are found exclusively in post-partum female plasma and in male plasma from donors who have previous received a transfusion. Some authors believe TRALI\nto develop in two steps. A predisposing condition must be present that incites the release of cytokines leading to the attachment of neutrophils to the pulmonary capillary endothelium. The second step occurs with neutrophil priming, activation and pulmonary injury [13, 60]. In 2008, Eder et al. reported a reduction in the incidence of TRALI with the conversion to male-predominant plasma for transfusion [13, 61]. Unpublished data from the Texas Trauma Institute demonstrate that with the increase usage of plasma in resuscitating trauma patients the incidence of TRALI did not increase. There were nine incidences of TRALI related to plasma transfusion in over 180,000 units transfused. The incidence was approximately 1:20,000 units [62].",

There have been no reported cases of prion disease transmission following plasma transfusion; however, animal studies have shown that it is possible [71].",

Three hundred and twenty incidents occurred in 2012 including allergic, hypotensive, and severe febrile reactions. Thirty-one cases were associated with transfusion of FFP, which included 13 anaphylactic/severe allergic reactions, 12 moderate allergic reactions, four hypotensive reactions, one febrile reaction, and one mixed febrile/allergic reaction. No deaths were related to any type of transfusion reaction [57]. Moderate allergic reactions present with an urticarial rash, wheezing, and other symptoms not severe enough to be termed anaphylactic and occur in 1\u20133 % of transfusions. Anaphylaxis includes bronchospasm, angioedema, severe hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse and is a rare occurrence [13, 55, 57, 58, 68].",
