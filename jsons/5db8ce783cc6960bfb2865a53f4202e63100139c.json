            "text": "The global pandemic of COVID-19 has infected millions of people since its first outbreak in last December, and the daily new cases are still climbing by hundreds of thousands as of May 2020. A key challenge for preventing and controlling COVID-19 is how to quickly, widely, and effectively implement the test for the disease, because testing is the first step to break the chains of transmission. To assist and speed up the diagnosis of the disease, radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage patients into different risk levels. Deep learning methods have been considered as very powerful tools and have taken a more active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images, as witnessed in many recent works in the past few weeks. Most of these works first train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains may lead to poor performance due to domain shift, especially on the biomedical datasets which can be collected and preprocessed quite differently from different hospitals. Also, the small scale of the COVID-19 dataset on the target domain can make the training fall into the overfitting trap. To solve all these crucial problems and fully exploit the available large-scale chest x-ray image dataset[32], we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting, through which we are motivated to reduce the domain shift and avoid overfitting when training on a very small dataset of COVID-19. In addressing this formulated problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA), which is able to align the data distributions across different domains in a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models, as well as effectively separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia. * Both authors contributed equally to this research.",

In the US, the total COVID-19 cases grew from just one confirmed on Jan 21, 2020 to over 1 million on April 28, 2020 in a span of 3 months. Despite drastic actions like shelterin-place and contact tracing, the total cases in US kept increasing at an alarming daily rate of 20,000 -30,000 throughout April, 2020. A key challenge for preventing and controlling COVID-19 right now is the ability to quickly, widely and effectively test for the disease, since testing is usually the first in a series of actions to break the chains of transmission and curb the spread of the disease.",

While taking samples from the patients, aerosol pathogens could be released and would put the healthcare workers at risk. Furthermore, once the sample is collected, the testing process usually takes several hours and recent study reports that the sensitivity of PT-PCR is around 60-70% [1] , which suggests that many people tested negative for the virus may actually carry it thus could infect more people without knowing it. On the other hand, the sensitivity of chest radiology imaging for COVID-19 was much higher at 97% as reported by [1, 8] .",

            "text": "Annotated datasets are required for training AI-based methods, and a small chest x-ray dataset with COVID-19 is collected recently: COVID-ChestXray [6] . In the last few weeks, several works [2, 20, 22, 23] apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning to detect COVID-19 cases from chest x-ray images. They first train a CNN on a large dataset like Chexpert [14] and ChestXray14 [32] , and then fine-tune the model on the small COVID-19 dataset. By far, due to the lack of large-scale open COVID-19 chest x-ray imaging datasets, most works only used a very small amount of positive COVID-19 imaging samples [6] . While the reported metrics like accuracy and AUC are high, it is likely that these models overfit on this small dataset and may not achieve the reported performance on a larger COVID-19 x-ray dataset. Besides, these methods suffer a lot from label domain shift: these newly trained models lose the ability to detect common thoracic diseases like \"Effusion\" and \"Nodule\" since these labels do not appear in the new dataset. Moreover, they also ignored the visual domain shift between the two datasets. On the one hand, the large-scale datasets like ChestXray14 [32] and Chexpert [14] are collected from top U.S. health institutes like National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical center and Stanford University, which are well-annotated and carefully processed. On the other hand, COVID-ChestXray [6] is collected from a very diverse set of hospitals around the world and they are of very different qualities and follow different standards, such as the viewpoints, aspect ratios and lighting, etc. In addition, COVID-ChestXray contains not only chest x-ray images but also CT scan images.",

Different from traditional unsupervised domain adaptation which requires the label set of both source and target domain to be the same, the open set domain adaptation allows different domains to have different label sets. This is more suitable for our problem because COVID-19 is a new disease which is not included in the ChestXray14 or Chexpert dataset. However, since our task is to train a new classifier for COVID-19 dataset, we have to use some annotated samples. Therefore, we further propose to view the problem as a Semi-Supervised Open Set Domain Adaptation problem (Definition 2).",

SODA learns the domain-invariant features by a two-level alignment, namely, domain level and common label level. The general domain discriminator D \u0434 is responsible for guiding the feature extractor G f to extract domain-invariant features. However, it has been argued that the general domain discriminator D \u0434 might lead to false alignment and even negative transfer [26, 34] . For example, it is possible that the feature extractor G f maps images with \"Pneumonia\" in the target domain and images with \"Cardiomegaly\" in the source domain into similar positions, which might result in the miss-classification of G y . In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel common label discriminator D c to guide the model to align images with common labels across domains. For labeled images, D c only activates when the input image is associated with a common label. For unlabeled images, we propose a common label recognizer R to predict their probabilities of having a common label.",

In contrast, domain adaptation models have better localization in general, and our SODA model gives more focused and accurate pathological locations than other models compared. In addition, we consult a professional radiologist with over 15 years of clinical experience from Wuxi People's Hospital and received positive feedback on the pathological locations as indicated by the Grad-CAM of SODA. In the future, we plan to do a more rigorous evaluation study with more inputs from radiologists.

Deep domain adaptation approaches are usually implemented through discrepancy minimization [30] or adversarial training [9, 10, 29] . Adversarial training, inspired by the success of generative adversarial modeling [11] , has been widely applied for promoting the learning of transfer features in image classification. It takes advantage of a domain discriminator to classify whether an image is from the source or target domains. On top of these methods, a couple of works have been presented for exploring the high-level structure in the label space, which aim at further improving the domain adaptation performance for multi-class image classification [34] or fundamentally solving the application problem when the label sets from source domains and target domains are different [36] . In order to meet the latter target, more and more researchers have started to study the open set domain adaptation problem, in which case the target domain has images that do not come from the classes in the source domain [25, 36] . Universal domain adaptation is the latest method that is proposed through using an adversarial domain discriminator and a non-adversarial domain discriminator to successfully solve this problem. [36] . Although domain adaptation has been well explored, its application in medical imaging analysis, such as domain adaptation for chest x-ray images, is still under-explored.",

Accordingly, we propose a novel deep domain adversarial neural network, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA), which is able to align the data distributions across different domains at both domain level and common label level. Through evaluations of the classification accuracy, we show that SODA achieves better AUC-ROC scores than the recent state-of-the-art models. We further demonstrate that the features extracted by SODA is more tightly related to the lung pathology locations, and get initial positive feedback from an experienced radiologist. In practice, SODA can be generalized to any semi-supervised open set domain adaptation settings where there are a large well-annotated dataset and a small newly available dataset. In conclusion, SODA can serve as a pilot study in using techniques and methods from domain adaptation to radiology imaging classification problems. ",
