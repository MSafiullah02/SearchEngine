Systematic reviews are used extensively in evidence based medicine (this is the domain we consider in the rest of the paper), both for healthcare decision making and institutional policy mandates concerning health topics. While systematic reviews strive to be methodical and comprehensive, there are still a number of processes associated with them which introduce bias and subjectivity. Arguably, the process which contributes the most bias is the construction of search strategies. The main element of a search strategy is a complex Boolean query. This is issued to one or more publication databases (e.g., PubMed, EMBASE). Retrieved studies are first screened (i.e., the title and abstracts are assessed) for potential inclusion in the review. Then, the full-text of screened studies deemed potentially relevant to the review are assessed to determine if they should be synthesised in the final review [5].",

Here, the query is formulated by dividing the research question of a systematic review into multiple high-level concepts, and then choosing suitable synonyms for each concept. Query formulation is typically performed by trained information specialists (e.g., librarians), who use domain expertise and intuition to decide, for example, what keywords to add to a query and where they should be added, what kind of field restrictions should be applied, and when to stop formulating. Often, information specialists also have access to a handful of studies (seeds) that the researchers are certain will be included in the synthesis of the review. In the conceptual approach, information specialists use the few seed studies to repeatedly gauge the effectiveness of the queries they formulate in an ad-hoc manner.",

The gold standard set is akin to the seed studies considered in the conceptual approach, but generally much larger (conceptual: a handful; objective: in the order of 10s-100s). Despite the name, this method is still ad-hoc and involves manual trial-and-error with respect to choosing a subset of the identified keywords to add to the query, and where to place keywords in the query.

[4] for objectively deriving medical systematic review search strategies. Our approach does not require manual human involvement, nor trial-and-error procedures, and, in fact, is capable of generating a query automatically, given a set of relevant studies as input. Furthermore, we evaluate this method on a large set of 40 systematic reviews from a collection used for the evaluation of automation methods in this context [6] and further replicate a small study by Hausner et al. [4]. We also consider the cost factors of systematic review development in our evaluation. The primary goal of this research is to develop a more transparent and less subjective method to search strategy development by computationally adapting and extending the current objective approach. Achieving total recall of the relevant literature for a study is important. However, the effectiveness of systematic reviews is often hampered by the fact that they are resource-intensive and often become out-of-date at the time of publication [21]: it takes on average 2 years and AUD$350K to create a systematic review [9, 13] and currently only 36% of Cochrane SRs are deemed up-to-date. The largest time and monetary cost involved in systematic review creation is the screening phase, which is directly influenced by the number of studies retrieved by the search strategy. Furthermore, the exponentially growing body of published research casts doubts on how effective the reviews are in identifying all relevant research; potentially introducing bias.",

These references form the \u2018test\u2019 set, which is divided into a development set (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{2}{3}$$\\end{document}) and a validation set (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{1}{3}$$\\end{document}). The title and abstract of each of the references in the test set is then analysed by ranking each term by the frequency it appears in each of the references (i.e., document frequency \u2013 DF). Next, these terms are filtered to include the top 20% of terms according to DF. At the same time, a population set (i.e., a background collection) of 10,000 studies is identified by issuing an empty search to PubMed and restricting results to the last 12 months (the default ranking of PubMed is by descending publication date). The previously filtered terms are filtered yet again to include the bottom 2% of terms according to DF. Finally, the 20 most frequent MeSH terms are identified from studies in the development set. A Boolean query is then developed by dividing terms into three categories (which form three clauses, linked with the Boolean AND operator): (1) terms relating to health conditions, (2) terms relating to a treatment, and (3) terms relating to the types of study design to be included. Through a time consuming process of trial-and-error, filtered terms and MeSH terms are then added to one of the three clauses of the query depending on the category of the term. Terms inside a category are combined using an OR operator, and the three categories are then combined with an AND operator. The effectiveness of the query is then compared to the validation set.",

The unseen set is used to approximate how the query will perform on studies which are not assessed (i.e., a study which is relevant, but which may never be retrieved by the query, and therefore never screened for potential relevance). It also allows us to develop the query on the development set, tune parameters values on the validation set, and study their effectiveness on the unseen set. We then follow the same method of filtering terms using the development set and the population set, as well as identifying MeSH terms to use. To automatically assign a category for a term, the semantic type of a term is used. The semantic type is obtained automatically by mapping terms to UMLS concepts via MetaMap [1] (version 2018 with options set to their default values and using UMLS2018AA). If a term does not map to a concept in MetaMap, it is discarded. Once a semantic type is obtained for a term, it is automatically categorised in a two fold process: (i) if the semantic type is present in Table 1a, then the term is mapped accordingly [22], (ii) if the semantic type is not present, then the semantic group of the semantic type is used to broadly categorise the term according to Table 1b. Note that in step (ii), some terms may be discarded due to the semantic group they belong to, denoted by \u2018None\u2019 in the table. Following this process, the identified MeSH terms are then added to one or more of the three categories according to the top-level MeSH parent in Table 1c. Once all of the identified terms are categorised, the computational assembly of the Boolean query takes place.\n",

In other words, that term contributes nothing overall to the query (or its contribution is redundant as its contributing studies are also retrieved by other query terms) and is removed from its respective clause. Note that this technique could also be used in an interactive system to highlight to a user those terms that do not contribute to the set of retrieved documents, or alternatively for evaluating existing search strategies. The iteration proceeds by considering one candidate term for removal at a time; terms are ordered descending by the sum of the components of their document vectors, i.e., their total document frequency, thus the order of terms removed is deterministic. The complexity of this approach is O(3n): each term in the query is required to be only tested once for inclusion in the final query, rather than for all possible combinations. The resulting query is guaranteed to retrieve the maximum number of relevant studies possible in the development set (based on the terms which have been identified in the previous process).",

Each topic comprises the title of the review, the Boolean query used to retrieve studies, and relevance assessments for the studies retrieved by the query. To determine the effectiveness of queries, we execute them in PubMed through the entrez API [16]. In our experiments, the test set for each topic is derived from the studies labelled relevant at an abstract level: these are studies that were retrieved by the Boolean query of the original systematic review and were screened for inclusion. We set the minimum size of the development set to 25, therefore excluding topics from the collection where the number of studies labelled relevant was less than 50 (development = 2/4 of total size). This number was chosen as the size of the development set in the study by Hausner et al. [4] was 25 (for a single topic). For comparison, the development set in a study by Simon et al. [20] was 78 (single topic).

Likewise, where there are gains in recall, there are significant losses in precision compared to the original queries (e.g., queries tuned for recall with the addition of MeSH terms obtained the highest recall, however suffer a significant loss in precision). Figure 2 highlights the differences in parameter choices tuned for each evaluation measure. Higher DF thresholds for the development and lower DF thresholds for the population lead to queries with higher precision and lower recall. Lower DF thresholds for the development and higher thresholds for the population lead to queries with higher recall and lower precision. Furthermore, adding more MeSH terms increased recall but at the expense of precision, as expected. Finally, while using the validation set appears to be a good indication of how the query will perform on unseen data, over-fitting leads to the trade-off in precision and recall. The correlation between the performance on the validation data and the unseen data is presented in Fig. 3. The figure suggests that performance obtained when tuning parameters on the validation set are strongly correlated with those obtained on unseen data (for the same parameters values).

Next, we have observed that in the current approach only unigrams are used as candidate terms for possible inclusion in queries (this is also the case in the original method and has already been identified as an issue [4]). This is a limitation because the semantic context that may have been encoded as a phrase (e.g., in an n-gram such as \u201cmyocardial infarction\u201d) is lost.
