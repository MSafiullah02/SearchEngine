However, new chemical compounds are often initially disclosed in patent documents, and only a small fraction of these compounds are published in journals, usually taking an additional 1\u20133 years after the patent [13]. Therefore, most chemical compounds are only available through patent documents [3]. In addition, chemical patent documents contain unique information, such as reactions, experimental conditions, mode of action, which is essential for the understanding of compound prior art, providing a means for novelty checking and validation as well as pointers for chemical research in both academia and industry [1, 2]. As the number of new chemical patent applications has been drastically increasing [11], it is becoming crucial to develop natural language processing (NLP) approaches that enable automatic extraction of key information from the chemical patents [2].",

In particular, we will focus on two key information extraction tasks of chemical named entity recognition (NER) and chemical reaction event extraction. While previous related shared tasks focusing on chemicals or drugs such as CHEMDNER [7] have also included chemical named entity recognition as a task, those have primarily focused on PubMed abstracts. The CHEMDNER patents task [8] was limited to entity mentions and chemical entity passage detection, and only considered titles and abstracts of patents. For our ChEMU lab, we extend the existing corpora in several directions: first, we go beyond chemical NER to require labeling of the role of a chemical with respect to a reaction, and to consider complete chemical reactions in addition to entities. The ChEMU website is available at: http://chemu.eng.unimelb.edu.au.",

In tension with this is the need to claim broad scope for intellectual property reasons, and hence patents typically contain more details and are more exhaustive than scientific papers [9].",
