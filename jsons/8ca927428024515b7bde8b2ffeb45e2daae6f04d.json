A review of this literature suggests that humans have been afflicted by viruses throughout their evolutionary history, although the number and types have changed. Some viruses show evidence of long-standing intimate relationship and cospeciation with hominids, while others are more recently acquired from other species, including African monkeys and apes while our line was evolving in that continent, and domesticated animals and rodents since the Neolithic. Viral selection for specific resistance polymorphisms is unlikely, but in conjunction with other parasites, viruses have probably contributed to selection pressure maintaining major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity and a strong immune response. They may also have played a role in the loss in our lineage of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a cell-surface receptor for many infectious agents. Shared viruses could have affected hominid species diversity both by promoting divergence and by weeding out less resistant host populations, while viruses carried by humans and other animals migrating out of Africa may have contributed to declines in other populations. Endogenous retroviral insertions since the divergence between humans and chimpanzees were capable of directly affecting hominid evolution through changes in gene expression and development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute life strategy: A strategy (similar to r-selection) in which a virus increases fitness by increasing its reproductive rate (offspring produced per parent generation).

But a population must constantly interact with and adapt to these other organisms if it is to survive and reproduce. Food species, predators, and agents of infectious disease have all played a role in human evolution, and among the latter, viruses were probably particularly important. As significant causes of morbidity and mortality, and in their capacity to act as \"molecular genetic parasites\" (Luria, 1959) , viruses are in a strong position to influence the evolution of their hosts (May, 1995; Villarreal, 1999; Balter, 2000) . While this is wellrecognized in studies of the evolution of other organisms (especially plants, e.g., Thompson and Burdon, 1992; Simms, 1996) , the impact of infectious disease on human evolution has not received the attention it deserves (Swedlund, 2000) . Yet viral parasites have probably played an important role in human evolution (de Souza Leal and Zanotto, 2000) . The purpose of this paper is to review recent work in the molecular genetics of human viruses and to assess the extent to which viruses were significant parasites of earlier hominids (and thus in a position to have affected human evolution before the Neolithic). It also speculates on the roles they may have played. Haldane (1949) was among the first to suggest that the struggle against infectious disease was an important evolutionary process, and he described some possible effects. A disease that kills or lowers fertility is a likely selective agent. It can be an advantage or a disadvantage to a species in competition with others, even contributing to extinction. Most species contain considerable genetic diversity in their resistance against disease, and considering the speed with which new pathogens evolve (in general much faster than the host), it is in the best interests of the host to be genetically diverse and highly mutable in the loci concerned with disease resistance. In the view of Haldane (1949) , disease may even favor speciation, by coupling this diversity and mutability with geographic isolation. In addition, transmission requirements may have contributed to host population size and structure and behavioral characteristics such as negative reaction to fecal odors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 570, "end": 583, "text": "(Luria, 1959)", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 661, "end": 672, "text": "(May, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 673, "end": 690, "text": "Villarreal, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 691, "end": 704, "text": "Balter, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 809, "end": 835, "text": "Thompson and Burdon, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 836, "end": 848, "text": "Simms, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 946, "end": 962, "text": "(Swedlund, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1076, "text": "(de Souza Leal and Zanotto, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1410, "text": "Haldane (1949)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2099, "text": "Haldane (1949)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "As the scientific community became more aware of \"surprising biochemical diversity\" (Haldane, 1949, p. 329) in virtually every animal investigated, geneticists sought to explain it.

Some suggested that interactions between parasites and hosts played an important role in maintaining this degree of polymorphism (Clarke, 1976) . Hamilton et al. (1990) suggested that the need for genetic diversity in a \"host-pathogen arms race\" even contributed to the evolution of sexual reproduction. We now know that this level of polymorphism (30%) is probably an underestimate, based on incomplete sampling of rare mutations. Given the frequency of DNA polymorphism (about one in every 500 nucleotides), nearly all genes may be polymorphic (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994) . The human genome is now estimated to contain between two and three million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and even though less than 1% are estimated to result in variation in proteins, this still leaves enough to involve many more than 30% of the estimated 20,000 -30,000 human genes (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2003; Venter et al., 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 107, "text": "(Haldane, 1949, p. 329)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 289, "end": 312, "text": "(Selander et al., 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 444, "end": 458, "text": "(Clarke, 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 461, "end": 483, "text": "Hamilton et al.

Its closest relatives are camelpox, gerbilpox, and monkeypox, the latter maintained in a rodent reservoir, in spite of its name (Douglas and Dumbell, 1996) .

Their replication is more errorprone, with high base substitution rates by viral enzymes that typically lack proof-reading ability, on the order of 10 4 -10 6 times the rates for DNA viruses and cellular genomes (Simmonds, 2001) . Mutation rates are even greater for retroviruses, whose reverse transcriptases operate close to the error catastrophe threshold, the level of critical-copying fidelity below which information can no longer be maintained and the nucleotide sequences of viral RNA would become essentially random (Domingo and Holland, 1994) . Fast mutation rates help keep RNA viruses fairly small, as larger genomes could not sustain these rates of change and still remain capable of replicating. Many RNA viruses also undergo frequent recombination via \"copy-choice\" (in which the RNA polymerase switches templates during replication), and those with segmented genomes (e.g., influenza) can reassort (Morse, 1994) . All this results in a sort of \"modular\" evolution for these viruses and much faster rates of evolution than those of DNA viruses (Holland, 1993; Domingo and Holland, 1994 ) (recombination also occurs in DNA viruses, but via \"breakage and reunion\" as in host-cell genomes, and it is less frequent than among RNA viruses).

Rotaviruses are ubiquitous in nature and are found in both animals and plants. They are probably old viruses and might have afflicted some of our hominid ancestors. Evidence of this, however, has been overwritten by the tendency of these viruses to be shared by multiple host species.

Many of these are the closest known relatives of human enteroviruses (with the exception of viruses derived from human strains, e.g., swine vesicular disease virus, thought to have originated from coxsackie B; Poyry et al., 1999) , while other simian viruses cluster together and probably represent a previously unknown picornavirus genus (Oberste et al., 2002) . There are more than 60 human enteroviral serotypes, including 3 polio, 23 Coxsackie A, 6 Coxsackie B, and 30 echoviruses. They are common in humans, and most of them cause no apparent infection. A high proportion (\u03fe99%) of polio infections are subclinical as well, and the virus was endemic in developing countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas until recently (Rico-Hesse et al., 1987;  polio has now been largely eradicated everywhere except sub-Saharan Africa and India, thanks to WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative; World Health Organization, 2001). The neuropathogenic-ity of wild polio is low and requires spread of the virus from the intestinal tract to motor neurons (Crainic and Kew, 1993) . Poliovirus may persist in the organism and continue to be shed after acute infection (Domingo et al., 1998) , allowing it to be maintained in small isolated populations, although Black (1990) thought that poliovirus was introduced into South American Indians. Wild polio type 1 strains (the most common cause of polio) correlate better with geography than with time of isolation, meaning that viruses isolated at different times in a single geographic region are more closely related to one another than are polioviruses from several regions isolated in the same year (as would be found in the case of pandemic influenza, for example). This argues for the relative stability of this virus, with strains from Africa and the Mideast having the deepest roots (Rico-Hesse et al., 1987) . It further suggests that enteroviruses, including poliovirus, have long been associated with hominids, either coevolving with us or possibly entering our line from other primates sometime during our evolution in Africa.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 69, "end": 95, "text": "(Rodrigo and Dopazo, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 96, "end": 118, "text": "Gromeier et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 247, "end": 269, "text": "(Doherty et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 621, "end": 640, "text": "Poyry et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 750, "end": 772, "text": "(Oberste et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1164, "text": "(Rico-Hesse et al., 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1165, "text": "", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1483, "text": "(Crainic and Kew, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1593, "text": "(Domingo et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1677, "text": "Black (1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2267, "text": "(Rico-Hesse et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RNA viruses"}, {"text": "Other viruses that may have cospeciated with primates include the various hepatitis viruses (Robertson, 2001; Simmonds, 2001) .

The woolly monkey virus is still closest to the South American human type F; that and the existence of the only other known mammalian hepadnaviruses in American rodents (e.g., woodchucks, squirrels) still suggest to some an American origin by cross-species transmission. Others have proposed that HBV coevolved with humans and diversified as they migrated from Africa during the last 100,000 years (Magnius and Norder, 1995) . But the viral phylogeny does not parallel genetic relationships between human and nonhuman primate hosts, which presents a problem for any coevolutionary model. A third scenario involves multiple zoonotic transmissions, analogous to what some believe has happened with HIV (see below), with donor species remaining unidentified (MacDonald et al., 2000) . Recent zoonotic transmission is not supported by the separation of human and ape clusters, however, as one would expect in that case to see a mosaic branching pattern of human and ape strains (Verschoor et al., 2001) . The latest and perhaps best explanation of this confusing picture is that primate HBVs cospeciated with their hosts (both woolly monkey and apes) over the last 10 -35 my (which leads to a very low estimate of mutation rate, by the way, but similar to that obtained if cospeciation is assumed for rodent and woolly monkey viruses), with human strains being of ancient zoonotic origin (sometime before leaving Africa), perhaps via processing of primates for food (Simmonds, 2001) . Since that time, dispersal from Africa and rapid population growth (providing more opportunities for horizontal transmission) led to faster mutation rates and diversification of the human virus (Robertson and Margolis, 2002) .

SIV cpz from P.t. schweinfurthii is quite divergent from HIV (Santiago et al., 2002) , and it was not found at all in 387 P.t. verus from West Africa (Prince et al., 2002) .

Both HTLV-I and -II are older retroviruses than HIV, and have evolved more slowly because of their greater tendency to integrate into the cellular genome and consequent potential for vertical transmission. This leads to mostly inapparent lifelong infections like those caused by DNA viruses. On the other hand, the tendency of HTLV-I to jump species barriers can lead to rapid viral evolution, as in other retroviruses. Because of this difference, HTLV-I and HTLV-II have contrasting evolutionary histories (Fig. 14; Slattery et al., 1999; Salemi et al., 2000) . HTLV-I appears to have originated in Asia between 50 -100 kya, moved to Africa where it explosively spread through Central African anthropoids (including humans) with many occasions of interspecies transmission, and eventually spread as a \"cosmopolitan\" variant to the rest of the world Van Dooren et al., 2001) . Geographic variants of HTLV-I thus reflect recent migrations of anatomically modern humans (Slattery et al., 1999) . HTLV-II, on the other hand, is an older virus with an African origin \u03f3400 kya; its closest relative is the simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) of Pan paniscus . Today there are two types of distribution for both HTLV-I and -II: a cosmopolitan epidemic associated with transmission via contaminated blood or needles, and an endemic pattern produced by mother-to-child transmission (via breast milk), with substrains reflecting human migrations (Black, 1997) , but both types I and II originated through interspecies transmission of STLVs to human ancestors . Human and simian viruses in this group are now collectively referred to as \"primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses\" (PTLVs) because African HTLVs and STLVs cannot be separated into distinct phylogenetic lineages according to their species of origin, but are instead related according to the geographic origin of their host . There are six PTLV-I subtypes: subtype A is the \"cosmopolitan\" one, recently derived and estimated to have radiated at least 13 kya; it contains exclusively human strains; B, D, E, and F are Central African subtypes found in humans (including pygmies in Cameroon, Gabon, and Congo) and nonhuman primates; and subtype C is the Australo-Melanesian subtype, found in Papua New Guineans, Australian Aboriginals, and Indonesian macaques (and perhaps orangutans; Verschoor et al., 1998) .

This process was facilitated by RNA viruses' high mutation rates, propensity for interspecies transmission, and ability to recombine or reassort when related viruses coinfect the same host (e.g., mammalian and avian influenza viruses in pigs). Post-Neolithic viruses include the diarrheal calici-and rotaviruses, the coronaviruses of common colds, and ortho-(influenza) and paramyxoviruses that cause a variety of other respiratory diseases. The DNA-based smallpox virus may also be in this category. The generally more acute infections caused by these newer viruses are unlikely to have plagued earlier hominids. At the same time, the existence of RNA viruses in wild primates suggests that hominids had some of these, but the transient nature of these continually drifting viral genomes means that their sequences have been totally overwritten, and their propensity to switch hosts means their descendants may be anywhere. The trail on these is quite cold. 3. On the other hand, the capacity of some RNA viruses to be evolutionarily stable in long-standing reservoir hosts, and other constraints on their ability to evolve, suggest that some of these may be very old human parasites. Hepatitis viruses, picornaviruses, and HTLV became endemic in hominids some time before modern humans left Africa; some of these may have infected the earliest hominids. But like the DNA viruses, these are unlikely to have acted as important agents of selection, given their association with mostly chronic and latent infections, although this may not have been the case in the past. When these viruses were first acquired they were probably more virulent, and different hominid species may have had different susceptibilities. Considering the array of retroviruses found in African monkeys and apes today and the ease with which they cross species barriers, ancient humans may have encountered more than just HTLV. Endogenous retroviruses, moreover, with their ability to retrotranspose into different parts of the host genome, may have played a more direct role in human evolution. 4. Zoonoses, or infectious diseases whose natural hosts are other animals, must have been important causes of disease throughout human evolution (Fenner et al., 1974, p. 632) . Because viruses that must be able to replicate efficiently in more than one host are more genetically stable (Kilbourne, 1994; Scott et al., 1994) , arboviruses such as yellow fever, dengue, and Rift Valley fever have probably been present in Africa during much of our evolution, and mosquitoes capable of transmitting them evolved during the Pliocene (Capasso, 1993) . Bat lyssaviruses, from which rabies is derived, also have a long history in Africa (Bourhy et al., 1993) .

In spite of the lower probability of inheritable change in sexually reproducing animals, there are now several examples of host-pathogen coevolution in animals, probably due to selection acting on preexisting variation. A well-studied example is the introduction of myxoma virus (a natu-ral parasite of American rabbits) into Australian rabbits in the 1950s. The initially very high mortality rates declined over several years, and investigations showed that both rabbits and virus had changed. The same strain of virus that killed 90% of wild-caught rabbits during the first year killed only 30% seven years later, indicating selection for resistance in the host. Meanwhile, virus isolated from wild rabbits showed reduced virulence over time (Fenner and Kerr, 1994) . It is possible that such a scenario might have played itself out during hominid evolution, providing a new pathogen was sufficiently lethal yet capable of being transmitted to enough new susceptibles to be able to persist in the population (but these are a lot of \"ifs\"!). Clarke (1976) suggested that this condition obtains whenever the enhanced ability to resist one pathogen reduces a host's ability to resist another, i.e., the resistant host will still be susceptible to infection with a virus that has mutated to overcome the resistance factor. Changes in cell surface receptor sites may facilitate the binding of viruses with altered coat proteins. Viral proteins may mimic host antigens and thereby escape immune surveillance in most individuals; hosts with rare antigenic types would have an advantage. Many viruses wrap themselves in a host cell membrane on their way out of the infected cell. Upon attacking another individual of a different antigenic type, the new host will respond with antibodies against the antigens picked up from the previous host. Under these conditions, a population with greater heterogeneity in cell surface antigens makes it harder for enveloped viruses to find a tolerant host, and this may have been important in promoting MHC diversity (Bodmer, 1972) .

The relative dearth of known resistance factors to any kind of pathogen reinforces this conclusion. The best-known example of a specific parasitepolymorphism relationship is falciparum malaria and the various alleles associated with resistance to it, including sickle-cell and other hemoglobins and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variants.

Viruses that bind to Neu5Gc include some corona-, rota-, and influenza viruses, which explains why some strains (e.g., avian influenza; Webster, 1997) are not infectious in humans. Neu5Gc is not found in Neandertal fossils; the enzyme that produces it was inactivated in the human line by an Alu insertion estimated to have occurred 2.7-2.8 mya (Chou et al., 2002) .

There would have been strong selective pressure against any reduction in the ability to resist infection (Svanborg-Eden and Levin, 1990) . The MHC, also known in humans as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, is the most highly polymorphic genetic system in mammals. These antigens are present on cell surfaces, and bind foreign antigen fragments for presentation to T-lymphocyte receptors. MHC diversity results from meiotic recombination facilitated by high levels of heterozygosity; diversity in B-cells and in T-cell receptors is generated by somatic recombination, clonal selection, and higher than normal mutation rates, mechanisms thought to have evolved under pressure from parasites (Sarkar, 1992; Knapp, 2002) .
