Four out of five pigs from the PRRS/CSF group became febrile and viraemic earlier than the animals which received CSF virus only. These pigs had to be killed 15-17 days post CSF virus inoculation. One animal in this group survived the acute phase of CSF and recovered completely. It was concluded that the observed divergences of the clinical courses would not have been noticed under field conditions.

This diversity of clinical pictures and the different patterns of distribution and severity of morphological lesions were primarily attributed to host-and virus-related factors (Depner et al., 1996 (Depner et al., , 1997 . However, veterinarians and epidemiologists also discussed the possibility of a dual infection of pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus and CSF virus, which might lead to a changing clinical picture of CSF. Reports were vague, but since PRRS virus has become endemic in Germany, dual infections with PRRS virus and CSF virus could not be excluded. The occurrence of subclinical PRRS infections and the prolonged circulation of this virus within herds give ample opportunities for mixed PRRS/CSF infections during a CSF epidemic. This assumption U. S. Copyright Clearance Center Code Statement: 0931-1793/99/4607-0485$14.00/0 prompted us to perform a study, in order to determine whether a primary PRRS virus infection influences the clinical outcome of experimentally induced CSF in young pigs.",

However, in a few studies the interaction of PRRS virus infection and bacterial infections (e.g. Streptococcus suis) has been proven (Galina et al., 1994) . PRRS virus has also been found in association with other viral diseases, including swine influenza, porcine respiratory coronavirus, paramyxovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus. It is not yet clear to what extent these viruses act synergistically. Brun et al. (1994) could not find any difference between groups of pigs infected with PRRS virus and swine influenza virus or swine influenza virus alone, while Van Reeth et al. (1994) observed potentiation of illness caused by PRRS virus in pigs experimentally challenged 4 days p.i. with both swine influenza and porcine respiratory coronavirus. This apparent increased susceptibility to secondary diseases suggests that PRRS virus infection causes some degree of immunosuppression. Immunosuppression is also a common finding in pigs infected with CSF virus (Trautwein, 1988) . Therefore, an infection with both viruses might lead to a clinical course which differs from that of a solitary CSF infection. So far there are no reports about PRRS/CSF interactions in the pig. However, it is understandable that, due to the variety of clinical pictures in field cases of CSF, a synergistic activity of CSF virus and other pathogens, including the PRRS virus, was often used as an explanation for the diversity of symptoms.",

These pigs would probably not have attracted any attention under field conditions. However, the subsequent inoculation with CSF virus somehow accelerated the disease process. Four out of five pigs from the PRRS/CSF group became febrile and viraemic earlier than the animals which received CSF virus only. The slight difference between the incubation periods in the two groups indicates that there was some difference in the pathogenesis. In terms of clinical signs in the weaners (e.g. fever development), particularly at the beginning of the disease, a homogeneous clinical picture was seen in the group of pigs which received only CSF virus, while the pigs infected first with PRRS virus and 3 days later with CSF virus reacted less uniformly. However, the clinical differences disappeared towards the terminal stage of the CSF infection in all pigs that died. Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that the above-mentioned divergence of clinical courses would not have been noticed under field conditions. Therefore these findings cast doubts on the relevance of PRRS virus infection potentiating the clinical outcome of CSF in young pigs. On the contrary, one pig infected with both viruses survived the infections while none of the pigs of the CSF group recovered.",

The variety of clinical pictures of CSF, as observed during recent CSF outbreaks in Germany, thus appears related more to host and CSF virus factors than to mixed PRRS/CSF virus infections. However, the question remains whether a CSF virus challenge at a more advanced stage of PRRS (e.g. 14 days after PRRS virus infection) leads to a potentiation of the clinical course of CSF. A synergistic activity of these two pathogens cannot be completely excluded yet.",
