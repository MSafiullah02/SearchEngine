This pandemic is accepted as a viral pneumonia pandemic not a simple flu, therefore, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, follow-up, and management of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 is extremely important. Due to the paucity of studies on COVID-19, suggestions are generally within the framework of the experiences gained from China, Italy, USA, and UK that have the biggest war against this disease. In this review, we summarized the essential points of ICU management for COVID-19 patients.1",

Although respiratory failure is often hypoxemic, hypercapnic respiratory failure might also be seen mainly due to mucus plugs. There is a male dominance with male to female ratio being 2/1 in severe cases, whereas according to a recent data from Italy, 82% of patients were male. Although hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common reported comorbidities, advanced age is also a risk factor for the development of severe disease [5].

It is recommended to change the team that takes care of COVID-19 patients in every 14 days. Hereby, a wash-out period is provided.

On the other hand, surging in the ICU capacity brings an incremental demand for equipment such as ventilators, consumable materials, therapeutics and as well as human force as healthcare workers (HCW). For this purpose, elective in-patient admissions and surgeries should be delayed and available wards could be adapted for stepping down other ICU patients in order to evacuate ICUs. Another point is to increase HCW trained in intensive care. Therefore, HCW who are currently working out of ICU should be systematically trained in terms of COVID-19 protocol for supporting ICU staff [11]. ",

Supplemental oxygen should be given via low-flow O2 delivery systems such as nasal cannula (1-6 L/min to provide FiO2 of 0.24\u20130.45), simple face mask (5\u20138 L/min to provide FiO2 up to 0.50\u20130.60), nonrebreather masks with reservoir providing FiO2 up to > 0.85 with 10\u201315 L/min oxygen, titrated according to SpO2. Venturi and diffuser masks are suggested to be avoided. It should be remembered that FiO2 > 0.60 for > 6 h might create O2 toxicity. HFNO therapy and NIMV support may be applied in selected hypoxemic respiratory failure cases with proper PPE because of high risk of aerosol generation. However, these patients should be followed closely in terms of clinical deterioration, if no positive response is obtained in the first few hours (refractory hypoxemia, tachypnoea, tidal volume (Vt) > 9 mL/kg meaning increased minute ventilation and work of breathing). When applying NIMV, a helmet mask may be used, applied with intensive care ventilators or dual-circuit ventilators; a viral/bacterial filter should be added to the circuit. NIMV should not be applied to patients whose secretions cannot be controlled; who have high aspiration risk, impaired mental status, cardiac complications and multiple organ failure; and who are hemodynamically unstable [13]. Prolonged spontaneous breathing may cause uncontrolled intrathoracic negative pressures and induce patient-self-inflicted lung injury similar to ventilator induced lung injury and therefore, must be prevented by utilization of intubation as soon as possible [14].

Intubation with flexible bronchoscopy can be used in difficult intubation. However, bronchoscopy is a high-risk procedure for aerolisation. Use of bag-mask ventilation should be avoided during preoxygenation. Preoxygenation could be performed with nonrebreather mask with reservoir. If bag-mask would be used, a filter should be attached to the bag mask. Neuromuscular blockers can be administered to suppress cough before intubation. Positive pressure ventilation should not be initiated before the endotracheal cuff is inflated and patients must be connected to mechanical ventilator directly without bag ventilation [15]. Closed system aspiration should be provided and bacterial/viral filters should be placed in both inspiratory and expiratory ports of the ventilator. For airway humidification, heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter could be used. Unless absolutely necessary, bronchoscopic procedures should be avoided and metered dose inhaler (MDI) should be preferred instead of nebulization for bronchodilator therapy. However, due to mucus plugs, and increased resistance and dead-space ventilation, active heated humidifier (HH) can be preferred77https://hsgm.saglik.gov.tr/depo/covid19/rehberler/COVID-19_Rehberi.pdf.

Deep sedation may be required to achieve target tidal volumes. In terms of low pH like < 7.15, tidal volume can be increased up to 8 mL/kg. Otherwise permissive hypercapnia may be allowed [16]. If there is no evidence of tissue hypoperfusion, conservative fluid support should be provided. PEEP titration should be applied at pressures that will prevent atelectotraumas and over distention. In moderate (PaO2/FiO2 < 200) and severe (PaO2/FiO2 < 100) ARDS patients, high PEEP may be applied instead of low PEEP. There is not enough data regarding recruitment manoeuvres. Even if the use of neuromuscular blocking agents is not routinely recommended, it can be applied in the presence of resistant hypoxemia or hypercapnia, despite sedation in moderate to severe ARDS with ventilator dyssnchrony and in the first 24\u201348 h of mechanical ventilation. In patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 150, more than 12 h of prone position could be applied daily in patients who are managed by conventional MV interventions. Prone position has been demonstrated to be helpful even in spontaneously breathing nonintubated patients, even with NIMV and HFNO. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) administration could be used as a rescue therapy and could also theoretically be helpful to improve ventilation/perfusion match, since it has been speculated that perfusion is also impaired in ARDS due to COVID-19 and these patients have preserved compliance. Routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended [17]. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered in patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung-protective ventilation, and appropriate patients should be referred to experienced centres. Due to paucity of evidence for this virus and disease pathophysiology, probable advantages of ECMO is ambiguous. ECMO is not a therapy that should be considered in case of a major pandemic regarding the appropriate allocation of resources [18].",

Phenotype characterized by low elastance (high compliance), so called Type L, has low ventilator perfusion ratio, low lung weight, and low recruitability, whereas Type H, characterized by high elastance (low compliance) has high right-to-left shunt, high lung weight, and high recruitability. Severe hypoxemia for high compliant lungs may be elucidated by the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction. They recommend to increase FiO2 as a solution for hypoxemia for those who are not experiencing dyspnoea, in which Type L patient responds well. Early intubation may even cause transition to Type H phenotype. However, for intubated hypercapnic Type L patients, ventilation with more than 6 mL/kg up to 8\u20139 mL/kg does not bring risk of ventilator-associated lung injury. Since Type L phenotypes could have a tolerance in terms of mechanical power by the help of high compliance. Furthermore, administration of high PEEP for nonrecruitable lungs may cause hemodynamic impairment and fluid retention as well. Type H phenotype looks like usual severe ARDS. Therefore, higher PEEP, prone positioning, and even extracorporeal support are classical therapeutic choices. This suggestion has not been proved in large scale studies and postponing intubation in severe hypoxemia and increased work of breathing might be detrimental and early intubation in patients unresponsive to conventional O2 treatment and perhaps short course of NIMV and HFNO is recommended.

Rapid shallow breathing index could be checked so that patients with respiratory rate to tidal volume ratio < 100, have high likelihood of being successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. Instead of weaning trial through t-piece, weaning from pressure support ventilation could be chosen due to less aerosol generation. In COVID-19 patients, high mucus plugs are being reported, therefore, to reduce the risk of reintubation timing of weaning and extubation should be individualized. Whether the cuff leak test should be performed routinely prior to extubation is unclear. If postextubation stridor is highly expected (female sex, fluid overload, prolonged intubation > 5\u20137 days, age > 80 years, large endotracheal tubes > 8\u20138.5 F, difficult and traumatic intubation), cuff-leak test could be performed weighing against risks and/or corticosteroids could be given during extubation. If possible, extubation should be performed in airborne isolation rooms with maximum PPE use. For postextubation respiratory failure, NIMV and/or HFNO should be applied very carefully in selected patients and if there is stridor, immediate intubation should be performed.
