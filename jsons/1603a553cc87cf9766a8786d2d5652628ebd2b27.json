In dual-gene qRT-PCR positive samples, sensitivity 339 increased to 93.7%. We suggest that integrity of viral RNA might impair pathogen ",

For COVID-19 patients, we also found an enrichment of 292 opportunistic pathogen such as Candida genus (Mann Whitney U test, p < 0.001, Figure 293 S3A and C). For further confirmation of this result, we used culture methods to detect 294 Candida genus via VITEK2 25 . There were 2 in 4 ICU patients that were detected 295 Candida genus positive.296 297",
