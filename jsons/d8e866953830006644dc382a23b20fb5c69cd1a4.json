            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV entry is facilitated by the spike protein (S), which consists of an N-terminal domain (S1) responsible for cellular attachment and a C-terminal domain (S2) that mediates viral and host cell membrane fusion. The SARS-CoV S2 is a potential drug target, as peptidomimetics against S2 act as potent fusion inhibitors. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis and thermal stability experiments on electrostatic, hydrophobic, and polar residues to dissect their roles in stabilizing the S2 postfusion conformation was performed. It was shown that unlike the pH-independent retroviral fusion proteins, SARS-CoV S2 is stable over a wide pH range, supporting its ability to fuse at both the plasma membrane and endosome. A comprehensive SARS-CoV S2 analysis showed that specific hydrophobic positions at the C-terminal end of the HR2, rather than electrostatics are critical for fusion protein stabilization. Disruption of the conserved C-terminal hydrophobic residues destabilized the fusion core and reduced the melting temperature by 30 C. The importance of the C-terminal hydrophobic residues led us to identify a 42-residue substructure on the central core that is structurally conserved in all existing CoV S2 fusion proteins (root mean squared deviation 5 0.4 \u00c5 ). This is the first study to identify such a conserved substructure and likely represents a common foundation to facilitate viral fusion. We have discussed the role of key residues in the design of fusion inhibitors and the potential of the substructure as a general target for the development of novel therapeutics against CoV infections.",

[2] [3] [4] The unexpected emergence of the highly pathogenic human SARS-CoV revealed the potential for cross-species transmission from circulating strains of CoVs in zoonotic reservoirs. 5, 6 Recently, a novel beta-coronavirus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, was discovered in the Arabian Peninsula. 7 Since then, the virus has now migrated to the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Africa through infected travelers, and is considered a threat to global health with 42.5% case fatality rate among infected individuals. 8 Genetic sequence analyses show that MERS-CoV belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, along with the bat coronaviruses (BtCoVs) HKU4 and HKU5. 7 Currently, bats host more than 60 CoV species and a number of other SARS-like CoVs were identified from bats in Eurasia, Africa, and North America. 1, 9, 10 Although much has been discovered in the 10 years since the SARS-CoV discovery, emerging zoonotic CoVs continue to cause deadly outbreaks and threaten human health.",

            "text": "CoV infection is initiated by the spike (S) protein on the viral surface. 11 The SARS-CoV S is synthesized as a 1255-amino acid glycoprotein precursor and is classified as a class I viral fusion protein. 12 Upon proteolytic activation, 12 the S protein is cleaved into a S1 domain (residues 12-680) that is responsible for tropism and cellular attachment, and the S2 domain (residues 681-1255) that facilitates virus and host cell membrane fusion. 12, 13 The SARS-CoV S1-S2 heterodimer assembles as a metastable trimer on the viral surface. Similar to other class I viral fusion proteins, such as human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) gp41, Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP 2 ), and influenza A hemagglutinin (HA 2 ), conformational changes in three functional elements of S2: the putative fusion peptide, heptad repeat 1 (HR1), and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) are critical for facilitating the fusion process. 12, 14 Upon activation, the fusion peptide unfolds and inserts into the target cell membrane forming the pre-hairpin intermediate. 14, 15 Subsequently, the HR2 region that anchors the viral membrane folds back near the HR1 trimeric core and triggers the collapse of the prehairpin intermediate state. 15 These conformational changes in the HR1 and HR2 regions draw the viral and host cell membranes together and mediate the merger of the two outer leaflets into a hemifusion stalk intermediate. 14, 15 A final conformational step results in refolding of both HR1 and HR2 into a low energy postfusion state and allows the fusion pore to form. 14, 15 There is a high kinetic barrier for the fusion of the two bilayer membranes; the free energy released during conformational changes of the fusion protein S2 provides the energetics to overcome the kinetic barriers for fusion pore formation. 15 For class I viral fusion proteins, there are three types of fusion triggers: low pH, receptor binding, and proteolytic cleavage. 16 Some viruses, such as avian sarcoma leucosis virus, 17 SARS-CoV, 18 and perhaps Ebola virus, 19, 20 utilize combinations of these triggers. The fusion of SARS-CoV is complex but is thought to require both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage. 11, 12 The proteolytic cleavage event that separates the receptor binding and fusion domains into non-covalently associated fragments depends on the species of CoV. Some CoVs are proteolytically cleaved at the S1-S2 boundary, 21 whereas others remain uncleaved, yet are still infectious. 11, 22 For SARS-CoV, a primary proteolytic cleavage at the S1-S2 boundary, followed by a secondary cleavage at a S2 0 position is often required to mediate membrane fusion. 22 Protease activation by trypsin-like, thermolysin, elastase, and factor Xa proteases on the plasma membrane [23] [24] [25] and cathepsin L proteolytic cleavage in the low pH endosomes were shown to enhance the SARS-CoV infection. [25] [26] [27] Regardless of the route of entry, viral fusion proteins require structural rearrangements in the S2 domain to mediate the merger of the virus and host cell lipid bilayers. 24, 28 Recent studies have identified key features that contribute to the function of viral fusion proteins from viruses that enter either at the plasma membrane or low pH endosomes. Although the atomic resolution structures of the SARS-CoV S1 domain and S2 fusion core in the postfusion hairpin conformation have been determined previously, characterization of specific residues involved in the stabilizing the SARS-CoV S2 during membrane fusion remain unclear. Any functional information regarding the molecular identities of these residues is important for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. In order to understand the structural determinants involved in stabilizing the SARS-CoV S2 fusion protein, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the roles of electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic residues on the SARS-CoV S2 extracellular fusion core and the key features necessary for pH-dependent viral fusion. Our results revealed that the SARS-CoV S2 fusion core is stable over a wide pH range and that specific hydrophobic residues at the HR1-HR2 interface play a major role in stabilizing the six-helix bundle. In contrast, three ion-pairs and chloride-binding site residues were shown to play minor roles in stabilizing the postfusion conformation. Specifically, interhelix interactions between the trimeric coiled-coil HR1 inner core and Cterminal portion of the HR2 helices are important determinants of SARS-CoV fusion, whereas those between the tether and inner HR1 core regions are less important in stabilizing the postfusion state. We also identified a 42-residue conserved substructure within the central heptad repeat region of the SARS-CoV S2 fusion core that we hypothesize will provide a structural foundation for fusion. Our biophysical thermal stability data now explains the inhibition profiles of an array of SARS-CoV S2 peptidomimetics. The results presented here provide insights into the general mechanisms of viral fusion and identify an attractive site for coronavirus fusion inhibitor design.",

Each repeat consists of a seven-residue abcdefg motif, where hydrophobic residues (leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and valine) are displayed in the a and d positions. The C-terminal segment of each protomer extends alongside the inner core in an antiparallel manner. These residues first form the random coil tether (residues 1142-1160) and then second heptad repeat region (HR2) between residues 1161-1179.

There are no existing structural models of the entire SARS-CoV S2 protein. The SARS-CoV S2 fusion core, consisting of only the HR1 and HR2 helical regions, has been crystallized, and the structure solved. Commonly, the SARS-CoV S2 fusion core is reconstituted through the addition of synthesized peptides corresponding to HR1 and HR2 regions. [29] [30] [31] Here, we designed a linked recombinant SARS-CoV S2 fusion protein (SARS-CoV S2 L2H) using N-terminal residues 896-972 and Cterminal residues 1142-1183, with a six-residue glycine-serine linker (GGS-GGS) between the two regions [ Fig. 1(A) ]. This construct is similar to a previously designed construct. 32 When expressed using an Escherichia coli SHuffle T7 expression system, we were able to obtain multi-milligram quantities of protein. The SARS-CoV S2 L2H is soluble and migrates as a stable trimer on size exclusion chromatography. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the trimeric nature of the SARS-CoV S2 L2H [ Fig. 1(B) ]. Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the protein was characterized by double minima at 208 and 222 nm, the typical CD signature for a predominantly ahelical protein [ Fig. 1(C) ]. The CD wavelength scans for all SARS-CoV S2 L2H mutants were similar (data not shown), suggesting that the relative ahelical content did not change as a result of the mutations. Moreover, SARS-CoV S2 L2H contains an estimated 50% a-helical content, in line with the secondary structural composition seen in the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV S2.",

The wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV S2 L2H denatured irreversibly with a melting temperature (T m ) of 97.0 C at neutral pH. This is consistent with the previously reported T m for SARS-CoV S2 of >90 C. 35 The Gibbs free energy of unfolding cannot be calculated from an irreversible denaturation curve; however, the apparent melting temperature may provide a simple measure of protein stability. At all pH levels, the SARS-CoV S2 L2H fusion core was highly stable [ Fig. 2 (A); Table  I ]. As pH was increased, the T m values remained unchanged (95 C). At lower pH conditions that correspond to early (6.0-6.5) and late (5.0-6.0) endosomal environments, slightly lower melting temperatures from 92.9 C to 94.6 C were observed. Varying pH did not appear to have drastic effects on protein stability [ Fig. 2(B) ]; the postfusion SARS-CoV S2 L2H is stable from pH 4.0 to 8.5.",

Electrostatic interactions can contribute up to 10 kcal/mol in free energy, 36 and thus are important factors for stabilizing protein structures. The free energy contribution of a salt bridge is pHdependent, as the ionization of the side chain is affected by the pH of the local environment. 36 The SARS-CoV S2 fusion core structure revealed three sets of electrostatic interactions clustered in two regions of the protein. 30 The HR1-HR2 region contains two salt bridge pairs: between Arg1167 and Glu918 in the middle of the HR2, and between Glu1164 and Lys929 residues at the membranedistal end of the HR2 [ Fig. 3(A) ]. A third complex intersubunit electrostatic interaction is formed between Arg965, Asp967, and Glu970 at the base of the HR1 helical core. Alanine mutations to abrogate these salt bridges led to a modest decrease in melting temperatures (DT m < 8 C) [ Fig. 3 (B); Table II ]. Interestingly, charge reversal mutations (Lys929Glu, Arg965Glu, and Arg1167Glu) destabilized the SARS-CoV S2 L2H six-helix bundle to a similar extent (DT m < 8 C). Double and triple charge reversal mutations (Lys929Glu-Arg965Glu, Arg965Glu-Arg1167Glu, and Lys929Glu-Arg965Glu-Arg1167-Glu) resulted in an additive reduction in stability (DT m 13 C); however, the changes were still modest [ Fig. 3 (C); Table II ]. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that salt bridges play a small role on the SARS-CoV S2 fusion core stability.",

            "text": "Hydrophobic residues are important for postfusion stability Given our findings that electrostatic interactions play only a minor role in the stability of the SARS-CoV S2 L2H fusion subunit, we focused on the role of the hydrophobic residues in maintaining structural integrity. The postfusion structure of SARS-CoV S2 reveals a series of hydrophobic residues positioned at the interface of the HR1-tether (Leu1148 and Ile1151) and HR1-HR2 (Ile1161, Leu1168, and Leu1175) [ Fig. 4(A) ]. We hypothesized that the hydrophobic interactions between the HR1-tether and HR1-HR2 regions play an essential role in stabilizing the outer layer (HR2 and tether) to the inner core (HR1) in the postfusion state. To test our hypothesis, we mutated all five hydrophobic residues to an alanine residue and performed CD thermal denaturation assays. Mutations to hydrophobes at the HR1-tether interface (Leu1148Ala and Ile1151Ala) destabilized SARS-CoV S2 L2H on the order of DT m 10 C [ Fig. 4 (B); Table II ]. Strikingly, alanine mutations to the hydrophobic residues at the HR1-HR2 interface (Ile1161Ala, Leu1168Ala, and Leu1175Ala) had drastic effects on protein stability, with >20 C decrease each on the apparent T m , as compared with WT SARS-CoV S2 L2H. Specifically, a single alanine mutation to Leu1168 or Leu1175 residue led to a approximately 30 C decrease on the melting temperature of SARS-CoV S2 L2H [ Fig. 4(B) ; Table II ]. Our results indicate that hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2, specifically Leu1168 and Leu1175, are critical for the stability of postfusion SARS-CoV S2. The hydrophobic HR2 residues involved in postfusion stability are well conserved across the coronavirus family (Fig. 5) .",

[37] [38] [39] The SARS-CoV S2 extramembrane helical fusion core contains two chloride-binding sites 30 [Fig. 4(C) ]. The first chloride-binding site of HR1 is located at the membrane-proximal end of the protein and is coordinated by Gln902, whereas the second site is at the center of the trimeric HR1 coiled coil and is coordinated by Asn937. In order to investigate the significance of these chloride-binding sites, we mutated both Gln902 and Asn937 to an alanine residue and monitored the changes on the stability of the protein. Table II ]. Thermal unfolding of the Gln902Ala-Asn937Ala double mutant revealed an additive effect in the change of melting temperature (DT m 5 23 C). As a control, we mutated an asparagine residue (Asn951) located outside of the chloridebinding sites and assessed its contribution on postfusion stability. As expected, Asn951Ala did not result in a change on the apparent T m value [ Fig. 4(D) ; Table II ]. Taken together, this suggests that conserved polar interactions with the chloride ion, in particular the central chloride-binding site, are important for the postfusion stability of the protein.",

            "text": "All class I viral glycoproteins, including those from coronaviruses, utilize a similar mechanism of fusion, in which structural rearrangements of two highly conserved heptad repeats juxtapose the viral and host cell membranes to form the fusion pore. The conformational changes necessary for membrane fusion requires the formation of an energetically stable six-helix bundle structure in the postfusion state. The transition from the higher energy metastable prefusion to the lower energy six-helix bundle postfusion conformation provides the energetics for fusion. Recently, it was suggested that the stability of the postfusion subunit is highest at the pH of the environment of where fusion occurs. 40, 41 For example, human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) fuses at the host plasma membrane at neutral pH. The HTLV-1 gp21 fusion subunit is most stable at pH values above 7.0 (61.0 C at pH 5.0 vs. >99.0 C at pH 7.5). 41 Ebola virus fusion occurs at the endolysosome, and its GP 2 subunit is most stable at pH values below 5.5 (86.8 C at pH 5.3 vs. 49.8 C at pH 6.1). 40 The observation that the stability of the fusion subunit mimics the environment where they fuse also holds true for avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV). ASLV is a retrovirus that undergoes a unique two-step entry mechanism that involves first receptor-binding at the plasma membrane, followed by low pH activation in the endosome. 17 The ASLV TM fusion protein is stable over a broad range of pH values (67.0 C-73.8 C at pH values between 5.0 and 8.5). 41 Although SARS-CoV does not undergo a twostep mechanism of entry, SARS-CoV entry may be promiscuous as it is able to enter target cells through either a low pH endosomal route or direct fusion at the plasma membrane at neutral The zoomed views of ion-pairs are shown in the inset boxes and the distances between the residues are indicated in \u00c5 ngstroms (\u00c5 ). (B) Thermal denaturation profiles of wild-type (WT), single, (C) double and triple mutant of electrostatic residues in the SARS-CoV S2 fusion subunit. Thermal stability was recorded at 222 nm.

Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), HTLV-1, and xenotropic murine leukemia virusrelated virus (XMRV) belong to the b-, d-, and gretrovirus genus, respectively, and fuse at the plasma membrane in a pH-independent entry process. 44, 45 Crystal structures of HTLV-1, MPMV, and XMRV transmembrane fusion protein domains identified a series of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the HR1 and HR2 regions. 38, 46 Mutations to the negatively and positively charged residues result in a significant decrease in the stability of the postfusion glycoprotein structure and decrease viral infectivity, suggesting a major role for salt bridges in stabilizing the postfusion six-helix bundle. 46, 47 Electrostatic interactions may be a common strategy used by viruses to stabilize the fusion protein at the plasma membrane. In ASLV, which has been used extensively as a model virus for both pH-dependent and pH-independent entry, the fusion domain crystal structure also revealed a lining of electrostatic salt bridges. However, these electrostatic interactions do not play a major role in stabilizing the six-helix bundle, as they do in fusion proteins of retroviruses with pH-independent entry. Instead, hydrophobic residues in the ASLV fusion protein play a large role in stabilizing the postfusion state. 41 The use of hydrophobic residues for stabilization is consistent with ASLV's mode of entry requiring low pH, 41 as the strength of hydrophobic interactions are not affected by pH changes in the environment. Other class I viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which solely enter host cells through low pH endosomes, also contain both ionic and hydrophobic interactions within their fusion core in the postfusion state. 48, 49 It is not clear whether the ionic residues are important for stability, as no studies have been performed on proteins from these viruses. Like ASLV, these viruses may utilize hydrophobic interactions as their primary mechanism for maintaining postfusion stability within the endosomes.",

On the flip side, electrostatic interactions are important to viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane at neutral pH. SARS-CoV is able to enter through direct fusion at the plasma membrane and the low pH environment of the endosome; therefore, we expected that the fusion subunit would have structural features typical of both types of viral fusion proteins. Our biophysical study on the linked SARS-CoV S2 now provides additional evidence to support this hypothesis. Salt bridge interactions in SARS-CoV S2 play a minor role in stabilizing the six-helix bundle. Moreover, the lack of a role for salt bridges is supported by the poor conservation of some salt bridge residues (i.e., Glu918-Arg1167) in all CoVs.",

CoV S2 plays an indispensable role in catalyzing the fusion of the virus and host lipid bilayers and residues involved in fusion are relatively well conserved across all family members (Fig.  5) . Targeting the viral fusion subunit is a proven strategy, as demonstrated by the efficacy of the FDA-approved HIV-1 gp41 HR2 mimic enfuvirtide (T-20). 58-60 SARS-CoV S2 HR2 peptides are also effective entry inhibitors based on pseudovirus and cell-cell fusion assays. 32, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] The peptides have traditionally been designed blindly by systematic addition of residues to the core HR2 region. Based on our biophysical fusion protein stability data, we are able to rationalize the trends of effectiveness of peptides. Our thermal denaturation data clearly shows that Ile1161, Leu1168, and Leu1175 are critical to the stability of the postfusion six-helix bundle structure, whereas hydrophobic residues that belong to the tether region have modest effects on stability. Hydrophobic residues at the C-terminal end of the HR2 region are more critical to the stability of the postfusion state than those at the tether region. The importance of these residues correlates well with the SARS-CoV HR2 peptide inhibition studies 35, 43, 61, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] (Table III) . Peptides that encompass the HR2 hydrophobic residues (Ile1161, Leu1168, and Leu1175) and those corresponding to the HR2 Cterminal ends had better IC 50 values than other peptides tested. Peptides that contain residues from the N-terminal tether region were less effective. Our data suggest that effective SARS-CoV HR2 peptide inhibitors should encompass the HR2 region and residues C-terminal to HR2.",

Analysis of available coronavirus S2 structures revealed strong structural conservation of the HR1 region that interacts with the key hydrophobic HR2 residues. Superimposition of a 42-residue HR1 region surrounding the HR2 binding site reveals an average RMSD of 0.4 \u00c5 between the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, MHV, and hCoV-NL63 S2 fusion subunits [ Fig. 6(A) ]. This is in contrast to an overall superimposition of the entire SARS-CoV, hCoV-NL63, and MERS-CoV, MHV S2 inner HR1 trimeric structures which showed C a atom RMSDs of 1.3, 0.6, and 0.6 \u00c5 , respectively.

The rim of the pocket is surrounded with polar (glutamine and asparagine) and hydrophobic residues (leucine, isoleucine, serine, and alanine) whereas the bottom of the pocket is lined with isoleucine residues [ Fig. 6(B) ]. HR2 residues that pack into the HR1 pocket are conserved in all fusion core structures with the exception of a conservative isoleucine substitution (Ile1279) in the hCoV-NL63 fusion core for the leucine in MHV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV S2 (Fig. 5) .

The DNA corresponding to a linked two-helix (L2H) SARS-CoV S2 fusion core, containing HR1 residues 896-973 and HR2 residues 1142-1183 connected with a Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser linker, was cloned into pET-46 Ek/LIC (EMD Millipore). A Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis-based protocol was used to generate the following single- Expression and purification of the SARS-CoV S2 linked core Plasmids containing SARS-CoV S2 L2H WT and mutants were transformed into the E. coli SHuffle T7 expression cell line (New England Biolabs). A single colony was inoculated into LB media supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 C. About 20 mL of the overnight culture was then used to inoculate 1 L of LB media supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin, and grown to OD 600 of 0.6 at 37 C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl b-D21-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The temperature was lowered to 18 C and harvested 18 hours post-induction by centrifugation at 3000g. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 25 mL 13 Ni-NTA binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS and 13 EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Bioshop). A hydraulic cell disruption system (Constant Systems) was used to lyse the homogenized cell suspension at 30 kpsi, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 36,500g for 45 min at 4 C. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 2 mL Ni-NTA column (Thermo Pierce), and washed with 10 bed volumes of 13 Ni-NTA binding buffer. The SARS-CoV S2 L2H protein was eluted in sequential steps using increasing concentrations of imidazole (125 mM imidazole, 250 mM imidazole, 375 mM imidazole, or 500 mM imidazole in . The eluted SARS-CoV S2 L2H protein was then concentrated and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a prep grade Superdex-75 10/300 column equilibrated with 10 mM K 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS. Protein concentration was quantified by absorbance at 280 nm, and protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry.",

Five spectra were acquired and averaged, with the results reported as molar ellipticity [h] (units of deg cm 2 dmol 21 ). The a-helical content of wild-type SARS-CoV S2 L2H was calculated from the experimental CD wavelength scans using the SELCON3 algorithm in the program DichroWeb. 71 Thermal denaturation scans. The relative thermal stabilities of SARS-CoV S2 L2H mutants were performed by heating the sample from 20 C to 99 C at 0.2 C intervals and monitoring the loss of CD signal at 222 nm. Heating alone was insufficient to denature the predominantly helical SARS-CoV S2 L2H fusion core. Similar to previous studies, 72 4M guanidine hydrochloride was added to all samples to facilitate unfolding within a temperature range of 20 C-99 C. Ellipticity readings for thermal denaturation data were baseline corrected, normalized between 0 (folded) and 1 (unfolded) and fit to a nonlinear biphasic sigmoidal curve in Graphpad. Values of midpoint unfolding transitions (T m ) were calculated from thermal melt curves and they correspond to the temperature where 50% of the protein has unfolded. pH scans. In order to study the effects of pH on the stability of the SARS-CoV S2 L2H fusion core, the purified proteins were buffer exchanged using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa molecular weight cut off) into the following buffer conditions: pH 4.0-6.5, sodium acetate (NaOAc) buffer (10 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS); pH 7.0-8.5, Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS). CD wavelength scans and thermal melts as a function of pH were performed as described above. The pH may exhibit fluctuations within the buffering range during the CD thermal melt experiments due to temperature-dependent phenomenon of the buffer.",

Red arrows indicate the S1-S2 and S 0 proteolytic cleavage sites at residues R667 and R797, respectively. SARS-CoV S2 L2H construct was generated by using HR1 residues 896-972 and tether/HR2 residues 1142-1183 connected by a six amino acid linker at the HR1 C-terminal and HR2 N-terminal ends (colored in orange). (B) Sedimentation equilibrium data for a 20 lM sample at 4 C and 22,000 rpm in TBS buffer. The curve indicates the distribution of a 48.4-kDa protein. The data fit closely to a trimeric model for SARS-CoV S2 L2H. The deviation in the data from the linear fit for a trimeric model is plotted in the upper panel. (C) Experimental CD wavelength scan of SARS-CoV S2 L2H (blue) at 25 C reveals minimas at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of strong ahelical secondary structural characteristics.
