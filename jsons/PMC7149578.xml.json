Deaths from measles are due largely to an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial and viral infections, attributed to a prolonged state of immune suppression. Despite the development of an effective attenuated vaccine, measles remains a leading vaccine-preventable cause of childhood mortality worldwide, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia, and continues to cause outbreaks in communities with low vaccination coverage rates in industrialized nations.",

Other members of the Morbillivirus genus are rinderpest virus and canine distemper virus. Although RNA viruses have high mutation rates, measles virus is an antigenically monotypic virus, meaning that the surface proteins responsible for inducing protective immunity have retained their antigenic structure. The public health significance is that measles vaccines developed decades ago from a single measles virus strain remain protective worldwide. Measles virus is killed by ultraviolet light and heat. Attenuated measles vaccine viruses retain these characteristics, necessitating a cold chain for transportation and storage.",

CD46 is a complement regulatory molecule expressed on all nucleated cells in humans. SLAM, an acronym for signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. The binding sites on H for these receptors overlap and strains of measles virus differ in the efficiency with which each is used. Wild-type measles virus binds to cells primarily through the cellular receptor SLAM whereas most vaccine strains bind to CD46; however, most measles virus strains can use both CD46 and SLAM as receptors during acute infection (Schneider et al., 2002). Additional, as yet unidentified receptors for measles virus exist on human endothelial and epithelial cells (Andres et al., 2003).",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes 8 clades of measles virus (designated A through H) and 23 genotypes (World Health Organization, 2006). New genotypes likely will be identified with enhanced surveillance and molecular characterization. As measles control efforts intensify, molecular surveillance of circulating measles virus strains can be used to document interruption of measles virus transmission and to identify the source and transmission pathways of measles virus outbreaks (Rota and Bellini, 2003). Molecular epidemiologic tools also would be important in documenting deliberate bioterrorist introductions of wild-type or genetically modified measles virus strains.",

The early nonspecific (innate) immune responses that occur during the prodromal phase of the illness include activation of natural killer (NK) cells and production of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2. These innate immune responses contribute to the control of measles virus replication before the onset of more specific adaptive immune responses. The protective efficacy of antibodies to measles virus is illustrated by the immunity conferred to infants from passively acquired maternal antibodies and the protection of exposed, susceptible individuals following administration of antimeasles virus immune globulin (Black and Yannet, 1960). The first measles virus-specific antibodies produced after infection are of the IgM subtype, followed by a switch to predominantly IgG3 and then to IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes (Isa et al., 2002). IgA antibodies to measles virus are found in mucosal secretions. The most abundant and rapidly produced antibodies are against N, and the absence of antibodies to N is the best indicator of seronegativity to measles virus. Antibodies to H and F proteins contribute to virus neutralization and are sufficient to provide protection against measles virus infection.",

Monkeys depleted of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and challenged with wild-type measles virus had a more extensive rash, higher measles virus loads, and longer duration of viremia than control animals, further confirming the importance of cellular immunity in measles virus clearance (Permar et al., 2003). CD4+ T-lymphocytes also are activated in response to measles virus infection and secrete cytokines capable of modulating the humoral and cellular immune responses. Plasma cytokine profiles show increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 during the acute phase, followed by a shift to high levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 during convalescence (Moss et al., 2002). The initial predominant Th1 response (characterized by IFN-\u03b3) is presumed to be essential for viral clearance, while the later Th2 response (characterized by IL-4) promotes the development of measles virus-specific antibodies.",

An active transport mechanism in the placenta is responsible for the transfer of IgG antibodies from the maternal circulation to the fetus starting at about 28 weeks gestation and continuing until birth (Crowe, 2001). Three factors determine the degree and duration of protection in the newborn: (1) the level of maternal antimeasles antibodies; (2) the efficiency of placental transfer; and (3) the rate of catabolism in the child. Although providing passive immunity to young infants, maternally acquired antibodies can interfere with the immune responses to the attenuated measles vaccine by inhibiting replication of vaccine virus. In general, maternally acquired antibodies are no longer present in the majority of children by 9 months of age, the time of routine measles vaccination in many countries. Women with vaccine-induced immunity tend to have lower antimeasles virus antibody titers than women with naturally acquired immunity, and their children may be susceptible to measles at an earlier age.\n",

Measles cases continue to occur during the interepidemic period in densely populated communities but at low incidence. The longer cycles occurring every several years result from the accumulation of susceptible persons over successive birth cohorts and the subsequent decline in the number of susceptibles following an outbreak. In the absence of a vaccination program these longer epidemic cycles tend to occur every 2\u20134 years.

During the 10\u201314 day incubation period between infection and the onset of clinical signs and symptoms, measles virus replicates and spreads within the infected host. Initial viral replication occurs in epithelial cells at the portal of entry in the upper respiratory tract and the virus then spreads to local lymphatic tissue. Replication in local lymph nodes is followed by viremia (the presence of virus in the blood) and the dissemination of measles virus to many organs, including lymph nodes, skin, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and liver, where the virus replicates in epithelial and endothelial cells as well as monocytes and macrophages.",

Evidence of these processes can be detected. During the incubation period, the number of circulating lymphocytes is reduced (lymphopenia) (Auwaerter et al., 1999). Measles virus can be isolated from the nasopharynx and blood during the later part of the incubation period and during the several days prior to the onset of rash when levels of viremia are highest. The prodrome ends with the appearance of the measles rash. The rash results from measles virus-specific cellular immune responses and marks the beginning of viral clearance from blood and tissue. Histologic examination of the rash reveals infected capillary endothelial cells and a mononuclear cell infiltrate (Kimura et al., 1975). Clearance of infectious virus from the blood and other tissues occurs within the first week after the appearance of the rash, although measles virus RNA can be detected in body fluids of some children for at least several months using a RT-PCR-based assay (Permar et al., 2001; Riddell et al., 2007).",

Transient lymphopenia with a reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes occurs in children following measles virus infection. Functional abnormalities of immune cells have also been detected, including decreased lymphocyte proliferative responses (Hirsch et al., 1984). Dendritic cells, major antigen-presenting cells, mature poorly, lose the ability to stimulate proliferative responses in lymphocytes, and undergo cell death when infected with measles virus in vitro (Servet-Delprat et al., 2000). The dominant Th2 response in children recovering from measles can inhibit Th1 responses and increase susceptibility to intracellular pathogens (Griffin et al., 1985; Griffin and Ward, 1993). The production of IL-12, important for the generation of Th1-type immune response, decreases following binding of the CD46 receptor (Karp et al., 1996) and is low for several weeks in children with measles (Atabani et al., 2001). This diminished ability to produce IL-12 could further result in a limited Th1 immune response to other pathogens. Furthermore, engagement of CD46 and CD3 on monocytes induces production of high levels of IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, an immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive cytokine profile characteristic of regulatory T cells (Kemper et al., 2003). The role of these cytokines in the immune suppression following measles is supported by in vivo evidence of elevated levels of IL-10 in the plasma of children after measles virus infection (Moss et al., 2002).",

The Schwarz and Moraten (more attenuated) strains were derived from the original Edmonston strain but further attenuated through additional passage in chick embryo fibroblasts. Despite differences in their passage history, these vaccine strains have identical genomic sequences (Parks et al., 2001). The Moraten vaccine (Merck) is the only measles vaccine used in the United States, whereas the Schwarz vaccine is used in many countries throughout the world. Other attenuated measles vaccines have been produced from locally derived wild-type strains, particularly in Russia, China, and Japan. One vaccine strain, the Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine, was also passaged in human diploid cells after attenuation in chick embryo fibroblasts, which may account for its increased immunogenicity and reactogenicity.

The optimal age of measles vaccination is determined by consideration of the age-dependent increase in seroconversion rates following measles vaccination and the average age of infection. In regions of intense measles virus transmission, the average age of infection is low and the optimal strategy is to vaccinate against measles as young as possible. However, both maternally acquired antibodies and immunologic immaturity reduce the protective efficacy of measles vaccination in early infancy (Gans et al., 1998). In many parts of the world, 9 months is considered the optimal age of measles vaccination (Halsey, 1983), and is the age recommended by the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Most countries following the EPI schedule administer measles vaccine alone, although more countries are introducing combined measles and rubella vaccines as rubella control programs expand. Under some circumstances, provision of an early dose of measles vaccine at 6 months of age (e.g., in outbreaks or to HIV-infected children) is appropriate. In regions that have achieved measles control or elimination, where the risk of measles in infants is low, the age of measles vaccination is increased to ensure that a higher proportion of children develop protective immunity. For example, in the United States the first dose of measles vaccine is administered at 12\u201315 months of age, as the combined MMR vaccine.",

The events that followed, and the public concern over the safety of MMR vaccine, led to diminished vaccine coverage in the United Kingdom and provide important lessons in the misinterpretation of epidemiologic evidence and the communication of scientific results to the public (Offit and Coffin, 2003). The publication that incited the concern was a case series describing 12 children with a regressive developmental disorder and chronic enterocolitis. Nine of the children had autism. Onset of the developmental delay was associated by the parents with MMR vaccination in eight children. This simple temporal association was misinterpreted and misrepresented as a possible causal relationship, first by the lead author of the study and then by the media and public. Subsequently, several comprehensive reviews and additional epidemiological studies rejected evidence of a causal relationship between MMR vaccination and autism (DeStefano and Thompson, 2004). One of the most conclusive studies was a large retrospective cohort study of over half a million Danish children that found the relative risk of MMR vaccine for autistic disorder to be 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.68\u20131.24) (Madsen et al., 2002).",

A different construct, containing H, F, and N genes and an IL-2 molecular adjuvant, provided protection to infant macaques in the presence of neutralizing antibody (Premenko-Lanier et al., 2003, Premenko-Lanier et al., 2004). Alternative techniques for administering measles DNA, such as alphavirus (Pan et al., 2005), parainfluenza virus (Skiadopoulos et al., 2001), or enteric bacterial (Pasetti et al., 2003) vectors, also are under investigation. Immune responses to intranasal administration of measles virus vaccines is enhanced by the use of adjuvants (Chabot et al., 2005). Novel oral immunization strategies have been developed using plant-based expression of the measles virus H protein in tobacco (Webster et al., 2005). These vaccines induced humoral immune responses following both primary immunization and as a booster dose after a DNA prime. In addition, attenuated recombinant measles virus vaccines have been used as vectors for the delivery of genes from other pathogens (Tangy and Naim, 2005).",

Measles virus meets many of the biologic criteria for disease eradication (Moss and Griffin, 2006). Measles virus has no nonhuman reservoir; infection can be accurately diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Although measles virus displays sufficient genetic variability to conduct molecular epidemiologic analyses, the antigenic epitopes against which protective antibodies develop have remained stable.

Whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication is a topic of debate, but, at the least, a single-dose rather than a two-dose measles vaccination strategy could be adopted (Meissner et al., 2004). The elimination of endemic measles virus transmission in large geographic areas, such as the Americas, suggests that global eradication is feasible with current vaccination strategies (de Quadros, 2004). Many believe this to be a realistic and morally imperative goal, but, as polio eradication efforts have shown, the endgame may be full of challenges.",
