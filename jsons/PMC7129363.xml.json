Especially in antiviral immunity, a number of TRIM proteins have been elucidated to exert crucial roles in response to virus infection recently [3], [4]. Knockdown of TRIM15 decreased retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) induced interferon production and enhanced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication [5]. Overexpression of TRIM4 potentiated virus-triggered activation of interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3 and IFN-\u03b2 induction, and finally mildly inhibited VSV replication [6]. Moreover, several TRIM proteins were proposed to restrict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or murine leukemia viruses (MLV) replication upon overexpression in vitro\n[3], [5], [7]. In addition to the antiviral activity to RNA virus, TRIM21 and TRIM5\u03b1 were also found to exert their antiviral roles against DNA viruses [8].",

TRIM13 was firstly demonstrated to act as a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase and play critical roles in ER-associated degradation [9]. Further studies showed that TRIM13 regulated the translocation of caspase-8 to autophagosome and its fusion with lysosome during ER stress [10]. Furthermore, TRIM13 was able to interact with NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO) and modulate its ubiquitination which may regulate IKK complex activity [11]. In addition, TRIM13 not only interacted with both melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I in vitro, but also functioned as a negative regulator of MDA5-mediated type I IFN production and abolished the resistance against a lethal challenge with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [12]. Although great progresses have been made in the function of mammalian TRIM13s, no information about fish TRIM13 was available.",

Our previous studies demonstrated several grouper TRIM genes were involved in grouper iridovirus infection.

In contrast, overexpression of TRIM38 or TRIM11 in vitro resulted in enhanced replication of VSV [28], [29]. In our study, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 significantly enhanced RGNNV replication, evidenced by the increase of CPE progression and viral gene transcription. Moreover, the deletion of RING domain significantly weakened the enhancing effect of EcTRIM13 on virus replication.

            "text": "Based on the regulatory effects of TRIM proteins on virus replication, further studies explored the multiple molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between TRIM proteins and other signaling molecules or their downstream events [6], [27], [29], [30]. Ectopic expression of TRIM11 decreased IFN\u03b2 promoter activity induced by the overexpression of RIG-I, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), or TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1). Moreover, TRIM11 overexpression inhibited the phosphorylation of IRF3 and mRNA expression of IFN\u03b2 [29]. In addition, TRIM13 was found to interact with both MDA5 and RIG-I in vitro, and negatively regulate MDA5-mediated type I IFN production [12]. In this study, our results indicated that overexpression of EcTRIM13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by IRF3, IRF7 and MDA5, but also decreased the expression of interferon related genes, including IRF3, IRF7, LGP2, MXI, MDA5, and ISG15. In addition, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 differently regulated the expression of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. Thus, we proposed that EcTRIM13 not only functioned as a negative regulator of IFN response in the innate antiviral immunity, but also regulated the inflammation response against virus infection. Combined with our previous studies identifying IRF3, MDA5, and ISG15 as antiviral factors against RGNNV infection [20], [31], [32], we speculated that the negative regulation of interferon immune response by EcTRIM13 might contribute directly to the enhancing effect on RGNNV replication.",
