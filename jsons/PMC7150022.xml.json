A single nucleic acid type \u2013 either DNA or RNA; single- or double-stranded \u2013 contains all the information needed. The genome is packaged in a protein coat, which in some viruses is further enclosed by a lipid envelope. All parts of the central and peripheral nervous system, even arteries and muscles, may be the target of viral pathogens. Importantly, besides the classic diseases, viruses may behave differently under immunosuppression or in immunocompromised states, potentially leading to more acute or progressive disease.

The relationship between the host and the agent is of major importance and factors influencing the spread and epidemiology are listed in Table 12.1\n(Mandell et al., 2010). How the virus spreads is another important determinant for its epidemiology: directly by respiratory droplets, kissing, touching, sexual intercourse, or through animal bites. Alternatively, it may be spread via vehicle transmission through an intermediate, e.g., by food, water, blood, or urine or as in vector-borne infections by mechanical spread. Echovirus, enterovirus, measles, mumps, coxsackievirus, herpesvirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and papovavirus are found in most areas of the world. Viruses transmitted by a vector are usually geographically limited to the vector's host environment: mosquitos or ticks show a clear-cut regional or continental occurrence (e.g., West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus). Some viruses today only exist in very circumscribed areas due to eradication efforts (e.g., poliomyelitis virus, smallpox) (Duintjer Tebbens et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The penetration of the CNS is achieved by several mechanisms (Craighead, 2000, Thompson and Green, 2012). Commonly, replication occurs outside the CNS and invasion by hematogenous spread (enterovirus). Via the vascular route, viral particles pass across the blood\u2013brain barrier, or cross into the brain via infected leukocytes (e.g., mumps, measles, or herpesviruses). Other viruses probably invade through peripheral nerves (rabies). The invasion and spread of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the CNS are probably mediated by the latent virus in the ganglion but there is room for speculation if the encephalitis is not due to a primary HSV infection (Steiner et al., 2007, Steiner, 2011, Steiner, 2012). Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mutations seem to be responsible for the failed immune response to prevent the invasion of HSV in some herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) patients (Lim et al., 2014, M\u00f8rk et al., 2015). Once within the CNS, viruses spread through the subarachnoid space, leading to an inflammatory response. Then, inflammatory cells (lymphocytes) specifically targeting the infecting virus accumulate in the CNS. This is accompanied by the release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 as well as local immunoglobulin production by plasma cells (Kothur et al., 2016). Viruses such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) may cause disease through cerebral vasculitis, with immunocompetent patients usually developing a large-vessel vasculitis.",

Additional clinical features can help to distinguish common headaches (migraine, tension-type headache, etc.) from those possibly caused by a viral infection: photophobia and pain on eye movements. The general accuracy of the clinical signs is under debate (Khatib et al., 2017) and thus clinical suspicion has to be high and threshold low to perform necessary procedures (LP) excluding an infectious origin of the symptoms (McGill et al., 2017). As a rule of thumb, we recommend to our residents covering the emergency room to perform LP when any combination of at least two out of the three principal symptoms of meningitis exist (headache, fever, neck stiffness) and no other cause can be determined.",

            "text": "Viral meningitis in its pure form has a very good prognosis and mortality rates are trending towards zero, but the prognosis is dependent on additional spread of the viral infection to the brain (encephalitis), to the spinal cord (myelitis), or to nerve roots (radiculitis). Viruses causing aseptic meningitis are listed in Table 12.1 (Chadwick, 2005, Harvala and Simmonds, 2016, Nesher et al., 2016, McGill et al., 2017). The viral involvement of the meninges can involve the cortex and brain itself, leading to meningoencephalitis and encephalitis. By definition, encephalitis is the presence of an inflammatory process in the brain parenchyma associated with clinical evidence of brain dysfunction (Steiner et al., 2010). In many cases the association with fever, headache, and general malaise and brain dysfunction is conveyed as behavioral changes, confusion, focal neurologic deficits, somnolence, stupor, and epileptic seizures (focal and generalized). The dramatic clinical picture needs rapid identification, symptomatic support and treatment (antiepileptic drugs) and specific treatment when available (e.g., acyclovir). Long-term survival and morbidity depend on the host immune status, treatment administered, and on the virus itself. HSV-1, VZV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, mumps, measles, and enteroviruses are responsible for most cases of viral encephalitis in immunocompetent individuals (Jellinger, 2009, Stahl et al., 2011, Beckham et al., 2016) but other viruses are listed in Table 12.2\n. Additionally, a viral infection of the CNS can be limited to the spinal cord resulting in myelitis. More common in clinical practice than the direct invasion of the myelon by the virus is a postinfectious inflammation (transverse myelitis). The direct invasion of the gray matter in the myelon is typically seen with enterovirus infections (poliovirus) but has been described in West Nile Virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus.",

However, the sensitivity for brain changes by EEG makes it a useful tool to demonstrate cerebral involvement during the early state of the disease. Specific EEG features can however give clues as to the diagnosis: In HSE, in addition to background slowing, there is a temporary temporal focus showing periodic epileptiform discharges. The EEG in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) shows a typical generalized periodic EEG pattern repeating with intervals between 4 and 15 seconds and synchronized with myoclonus of the patient (Westmoreland, 1987, Gaspard et al., 2015, Martins and Palmini, 2015, Cag et al., 2016, Pessa et al., 2016, Saini et al., 2016). Due to the strong separation of blood and brain by the blood\u2013brain barrier, the peripheral blood results in viral meningitis and encephalitis can be normal or only slightly abnormal and nonspecific. Possible minor alterations of blood tests pointing to liver or kidney involvement can be found and are mostly due to a viral infection also of those peripheral organs (typically seen in Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections).",

Leukocytes (white blood cells) are elevated (mostly not above 250/\u03bcL). The differential diagnosis shows a predominance of lymphocytes but in early infection neutrophils can be present (Feigin and Shackelford, 1973, Whitley et al., 1989, Cunha, 2013). If the clinical presentation is highly suspicious for encephalitis, a spinal fluid analysis returning with only borderline elevated cells should be repeated as, especially in HSE, a normal CSF can be seen in the first hours of infection. This can cause a treatment delay, worsening the prognosis of the encephalitis or leading to an alternative wrong diagnosis (de Toledo et al., 2001, Benninger et al., 2013, Desena et al., 2014, Saraya et al., 2016). In HSE at least 10% have normal cell counts within a week of onset of illness, usually, but not always, increasing later (Koskiniemi et al., 1984). This has been also shown for enterovirus encephalitis and in one study 36% had CSF with normal protein and/or cell count (Tavakoli et al., 2008). CSF protein is usually mildly elevated (< 150 mg/dL) in viral encephalitis. In HSE it is normal in 50% of cases early in the illness (Koskiniemi et al., 1984). If a bloody tap is obtained through trauma at LP, the protein level should be adjusted down by 0.1 mg/dL for every 1000 red cells/\u03bcL (Dennett et al., 1991).",

Diagnosis using capture immunoassays to detect IgM antibody has proved useful for arbovirus diagnosis but has been extended nowadays to detect intrathecal IgM in mumps encephalitis, varicella-zoster encephalitis, HSE, and measles in SSPE (Sharief and Thompson, 1990). An IgM assay for St. Louis encephalitis virus and Wile Nile virus exists. The detection of IgM in serum alone is generally not sufficient to implicate the virus as the cause of a suspected encephalitis.

PCR offers the advantages of high sensitivity and specificity and this holds true for even very small amounts of viral DNA or RNA. The minimum volume of CSF needed is determined more by the nucleic acid extraction system than the amplification process itself, with a typical minimum extraction volume of 100\u2013300 \u03bcL. In CSF, nucleic acid is relatively stable. Stability is enhanced if mononuclear cells are present and DNA is stable up to 30 days even at room temperature; however, RNA is less stable and advised to be stored at low temperatures (\u201370\u00b0C) until PCR (Wiedbrauk and Cunningham, 1996). Especially HIV RNA seems to degrade rapidly and shows significant decline after 24 hours, making detection difficult. With storage at 4\u00b0C, however, there is no significant loss of HIV RNA by 96 hours (stability is enhanced in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma in comparison to serum) (Rotbart et al., 1985, Ginocchio et al., 1997, Ahmad et al., 1999).",

In HSE, the sensitivity is 96% and the specificity 99% when CSF is studied between 48 hours and 10 days from symptom onset. Thus, in the early hours often the first CSF analysis can be negative for HSV-1 and should be repeated if clinically suspected (Adler et al., 2011, Steiner, 2012, Kennedy and Steiner, 2013). A high viral load has been suggested in some, but not all studies, to be correlated with a worse outcome (Nahmias et al., 1982). On the other hand, no relationship between CSF viral load and severity of clinical symptoms or outcome was detected in 23 HSE patients (Revello et al., 1997). A long duration of genome detectability (> 20 days) is probably more important in predicting poor outcome than initial level (Schloss et al., 2009). Information on correlation between viral load and outcome is scarce in other encephalitides. The HIV viral load in CSF seems not to be correlated with the viral load in the blood and in late infection behaves as if in a separate compartment (with the possibility of different antiviral resistance patterns) (Stingele et al., 2001). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with HIV infection and JC polyomavirus load in the CSF is correlated with a shorter survival if not treated (Bossolasco et al., 2005).",

Following myelitis or encephalitis, more than 10% of patients suffer from severe neurologic deficits, e.g., seizures, para- or tetraplegia, cognitive deficits. Untreated HSV encephalitis has a mortality rate of 70% and makes initial treatment such an important prognostic indicator (Jouan et al., 2015). TLR3 is a pattern recognition receptor triggered by viral double-stranded RNA and leading to the activation of specific transcription factors, which stimulate the production of cytokines that induce a complex program of innate immune responses facilitating viral, including HSV, clearance. In children with genetic defects that shared the common feature of encoding proteins involved in TLR3 interferon signaling pathways, mutations in TLR3 were associated with recurrent HSE (Zhang et al., 2007, Lim et al., 2014, Steiner and Tyler, 2014). Whether the defect in the TLR3 receptor reduces inflammation-mediated epileptogenesis as shown in animal models needs to be established in future clinical studies (Benninger et al., 2014, Gross et al., 2017). Regarding autoimmune-mediated encephalitis, reports suggest that the most commonly recognized cause of antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis, anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis, may in some cases be triggered by and follow HSE (Armangue et al., 2013, Armangue et al., 2015). Thus, in the context of recurrent encephalitis following HSE, the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis has to be ruled out.",

            "text": "Bacterial invasion of the brain in meningitis and encephalitis is only one part of the pathogenesis. The inflammatory response triggered by the bacterial assault is tolerated by the brain and spinal cord very poorly, leading directly to damage of nervous tissue (Fitch et al., 1999, Hasbun et al., 2001). The inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the CSF has substantial clinical impact with associated morbidity and mortality (Koedel et al., 2002, Koedel et al., 2010a, Weisfelt et al., 2006). Death is the result of systemic and/or intracranial complications such as brain edema with cerebral or cerebellar herniation (Nau et al., 1999, Koedel et al., 2002, 2010a; Scheld et al., 2002). Neutrophils and cytokines migrating to the site of infection can prevent invading pathogens but the mechanisms used against the pathogen can be harmful to the host tissue. Experimentally it has been shown that the cell wall components of bacteria cause the production of a wide range of cytokines. These cytokines, such as interleukins and TNF-\u03b1, contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes in the CSF, to brain edema, blood\u2013brain barrier damage, and damage of cells within the CNS (Saukkonen et al., 1990, Sharief et al., 1992). The crossing of the blood\u2013brain barrier is a sophisticated mechanism (Coureuil et al., 2017) and viable bacteria cause meningeal inflammation via cell membrane components and induce clinical symptoms and even death in animal models (Weber and Tuomanen, 2007, Koedel et al., 2010b). The presence of cell wall components in the CSF was correlated with neurologic sequelae and mortality (Schneider et al., 1999). There is evidence that treatment of bacterial meningitis with antibiotics alone has the capability to increase CSF cytokine concentrations, most likely because antibiotic-induced bacterial lysis releases large amounts of harmful bacterial products into the CSF (Mustafa et al., 1989, Van Furth and Roord, 1996).",

In order to accomplish this difficult task, the level of suspicion cannot be high enough. As in most parts of medicine, the physician has to conjecture to initiate the right diagnostic steps due to missing signs and symptoms in a significant proportion of patients with bacterial meningitis. Classically, bacterial meningitis presents fulminantly with rapidly developing fever, altered consciousness, and headaches, but this classic triad is present in only 50% of all patients (van de Beek et al., 2004). As we described in the section on viral meningitis, headache, fever, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness should encourage the physician to consider bacterial meningitis until ruled out (present in 95% of patients). The commonly known signs of Kernig and Brudzinski have to be viewed with caution as their sensitivity (up to 95%) depends very much on the examiner and their specificity is rather low (~ 5%) (Sakushima et al., 2011). The differential diagnosis is broad (Table 12.4\n), but as the gold standard to rule out bacterial meningitis is the CSF investigation, we encourage its broad use after ruling out contraindications for LP. Helpful clinical additional signs should be identified by the medical exam: purpura fulminans is typical for meningococcal meningitis. Septicemia (Waterhouse\u2013Friderichsen syndrome) is seen in about 10% of patients with meningococcal meningitis: septic shock, hemorrhages leading to multiorgan failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Focal signs on neurologic examination are seen in about 10% of patients, suggestive for a brain abscess, stroke, or venous thrombosis (Alvis-Miranda and Castellar-Leones, 2013a, Alvis-Miranda and Castellar-Leones, 2013b). Seizures are present in up to 30% on presentation.",

With the elimination of DNA extraction, there is no DNA loss and thus, lower numbers of bacteria are detected compared to traditional rt-PCR, well within the range detected by culture (Wu et al., 2013, Bloch and Tang, 2016, Vuong et al., 2016).

In one study, out of 645 patients with bacterial meningitis 7% of patients did not have pleocytosis (van de Beek et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2014, Mentis et al., 2016). Furthermore, these two parameters have low discriminatory power between bacterial versus viral meningitis. Spanos et al.

Sensitivity and specificity were examined regarding bacterial meningitis and varied from 60% to 86% with specificity between 60% and 100%. In various studies, 1\u201310% of patients with bacterial meningitis had normal CSF protein concentration, while for 5\u201325% of patients with proven viral meningitis the protein level was significantly increased (Donald and Malan, 1986, Coll et al., 1994). The CSF glucose levels are dependent on serum glucose levels. The normal CSF:serum glucose ratio lies in the region of 0.6. The normal glucose level in CSF varies from 2.6 to 4.2 mmol/L. CSF glucose is low in several conditions of increased glucose consumption, depending on the amount of pleocytosis (Hegen et al., 2014). Glucose levels can be undetectable in bacterial meningitis and ratios below 0.4 are very indicative of bacterial origin of low CSF glucose. The sensitivity however is rather low and CSF glucose level performance remains inadequate for diagnosing bacterial meningitis. Durand et al. (1993) showed that only 50% of patients had a CSF glucose level of < 2.2 mmol/L. While bacterial meningitis probably is the most common diagnosis associated with hypoglycorrhachia, several studies showed low CSF glucose in only one-fourth of overall cases. One-third of hypoglycorrhachia episodes were associated with noninfectious causes such as strokes, carcinomatosis, lymphomatosis, and neurosarcoidosis. Subjects with a recent history of neurosurgery and hypoglycorrhachia most often had bacterial meningitis, while HIV-infected subjects with hypoglycorrhachia most often had fungal meningitis followed by cerebral toxoplasmosis and neurosyphilis. Surprisingly, the most common diagnoses associated with hypoglycorrhachia in subjects without HIV infection or neurosurgical history were noninfectious (Chow and Troy, 2014).",

Most fungi are found worldwide but a specific distribution is typical for C. immitis (Mexico, South America, and southwest United States) and Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is endemic in Africa and in continental North America. Histoplasma capsulatum is found in certain areas in Ohio, United States, and Latin America. Most fungal infections occur in immunocompromised hosts (Table 12.6\n); in addition patients with intact immune systems are being infected. Risk factors for particular fungal infections are known and include long-term antibiotic therapy and very young age in Candida infections, bird feces contamination for Cryptococcus and Histoplasma, ketoacidosis and renal failure in Zygomycetes (Black and Baden, 2007). Fungi are found in the ground and vegetations, on the skin of birds, and in bat feces. Fungal spores enter the body through inhalation into the lungs but CNS fungal infections are usually secondary to infections elsewhere in the body by hematogenous spread, most commonly from the lung. CNS invasion can be by direct extension from the adjacent structures: sinuses, nose, and ear canal. The brain is usually resistant to fungal infections and it needs special conditions to breach the protective blood\u2013brain barrier.",

About 5\u201310% of patients with HIV develop cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptoccoal meningitis usually has a subacute or chronic course. The most typical presentation is excruciating headaches without fever. Elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of ventricular dilatation may cause visual and hearing loss and on examination papilledema is found frequently (Gottfredsson and Perfect, 2000, Bicanic et al., 2009a, Bicanic et al., 2009b, Bicanic et al., 2012, Greene et al., 2017, McCarthy and Walsh, 2017).

Intracranial granuloma is seen more frequently with Aspergillus infections. Spread from the nasal sinuses can cause symptoms at the base of the skull (Sharma et al., 1997, Sundaram and Murthy, 2011, Naik et al., 2015).

In Cryptococcus neoformans a predominant lymphocytic pleocytosis is detected while monocytes and neutrophils are seen in Candida, Aspergillus, and blastomycosis meningitis (Saccente and Woods, 2010). Eosinophilia is relatively exclusive in Coccidioides infection. If the Candida meningitis is device-related (e.g., neurosurgical procedures) pleocytosis may be absent (S\u00e1nchez-Portocarrero et al., 2000, Satishchandra et al., 2007). Glucose is low with elevated CSF protein as typical finding. As with other opportunistic infections, HIV-positive patients may have fewer cells in the CSF then expected (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The cryptococcal organism is found by India ink preparations in more than 50% of HIV-negative patients and 90% of patients with AIDS (Black and Baden, 2007, Satishchandra et al., 2007). Antigen assays in the CSF show different sensitivities: Cryptococcus 90%, Histoplasma 38% (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2006, Opota et al., 2015). Although not commonly used, the cell wall component 1,3-beta-d-glucan can be used as a preliminary screening tool in the case of invasive fungal disease (negative in Zygomycetes).",

The majority of patients are found in low- and middle-income countries and correlate with the hygienic surrounding, but parasitic infections of the nervous system are being recognized in rising numbers also in the developed world due to international air travel and tourism, HIV infections, and posttransplant immune suppression. The parasites infecting the nervous system are divided into two groups depending on their cell number (Table 12.7\n): protozoa (Greek: protos \u201cfirst\u201d and zoion \u201canimal\u201d), a term coined by Georg August Goldfu\u00df describing parasites with only one cell (Langer, 1970), and metazoa (multicellular organisms) or helminthes. Pathophysiologically, multicellular helminthes have the ability to destroy tissue and cross physical barriers (e.g., skin), migrating and causing an inflammatory response, which is often eosinophilic. The protozoa on the other hand are mainly seen in immune-compromised hosts, explaining the fact that most of the severe opportunistic infections in patients with HIV are caused by protozoan parasites (Walker and Zunt, 2005). Some parasites regularly cause symptomatic disease, while others cause few, if any, symptoms. Regarding the CNS, the most common parasite is cysticercosis and only secondary in numbers echinococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and schistosomiasis. Vector-related parasites include malaria, onchocerciasis, toxocariasis, trypanosomiasis, and angiostrongyliasis and their occurrence is dependent on the geographic region (endemic areas).",

Most parasites upon their CNS infection lead to seizures or encephalopathy, eosinophilia (in blood or CSF), and fever. Neurocysticercosis most frequently is associated with headache, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures, depending on the location of the cysts (Carabin et al., 2011, Arora et al., 2017, Nash et al., 2017). Interestingly, it has been shown in intracranial electroencephalographic recordings that seizure onset does not necessarily correlate with the neurocysticercosis cyst location and in neurosurgical series of patients a robust association between neurocysticercosis and hippocampal sclerosis was shown, theorizing that hippocampal sclerosis could result from recurrent seizure activity due to a distant focus or from chronic recurrent inflammation (Del Brutto et al., 2016).",

The access to antiretroviral therapy is improving (~ 18.2 million) and remains the strongest and most important tool to fight AIDS (Fettig et al., 2014, UNAIDS, 2016). Two viral subtypes, HIV-1 and HIV-2, exist, of which HIV-1 is by far the most common. The improved efficacy of today's treatment has turned HIV into a chronic disease with life expectancy approaching population norms for patients who comply with an appropriate antiretroviral treatment (Teeraananchai et al., 2017). Despite the achievements in the management of HIV infection, the virus persists in the latency organs of the host for the host's entire life. Most obvious association with the CNS is via opportunistic infections, discussed above. Without antiretroviral treatment, the progressive decline of CD4 + cells leads to the development of CNS opportunistic infections (cryptococcosis, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis). Besides this, HIV enters the brain directly and is detectable in the CSF.",

HIV RNA has been found in CSF from patients regardless of CSF involvement, but the viral load in CSF is usually lower than in plasma. Virus load does not seem to correlate with the severity of the HIV-associated dementia nor with abnormal quantitative neurologic performance (Kaul, 2009). On the other hand, lower HIV DNA levels in monocytes are associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy initiation within the first year of infection, suggesting that the early commencement of highly active antiretroviral therapy may improve outcomes in HAND (Murray et al., 2012, Dahl et al., 2014). In recent studies a negative correlation of the amount of CSF interferon-\u03b1 and cognitive performance was found, strengthening the hypothesis that it is not direct viral infiltration but rather inflammatory responses that may be responsible for HAND (de Almeida et al., 2017). CSF pleocytosis, consisting mostly of lymphocytes and to a lesser extent of monocytes, is present early in the course of HIV infection even in neurologically asymptomatic subjects, suggesting that it is directly linked to HIV infection itself, rather than an undiagnosed opportunistic infection or neurologic complications (Ho et al., 2013).",

In HIV-positive individuals, it is important to note that CSF cell counts may not demonstrate lymphocytosis. Research suggests that large CSF volumes and longer microscopy examination times identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis using acid-fast stains with a sensitivity of 52%. CSF cultures on Lowenstein-Jensen medium are also effective in detecting M. tuberculosis in up to 90% of cases; however, this technique is severely limited due to result times of several weeks. DNA detection in CSF by PCR assay may be a useful ancillary diagnostic test, with a nearly 100% specificity but a sensitivity that varies between 30% and 50%, thus limiting its usefulness. Empiric therapy should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, as confirmatory testing is typically delayed.",

The risk of developing SSPE after childhood measles is estimated as 1/25,000 and vaccine coverage over 90% arrests the transmission of measles in a population and reduces markedly the incidence of SSPE. It is generally accepted that the measles virus (MV) can reach the brain by infecting circulating lymphocytes or endothelial cells. Transneuronal and axonal spread is also considered. Viral antigens are expressed and induce an anti-MV immune response. Cognitive changes can be subtle. Myoclonus is the most common and frequently the first symptom bringing the child to medical attention.",

Rare and less typical presentations of SSPE include epileptic seizures, epilepsia partialis continua, acute encephalopathy, hemiparesis, acute ataxia, unilateral dystonia, or psychiatric disturbances and dementia. CSF analysis, protein, and cell count are normal and pressure can be normal or, infrequently, elevated. Immunoglobulin index is high and oligoclonal bands reacting with MV antigens are seen in almost all patients. Antimeasles IgG and measles-specific IgG index are diagnostic. MV RNA can sometimes be detected by rt-PCR. No specific drug can clear the persistent MV from the CNS. Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments can achieve partial remission or stabilization rates exceeding those expected in the natural course (Steiner et al., 2014). Intraventricular interferon treatment has been shown to modify the course of SSPE and should be considered (Wirguin et al., 1988, Wirguin et al., 2005, Steiner et al., 2016).",

In 1991 Berger reported 3 patients in whom Mollaret's meningitis followed recrudescence of genital herpes. The attacks responded to acyclovir in 2 patients, and in 1 the disorder did not recur following treatment. Prior to the introduction of PCR technology, the possibility that the disorder was due to an HSV infection was intriguing because of the recurrent, self-limiting nature of the condition and because of the CSF findings, which were compatible with viral infection. Indeed, PCR made it possible to identify the etiology of the disease in most, if not all, patients and to attribute it either to HSV-2 (Picard et al., 1993, Cohen et al., 1994, Jensenius et al., 1998), or to HSV-1 in selected cases (Yamamoto et al., 1991, Tedder et al., 1994). Cohen et al. (1994) reported the identification of HSV-2 DNA in the CSF of patients with Mollaret's meningitis associated with the presence of Mollaret cells in the CSF.",
