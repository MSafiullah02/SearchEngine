The World Health Organization (WHO) was first informed in February 2003 by the Chinese Ministry of Health of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome involving 305 cases and five deaths that occurred in Southern China.1 A number of major outbreaks were then reported in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Toronto, Singapore and Taiwan. With an increasing number of reports of this unusual infection across Asia, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention termed this condition severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).2 The case definition of SARS is periodically updated. Based on clinical features, radiological and virological findings and a positive contact history, patients can be categorised into \u201csuspect\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d SARS cases.3\n",

SARS has shown its potential to spread rapidly across the globe. This new respiratory infection has been noted to be highly contagious. Household contacts and health care workers who cared for patients with this type of atypical pneumonia were particularly prone to acquiring it. The clinical presentation and progression are very different in children from those in adults. In this paper, we summarise current knowledge on the epidemiology, aetiology, clinical features, laboratory features and the experience in the treatment of SARS in children.",

It began when an infected doctor who had been treating patients with SARS in Mainland China came from Zhongshan county to Hong Kong in February 2003.4 He had stayed in the hotel in Hong Kong for just 2 days but many visitors and guests had by then already contracted the disease. These infected individuals from the index hotel returned to their home countries and initiated the SARS outbreaks in the hospital systems of Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Hanoi.5., 6., 7., 8. The clinical features of the infection and the route of spread were not well understood at the beginning of the outbreaks in early March. Health care workers become infected because they did not wear proper personal protective equipment while caring for the infected patients. The infection was subsequently brought outside the health care setting by hospital workers and visitors.",

Within 2 weeks, over 150 health care workers, medical students and the other patients as well as visitors to the index ward were infected.5 The use of a jet nebuliser in the index case is believed to have generated a large volume of infectious droplets. Following this case cluster, a major community outbreak occurred in a large apartment complex called Amoy Gardens. A patient on renal dialysis who contracted SARS when staying in the index ward visited his relatives at Amoy Gardens; over 300 people were subsequently infected.9 This outbreak was likely to have been caused by leaky sewage pipes that generated an aerosol that was contaminated with infectious faecal material. The floor drains of the bathrooms and kitchens were connected to the sewage pipes and a backflow of the infectious aerosol probably contributed to the spread of the infection within the apartment building. During this community outbreak, contacts and residents at the Amoy Gardens were put into quarantine to prevent the possible spread of SARS within the community.",

There has not been any spread of SARS in the school setting in Hong Kong despite the fact that many infected children were attending school until they developed symptoms of the infection. Massive public education and campaigns have, however, occurred via different channels of the mass media since late March 2003. Children were advised to stay at home if they had any fever or a respiratory tract infection. Schools were suspended in an attempt to limit the outbreak. Similar quarantine measures were also carried out in Mainland China. The experience in Guangzhou and Beijing was similar to that of Hong Kong, paediatric cases accounting for less than 5% of the total patient number.",

Although the virus can be detected in respiratory secretions, stools and urine using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), many (>50%) of our SARS patients with coronavirus infection confirmed by serology were initially negative on RT-PCR testing. The sensitivity of this rapid test depends on the types of specimen collected, the quality of the specimens and the timing of their collection.10., 16. Virus isolation can also be performed by co-culturing clinical specimens (stool, urine and respiratory secretions) with Vero cells. These procedures are, however, technically demanding and can only be carried out in specialised laboratories. Serum antibody testing using enzyme immunoassay and indirect fluorescence antibody assay have also been developed but SARS patients will not receive a positive result until the third week of their illness. These tests can therefore only be used to confirm the diagnosis later in the course of the illness.9., 12. A history of close contact with a known SARS patient remains the most important clue to alert paediatricians to a possible diagnosis of this infection. The identification of the genome sequence of this new coronavirus will facilitate the development of accurate rapid diagnostic tests, specific vaccines and other specific anti-viral agents.17., 18.\n",

Because of the generally mild symptoms, a history of household exposure of children to infected adults is the most important clue to the diagnosis of SARS. There has not been any documented spread of this infection from children to children or children to adults. Nevertheless, such potential cannot be ruled out as, in Hong Kong, all infected children were isolated from the onset of their illness. Prompt, early isolation is still mandatory until more information about the infectivity and viral shedding in children is available.",

In contrast to the aggressive regimens used for adults,24 only simple supportive care is needed in children with SARS as a majority of them do not become very ill. For more severely affected adolescents, treatment is largely based on the adult experience. Since there is no known specific anti-viral agent for the SARS-associated coronavirus, ribavirin has been widely used in treating adult cases in Hong Kong. As revealed by the autopsy results of fatal adult cases, the main pathological features in the lungs have been diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation and scanty interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates.4., 5. Epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration are other characteristic findings.26 It is believed that the lung damage is caused by immunopathological responses to the viral infection. Anecdotal early experience in adult patients suggested that the combination of systemic corticosteroid and ribavirin appeared to be effective in controlling the disease. Recent experimental data have, however, suggested that ribavirin might be ineffective against SARS-associated coronavirus.27 The use of corticosteroid with this possibly ineffective anti-viral agent in patients with coronavirus pneumonia can be detrimental. On the other hand, glycyrrhizin extracted from liquorice roots was found to be efficacious in vitro in inhibiting the replication of SARS-associated coronavirus.27\n",
