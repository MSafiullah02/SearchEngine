New viral infections continue to emerge in addition to the existing ones. Consequently, detection and identification of viral pathogens is of critical importance in disease control. Traditionally, virus identification is done by cultivation or serological methods [1], [2] in clinical laboratories. Most methods for viral disease diagnosis are geared toward detecting the presence of a particular virus. When a symptomatic patient of unknown etiology is presented, a number of different methods are often executed in parallel to reach a final diagnosis.",

The working principle of the method is shown in Fig. 1\n. RT-PCR amplification with multiple primer pairs for virus genetic element amplification is employed to enrich viral DNA targets and liquid hybridization facilitates efficient binding of the probes to their cognate viral targets. The probes corresponding to the genetic elements of viruses present in the specimen bind the viral DNA targets and are retained on magnetic beads by a biotin\u2013streptavidin pull-down mechanism. With capillary electrophoresis separation, the identities of the viruses in the specimens are unraveled by the retention time of the diminished peaks in the electropherogram. The high resolution DNA sequencer allows discrimination of probes differing by one base in length to facilitate identification of the pathogenic viruses from a multitude of candidate viruses. In order to automatically detect the diminished peaks to unravel the virus identities, an integrated signal processing algorithm is developed to align peaks, measure peak areas, and determine the identity of the viruses. This technical note demonstrates successful implementation of the above strategy with 9 viral isolates using widely available capillary electrophoresis instrument.",

These results were in accordance with the viruses we spiked in the test samples.

The peaks in the supernatant electropherogram serve as size markers to unravel the identity of the diminished peaks. On the other hand, the two standalone peaks in the bead electropherograms would require additional size markers labeled with a different fluorophore and run in the same capillary to unravel the identity of the probes if the bead electropherograms were to be used without the complementary supernatant electropherogram.

Parameters for peak detection were defined prior to the detection and included minimum peak height, minimum peak width, and sampling frequency. After peak detection, the peaks of the electropherogram were aligned with the blank control electropherogram containing peaks of the 15 virus probes. The aligned peaks were further attended to fit the first-order Gaussian distribution. By calculating the peak areas of the fitted curves, we are able to tell which peaks are diminished and unravel the identity of the corresponding viruses (refer to Supplementary Data for more details).

Depending on the coverage of viruses needed for an identity screen, the number of probes may be extended by a multi-channel capillary electrophoresis instrument to have more virus probes in one run. The number of probes can be increased by two ways, by labeling the probes with up to 4 different fluorophores and/or increase the number of probes of different lengths. The high resolution of capillary gel electrophoresis allowed discriminating probes difference in length by one base, e.g., the 64mer probe for SARS and the 65mer probe for DENV1. Therefore, it permits using tens of fluorescently labeled probes for virus identification. The number may go beyond a hundred if more than one fluorophores are used. The number of sample per run is limited by the capacity of the DNA sequencer and is up to 96 samples at a time with an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer.",

            "text": "It is known that samples run in different capillaries vary in migration time and signal intensity. With the aforementioned algorithm, we were able to align and adjust the retention time of the peaks. To assess the variation of peak area in different capillaries, we used a blank control and 7 different quantities of SARS virus ranging from 10 to 5000 copies of virus genome to go through the one-step RT-PCR process. The 8 samples were run in separate capillaries by the ABI 3100 genetic analyzer. The results are shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information. The peak area data fit virus quantity data on logarithmic scale with a coefficient of determination, r\n2\n = 0.97. The data present in the plot were performed in triplicates to determine the standard deviation. For 10 copies, the mean peak area was 175 and the standard deviation was 14; for 50 copies, the mean was 140 and the standard deviation was 6. By 95% confidence interval, i.e., with 1.96-fold standard deviation, the method is able to detect virus down to the order of 10 copies and resolve virus quantity by order of magnitude. Based on this quantification study and the PCR conditions described in Section 2, it took 105 copies of SARS virus to have completely diminished peak.",

            "text": "We have developed a rapid virus identification method with one-step RT-PCR, liquid hybridization, probe depletion, capillary electrophoresis, and signal processing algorithm for unraveling the identity of unknown viruses in test samples. The probe depletion approach allows more probes to be used for virus identity screen by abrogating the need for an additional fluorophore labeled size markers in each capillary. The method is applicable to both RNA viruses and DNA viruses, e.g., HAdV-C. Although the method is for unraveling virus identity rather than quantification, we determined that as low as 10 copies of virus may be sufficient for identification and the method has 4 orders of magnitude in dynamic range for SARS virus. The high resolution 4-color DNA sequencer and the signal processing algorithm allow discriminating probes that differ by one base in length and may permit virus identification from more candidate viruses than this research simultaneously in a time span of less than 1 h. With wide availability of capillary electrophoresis instruments, the technology described in this report is readily applicable in clinical laboratories for virus identification. The working principle and the procedural pipeline of the technology may be applied and integrated in miniaturized devices [15] for portable uses in the future.",
