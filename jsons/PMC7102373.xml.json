            "text": "America, as well as the industrialized world, is aging rapidly [1]. The population of elderly Americans nearly doubled from 19.1 million in 1966 to nearly 34 million in 1998, with this number expected to double by the year 2030 [2]. The \u201coldest old\u201d (\u226585 years) accounted for a mere 7 % of the population three decades ago yet now constitutes nearly 15 % by 2010 [3]. Older Americans consume health-care resources at a rate two to three times greater than younger adults due to the increasing prevalence of chronic disease among those of advanced age and other factors. The aforementioned trends are predictably impacting intensive care unit (ICU)s, as increasing numbers of elderly patients are admitted for both the exacerbation of chronic illnesses as well as the development of acute illnesses such as severe sepsis [3]. Currently, more than 75 % of all ICU days are incurred by elderly patients, and a typical ICU length of stay is 7 times greater for patients >75 than for those <65 [4]. While potentially debilitating to patients of all ages, the effects of critical illness and ICU hospitalization on elderly individuals may be particularly profound, with recent evidence suggesting that older patients are more likely than their younger counterparts to experience prolonged disability following hospitalization while also experiencing greater quality of life decrements [5\u20137]. Studies of acutely ill elderly suggest that cognitively intact patients may experience accelerated cognitive decline after general hospital treatment and that those with mild forms of cognitive impairment are at greater risk for adverse outcomes including increased mortality and permanent institutionalization [8, 9]. Consequently, the effort to understand cognitive impairment following critical illness as well as the degree to which functional disability is mediated by deficits in certain neuropsychological domains is a critically important goal and one with far-reaching public health implications. This goal can be facilitated through investigation of a particular type of cognitive dysfunction, widely known as executive dysfunction. In the view of thought leaders in the fields of geriatric medicine and neuropsychology, executive function is uniquely related to an array of functional disabilities in both elderly and nonelderly and which may be caused by specific mechanisms of injury common to critical illness as well as patients cared for in the ICU [10, 11]. In this article, we will discuss the risk factors, clinical outcomes, and potential treatment of cognitive impairment, with a particular focus on executive dysfunction, one of the many domains impacted by critical illness.",

            "text": "The presence of sustained respiratory distress of a severity typically requiring mechanical ventilation is one of the more universal experiences associated with critical illness [28\u2022\u2022]. Indeed, the incidence of mechanical ventilation is increasing, with patients \u226565 having the highest age-specific incidence [29]. Among mechanically ventilated patients, particularly those suffering from conditions such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), prolonged periods of hypoxemia and hypotension are common, with the most definitive study to date reporting that ARDS patients have an average of 25 episodes of desaturation <90 and 1 episode <85, for a duration of more than 2 h during a typical hospital stay [28\u2022\u2022]. Tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, is oxygen dependent, and decreased dopamine levels have been observed in brain tissue during prolonged periods of hypoxia [30]. As the brain engages in the process of adapting to hypoxia, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors become more excitable, in turn leading to oxidative cell death [31]. In patients with conditions that include prominent symptoms due to hypoxemia, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), executive deficits are prominent and include poor problem solving skills, impaired concept formation, and limited cognitive flexibility [12, 32\u201335]. These findings make sense in light of evidence that suggests that structures within the frontal circuits are particularly sensitive to hypoxia [35].",

These inflammatory responses are mediated by cytokines that penetrate the blood-brain barrier and directly or indirectly modulate brain activity, potentially altering neurotransmission [38]. While human investigations are ongoing, much of the evidence for an association between cytokines and neurocognitive function is derived from animal models, which demonstrate that high interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels occur in brain regions such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex [38, 39]. Neuropsychological dysfunction associated with inflammation includes impairments in elements of executive functioning including working memory, cognitive flexibility, and set shifting [40, 41]. Wide-ranging and persistent deficits in executive functioning, including abnormalities on tasks of working memory, verbal fluency, and planning/organization, have been observed in patients receiving interferon treatment and thus experiencing significant neuroinflammation, for conditions such as melanoma, leukemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, and chronic hepatitis [42\u201344].",

Additionally, 20 of these patients had problems with memory. The amount of difficulty with problem solving while in the ICU correlated with length of ICU stay (p = 0.011), age (p = 0.036), and length of hospital stay following the ICU (p = 0.004) [45\u2022\u2022]. Further, the finding by Jones and colleagues regarding age and executive dysfunction in ICU survivors is supported by substantial data from studies of humans and nonhuman primates alike that demonstrates that advanced age is a risk factor, with evidence suggesting that healthy subjects in their 70s and 80s, as well as even younger cohorts, frequently display executive deficits [46\u201349].",

Recent investigations employing sophisticated scanning technologies have demonstrated that delirium is associated with significant cerebral hypoperfusion in particular brain regions, including frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions [51]. Subcortical structures, which appear to mediate key elements of executive functioning, are particularly susceptible to even slight alternations in blood flow because of the small perforating vessels feeding these structures [52].

Delirium was the strongest independent predictor of cognitive impairment in 50 % of patients in this complication following critical illness. A Repeatable Battery for Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) score similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (2 standard deviations below the population mean) was found in 26 % of patients, and a score similar to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) (1.5 standard deviations below the population mean) was found in 40 % of patients 3 months after discharge.

The clinic is run by a nurse, an ICU consultant, for half a day twice monthly. Criteria for the clinic include an ICU stay of 2 least days. These patients are seen at 2, 6, and 12 months following discharge. Following the addition of several more clinics in the UK in subsequent years, a survey was conducted in 2006. ICUs were surveyed to determine the state of ICU follow-up clinics [89]. Thirty percent of the 266 ICUs that responded to the survey in the UK had a PICS clinic. The majority was nurse-led (55 %) and required an ICU length of stay of at least 3 to 4 days (77 %). Psychological and physical therapy was available in one third of the clinics surveyed. Australia also first established PICS clinics in the early 1990s as well [90].",

Four clinical trials have shown improvement on assessment scales evaluating memory and attention with utilization of donepezil [91]. However, these benefits are thought to be minor, short-lived, and linked to substantial side effects [92]. In general, these studies have pertained to individuals with mild cognitive impairment and early manifestations of dementia and have focused more on the remediation of memory deficits than executive dysfunction.\n",

It is hypothesized that improved spatial memory is seen in patients with cognitive impairment with a deficiency of testosterone only. Piribedil is a dopamine receptor agonist that has shown benefit in cognitive impairment. However, this agent is not currently available in the USA. Anti-inflammatory agents are also thought to potentially provide benefit in cognitive impairment. However, rofecoxib, the agent evaluated for this indication, has been removed from the market in the USA due to concerns about safety. Larger, more rigorously designed studies need to be conducted to further determine the efficacy of the utilization of neuropharmacotherapy in the treatment of cognitive impairment.",
