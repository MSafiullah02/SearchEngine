Worldwide a significant number of health care workers (HCWs) have been infected till to date with Asia-Pacific region reporting 35 deaths and over 4000 quarantined cases, as onApril 3, 2020.1 HCWs across the nation are anxious, unsure of personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, and whether it will provide enough protection or not. With alarming COVID-19 case numbers, an overlooked facet of the PPE scarcity is whether HCWs can use it properly without self-contamination. Effective use of PPE by HCWs is an integral part of COVID-19 prevention in the health care setting. WorldHealthOrganization recommendations emphasize the importance of appropriate use of PPE, which requires correct and rigorous behavior from health care workers, particularly while doffing.2 Hospitals are scrambling to efficiently train a large number of noncritical care staff at short notice through simulation, webinars, and online courses on proper PPE donning and doffing practices. But experience from past infectious outbreak highlights the higher self-contamination rates as high as 46%\u201390% among HCWs during doffing.3,4 Even when HCWs presume that they are trained enough, several factors may contribute to self-contamination during doffing\u2014difficulty differentiating between dirty (outside) and clean (inside) surfaces, poorly fitting PPEs, forceful movements, incorrect doffing sequence, and inconsistent PPE training.5",
