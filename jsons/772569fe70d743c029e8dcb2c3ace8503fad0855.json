The number of submissions has increased significantly, and the journal now publishes six issues each year. More importantly, the quality and diversity of the publications also improved progressively. While Respirology remains firmly the regional respiratory journal for Asian and Pacific countries, the last 12 months have seen publication of articles from many countries beyond this region. The published papers not only covered issues of local interest, but also addressed worldwide respiratory problems through large clinical trials, authoritative reviews, as well as small pilot studies establishing proof of principles of exciting novel concepts.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cancer cause of death. Based on 2002 estimates, over one million people died of lung cancer worldwide. Although most cases are related to tobacco smoking, increasing concerns have been raised on development of adenocarcinoma in Asian women, many of whom never smoked. 1 Of interest to the clinicians in Asia-Pacific countries is the finding of high incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung cancers in Asian countries (e.g. Hong Kong and Japan). Many of these patients have no or modest smoking history. 1 Ho et al. also highlighted the importance of identifying lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung-an uncommon but distinct form of non-small cell lung carcinoma that affects predominantly Asians. 2 Increasing evidence suggests that Asian patients with lung adenocarcinomas show a higher response rate to gefitinib, a small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Respirology provided a series of state-of-the-art reviews as well as original articles on the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer. Ahmed and Salgia reviewed recent research efforts to identify genomic determinants of drug susceptibility to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 revealing various EGFR kinase domain mutations that may influence response to drug treatment or differential susceptibility to various EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 3 Kato and Nishio presented a detailed review on the benefits as well as risks of these inhibitors in clinical practice. 4 A retrospective analyses of 23 Singaporean patients provided supportive data that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have anti-tumour activities. 5 Gefitinib can induce acute lung injury or interstitial pneumonitis as shown in two separate case reports published in Respirology. Both cases were successfully treated with cessation of the drug, with or without additional high-dose methylprednisolone treatment. 6, 7 Small cell lung cancer accounts for up to 25% of primary lung cancers. Cooper and Spiro reviewed the literature and emphasized that elderly patients with small cell lung cancer should not be discriminated for their age, as their response to chemotherapy is generally comparable to that of younger patients. 8 Researchers are actively searching for a sensitive and specific method for early detection of lung cancer: CT screening, autofluorescence bronchoscopy, etc. are under study. A study of 137 patients with lung cancer showed that those (n = 19) with early disease detected only on CT, but not on CXR, had significantly better prognosis (5-year survival 80% vs. 39%, respectively) than those with lung cancer visible on both CT and chest radiographs. 9 However, Shaipanich et al. believed that no single modality will achieve sufficient accuracy as a sole screening tool, and combination with additional biomarkers may be more likely to succeed. 10 PET-CT is increasingly employed in the work-up of patients with lung cancer. Low et al. reviewed their experience of 54 patients who underwent PET-CT and reminded readers that false positives do occur, including in patients with tuberculosis lymphadenitis. 11 This is especially important for clinicians practising in regions where tuberculosis is endemic.",

In 35 resected surgical specimens, Unver et al. showed that the diagnostic sensitivity of needle aspiration was similar using 18-, 22-and 25-gauge needles. 14 Readers are reminded that not all pulmonary nodules turned out to be malignant. Various case reports published in Respirology attested to the variety of other pathologies that may mimic lung cancers, including endobronchial mucosal lesions from Churg-Strauss syndrome, 15 atypical mycobacterium infection, 16 dirofilariasis (infection of the dog heartworm) and chest wall involvement from multifocal mesenchymal hamartoma. 17 Coexistence of blastoma within bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma was also reported. 18 Readers were also reminded of rare neoplasms, such as pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma 19 and pulmonary sarcoma, 20 emphasizing the need of histological confirmation of the lesions.",

            "text": "Diffuse interstitial lung diseases encompass a wide range of heterogeneous conditions with varying prognosis. Within the Asia-Pacific region, the incidences of different interstitial lung diseases vary. For example, a retrospective series suggested that the incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be lower in Maori and Pacific Islanders than the Caucasians in New Zealand. 23 In northern Israel, the incidence of sarcoidosis was found to be similar between Arabic and Jewish subjects, though the former presented usually with earlier-stage disease. 24 This year, Respirology has published overviews on extrinsic allergic alveolitis (a topic seldom reviewed) 25 and also on diffuse panbronchiolitis, a condition most common in East Asia. 26 The exact aetiological mechanisms remain unclear for both diseases. Steroid is useful in some cases of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. 25 On the other hand, macrolides remain the choice of treatment for diffuse panbronchiolitis. 26 Diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases is now largely dependent on CT scanning, but gravitydependent changes are known to occur with supine scanning, and may be mistaken as early interstitial changes. A multivariate analysis of 1098 patients suggested that subjects who were over 70 years of age, obese (BMI >25) and current smokers (>20 pack year) were more likely to have dependent changes on helical CT screening, mimicking interstitial lung diseases. 27 The spectrum of drugs and environmental agents that can induce interstitial lung diseases continue to expand. Respirology included several case reports on acute lung injury from new cancer drugs, such as transtuzumab (herceptin) 28 and gefitinib. Early recognition of this complication and withdrawal of medication result in good outcome. An interesting case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with initiation of leflunomide was described and was successfully treated with drug withdrawal and whole lung lavage. 29 Acute interstitial pneumonia from inhalation of fumes of nickel and chrome, successfully treated with corticosteroids, was also reported. 30 Demirkok et al. observed that Lofgren's syndrome was more common in May and least so in January in 87 Turkish patients, suggesting a possible environmental aetiology. 31 Two reports in Respirology this year reminded us the potential connection between autoimmunity and seemingly unrelated pulmonary diseases. Kudou et al. reported that rheumatoid factor correlated well with eosinophil counts in a patient with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. In particular, the titre of rheumatoid factor may even rise prior to clinical exacerbation-an observation that may deserve verification in larger series. 32 Coexistence of antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis was also discussed. 33",

In a large series of 118 patients with significant haemoptysis (96% had >100 mL/day) from tuberculosis or lung cancer, no significant re-bleeding was found in 73% of cases after bronchial artery embolization. 44 Repeat embolization controlled the bleeding in 12 of 32 patients who failed the first procedure.

            "text": "One of the initiatives in COPD has been the objective measurement of airflow obstruction through the implementation of spirometry in general practice and Australia has led the way in this regard. However, the study of Johns et al. showed that it is inadequate to simply introduce spirometers into general practice and that an implementation and training programme is required to ensure benefits are obtained. 57 In terms of types of spirometers, Walters et al. have confirmed that the EasyOne spirometer maintains its calibration during routine clinical use in general practice and thus passes the required quality-control tests. 58 One of the challenges in pulmonary rehabilitation is to determine the components of the programme that lead to benefit and how the programme can be practically implemented within a community. The study by Cockram et al. provides a simple prototype pulmonary rehabilitation programme, supervised by a physiotherapist but combined with a home exercise programme and shown that it is an effective intervention for achieving and maintaining improvements in function. 59 Eastwood et al. reported that a high-intensity inspiratory muscle training programme combined with general whole body exercise training was capable of improving respiratory muscle function to a point where these muscles that were unable to work anaerobically before training, were subsequently able to do so. 60 This study is the first to have shown that COPD patients can increase inspiratory muscle work rate to a level requiring a major energy contribution from anaerobic glycolytic metabolism. Previously this function had only been shown in healthy individuals. Consistent with these observations, Vella et al. provided evidence that the oxygen cost of ventilation may be a limiting factor in exercise capacity, a finding that has clinical significance to respiratory disorders. 61 There is increasing interest in the use of CT scanning in the characterization of subjects with COPD. Ohara and colleagues provide further evidence that measurement of airway dimensions and lung attenuation still does not yet have an established role in the clinical investigation of patients with COPD. 62 Omori et al. report that a considerable percentage of subjects with emphysema detected by CT screening have mild COPD, with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage 0. A better understanding of the progression of emphysema in these subjects will be required before CT screening can be recommended to detect early-stage emphysema. 63",

In support of this recommendation, Poh et al. reported that published equations derived from Caucasian subjects overestimate 6-min walk distance in Singaporean Chinese and provided relevant predicted values. 65 Likewise, Amra et al. provided normative reference values for lung transfer factor in Iran. 66 Williams et al. provide preliminary data of the ability of the 15-count breathlessness score to quantify breathlessness and recommended further research in this field. 67 Similar to the situation with lung function testing, Aggarwal et al. reported that standard severity scoring systems developed in western countries are poor at predicting patient outcome in critically ill patients admitted to respiratory intensive care units in Northern India. 68",

Simpson et al. have demonstrated that assessment of inflammatory cellular subtypes obtained from induced sputum can identify distinct phenotypic groups and proposed that this method may be important in clinical studies of asthma. 70 With the increasing recognition of a pathogenic role of the intracellular bacteria including Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species, there has been interest in the potential role of other intracellular bacteria such as Simkania negevensis. Reassuringly, Korppi et al. report that although S. negevensis appears to cause respiratory infections in Finnish infants, there is no apparent association with asthma. 71 Among the diseases that may mimic asthma and COPD are tracheobronchomalacia and excessive dynamic airway collapse, two forms of dynamic central airway obstruction that may coexist. Murgu and Colt review these entities and make recommendations regarding their diagnosis and treatment in their comprehensive review. 40 George and colleagues illustrated the utility of virtual bronchoscopy by 3D reconstruction of the tracheobronchial tree from thin-slice CT scanning in the diagnosis of Williams-Campbell syndrome, which can give rise to expiratory collapse of bronchi. 72 Hassan et al. reported that significant bronchospasm occurs in a sizeable proportion of patients presenting with painful sickle cell crises. 73 Importantly they provide evidence to suggest a pathogenic role for the pulmonary sequestration of eosinophils in the bronchoconstriction, which occurs in sickle cell disease. Their findings support the recommendation that bronchodilator therapy should represent part of the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease who have respiratory symptoms.",

The study by Al Mutair et al. investigated the effects of hubble-bubble (Sheesha or Hookah) smoking, a traditional method of smoking tobacco leaves in the Middle East and Indian Subcontinent. 84 They provide evidence that this alternative method does not limit the risk of adverse health effects of tobacco smoking. Similar research into the risks of other forms of tobacco and marijuana smoking is urgently required in view of the increasing rates of smoking worldwide.",

It is suggested that no contingency plan could cater for such health-care requirements and prioritization would be needed to preserve key personnel for the aftermath. Another scenario proposed is an outbreak similar to SARS, a situation in which close contacts and health-care workers would be cross-infected. The health-care and public health measures similar to those adopted for SARS should be effective and a pandemic potentially preventable. The editorial provides clear guidelines for the systems that need to be established for diagnosis, management, prioritization according to risk, as well as the clinical research studies that should be pre-established for rapid deployment in the event of an outbreak. The guidelines presented form a good basis for public health strategies that can be adopted in different countries within the Asia-Pacific region.",

It is known that the rapidly progressive atypical pneumonia that characterizes SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, against which almost all patients with SARS mount an antibody response. The Guangzhou group has now shown that the antibody response may persist for up to 2 years, suggesting that SARS patients may be protected from a recurrent SARS coronavirus infection during this period. 86 Varicella pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and the role of high-dose steroids has been uncertain. Adhami et al. report a case series providing evidence that corticosteroids accelerate the physiological recovery and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. 87 While this was not a randomized controlled trial, the greater severity of the patients receiving corticosteroids on admission would support the efficacy of high-dose steroids in this situation.",

Yew and Leung reviewed the risk factors and management for drug-induced liver disease from common antituberculous drugs. 93 An economic study suggested that treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cost 7-22 times more than drug-sensitive tuberculosis in Korea. 94 Continuing the great tradition of tuberculosis research in Hong Kong, Chan-Yeung et al. report that between one-fifth and one quarter of new cases of active tuberculosis in Hong Kong are due to recent transmission. 95 The authors propose that in addition to the early diagnosis and successful treatment of all active disease, treatment of latent disease should receive more attention in the control of tuberculosis in Hong Kong.",
