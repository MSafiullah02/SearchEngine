Disability and mortality after an intensive care unit (ICU) discharge remain high. Moitra et al. recently reported a 1-year mortality of 26.6% in an elderly (> 65 years old) cohort of 34,696 patients, ranging from 19.4% to 57.8%, which was dependent on the ICU length of stay [3]. Only after a period of months to several years does the risk of death in this population return to the level of the general population [4]. Patients who are admitted because of trauma and cardiovascular diseases seem to readjust at the fastest rate, with normal population survival rates being observed immediately after ICU discharge [5].",

The assessment of the health-related quality of life of patients\u2019 has become more focused in recent decades. For example, a systematic review published in 2005 identified 21 studies that evaluated the quality of life in intensive care survivors [7]. In almost all European countries, groups of lower socioeconomic status and/or educational status experienced substantially higher mortality rates accompanied by lower scores in self-reported health-assessments (e.g., the patients with a higher socioeconomic status showed a greater functional recovery after a myocardial infarction) [8]. In a recently published letter, no association between socioeconomic status and ICU mortality was found in one ICU from a high poverty rate territory [9]. Hence, the role of the socioeconomic burden on mortality and convalescence after a critical illness remains poorly understood. The effects of all levels of socioeconomic status on the health and recovery of individuals need to be further investigated to allow target interventions for both ICU and post-ICU care [10].",

Overall, this finding could be considered a sign of quality of the French ICU standard operating procedures. However, whether the FDep can determine true differences in socioeconomic status has to be questioned. When the financial domain (\u201cannual income\u201d) of the subgroup of patients who answered the social questionnaire was examined, and when they were classified as previously described, a significant difference between economic status and the outcome parameters was revealed. The mental component scale, the physical component scale, and the ICU and hospital lengths of stay vary considerably within the different income groups, and, to some extent, this effect applies to educational levels as well. When the FDep was applied to the previously classified income groups, as mentioned above, a possible contradictory classification may result (e.g., n = 63 individuals considered to be \u201cnondeprived\u201d, although they reported an income of < 8000\u201312,000 \u20ac per year). To truly define the impact of socioeconomic status on the health-related quality of life and mortality, without applying an easily accessible index, such as the FDep, a validation in a larger cohort, with a more specific investigation than the social questionnaire that we used, would be needed. It must also be remembered that income and educational level are correlated.",

In Europe, for instance, a German study, based on insurance data from 1987 to 1995 and including 416,000 patients, was able to show differences in mortality, depending on the professional status of the individuals. The study reported a four- to fivefold higher risk of long-term mortality for unskilled insured workers, compared to high-level executives [20]. When considering medical conditions, a social gradient in female breast cancer patients could be shown in a Geneva-based study, regarding mortality and socioeconomic status with respect to occupation [21]. The associations of the risks of ICU admission with sepsis and socioeconomic status in critically ill patients were recently reported in a Danish study [22]. Furthermore, a very recent German study, focusing on surgical intensive care patients, described a longer duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with unfavorable socioeconomic characteristics, such as a high number of people per household [23]. In the USA, when solely analyzing a geographically limited area, namely, Baltimore, and when dichotomizing the neighborhoods by median income level, the authors showed an association between lower household income communities and higher rates of death from sepsis [24]. Likewise, a nationwide cohort analysis study demonstrated that patients with sepsis who lived in the lowest median income quartile had a higher risk of mortality compared to residents of the highest income quartile after adjustment for the severity of illness [25]. This finding could be due to a late stage diagnosis in minority and low income groups, as was also reported in cancer patients in the USA [26]. Globally, when analyzing a large multinational study that covered 50 different countries, the authors found a high national income per capita in intensive care patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with this high national income per capita also being associated with an increased survival [27]. As a result of our study design, the patients without insurance were excluded, and no further investigations regarding insurance status were made. However, excluding patients without health insurance might have created a selection bias and could also be one reason why no differences were found. Indeed, an Australian study found a reduced in-hospital mortality for ICU patients with a compensable status of insurance, although postdischarge ICU patients were not studied [28]. According to those studies, socioeconomic status influences outcomes in the critically ill, which is consistent with our results based on the social questionnaire. Hence, the deprivation index likely only focuses on a relevant portion of socioeconomic status.",

Likewise, with regard to financial resources, the low annual income group had significantly lower scores for the physical component scale and the mental component scale, with gradual increases observed with greater earnings. It remains unclear whether this difference was due to a lack of physical activity, a lack of support from cohabiting partners and family or limited access, or a lack of compliance, when it concerned follow-up consultations with the family doctor, or whether it is connected to the lower self-reported baseline quality of life in the socially deprived individuals. The 2017 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Health at a Glance [29] statistics emphasized the differences in health perception based on income, with 80% of \u201cgood\u201d self-reported health being present in the fifth quintile (the highest income group) and less than 60% being present in the lowest income group. Additionally, in all OECD countries (including France), except for New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, men were more likely to report being in good health [29]. Therefore, as a result of those variations, the overall perceived health status and self-reported SF-36 scores might differ to a certain extent.",

            "text": "We acknowledge that this study has several limitations. First, the observational nature of the data and the lack of a control group hindered confirmation of causality and specific interactions of socioeconomic status on the outcomes. Second, we had no data on several variables that have a major impact on the reported results (i.e., patient compliance and overall behavior [e.g., a readiness to assume risk] and socioeconomic status after hospital discharge), some of which could be compared to the status prior to ICU admission. Additionally, the causes of death after ICU discharge are not known in the FROG-ICU cohort. Third, for all of the presented scores, a baseline status would provide further valuable information for the interpretation of our results. Fourth, instead of comparing our results with the normal French population, it would be interesting to compare the baseline status of hospitalized patients in general and of intensive care patients in particular. Fifth, the unverified answers to the social questionnaire and the rather low percentage of completed overall questionnaires could have biased the results. Sixth, the FDep has not been validated in critical care settings to date. Seventh, our study mostly included hospitals from urban areas and not from \u201crural\u201d or \u201cquasi-rural\u201d areas (fewer than 10,000 inhabitants); therefore, an aggregation bias could be assumed. As previously described by other authors, it is not fully clear if the gradient described by the FDep truly represents the differences between rural and urban areas. For example, when the FEDI or the Townsend index was used, opposite gradients were observed with deprivation when related to the degree of urbanicity [17]. Therefore, our study did not have a primary focus on explaining the gradient between the urban and rural areas; rather, this study assessed the association between socioeconomic status (using FDep) and outcomes. However, being aware of the aggregational bias and possible gradient between the rural and urbanized geographical regions, we excluded the Paris cohort, as described for the cross-checking analysis. Eighth, the entire study population belonged to the same country, which makes it difficult to extrapolate the results to ICUs in other countries and with other ethnicities. However, the findings of this \u201creal-world\u201d European registry are easier to translate to the general ICU population. Additionally, not all of these limitations are major issues, and the results of our study are unexpected and warrant further exploration in clinical research settings.",

Hence, interventions that occur after ICU discharge should target physical function.
