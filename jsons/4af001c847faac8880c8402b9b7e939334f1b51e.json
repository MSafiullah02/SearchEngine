(COVID- 19) pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems and clinicians around the globe. As the virus spread out of Asia, across Europe and into the United States affecting over a million patients worldwide, 1 critical questions arose about how to best deliver health care in emergency situations where material and personnel resources become scarce. [2] [3] [4] Clinicians who excel at caring for the individual patient at the bedside are now being reoriented into a system where they are being asked to see the collective public as their responsibility. As such, the clinical ethics clinicians are used to practicing is being modified by a framework of public health ethics defined by the presence of a global pandemic.

These rules have a different focus than our daily clinical ethics, which tends to focus on what each clinician is called to do for each patient, prioritizing nonmaleficence, autonomy of both patient and clinician and prominently features shared decision-making. 7 Public health ethics asks what we as a system, institution, or hospital are called to do to serve the needs of the many. The goal of public health ethics is to serve many rather than the individual patient in front of you, and stewardship of resources is key. Yet, there is also a tension in public health ethics: if we only focus on saving as many lives as possible (eg, rationing care based on comorbidities), we will perpetuate disparities because good health is not equally distributed throughout society. For example, increasingly poor health is associated with poverty, lack of education, and racial minority status. 8, 9 Thus, efficiency of resource use must be balanced by considerations of justice-that is, of fair and equitable resource use.",

            "text": "Collective ethics work best within a consensus framework, where governments and hospitals create sound advice on how to allocate resources. If clinicians are forced to allocate resources at the bedside, they betray the values that have dominated their clinical practice. The individual patient-physician relationship is the foundation for bedside clinical ethics. 7 Clinicians serve as advocates for their individual patient, providing them with the resources needed for that specific patient's care, rather than considering the greater cohort's demands. As patients, we want our physicians to advocate for our best interests, and the patient-physician relationship requires that we think our caregivers will do so. If we are critically anemic, we do not want the physician at the bedside considering whether to transfuse us or another patient at another hospital. The shifted priorities in collective ethics require a level of impartiality and consensus. For this reason, the dilemmas that demand a perspective of collective ethics should be brought to a separate, impartial triaging committee that makes consistently just and equitable decisions based on the consensus values. 19, 20 Current generalized guidelines work to provide a framework for such decision-making. However, the vague nature of these guidelines has caused confusion and permitted significant variability in interpretation. For example, there are diagnoses and conditions that are generally agreed to be emergencies that require urgent, if not emergent, surgical care-compartment syndrome, knee dislocation with vascular injury, open injuries, cauda equina syndrome, and some acute fractures just to name a few. In the case of hip fractures, studies have consistently shown reduced mortality and morbidity when surgery is performed within 24 hours. 21, 22 However, all acute injuries do not need to be surgically addressed with the same urgency, if at all. What about the acute clavicle fracture? The acute ligamentous elbow injury?",

This is clearly different from usual times, where shared decisionmaking would instead be pursued to answer the question as to what we ought to do. 23 In the context of a pandemic, surgeons are most knowledgeable about what injuries are equally amenable to nonoperative management. For example, according to American College of Surgeons' guidelines, acute Achilles tendon rup-tures fall under a recommendation to \"schedule\" even under Phase 3 conditions where the recommendation is to also \"eliminate elective practice.\" 24 Studies have shown equivalent plantar flexion strength and insignificant differences in re-rupture rate with treatment of function rehabilitation compared with operative management. 25 In this situation of clinical equipoise where nonsurgical and operative treatment approach similar outcomes, the principles of stewardship and maximizing benefit for the collective public suggest that an initial treatment of nonoperative management is the most prudent course, given the scarcity of PPE, sedation medications, and personnel. As the crisis wanes, the ethical landscape will shift again. As times return to a new normal, we will again pursue shared decision-making in situations of clinical equipoise, in contrast to the current model where physicians are determining surgical need.",

In situations where direct comparisons are unfair and the metrics for measuring the value of an intervention are relative, an independent surgical review committee should make triaging decisions. 19, 20 This removes decisionmaking from individual physicians who will rightly be advocating for their own patient's best interests. Following recommendations from the American College of Surgeons, an interdisciplinary team with representatives from surgery, anesthesia, and nursing can provide transparent, equitable oversight and act as steward in the best interest of the patient cohort. 19, 20 We would recommend that bioethicists also be considered a valuable addition to the committee.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addresses the question of COVID-19 patient care for pregnant healthcare workers by placing the burden on facilities \"to consider limiting exposure\" to \"confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures\" but acknowledges challenges of \"staffing availability.\" 29 The limited staffing ability of many health systemsbecause of long-standing understaffing or clinician illness-is going to require the use of redeployment strategies. Clinicians will be practicing in the areas outside their usual practice 13 -anesthesia clinicians who have primarily worked in the operating room will be tasked with managing intensive care units, orthopaedic surgeons will be tasked with functioning as floor medical clinicians, and psychiatrists will be tasked with screening patients in the emergency department. Practicing at the edge of one's competency-or beyond it-will be uncomfortable for clinicians. Does this discomfort represent bad ethics? How can we step up to the challenge to serve during the pandemic but also maintain one of our main ethos of nonmaleficence, \"do no harm\" and give patients the good care that they deserve and trust us to deliver?",

To minimize or eliminate clinicians feeling that they are violating their moral beliefs, wherever possible the health system should create protocols and guidelines to direct the allocation of scarce resources. This will permit physicians to advocate for their patients, avoid bedside rationing, and still be part of a system that is working toward the greater good. Furthermore, the health system and government must be transparent with clinicians about the available resources so that the crisis is appropriately framed according to triage principles clinicians are taught during training, rather than a disorderly, ad hoc approach, ensuring that clinicians do not feel that they are part of acts that transgress their \"deeply held moral beliefs and expectations.\" 33",

Pandemic environments, however, bring challenges that can only be addressed by moving to a public health ethics frame. The standard question of what I ought to do is modified to what we, as a cohort, ought to do. Hospitals, healthcare systems, and governments must make decisions about how resources are allocated. This incorporation of collective obligations does not, however, eliminate individual clinical responsibility but rather has the capacity to change it: the hospital needs more floor medical clinicians, so clinicians inherit a responsibility to step into that role or a fracture that might nor-mally be treated with surgery is not deemed urgent enough to spend surgical resources on, so surgeons inherit a duty to nonoperatively manage injuries. In all such cases, there is a disconnect between one's pre-COVID-19 sense of responsibility and the one that is developing now and that disconnect is ripe for moral distress, residue, and injury. Our hope is that by identifying that likelihood and the way in which it is a function of changing moral frameworks, we can put ourselves in a better position to mitigate it.",
