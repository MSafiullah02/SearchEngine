In humans the importance has recently increased considerably with the emergence of new human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003), HKU1 and NL63 (Pyrc et al., in press). The outbreak of the coronavirus infection which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has proven that an infection with a member of the order of the Nidovirales can have serious health consequences (De Clercq, 2004). Nidovirales consist of a broad group of viruses with glycosylated envelopes containing linear, single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity. Coronaviruses belong to this order together with toroviruses, arteriviruses, and roniviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006).",

Reliance on vaccines for protection is possible for only a few of these nidoviruses and when available safety and efficacy are under debate. Therefore, it seems advisable to develop anti-nidoviral strategies that are save and effective. New anti-SARS coronavirus strategies were swiftly explored (De Clercq, 2004, De Clercq, 2006) and it became clear that the application of carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) directed against the glycosylated envelope of these viruses may show promising antiviral activity (Balzarini, 2005).",

Importantly, the ability of lectins to bind pathogens has been explored in vivo as plant and cyanobacterium-derived lectins were recently studied as microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV (Balzarini et al., 2004a, Tsai et al., 2004). Moreover, systemic application of these compounds in animals did not result in acute toxic effects (Balzarini et al., 2004a, Balzarini et al., 2005a, Balzarini et al., 2007, 2003) which justifies further exploration of this class of antivirals.",

CA (Cymbidium sp. agglutinin) is a 25 kDa dimer with specificity for mannose sugars of which the preferred conformation is not known. UDA (Urtica dioica agglutinin) is among the smallest plant monomeric lectins, 8.7 kDa in size, with a N-acetylglucosamine specificity (Van Damme et al., 1998). Interestingly, promising non-plant derived glycan-targeting compounds such as the mannose-specific pradimicin-A (PRM-A) extracted from the actinomycete strain Actinomadura hibisca, showed fungi (Oki et al., 1988) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binding capacities (Tanabe-Tochikura et al., 1990). Also cyanovirin-N (CV-N), a lectin derived from the procaryotic cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum is specific for \u03b1(1,2) mannose oligomers and shows a remarkable anti-HIV activity (Boyd et al., 1997, Dey et al., 2000).",

Inhibition of virus production or cytopathogenicity can be assessed (Bedard et al., 1999, Pauwels et al., 1988). Alternatively reporter genes can be used to monitor the amount of infected cells and virus replication. (Olivo, 1996, Westby et al., 2005). In this study the antiviral activity of plant lectins, the non-peptidic antibiotic PRM-A and the procaryotic CV-N was determined against members of the order Nidovirales. Immunocytochemistry, reporter gene expression and colorimetric (MTT) assays, which measure the number of infected cells, virus replication and cell viability, respectively, were compared as screening methods for antiviral activity of lectins. Using these assays we were able to show that most of the investigated nidoviruses were sensitive to carbohydrate-binding agents.",

When FIPV Black TN406HP was assessed, the cells were fixed at 16 h post-infection, because serotype I coronavirus antigen expression in FCWF cells appeared at a later moment compared to serotype II FCoV strains. Immunoperoxidase (IPOX) detection of MHV-positive cells was carried out by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MHV (K135) (Rottier et al., 1981) in combination with a HRP swine\u2013anti-rabbit antibody (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). An ascitic fluid sample (A40) from a cat that had succumbed to feline infectious peritonitis was used for the immunodetection of FCoV 79-1683, FIPV Black TN406HP and FIPV 79-1146 combined with a HRP goat\u2013anti-cat (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH, USA).

In all cases the mannose-specific lectins GNA, HHA and CA showed antiviral activity against all Nidovirales evaluated. The plant lectins GNA and HHA showed EC50 values in the higher picomolar or lower nanomolar concentration range for IBV, FIPV Black TN406HP and TGEV (Table 1). Replication of serotype II FCoV strains, Berne virus and equine arteritis virus was inhibited by the mannose-specific plant lectins at concentrations that rank in the higher nanomolar concentration range (Table 1). Also, the GlcNAc-specific UDA showed pronounced antiviral activity. Although it was 10\u201320-fold less effective against FIPV Black TN406HP, IBV and TGEV than the mannose-specific lectins, it proved virtually equally active against the other viruses (Table 1).",

Therefore, we investigated the antiviral activity of glycan-targeting compounds, including mannose and GlcNAc-binding plant lectins, pradimicin-A (PRM-A), that is a mannose-binding non-peptidic antibiotic formerly evaluated for antifungal activity and cyanovirin-N (CV-N), an \u03b1(1,2) mannose-specific procaryotic lectin. Glycosylation of proteins is not unique for viruses and glycans are also present on vertebrate host cell glycoproteins. The sugar content of the viral envelope fully depends on the host cell glycosylation machinery. Although, the characteristics of N-glycosylation of host cell and virus glycoproteins are in principle similar, it should be kept in mind that still striking differences in the nature of the glycans can be found between viral (i.e. HIV, HCV) envelope glycoproteins and host cellular glycoproteins. Both HIV and HCV glycoproteins contain a high amount of high-mannose type glycans. Such glycan types are much less abundantly present, or even absent, in many mammalian glycoproteins. Still, antiviral agents specifically targeting glycosylated proteins can have side effects when administered systemically. This potential problem was, however, not observed in vivo for a number of carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) (Balzarini et al., 2004a, Balzarini et al., 2005a, Balzarini et al., 2007, 2003).

Cell viability after virus infection as indicated by color formation in an MTT-based assay is classically used to evaluate the inhibition of viral infection by antivirals. In this assay multiple replication steps will occur as the infection process is initiated at a low multiplicity of infection. To establish a faster and more accurate method for antiviral examination against coronaviruses, two alternative methods were explored. Both IPOX and luciferase-based assays represent the evaluation of the initial infection processes: attachment and entry followed by protein production. The tests are terminated before virus release from infected cells. Therefore, in contrast to the MTT assay, no multiple replication cycles occur. This might explain the differences in EC50 values obtained using IPOX and luciferase-based assays compared to the MTT assay. Nevertheless, all assays were indicative for rather similar antiviral activity of CBA towards nidoviruses. In that respect the assays were interchangeable. Therefore, the possibility to use the luciferase-based evaluation method for high throughput screening may facilitate the research of antivirals directed against coronaviruses. Both IPOX and luciferase assays were used as an alternative to screen the ability of CBA to inhibit MHV A59. Since the MTT assay could not be used due to the syncytium formation following infection. Mitochondria in giant cells reduced MTT to a similar level as non-infected control cells.",

These results are in the same ranges as found for GNA and HHA in their efficacy against HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (Balzarini et al., 2004a) and the SARS coronavirus (Balzarini et al., 2004c). For all viruses evaluated the host cells in the antiviral assays were derived from the target species of the virus. However, we used a simian Vero cell adapted virus strain for evaluation of IBV, as a chicken-based cell system was not available. This non-natural host will generate a simian-like glycosylation pattern on the IBV envelope proteins. This might explain the very low EC50 found for the plant lectins GNA and HHA. We showed also inhibitory effects for CA towards FIPV and MHV. In earlier studies this compound formerly demonstrated a high antiviral activity against retroviruses (EC50: 0.003 \u03bcM) but less towards cytomegalovirus infections (EC50: 0.35 \u03bcM) (Balzarini et al., 1992). Cytomegalovirus, SIV and HIV-1 infections could all be very efficiently inhibited by UDA (Balzarini et al., 1992). We were able to show for UDA also a high antiviral efficacy against all evaluated Nidovirales except PRRSV. The low antiviral effect of CBA towards PRRSV might be explained by the fact that sialic acids structures are mainly involved in the attachment of PRRSV to PAMs whereas high-mannose glycans are reported to be less important (Delputte and Nauwynck, 2004).",

            "text": "Pradimicin-A, a mannose-binding non-peptidic antibiotic showed antiviral activity against MHV, FIPV serotype I, TGEV and IBV. The efficacy against Bernevirus infections was low. The EC50 values were in line with the anti-HIV-1 EC50 of PRM-A ranges found earlier: \u22654.2 \u03bcM in HIV-infected MT-4 and CEM cytopathogenicity systems and \u226515 \u03bcM in a giant cell formation assay (Balzarini et al., 2007, Tanabe et al., 1988). Despite the fact that PRM-A has a specificity for d-mannose structures (Fujikawa et al., 1998), it was not able to inhibit the FCoV serotype II strains FIPV 79-1146 and FCoV 79-1683 or the arteriviruses PRRSV and EAV, even at the highest concentrations evaluated. It is somewhat puzzling that PRM-A is inactive against FCoV serotype II strains and arteriviruses, since it is suggested to have an \u03b1(1,2)-mannose configuration tropism (Iagrashi and Oki, 2004) similar to CV-N. Additionally, we included CV-N in our studies for comparative reasons. Cyanovirin-N was shown to have an inhibitory effect towards HIV-1 and SIV (Balzarini et al., 2006, Boyd et al., 1997) and was highly active against both MHV and FIPV serotype II infections as determined by the luciferase-based assay (lower nanomolar range). Therefore, we conclude that glycans containing these structures are present on the FIPV serotype II and MHV viruses propagated in our culturing systems. The discrepancy in PRM-A antiviral activity towards FCoV serotypes I and II might be due to the different receptor usage influencing the entire infection process (Smith and Helenius, 2004). Serotype II FCoV utilize fAPN (Tresnan et al., 1996) as primary receptor whereas for serotype I coronaviruses the attachment to the host cell is relying on a different molecule, currently unknown (Hohdatsu et al., 1998). Alternatively, since serotype I coronaviruses are also less sensitive to HHA and GNA, PRM-A may be active against these viruses as well, but those drug active concentrations cannot be reached due to insolubility of the compound.",

In the natural situation they may also play an important role in the defense mechanism of the plant (Vierheilig et al., 1996). Similar molecules are participating in the innate immune system of vertebrates, a specifically binding the glycosylated proteins of pathogens (Hart et al., 2002). CBA binding mannose (GNA, HHA, CA, CV-N or PRM-A) or GlcNAc (UDA) are not expected to bind to selected glycosylated sites in a specific manner. As mannose and GlcNAc molecules are present throughout the glycosylated proteins CBA may concomitantly bind at several glycans on the virus envelope. However, it should be mentioned that CBA usually show poor recognition of monosaccharides but their affinity and selectivity is much higher for specific carbohydrate oligomer configurations. These properties may also explain the different potencies of CBA against different viruses, even within the same virus family. The lectins used in our test inhibit infection but do not seem to have virucidal properties as adsorption to the host cell of the virus in the presence of the compound still lead to a productive infection upon removal of the lectin (unpublished results).",

The glycosylation on coronavirus envelope proteins is suggested to serve a similar purpose (Ansari et al., 2006, Chakraborti et al., 2005). One can speculate that by targeting this protective shield with carbohydrate-binding agents viruses are forced to generate mutants with deleted or altered glycosylation sites as already demonstrated to occur for HIV in the presence of several types of CBA (i.e. plant lectins, PRM-A, CV-N) (Balzarini et al., 2004b, Balzarini et al., 2005b, Balzarini et al., 2006, Balzarini et al., 2007). As a consequence the immunogenic epitopes will be exposed to the immune system (Balzarini, 2005) resulting in triggering of the production of neutralizing antibodies or a cellular immune response against the uncovered immunogenic epitopes. Therapy of chronic virus infections can benefit from this strategy. Whether this also applies to nidoviral infections is uncertain, although some of these viruses remain in the animal body for a prolonged time period (Glaser et al., 1997, Herrewegh et al., 1997, Naqi et al., 2003).",
