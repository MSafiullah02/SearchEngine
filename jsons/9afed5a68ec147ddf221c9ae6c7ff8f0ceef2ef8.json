            "text": "Motivation: Drugs and diseases play a central role in many areas of biomedical research and healthcare. Aggregating knowledge about these entities across a broader range of domains and languages is critical for information extraction (IE) applications. In order to facilitate text mining methods for analysis and comparison of patient's health conditions and adverse drug reactions reported on the Internet with traditional sources such as drug labels, we present a new corpus of Russian language health reviews. Results: The Russian Drug Reaction Corpus (RUDREC) is a new partially annotated corpus of consumer reviews in Russian about pharmaceutical products for the detection of health-related named entities and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. The corpus itself consists of two parts, the raw one and the labelled one. The raw part includes 1.4 million health-related user-generated texts collected from various Internet sources, including social media. The labelled part contains 500 consumer reviews about drug therapy with drug-and disease-related information. Labels for sentences include health-related issues or their absence. The sentences with one are additionally labelled at the expression level for identification of fine-grained subtypes such as drug classes and drug forms, drug indications, and drug reactions. Further, we present a baseline model for named entity recognition (NER) and multi-label sentence classification tasks on this corpus. The macro F1 score of 74.85% in the NER task was achieved by our RuDR-BERT model. For the sentence classification task, our model achieves the macro F1 score of 68.82% gaining 7.47% over the score of BERT model trained on Russian data. Availability: We make the RuDReC corpus and pretrained weights of domain-specific BERT models freely available at https://github.com/cimm-kzn/RuDReC",

            "text": "In this work, we describe the design, composition, and construction of a large dataset of user-generated texts (UGTs) about pharmaceutical products in Russian. Similar to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) in Russia accumulates data provided by volunteer reports on the risks of taking various medicines in order to ensure their safe use. Since some particular medications may interact with others in a non-obvious way, creating and using such resources leads to significant difficulties. Information from online sources is considered to be a valuable source for Roszdravnadzor or pharmaceutical companies in order to correct the use of a drug when necessary. Thus, our corpus has been designed with the explicit purpose to facilitate the methods for learning complex knowledge of primary interactions between different drugs, diseases, and adverse reactions. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of our study. The corpus, which we call the Russian Drug Reaction Corpus (RUDREC), contains an aggregation of texts of the patients' feedback on the use of drugs in various therapeutic groups or their experience with the healthcare system in general; we have taken care to ensure that we have collected representative samples intended for training advanced machine learning methods. Recent advances in deep contextualized representations via language models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or domainspecific biomedical models such as BioBERT offer new opportunities to improve the models for classification and entity recognition. Our primary goal has been, therefore, to construct a large (partially) annotated corpus in order to stimulate the development of automated text mining methods for finding meaningful information in the patients' narratives in the Russian language.",

The larger part is a raw corpus of 1.4M health comments that can be used to train modern distributed semantics models whose training is based on self-supervised objectives such as the next token prediction (as in, e.g., word2vec) or predicting masked tokens (as in, e.g., BERT). The second, smaller part, contains 500 richly annotated reviews to allow the training of downstream task-specific models. The primary downstream tasks in our case are named entity recognition and multi-label classification. The labeling in the second part consists of two main components: sentence labels and entity labels. We have split the review posts into sentences and labeled them for the presence of drug indications and symptoms of a disease (DI), adverse drug reactions (ADR), drug effectiveness (DE), drug ineffectiveness (DIE). In the entity identification phase, we identified and extracted 6 entity types: drug names, drug classes, drug forms, ADR, DI, and Findings. In total, we have labeled 2202 sentences and 4566 entities.",

Starting from 2014, some studies began to utilize the powers of social media and deep learning (especially suitable for training on large available datasets that are the main advantage of using UGTs) for pharmacovigilance purposes; in particular, researchers have considered the problems of text (post) classification and extraction of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (Karimi et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2018; Alvaro et al., 2017; Zolnoori et al., 2019) . Recent studies primarily employ neural architectures; in particular, Tutubalina and Nikolenko (2017) The CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus (CADEC) dataset collected by Karimi et al. (2015) became a de facto standard for the extraction of health-related entities such as ADRs from user reviews. It contains 1253 medical forum posts taken from the AskaPatient web portal 1 about 12 drugs divided into two categories: Diclofenac and Lipitor. All posts were annotated manually by medical students and computer scientists who labeled five types of entities, including ADRs and names of medicines or drugs. Average inter-annotator agreement rates computed over a subset of 55 user posts with related span matching and tag settings showed that agreement across four annotators in a subset of Diclofenac posts was approximately 78%, while the agreement between two annotators in a subset of Lipitor posts was approximately 95%.",

Second, sentences were annotated with four types of entities: ADR, WD, DI, SSI. Two of the annotators were pharmacy students, and two annotators had a background in health sciences. The resulting pairwise agreement for a strict match was 0.86 for the entire dataset, ranging from 0.81 for the WD class to 0.91 for DI. Shelmanov et al.

The authors extended an annotation scheme from the CLEF eHealth 2014 Task 2 (Suominen et al., 2013) .

The number of entities for each category and inter-annotator agreement rates were not provided, and the annotators did not perform terminology association.

There are interesting disproportionalities in the frequencies (normalized columns) of different types of labels. The immunomodulators group has the lowest representation of adverse drug reactions, while the antidepressants (sleeping) the highest one.

All NER models were trained without an explicit selection of parameters on the RUDREC corpus. The loss function became stable (without significant decreases) after 35-40 epochs. We use Adam optimizer with polynomial decay to update the learning rate on each epoch with warm-up steps in the beginning. For sentence classification, we utilize the Tensorflow implementation of BERT with sigmoid activation over dense output layer and cross-entropy loss function. For each label, we used the sigmoid value of 0.5 as a classification threshold. We fine-tuned each model for 10 epochs with a batch size of 16.

Second, RuBERT, with a vocabulary of Russian subtokens generated on Wikipedia and news, outperforms Multi-BERT. Third, similarly to sentence classification, the performance of RuDR-BERT on FINDING is significantly lower than on ADR and DI. Finally, all models achieve much higher performance for the detection of drugs rather than diseases; it can be explained by boundary problems in multi-word expressions. The average number of tokens on drug-related entities is 1.06, while the average number of tokens on disease-related entities is 1.77. To obtain metrics for disease-related entities, we replaced ADR, DI, and Finding entity types with Disease entity type in the gold standard and predicted data. The same procedure was done for drugrelated entities except that Drugname, Drugform, and Drugclass were replaced by Drug.
