            "text": "Cutaneous drug eruptions are one of the most common types of adverse reaction to medications, with an overall incidence of 2\u20133 % in hospitalized patients [1]. In particular, drug induced exfoliative dermatitis (ED) are a group of rare and more severe drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) involving skin and mucous membranes and usually occurring from days to several weeks after drug exposure [2]. Erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the main clinical presentations of drug induced ED. Important data on ED have been obtained by RegiSCAR (European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs: www.regiscar.org), an ongoing pharmaco-epidemiologic study conducted in patients with SJS and TEN. Overall, T cells are the central player of these immune-mediated drug reactions. Immune-histopathological features allow to distinguish generalized bullous drug eruption from SJS/TEN [3\u20136]. Still, treatment indication, choice and dosage remain unclear, and efficacy yet unproven. Here we provide a systematic review of frequency, risk factors, molecular and cellular mechanisms of reactions, clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapy approaches to drug induced ED.",

Albeit the lack of epidemiologic data regarding EM, its reported prevalence is less than 1 % [7\u201310]. Several authors report the incidence of hospitalization for EM ranging from 0.4\u20136 cases per million people per year of northern Europe [11] to almost 40 cases per million people per year of United States [12]. EM usually occurs in young adults of 20\u201340 years of age [13], with women affected more frequently than men (1.5:1.0) [14]. Recurrence occurs in around one-third of cases [15] and there is a genetic predisposition for certain Asian groups [16]. Mucosal involvement could achieve almost 65 % of patients [17].

Scientific evidences suggest a role for HLAs and drug-induced SJS/TEN, although some racial differences have been found that can be due to variation of frequencies of these alleles and to the presence of other susceptibility genes [26]. These studies have confirmed an association between carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN with HLA-B*1502 allele among Han Chinese [27], carbamazepine and HLA-A*3101 and HLA-B*1511 [16], phenytoin and HLA-B*1502 [28], allopurinol and HLA-B*5801 [29]. For carbamazpine, several studies have found a common link between specific HLAs and different kinds of cutaneous adverse reactions, as for HLA-A*3101 in Japanese [30] and Europeans [31]. Because a certain degree of cross-reactivity between the various aromatic anti-epileptic drugs exists, some HLAs have been found to be related to SJS/TEN with two drugs, as the case of HLA-B*1502 with both phenytoin and oxcarbazepine [32].",

            "text": "Apoptosis-inducing factors and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity have been deeply investigated in ED. Four main pathways have been found to play important roles in the pathogenesis of keratinocyte death: (1) Fas-FasL interaction, (2) Perforin/granzyme B pathway, (3) Granulysin and (4) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [26].Fas-FasL interaction: Fas is a membrane-bound protein that after interaction with Fas-ligand (FasL) induces a programmed cell death, through the activation of intracellular caspases. T and NK lymphocytes can produce FasL that eventually binds to target cells. In ED increased levels of FasL have been detected in patients\u2019 sera [33]. The exact source of FasL production has not been yet identified as different groups have postulated that the production might be sought in keratinocytes themselves [33] or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [34]. In any case all authors concluded that the blockage of FasL prevents keratinocyte apoptosis [35]. The exact role of FasL in the pathogenesis of toxic epidermal necrolysis is still questionable especially because a correlation between serum FasL levels and disease severity has not been established and because its levels have been found to be increased also in drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and maculopapular eruption [36].Perforin/granzyme B pathway: Nassif and colleagues have proposed a role for perforin/grazyme B in keratinocyte death [37]. They found that the inhibition of these molecules could attenuate the cytotoxic effect of lymphocytes toward keratinocytes. A correlation between increased levels of perforin/granzyme B and the severity of TEN was also described [38].Granulysin: Granulysin is a pro-apoptotic protein that binds to the cell membrane by means of charge interaction without the need of a specific receptor, producing a cell membrane disruption, and leading to possible cell death. Chung and colleagues found an high expression of this molecule in TEN blister fluid [39] and confirmed both in vitro and in vivo its dose-dependent cytotoxicity [39]. Moreover, after granulysin depletion, they observed an increase in cell viability. The serum levels of granulysin were also found to be increased in the early stage of SJS/TEN, but not in other cutaneous DHR [40].Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1: TNF-\u03b1 seems also to play an important role in TEN [41]. The fluid of blisters from TEN patients was found to be rich in TNF-\u03b1, produced by monocytes/macrophages present in the epidermis [42], especially the subpopulation expressing CD16, known to produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines [43]. TNF-\u03b1 has a dual role: interacts with TNF-R1 activating Fas pathway and activates NF-\u03baB leading to cell survival. Although the final result of this dual interaction is still under investigation, it seems that the combination of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 (also present in TEN patients) and the activation of other death receptors such as TWEAK can lead to apoptosis of keratinocytes [44].",

Even though there is not a significant increase in the number of T cells infiltrating the skin of TEN patients, it was found that their role is crucial, even more than HLAs types. In fact, it was demonstrated that the specificity of the TCR is a required condition for the self-reaction to occur. In particular, a specific T cell clonotype was present in the majority of patients with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN and that this clonotype was absent in all patients tolerant to the drug who shared the same HLA with the SJS/TEN patients [45]. The enhanced activation of CD8 T cells seems also to be influenced by the impaired function of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells found in the peripheral blood of TEN patients in the acute phase [46].",

EMM is a clinically severe, potentially life-threatening, extensive sloughing of epidermis, generally involving mucosal tissue. In EMM lesions typically begin on the extremities and sometimes spread to the trunk. Infectious agents are the major cause of EM, in around 90 % of cases, especially for EM minor and in children. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 are the main triggers in young adults (>80 % of cases), followed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Mycoplasma pneumonia [55\u201358]. Among drug related cases, the main triggering factors are sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), penicillins, and anticonvulsants (Table 1) [59]. Neoplastic conditions (renal and gastric carcinoma), autoimmune disease (inflammatory bowel disease), HIV infection, radiation, and food additives/chemicals have been reported to be predisposing factor [59].",

The strength of association with the development of SJS/TEN may vary among countries and historical periods, reflecting differences in ethnicities and prescription habits among the studied populations [61\u201364]. Exposure to anticonvulsivants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine), cotrimoxazole and other sulfa drugs (sulfasalazine), allopurinol and oxicam NSAIDs [2] confers a higher risk of developing SJS/TEN. Several authors reported also an increased incidence for aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, and quinolones [61, 62]. Drugs such as paracetamol, other non-oxicam NSAIDs and furosemide, bringing a relatively low risk of SJS/TEN a priori, are also highly prevalent as putative culprit agents in large SJS/TEN registries, due to their widespread use in the general population [63, 64] (Table 1). Rarely, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, dengue virus, cytomegalovirus, and contrast media may be the causative agent of SJS and TEN [22, 65\u201367].",

EMM is characterizes by target lesions, circular lesions of 1-2 cm of diameter, that are defined as typical or atypical that tends to blister. Typical target lesions consist of three components: a dusky central area or blister, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring of edema, and an erythematous halo on the periphery. Atypical target lesions manifest as raised, edematous, palpable lesions with only two zones of color change and/or an extensive exanthema with a poorly defined border darker in the center (Fig. 1).

            "text": "As described in Table 3, major differential diagnosis of EM and SJS/TEN are (1) staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), (2) autoimmune blistering diseases and disseminated fixed bullous drug eruption, (3) others severe delayed DHR [6, 70, 82] (4) Graft versus host diseaseSSSS is characterized by periorificial face scabs, de-epithelialization of friction zones and conspicuous desquamation after initial erythroderma. Trigger is an exotoxin released by Staphylococcus aureus [83]. A useful sign for differential diagnosis is the absence of mucosal involvement, except for conjunctiva. Main discriminating factors between EMM, SJS, SJS-TEN, TEN and SSSS is summarized in Table 3 [84].Pemphigus vulgaris, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid and linear IgA dermatosis have to be considered. In order to rule out autoimmune blistering diseases, direct immune fluorescence staining should be additionally performed to exclude the presence of immunoglobulin and/or complement deposition in the epidermis and/or the epidermal-dermal zone, absent in ED. The Nikolsky\u2019s sign is not specific for SJS/TEN, in fact it is present also in auto-immune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by large, tense bullae, but may begin as an urticarial eruption. Linear IgA dermatosis most commonly presents in patients older than 30 years. The lesions consist of pruritic, annular papules, vesicles, and bullae that are found in groups, clinically it is similar to dermatitis herpetiformis, without a gluten-sensitive enteropathy [85]. Bullous dermatoses can be debilitating and possibly fatal. Pemphigus vulgaris usually starts in the oral mucosa followed by blistering of the skin, which is often painful. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is associated with neoplasms, most commonly of lymphoid tissue, but also Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, sarcomas, thymomas and Castleman\u2019s disease.Other delayed DHRAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is characterized by acute erythematous skin lesions, generally arising in the face and intertriginous areas, subsequently sterile pinhead-sized nonfollicular pustules arise and if they coalesce, may sometimes mimic a positive Nikolsky\u2019s sign and in this case the condition may be misinterpreted as TEN [86].Drug reaction with Eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can mimic SJS and TEN in the early phases, since ED can occur together with the typical maculo-papular rash. In contrast with DRESS, eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes are not described in patients with SJS or TEN. Both DRESS and SJS may have increased liver enzymes and hepatitis, but they occur in only 10 % of cases of SJS compared to 80 % of DRESS. Interstitial nephritis is common in DRESS syndrome, occurring roughly in 40 % of cases, whereas pre-renal azotemia may occur in SJS and TEN.Graft versus host disease (GVHD) Acute GVHD usually happens within the first 6 months after a transplant. Common acute symptoms include abdominal pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, jaundice, skin rash and eyes dryness and therefore could mimic the prodromal and early phase of ED. The diagnosis of GVDH requires histological confirmation [87].",

In case of an oral mucositis that impairs nutrition, it is indicated to position a nasogastric tube. Also a vesical catheter should be placed to avoid urethral synechiae and to have a precise fluid balance. In case of a respiratory failure, oxygen should be administrated and a NIMV may be required. Temporary tracheostomy may be necessary in case of extended mucosal damage. In serious cases invasive ventilation can be necessary for ARDS. It is also extremely important to obtain within the first 24 h cultural samples from skin together with blood, urine, nasal, pharyngeal and bronchus cultures. Ophthalmologic consultations must be repeated at fixed intervals to avoid the appearance of conjunctival irreversible complications such as chronic conjunctivitis with squamous metaplasia, trichiasis, symblepharon, punctate keratitis and sicca syndrome.

            "text": "Hydration and hemodynamic balance. Fluid balance is a main focus. Once established the percentage of the involved skin, lactate Ringer infusion of 1\u20132 mL/Kg/ % of involved skin must be started during the first 24 h [91]. The velocity of infusion should be regulated according to patients arterial pressure with the aim of 30 mL/h urinary output (1 mL/kg/h in case of a child). Blood gas analysis, glucose and creatinine levels together with electrolytes should be evaluated and therapy should be modified accordingly. Vasoactive amines may be necessary in case of shock. Albumin is recommended only is albumin serum level is <2.5 mg/dL. Furosemide or ethacrynic acid may be required to maintain an adequate urinary output [90].Nutritional support. An increased metabolism is typical of patients with extended disepithelizated areas. This hypermetabolic state is also furtherly increased by the inflammation present in affected areas. Early enteral nutrition has also a protective effect on the intestinal mucosa and decreases bacterial colonization. Usually the amount of calories is 1500\u20132000 kcal/day and the velocity of infusion is gradually increased based on patients tolerability [92].Gastric protection. To avoid the appearance of gastric stress ulcer it is recommended to start a therapy with intravenous proton pump inhibitors.Anticoagulation therapy. For the prevention of deep venous thrombosis; usually low molecular weight heparin at prophylactic dose are used.Antipyretic therapy. It is recommended to use 1.5 mg/kg hydrocortisone. If necessary, it can be repeated every 6\u20138 h. NSAIDs should be avoided as they can induce ED as well.Painkiller therapy. Intravenous administration is recommended. In more severe cases continuous iv therapy can be necessary. Most common used drugs are: morphine, fentanyl, propofol and midazolam.Antibiotic therapy. It is not recommended to use prophylactic antibiotic therapy. It should be used only in case of a documented positivity of cultural samples. If there is a high suspicion of infection without a documented source of infection, broad range empiric therapy should be started.Antiviral therapy. Ganciclovir and cidofovir should be used when polymerase-chain reactions (PCR) on peripheral blood or other biological sample identifies a viral reactivation (HHV6, HHV7, EBV and CMV). In more severe cases antiviral therapies should be given together with intravenous immunoglobulins [93].Growth-factors (G-CSF). It recommended to used G-CSF in patients with febrile neutropenia [94, 95].Plasmapheresis. It should be considered only once the patient is stable and if the skin damage is still ongoing and doesn\u2019t respond to other conventional therapies (corticosteroids or IVIG). Plasmapheresis may have a role in the treatment of ED because it removes Fas-L [96], other cytokines known to be implied in the pathogenesis (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1) [97, 98]. Moreover Mawson A and colleagues hypothesized that the efficacy of plasmapheresis is able to reduce serum level of vitamin A. In patients with SJS/TEN increased serum levels of retinoid acid have been found. These levels could reflect the interaction between culprit drugs and aldehyde dehydrogenase that is the enzyme which metabolizes retinoid acid. Increased level of retinoid acid could be responsible for keratinocytes apoptosis [99].Topical treatment. Patients must be cleaned in the affected areas until epithelization starts. In spared areas it is necessary to avoid skin detachment. It is also recommended to void larger vesicles with a syringe. It is important to protect the damaged skin with sterile fat dressing especially in the genital area. 5 % silver nitrate compresses have antiseptic properties. Synthetic bilaminar membranes with silver nitrate have also a role in skin repairing and avoid protein loss through the damaged skin [100, 101]. It is advised against the use of silver sulfadiazine because sulphonamide can be culprit agents. Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal umbilical cord cells seems also to be highly efficacious [102]. Accurate eye cleaning with saline solution is fundamental for the prevention of synechiae and for reducing corneal damage. In more severe cases corneal protective lens can be used. It could also be useful to use artificial tears and lubricating antiseptic gels. The applications of topical cyclosporine and autologous serum have also been showed to be useful in refractory cases [103]. Oral hygiene with antiseptic and painkiller mouthwash (chlorhexidine + lidocaine + aluminum hydroxide) together with aerosol therapy with saline and bronchodilators can reduce upper airways symptoms.",

Recently, a meta-analysis based on 6 retrospective studies evaluating the role of corticosteroids alone or together with IVIG has been published [107]. In this study, 965 patients were reviewed.

A recently published meta-analysis by Huang [110] and coworkers on IVIG in SJS/SJS-TEN/TEN reviewed 17 studies with 221 patients and compared the results obtained with high-dosage IVIG (>2 g/kg) compared to lower-dosage IVIG (<2 g/kg). 12 out of 17 studies concluded for a positive role of IVIG in ED. In the 5 studies that concluded negatively for IVIG, the dosage was below 0.4 g/kg/day and treatment was maintained for less than 5 days. Schwartz RA et al. [49] confirmed these results and even suggested that higher dosage regimen with 2.7\u20134 g/kg seem to be more effective in survival outcome. A recent review [111] on 33 pediatric cases of TEN and 6 cases of SJS/TEN overlap showed that therapy with IVIG with a dosage of 0.25\u20131.5 g/kg for 5 days resulted in 0 % mortality rate and faster epithelization. In conclusion, therapy wth IVIG should be started within the first 5 days and an high-dosage regimen should be preferred (2.5\u20134 g/kg for adults and 0.25\u20131.5 g/kg in children divided in 3\u20135 days).",
