Previously, the 47 cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to inhibit the 48 replication of diverse nidoviruses (both arteriviruses and coronaviruses), and may thus represent a 49 class of pan-nidovirus inhibitors. Here, using the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus, we have 50 established that resistance to CsA and ALV treatment is associated with adaptive mutations in two 51 trans-membrane subunits of the viral replication complex, nonstructural proteins 2 and 5. This is the 52 first evidence for the involvement of specific replicase subunits of nidoviruses in the mechanism 53 underlying the inhibition of their replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Understanding this mechanism 54 of action is of major importance to guide future drug design, both for nidoviruses and other RNA 55 viruses inhibited by these compounds. 56 57 58 Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is a positive-strand RNA (+RNA) virus that belongs to the 59 arterivirus family in the order Nidovirales, a steadily expanding clade of positive-stranded RNA 60 (+RNA) viruses that also includes the roni-, mesoni-, and coronavirus families 61",

Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus 30 (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence 31 of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the 32 arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or 33 A134V) led to a ~2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations 34 further increased EAV's CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered 35 EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. 36",

Subsequently, adaptive mutations that 116 markedly decreased the sensitivity of EAV replication to CsA treatment were found to map to nsp5, 117 one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase. We could show that CsA treatment 118 interferes with EAV RNA synthesis, and that the CsA-resistance mutations in nsp5 render replication, 119 and in particular RNA synthesis, less sensitive to CsA treatment. Furthermore, we show that resistance 120 to the closely related Cyp inhibitor ALV requires an additional adaptive mutation in nsp2, a second 121 transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase that is essential for both polyprotein processing and 122 RO formation. Our studies implicate both nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the sensitivity 123 of arterivirus replication to cyclophilin inhibitor treatment. Moreover, they suggest that the role of 124 cyclophilins as arterivirus host factors is specifically linked to viral RNA synthesis, possibly through 125 interactions with key players in RO formation. resulting in EAV lineages CsA-1, CsA-2, and CsA-3.

Independently, experiments using the CsA 426 analog ALV pointed in the same direction, in addition to implicating nsp2 in ALV sensitivity and 427 resistance. Substitutions in nsp5 and nsp2 enable EAV to tolerate CsA or ALV concentrations that 428 would normally block virus replication (Figs. 2, 9 and 10) . The largest EC50 increase, about 5-fold, 429 was achieved when multiple substitutions in nsp5 (and nsp2, in the case of ALV) were combined 430 (Table 1 and interaction of these compounds with EAV replicase subunits themselves has not been formally 460 excluded. In any case, our EM analysis of CsA-treated, EAV-infected cells, which were devoid of 461 DMVs (Fig. 5) , confirmed that the drug treatment blocks an early and basic step in the viral replicative 462 cycle, and that this block can apparently be circumvented by the acquisition of a few adaptive 463 mutations in nps5. 464",

            "text": "Four substitutions in nsp5 were implicated in CsA resistance (L8S, Q21R, Y113H, and 465 A134V), of which only the L8 residue is conserved among arteriviruses (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, this 466 residue is also part of a potential CypA binding motif (GPxL, as identified by (Piotukh et al., 2005) ), 467 constituting a potential interaction site between the two proteins. However, during infection, this L8S 468 mutation quickly reverted, and therefore the contribution of the L8S substitution to CsA resistance 469 remains unclear. All other three nsp5 mutations (Q21R, Y113H, and A134V) are present in predicted 470 transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B) , and therefore may not be directly involved in interactions of nsp5 471 with Cyps or other proteins. There is no experimental data available on the membrane topology of 472 nsp5, but upon in silico modeling these nsp5 mutations did not appreciably alter the predicted 473 conformation of the various transmembrane domains (data not shown). In addition, our EM analysis of 474 DMV formation upon rEAV nsp5 QYA infection did not reveal any ultrastructural differences, either in 475 the absence or presence of CsA (Fig 5) . Clearly, more detailed information on the 3D-structure of nsp5 476 is needed to assess the impact of the mutations identified in this study on the protein's conformation(s) 477 and interactions at the molecular level. In analogy with these data, all relevant adaptive mutations in EAV nsp5 map inside the first and last of 502 its four (predicted) transmembrane domains. One possible mechanism is that the adaptive nsp5 503 mutations somehow increase the stability of RTC complexes and thereby counteract the destabilization 504 that may result from CsA penetrating lipid membranes. It has been shown that CsA can be inserted 505 into and destabilize membrane structures, with a preference for sphingomyelin-rich membranes 506 Interestingly, despite the fact that CsA and ALV both are cyclophilin inhibitors, EAV 516 resistance to ALV requires an additional mutation in the nsp2 protease domain PLP2: H114R (Fig 10) . 517",

Briefly, 4 x 10 5 BHK-21 cells in 4-cm 2 wells 214 were infected with rEAV wt or rEAV QYA (MOI 5). At 5.5 h p.i., DMEM containing 8% FCS, 5 \u00b5g/ml 215 dactinomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 8 \u00b5M CsA or 0.02% DMSO (solvent control) was given. At 6.5 h 216 p.i., 100 \u00b5Ci of [ 3 H]uridine was added to 300 \u00b5l of culture medium. Cells were lysed at 7.5 h p.i. and 217 intracellular 3 H-labeled RNAs were isolated (Tripure), separated by denaturing agarose gel 218 electrophoresis, and visualized by fluorography. The total incorporation of 3 H label was determined 219 using liquid scintillation counting. For hybridization analysis of intracellular RNA from EAV-infected 220 cells, RNA was first separated by denaturing RNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the gel 221 was dried and hybridization was performed using a 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5'-222 TTGGTTCCTGGGTGGCTAATAACTACTT -3') recognizing the 3'end of the EAV genome, as 223described previously (van Hemert et al.CsA-resistant EAV mutants. Previously, we showed that low-micromolar CsA 230 concentrations can effectively block EAV and PRRSV replication in cultured cells (de Wilde et al., 231 2013a). We now aimed to investigate the mechanism-of-action by which arterivirus infection is 232 inhibited in the presence of this cyclophilin inhibitor. To this end, wt EAV (strain Bucyrus; MOI 233 0.005) was serially passaged in Huh7 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA (4 to 234 20 \u00b5M). Three independent virus lineages were generated (named EAV CsA-1 to -3), which exhibited 235 clearly decreasing sensitivity to CsA (Fig. 2A). By passage 7 (P7), all three lineages replicated in the 236 presence of 20 \u00b5M CsA (data not shown), a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than the EC50 237 value observed when using wtEAV (Fig. 2B and (de Wilde et al., 2013a)). The CsA sensitivity of the 238 three lineages was measured in an assay that is based on (the inhibition of) EAV-induced CPE in 239 Huh7 cells. Following infection with an MOI of 0.05 in the presence of 0.4 to 50 \u00b5M CsA, cell 240 viability was assayed at 3 days p.i. CsA doses above 12.5 \u00b5M appeared to be cytotoxic, as the viability 241 of mock-infected CsA-treated cells dropped below 85% compared to Huh7 cells not treated with CsA 242 (Fig. 2B; light grey line). The CPE induced by wtEAV infection was inhibited by CsA with an EC50 243 value of 2.4 \u00b5M, whereas treatment with 3.1 \u00b5M CsA fully blocked the development of virus-induced 244 CPE. This was in line with our previous results in EAV-infected BHK-21 cells, in which treatment 245 with 4 \u00b5M CsA resulted in a 4-log reduction of viral progeny (de Wilde et al., 2013a). Whereas seven 246passages in the absence of CsA did not alter the drug sensitivity of the wtEAV control (EC50 2.1 \u00b5M), 247 P7 virus of the CsA-treated EAV lineages CsA-1 to -3 had become five-fold less sensitive to the 248 compound (Fig. 2B and",

The CsA resistance of rEAV QYA was analyzed in more 308 detail by infecting Huh7 cells in the presence or absence of 4 \u00b5M CsA. Upon high-MOI inoculation 309 (MOI 3), the replication kinetics of rEAV wt and rEAV QYA in the absence of CsA were very similar 310 (Fig. 4A; solid lines). Progeny was released from rEAV wt -and rEAV QYA -infected cells from 12 h p.i. 311 onwards, with rEAV QYA titers being only slightly reduced compared to those for rEAV wt . In the 312 presence of 4 \u00b5M CsA, rEAV wt was essentially unable to replicate (Fig. 4A; black dashed line) while 313 rEAV QYA was able to produce infectious progeny, albeit with a delay compared to the CsA-free 314 infection (Fig. 4A; red dashed line). Subsequently, the CsA resistance of rEAV QYA was further 315 confirmed in a low-MOI infection experiment (MOI 0.01) in Huh7 cells (Fig. 4B): a titer of about 10 4 316 PFU/ml was obtained for the mutant in the presence of 4 \u00b5M CsA, while rEAV wt infectious progeny 317 was not detected under the same conditions. 318 319 Neither CsA treatment nor nsp5 mutations affect the morphology of EAV-induced replication 320 organelles. It was previously reported that Cyp inhibitor treatment affects the morphology of the 321 'membranous web', the RO that is formed upon HCV infection and with which viral RNA synthesis is 322 associated (Chatterji et al., 2015; Madan et al., 2014). It was striking that the EAV mutations that 323 promote CsA-resistance all map to the nsp5 transmembrane protein, which has been suggested to play 324 a regulatory role in the formation of arterivirus ROs (van der Hoeven et al., 2016), of which the 325 peculiar DMVs are a key feature (Pedersen 1999, Knoops 2012). We therefore used electron 326 microscopy to investigate whether CsA treatment or the mutations in nsp5 affect EAV-induced DMV 327 formation.

            "text": "3). We previously showed that CsA inhibits EAV RNA synthesis and hypothesized that 431 this may be the major determinant for its inhibitory effect (de Wilde et al., 2013a). Indeed, a 432 combination of three of the acquired CsA resistance mutations in nsp5 (Q21R, Y113H, and A134V) 433 facilitated a certain level of EAV RNA synthesis in the presence of a CsA dose that blocks wt virus 434 activity. This was observed in both virus-infected cells and an in vitro assay for EAV RNA synthesis 435 (Fig. 7). 436 Unfortunately, arterivirus nsp5 has not been studied in great detail and little is known about its 437 functions and interactions during virus replication. The protein is one of three ORF1a-encoded 438 transmembrane subunits that are presumed to drive the formation of the membranous ROs supporting 439 viral RTC activity in the infected cell (Knoops et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 1999; van der Hoeven et 440 al., 2016). In expression systems, nsp2 and nsp3 interact and their combined expression suffices to 441 induce the conversion of ER membranes into double-membrane vesicles that strikingly resemble those 442 observed in arterivirus-infected cells. Although nsp5 appears to be dispensable for the basic 443 interactions leading to these membrane transformations (Snijder et al., 2001), the protein was recently 444 postulated to play a regulatory role by modulating membrane curvature and DMV formation (van der 445 Hoeven et al., 2016). 446The 162-amino acid nsp5 of EAV is largely hydrophobic and contains four predicted 447 membrane-spanning domains and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 and (van der Hoeven et al., 4482016)). In infected cells, nsp5 is mainly present within a number of long-lived processing 449 intermediates of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins(Snijder et al., 1994; Wassenaar et al.,  450  1997), in particular nsp5-7 and nsp3-8, but also larger intermediates. The latter extend into the 451ORF1b-encoded part of the replicase polyprotein, which includes key enzymes for arterivirus RNA 452 synthesis(Snijder et al., 1994;Wassenaar et al., 1997). Consequently, nsp5 may have an important 453 role as an 'interaction platform' that could target and/or anchor other RTC subunits to membranes. 454Being part of several larger processing intermediates, nsp5 may potentially perform such a role in cis, 455 prior to the proteolytic release of those other subunits from nsp5-containing precursors. Obviously, 456 also host cell proteins involved in arterivirus RNA synthesis are likely to become associated with the 457 membrane-bound viral RTC, and may thus interact with nsp5. Such factors may include CypA and 458 other members of the Cyp family that bind CsA and ALV, although the possibility of a direct 459",

            "text": "478We previously postulated a role for CypA in EAV RTC formation or function, upon 479 demonstrating the cosedimentation of CypA with EAV RTCs in density gradients. Interestingly, no 480CypA cosedimentation with RTCs was detected in the presence of CsA (de Wilde et al., 2013a). 481Unfortunately, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from either ectopic expression of 482 the EAV nsp2-7 polyprotein in 293T cells or EAV-infected cells, could not confirm an interaction 483 between nsp5 and CsA, even when using mild conditions for cell lysis and immunoprecipitation (data 484 not shown). This could obviously be due to technical reasons, e.g. the interaction being very weak or 485 short-lived but an alternative explanation may be that the interaction of CypA with the EAV RTC is 486 not directly via nsp5, or that it depends on factors that were lacking in our assays.487 Although a direct interaction between an EAV nsp and CypA could not be established, 488 efficient EAV replication is dependent on the presence of CypA, as it is severely reduced in cells 489 depleted for CypA (Fig 6; (de Wilde et al., 2013a; de Wilde et al., 2018b)). For HCV, it was 490 postulated that the interaction between CypA and NS5A is involved in the formation and stabilization 491 of the RO, the so-called 'membranous web' with which viral RNA synthesis is associated (Chatterji et 492 al., 2015; Madan et al., 2014). A direct interaction has been demonstrated between CypA and the 493 proline-rich domain 2 of NS5A (Foster et al., 2011; Ngure et al., 2016). Presumably, CypA catalyzes 494 the proper folding of NS5A, which in turn enhances the direct binding of RNA to NS5A, or 495 recruitment of the NS5B-RdRp to the membrane structures, ultimately leading to efficient RNA 496 synthesis (Coelmont et al., 2010). HCV mutations associated with resistance to Cyp inhibitors map to 497 NS5A, close to the cleavage site between NS5A and NS5B, and either slow down processing of the 498 NS5A-5B junction or render replication less dependent on CypA (Kaul et al., 2009). Interestingly, 499 NS5A mutations that confer resistance to Cyp inhibitors do not reduce CypA-NS5A binding (Badillo 500 et al., 2017). 501",

            "text": "de Wilde et al., 2013b). The 159 cytotoxic effects of treatment with compound only were monitored in parallel in plates containing 160 mock-infected cells. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) and the compound-specific 161 toxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration; CC50) were calculated with GraphPad Prism 6 software, using 162 the non-linear regression model. 163 Identification of adaptive mutations in the EAV genome. To isolate viral RNA, Huh7 cells (10-cm 2 165 dish) were infected with wild-type (wt) EAV, wtEAV P7, EAV CsA lineages, or EAV ALV lineages 166 (MOI of 0.1). Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37\u00b0C, lysed in 1 ml of TriPure (Sigma Aldrich), and 167 intracellular RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription 168 (RT) was performed with the ThermoScript\u2122 RT-PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific) according 169 to the manufacturer's instructions, using random hexamers (Promega) and 10 \u00b5M of primer 5'-170 CGCCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'. Subsequently, the complete EAV genome was 171 amplified as seven PCR products and sequenced (primer sequences used in RT, PCR and sequencing 172 are available upon request). 173 EAV reverse genetics. Resistance-associated adaptive mutations (listed in Table 2) were introduced 175 into shuttle plasmids by standard site-directed PCR mutagenesis. After sequence verification, 176 restriction fragments containing the desired mutations were transferred to full-length EAV cDNA 177 clone pEAN900, a derivative of pEAV030 (van Dinten et al., 1997) containing a few translationally 178 silent mutations to engineer restriction sites. Virus derived from clone pEAN900 has a wt phenotype, 179 as confirmed by a side-by-side comparison with pEAV030-derived virus in growth curve experiments 180 and plaque assays (data not shown). In vitro transcribed RNA derived from wt or mutant pEAN900 181 was electroporated into BHK-21 cells using Amaxa Nucleofector technology (Lonza), as described 182 previously (Beerens and Snijder, 2007). Recombinant virus was harvested upon complete CPE, 183 typically between 48 and 72 h post transfection (p.t.). The presence of the engineered mutations was 184 confirmed by performing one additional virus passage and sequencing RT-PCR products obtained 185 after isolation and RT-PCR amplification of intracellular viral RNA. 186 Electron microscopy. Huh-7 cells were infected with rEAV wt or rEAV QYA , or were mock-infected, 188 and either treated with 8 \u00b5M CsA at 1 h p.i. or left untreated. Cells were fixed at 11 (no CsA) or 14 h 189 p.i. (8 \u00b5M CsA) in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. Subsequently, 190 samples were stained during 1-h incubation steps, first with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and 191 then with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (70% to 100% 192 ethanol) and embedded in Epon LX-112 resin (Ladd Research) that was polymerized at 60\u00b0C. Sections 193 of 100 nm thickness were collected on carbon-coated pioloform EM grids and post-stained with lead 194 citrate and a saturated aqueous solution of uranyl acetate. Images were collected on a Tecnai12 TWIN 195 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific (formerly FEI)) operating at 120 kV using a OneView 196 4k high frame-rate camera (Gatan). 197 Isolation of EAV RTC-containing replication organelles and in vitro RNA synthesis assays. 199",
