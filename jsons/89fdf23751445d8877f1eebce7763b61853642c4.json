It describes how one such workshop, the 2 nd Academic-Practitioner Research with Impact Workshop focusing on the design and decision making for customer experience, co-hosted in Manchester on 18 th and 19 th of June 2018 by Alliance Manchester Business School and Loughborough University's Centre for Service Management (CSM), was delivered. The key processes for success and issues to consider for future such events are discussed. The workshop resulted in 8 papers (six theoretical and two empirical). This Special Issue advances current understanding of CE through the research considering the role of technology (AI and big data) in CE research, atypical CE (vulnerability, deviance behaviours and service failure and recovery) and focusing on important organizational and B2B issues (business model innovation, and CEM in business markets).",

Benoit et. al. (2019) also discuss several ways in which the observed disconnect could be overcome. One of the presented solutions is to organise co-creation workshops, which bring \"practitioners and academics with an interest in a general research topic together to jointly develop research questions.\" (Benoit et. al., 2019, 533) . A further advantage of workshops is the potential to make the academic teams interdisciplinary with potential for more creative solutions that can 'make a difference' (Gustafsson & Bowen, 2017) . This Journal of Business Research Special Issue emerged from such a workshop, which will be discussed in the next sections.",

            "text": "Companies need to constantly re-innovate themselves and have limited resources to do so. The underlying idea of academic-practitioner workshops is that a company articulates a problem and academics seek to solve it in novel ways. Academics are able to give these companies a rare gift of unbiased input to this problem as, unlike initiatives to create value via co-opetition, no-one is trying to monetise on a solution to a company problem. Academics also bring a more holistic understanding of how business activity generates value. For example, Kunz et al. (2019) highlight that whilst business publications focus on technology, scientific service research focuses more on customer-related technology application. The result of a workshop like this is a typical win-win situation. Academics are given a relevant problem to solve with the possibility of receiving industry data while practitioners get access to unbiased consultation at a very low cost. Attendance at the workshop also gives practitioners the luxury of time and space, away from their normal working environment, to reflect on longer-term strategic planning and share and exchange their ideas in a stimulating environment, with effective and informed academic teams. As industry and academy are at very different timelines, industry tend to want a quick solution while the academic publication process is slow, the risk of revealing proprietary information is low. At the same time, if an earlier reporting cycle can be built into the process, then academic-practitioner workshops can successfully accelerate the ideas/solution phase, providing a two-phased output process, capable of delivering the competing dual desirable outcomes of rigour and relevance (Gustafsson & Bowen, 2017) . discussion with the practitioner representatives before the workshop, eight themes emerged, appropriate academic chairpersons were then identified and invited to lead the eight themes and help groups of invited academics to work on the eight areas. These chairpersons held online meetings with representatives from each of the companies involved to better understand the issues the companies faced. The event was widely promoted through relevant networks and academics applied to join the eight groups. The chairpersons and organizing committee allocated places to the strongest and most suitable applicants for each topic. The organizations involved welcomed the mix of established and early career academics because they felt that it would lead to more creative and innovative outcomes.",

The practitioners valued the event and presentations, highlighting that they lack the time to read multiple studies and valued the opportunity to be introduced to key research. They appreciated having space and time to reflect and think more strategically about the issues they faced.

Customer experience (CE) is an important topic for academics and practitioners alike. Increasingly, organisations strive to remain or become more competitive, differentiate themselves by delivering exceptional customer service and delight, and endeavour to build emotional relationships with customers leading to engagement and advocacy. Holbrook and Hirschman (1982) introduced the term CE into the (consumer) marketing domain in the early 80s (although the roots can be traced back to the 60s or even 50s), the concept gained in popularity in the late 90s due to Gilmore's (1998, 1999) influential HBR article and book on the experience economy. Service researchers have also had a long on-going interest in CE, with it being identified early on as a prominent area for service research activity (Fisk, Brown, & Bitner 1993) .",

This in turn sparked a renewed research interest among the academic community, resulting in publications in leading journals (e.g., Lemon & Verhoef, 2016) . CE has been defined as a \"multidimensional construct focusing on a customer's cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social responses to a firm's offerings during the customer's entire purchase journey\" (Lemon & Verhoef, 2016, 71) . The idea of a customer journey is important as it shows the dynamic character of CE. A customer journey can be seen as a series of service encounters and each encounter or touchpoint needs to be properly managed as they all have consequences for customer satisfaction and loyalty and willingness to continue the relationship with a company (Bitner, 1990; Bitner, Booms, & Tetreault, 1990) . What we see now with the renewed interesting in CE is that the concept in itself is multifaceted and goes beyond attitudes, with large parts of the customer journey taking place at touchpoints that are outside an organization's control. Added to that are the technological advancements that enable companies to follow the customer journeys both off-line and on-line, but also to capture new metrics such as attitudes as expressed through facial expressions.",

Baker, Simos Chari, Ahmad Daryanto, Julija Dzenkovska, Kemefasu Ifie, Bryan Lukas and Gianfranco Walsh. Big grocery retailers are under increasing threat by deep-discounters. In the UK alone, the big 4 grocers (Tesco, Sainsburys, Asda and Morrsions) have a combined market share of more than 70%, but are expected to lose \u00a31.9bn worth of market share over the next five years as discounters will continue to grow (Nazir, 2020) . Big grocers are therefore under increasing pressure to find new ways of improving their customer's shopping experience in general and to lure them away from the deep-discounters in particular. Tesco, which is the largest grocer in the UK (Wunsch, 2020) , recently introduced so-called discount venture brands (DVBs). DVBs are a specific type of budget private labels, which are characterised by the following elements: a complete absence of brand owner elements, a deep-discount price that allows them to compete with competitors' budget price points, and a more upmarket look compared to conventional budget brands. The aim of their empirical study is to examine whether retail customers perceive DVBs to offer them greater value-for-money than conventional budget brands and whether customers also perceive the retailer brand to offer them greater value-formoney. Drawing on the concept of self-congruity, the authors use an experimental research design that involved 505 participants. The results show that DVBs are likely to be less effective drivers of value-for-money perceptions of retailer and product brands than conventional budget brands. Retailers should therefore use caution when they launch DVBs to complement or even replace their conventional budget brands.",

            "text": "Research with Impact Workshop was successful due to implementation of key learning from the 1 st workshop and the engagement and commitment of all actors involved. Key processes involved (i) pre-planning a long way in advance (comparable to an academic conference), (ii) iterative, ongoing managed discussion and co-ordination with practitioners to co-develop the workshop themes, to ensure that the focus provided value for them, (iii) securing a potential special issue from a widely respected, service relevant, journal with a wide subject remit, that values both inter-disciplinary and relevant research, highly. This latter commitment then ensured full engagement from (iv) a team of committed academic leads, willing to engage in project scoping with practitioners before the event, and to play a key role in driving the research development at the workshop and after the event. Representatives from all five companies attended the first day of the workshop. Practitioners from three of the five companies were able to attend the full two-day workshop (practitioner attendance was only required for the first day) and all three stated, unprompted, that they wanted their organisation to be invited, as soon as the date of the next workshop is confirmed. Subsequent implications of the workshop for practitioners confirmed via follow-up impact interview, included: the value of the unique opportunity to engage with academics and reframe problems from a new perspective; benefits of adoption of fresh approaches for reviewing problems; the generation of thought provoking ideas; and value of collaborative working. A key action for one was a review of their definition of 'vulnerable' customers to make it more encompassing to include temporally dependent vulnerability (e.g. lost, upset, ill customers), an outcome that may have helped this organisation to prepare for the impact of Covid-19 on their customer base.",

Secondly, whilst there was a degree of inter-disciplinary make-up demonstrated in the academic teams, there was clearly greater scope for involvement of academics from a wider set of research domains. As the scope of service research widens still further (Gustafsson & Bowen, 2017) , this becomes ever more important and we will need to work harder to look beyond traditional networks to seek future attendees, whilst at the same time balancing a need for customer experience expertise based in traditional services literature. Finally, the balance between relevance and rigour is always difficult to achieve (Gustafsson & Bowen, 2017) . The temporally limited nature of practitioner workshop events tends to result in greater numbers of theoretical contributions than empirical works and they tip the balance slightly in favour of relevance, although the involvement of relatively large academic teams helped to also deliver rigour in a timely fashion. Perhaps via future events it may become possible to deliver longitudinal empirical studies that can also deliver greater rigour in conjunction with great relevance.",

            "text": "The first paper entitled \"Customer experience management in the age of big data analytics: a strategic framework\" is authored by Maria Holmlund, Yves Van Vaerenbergh, Robert Ciuchita, Annika Ravald, Panagiotis Sarantopoulos, Francisco Villarroel Ordenes, and Mohamed Zaki. In their conceptual paper, the authors show how big data analytics(BDA)    can help companies better understand customer journeys and make better decisions to enhance CE. For most companies, it is still a challenge to collect big data from numerous channels, touchpoints and devices. However, even if companies succeed in collecting data, they may still struggle with gaining valuable customer insights. Analytics can then help making sense of the collected (big) data. The authors present a strategic framework that shows how BDA can be used for managing and improving CE. In particular, they organize different types of CE along two dimensions (solicited versus unsolicited, structured versus unstructured) and explain how companies can use these types of data, which are generated along the customer journey, as a source for CE analytics, which can then lead to three types of CE insights (attitudinal/psychographic, behavioural, and market insights). Holmlund et al.then explain how the gained insights can help companies to enhance CE by linking CE insights to actions. The authors also show how managers can implement the framework by following a step-by-step guide.Hannes Fleischer, Sahar Mousavi, Julia R\u00f6tzmeier-Keuper, and Rui Sousa. Consumers do not always have positive experiences. They sometimes feel powerless and lacking control, resulting in a perceived vulnerability. Companies have many ways of reaching out to their customers through different channels (offline, online, mobile or social channels) and channel design initiatives could help address customer vulnerability across the customer journey.There is currently only very limited research on how the design of channels, which is an important element of service design strategies, can be used to ease or preferably even prevent states and perceptions of vulnerability. The authors address this important knowledge gap by presenting a conceptual framework explaining both the causes for, and consequences of, vulnerability. In particular, the authors offer three relevant channel design strategies that service providers could use to reduce or prevent vulnerability: offering flexibility through multiple multichannel paths, providing guidance through constrained channel paths and proactively initiating interactions. Hogreve et al. also make an important contribution to the customer journey literature by recommending the integration of new elements into customer journey maps, which should result in a better understanding of the experience of vulnerable customers.\"Customer deviance: a framework, prevention strategies, and opportunities for future research\" is the title of the fourth paper. The authors are Paul W Fombelle, Clay M.Customer misbehaviour or deviance is a good example for that phenomenon. It involves activities, both online and offline, that negatively impact the experience of employees and other customers and that deplete company resources, lead to lost revenue and the need to implement counter measures. Examples for deviant customer behaviour would be shoplifting, illegal software, music or movie downloads, vandalism and customer rage.Kranzbuehler et al. (2018) distinguish between consumer and organizational perspectives on CE. They believe that a connection between both perspectives is currently lacking. Fombelle et al. provide this connection by presenting a comprehensive framework that first explains the customer deviance process (triggers, behaviours, and consequences) and then discusses several strategies (social, design, and technological) that companies can take to prevent customer deviance. The article concludes with an overview of future research questions.Anthony Grimes and Liliane Abboud are the authors of the fifth paper entitled \"Stepping out of the shadows: supporting actors' strategies for managing end user experiences in service ecosystems\". Companies cannot fully control customer journeys and CE",
