Diagnostic radiology, as a largely non-patient facing specialty, is unique in that it can be practiced away from where the patient is being diagnosed and treated and that this off-site reading has been part of standard radiology practice since at least the late 1990's [1] . The two main ways off-site reading is conducted is through at-home reading by radiologists who are members of the practice (internal teleradiology) or by contracting corporate teleradiology practices (external teleradiology).",

Before the COVID19 pandemic, teleradiology was often used for call and overnight shifts; however, we observed an overall increase in the proportion of practices installing new home workstations (65.2%; 75/115) and switching normal daytime shifts to internal teleradiology (73.6%; 128/74) in a similar fashion across the different geographical regions [1] . This distribution demonstrated highest transitions to teleradiology in the North and lowest in the South and West. Although there was no correlation in teleradiology practice adoption with reported hospital cases, there is significant correlation with CDC reported state-wide cases. Please note, state-wide cases were collected daily [5]. This implies broad adoption of home workstations early in the pandemic. This broad adoption may have been influenced by government policies of promotion of social distancing and government regulations against non-essential cases, which were first enacted in the Northeast and more slowly in the South [4] . Although there was a higher number of home workstation installations at hospital-owned practices and academic centers, this is likely due to the 1.5 and 1.9 times more pre-COVID-19 installed stations at private practices and community institutions, respectively, from the data collected. Increased installations at groups with \u226511 radiologists may signal a manpower resource issue, with larger groups more able to move a larger percentage of their workforce home while keeping the minimum in the hospital to staff procedures and contrast reactions. However, regardless of practice size, all groups increased internal teleradiology.",

There was a significantly higher desire among community institutions (63.6%; 35/59) to continue internal teleradiology post-pandemic compared to academic institutions (46.2%; 40/56). Conceivably, academic institutions require the physical presence of radiologists due to more multidisciplinary activities and academic obligations such as research and teaching. There may be a persistent negative perception of teleradiology in academia, tying it to commoditization, purported for the past two decades by many influential academics [1, 2, 5] . These influencers may have significantly shifted the conversation and sentiment, particularly in academic circles, towards a defensive position against teleradiology, which may still be pervasive today and help explain the significant difference between academic and community institutions.",

While reasons for these differences are unknown, teleradiology is inherently practiced in isolation and while technology has allowed for greater efficiency and ubiquitous use for remote image interpretation, policies and procedures utilizing the same technology for greater clinician-clinician interaction over remote sessions are lacking. This lack of real-time, face-to-face interaction over a remote session may contribute to the perceived decrease in rapport among some respondents.",
