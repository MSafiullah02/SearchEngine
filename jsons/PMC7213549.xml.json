Two independent translators, one subject matter expert (a psychologist) and other experienced in culture and linguistic distinctions in English and Bangla, translated the seven-item scale into Bangla (i.e., forward translation). Both the versions were compiled and further translated back into English by another professional translator with medical translation proficiency and by one bilingual individual who had not seen the English version of the FCV-19S (i.e., back translation). After compiling the back translated versions, all were compared and submitted to an expert panel of five members. The panel scrutinized and finalized the items and all seven questions were retained. Pretesting was conducted among 140 individuals using online platforms across different age groups. The suggested changes were made by the research team. The final version of the questionnaire was then administrated on the large-scale study.",

            "text": "Descriptive statistics were used to describe study participants\u2019 characteristics. Continuous data were reported as means (and SDs) and categorical data were reported as frequencies and percentages. There are two approaches for assessing psychometric characteristics of a scale: classical test theory (CTT) and modern test theory. CTT has been widely used to assess psychometric properties of various self-reported measures, and assumes that the item responses of a scale should be summed to compute a score. This score is a class true score (a representation of assessed outcome: in this study, fear). However, CTT has some limitations including (i) assuming a linear relationship between latent variables and observed scores and (ii) being dependent on sample and group. However, modern test theory such as item response theory (IRT) assumes that the relationship between latent variables and observed scores is not necessarily linear (Wirth and Edwards 2007). Instead, it could vary from one person to another. Several statistics were performed to assess CTT including item ceiling and floor effects (the percentage of participants who obtained highest and lowest possible scores, respectively). Values lower than 50% are acceptable (Strober et al. 2013), internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 > 0.7 is acceptable), corrected item-total correlation (values > 0.4 are acceptable) (Pakpour et al. 2014), average variance extracted (AVE; values > 0.5 indicate satisfactory convergent reliability), composite reliability (CR; values higher than 0.6 indicate acceptable reliability), standard error of measurement (smaller values indicating better reliability), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The uni-dimensional factor stricture of the FCV-19S was evaluated using CFA with diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator. Several indices were used to assess model fit including comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker\u2013Lewis index (TLI) > 0.9; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08; weighted root mean square residual (WRMSR) < 1.0; and non-significant chi-square (Li et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017).",

Item difficulty was evaluated using logit (an interval scale) with higher scores indicating more difficult items. Information-weighted fit statistic (infit) mean square (MnSq), and outlier-sensitive fit statistic (outfit) MnSq were used to assess item validity. Values ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 are considered acceptable good fit. Values greater than 0.7 for both item and person separation reliability are considered to be acceptable. Item and person separation index values are considered to be acceptable if they are greater than 2.",

Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to assess whether FCV-19S items are invariant across age and gender groups. A DIF value of 0.5 or higher indicates substantial DIF (i.e., invariance) across two groups.

However, factor loadings of the Bangla version of the FCV-19S were greater than those of both Iranian and Italian versions. The potential reason could be due to mean age of the sample and large sample size of the present study (N = 8677; mean age = 26.53 years, SD = 9.09) compared with the studies in Iran (N = 717; mean age = 31.25 years, SD = 12.68) and Italy (N = 249, mean age = 34.5 years, SD = 12.21; predominantly female sample). However, it can be argued that when there is a global pandemic, people at all ages feel threatened and answer questions in a similar way. Furthermore, the results obtained from the DIF analysis showed that the Bangla version of the fear questionnaire could be used in the general population irrespective of their age. In the present study, women reported higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than men. Fear can be an emotional response to an external factor. Gender differences caused by a reaction to an external threatening agent are not new. Previous studies have shown that women report more fear of contamination and disgust sensitivity than males (e.g., Olatunji et al. 2005).",

First, fear in the present study was assessed using a self-reported measure that can be influenced by factors such as social desirability, memory recall, and other common method biases. Studies using other methodologies are recommended (e.g., in-depth qualitative interviews, diary studies). Second, although a large sample size was included in the present study, the sample was a convenience sample and was not necessarily representative of the general population of Bangladesh. Future studies using nationally representative studies are needed to confirm the results reported here. Third, the study design was cross-sectional, and therefore, the associations found between variables provide little insight into causality. Future research should include longitudinal designs to assess (as aforementioned) relationships between depression and fear of COVID-19. Finally, this study did not examine the stability of the FCV-19S over time. Future research should therefore incorporate test-retest reliability measures into the design of their studies.
