With the evolution of digital technologies, many opportunities are realised through the application of the digital technologies [2, 3]. Some of these include cyber-physical systems where control and monitoring are done by computer-based algorithms e.g. autonomous vehicles, the internet of things creating a connected world e.g. enabling smart cities, cloud computing providing on-demand availability of data storage and computing power and cognitive computing e.g. artificial intelligence [4, 5]. The ability of organisations to apply and optimise Industry 4.0 technologies require digital citizens to have the knowledge and skills to effectively use and apply these digital technologies [6]. Both from a commercial perspective, as well as a knowledge and skill outlook, digital technologies enable two options: firstly, they provide multiple options for an organisation to embrace digital transformation and secondly, they enable a world of visual and experiential learning in order to enhance skills and knowledge [6, 7].",

Knowledge visualisation on the other hand is not as mature [12, 13] and therefore, lacks a generic set of guidelines [10, 14]. An interconnected field and predecessor of knowledge visualisation is information visualisation and both these fields are utilising our natural abilities to successfully process visual representations. Although both these fields make use of our natural visual abilities, the way of utilising these abilities differ in both fields: Information visualisation intends to examine a large amount of abstract data to obtain new perceptions or to make the data more approachable. Knowledge visualisation, on the other hand, intends to enhance the transfer and creation of knowledge amongst people by providing a richer approach to communicate what they know. While information visualisation assists in improving the retrieval, access and presentation of information from large data sets, knowledge visualisation is mainly concerned with increasing knowledge-intensive communication amongst people [15].",

Based on this definition, Renaud and van Biljon [10] extended the definition as \u201cthe use of graphical means to communicate experiences, insights and potentially complex knowledge. Such means should be flexible enough to accommodate changing insights, and facilitate conversations. Such representations facilitate and expedite the creation and transfer of knowledge between people by improving and promoting knowledge processing and comprehension\u201d [10: 3]. The aim of knowledge visualisation is to use visualisation to promote effective and efficient transfer of knowledge from one person to another [12, 13, 16]. Proper implementation of knowledge visualisation has the potential to utilise key strengths of the human cognitive processing system to improve communication and the transfer and sharing of knowledge [15, 17].",

Information is data with relevance and purpose added, while knowledge comes with insights, framed experiences, intuition, judgement and values and encompasses the scope of understanding and skills that are created by people through cognitive processes [20]. Knowledge can be categorised as either being explicit (has been articulated) or implicit (less tangible, deeply embedded knowledge) [21]. Tacit knowledge, as a dimension of implicit knowledge, is personal and context-specific, and therefore hard to communicate and formalise [21]. In order to act on information, a person should internalise the information and achieve this by progressing through knowledge conversion processes namely socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation [21]. Socialisation ensures that knowledge is acquired, after which externalisation enables students to express their tacit knowledge (mental models and know-how). Combination is the process of integrating concepts, while internalisation is closely related to learning-by-doing, or experiential learning [21]. This process of knowledge application ensures that knowledge is advanced through practice, guidance, imitation and observation [19].",

The explanatory power element ensures that knowledge visualisation has both explanatory and descriptive value. Descriptive value gives details and describes the knowledge that the target audience needs to understand, while explanatory value gives the reasons for it. In the organisational context, its application is closely related to whether knowledge recall is required, whether new insights are shared or whether existing knowledge is elaborated upon. By associating knowledge visualisation with familiar real world images, the target audience is enabled to recognise and interpret visuals rather than to have to remember and recall meaning. The legend element provides the information needed for the knowledge visualisation to make sense and assists in explaining meaning and interpretation. The process of transferring knowledge from one part of the organisation to another by organising, creating, capturing or distributing knowledge and ensuring it is available for future users, depicts the knowledge transfer cognitive process elements.
