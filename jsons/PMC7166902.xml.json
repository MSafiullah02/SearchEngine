            "text": "The battle against viral infections is ferocious. Since viruses are developing resistance to therapy, novel antiviral therapeutic modalities are in great demand. The currently approved antiviral therapies are based on the use of small molecular weight drugs, utilization of proteins simulating the innate immune response, and the adaptive immune system for both passive and active vaccination 1. Recently, an antisense drug against viral infection has also been approved, suggesting that newly developed approaches are acceptable. The first drug using antisense technology, Fomivirsen (Vitravene), developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals, was approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. In general, small molecular weight drugs are mainly used today for chronic viral disease, although there are exceptions such as the anti\u2010influenza compound, Oseltamivir/Tamiflu, which is used for acute infection. Passive and active vaccination approaches are being developed for the prevention of severe acute diseases (in this case, there are also exceptions, such as life administration of anti\u2010hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies to liver transplant patients at risk for HBV infection recurrence). The development and use of specific antiviral drugs and vaccines have been slower than expected and face major challenges. One particular example is the sluggish progress in generating effective drugs against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), even though the genomic sequence of the virus was unfolded over 15 years ago. HIV drug development also faces major drawbacks. Although HIV replication is efficiently inhibited by the combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), long\u2010term complications of HAART include significant morbidity on the one hand, and the generation of multi\u2010drug\u2010resistant HIV strains on the other in a large proportion of patients.",

The need for preventive and effective vaccines remains as much a requisite today as it was in previous times in the history of mankind. Indeed, at the beginning of the previous century, the world suffered devastating viral infection pandemics such as the one that occurred in 1918 where a quarter of the world population fell ill and the death toll reached over 25 million people from acute influenza infection. Today, the achievement of peak vaccine efficacy to treat influenza stands at 75% among those under 65 years old and just 35% among the elderly. Even today, the annual death toll from acute influenza infection in the USA tops 20,000 in spite of national vaccination programs. Thus, different strategies are currently being suggested in an effort to be prepared for future pandemics 2, and these include the development of escape mutants (antigenic drift) and reassortment of genetic segments of different quasispecies of the same virus or of different viruses (antigenic shift). Presently, human viral pathogens are spreading worldwide, such as the much publicized menacing spread of the avian flu which is reported to have expanded to remote sites of Russia and Kazakhstan from the South\u2010East, posing a major health threat to the entire world.",

The genome of RNA viruses, especially with plus polarity, serves both as mRNA and as a replication template. Many research groups applied the siRNA method to inhibit replication of viruses in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of an efficient cell culture system for growing HCV, the sensitivity of HCV to RNAi was shown in the replicon\u2010based system. An HCV replicon is derived from an HCV consensus genome that was cloned from a viral RNA isolated from an infected human and used to construct subgenomic selectable replicons. Upon transfection of these subgenomic selectable constructs into a cell line, these RNAs were found to replicate to high levels. In several studies, siRNAs were directed against different targets in the virus genome 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. For example, siRNA specific for the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the HCV genome, introduced into Huh7 cells carrying the replicon system, inhibits HCV replication by up to 90% 20, as measured by the expression level of the replicon luciferase reporter gene. siRNAs targeting the viral polymerase NS5B region reduced expression of NS5B\u2010Luc chimera in mice 27 or in the replicon system in vitro. Other studies that target other regions of the HCV genome reported a significant decline in the level of HCV proteins and the level of both the sense and antisense RNA strands 25.

Likewise, expression vectors of siRNAs specific for two different regions of the WNV genome protected 293T cells from WNV infection, and significantly reduced viral RNA replication and virus production 35. Coxackievirus B3 (CVB3), a member of the Picornaviridae family, is a major cause of many human diseases, such as meningioencephalitis and myocarditis. Synthetic siRNA targeted to the VP1 or to the viral polymerase showed antiviral effects in infected HeLa cells by inducing a significant reduction of viral replication 37. The foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication was inhibited in BHK\u201021 cells by siRNAs targeting various conserved regions of the FMDV genome 38. Multiple siRNAs have been used to target multiple conserved viral genes that are essential for virus replication, including a long 5\u2032\u2010non\u2010coding region, a short 3\u2032\u2010non\u2010coding region, the viral protein VPg, the viral polymerase, and the viral capsid protein VP4. The combination of those siRNAs gave rise to a 10\u20131,000\u2010fold inhibition in virus yield by specific inhibition of viral replication 38. The antiviral properties of RNAi have not been assessed in comparison for their effectiveness upon targeting the different intracellular stages of the viral life cycle. However, from current reports, we could surmise that targeting viral replication, similar to what has been described in several other types of antiviral methods, would probably be the suggested approach to suppress viral infection. Replication of DNA viruses can be inhibited by targeting their viral mRNA, whereas replication of RNA viruses can be inhibited by targeting either their mRNAs or their viral RNA, as was elegantly demonstrated for HIV 39.",

They showed a significant reduction in the number of viral particles produced in MA104, an infected monkey kidney cell line. Moreover, most of the viral particles that were produced were poorly infectious 40. However, there are only few reports assessing specifically the potential of the RNAi effect on viral assembly 41.

Using a pool of siRNAs to simultaneously target multiple sites in the viral genome can prevent the emergence of these resistant viruses 42, 43. Another approach that may partially solve this problem is targeting cellular factors rather than viral genes. During their life cycle, viruses apply cell membrane receptors for penetration, and cellular transcription factors for viral replication, harnessing very efficiently the cellular transcription and translation machinery for their life cycle. Targeting those cellular genes may be another strategy for inhibition of viruses. And indeed, Zhang et al., for example, succeeded in suppressing the replication of HCV in the replicon system by the expression of siRNAs against cellular cofactors that are needed for viral replication, the polypyrimidine tract\u2010binding protein (PTB) or eIF2Bg 44. Inhibition of the PTB alone by siRNAs resulted in an efficient decrease in the levels of HCV proteins as well as HCV RNA replication in Huh7 cells harboring the HCV replicon 45. In another study, siRNA against cellular RNA helicase p68 reduced HCV negative strand replication 46. The E7 protein of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) contributes to oncogenesis. E7 was found to specifically activate the transcription of the cellular transcription factor E2F2 in an in vitro system of differentiating human keratinocytes. While suppression of E2F2 levels through the use of siRNA decreased HPV replication, this loss did not affect cell proliferation. Thus, E2F2 is a potential target for antiviral therapies 47.",

In each case, the best strategy for viral inhibition needs to be assessed according to the virus type and its unique life cycle. Interestingly, a combination therapy of two siRNAs, targeting different viral sequences, each with inhibitory function, did not have an enhanced effect. This was also found by other groups, assessing the RNAi effect in other human and non\u2010human pathogens. These repeated observations could be related to the early saturation of the RNAi cellular machinery.

However, in most cases, the viral agent causing the acute severe endemic, possibly pandemic disease, could be rapidly identified and sequenced, as was the case during the recent outbreak of SARS. In these cases, the development of siRNAs targeted against various regions of the viral genome could lead to a quick development of a therapy against the acute viral infection. The production, delivery, dose, and modes of administration of siRNAs could be tailor\u2010designed for any group of targets. Suffice to say, it is imperative that the timetable for the generation of a new siRNA\u2010based RNA silencing drug could be shorter, so that a therapeutic platform against many specific infectious agents with pandemic potential could be forthcoming. Obviously, it must be remembered that additional important factors need to be implemented for the development of an antiviral drug, such as in vitro and in vivo models, although these requirements are essential for any other type of therapeutic modality to be produced and tested. One recent report nicely exemplified the fact that synthetic siRNA could be generated against a single (respiratory syncytial virus, RSV) or a double infection (with parainfluenza virus, PIV), and rapidly tested in vitro, as a sufficiently predictive tool for an in vivo effect 65. In this report, the siRNAs against both RSV and PIV were administered nasally with profound antiviral preventive and therapeutic effects without inducing interferon production. As mentioned in previous sections, siRNA is very effective against other life\u2010threatening pandemic threats such as influenza infections 66. However, it must be remembered that we are probably just at the beginning of experimental assessments to determine the potential antiviral effects of siRNA.",

In addition, this same group also showed that the antisense siRNA strand is critical for the RNAi effect and that single nucleotide mutations at the central or 5\u2032 regions are detrimental for the antiviral effect. siRNA was also effective against SARS caused by the newly discovered coronavirus in a preventive model in vitro\n68. Currently, since there is no available effective specific therapy against SARS, RNAi could be developed for this serious infection. In other cases of severe human infections by viral pathogens, there are fewer promising results than for the antiviral potential against viral replication by inducing RNAi. siRNA was also assessed against WNV infection. In one report, while the investigators failed to show an antiviral effect in active replicating cells 69, they showed prevention of infection in a previous report. Another group assessed the potential effect of siRNA against WNV infection in vivo. Again, only a preventive mode of therapy was found partially effective against viral replication and disease outcome in mice 70. From the reports on the use of siRNA against human viral pathogens causing acute disease, we could learn that for each specific pathogen infecting a specific cell lineage or tissue, we would probably need to perform an in\u2010depth assessment, with proper in vitro and in vivo models, and develop specific delivery systems. Although the road towards RNAi development could be visible for some of its destinations and the traveling speed could be changing, the target time remains unknown and unpredictable. An interesting new approach of preventing viral infection was reported by the group of Judy Lieberman 71. In an effort to suggest a method of prevention of HSV2 sexual transmission, intravaginal installation of siRNAs targeting two HSV\u20102 genes protected mice from a lethal HSV\u20102 challenge without inducing interferon\u2010responsive genes. This encouraging result once again proves that combining a realistic method of gene delivery with a specific genetic drug payload for a specific disease could result in a beneficial gene therapy outcome.",

Characterizing the specific viral pathogen, even in a pandemic situation, could enhance the rational design of a sequence\u2010specific siRNA that can be used as therapy.

This also applies when designing an RNAi approach for HCV infection, as well as for other chronic viral infections. The studies assessing the effect of RNAi against HCV were mostly restricted to in vitro replicon systems, as discussed above. Alternative in vivo systems were also adopted by some investigators, with reporting proteins used to assess the antiviral effect 80. In early studies using the in vitro HCV replicon system, it was shown that a synthetic siRNA targeting the 5\u2032 core region of HCV inhibited viral proteins and significantly suppressed viral replication for at least 8 days 21. At about the same time, a different group showed, also in the replicon system, that siRNA against the NS5B region (viral polymerase) is most effective in suppressing HCV replication 19. This group had also transfected the HuH7 replicon cells with a vector expressing complementary strands of siRNA, again targeting the NS5B region, under the control of two separate H1 promoters (pCEP4, Invitrogen). In this case, the suppression effect on HCV replication lasted over 3 weeks. Another group targeted similar HCV regions, NS3 and NS5B 26; they introduced shRNAs targeted against these two genes into Huh7\u2010replicon cells. The delivery systems that were used in their study were plasmids or lentiviral vectors harboring shRNAs against NS3 or NS5B, expressed from the U6 promoter. In both cases, they observed similar effects, i.e., suppression of HCV proteins and viral replication. However, shRNA against the 5\u2032\u2010UTR of HCV resulted in very low levels of inhibition of HCV replication.",

Targeting these viral replication/gene expression cofactors is a potential target for inhibition of viral replication. However, this approach should always be balanced against the potential of generating side effects which could overshadow the beneficial antiviral outcome. A recent study assessed this approach in vitro, targeting two HCV replication cofactors: proteasome \u03b1\u2010subunit 7 and Hu antigen R. shRNA targeted against these two genes that were expressed from an expression vector transfected into HuH7 HCV replicon cells showed a modest reduction of HCV transcription 81. However, this modest inhibition on the one hand, and the potential role of both proteins in normal cellular function on the other, might suggest that it is advisable to abstain from such approaches, if possible. An interesting study in vivo targeting the HCV IRES, translating a luciferase reporter protein, revealed that the in vitro synthesized shRNA, administered systemically by the hydrodynamic method, encountered a sustained antiviral effect lasting over 4 days compared to synthetic siRNA 80.",

Although the results of these studies suggest that HIV could be targeted by RNAi, there are major obstacles in translating this therapeutic approach into the clinical setting. Most reports have used sequences from laboratory HIV strains. Viruses with mutations at the RNAi recognition site produced an escape mutant after a long\u2010term RNAi pressure. Targeting relatively conserved HIV sequences could improve the efficacy of the RNAi effect. A recent study looked at the protective effect of shRNAs targeting the rev, gag, and vif sequences of a panel of HIV clades 82. This study showed that targeting the vif HIV region had a significant inhibition effect on HIV replication. However, the long\u2010term use of any specific siRNA or shRNA against HIV could probably induce the generation of escape mutants containing nucleotide substitutions at or near the target sites. Furthermore, the escape from RNAi\u2010mediated inhibition could also signify the emergence of mutations that change the HIV RNA secondary structures 83. All of these data emphasize the significance of HIV evolution during RNAi pressure and its potential impact on the use of RNAi against HIV. The virus also harbors a specific mechanism that evades the nucleic\u2010acid\u2010based innate immunity of human cells against HIV. The genome of HIV contains a plethora of dsRNA regions capable of being processed into siRNAs targeting the viral genome to suppression 84. However, the virus has evolved by a counter process, rendering itself resistant to RNAi through the Tat protein, altering the Dicer effect on viral sequences, and abrogating the host cell innate immunity against HIV infection. Interestingly, on the other hand, it is possible that HIV does apply the cellular RNAi machinery for regulation of its own gene expression. The HIV nef region encodes a microRNA, miR\u2010N367, which can block nef expression 85. Later, it was shown by the same group that miR\u2010N367 targets the HIV LTR promoter region, downregulating viral transcription; this might be a mechanism by which the virus regulates its own transcription 86.",

One option of overcoming this major obstacle is to generate therapeutics against highly conserved viral genomic regions. A recent report showed that it is possible to clone shRNAs against the conserved regions of the HIV genome into HIV vectors, and to suppress HIV infection upon targeting the gag, pol, int and vpu sequences 87. However, although this approach could be applied for prevention of infection, cessation of an ongoing HIV replication is prone to failure due to the high mutation rate of the virus. An alternative strategy could be to target essential cellular determinants for HIV infection. The early step of HIV infection would be attaching to the viral cellular receptor. During the progressive stage of the disease, most HIV isolates use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 for viral attachment and penetration into the host cells. Patients with mutations of the CXCR4 receptor are less prone to HIV infection and are healthy by any significant measure. This finding was the rationale used to develop an anti\u2010HIV approach by targeting CXCR4 expression and inhibiting viral fusion with the cellular membrane 54. It is expected that such an approach will pose a major obstacle to viral evolution and prevent infection. Other groups have also adopted this strategy to render cells resistant to HIV infection 52, 53, 58, 59, 60. The HIV regulatory protein, rev, is essential for viral life cycle in a number of ways including splicing, translation and trans\u2010activation. With regard to rev trans\u2010activation properties, it needs to interact with the hypusine\u2010containing protein eIF\u20105A. The eIF\u20105A rev cofactor is activated following a catalytic step performed by the human deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS). A recent study has suggested that RNA interference inhibiting DHS blocked HIV replication 88. Again, as with other drugs in development against HIV infection, we are confronted with the following major questions: what are the potential side effects from such an approach, and what would be the therapeutic dose window? Indeed, studies aimed at unfolding these issues are crucial before entering any clinical studies. Other groups have also suggested the targeting of other cellular factors essential for the HIV life cycle, including PARP\u20101 55, the elongation transcription factor P\u2010TEFb 56, cyclophilin A, DC\u2010SIGN 61, 63, the human elongation transcription factor SPT5 64, and human cyclin T1 89. The road towards the development of an efficient therapeutic modality using the anti\u2010HIV RNA interference strategy is bumpy, due to potential side effects; moreover, significant strides will have to be made towards harnessing clearcut approaches as described, as well as designing additional rational studies through wet and dry investigations 89.",

Many plant DNA and RNA viruses have developed proteins that function as suppressors of RNA silencing 94, 95, 96, 97, 98. Since the silencing suppression reduces the antiviral effects, the viruses can accumulate in their target cells and reach higher titers. Comparing those suppressor genes did not reveal any sequence homology between them. The RNA silencing suppressors can act upon the various sequences of the RNAi machinery in several ways such as inhibition of siRNA processing, inhibition of the incorporation step into the RISC, or preventing the action of its effector molecules. Although the mechanisms of inhibition of silencing are not fully understood, there are several suppressor genes that their targets have identified. The p19 protein from the tombusvirus was shown to bind specifically to the siRNAs, and thus may inhibit the incorporation step of the siRNAs into the silencing effector complexes 98. The HC\u2010Pro protein, expressed by polyviruses, acts by targeting the RISC 99, 100. Another example is the mosaic virus 2b protein (Cmv2b). This nucleus\u2010localized RNAi suppressor protein inhibits the activity of the spreading signal of the RNAi, and inhibits DNA methylation processes in the nucleus that control the silencing pathways 97, 101.

It has been shown that in Drosophila and mosquito cultured cells, the FHV\u2010encoded protein, B2, inhibited RNA silencing, but the mechanism is still unknown. This protein also inhibited RNAi in transgenic plants, suggesting that the RNA silencing pathway is conserved in plants and animals 92, 102, 103.

Both the influenza virus NS1 protein and the vaccinia virus E3L protein can inhibit RNAi in Drosophila S2 cultured cells 102. The adenovirus encoded inhibitor of RNAi is functional in mammalian cells. The human adenovirus inhibits RNAi in the later stages of infection by suppressing the activity of Dicer and the RISC. The virus\u2010associated RNAs, VA RNAI and VA RNAII, bind directly to Dicer and function as competitive substrates, squelching it, and the resulting siRNAs are incorporated into the active RISC 104, 105.

This is most apparent in cases where the fidelity of the viral polymerase is low, especially in viruses with an RNA genome. To overcome this hurdle, most antiviral therapeutic protocols harness a strategy that uses multiple drugs targeting different viral proteins or steps in its life cycle. One example where such resistance has been developed in vitro is in the case of RNAi against the Nef gene of HIV 106, 107. To overcome this problem, it may be advisable to utilize a multi\u2010targeted RNAi approach possibly in combination with additional antiviral modalities. Although targeting multiple genomic sites has probably no advantage with regard to the direct antiviral effect, it could repress the development of resistance. The initial steps towards focusing into this avenue have already been established. The group that initially described the siRNA effect in vitro in the replicon system against HCV 19 have shown that, following several rounds of treatment with the same siRNA against HCV, the replicon became resistant to that specific siRNA, developing a point mutation at the target site. However, the replicon was still sensitive to a siRNA targeting a different HCV region. In addition, the development of a resistant replicon was limited by the use of a combination of two siRNAs targeting simultaneously different HCV genomic regions 108. A similar approach has also been suggested by other groups 109.",

This effect is mediated by dsRNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (PKR) 111. While we expect that this issue will foster additional debates, at this point, it would be important to impart cautious interpretations upon describing RNAi effects. In addition, recent studies have suggested that although siRNA does not activate the intracellular interferon machinery in mammalian cells upon entrance or in situ propagation inside the cells, if they are shorter than 30\u2010nt dsRNA, there is a non\u2010specific innate immune response depicted by cytokine production 112. Furthermore, this effect is dependent on the Toll\u2010like receptor 3 (TLR3) that senses dsRNA and serves as its receptor. TLR3 is located intracellularly on the endosome membrane and signals through NF\u03baB nuclear translocation for the production of inflammatory cytokines. Incubation of immune cells with siRNA induces the activation of cells 113. All of these effects could be dependent on the concentration of siRNA. Recent works identified putative immunostimulatory motifs within siRNAs, and showed that even a slight change of these motifs did not significantly hamper the RNAi process 114.

Upon coinjecting siRNA and its target being expressed from a plasmid vector, we could achieve knockdown of expression in the liver following a hydrodynamic injection. In our laboratory, we could show that HBV expression out of an HBV head\u2010to\u2010tail plasmid that supports viral replication in the liver of mice could effectively be silenced transiently with synthetic siRNA 72. This effect was dose\u2010dependent. However, the kinetics of this effect revealed that the silencing was transient as was also shown by other groups using a similar approach 27, 123, 124, 125. The effect subsides after 48 to 72 h and is probably completely lost after 7 days. The silencing effect of siRNA following systemic administration of duplex RNA could have been hampered by various factors, thus imposing some logistic hurdles upon translating this approach into the clinical setting (additional examples of RNAi against viral infections are depicted in Table 1). Although duplex RNA is quite stable in serum 124, and more stable than ssDNA or ssRNA, a high serum concentration could reduce stability. The introduction of phosphorothioate linkages could enhance stability in the serum 124. Others have used chemically modified siRNA with the complete absence of 2\u2032\u2010OH residues on the sense and antisense strands of the dsRNA, including 2\u2032\u2010fluoro, 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl and 2\u2032\u2010deoxy sugars. These chemical modifications of siRNA were produced in order to enhance its stability and effect 126. Not all modifications have resulted in beneficial silencing effects 127, 128, 129; a short review of these modifications was reported by Paroo and Corey 130. One particular interesting report 131 shows that a specific siRNA with a combined chemical modification had a significant and a relatively sustained effect in vitro and in vivo as compared to non\u2010modified siRNA. However, although siRNA is relatively stable in the serum, there are disadvantages of using synthetic siRNA: (1) The effect of synthetic siRNA is transient; in order to impose a long\u2010term effect, repeated administrations would be needed, and this might still be true for the chemically modified siRNAs. (2) The production of synthetic siRNA is expensive, making repeated administrations for long\u2010term effect very costly. (3) It is very complicated to target synthetic siRNA to a specific cell or tissue. However, in specific cases, the use of siRNA directly administered into the target tissue could encounter a significant effect. In a recent report by Dorn et al., they used siRNA against the pain\u2010related cation\u2010channel P2X3, by intrathecal injection of phosphorothioated (PS) siRNA in a rat model of neuropathic pain 132. Although they did not compare the non\u2010PS\u2010modified versus the PS\u2010modified siRNA, they have clearly shown a significant effect of siRNA in relieving chronic pain. Furthermore, the effect was superior to the comparable P2X3 antisense oligonucleotides. One specific case where such an approach could be translated into an applicable clinical therapeutic modality is in post\u2010herpetic neuralgia which could follow Varicella\u2013Zoster infection. However, since chronic pain is a condition that is generally expected to last for months, this type of treatment would need to be readministered several times. A recent report took advantage of the knowledge generated regarding the stabilization of siRNA by chemical modifications, and protection of the modified siRNA with pegylated liposomes upon delivery. They assessed the antiviral effect of siRNA against HBV in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the modified siRNA had induced less non\u2010specific cytokine secretion combined with an effective and anti\u2010HBV effect of up to 6 weeks after repeated weekly administrations 133.",

Tailoring the specific delivery tactic and method is essential when designing a specific therapeutic strategy. One example is the use of siRNA targeting the influenza virus genome. This malady can cause moderate to severe illness, can affect millions of people each year, and could be life\u2010threatening. For the gene therapist, this means that the genetic therapy effect could be designed for a short window of time. In this case, the use of synthetic siRNA with an enhanced transduction is an appropriate approach. In a study by Ge et al., the systemic and intratracheal delivery of polyethylenimine (PEI), a cationic polymer, promoting siRNA delivery in mice, is beneficial for prophylaxis and therapy of the influenza virus infection 134. PEI was developed for in vitro and in vivo local and systemic gene delivery and PEI\u2010mediated gene delivery/transduction into the lung following systemic and intratracheal administrations. Some investigators reported safety problems in specific cases upon the use of PEI in animals. However, plasmid DNA mixed with PEI administered into the human bladder was safe (A. Hochberg, personal communication). Tompkins et al., also assessed the effect of siRNA against the same pathogen, the influenza virus 135. This group used a different therapeutic regimen. They used a preventive measure by administering naked siRNA systemically, i.e., intravenously, before infection, and at the time of infection, they administered the siRNA/Oligofectamine\u2122 (a lipid carrier from Invitrogen) intranasally. In this model, the undertaken therapeutic approach prevented death of animals. However, this study was limited to asking the general question of siRNA effect against influenza virus infection rather than comparing different siRNA delivery systems. Thus, we cannot draw any conclusions that would suggest a preference for any specific delivery method in this disease model system. Future animal studies would be required to determine the preferred delivery method. In addition to the lipid carriers, traditionally developed for in vitro and in vivo delivery of DNA and now for siRNA, alternative approaches have also been developed. One specific interesting report by Minakuchi et al. describes the use of atelocollagen (AT) 136. AT is prepared from type I collagen from calf dermis. This is a low immunogenic product that is already available in clinics for various indications like promoting wound healing. The same investigators showed that AT enhanced DNA delivery and supported prolonged expression. AT mediated the delivery of siRNA in vitro and was found in vivo to encounter a significant advantage over the siRNA/liposome complex in inhibiting tumor growth in mice. Recently, more sophisticated delivery methods of siRNA have also been developed to treat brain tumors 137. The obtained results could be important for those interested in developing siRNA therapeutics for viral encephalitis. The model that they used in vivo to assess their delivery and RNAi effects was an immunodeficient mouse with an inoculated intracranial human U87 glioma tumor that was dependent on EGF signaling for growth. One of the major barriers for macromolecules to travel to diseased tissue in the brain is the blood\u2010brain barrier (BBB). Passing the BBB is a major challenge faced for the development of any pharmacological compound with high molecular weight. Pegylated (polyethylene glycol) immunoliposomes (85 nm size liposomes designed with monoclonal antibodies over its outer surface) were able to support transvascular delivery of plasmid DNA and to target and transduce specific cells in the brain. This group conjugated the PEGylated liposomes with two monoclonal antibodies, one against the mouse transferrin receptor to enable BBB crossing, and the second against the insulin receptor to enhance cellular uptake. The generated PEGylated immunoliposomes encapsidated a plasmid payload that was designed to express the siRNA against the EGF receptor in the transduced cell. The siRNA complex of PEGylated immunoliposomes showed an enhanced antitumor effect by prolonging survival of animals. The ability to treat brain tumors with a systemic approach rather than by stereotactic injection is a major achievement. Recently, it has been reported that recombinant HBV capsids can be used as efficient vehicles for oligonucleotide delivery; they can encapsulate the oligonucleotides in vitro, and mediate their delivery into cells very efficiently. The process is not cell\u2010type\u2010specific. This method may be useful for in vivo systems for HBV\u2010infected individuals or in other diseases provided that the immunogenicity of the viral capsids can be decreased; until then, it can be used in cell culture and in ex vivo systems 138.",

Each type of viral vector holds specific properties. These viral vector characteristics should be those that determine which viral delivery system needs to be applied for the specific therapeutic target. The adenovector 139, and in particular the Ad\u2010gutless vector, hold major promise for liver\u2010directed systemic delivery. In cases where short\u2010term silencing effect is warranted, the non\u2010gutless vector could then be applied; however, for prolonged silencing effects, the gutless vector might be more beneficial. In the gutless vector, there are practically no restrictions as to the size of the sequences to be incorporated and these could include marker genes, regulatory controlled cassettes or matrix\u2010controlled regions for prolonged expression. Controlling the expression of an siRNA, specifically in tumor cells, could also be designed in a conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd). CRAds are designed to replicate and specifically kill tumor cells without harming normal cells. Carette et al.\n140 applied CRAd, which is dependent on Rb deficiency for replication, to test its potential in silencing expression by shRNAs, a marker gene in vitro in tumor cells. They showed that the silencing effect of a marker gene is dependent on CRAd replication. The combination of the CRAd antitumor effect with a siRNA against a tumor\u2010dependent growth gene should be assessed in the future; this possibility was not considered by this group, whether in vitro or in vivo. These issues would need further studies in an effort to assess and enhance their therapeutic potential.",

The integration site could not be specifically targeted and this could cause side effects. Integration that occurs near cellular protooncogenes can lead to their aberrant expression from the viral LTR, or alternatively this could cause the disruption of a tumor suppresser gene expression. In the past 2 years, numerous groups have reported on various retroviral deliveries 141, including lentiviral systems to express siRNAs against viral pathogens and tumor cells. Ralf Bartenschlager and associates reported the use of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo\u2010MuLV)\u2010based vector (pBABE) as a delivery system for siRNA targeting HCV 22. In their publication, they also assessed a unique RNAi approach against HCV infection. This was done in an effort to overcome the low fidelity of the viral polymerase, establishing a state of quasispecies by generating endoribonuclease\u2010prepared siRNA to simultaneously target multiple sites of the viral genome in order to prevent escape. As for the retroviral delivery approach, this group designed their siRNA mainly against the viral IRES sequences. Their readout system to assess the silencing effect involved tissue culture cells transfected with the subgenomic HCV replicon. This replicon harbors the HCV IRES upstream of the luciferase gene and the neomycin resistance region, and an additional non\u2010HCV IRES upstream of the viral non\u2010structural sequences. The presence of the luciferase gene enables the determination of HCV IRES activity in vitro. This system enables the assessment of the effect of siRNA against the HCV IRES as well as against the viral non\u2010structural genome. The siRNA in the retrovirus was expressed from the H1 promoter. They designed numerous siRNAs in the vector and found that a specific region in the HCV IRES, near the beginning of the viral coding nucleotides, was the most sensitive to RNAi effect. Although this is an interesting approach with clearcut results, significant developmental steps and modifications are required in order to translate this modality into the clinical setting. However, the results described in this report again suggest that the RNAi encounters a therapeutic potential for chronic viral infection. Similar observations were reported by other groups ( 18, 24, see Table 1).",

However, it must be kept in mind that the clinical experience with this vector is very limited. Numerous papers were recently published describing differently designed lentiviral vectors to meet different needs of siRNA expression. These include systems which support the control 121 or conditioning 142, 143 of siRNA expression. Veerle Baekelandt and associates have designed a study to assess the potential use of lentiviruses in delivering siRNA into brain tissue. In their recent report 144, they constructed a lentiviral vector with siRNA against the marker gene eGFP. Upon simultaneous administration into the brain tissue by stereotactic injection of the lentivirus expressing the eGFP and the lentiviral vector expressing the siRNA against the same gene, they were able to show almost complete knockdown of eGFP expression. In two additional experiments in which the siRNA lentivirus was administered before or after the marker gene, they were also able to show significant silencing of expression. Interestingly, they claimed, albeit without showing the data, that this effect persisted for 6 months. However, the issue of delivery is again a major barrier. Stereotactic administrations are possible, but alternative approaches of systemic delivery or intra\u2010organ spreading of the vector would be beneficial. Lentiviruses hold major promise in gene therapy. Once the issue of integration and production is overcome, we expect that the lentiviral\u2010based vector will be integrated into the clinical setting.",

Beverly Davidson and associates reported an interesting study on the suppression of polyglutamine\u2010induced neurodegeneration in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1), a disease of the polyglutamine\u2010expansion group which also includes Huntington chorea 145. They expressed the siRNA under a modified CMV promoter due to its enhanced expression/silencing effect compared to the pol III promoter, in their hands. In addition, they revealed that incorporating the miR23 loop (10\u2010nt loop sequence) into the siRNA expression cassette enhanced the silencing effect, resulting in improved suppression of the ataxin protein levels 118. However, this effect was only apparent in the pol III expression vector. How to select the best loop in any specific case is still an open question, and, presently, this is a matter of empiric assessment. In their mouse model, they injected the AAV vector expressing the shRNA against the mutant SCA1 message directly into the brain tissue. This treatment showed long\u2010term therapeutic effect on motor coordination as well as a histological improvement by reducing intranuclear inclusions. Although this represents a step forward from previous studies with similar models that used antisense and ribozymes as therapeutic agents, we are still far from the clinic. The direct administration of a viral vector into brain tissue is a significant drawback for the current delivery systems. The potential side effects of AAV administration into the brain may soon be revealed once results of clinical studies using the AAV for direct brain administration in Parkinson and Alzheimer disease studies are available 146. One specific point of importance should be mentioned on the issue of designing loop sequences stated previously. A number of investigators have assessed this matter as related to the effectiveness of silencing. We must bear in mind that for each specific case, there is a need to develop a specific structure to improve the silencing effect 147.",

            "text": "The jury is still out as to when an antisense approach should be adopted against viral infections or when an si/shRNA strategy should be applied. Although antisense oligos were discovered more than 25 years ago 148 their role as antiviral tools in the clinic is still in progress. Early studies with antisense oligos have shown promising antiviral potency. However, later reports determined that such approaches encounter significant problems. Although comprehensive stringent comparison studies in vitro and in vivo between antisense oligos and siRNA were not performed, we would like to stress a few practical points which characterize each group of compounds, in particular those which are important for those investigators interested in designing an antiviral strategy. Antisense oligos with a high phosphorothioate content, which are early\u2010generation antisense, interact directly and non\u2010specifically with proteins, potentially interfering with their function 149. However, recently developed 2nd and 3rd generation RNAs\u2014like oligos\u2014have improved significantly the binding affinities of antisense oligos, as well as their nuclease and non\u2010specific protein\u2010binding characteristics. The new generations include 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl (2OM) and the additional version 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methoxyethyl (2OME), both encountering improved nuclease resistance, binding affinity and reduced non\u2010specific binding affinity. Recently, additional novel chemically modified versions of antisense oligos were developed including the locked nucleic acids (LNA) 150, anhydrohexitol nucleic acids (HNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), morpholino nucleic acids (MNAs), and other uncharged oligos. All these novel chemicals have been tested and proven to hold significant antisense properties, with antiviral effects in models in vitro and in vivo. Their effects are due to the high binding affinity and nuclease degradation resistance, without significant RNaseH activity. To overcome this hurdle, a chimeric version of oligos was generated, the gapmers, containing a core region of a phosphodiester/phosphorothioate flanked on both sides with modified oligo backbones. These gapmers also hold the RNaseH activity of traditional antisenses. When designing any specific experiment aimed to assess an antisense effect, it is important to select the best fitted oligo by testing 10 to 20 different sequences, and compare the selected oligo with appropriate controls containing scrambled, mismatched and irrelevant antisense oligos.",

            "text": "Although a significant amount of investigations would be needed to confirm which specific antiviral nucleic acid approaches would be best fitted for a specific disease therapy, by comparing antisense or ribozymes and siRNA, some general guidelines can be phrased: (1) For acute viral infections, the preferred type of RNA therapy could be a synthetic designed antisense or siRNA. (2) For chronic viral disease targets, a preferred treatment would be such that continuously generates an antiviral drug. This could include an expression vector for any type of nucleic\u2010acid\u2010based drug, including antisense, ribozyme or shRNA. (3) For diseases of simple accessible organs, such as ocular cavity, oral cavity, vagina and epidermis, synthetic RNA\u2010based drugs might be beneficial. The need for repeated administration might be simple even in chronic disease states in cases of accessible organs. (4) For chronic multi\u2010organ, or internal organ, involved in viral infections, e.g., chronic viral hepatitis B or C, intracellular continuous expression of high\u2010level non\u2010toxic, effective therapy is desirable. In this case, an expression system delivered into infected cells is warranted. Designed shRNA based on up\u2010to\u2010date criteria of shRNA 151, 152, 153 might be the preferred gene therapy based treatment. (5) Special attention must be given as to the specific type of virus to be targeted; whether a DNA or a RNA agent. Furthermore, it is important to know where, inside the cellular compartments, should the RNA\u2010based drug be concentrated, e.g., cytoplasmatic vs. nuclear. For RNA viruses, such as HCV, which replicate in the cytoplasm, an antisense approach could be suggested, although it should be kept in mind that the RNaseH effect is preferentially restricted to the nuclear compartment of the cell. However, for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, in which there is a nuclear reservoir of the virus in the form of super\u2010coiled species, a vector which will express its shRNA payload in the nuclear compartment is preferred. Numerous new expression systems were recently suggested to encounter improved silencing properties 147.
