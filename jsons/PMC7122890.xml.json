While the distinctions between microevolution and macroevolution have been topics of lively debate within the history and philosophy of science (HPS) communities for some time, relatively new to the field of science education is the conceptualization of macroevolution as a distinct concept in need of targeted instructional emphasis and research (Catley 2006).",

            "text": "The term macroevolution is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon of evolution, first coined (in German) by Filipchenko in 1927 and subsequently recruited into the English language in 1937 by the prominent biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky (Burian 1988). Since its introduction, the meaning of the term macroevolution, like many other biological terms, has changed substantially (see Erwin 2010). Despite these changes, nearly all definitions consider the formation of new species to be an important partition dividing micro- from macroevolution. The US National Academy of Sciences (NAS 2012), for example, defines macroevolution as \u201c[l]arge-scale evolution occurring over geologic time that results in the formation of new species and broader taxonomic groups\u201d and microevolution as \u201c[c]hanges in the traits of a group of organisms within a species that do not result in a new species.\u201d Importantly, the NAS definitions\u2014and related distinctions in the science education literature (e.g., Catley 2006; Nadelson and Southerland 2010a, b)\u2014focus primarily on scale (e.g., within vs. between species; human timescales vs. geological timescales) and pattern (e.g., descriptions of large-scale change as opposed to causes of such change). In a similar vein, Catley (2006) highlights the distinction between short-term (microevolutionary) and long-term (macroevolutionary) change (see also Nadelson and Southerland 2010a, b). While discussions of micro- and macroevolution in the HPS and evolutionary biology literature also focus on scale and pattern, they have paid particular attention to putative factors that explain large-scale evolutionary events at different scales of analysis. While natural selection (and other microevolutionary processes) are universally acknowledged as contributors to evolutionary change by biologists, the expansion of possible mechanisms accounting for large-scale patterns in the history of life is considered a major advance in evolutionary theory (e.g., Gould 2002). These important distinctions between pattern and mechanism deserve attention, as they have led to a conceptual divergence between the science education and HPS literature.",

Nonetheless, it is important to point out that many macroevolutionary patterns are well established and uncontroversial, such as the reality of mass extinctions (e.g., Jablonski 1986), the originations of now-extinct higher taxa (e.g., Erwin 2010), the evolutionary relationships among all living things (e.g., Hillis 2010), long-term trends in the fossil record (Gould 2002), and evolutionary stasis (e.g., Nehm and Budd 2008). A core macroevolutionary topic of importance to HPS scholars and science educators relates to putative distinctions between large-scale observable patterns in the history of life on the one hand and inferences and theories about the mechanisms responsible for these patterns on the other.",

Evolutionary biologists from diverse disciplinary backgrounds (e.g., Dobzhansky, Simpson, Mayr, Eldredge, Gould, Gingerich, Futuyma, and Orr) have, like most scientists, recognized that large-scale evolutionary trends, extinctions, and originations of higher taxa do in fact appear in the fossil record (e.g., Simpson 1953; Futuyma 2005; Coyne and Orr 1998; Erwin 2010). But these and many other authors have disagreed about whether microevolutionary processes (such as natural selection and genetic drift) are capable of sufficiently accounting for such well-established large-scale patterns (Gould 1985). Causal pluralism, or the expansion of explanatory mechanisms beyond natural selection, is thus a key topic of attention in HPS perspectives on macroevolution. Such plurality is also historically important, as it is considered by some to be divergent from the views of Darwin (1859), who proposed \u201c\u2026natural selection as the single unifying mechanism that causes both micro- and macroevolution\u201d (Travis and Reznick 2009, p. 126).",

Biologists such as Dobzhansky, Simpson, and Futuyma, in contrast, have generally considered natural selection to be a sufficient causal explanation for most macroevolutionary patterns (for a discussion of Simpson\u2019s changing views on this matter, see Sepkoski 2008). The views of these scholars are aligned in some respects with those of Travis and Reznick (2009, p. 128), who note: \u201cIn the final analysis there is nothing in the fossil record that inherently contradicts Darwin\u2019s daring idea that natural selection is the unifying mechanism.\u201d In sum, the reality of macroevolutionary patterns is simply not in doubt.1 The controversy in macroevolutionary biology relates to questions about the processes involved (natural selection alone or natural selection + other mechanisms).",

In an exhaustive review of the literature, Coyne and Orr summarize a wealth of work indicating that natural selection plays a major role in speciation and that \u201c[i]t is uncontroversial that most phenotypic divergence in ecologically important traits is driven by natural selection\u201d (p. 385).

The important point to keep in mind is that these four concepts, in concert with (or in opposition to) natural selection, could account for large-scale evolutionary outcomes that were unexpected or unexplainable by the exclusive extrapolation of microevolutionary processes over geological timescales. By expanding the range of causal factors contributing to evolutionary change, evolutionary biologists could potentially improve causal precision and eliminate troublesome empirical anomalies. Questions about the validity of these macroevolutionary processes have generated a rich literature in HPS and evolutionary biology.

Geographic range has long been considered a species-level, variable, and heritable trait (Jablonski and Hunt 2006). Philosophers and paleobiologists have debated these empirical cases at length and agree to some extent that species-level selection is theoretically possible (Hull 1980; Sepkoski 2008).

Mass extinctions are important in macroevolutionary thought because they have been thought to cause conceptual complications for extrapolationist accountings of macroevolutionary patterns (e.g., Raup 1994). Mass extinctions have the potential to counteract the smaller scale workings of natural selection; reproductive success and differential survival during \u201cnormal\u201d times may have little association with reproductive success and differential survival during times of mass extinction (Jablonski 1986). For example, while patterns of differential survival over millions of years may produce well-adapted animals of large body size, during geologically brief episodes of mass extinction (e.g., the end Cretaceous event), differential survival may favor animals of small body size thereby counteracting this adaptive trend. Mass extinctions therefore raise the possibility that microevolutionary processes alone cannot sufficiently account for large-scale patterns in the history of life (Erwin 2010). The (potentially stochastic) pruning of lineages during mass extinctions may \u201creset\u201d the playing field for lineages, counteracting the effects of adaptive microevolution. As noted by Raup (1994, p. 6758): \u201cExcept for a few cases, there is little evidence that extinction is selective in the [\u2026] sense argued by Darwin.\u201d In this view, natural selection cannot sufficiently account for macroevolutionary patterns; mass extinction must be considered as an additional causal factor that can work in opposition to natural selection.",

            "text": "A third macroevolutionary topic in the HPS literature is constraint and evolvability (Gould 2002; Erwin 2010; Minelli and Fusco 2012). While linking constraint and evolvability is questionable in some respects, both acknowledge the important roles that genetic, architectural, historical, developmental, and functional constraints may play in limiting the types of long-term evolutionary change that can occur (cf. Gould 2002, p. 1059; Erwin 2010). Gould sees particular patterns of macroevolutionary repetition (i.e., parallelism) as evidence of the importance of internal constraints. These constraints are significant in a macroevolutionary sense because they may \u201cpush back\u201d against the actions of natural selection and thereby limit pathways of evolutionary change. Put another way, limits on variation (caused by internal constraints) channel pathways of evolutionary change by limiting the options that selection has available to work with. Gould (2002) argues that this perspective is important relative to macroevolutionary theory because constraint helps to explain macroevolutionary patterns that cannot be accounted for by selection alone (see also Bateson and Gluckman 2011 for a more recent discussion). Such views also resonate with many perspectives from evolutionary developmental biology (e.g., Sansom and Brandon 2007; Love 2007, 2013).",

He challenges the notion that random genetic variation can (or does) generate an infinite variety of options for natural selection to work with, and so natural selection is not the only factor explaining discrete (vs. continuous) distributions of morphology in time and space. Evidence for this perspective may be found in David Raup\u2019s \u201cmorphospace\u201d diagrams (see Raup and Stanley 1978). These diagrams map the morphologies of extinct and extant species within the universe of forms that could theoretically exist. Comparing actual vs. possible shell shapes, for example, illustrates that some regions of morphospace are densely populated, whereas others are sparse. Desolate regions of morphospace are fertile ground for exploring the question of whether such forms are impossible to generate or merely have yet to evolve.",

As noted by Raff (2000, p. 74) \u201cevolutionary change occurs not by the direct transformation of adult ancestors into adult descendants but rather when developmental processes produce the features of each generation in an evolving lineage.\u201d Although for centuries naturalists have seriously considered the significance of this point (e.g., von Baer 1828; Darwin 1860\n3; Haeckel 1868; Goldschmidt 1940; Simpson 1944; Schindewolf 1950; Waddington 1970), the role that development has played in macroevolutionary thought has varied dramatically through history (see Gould 1977 for a review). Mayr (1988) argued that development was largely excluded from the \u201cevolutionary synthesis\u201d of the 1940s (see Futuyma 1998 for an alternative view) and subsequently remained somewhat isolated from evolutionary theory (at least in the United States; see Lloyd and Gould\u2019s (1993) preface to Schindewolf (1950/1993) for a more global perspective). This situation changed with Gould\u2019s forceful reintroduction of the importance of development to macroevolution in Ontogeny and Phylogeny (1977). Therein Gould reframed the complex historical literature on evolution and development, crafted a new (largely morphological) framework for heterochrony and heterotopy,4 and paved the way for the modern resurgence of interest in evo-devo that has yet to peak5 (Carroll 2005a, b).",

The revolutionary advances in regulatory genetics and genomics has transformed modern evo-devo into a mechanistic science (Carroll 2005a, b).

Catley emphasized that \u201c[w]ithout a clear perspective on macroevolution, an understanding of the full spectrum of evolution is simply not possible. This notwithstanding, microevolutionary mechanisms are taught almost exclusively in our schools, to the detriment of those mechanisms that allow us to understand the larger picture\u201d (Catley 2006, p. 768). In perhaps his most controversial claim, Catley states: \u201cKnowledge of natural selection, while vitally important, explains little about the incredible diversity of species on the planet\u201d (2006, p. 775). Hence, Catley appears to take a stance that is more closely aligned with what we have termed causal pluralism (see above)\u2014that there is more to the evolution of life than natural selection alone.

Cladograms are representational diagrams illustrating the evolutionary relationships of biological units (e.g., species and clades) generated using the underlying methodology of Willi Hennig (i.e., Cladistics; see Hennig 1999). They depict evolutionary patterns (characters and their various states across operational taxonomic units, such as species, groups partitioned based upon their recent common ancestry, and outgroups to polarize character state transformations). Cladograms are powerful tools for testing causal hypotheses (such as the \u201crandomness\u201d of mass extinctions), but themselves represent patterns of evolutionary relationship. Therefore, they are tools for articulating patterns in the natural world (the differential birth and death of species within and among clades) with tests of theory (e.g., selection of species in these clades). Macroevolutionary theory and its causal foundations are not necessarily addressed by using or teaching about cladograms (except, perhaps, patterns of cladogenesis), however central they may be to scientific practice. While cladograms have been increasingly employed in evolution research, it is important to point out that the major theoretical advances in macroevolution predated the widespread adoption of phylogenetic taxonomy in the United States (Hull 1988). In sum, while cladograms are now central tools in evolutionary biology, as noted by Catley, by themselves they do not say much about macroevolutionary processes and mechanisms, but only represent patterns.",

To do so, a curriculum must be redeveloped at both K-12 and college levels, so that preparation in macroevolution is a required part of K-12 biology preparation.\u201d He also takes aim at his scientific colleagues: \u201c\u2026few evolutionary biologists have a first-hand understanding of macroevolution, and they do not spend substantial time on it in their college courses.

Is Catley correct when he claims that \u201cAs currently taught, natural selection stops short of fostering an understanding of its effects over time on species themselves, or on cladogenesis. It concentrates almost exclusively on processes that occur within individuals and populations\u201d (Catley 2006, p. 775)? Have aspects of macroevolution in fact been covered in secondary and undergraduate textbooks and curricula? While it is challenging enough today to determine the degree to which particular topics are emphasized in science classrooms, the problem becomes much more difficult to address in the history of science education. One long-standing approach for documenting topical emphasis in the history of science education is to examine textbook content and structure (Cretzinger 1941; Skoog 1969; Moody 1996; Nehm et al. 2009). A surprising number of studies have investigated how evolutionary biology has been conceptualized and represented in textbooks over the past century (for a historical review, see Skoog 1969 and Moody 1996). These studies provide one empirical approach for attempting to answer the relatively straightforward question \u201cIs macroevolution being taught?\u201d Given that Catley\u2019s claim is directed at US education, our review is restricted to that context.8\n",

Moreover, it is clear that the term \u201cmacroevolution\u201d is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon of evolution, and many texts do not explicitly use this term even if they discuss ideas that are widely considered to be macroevolutionary in nature (e.g., horse evolution). In some of the earliest biology textbooks produced in the United States (from the period of 1900 to 1919), large-scale evolution (between-species change, or transformation) was \u201c\u2026a common topic as it was discussed in five of the eight textbooks\u201d [sampled] (Skoog 1969, p. 151). Other topics present in this early period included \u201cconvergent evolution,\u201d \u201cevolutionary relationships,\u201d \u201cfossils and other remains,\u201d and the \u201cevolution of birds\u201d (Skoog 1969). Species transformation again appears as one of the more common topics in textbooks from 1920 to 1929, with the evolution of horses being a particularly common macroevolutionary example9 (Skoog 1969). Similar patterns were noted through the 1960s (when natural selection was noted to occur in all of Skoog\u2019s textbook samples; see Fig. 14.1). In a similarly detailed analysis of 17 evolutionary subtopics in early textbooks, Nicholas (1965) found that paleontological evidence from the fossil record was the most commonly covered evolutionary subtopic. Other frequently included topics that could reasonably be considered to have a macroevolutionary slant were \u201crates of evolution,\u201d \u201cinfluence of the physical history of the Earth on evolution,\u201d and the \u201cevolutionary history of man [sic].\u201d This work is in alignment with Skoog\u2019s general findings.\n\n",

If the evolutionary history of particular clades is also considered, macroevolution is well represented, albeit segregated to particular chapters (Nehm et al. 2009). Importantly, however, macroevolution is more than tallying long-term patterns of life\u2019s \u201ccomings and goings\u201d (Padian 2010); macroevolutionary processes are indeed underrepresented in these undergraduate textbooks. In high school textbooks, coverage of macroevolution is difficult to ascertain given that ostensibly macroevolutionary topics, such as punctuated equilibrium, have been lumped with other topics in some empirical studies (e.g., Rosenthal 1985). Nevertheless, it is apparent that many topics that fit under the conceptual umbrella of macroevolution were covered in more recently published textbooks (Skoog 1984; Rosenthal 1985). Given that textbooks \u201c\u2026have much influence on what is taught\u201d (Skoog 1984, p. 127), this finding lends credence to the idea that macroevolution has had a consistent home in biology curricula for a century or more. Nonetheless, it may be true that the proportion of macroevolutionary content is too small (Padian 2010).",

Overall, there is remarkable similarity between concepts in the Standards and the macroevolutionary concepts that Catley (2006) and Padian (2010) suggest are lacking in emphasis.

But on review of the evolutionary topics covered in ABT, it is clear that specific macroevolutionary focus is comparatively less than treatments of natural selection and genetic drift. Perhaps the most interesting observation in reviewing the literature is that discussions of causal factors relating to macroevolution are extremely rare. So, in many respects, Catley (2006) is correct that macroevolution (at least as HPS scholars\u2019 conceptualize the topic, cf. Sepkoski 2008) has received short shrift in science education.

Interpreting cladograms, and using them to reason about evolution (micro- or macroevolution), involves aspects of visual reasoning, hierarchical thinking, abstract representation, misconceptions about evolution, and the nature of science (e.g., cladograms represent testable hypotheses). Given that cladograms have become de rigueur for testing patterns and processes of micro- and macroevolutionary change (e.g., pinpointing likely hosts of the SARS coronavirus, HIV subtype evolution, and the coevolution of angiosperms and their pollinators), this research direction is critically important for the field of science education. What have been lacking in this research program are discussions of the causal processes that many HPS scholars consider to be uniquely macroevolutionary, such as species selection, mass extinction selectivity, and clade/group selection (Sepkoski 2008). For some HPS scholars and evolutionary biologists, these ideas form the core of macroevolutionary theory and the most significant conceptual advances since Darwin (Gould 1981, 2002). Yet, it is precisely these concepts that remain conspicuously absent from the science education research literature about macroevolution.",

A broad array of empirical research questions in evolution education requires the use of measurement instruments designed to capture latent constructs, such as students\u2019 knowledge of macroevolution or their belief in evolution. In recent years, some science educators have raised concerns about the quality of extant instruments used in science education research in general and evolution education in particular (Nehm 2006; Smith 2010; Neumann et al. 2011). It is critically important that the evolution education research community develops and deploys high-quality instruments that are in alignment with professional measurement standards (i.e., AERA et al. 1999). Otherwise, the measures derived from such instruments will have little meaning, or, more problematically, they may mislead educators in their efforts to improve the teaching and learning of core scientific topics such as evolution. Instruments about macroevolution are no exception.",

First, school and university students (and the general public) appear to have different levels of acceptance relating to microevolutionary and macroevolutionary change. Second, many science curricula and textbooks distinguish microevolution and macroevolution as distinct instructional topics (e.g., Stanley 1980). Third, understanding microevolutionary processes (i.e., natural selection and genetic drift) may not translate into an understanding of, for example, larger scale phenomena, such as the formation of new species or evolutionary trends (Catley 2006). Fourth, Nadelson and Southerland (2010a, b) argue that natural selection and adaptation are primarily microevolutionary, and not macroevolutionary, concepts (contrary to the views of some, see above and Table 14.1). Thus, despite several microevolutionary knowledge measures (e.g., Settlage and Odom 1995), a distinct measure of macroevolutionary knowledge appeared to be justified. Given the controversies in the HPS literature about how macroevolution should be conceptualized, to what extent does Nadelson and Southerland\u2019s (2010a, b) construct of \u201cmacroevolution\u201d align with HPS perspectives?\n",

Our review has revealed several issues that would benefit from a more integrated approach. These include (1) recognizing that natural selection is widely acknowledged to be a major causal process in the generation of macroevolutionary patterns (particularly speciation), that is, constructs of macroevolution should not exclude the theory of natural selection (contra Nadelson and Southerland 2010a, b); (2) emphasizing macroevolutionary processes, such as species selection, mass extinction, constraint/evolvability, and evo-devo as core macroevolutionary topics (Table 14.1); (3) developing a consensus definition of macroevolution, associated key standards (i.e., phenomena and processes), and disciplinary practices (i.e., ways of thinking and reasoning, sensu Love 2013) that are appropriate for K-12 students; (4) performing studies of students\u2019 knowledge of macroevolutionary phenomena and their reasoning about the processes that might account for those phenomena; (5) linking Catley and colleagues\u2019 innovative work on cladogram interpretation with causal hypothesis testing. Such work has great potential in integrating a large body of work on microevolution and natural selection with macroevolutionary patterns and causes; (6) exploring how complex system thinking and hierarchical thinking relate to the transfer of natural selection understanding to broader temporal scales; such work is wanting but would add a new dimension to a growing body of work on complex systems (e.g., Wilensky and Resnick 1999). Overall, as envisioned by science educators, macroevolution is a messy amalgamation of phenomena, concepts, and processes united by a weak conceptual framework (e.g., vague notions of \u201cscale\u201d). Currently, the inconsistencies between how the HPS and science education communities envision macroevolution are dramatic, and as a consequence a shared vision of macroevolution is lacking.",

Nevertheless, as our chapter has illustrated, many studies in evolution education have not fully engaged with HPS scholarship, particularly the topics of species selection, mass extinction, constraint/evolvability, and evo-devo. Currently, science educators\u2019 conceptualization of \u201cmacroevolution\u201d consists of a messy amalgamation of phenomena, concepts, and processes united by a weak conceptual framework (e.g., vague notions of \u201cscale\u201d). Inconsistencies between how the HPS and science education communities envision macroevolution are dramatic and prevent meaningful progress in the teaching and learning of this important area of evolution.",

Sepkoski may have provided one of the more reasonable answers to this thorny question when he wrote: \u201cThere is no reason to fear teaching schoolchildren that drift, mutation, and natural selection form the central pillar of evolutionary theory, any more than it is dangerous to teach Newtonian mechanics in high-school physics classes. Like quantum mechanics, the current complex debates in macroevolutionary theory are appropriately taught after the basic framework has been established, since they build on, but not invalidate, the foundation\u201d (2008, p. 234). As our review has demonstrated, contemporary views of macroevolution in the HPS community encompass much more than pattern recognition and cladogram interpretation, do not discount the role of natural selection, and offer a more expansive perspective on the range of causal processes that may be responsible for the grand history of life on earth.",
