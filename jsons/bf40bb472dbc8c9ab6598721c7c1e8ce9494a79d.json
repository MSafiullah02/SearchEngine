This surgical procedure was fi rst described by George Crile in 1906 although reports of similar procedures of en bloc resections go back to 1888 when Franciszek Jawdynski -a Polish surgeon -reported four cases. The work of Crile was further popularized by several surgeons including the famous American surgeon, Hayes Martin. However, the morbidity accompanying the radical approach of the original procedure stimulated the development of a more conservative approach. Based on anatomical understanding [ 4 , 5 ] . The ongoing experimentation and clinical studies resulted in a more precise understanding of the metastatic nodal patterns in head and neck malignancies [ 2 , 6 ] . The resulting data allowed for a more conservative approach depending on the negligible risk of involvement of certain nodal regions in various oncologic scenarios ending in a wide range of surgical procedures. This variation called for an updated classifi cation and nomenclature of operations involving surgical excision of the cervical lymphatics. In order to achieve this, AAO-HNS sponsored the work of the Committee of Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology to develop a unifi ed classifi cation of neck dissection operations.

Exclusion of malignancy is in fact the fi rst and the single most important aim sought by the physician when evaluating CLA. The incidence of malignancy in patients with CLA seems to vary considerably with their demographics: age, gender, and race. The rate of malignant etiologies rises with age . A cross-sectional study by Biswas et al. [ 19 ] demonstrated that the rate of malignancy among patients with CLA was 12.1 %, 21.7 %, and 100 % in the age groups <14, 15-59, and \u226560 years, respectively. In their study, Shakya et al.

The trapezius muscle represents the lateral border of the lateral neck compartment. The SAN runs parallel to the trapezius muscle over the levator muscle of the scapula. The nerve itself is rarely invaded by tumor but is often surrounded by LNs. It should be carefully dissected from the adjacent tissues upward to the cranial part of the SCM muscle (Figs. 8.24 and 8.25 ). A plexus of branches from the cervical sensory nerves (lesser occipital, greater auricular, supraclavicular, and transverse cervical nerves) is located caudal and parallel to the SAN and the phrenic nerve, and these nerves should be preserved when possible (Fig. 8.26 ). The GAN turns toward the SCM muscle near this point (Fig. 8.27 ). In this area, too, care must be taken to preserve the branch of the occipital artery, which vascularizes partly the SCM muscle. The occipital artery represents the upper posterior limit of the dissection of the lateral compartment. The dissection continues to the prevertebral fascia. The tissue behind and above the SAN is mobilized from the nerve itself and is dissected upward from the levator muscle of the scapula and splenius muscle of the head (Fig. 8.28 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 802, "end": 812, "text": "(Fig. 8.26", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 868, "end": 878, "text": "(Fig. 8.27", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1343, "text": "(Fig. 8.28", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "8.4"}, {"text": "The inferior, lateral, and upper posterior parts of the dissection are completed, and the specimen is passed underneath the SCM muscle, which is now retracted laterally.
