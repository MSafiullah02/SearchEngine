Wheezing was defined as a high\u2010pitched whistling sound in expiration with breathing difficulty 1. The guardian was interviewed using a standardized health questionnaire.

The patients were ready for discharge when difficulty of breathing had passed. After discharge, respiratory symptoms (rhinitis, cough, and wheezing) were recorded on a daily symptom diary for 2 wk.

As rhinovirus infection is closely linked to wheezing status, atopy, and increasing of age 3, 7, the dominance of rhinovirus in our findings may also be explained by our solely wheezing cohort, high prevalence of atopic characteristics (56%), and the relatively high mean age (12 months) of the study patients.

This finding supports the hypothesis that children susceptible to rhinovirus\u2010induced wheezing may already have a chronic, partly atopy\u2010related inflammation in the lower respiratory tract manifesting as cough, and this condition is exacerbated by rhinovirus infection 4. Importantly, already the first rhinovirus\u2010induced wheezing episode has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing as a long\u2010term sequel and this risk may be even greater if the patient has atopic characteristics or a family history of asthma 2, 7. In the cohort of slightly older children with recurrent wheezing, many studies have linked rhinovirus\u2010induced wheezing to atopic characteristics, that is, specific IgE sensitization, increased eosinophil count, atopic eczema, and maternal atopic asthma 1, 3, 13, 25, 26.",

Traditional bronchiolitis with non\u2010specific noisy breathing is typically an RSV\u2010induced illness in infants, whereas wheezing typically occurs in older children and links more closely to rhinovirus 2, 7, 9. Thus wheezing, being our inclusion criterion, biases the prevalence numbers toward rhinovirus. The terms \u2018rhinovirus\u2010induced wheezing\u2019 and \u2018RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis\u2019 well describe the typical clinical picture of these illnesses. In agreement with previous studies, RSV etiology has been linked to hospitalization 12, 28 and not to atopic characteristics 25, 29.",

Earlier HBoV DNA has been found in up to 20% of respiratory samples from wheezing children aged <24 months, but with serology HBoV infections, detection rate has increased to 27%, indicating that serological diagnosis is not only more accurate, but also more sensitive for HBoV diagnostics 14, 16. These numbers together suggest that HBoV commonly causes lower airway symptoms. Of our study patients, only two older children (10% of our HBoV cases) appeared to have prolonged HBoV shedding. The number is too low to allow for a comparison with previous studies, which have indicated HBoV shedding in up to 38% of the cases 16, 30. In agreement with previous studies, HBoV did become more prevalent with age in childhood and was not associated with illness severity 14, 16. HBoV\u2010induced bronchiolitis/wheezing has not been associated with atopic characteristics as was also observed in our study 3, 25, 29.",

However, the coinfection rate can be as high as 51% among wheezing children aged <24 months 15. In our study, PIV, HBoV, and RSV were significantly linked to virus coinfections. The high coinfection rates of PIV and HBoV are in concordance with previous studies 15, 16, whereas RSV has not shown close associations with the presence of other viruses 15. Even though in our study rhinovirus was the most often detected virus (81%) in coinfections, it was not\u2014due its overall high prevalence\u2014statistically associated with them. This emphasizes its role as a single causative agent of wheezing. Importantly, we found coinfections with up to four different viruses, which highlights the need of quantitative PCR with standardized sampling procedures and serology. These methods in turn would give more accurate information on which virus is actively replicating at the very moment, and which viral infections are incipient or waning as reviewed in Jartti et al. 10. Virus\u2013virus cross talk may also modulate the immune responses of viruses in coinfections, as we have recently shown between HBoV and rhinovirus 17. The association between coinfections and longer duration of wheezing may, however, indicate a more severe illness, due to either simultaneous, or more often, consecutive viral infections 23, 24.",

Rhinovirus is an important etiologic agent already at the first wheezing episode and it closely associates with age, atopic characteristics, and parental smoking. In the age\u2010group of this study, rhinovirus was more closely linked to wheezing than RSV. While RSV was associated with hospitalization, rhinovirus was linked to prolonged cough suggesting a more chronic type of illness in children susceptible to rhinovirus\u2010induced wheezing. HBoV was the third most prevalent lower airway pathogen. It was not linked to atopic characteristics, and prolonged HBoV shedding was rare in this cohort. Our results call attention to the differences in clinical characteristics between these three major viral causes of wheezing in clinical practice and research 4.",
