For instance, the oscillatory phase of the sensorimotor rhythms has been shown to change perceptual thresholds and behavioral responses [6-10] using correlative approaches. For transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), post-hoc estimation of EEG-defined brainstate at the time of stimulation is problematic, because the large stimulation artefact prevents use of standard signal processing methods (e.g. band-pass filtering) which require a window of data both before and after the time point of interest. Additionally, post-hoc evaluation of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude modulation by EEG phase requires a substantial number of trials per phase bin to achieve sufficient statistical power due to the well-known large inter-trial variability of MEP amplitudes [11, 12] .",

One salient feature of neurophysiological recordings are pronounced oscillatory rhythms, but the functional implications of these oscillations are not yet clear [1, 2] . A characterization of relevant brain states is challenging: what part of the signal is essential and what part is incidental? Additionally, how can we determine that a putative state-signature is functionally relevant? One promising approach uses brain-state triggered brain-stimulation to assess whether different EEG-derived state-signatures at the time of stimulation lead to different evoked potentials. Based on the hypothesis that oscillations organize cortical responses [3] [4] [5] , the goal is to understand how different activity states lead to different functional consequences. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the quences of different brain states to be probed in a causal manner and increases statistical power by preferentially targeting specific oscillatory phases. In the context of the motor system, a recent study [13] demonstrated a dependence of corticospinal excitability and plasticity on the phase of the cortical \u00b5-rhythm using a real-time triggered EEG-TMS system. Larger MEP amplitudes were elicited by stimulation at time of \u00b5-rhythm surface negative peak (N) compared to \u00b5-rhythm positive peak (P). In that study, a fixed stimulation intensity (eliciting MEPs of on average of 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude or using a fixed stimulus intensity of 120% of MEP threshold) was used to examine the effects of ongoing brain activity on corticospinal excitability.",

Each TMS pulse was individually triggered through an external trigger input from the real-time system. Stimulation intensity was set programmatically using an analog control interface between 0-5 V and corresponding to 0-100% of maximum stimulator output through an analog output port interface (UEI PD2-MF-64-500/16L, United Electronic Instruments, USA) from the real-time system to allow for randomized ordering of intensity conditions. Stimulation was applied to the hand representation of left primary motor cortex (M1). The motor hot spot was identified as the coil position and orientation resulting consistently in maximum MEP amplitudes [15] . The target muscle was the muscle which responded to the lowest stimulator intensity and was then subsequently used to determine resting motor threshold (RMT) as the lowest intensity that elicited MEPs with a peak-to-peak amplitude of at least 50 \u00b5V in 5 out of 10 trials [16] .

Briefly, an algorithm implemented in Simulink Real-Time (Mathworks Ltd, USA, R2016a) was used for real-time data acquisition, data processing and as the TMS stimulator control system. The algorithm was executed on an xPC Target processor (DFI-ACP CL630-CRM mainboard), processing online EEG data streamed through a real-time ethernet interface from the Digital Out interface of the EEG main unit in data packets at a rate of 1 kHz. The EEG signal used for real-time triggering was comprised of EEG channels overlying left sensorimotor cortex (C3, CP1, CP5, FC1, FC5), which were combined in a C3-centered Laplacian montage [17] . Data was down-sampled to 1 kHz by averaging and a sliding window of data of 500 ms width was used to compute estimates of instantaneous phase. The signal window was bandpass filtered (finite impulse response filter with order 128 and pass band 8-12 Hz), the last 64 ms were discarded because of edge artefacts and then forward predicted by an autoregressive model (Yule-Walker, order 30) for 128 ms. The analytic signal was computed by fast Fourier transform-based Hilbert transform, which was used to determine the instantaneous phase. In addition, the power spectrum was calculated from a sliding window of \u00b5-positive peak trial (P) \u00b5-negative peak trial (N) (c) EEG \u00b5-phase-triggered stimulation is performed, according to the instantaneous phase from the Laplace-filtered C3-signal.

(3) a predefined \u00b5-power threshold is met. The power-threshold was adjusted on an individual participant basis at the beginning of the experiment such that a median ISI of 2 seconds resulted.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment. 17 right-handed participants (5 male, 12 female, mean age: 25.4 \u00b1 2.6 years, age range: 22-32, average laterality score in Edinburgh handedness survey: 0.90 \u00b1 0.12) with no history of neurological disease and usage of CNS drugs were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) RMT of right FDI or APB muscle <= 62.5% of maximum stimulator output (MSO), so that a stimulation intensity range of up to 160% MSO (1.6*62.5%=100% MSO) could be explored. (2) The presence of a \u00b5-rhythm with sufficient signalto-noise ratio (SNR), as an adequate SNR is required for the phase-detection algorithm to estimate phases with sufficient accuracy. SNR was evaluated as follows (similar to Nikulin and Brismar [18] ): A power function (c \u00b7 x \u03b1 ) was fitted to the 1/f noise of the resting EEG data power spectrum from Laplacefiltered C3-electrode of each individual participant. For that, data points from frequency bins with typically no oscillatory components present (0.5-8 Hz, 30-40 Hz) were used. The fitted noise was subtracted from the power spectrum. The adjusted power in the 8-13 Hz band was assessed for a clearly identifiable peak in the \u00b5-range, with 5 dB over noise level as inclusion threshold. Two participants were excluded from the experiment, one because of excessive pre-innervation in the EMG (with 54.1% of trials discarded according to the predefined threshold criterion), the other because the MEPs evoked by the fitted intensities for phase-dependent stimulation differed greatly (by 98.4%) from the IO curve fitted on median MEPs recorded in the pre-experiment, likely due to a coil position mismatch. This resulted in a sample size of 15 participants. Experiments were performed in accordance with current TMS safety guidelines [19] . All participants tolerated the procedures without any adverse effects.",

Peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes were determined within the interval of 20-60 ms after TMS pulse. All MEP time courses were inspected manually and non-response amplitudes were set to zero. Trials of the three phase-dependent blocks were pooled. For one participant, the last phasedependent block was discarded because of excessive coil drift. The C3-centered EEG-Laplace filter extracted \u00b5-rhythm pre-stimulation activity (500 ms before stimulation) was manually inspected for artefacts, and corresponding trials were discarded. Overall, 7.8% of trials were discarded for the phase-dependent stimulation sessions. We evaluated the relative as well as the absolute MEP differences between Nand P-trials. We quantified the relative phase-modulation by calculating the ratio median(MEPN) median(MEPP) and the absolute phasemodulation by calculating median(MEPN)\u2212median(MEPP) IOCmax for each intensity condition, respectively, where IOC max is the median MEP evoked at intensity 160% RMT, measuring the individual IO curve saturation level.

We replicated the dependence of MEP amplitude on phase of the sensorimotor \u00b5-rhythm at the time of TMS (i.e., larger MEP amplitudes at the negative peak of the \u00b5-rhythm) [13] and detected a significant difference between N-and P-trials in four out of five intensity conditions. The effect of stimulation intensity on modulation by \u00b5-phase was assessed as relative and absolute differences between N-and P-trials. The mean N/P-ratio decreased with higher intensity, (Fig. 3b) . MEP amplitudes at the \u00b5-negative peak were on average between 101% (at SI 10% max , corresponding on average to 105% RMT, p = 0.006, two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and 8% (at SI 90% max , corresponding on average to 138% RMT, p>0.05) larger than MEPs evoked at the \u00b5-positive peak. The N/P-difference peaked at the intermediate intensity SI 50% max , with a group average difference between N-and P-trials of 10.5% of IOC max (Fig. 3c) . The measures for individual participants are shown in supplementary Figs. S2 and S3. For the participant with the largest observed N/P-ratio, the phase-dependent stimulation MEPs are lower compared to the random-phase stimulation IO curve (participant S16, supplementary Fig. S1e ). This leads to increased N/P-ratio-values and to deviation from the N/P-ratio computed from the logistic fit (Fig. 3b) . Variability of MEPs is higher at low intensities, as measured by the coefficient of variation (across participants, mean CV 10% max =1.34, CV 30% max =0.81, CV 50% max =0.66, CV 70% max =0.53, CV 90% max =0.43).

Using only 90 trials, these values decline to 50% and 28%, respectively. This demonstrates that the required number of trials to differentiate between \u00b5-phase-defined states with high statistical power within participants can be reduced by choosing a lower stimulation intensity. In this analysis, also non-responders (i.e. participants without a significant phasemodulation for any tested stimulation intensity) are included, as the goal of this analysis is to show relative differences in required sample sizes between intensities. For non-responders, the null hypothesis may be true, therefore the actual statistical power at a given sample size is higher than the average probability of rejecting H 0 .

Overall, higher SNR resulted in improved performance of the phase-detection algorithm as measured by decreased standard deviation of the phase accuracy (r=-0.67, p=0.0081, Spearman rank correlation), but pronounced rhythm with high SNR did not translate to a larger phase-modulation effect. A significant sub-population of participants remained that showed a clear \u00b5-rhythm without exhibiting a clear phase-modulatory effect on MEP amplitude. Additionally, no significant correlation was observed between distance of coil to center electrode of the Laplacian filter and effect size at SI 10% max (p>0.05, Spearman rank correlation). In this study, a standard MNI brain model was used for navigation. In future studies with individual participant MRI anatomy additional factors could be investigated, such as the orientation of dipoles underlying the mean topography around the stimulation trigger (supplementary Fig. S1b ), coil position and orientation relative to the central sulcus. Therefore, the factors required for observing \u00b5-phase modulation of corticospinal excitability remain to be further elucidated.",

The reduced modulatory influence of \u00b5-rhythm at high stimulation intensities can be explained by saturation of the IO curves of MEPs. If stimulation intensity is sufficiently far above the motor threshold, any ongoing fluctuations of that threshold influence behavioral outcomes to a lesser degree and will result in smaller relative differences between N-and P-trials.

Based on this study, the intensity setting resulting in an average MEP amplitude 20% of IOC max would be recommended; in our dataset, this corresponded to a stimulus intensity of on average 112% RMT, with 10 of the 15 participants in our sample in the range between 108-117 %RMT. However, depending on the IO curve, a stimulation intensity based on a fixed RMT percentage can already be in the saturation range of an individual participant, where MEP amplitudes do not significantly differ between \u00b5-phase conditions. Measuring the individual IO curve and specifically estimating the maximum amplitude at saturation is therefore helpful to choose an optimal intensity.",

Nevertheless, sub-threshold TMS does affect cortical circuits, as can be demonstrated, for instance, in pairedpulse paradigms (e.g., [25, 26] ), with pre-innervation [27] , or in TMS evoked EEG potentials [28, 29] . It is therefore feasible (using paired-pulse protocols, performing stimulation during pre-innervation, or using cortical EEG responses) to investigate in subsequent studies whether EEG-defined brain-states can be differentiated at intensities below single-pulse RMT.",

High SNR alone is not sufficient for a large effect, as in our data set, there are participants with high SNR but no modulation of MEP amplitude by \u00b5-phase. Furthermore, the standard Laplacian C3 filter may not extract the functionally relevant oscillatory component, depending on individual anatomical features. Future studies may improve this aspect by using individualized spatial filters or anatomically guided source level analysis. This may also increase the proportion of participants which can be studied with phase-dependent brain stimulation, as in this study only participants with a \u00b5-rhythm as detected by a standard C3 Hjorth montage were included, whereas individualized approaches will yield increased SNR for oscillatory components.",
