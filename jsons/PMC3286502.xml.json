Additionally, the donor is serologically examined, to exclude possible transmission of infections, such as HIV and hepatitis (Strong et al. 1996; Shutkin 1954; Patel and Trampuz 2004; Karcher 1997). The serological tests are carried out at least 6 months after surgery to avoid type II error (false negative): if the patient was infected at the time of surgery, the test will provide conclusive evidence of this.
