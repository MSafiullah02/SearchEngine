            "text": "The reasons behind the evolutionary success of mammals and other multicellular organisms is their extraordinary capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions and survive by maintaining their homeostasis (1). Homeostasis refers to the relative stability in the activity of the physiological systems of the organism that are essential to support life (2). The process of maintaining stability within a harmless range via homeostatic physiologic corrections to both predictable and unpredictable adverse forces or stressors is termed \u201ceustasis\u201d (2). In the course of human evolution, homeostatic corrections have emerged to increase the host's ability to cope with adverse or even catastrophic events (3). These responses are shaped by trade-offs, sometimes with benefits and disadvantages in different periods of the life cycle (4). Following the Cambrian explosion, about 450 million years ago, when multicellular organisms\u2014originally formed in water environments\u2014colonized the land physiological homeostatic changes emerged to allow survival. These corrective changes were essential to mammalian species evolution and emerged to solve a frequent conflict between environmental changes and preservation of the individual allowing survival and, hence, reproduction. These alterations permitted progression to future generations i.e., survival of the species through the active process of natural selection (5). These corrections involved profound neural, metabolic and immune changes mediated by a few major physiological systems (e.g., the central nervous, autonomic, cardiorespiratory, endocrine, and immune systems), and acting through integrated crosstalk pathways, that was associated with appropriate responses throughout the organism (5). Such changes have been relatively conserved across many vertebrates, including mammalian species (6, 7). They have evolved to allow coping with lack of energy, dehydration, hemorrhage, infections, toxic substances, or relatively short-lived inflammatory responses, such as those of wound healing or exposure to foreign substances (7).",

This condition is different from healthy homeostasis or eustasis and is called \u201callo-stasis\u201d or different (allo)-stasis or even more accurately \u201ccaco (bad) \u2013stasis. The cumulative cost of cacostasis for the organism, has been called allostatic or cacostatic burden. Excessive or prolonged cacostatic burden results in severe acute and/or chronic cacostatic pathology (2, 8). The intensive care unit (ICU) stress state represents a new and very different ecosystem from those within which humans evolved in the past. Actually, critical illness epitomizes an acute and/or chronic cacostatic burden that goes beyond an evolutionarily conserved physiological adaptive response, and if left untreated it could rapidly exhaust homeostatic compensation and lead to death of an organism (lethal cacostasis). In critically ill patients, the need for vital organ support (maintenance of arterial blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, and other support measures, which were not available until the middle of the last century), reflects near exhaustion or exhaustion of (i) neuroendocrine homeostatic compensation, also known as \u201ccritical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency\u201d (CIRCI) (8); (ii) cell bio-energetic and other functions; and (iii) reserves of vital micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Even when it allows survival of the patient, homeostatic failure, ranging in acuity and severity, has a major impact on morbidity and mortality during and after hospitalization. CIRCI-associated dysregulated systemic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are central to the increased morbidity and mortality of acute and/or chronic critical illness and the subject of this review.",

            "text": "In multicellular organisms, the innate immune system with its recognition and signaling mechanisms is the most ancient form of host defense to infectious and non-infectious threats during evolution (9). The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) system, a \u201crapidly-acting\u201d primary transcription factor regulated cellular response, is a central activator of innate immunity. It appears that the NF-\u03baB was incorporated into this ancient signaling pathway more than 420 million years ago, and has been shown to play independent roles in vertebrate and insect lineages (9, 10). In most cell types, the inactive form of NF-\u03baB, a heterodimeric protein composed of the DNA-binding proteins p65 and p50, is retained in the cytosol by association with inhibitory factors, such as I\u03baB proteins; when activated, the latter are rapidly phosphorylated and degraded via the proteasomal pathway, liberating NF-\u03baB and allowing it to translocate into the nucleus (11). In tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-stimulated HeLa cells, a genome-wide study identified 12,552 genome binding sites of p65 (12). Among the 1,667 distinct NF-\u03baB target genes identified, NF-\u03baB controlled the expression of 249 target genes, including inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory enzymes, adhesion molecules, and immune system receptors, which are known to orchestrate the integrated inflammatory and immune responses. Interestingly, an additional 626 identified NF-\u03baB target genes were involved in metabolic processes (13).",

The main effectors of systemic inflammation are the inflammatory cytokines, the acute-phase reactants, and the peripheral effectors of the sensory afferent nervous system. The inflammatory cytokines include TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, chemokines, and other mediators of inflammation. The acute-phase reactants are mostly of hepatic origin and include the C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. During the acute-phase reaction, myelopoiesis is favored at the expense of both lymphopoiesis and hematopoiesis, explaining in part the persistent lymphopenia and anemia of critical illness (18). Substance P is an example of an effector of the sensory afferent nervous system, while hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), vasopressin, cortisol, the catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine), and peripheral neuronal CRH represent effectors of the stress system [reviewed in (19)].",

Evidence from the literature on severe sepsis (22\u201330), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (31\u201335), and trauma (14, 36) provides strong support that the degree of NF-\u03baB-driven elevation in inflammatory biomarkers at ICU entry and during ICU stay correlates with disease severity and hospital mortality (33, 37\u201339). In addition to elevated inflammatory markers, critically ill patients have profound activation of the coagulation system (elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, and reduced levels of the anticoagulant proteins, protein C and antithrombin) and evidence of endothelial cell activation with disturbed vascular integrity that correlates with disease severity and outcome (see section Endothelium) (40\u201342). Evidence that hemostasis and inflammation evolved from a single-triggered mechanism can be traced back more than 450 million years ago, based on studies with the horse-shoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) (43).",

The expression of FK506 is stimulated by glucocorticoids and has an inhibitory effect on GR signaling, preventing the nuclear translocation of GR. If short-lived, this negative feedback mechanism to reduce GC signaling may be important to restore HPA axis homeostasis. However, aging and certain stress-related phenotypes are associated with epigenetic up-regulation of FKBP5 via decreases in DNA methylation at selected enhancer-related FKBP5 sites, promoting NF-\u03baB\u2013related peripheral inflammation and chemotaxis, and heightened cardiovascular risk (56). Importantly, translational research indicates that the type of response (regulated or dysregulated) is established early in critical illness (14, 31, 57), and the previously espoused hypotheses of the second-hit model (14, 22), or the two-phase model (compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome) are now both considered obsolete (29, 58, 59).",

All of these substances are crucial to adaptation to stressors.

Its synthesis depends entirely on scavenger receptor class B type-I (SR-BI)-mediated cholesteryl ester selective uptake from circulating high-density (HDLs) and low-density (LDLs) lipoproteins (60). In critically ill patients, low serum HDL levels correlate negatively with circulating TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels (61, 62), and positively with mortality (61, 63). The combined effects of reduced HDL and SR-BI during systemic inflammation may lead to significant reductions in glucocorticoid production (64). Low HDL (65) and low total cholesterol (66) correlate with inadequate response to ACTH stimulation. In septic shock, prolonged glucocorticoid administration is associated with significant increase in total cholesterol levels within 3 days of treatment (66).",

Within tissues, glucocorticoids are regulated at the pre-receptor level by the isozymes of 11\u03b2- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD), which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glucocorticoids (GCs) bind to the ligand-binding domain of GR\u03b1 to produce a biological response. Because of their lipophilic nature, GCs can readily diffuse across cellular membranes to bind to their intracellular receptor and produce a biological/pharmacological response [Figure 2; (15, 68, 69)]. The glucocorticoid receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor (NRs) (70) superfamily that emerged in the vertebrate lineage ~420\u2013440 million years ago (similarly to NF-\u03baB) from sequential duplications of two ancestral genes, those of the estrogen and the glucocorticoid receptors; the latter ultimately evolved into the glucocorticoid and the mineralocorticoid receptors (67, 71). Underlying its essential role in formation and regulation of multicellular life, the GR is required to establish the necessary cellular context for maintaining normal uterine biology and fertility through the regulation of uterine-specific actions (72) while GRs are vital for the structural and functional maturation of fetal organs (73, 74), affecting almost 4,000 genes (75). In late gestation of mammals, fetal glucocorticoid levels rise dramatically, an essential step for maturation in preparation for life after birth. Also, an association was found between greater maternal affection and warmth in early life and increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor genes in the offspring resulting in long-term health benefits (76).",

However, GR levels within the cell are not static, but are tightly controlled by numerous factors and at multiple levels. Notably, 16 variants of the human GR (hGR) have been identified to date with the potential of at least 256 combinations of homo- and hetero-dimers (68). Recent research indicates that the expression of different GR transcriptional and translational isoforms might be a significant factor determining how GCs influence the biological function and activity of specific cells and tissues (75). In contrast to GR\u03b1, the alternatively transcribed GR\u03b2, which resides primarily in the cell nucleus, does not bind glucocorticoid, but can form homodimers with itself or heterodimers with a GR\u03b1 subtype, functioning as an antagonist of GR\u03b1. GR\u03b2 homodimers can interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the DNA, however their binding does not activate transcription (69). Generally, GR\u03b2 is expressed at very low levels compared to GR\u03b1; however, its expression is increased in inflammatory diseases, including critical illness, and this might be associated with decreased sensitivity to GCs and CIRCI (79).",

In stimulated HeLa and neuronal PC12 cells, genome-wide studies identified 8,306 and 2,252 GR genomic binding sites upon treatment with GC, respectively (12, 81). Of interest, the availability of these binding sites for interacting with the GC-GR complex depends on the chromatin landscape, which is tissue- and cell type-specific, explaining to some extent, why the GR has a certain effect on one tissue and a totally different effect on another (67). Thus, even though the signaling system is the same, the landscape of the landing site is not. Thus, different cells recognize these signals differently, resulting in a highly context-dependent action by glucocorticoids (67).",

Glucocorticoids regulation of mitochondrial transcription via activation of mtGRE was the subject of a recent review (53). In pathway (i), the activated GC-GR\u03b1 complex interacts directly with activated transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1, leading to the transcriptional repression of major downstream proinflammatory factors. In pathway (ii), GC-GR\u03b1 binds to positive (transactivation) or negative (transrepression) specific DNA regions, the glucocorticoid-response elements (GREs) on the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (83), to directly regulate transcription of target genes. Finally, GC activation of membrane-bound GR rapidly induces the activity of several kinases, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways [Figure 2; (69)]. The non-genomic effects of GCs clearly differ from their well-known genomic effects, with the former responding within several minutes independently of protein synthesis. Genomic studies have shown that the GC-GR\u03b1 complex regulates more than 3,000 genes in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors (84), in human pulmonary type II cells (85), and several organs, including the heart (86), liver (87, 88), and uterus (72) of unstimulated mice, underscoring its essential role as a master modulator in sustaining life and restoring health. The discordance between the number of regulated genes and the GR sites (12, 81) suggests that multiple sites are involved in the regulation of a single gene and/or that binding of a transcription factor is not sufficient to drive gene expression (12).",

Busillo and Cidlowski (92) recently reviewed the master regulatory role played the activated GC-GR\u03b1 complex in the three major phases of homeostatic correction involved in disease development and resolution (Figure 3). While distinctions are made between the different states, variable degrees of overlap are likely. First, in the pro-inflammatory phase, GC-GR\u03b1 prime the innate immune system to remove or neutralize pathogens by: (i) inducing the expression of Toll-like receptor 2, NOD-like receptor pyrin containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and purinergic receptor P2Y2R; (ii) repressing adaptive immunity (energy conservation); and (iii) cooperating with pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-\u03baB and activator protein 1 (AP-1) in promoting leukocyte redistribution. The GC induction of NLRP3 sensitizes the cells to extracellular ATP and significantly enhances the ATP-mediated release of proinflammatory molecules, including mature IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 (93). In addition, inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, nitric oxide, and GCs trigger and modulate the systemic and hepatic acute phase protein response (94). In stimulated HeLa cells, a genome-wide study identified 1,932 gene collectively regulated by the activation of NF-\u03baB and GR\u03b1, with 43% of regulated genes responding only when both ligands are added, indicating that GR\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB crosstalk alters signaling pathways that are regulated by each factor separately (12).",

In addition, inflammatory cytokines increase the expression and enzymatic activity of 11\u03b2 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD1), which converts the inactive cortisone to the active cortisol in different cell types, as for example occurs after addition of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 on endothelial (99) or lung epithelial cells (100). Thus, cytokines seem to amplify GC bioavailability (101). Microarray studies have shown that TNF-\u03b1 and GC synergistically co-regulate 210 genes involved in inflammation (100). In this context, the synergy between GCs and pro-inflammatory cytokines is a useful mechanism for rapidly re-enforcing initial pro-inflammatory responses. Importantly, GC-GR\u03b1 is necessary to prevent excessive phagocytic cell activation and improve intracellular bacterial killing (102).",

As downregulation of systemic and tissue inflammation continues, the activated GC-GR\u03b1 engages in a host of pro-resolution mechanisms changing, among others, the phenotype of both granulocytes and macrophages. In these immune cells, via genomic mechanisms, GC-GR\u03b1 increases the expression of AnnexinA1 (AnxA1), AnxA1 receptor (ALXR), and glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), while via non-genomic mechanisms it increases the secretion of AnxA1 (107\u2013109). The coordinated action of GILZ and AnxA1 is essential to regulating resolution (109). Granulocytes undergo constitutive apoptosis, disabling their potentially injurious secretion responses, i.e., NF\u2013\u03baB activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines, and decreasing trans-endothelial migration leading to their rapid recognition and internalization by macrophages (efferocytosis) (109\u2013112).",

            "text": "Apoptotic cells also serve as resolution cues for macrophages, which, after phagocytosis of apoptotic granulocytes, change their phenotype toward a more resolving/restorative one. The changes in phenotype from M1 (classically) to M2 (alternatively) leads to an orchestrated series of actions leading to successful resolution of inflammation. Interestingly, GCs promote phagocytosis (112, 113) and reduce the apoptotic granulocyte ingestion requirements for generation of M2 (114). GC-mediated change to M2 phenotype is associated with (i) immune silencing, where the release of inflammatory mediators and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are suppressed (114); (ii) an increased release of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 and several pro-resolving lipid mediators (114); (iii) protection from apoptosis; (iv) non-phlogistic degradation; (v) production of angiogenic growth factors; (vi) increased macrophage chemokinesis (by upregulation of genes involved in cell mobility) and lymphatic clearance; and (vii) induction of acquired immunity (110, 111, 113\u2013117). GC-mediated Annexin 1-derived peptide (Ac2\u2212\u221226) acting through the ALXR receptor has a pivotal role in the clearance of apoptotic cells (118). In models of self-resolving inflammation, various phenotypes of macrophages may coexist. In the later phase of resolution, M2 macrophages switch to the resolution-promoting macrophage (Mres) phenotype, which display reduced phagocytosis, while producing antifibrotic and antioxidant proteins that limit tissue damage and fibrosis (resolution of granulation tissue) (119). In human monocytes, GCs induce the expression of 133 genes with upregulation of anti-oxidation, migration, phagocytosis, and anti-inflammation with consequent downregulation of adhesion, apoptosis, and oxidation (113). In agreement with microarray data, spontaneous, as well as PMA-induced production of reactive oxygen species, was significantly reduced in GC-treated cells, and GCs promoted survival of an anti-inflammatory monocytic phenotype in inflammatory reactions (113).",

            "text": "Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that critical illness is associated with a significant reduction in GR\u03b1 density and transcription and an increase in GR\u03b2-mediated dominant negative activity on GR\u03b1-induced transcription. In a human cell line, activation of NF-\u03baB by TNF-\u03b1 had a direct dose- and time-dependent effect on GR levels with a disproportionate increase in GR\u03b2 over GR\u03b1 (123). Experimental sepsis is associated with decreased GR\u03b1 transcription in circulating cells (124), heart (125), lymph node-spleen (124), liver (125\u2013127), kidney (127), lung tissue (125\u2013129), and skeletal muscle (125). Moreover, the endothelial GR\u03b1 is required for protection against sepsis (see section Endothelium) (130). Importantly, the reduction of GR\u03b1 expression is rapid and persists for at least 5 days (125) while it is associated with increased GR\u03b2 expression in the heart and lung but not liver (125), and increased NF-\u03baB activation (127). Similarly, in experimental ARDS, lung tissue shows a significant reduction in GR\u03b1 expression (128, 131, 132) and an increase in GR\u03b2 expression (131), leading to decreased GR\u03b1 nuclear translocation (131). In transgenic mice, expression of GR\u03b1 above wild-type levels leads to increased resistance to LPS-induced endotoxic shock (133).",

GR\u03b1 mRNA in neutrophils correlates negatively with plasma IL-6 levels and shows gradual recovery overtime in survivors (135). In another study, neutrophil GR\u03b1 mRNA levels decreased 4-fold by day 4 in the ICU and remained low for 2 weeks (79). In ex vivo experiments with PBMCs exposed to longitudinal plasma samples from patients with ARDS results suggested that insufficient GC-GR\u03b1-mediated activity at disease onset and over time was a central mechanism for the upregulation of NF-\u03baB activity (Figure 4). Over time, patients with regulated systemic inflammation have a progressive increase in all measured GC-GR\u03b1-mediated activities, including GR\u03b1 number, binding to NF-\u03baB and to nuclear GRE, as well as increased transcription of I\u03baB\u03b1 and IL-10, and a corresponding reduction in NF-\u03baB nuclear binding, and transcription of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. In contrast, patients with dysregulated systemic inflammation had only a modest longitudinal increase in GC-GR\u03b1-mediated activities and a progressive increase in NF-\u03baB nuclear binding that was most striking in non-survivors (33). By day 3 of ARDS, no overlap was observed between groups for NF-\u03baB and GC-GR\u03b1 nuclear binding. In lung tissue obtained by open lung biopsy, histological severity correlated with increased nuclear uptake of NF-\u03baB and a lower ratio of GR\u03b1: NF-kB uptake (33). A decrease in GR\u03b1 expression in critical illness is maladaptive granted that proinflammatory pathways are not properly restrained (124).",

In experimental ARDS, low-dose glucocorticoid treatment restored GR\u03b1 number and function leading to resolution of pulmonary inflammation (129, 132). Similarly, in an ex vivo ARDS study, prolonged methylprednisolone treatment was associated with upregulation in all measurements of GR\u03b1 activity leading to reduction in NF-\u03baB DNA-binding and transcription of inflammatory cytokines [Figure 4; (103)]. Glucocorticoid treatment changes the longitudinal direction of systemic inflammation from dysregulated (NF-\u03baB-driven, maladaptive response) to regulated (GR\u03b1-driven, adaptive response) with significant improvement in indices of alveolar-capillary membrane permeability and markers of inflammation, hemostasis, and tissue repair (11).",

The endothelial lining is in continuous contact with circulating cells and soluble proteins, and the capillaries, represent the primary barrier between elements in the blood and the parenchymal cells. The space between two contiguous endothelial cells, known as the endothelial cleft (ETC), acts as an important site of regulation of endothelial (paracellular) permeability (141). Importantly, the vascular endothelium (micro- and macro-circulation) is clothed with a protective barrier, the glycocalyx, which is critical to maintain endothelial homeostasis. The endothelial glycocalyx is a negatively charged, organized mesh of membranous glycoproteins and plasma proteins that include superoxide dismutase, antithrombin III, and cell adhesion molecules, all involved in maintaining the oncotic gradient across the endothelial barrier (141). The intact glycocalyx protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress and prevents the interaction between circulating leukocytes and endothelial adhesion molecules (141). Conformational changes in glycocalyx structure lead to short bursts in the release of endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) (141), inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion, all three processes essential for patency of microcirculation. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), composed of highly specialized endothelial cells with tight junctions that seal paracellular spaces to restrict permeability, serves as a highly restrictive interface between the systemic circulatory system and the brain (142).",

In umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), upregulation of SGK-1 reduced oxidative stress and improved cell survival and senescence (159); meanwhile, GR-induced GILZ expression (see section Glucocorticoid Receptor-Alpha and Homeostatic Corrections) correlated negatively with vascular inflammation (161).

GCs play an important role in the control of vascular smooth muscle tone by their permissive effects in potentiating vasoconstrictive responses to catecholamines and other hormones, such as arginine-vasopressin, through glucocorticoid receptors (168). Finally, they inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and other vasodilatory agents in vascular endothelial cells (169).

The development of an ozone layer in the upper atmosphere to absorb damaging UV radiation from the sun, a derived outcome of increased atmospheric oxygen, permitted organisms to live on land for the first time (175). Some groups of organisms adapted to increased oxygen levels; the most notable adaptation was the evolution of the biochemical pathways of cellular respiration, which use oxygen to extract the energy stored in organic molecules much more efficiently.",

Oxidative stress is a predictor of mortality in septic shock patients (198). Glutathione is one of the most important redox buffers of the cells, as it can be found in all cell compartments and acts as a cofactor of several enzymes, helps in DNA repair, scavenges ROS (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxides), and generates other antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid (see section Hypovitaminoses) and tocopherols (194).

In laboratory models of sepsis, mitochondrial respiration is often increased in the early phase of illness, but consistently falls with protracted inflammation [reviewed in (202)]. Many clinical studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetic failure as an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying dysregulated systemic inflammation-associated multiorgan dysfunction. In a study of skeletal muscle biopsies obtained in septic patients, an association was first reported between nitric oxide overproduction, antioxidant depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased ATP concentrations, with progression of multiorgan failure and mortality (203). Human septic cardiomyopathy is accompanied by widespread down-regulation of cardiac mitochondrial genes and decrease in the expression of genes that govern cardiac myocyte contractility, analogous to the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in myocardial hibernation (204). Early sepsis is associated with a reduction in PBMC mitochondrial copy number, and a rise in markers of mitochondrial damage, in a linear relation to proinflammatory cytokine expression (205). The PBMCs of patients with severe vs. less severe pneumonia have increased ROS density, increased DNA damage, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentrations (206). Loss of mitochondrial function may lead to compensatory secondary metabolism, glycolysis, to produce ATP as well as lactate (207). A epithelial cell line study demonstrated that this glycolytic switch is promoted by the activation of the redox sensitive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and subsequent inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) resulting in increased production of inflammatory cytokines and reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids (207).",

In contrast to nuclear DNA, which is non-immunogenic, mitochondrial DNA resembles bacterial DNA (see section Cellular Energetics\u2014Mitochondrial Function) and acts as a damage-associated molecular pathogen (DAMP) to activate immune responses through Toll-like receptor 9-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB (209) and the NLRP3 inflammasome (210). Also, in comparison to nuclear DNA, mtDNA is 50-fold more sensitive to oxidative stress (191), as its close proximity to the electron transport chain and the absence of chromatin proteins makes it an easy target for oxidative damage (197).",

The central role of mitochondria in essential physiological processes has rendered these organelles a receiver and integrator hub of multiple regulatory signals (215). Mitochondria participate in the stress response, in part, by sensing levels of glucocorticoids (183). It is now accepted that mitochondria are under GC control because GRs are present in mitochondria, and GREs reside in the mitochondrial genome (82, 192). A number of studies in several tissues have observed a cytoplasmic-to-mitochondrion GR translocation or vice versa in response to GC, indicating that mitochondrial GR is dynamically regulated upon exposure to GCs (69). Lee and collaborators have classified five pathways in the functional modulation of the mitochondria by GC-GR (82). In addition to direct mitochondrial GR-mtGRE interactions, mitochondrial gene expression is regulated indirectly by nuclear GR-nuGRE interactions that result in increased transcription of the following: (i) genes encoding OXPHOS and other mitochondrial regulatory functions, (ii) transcription factors for control of nuDNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins, and (iii) several antioxidant mechanisms including uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) (69, 82, 113, 192, 216, 217). Of interest, mitochondrial thioredoxin, an antioxidant and anti-apoptotic factor essential for cell viability and vascular homeostasis (218), interacts directly with both the ligand and the DNA-binding domains of GR, keeping the receptor in a reduced, transcriptionally active form (219, 220).",

Altogether, there is substantial evidence that cross-talk between neuroendocrine control of the stress response and cellular antioxidant systems is essential for mammalian homeostatic regulation (220). Consistent with the cacostatic load model (21), administration of physiological doses of GCs acutely increases mitochondrial membrane potential, calcium buffering capacity, anti-oxidant capacity, and resistance to apoptotic signaling (8), whereas chronic exposure to high doses of GCs suppresses anti-oxidant capacity, decreases mitochondrial membrane potential, and sensitizes cells to apoptosis (21, 187, 190).",

In human monocytes, spontaneous, as well as phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA)-induced production of reactive oxygen species, is significantly reduced in GC-treated cells in comparison to controls (113). In murine macrophages, glucocorticoid treatment is associated with rapid (non-genomic) inhibition of superoxide anion production (231). In murine sepsis, GC treatment attenuated renal dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial injury with preservation of cytochrome c oxidase and suppression of pro-apoptotic protein levels (232). In clinical (233, 234) and experimental (162, 235) randomized trials, participants with severe sepsis receiving GC treatment had, in comparison to controls, a significant reduction in (i) circulating nitric oxide levels (162, 233, 235), and (ii) spontaneous release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by neutrophils (234).",

After ingestion, free thiamine is converted to the active form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), commonly known as vitamin B1, by thiamine pyrophosphokinase. The majority of TPP in the body is found in erythrocytes and accounts for ~80% of the body's total storage (238). Thiamine pyrophosphate is a key co-factor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, transketolase, and branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase (238). Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the gatekeeper for entry into the Krebs Cycle, without which pyruvate would be converted to lactate as opposed to acetyl-coenzyme A. Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is required for completion of the Krebs Cycle once it has begun. Transketolase is a key enzyme for the pentose phosphate pathway and for the production of NADPH with glutathione cycling, an important anti-oxidant pathway (239). There are also other proposed non-cofactor roles of thiamine within the immune system, gene regulation, oxidative stress response, cholinergic activity, chloride channel function, and neurotransmission (238).",

A thiamine deficiency syndrome, beriberi, bears a number of similarities to sepsis, including peripheral vasodilation, cardiac dysfunction, and elevated lactate levels (237). In critical illness, the prevalence of thiamine deficiency is 10\u201320% upon admission (198, 240) and can increase up to 71% during ICU stay, suggesting rapid depletion of this vitamin (198). Based on limited data, no association was detected between thiamine levels, markers of oxidative stress (198) and mortality (198, 241). In one study, a significant negative correlation was reported between thiamine and lactic acid levels in patients with sepsis without liver dysfunction (240). In a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with septic shock (n = 88), the administration of thiamine (200 mg twice a day for 7 days) reduced lactate levels and improved mortality over time in a pre-defined subgroup of patients with thiamine deficiency (35% of cohort) (239). In a retrospective, single-center, matched cohort study, administration of thiamine within 24 h of septic shock (n = 123) was associated with improved likelihood of lactate clearance and a reduction in 28-day mortality (242). Despite some promising results, there is insufficient evidence to support or reject thiamine supplementation as a monotherapy in critically ill patients (238).",

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor gene family and is expressed in virtually all nucleated cells. Decreased serum levels of vitamin D have been associated with several autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Genome-and transcriptome-wide studies indicate that vitamin D signaling modulates many inflammatory responses on several levels (245), including interference with NF-\u03baB, via upregulation of I\u03baB expression (246). In addition, the ability of vitamin D to inhibit metabolic stress and energy expenditure in a cell microenvironment suggests that this pleiotropic hormone has a broad task as a pro-survival agent (244).",

The anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D was consistently observed in studies of cell lines and human PBMCs, and was the subject of a comprehensive review (248). PBMCs activated with TLR ligands after incubation with 1,25(OH)D3 showed decreased release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and increased anti-bacterial activity (249). In PBMCs, physiologic levels of vitamin D reduce inflammatory activities, by upregulating GC-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK; see section Glucocorticoid Receptor-Alpha) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) (250) to down-regulate p38 MAPK-mediated inflammatory gene expression (including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8) (251). In LPS-activated PBMCs (247) and PBMCs from patients with asthma (252), vitamin D enhanced dexamethasone-induced expression of MKP-1 (247), and this synergism was dependent on vitamin D-induced GM-CSF release (247). One study suggested that the interaction between vitamin D, glucocorticoids and their cognate receptors is related to the duration of exposure to vitamin D (253).",

Based on its pleiotropic functions, vitamin D is considered a \u201cmaster tuner\u201d in shifting homeostatic balance from a pro-inflammatory to a pro-resolving status (244). Several studies demonstrated a dose-dependent response of vitamin D with respect to reducing inflammation, with 1 nM and 10 nM concentrations causing the greatest effects (248). One study showed that serum 25(OH)D levels as high as 120 nmol/l may be necessary for optimal immune function (256). A small study in healthy patients with hypovitaminosis D reported that significant anti-inflammatory benefits of vitamin D supplementation were only seen by achieving serum 25(OH)D levels greater than 100 nmol/l (256).",

Two recent studies have evaluated the impact of vitamin D on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Primary human skeletal muscle cells treated with 1,25(OH)D3 vs. vehicle demonstrated marked effects on mitochondrial number, morphology, physiology, and expression of key mitochondrial proteins, resulting in increased ATP production (259). In vitamin D-deficient symptomatic patients, Vitamin D supplementation was found, using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to augment muscle mitochondrial maximal oxidative phosphorylation after exercise and improved symptoms of fatigue (260).

In early critical illness, vitamin D status is associated with a differential metabolic profile. Glutathione and glutamate metabolism, which play principal roles in redox regulation and immunomodulation, respectively, were significantly upregulated by vitamin D (199). However, evidence of a mortality benefit of vitamin D as monotherapy still remains uncertain (262, 263). A recent large RCT investigated a single dose of 540,000 international units of vitamin D3 in critically ill patients with 1,25(OH)D3 levels <20 ng/ml (264). By day 3, the treated group achieved a level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 46.9 \u00b1 23.2 ng/ml; measurements of systemic inflammation were not reported.

Most vertebrates can synthesize ascorbic acid from glucose-6-phospate in the liver, with synthesis increasing during stress. In humans and other primates, however, ascorbic acid cannot be synthesized and has to be obtained through the diet. This is the result of a random mutation in the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of ascorbic acid biosynthesis in the common ancestor of the teleost fish some 200 million years ago (266, 267). To date, there is no satisfactory evolutionary explanation for this apparent random loss of ascorbic acid synthetic ability.

In leukocytes, ascorbic acid content responds to variations in plasma ascorbate availability (269). Following activation, immune cells undergo dramatic metabolic reprogramming with increased aerobic glycolytic activity and fatty acid oxidation (Warburg effect) under the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) (270). The result of this change is to rapidly provide ATP and metabolic intermediates for the biosynthesis of immune and inflammatory mediators. Importantly, the hydroxylase enzymes that regulate the actions of the HIFs require ascorbate for optimal activity (269). The immune-enhancing properties of ascorbic acid regulation of HIFs include increased neutrophil and macrophage bacterial killing and phagocytic capacity (269, 271).

In response to inflammatory cytokine-mediated ACTH release from the anterior pituitary gland, the adrenal gland rapidly secretes ascorbic acid in amounts that are sufficient to increase, by several fold, plasma ascorbic acid concentrations in the adrenal vein, without increasing systemic levels (268). More than 80 years ago Hans Selye, the pioneer of stress research, reported that the adrenal glands not only contain some of the highest concentrations of ascorbic acid in the human body, but they also employ this vitamin to synthesize cortisol in the adrenal cells (272). Today, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ascorbic acid is an essential cofactor required in both adrenal mitochondrial steroidogenesis and catecholamine biosynthesis (272). The level of ascorbate in the adrenals might affect their capacity to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone, the precursor from which nearly all steroid hormones, including cortisol, are made (273). Additionally, ascorbic acid, as an antioxidant, has a positive impact on GR functions (see section Oxidative Stress and CIRCI).",

Finally, the cellular uptake of ascorbic acid, mediated by mSVCT2, is downregulated during inflammatory conditions. In a time and concentration-dependent manner, GCs increase the expression of mSVCT2, facilitating the uptake of vitamin C into cells (274), providing the rationale for combination treatment using GCs and ascorbic acid (275). Interestingly, there is a strong inverse correlation between the ability of an animal to endogenously produce vitamin C and the induction of a cortisol response when stressed (276).",

Importantly, the allostatic overload imposed by homeostatic corrections impacts negatively on both acute and long-term morbidity and mortality, while the bioenergetic and metabolic reserves to support homeostatic corrections are time limited. For these reasons it is prudent to implement early interventions designed to achieve the following: (i) reinforce innate immunity, (ii) inhibit further systemic tissue damage, (iii) limit the metabolic and bioenergetic cacostatic overload imposed during vital organ support, (iv) accelerate disease resolution, and (v) prevent persistent-chronic low-grade systemic inflammation (285).

Therefore, glucocorticoid treatment should not be viewed exclusively as anti-inflammatory or as a hormone replacement for relative adrenal insufficiency. It also is equally relevant that one should recall that full biological resolution lags weeks behind clinical resolution of an acute illness, making the clinical criteria that we frequently employ to guide duration of treatment, an inadequate reference point (291). For these reasons, glucocorticoid treatment, and other co-interventions should be directed at supporting the activated GR\u03b1 regulatory function throughout all phases of homeostatic corrections, and not limited to the acute phase of organ support.",

Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor agonist that binds to cytoplasmic receptors, activates their translocation into the nucleus and subsequently initiates the transcription of mineralocorticoid- and glucocorticoid-responsive genes (297). The inclusion or exclusion of fludrocortisone, as a co-intervention with hydrocortisone, may partly explain the differences reported in outcomes of some RCTs (see explanation for Figure 7 below) (292, 298). Other potential co-interventions directed at increasing glucocorticoid receptor expression, such as statins (299), melatonin (300), beta-blockers (301), calcium channel blockers (301), or directed at improving mitochondrial function (194, 302, 303) have not been investigated in association with glucocorticoid treatment in acute illness or alone in chronic critical illness.",

There are many variables to consider, including the type of GC to be used, timing, dosage, mode of delivery, co-interventions, duration, and tapering. Over the last 40 years, multiple randomized trials investigating GC treatment in critical illness have clearly shown that the design of a treatment protocol has a profound impact on treatment response and outcome (304, 305). The CONSORT (306) and GRADE (307) systems, while useful in evaluating the quality of a randomized trial, unfortunately lack a position on two fundamental elements of a trial design, namely the disease pathophysiology and the pharmacological principles applicable to the investigated drug. Unfortunately, lack of these specific reference points has generated misinterpretation of the literature, fueling a non-sensical controversy that clearly is not serving the patient (308).",

Early initiation of treatment, before homeostatic corrections reach exhaustion, is critical and should be directed at approaching maximal saturation of the glucocorticoid receptor (~100 mg of methylprednisolone equivalent) (309). An adequate initial loading bolus is necessary to achieve prompt elevation in plasma levels and to assure higher GR\u03b1 saturation in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane for genomic and non-genomic actions, respectively. In human monocytic cells activated with graded concentrations of LPS and then exposed to graded concentrations of methylprednisolone (Figure 7), reduction in inflammatory cytokine transcription was initially modest, then\u2014after reaching an inflection point\u2014followed by a rapid reduction, likely related to achieving maximal drug receptor saturation and adequate time for a measurable effect (102). To achieve optimal results, the initial loading bolus should be followed by an infusion (daily dose over 24 h) to rapidly achieve a steady state. In patients with septic shock, hydrocortisone administered as an infusion vs. an intermittent bolus was associated with more rapid resolution of shock (310), and fewer hyperglycemic episodes (311, 312).",

Moreover, synthetic glucocorticoids bind the glucocorticoid receptors with higher affinity and remain longer in the cell nucleus, while they bind to mineralocorticoid receptors with lower affinity than do endogenous glucocorticoids, thereby minimizing mineralocorticoid-related side effects (313). Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of systemically administered glucocorticoids are reviewed in reference (314). Hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone are the two glucocorticoids most often investigated in critical care RCTs (315). In the past, different exogenous glucocorticoids were thought to be qualitatively indistinguishable from each other because they act via the same glucocorticoid receptor, however, qualitative differences have been recently discovered, and one glucocorticoid cannot be simply replaced by another (314). While hydrocortisone was initially chosen as the drug of choice for adrenal replacement, methylprednisolone may actually offer unique advantages over hydrocortisone as follows: (i) greater affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (316); (ii) higher penetration in lung tissue (important for ARDS or pneumonia), and with longer residence time (317\u2013319), (iii) higher potency of genomic activity especially NF-\u03baB inhibitory activity (320); and (iv) higher potency of non-genomic activity (321). GR\u03b1 binding affinity, expressed as relative receptor affinity (RRA), correlates with glucocorticoid potency. The log RRAs for selected glucocorticoids are 0.95, 1.62, and 2.0 for hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, respectively (316). A comparison study between these three types of glucocorticoids is needed.",

There is some evidence that a treatment duration of 3\u20137 days directed at reducing acuity of illness (transient reduction in systemic inflammation) might shortchange the full beneficial effects of glucocorticoid therapy (322).

            "text": "While glucocorticoids have an important role in supporting homeostatic corrections, this is achieved at the expense of reversible suppression of the HPA axis. In addition, the risk of glucocorticoid treatment-associated adrenal suppression in critically ill patients with dysregulated systemic inflammation is underappreciated. It has been shown that neither the total or the highest dose, nor the duration of glucocorticoid treatment is a significant predictor of HPA axis recovery (324). In the recent \u201cReduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD trial\u201d that evaluated prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 or 14 days, adrenal suppression was detected at hospital discharge and at 30 days in 38 and 9% of patients, respectively; no differences were detected between 5 or 14 days of glucocorticoid exposure (325). Similarly to the experimental literature (326, 327), critical care RCTs have shown that abrupt glucocorticoid discontinuation after a 3-to-14 days treatment was rapidly followed by a reconstituted inflammatory response with a clinical relapse in approximately one-third of the patients (233, 322, 328, 329), and increased mortality (329). In the LaSRS trial (329), discontinuation of study drug 48 h post-extubation was associated with clinical relapse in one-quarter of methylprednisolone-treated patients. These patients were rapidly returned to mechanical ventilation (MV) without re-institution of study treatment, fared poorly, required additional days of MV and had a 9-fold increased risk of 60-day mortality (p = 0.001) in comparison to patients that did not return to MV (330). Gradual tapering is necessary to preserve the disease improvement achieved during glucocorticoid administration, to sustain continuous resolution and restoration of tissue homeostasis, to achieve gradual recovery of the suppressed HPA axis, to forestall disease relapse from reconstituted systemic inflammation, and finally to comply with the Food and Drug Administration package insert warnings (Reference ID: 3032293) (331).",

In contrast, in non-improvers NF-\u03baB increased over time while GC-GR\u03b1 had no significant changes.
