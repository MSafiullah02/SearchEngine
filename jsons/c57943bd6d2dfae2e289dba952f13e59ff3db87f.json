The disease has rapidly spread around the world after its initial recognition in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1 Pulmonary involvement with diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure has been the major disease focus in patients with COVID-19; however, recent reports have highlighted the fact that kidney injury is also relatively common in this infection and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 2, 3 In a large case series from China, 15.5% of patients show evidence of kidney injury on presentation with 3.2% developing acute kidney injury during hospitalization. 3 Hematuria and proteinuria are also common, being present in 27% and 44% of patients, respectively. 3 We present the clinical and renal biopsy findings in an African American patient with COVID-19. This case raises the question of whether people of African descent with high-risk APOL1 genotype (presence of 2 risk alleles) could be at increased risk of kidney disease in the setting of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Possible mechanisms for kidney injury in COVID-19 include direct infection of the kidney as well as cytokine storm related to sepsis. Direct infection of the renal parenchyma is possible because the renal proximal tubule cells highly express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the cellular entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 6, 7 The virus likely gains access to the kidney through the bloodstream, as approximately 15% of patients were found to have RNAemia in one series. 2 Cytokine storm has been described previously both in animal models and humans infected with other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. 8, 9 ,S1 Evidence of cytokine storm has also been documented in patients with COVID-19. 2,S2 This case report is the first renal biopsy report to our knowledge describing the renal biopsy findings 211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264   265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318 in a living patient with COVID-19. A recent report of postmortem kidney tissue from 6 patients who died of COVID-19 showed acute tubular injury without glomerular abnormalities. S3 The SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was described in renal tubules by immunohistochemical analysis in this report when the renal tissue was reacted with a rabbit monoclonal antibody directed against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Clone ID: 019; Sino Biological, Beijing, China). In our laboratory, immunohistochemical analysis of renal tissue using this antibody under numerous conditions showed nonspecific positive staining in the renal parenchyma of all kidneys. In the case presented here, in situ hybridization analysis for SARS-CoV-2 failed to show evidence of viral RNA in the kidney, suggesting that direct infection of the kidney was not present. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the virus was present below the level of detection. The biopsy from our patient is unique, as it demonstrates the presence of collapsing glomerulopathy. Acute tubular injury is commonly present on biopsy in association with collapsing glomerulopathy, and, therefore, is not necessarily being driven by either direct viral infection of the kidney or cytokine storm. The biopsy findings raise the question as to whether or not African American patients who contract COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing APOL1-related kidney disease. The reports of kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 thus far are primarily limited to Chinese patients, and therefore might not be generalizable to other populations, such as the African American patient described here. In fact, African American individuals have long been known to be at increased risk of developing kidney disease compared with other ethnicities without recent African ancestry. S4 This increased risk has been shown to largely result from 2 risk alleles in the APOL1 gene, G1 and G2, that are mutually exclusive and very common. S5 Approximately 39% of African American individuals possess one APOL1 risk allele and 13% are at increased risk of kidney disease as a result of homozygosity for APOL1 risk alleles.",

It is an aggressive form of glomerular injury that has been described in association with autoimmune disease, interferon therapy, and viral illnesses including HIV, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus. S6-S10 Regardless of the associated disease, approximately 70% of these patients with collapsing glomerulopathy are homozygous for APOL1 risk alleles. The etiology of APOL1-associated nephropathy has not been definitively determined, although there are data to support the role of innate immune pathways upregulated in viral illnesses and autoimmune disease as key drivers. S19 The Q4 renal biopsy findings in the case presented here are therefore concerning for an aggressive APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy driven by a COVID-19-related cytokine storm. However, it is also possible that the collapsing glomerulopathy is unrelated to the viral infection and was only brought to medical attention by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. web 4C=FPO Figure 2 .
