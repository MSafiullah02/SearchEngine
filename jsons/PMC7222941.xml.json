These procedures have benefited from three new methodologies originated from Italy, China, and the USA, and developed further worldwide [1]. Most haplo-HSCT cases in China followed the \u201cGIAC protocol\u201d or modifications of this protocol. The \u201cGIAC protocol\u201d comprises: granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized grafts (G), intensified immunosuppression with cyclosporine using the whole process of conditioning chemotherapy (I), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for in vivo T cell depletion (A), and combined use of bone marrow with peripheral blood stem cells as the source of grafts (C) [2].",

Nevertheless, its use is associated with an elevated incidence of infections, particularly viral infections, when high doses of ATG are administered. The effect of high doses of ATG on relapse after HSCT is under dispute. Whereas some retrospective studies suggest that ATG increases relapses, randomized studies have not produced such results. Balancing the risk-benefit ratio is the focus of the current study, as several issues remain unresolved regarding the use of ATG in HSCT; in particular, the optimal dosage of ATG has not been precisely identified.",

Different doses are required in HSCT between the two currently available brands due to the differences regarding the source of the immunizing antigen and the methods used for the development of the antibodies. Additionally, the doses also depend on the donor type (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-identical sibling, unrelated, haplo-identical donors, etc.) and conditioning regimens (myeloablative, reduced-intensity, low-intensity immunosuppressive conditioning) [4]. For HLA-matched-sibling transplants, a recent randomized study supported the use of ATG-F at a dose of 30 mg/kg [5], whereas both randomized and retrospective studies indicated the use of ATG-T at a dose of approximately 5 mg/kg [6, 7]. For matched-unrelated donor transplants, ATG-F and ATG-T doses are indicated at 60 mg/kg and 4.5\u20137.5 mg/kg, respectively [4, 8\u201310]. Based on consensus opinion, the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group recommends 30 mg/kg of ATG-F or 7.5 mg/kg of ATG-T, divided into three doses administered on days 3, 2, and 1 (for 8/8 HLA allele-matched, unrelated donor transplantation) [4].

The cumulative incidence of relapse mortality was estimated as an event of interest and death with TRM as a competing event. The cumulative incidence method was applied to compute the incidence of GVHD, EBV infection and its subsets, and relapse mortality. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test used for univariate comparison. Risk factors with values of p < 0.05 in univariate analyses were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model to determine their effects on OS. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R software (R version 4.03; The R foundation for Statistical Computing, www.R-project.org). Graphs were made in GraphPad prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).",

The probable cumulative incidences of any grade of aGVHD and cGVHD in our study were higher than those reported by Paiano et al. [17]. We inferred that the differences in HLA consistency in donor/recipient pairs and the free time from immunosuppressants after HSCT were the major reasons for this discrepancy between the two studies. Two-thirds of the enrolled population received HLA-identical or not HLA-matched HSCT; 100% of patients continued immunosuppressive post-transplant therapy, which was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of any grade of aGVHD and cGVHD in Paiano et al.\u2019s study. In our study, all patients underwent haplo-HSCT, and more than half of the patients discontinued all immunosuppressants within 30 days after haplo-HSCT for prophylaxis from relapses or viral infections. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of any grade of cGVHD was higher in the ATG-T group than in the ATG-F group due to the increase of the cumulative incidence of the limited cGVHD. We thought that the duration of immunosuppression achieved by 20 mg/kg of ATG-F is longer than that achieved by 7.5 mg/kg of ATG-T. Fortunately, the limited and controlled cGVHD may improve the graft-versus-leukemia effect and reduce relapse.",

            "text": "Another point of interest in our study was the viral infections, particularly the EBV infection. ATG treatment is considered a risk factor for PTLD development [18, 19]. Before 2000, the mortality rate (84.6%) after HSCT was attributed to PTLDs, the most serious consequence of EBV infections; even in the rituximab era, the mortality due to EBV infection was higher than 72% (95% CI 54\u201396%) in patients with three risk factors for EBV-PTLD [20, 21]. Thus, monitoring and pre-treatment of the EBV infection in the early phase is crucial. However, studies that directly compare different ATG preparations and dosages for the risk of EBV infections are rare. In our study, we compared the incidence of EBV infections and its subsets. The cumulative incidence of EBV infections and EBV-DNAemia tended to be higher in the ATG-T group, with a p value near 0.05. This may imply that the immunosuppression achieved by 7.5 mg/kg ATG-T is more effective than that achieved by 20 mg/kg ATG-F in early phase after HSCT. Our prior study about EBV-CTL reconstitution in haplo-HSCT patients treated with 7.5 mg/kg ATG-T for GVHD prophylaxis also confirmed that the low 30-day level of EBV-CTLs after haplo-HSCT is comparable with that in healthy persons [11]. Low levels of EBV-CTLs are not good for the control of EBV infection. Fortunately, the immunological recovery delay resulted in only a minor increase in EBV-DNAemia but not in EBV-related diseases; the former is easy to control by reducing or tampering the immunosuppression.",

Our observation of relatively higher CD3+ and CD8+ T cell levels was also supported by Alexandersson and colleagues [22]. They noted that the higher CD8+ T cell levels in EBV infections were inferred to the immune response against EBV infections. In line with their findings, in the 27 patients involved in the immune cell recovery analysis in our study, EBV infections appeared in 11/17 patients in the ATG-T group and in 3/10 in the ATG-F group.",

Although the incidence of EBV reactivation was similar in the ATG-T and ATG-F groups, the EBV copy counts of > 104 copies/105 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the occurrence of PTLD were only found in the ATG-T group. Oostenbrink et al.
