Staphylococcus aureus is the most common gram-positive pathogen causing HAP/VAP . Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae could also be encountered, especially in patients with minimal or no recent exposure to antibiotics or the hospital environment [3]. Isolation of certain gram-positive organisms from the blood or sputum samples, such as Viridans group streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., Bacillus spp., should be interpreted with caution as they are rarely implicated in the development of pneumonia. In such cases alternative source/pathogens need to be considered [7]. Table 1 illustrates the list of the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens in neutropenic patients.",

Beta-lactam antibiotics with anti-pseudomonal coverage include cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem with anti-pseudomonal activity such as meropenem or imipenem. Aztreonam can be used as an alternative agent in patients with a documented penicillin allergy. A second anti-pseudomonal agent can be either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone; however, neither of these antibiotics should be used as sole agents. Aminoglycoside monotherapy for the treatment of pneumonia is not recommended due to poor lung penetration and alveolar concentration, prompting higher antibiotic dosing that potentially can lead to nephro- and ototoxicity [1, 27]. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy is discouraged due to the increasing rate of resistance to this particular antibiotic class.

CMV pneumonia is treated with intravenous gancyclovir or foscarnet with a combination of intravenous immunoglobulin or CMV-specific immunoglobulin [18, 31, 32]. Due to the side effect of pancytopenia, ganciclovir is generally contraindicated in the settings of severe neutropenia or a pre-engraftment phase of HSCT [31, 32]. For the treatment of influenza A and B infections, neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir are recommended [31]. RSV pneumonia is typically treated with aerosolized, oral or intravenous ribavirin [31, 33, 34]. Addition of intravenous immunoglobulin may further reduce mortality in this patient population [35]. In high-risk patients with severe human metapneumovirus (hMPV) pneumonia, ribavirin treatment may be used as well but the use of this agent remains controversial [31, 36]. For the treatment of parainfluenza virus (PIV), the use of ribavirin has been described in the literature; albeit without any evidence of reduced mortality [37]. Treatment with interferon Alpha-2b for severe PIV pneumonia may be another promising therapeutic option that needs to be studied further [38].",
