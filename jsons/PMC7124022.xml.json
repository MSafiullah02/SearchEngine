In order to properly recapitulate the complex anatomy of the human lung specialized cell culture models have been developed to resemble both the upper and lower airways [1\u20133]. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) system serve as a universal platform to study human respiratory viruses [4\u20136]. These human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures morphologically and functionally resemble the upper conducting airways in vivo. In these cultures, the epithelial layer is pseudostratified and after differentiation they contain many different cell types such as basal, ciliated, and goblet cells and furthermore, generate protective mucus equivalent to that of in vivo epithelium [7].",

We have adapted and optimized our methods based on previously published work [8\u201310]. Moreover, we have standardized methods for the propagation of human coronaviruses and evaluation of the effects of antiviral compounds on both viral replication and cell viability. We are able to propagate all known human coronaviruses in this system and can easily evaluate their tropism by immunohistochemistry [5, 11]. In this chapter we outline the methods by which we establish fully differentiated airway epithelium and use it for human coronavirus propagation. Additionally, we outline methods for immunofluorescence staining of these cultures for virus detection, characterization of cell tropism and how to perform antiviral assays and quantify viral replication.",

Filter-sterilize the solution through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and store at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots of 3.5 ml in 15 ml tubes. Invert the tube three times before usage.Dissolve 12 mg of Retinoic Acid (RA) in 40 ml absolute EtOH in a 50 ml tube wrapped in aluminum foil, the RA\u2013EtOH stock (1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M) should be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. To prepare the 1,000\u00d7 stock, first confirm the RA concentration of the ethanol stock by diluting it 1:100 in absolute EtOH. Measure the absorbance at 350 nm using a spectrophotometer and a 1 cm light path quartz cuvette (or NanoDrop with 0.1 cm light path), blanked on 100 % EtOH. The absorbance of the diluted stock should equal 0.45 (0.045 on a NanoDrop). RA absorbance readings below 0.18 should be discarded. If the absorbance equals 0.45, add 3 ml of RA\u2013EtOH stock solution to 53 ml PBS and add 4 ml of BSA 150 mg/ml stock. For absorbance values less than 0.45, calculate the needed volume of RA\u2013EtOH stock as 1.35/absorbance and adjust the PBS volume appropriately. The 1,000\u00d7 stock solution should be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots of 1 ml per eppendorf tube.Dissolve 42 mg ferrous sulfate, 12.2 g magnesium chloride, and 1.62 g calcium chloride-dihydrate in 80 ml H2O, add 500 \u03bcl concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). Filter-sterilize the solution through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and store at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots of 1,100 \u03bcl per eppendorf tube.Prepare seven separate 25 or 50 ml stock solutions (see Table 3a and b) in H2O. Filter-sterilize (0.22 \u03bcm) each component after preparation. Afterwards, transfer an aliquot of 50 \u03bcl from each separate component into 49,600 \u03bcl filter-sterilized water (0.22 \u03bcm) and add a volume of 50 \u03bcl concentrated HCl solution. Mix the solution well through gentle vortexing and filter-sterilize the solution through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, and store at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots of 1,100 \u03bcl per eppendorf tube.\nGentamicin and Amphotericin B should be omitted from ALI medium. These antibiotics are only required in BEGM medium right after cell isolation to prevent contamination.For preparation of crystal violet solution safety glasses and protective clothing should be worn. Any spillage must be cleaned with 96 % ethanol.Cells might take longer to dissociate from the bottom of the flask due to the collagen coating. If the cells are not dissociated after 3 min additional rounds of 1-min incubations can be performed until all cells have detached.The seeded primary cells should reach confluence on the inserts within 1 week. If this takes longer the success rate of establishing well differentiated HAE cultures declines exponentially.Human coronavirus NL63, 229E, HKU1, and OC43 are predominantly found in the upper respiratory tract and are therefore incubated at 33 \u00b0C. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are predominantly found in the lower respiratory tract and are therefore incubated at 37 \u00b0C.The fixed HAE cultures can be kept for 1\u20133 months at 4 \u00b0C if the CB is filter-sterilized (0.2 \u03bcM) and all the procedure were performed under sterile conditions. After cold storage it is preferential to acclimatize the fixed cultures for 15 min to room temperature on a gyro-rocker (20\u201330 rpm) prior to continuation of the staining protocol.To prevent bleaching of the fluorophores one should cover the inserts from daylight exposure during each incubation step.Luminometer settings depend on the manufacturer. However, a measurement time of 1\u20132 s per well has proved effective.For this assay cultures must be infected with coronaviruses expressing a Renilla Luciferase reporter gene.If your luminometer is equipped with an injector you must remember to account for priming by increasing the volume of required Renilla Assay buffer by 2\u20133 ml.Primers targeting HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 have been characterized and described [4, 14, 15].\n",
