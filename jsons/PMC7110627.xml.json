However, a global outbreak alert was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) only in March 2003. By July 2003, SARS had spread to about 30 nations, resulting in more than 8000 cases with either atypical pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. When WHO finally declared the end of the global outbreak in July 2003, SARS had already claimed more than 770 lives. In Singapore alone, there were 238 cases with 205 patients who survived, but 33 fatalities, accounting for a mortality rate of approximately 14%.",

Li et al. [11] discovered that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds efficiently to the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV spike protein, thus making it likely to act as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. This is further corroborated by the observation that transfected NIH-3T3 cells expressing ACE2 can be infected with SARS pseudovirus [12]. Furthermore, human monoclonal antibodies against S1 protein block the ACE2 receptor association, and enable potent neutralization of SARS-CoV [10].",

Host\u2013virus interactions involve an elaborate interplay between molecular pathways initiated by the host in response to viral replication, counteracted by mechanisms triggered by the virus to favor its propagation. Insights into the host antiviral strategies as well as viral pathogenesis can be achieved through the elucidation of these host- and virus-mediated transcriptional responses, which may provide clues to disease manifestations caused by the virus.",

Unlike many animal coronaviruses, which infect only cells of their natural host species, SARS-CoV can infect and replicate rapidly in cultured cells of different but related species, such as Vero E6 cells, within a 24-h period [13]. In addition, expression profiles of specific genes, including differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells or MAP-kinase activating death domain (DENN/MADD), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule (FAIM), inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (hIAP1) and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1), were analyzed. We also investigated expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and its alternative splice variant in SARS-CoV-infected cells. These genes play important roles in apoptosis and in host antiviral resistance. Our study can serve as a basis for more detailed investigations into the exact roles of critical genes and pathways in the pathogenesis of this newly emerging lethal infectious disease of humans.",

When cells reached ~90% confluency, one batch of Vero E6 cells that served as the control was mock infected with sterile medium [14], [15]. Another batch was infected with SARS-CoV (2003VA2774 isolated from a SARS patient in Singapore) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 [13], with a virus inoculum volume of 0.75 ml diluted with 1.25 ml of maintenance medium with only 3% fetal calf serum. After adsorption for 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and 20 ml of maintenance medium was added. At 12 h post-infection, cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in infected cells. Following incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h, both uninfected and infected Vero E6 cells were harvested for RNA extraction. This protocol was designed to minimize any effects on gene expression from \u201ccarry-over\u201d cytokines or chemokines in the cell culture supernatant. Moreover, Vero cells are deficient in the interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta response [16]. Viral culture and RNA isolation were carried out in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.",

The majority of signals were of relatively low intensity, which could likely be due to the hybridization of primate cDNAs against a human gene-based microarray. However, a significant number of spots displayed strong intensities, thus facilitating the analysis. The latter spots represent highly conserved primate cDNAs, as evidenced by the sequence homologies of greater than 95% between primate and human cDNAs of most of the genes analyzed. Stringency was exercised by flagging individual spots of poor quality (e.g. extreme unevenness in signals and streaks), which were omitted from Acuity and MIDAS software analyses. Under the statistical analysis program, we initially conducted a low-intensity filtering based on 30% of the standard deviation of the total background intensity following MIDAS software analysis. We selected this criterion as it allowed us to effectively disregard the low-intensity spots while retaining those of sufficient quality to be analyzed. The filtered data were normalized against the Cy3-labeled uninfected Vero E6 cellular cDNAs as the reference by using locally weighted linear regression (LOWESS) analysis, proposed as a method to remove intensity-dependent effects commonly found in log2(ratio) values [24]. We employed log2(ratio) rather than log10(ratio) due to the former\u2019s rationality of treating all regulated genes in a similar fashion, and due to the generation of a continuous spectrum of values. The next step was to regularize the standard deviations of the normalized data to adjust for the variance of the measured log2(ratio) values to be similar throughout the entire array, thereby minimizing the variability of the results. Finally, through SLICE analysis, we defined an intensity-dependent Z-score threshold to be greater than 1.96 (i.e. equivalent to those more than 1.96 standard deviations from the local mean), which permitted us to identify 70 genes that were differentially expressed at the 95% confidence level. Of these, 29 transcripts exhibited an increase, while 41 demonstrated a decrease in expression level greater than fourfold, based on MIDAS analysis. Expression data generated from both the MIDAS and Acuity software were generally in agreement, thus supporting the reliability of the microarray results. Table 2\ngroups the transcripts that were significantly altered at 12 h post-infection according to their known functions, including mRNAs encoding four hypothetical proteins and eight ESTs with unknown roles.",

Only changes in relative expression levels greater than twofold were considered significant. With the HUEL gene serving as a normalization control, the changes in expression and the P-values are listed in Table 2. Our real-time analysis of HUEL gene expression also revealed that the difference in CT between infected and uninfected samples was negligible (less than 0.5), thereby justifying the use of HUEL for normalization (data not shown). Overall, the gene expression trends by real-time RT-PCR concurred with the microarray data for all genes except one, although the magnitude of changes differed. The only discordant gene was MADH2, which mediates TGF-\u03b2 signaling to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Expression of this transcript in infected cells increased by 4.65-fold by microarray analysis, but by only 1.6-fold via real-time RT-PCR. The differences in relative expression by these two techniques may be attributed to their differences in kinetics and sensitivity. In general, relative expression changes by real-time RT-PCR were greater than those by microarray analysis, especially for genes that were markedly overexpressed. This may be explained by the better sensitivity and reliability of real-time RT-PCR compared to microarray, whose drawback is the saturation of fluorescent signals.",

Sequence analysis confirmed that this fragment contained an insertion of 133 nucleotides from intron 9, as previously reported in the MOLT-4 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line [23]. Within this insertion is a premature termination codon upstream of exon 10, which is thus predicted to generate a truncated p53 product lacking the C-terminal amino acids encoded by exons 10 and 11. Compared with the genomic sequence of human p53 gene (GenBank accession no.

How this novel human CoV causes such extensive damage compared with other known human CoVs that are common etiologic agents of relatively mild upper respiratory illness remains to be fully elucidated. Interestingly, animal CoVs generally cause more severe diseases, and the civet cat is currently the prime suspect as the animal source of SARS-CoV that may have crossed the species barrier to humans.

Similar studies have previously been conducted on infections with dengue virus [28], human polyomavirus JC [29] and herpes simplex virus [14]. Vero E6 served as the host cells for infection, as this cell line is the most permissive for SARS-CoV replication [1], [2], [3]. So far, human cell lines are not suitable, with the recent exception of LoVo cells, which are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [30]. However, persistent infection occurs in LoVo cells with no visible CPE, in contrast to the lytic infection seen in Vero E6 cells which mimics the apoptosis observed in the respiratory epithelial cells of severely ill SARS patients [31], [32], [33]. The infection process is very rapid, such that virus particles are internalized into vacuoles within 10 min post-infection [34], extracellular virus particles exist in ~30% of the cells by 6 h post-infection, and numerous large vacuoles containing mature virus are present in the cytoplasm of infected cells from 12 to 21 h post-infection [13], as evident from the almost 105-fold increase in the level of SARS-CoV transcripts by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Expression of the novel SARS-CoV protein 3a is detectable in infected Vero E6 cells at 8\u201312 h post-infection, and also in the pneumocytes of a SARS patient\u2019s lung [35]. Furthermore, the incubation period of SARS is variously reported to be 6.4 days [36] or 5 days [37], with a range of 3\u20138 days [38]. Therefore, 12 h after infection of Vero cells represents an appropriate time-point that allows for a larger population of cells to be infected so that significant changes representative of the pathophysiological process of SARS-CoV infection can be elucidated. It would be ideal to conduct time\u2013course experiments commencing from earlier time-points in the virus replication cycle.",

In view of the relatively small differences between the genomes of humans and primates [42], with most disparities arising from insertions, deletions and rearrangements [43], Vero cells represent a viable alternative model for investigating cellular gene responses to SARS-CoV in lieu of a human cell line. This was further substantiated by sequencing of the genes selected for real-time analyses, which revealed sequence differences of only 1\u20135% (data not shown).",

Such host translational shutoff is frequently observed, as evident in infections with herpes simplex virus [44], influenza virus type A [45] and poliovirus [46]. However, unlike poliovirus infection, which often results in selective translation of viral uncapped mRNAs, CoVs give rise to mRNAs that are structurally similar to their eukaryotic hosts. This allows CoVs to parasitize upon the host machinery to translate the viral mRNA. Another study also indicates that murine CoV at high MOI inhibits host protein synthesis during the very early stage of infection, and suggests that the increased number of viral mRNAs produced during the later phase of infection compete with cellular mRNAs for cellular ribosomes [47].",

CYLN2 is associated with Williams syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder [48]. It mediates the interaction between specific membranous organelles and microtubules, and may be an anti-catastrophic factor [49]. CLASP1 binds CYLN proteins and microtubules, colocalizing at the distal ends to provide stabilizing effects on the microtubules [50]. The microtubule network plays an important role in viral replication and viral protein trafficking [51]. Thus, disrupting the network may initially result in less virus production until a point at which the cells are overwhelmed by virus multiplication and then lyse to release virus particles. By exposing peritoneal macrophages to cytochalasin B, murine CoV infection changes from an acute cytopathology to a persistent type [52]. In SARS-CoV infection, these microtubule networks may become disrupted, making it conducive for persistent viral infection and subsequent release. Besides microtubules, the actin assembly may also be greatly affected by downregulation of TMSB4X and TMSB10, which are actin-sequestering proteins. Indeed, actin mRNAs are reduced in murine CoV infection [47]. Furthermore, reduction of TMSB4X transcripts may disrupt cellular functions, since TMSB4X may have a unique integrative function that links the actin cytoskeleton to important immune and cell growth-signaling cascades [53].",

Noteworthy is the strong induction of HSPA1A which is widely involved in translocation of membrane proteins, and acts as a scavenger of degraded peptides for antigen presentation. During a viral infection, a rise in the level of secreted cytokines such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) is often encountered. Besides inducing the proliferation of T lymphocytes, IL-2 also induces the expression of HSPA1A and HSPCA [54]. In certain inflammatory lung diseases with marked accumulation of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage, free oxygen radicals are produced which induce alveolar macrophages to synthesize antioxidants such as HSPs [55]. Such a phenomenon may operate in the atypical pneumonia characteristic of SARS patients who show significantly elevated plasma levels of IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 [56].",

Suppression of CTSL expression in A549 lung cancer cells leads to growth inhibition, which is compatible with CTSL downregulation during SARS-CoV infection. However, this growth inhibition is partially compensated by upregulation of IL-8 production [58]. In addition, CTSL secreted from human fibroblasts in response to external stimuli plays an important role in the processing of IL-8 to mature form in inflammatory sites [59].",

Increased transcript level of the hIAP1 apoptotic inhibitor [69] during SARS-CoV infection mirrored that observed in dengue virus infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells [28]. Although infected Vero cells eventually lyse at the late phase of infection, hIAP1 may attenuate apoptosis at the early infection phase, thereby allowing the virus to replicate to high titer. In contrast, another anti-apoptotic gene, FAIM, was downregulated in SARS-CoV infection. The susceptibility of primary B cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis is modulated by FAIM [70] and NF\u03baB [71], [72]. Thus, the lower expression of FAIM and the higher expression of NFKBIA which inhibits NF\u03baB are likely to favor Fas-mediated apoptosis. In SARS-CoV infection, the elevated expression of NFKBIA, an inhibitor of the NF\u03baB complex, may attenuate the effect of NF\u03baB [73]. A critical regulator of apoptosis, NF\u03baB is most commonly involved in the suppression of programmed cell death via the transactivation of anti-apoptotic gene expression [74]. NF\u03baB also plays a key role in controlling cell proliferation, as evidenced by the deregulated expression of its constitutively active form in certain cancers such as Hodgkin\u2019s disease [75], [76]. The interplay between, and altered expression of, apoptosis-related genes in SARS-CoV infection may help to achieve viral replication before cell death.",

Various alternatively spliced p53 isoforms are expressed at relatively low levels and tend to be restricted to particular cell types and/or physiologic conditions [79]. The p53 C-terminus plays a pivotal role in regulating the activity of the wild-type molecule. Compared to the regularly spliced form of p53, the C-terminally altered p53 protein inhibits both p53-dependent apoptosis and transactivation [80]; binds more efficiently to DNA in a sequence-specific manner; is more efficient in concentration-dependent transcriptional repression of the promoter of the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene; associates with and interferes more efficiently with binding of TATA-binding protein to a TATA-containing DNA sequence [81]. The presence of this p53 isoform with a truncated C-terminus is therefore expected to modify the activity of the wild-type p53, and exert a role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection.",

The counterbalancing of several anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory pathways together with the variable expression of apoptosis-related genes was striking and instructive [82]. These molecular events underlie the mechanism that ensures cell survival during the early phase of infection to allow rapid multiplication of progeny virus before the CPE occur. Being deficient in IFN response, Vero cells may not necessarily represent physiologically normal cells. Nonetheless, alterations in transcription of genes that are conserved between African green monkeys and humans provide a better understanding of the biology of SARS-CoV infection. Such molecular insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms may lead to novel and viable strategies for intervention in the infection process [83].",
