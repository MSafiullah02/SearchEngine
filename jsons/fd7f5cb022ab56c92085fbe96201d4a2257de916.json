            "text": "Restriction factors are proteins of the innate immune system encoded in the germline genome that inhibit the replication of viruses during their life cycle in host cells. These host proteins are dedicated antiviral factors that are often induced by interferon (IFN) signalling as part of the innate immune response. They are antagonized by viral factors and are rapidly evolving. The term 'restriction factor' was historically adopted by laboratories studying retroviruses following the characterization of the mouse Fv1 locus, which conferred resistance to murine retroviruses 1 . However, this term can also be applied more broadly to host-encoded gene products that inhibit the intracellular replication of any animal virus. Recent work has shown that host susceptibility to viral infection and disease is determined, in part, by the components of the innate immune system (such as restriction factors) and the viral proteins that have evolved to evade or destroy these host defences. In this Review, we describe the general characteristics of restriction factors and show how the evolutionary conflict between viruses and restriction factors has shaped the immune systems of modern-day vertebrates. We use examples of host restriction factors that block primate lentiviruses, although we believe that many of the principles are generally applicable to other viruses and other hosts. These topics are of particular relevance today, as there have been many recent discoveries of restriction factors and determinants of viral susceptibility.",

By contrast, restriction factors are germline-encoded factors that mediate a 'cell-intrinsic' immune response. They are part of the broader innate immune repertoire of cellular molecules that detect and respond to viral infections in the absence of previous exposure. Typically, viral infections are detected by cytoplasmic or membrane-bound pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger an IFN response that induces a programme of expression of IFN-stimulated genes with broad-ranging effects on cell growth and metabolism (reviewed in REFS 2, 3) . Many of these IFNstimulated genes are restriction factors that specifically inhibit viral growth within infected cells. TABLE 1 lists the general features of the restriction factors that target retroviruses and other viruses that are described in this Review. TABLE 1 is not a comprehensive list of restriction factors, but contains some of the best-studied examples.",

However, the exceptions to these definitions are also highlighted in TABLE 1, as they can be enlightening with regard to understanding the additional cellular roles that restriction factors might have. (TABLE 1) , which is consistent with their fundamental role in antiviral responses. The IFN-mediated induction of many restriction factors is also an indication that their major activity is in combating pathogens, rather than some central metabolic or developmental role in the organism. Moreover, as many restriction factors cause destructive events, such as protein modifications or nucleotide mutations, their expression needs to be tightly controlled to avoid deleterious effects on cell growth in the absence of viral challenge. However, IFN-mediated induction is not a universal property of restriction factors, as some are expressed constitutively. In cases in which expression of the protein is constitutive, it is probable that the restriction factor also has a role in restricting endogenous events. For example, in the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, APOBEC3G is constitutively expressed by many cell types, including T cells and germ cells 4, 5 . Although it has a well-characterized role in T cells in the inhibition of retroviruses through the hypermutation of viral genomes during reverse transcription, we suggest that APOBEC3G might have an even more ancient role in protecting the host genome in germ cells from endogenous retrotransposons, which do not induce an IFN response 6 .",

            "text": "During an acute viral infection, each productively infected cell generates many infectious particles, leading to exponential viral growth. Therefore, restriction factors must have extremely potent antiviral activity to have any significant effect on viral loads (the restriction factors included in TABLE 1, for example, decrease viral infectivity by tenfold or more in single-round viral infectivity assays, although the level of restriction observed will vary depending on the system). This antiviral activity can be demonstrated experimentally through overexpression of a restriction factor, which causes a decrease in viral growth, or knockdown of a restriction factor, which causes an increase in viral growth. For example, SAMHD1 (SAM domain-and HD domain-containing protein 1) was recently defined as a restriction factor that is present in monocytes. Decreasing its endogenous expression in monocytes using RNA interference enhanced the replication of HIV-1, and exogenously expressing SAMHD1 in terminally differentiated myeloid cells restricted HIV-1 replication 7, 8 . In addition, the antiviral activity of restriction factors is sometimes specific to families of viruses. For example, TRIM5\u03b1 (tripartite motif-containing protein 5\u03b1) seems to be active only against retroviruses, because it inhibits viral replication by means of a specific interaction with retroviral capsid proteins 9 . By contrast, tetherin (also known as BST2) can restrict enveloped viruses across several virus families, because it is nonspecifically incorporated into the cell and virus membranes and prevents efficient viral release by tethering enveloped viruses to the cell 10 (TABLE 1) . We propose that the major biological activity of restriction factors is to inhibit viral replication. In many cases in which restriction factor function can be examined by gene knockout in mice, ablation of the restriction factor has no untoward effect on mouse development. For example, mice lacking the single mouse Apobec3 gene are viable, and the only reported phenotype is that they are more susceptible to murine retroviruses than are their wild-type counterparts 11 . In fact, natural mutations in Apobec3 and the Mx locus that abolish function exist in some inbred mouse strains 12, 13 . Similarly, mice with natural or engineered mutations in the tetherin, viperin (also known as Rsad2) or interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (Ifitm3) genes are also viable but are more sensitive to some viral infections [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, it is possible that some restriction factors have other cellular roles in addition to viral restriction. For example, TRIM5\u03b1 has a more general role in antiviral signalling in addition to its specific role in retroviral restriction 19, 20 , and mutations in human SAMHD1 are associated with autoimmune disease 21 ",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved antagonists to restriction factors. These viral proteins are often encoded by 'accessory genes' that are not needed for viral replication except in the presence of restriction factors 22 . Restriction factors such as tetherin that inhibit the replication of multiple virus families can be antagonized by diverse viral proteins from the different virus families (TABLE 1 ). In cases in which there is no known viral antagonist to a particular restriction factor, it is possible that the virus can escape restriction through mutation of the viral protein targeted by the restriction factor, as is the case for lentiviral evasion of TRIM5\u03b1-mediated restriction through viral capsid mutations 23, 24 . It is also theoretically possible that a recently evolved restriction factor might not yet have selected for a viral antagonist. However, in most cases, we think that the inability to identify a viral antagonist is more likely to be attributable to the fact that the relevant sets of viruses and host species have yet to be examined. Viral antagonists can overcome restriction factors using several mechanisms. For example, viral antagonists can couple the restriction factor to protein degradation pathways; cause the mislocalization of the restriction factor and thus downregulate functional expression; or function as mimics of the restriction factor substrate (FIG. 1) . To antagonize the restriction factor SAMHD1, the Vpx protein encoded by HIV-2 and related primate lentiviruses targets SAMHD1 for ubiquitylation followed by proteasomal degradation (FIG. 1a) by simultaneously binding to SAMHD1 and an adaptor protein in the cullin 4 ubiquitin ligase complex 7, 8 . The lentiviral Vif protein antagonizes APOBEC3G by a similar mechanism 25, 26 . By contrast, the lentiviral Vpu protein antagonizes the restriction factor tetherin by altering its normal subcellular localization (FIG. 1b) . Through a direct proteinprotein interaction, Vpu sequesters tetherin in the trans-Golgi network and redirects it from the cell membrane to endosomes, where it is unable to restrict viral budding from the cell membrane 27 . A third mechanism of antagonism is illustrated by K3L, a poxvirus-encoded antagonist of the host antiviral RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) pathway. Following recognition of double-stranded RNA, PKR inhibits protein translation by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit-\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). K3L is structurally homologous to eIF2\u03b1 and competes for binding to PKR (FIG. 1c) . By acting as a mimic of eIF2\u03b1, K3L prevents the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and the translational shutoff that the PKR pathway would otherwise induce (reviewed in REF. 28 ). Viruses might also use other strategies that have not yet been characterized to allow viral replication despite the presence of restriction factors.",

            "text": ". Positive selection is often a result of two genetic entities evolving in conflict with one another, as illustrated by the 'Red Queen' hypothesis, which describes an evolutionary system in which continuous adaptation is required to maintain the status quo 29 . Virus-host interactions are examples of 'Red Queen' competition, as host restriction factors exert a selective pressure on virus replication and pathogenic viruses exert fitness costs on their hosts. Mutations that allow a restriction factor to evade a viral antagonist provide a means for the host to escape the fitness costs conferred by the virus. This imposes a selective pressure on the viral antagonist to evolve specificity for the new restriction factor encoded by the host species. As a result, a prey-predator-like 'arms race' dynamic is established, leading to the rapid evolution of both the host and the virus (FIG. 2a) . Thus, nearly all of the restriction factors described in TABLE 1 contain genetic 'signatures' of positive selection. Because viruses have existed throughout vertebrate evolution, the arms race between hosts and viruses is ancient 30 . In fact, many host restriction factors have evolved under positive selection for many millions of years. Under a long-term or recurrent viral selection pressure, a single amino acid in a restriction factor that directly interacts with a viral antagonist may repeatedly be mutated many times during evolution, or a restriction factor may accumulate mutations at multiple residues to escape from antagonism by many different viruses. This leads to an unusually high ratio of the non-synonymous mutation rate (dN) to the synonymous mutation rate (dS) -dN/dS -at single residues and across entire proteins (FIG. 2b) . To estimate the dN/dS ratio of a gene, ancestral gene sequences can be reconstructed using orthologous gene sequences from modern-day species that diverged millions of years ago, and statistical methods are used to calculate the rate of evolution across a phylogenetic tree 31 . This method has shown that many human restriction factors have been evolving under episodic positive selection throughout primate evolution (TABLE 1) . Other methods in addition to the calculation of dN/dS can also be used to identify positive selection across different timescales 32 , and additional background on the relevance and use of measures of positive selection in human evolution can be found in other reviews 33 .",

This was recently suggested for the restriction factor APOBEC3G in African green monkeys 43 , a primate species naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). APOBEC3G is polymorphic in African green monkeys, and some individuals have a single amino acid change that renders APOBEC3G resistant to its viral antagonist, Vif. In an experimental infection of African green monkeys with SIV, the virus from a monkey that was hetero zygous for the Vif-resistant allele of APOBEC3G was unable to evolve the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G, whereas the virus from a monkey that was homozygous for the Vif-resistant allele was quickly able to evolve the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G.

By duplicating a restriction factor, the host can simultaneously explore multiple evolutionary trajectories. For example, in primate, artiodactyl (cloven-hoofed mammalian), canine and feline species, the APOBEC3 repertoires include many more paralogues than in rodents. In these lineages, the ancestral mammalian state -which was a single APOBEC3 gene -has been expanded to a family of APOBEC3 genes [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Most primate genomes now encode seven APOBEC3 gene paralogues, which vary in terms of their antiviral activities and retroelement targets, suggesting that they are adapted to different viruses. Several APOBEC3 genes (including APOBEC3DE, APOBEC3G and APOBEC3H) show evidence of positive selection in primates 45, 49, 50 , but the specific residues that are under positive selection vary between the APOBEC3 genes, further supporting the idea that each paralogue has evolved to target different viruses. In this way, increasing the copy number of a given restriction factor probably gives the host the flexibility to rapidly evolve in response to several different viruses, leading to large families of related restriction factors. Other restriction factor families that are the result of gene duplications include the Mx1 gene family, which comprises two paralogues in some mice 51 ; the IFITM gene family, which comprises at least four paralogues in humans and five paralogues in mice 52 ; and the Trim5 gene family, which comprises eight paralogues in mice and cows and three paralogues in rats 53, 54 .",

The cost of a viral infection must affect the ability of the population to reproduce before it will exert a selective pressure on the population to evolve. During a population-wide infection, some individuals may carry a previously neutral genetic mutation that now confers those individuals with a reproductive advantage in the face of infection, and this advantageous genotype can rapidly rise in frequency until the mutation reaches a frequency of 100% (known as fixation). In a classic selective sweep, surrounding regions of the genome are inherited together (known as hitchhiking) with the genomic sequence that confers the fitness advantage, thus decreasing genetic diversity near the region of the genome under positive selection (reviewed in . Therefore, genomic loci that are under positive selection in a population are predicted to have skewed allele frequencies across long genetic distances surrounding the selected locus. Eventually, if a mutation reaches fixation within a species, between-species comparisons will reveal an excess of non-synonymous mutations in this region relative to the number expected under neutral selection 90 Just as restriction factor families expand when an increase in antiviral activity is advantageous in the presence of viruses, restriction factor families can also contract in the absence of a selective pressure. For example, the restriction factor APOBEC3H from macaques and chimpanzees has potent antiviral activity against lentiviruses 65 . However, two independent loss-of-function mutations in APOBEC3H are present at high frequencies in humans, despite the conservation of antiviral activity in other primates 65 . This suggests that restriction factors such as APOBEC3H, which is a highly active DNA mutator, might impose a cost on the host genome and therefore might be selected against in the absence of the relevant viral pressure.",

APOBEC3DE has rapidly evolved in primates, particularly in the chimpanzee and bonobo lineages 50 . Since its divergence from the human gene, APOBEC3DE in the chimpanzee lineage has accumulated 24 mutations, of which 23 are non-synonymous changes. These changes have broadened the antiviral activity of chimpanzee APOBEC3DE to include the ability to restrict lenti viruses. Human APOBEC3DE, by contrast, has not evolved the ability to restrict lentiviruses. Therefore, by identifying the adaptive consequences of rapid evolution in chimpanzee APOBEC3DE, we suggest that a lentivirus infected the common ancestor of chimpanzees and bonobos in the past; this infection probably occurred approximately 2-5 million years ago, after the chimpanzee-bonobo ancestor diverged from humans. Similarly, the acquisition of a TRIM-CYP fusion gene with antilentiviral functions in owl monkeys 2-6 million years ago strongly argues for such a challenge occurring in this lineage of primates, which is both phylogenetically and geographically distinct from the primates that are known to be infected with lenti viruses currently. By studying the evolution of restriction factors, we can form a more accurate picture of the ancient history of retroviral infections in primates.",

This exerts a fitness cost on the host, and escape mutations will be selected for in the host factor. In return, when the host factor restricts viral replication, a fitness cost is exerted on the virus. Mutations that allow the virus to regain restriction factor antagonism (for example, by re-forming a protein-protein interface between the viral antagonist and the host factor) are selected for in the virus. This back-and-forth fitness adaptation in the virus and host leads to a conflict that is visible on the genetic level. b | Over time, in the absence of genetic conflict, most genes evolve under negative (purifying) selection. This leads to a lower rate of non-synonymous mutations (dN) than of synonymous mutations (dS) in the host gene, and the dN/dS ratio is predicted to be less than one. In the presence of a genetic conflict, such as that caused by a viral antagonist, the host gene will rapidly accumulate non-synonymous mutations, and the dN/dS ratio is predicted to be greater than one. Grey boxes represent synonymous changes, and orange boxes represent non-synonymous changes. selected mutation but would not drive polymorphisms to fixation 71 . For example, simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are considered to be non-pathogenic in their natural hosts 72, 73 . Interestingly, SFVs have co-evolved with their hosts for more than 30 million years 74 , demonstrating that there might not be a selective pressure to stop SFV replication. Furthermore, the rate of evolution of SFVs is many times slower than for other RNA viruses 74 , which suggests that the arms race between virus and host has slowed down considerably in this case.",

Surprisingly, polymorphisms in the African green monkey APOBEC3G gene that allow evasion from antagonism by host-specific SIV Vif proteins were found in the grivet and sabaeus subspecies 43 , suggesting a recent selective pressure on APOBEC3G. Furthermore, the SIV strains that circulate in these subspecies have regained the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G. This suggests that there is an arms race between SIV and African green monkeys that implies some degree of SIV pathogenesis in African green monkeys. For example, SIV might formerly have been pathogenic to African green monkeys, or pathogenesis might be present even now in an unmeasured or mild form. In this manner, the evolution of a host restriction factor and the reciprocal viral evolution can inform our views of viral pathogenesis.",

Without knowing anything about the domains of SAMHD1 that are required for antagonism by the lenti viral protein Vpx, two groups carried out positive selection analyses of SAMHD1 using the dN/dS test and identified two different regions of SAMHD1 that have evolved very rapidly in primates. When functionally tested, these two regions of SAMHD1 were shown to be required for its degradation by Vpx proteins from different lentiviruses in a virus-specific manner. This information has helped to explain how lentiviruses and SAMHD1 have evolved on a molecular level.

An ideal inhibitor of a viral antagonist would specifically disrupt the ability of the antagonist to bind to the host restriction factor or to other host machinery required for restriction. This would enable a host restriction factor to specifically inhibit viral replication, without any effect on the rest of the immune system of an individual. Inhibitors of viral antagonists could be used as therapeutic treatments in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Several inhibitors of HIV-1 Vif have been identified 83, 84 , and attempts have been made at disrupting Vpu function 85 . Achieving inhibition of a viral antagonist without disrupting host functions might be difficult because many viral antagonists use or mimic host machinery for their activity.
