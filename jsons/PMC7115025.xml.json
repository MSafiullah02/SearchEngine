The transborder nature of such disease outbreaks as Ebola, H1N1, H5N1, MERS, has emphasized the critical importance of understanding the complexity and resident vulnerabilities that pervade societies with regards to infectious disease threats. These outbreaks, with their transborder character, have resulted in significant global societal and economic impacts. For example, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 affected the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea highlighting the risks of emerging pathogens on global populations. More than 28,000 Ebola cases were reported from the three countries during the epidemic, and >11,000 persons died. These countries are among the least developed in the world, and their weak infrastructures and underfunded health systems were further compromised by the epidemic.",

Actions and interventions associated with this complex problem space can have highly unpredictable and unintended consequences\u2019 [5]. Helbing [6] argues that we have \u2018\u2026created pathways along which dangerous and damaging events can spread rapidly and globally\u2019. The World Economic Forum Global Risks [7] places the spread of infectious diseases within the top 10 risks in terms of impact.

Woods [9:316] ask the question:How do people detect that problems are emerging or changing when information is subtle, fragmented, incomplete or distributed across different groups \u2026 Many studies have shown how decision makers in evolving situations can get stuck in a single problem frame and miss or misinterpret new information that should force re-evaluation and revision of the situation assessment\u2026 .",

Everyone agrees to the concept because it is the only term used, but they cannot agree to its definition, as it is used differently with different interpretations when it is used. For example, a group of people can look at a painting on a wall, agree that it is a painting, further agree that it is a watercolor and not an oil, but might argue vehemently as to whether it was art or not. Innovation, in the vernacular, is the same thing, something that like beauty is in the eye of the beholder.",

            "text": "The Innovation Group at Dell, Inc. developed a set of set of attributes of innovations to address this issue and were useful in making management and investment decisions around potential innovative projects. These are:Innovation and invention are different. Invention is the process of taking capital1 and creating knowledge. Innovation is the process of taking that knowledge and turning it back into capital by developing a value proposition for stakeholders2 using that new knowledge.Innovations are new ideas as explained in Everett Rogers\u2019 Diffusion of Innovations [25] and defined as a \u201cnew idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method\u201d,3 to which the idea of a value proposition is added. An innovation does not have to be a completely new idea but can be an old idea applied in a new way or in a new area. For example, using lessons learned and principles developed in manufacturing and applying them to healthcare.An innovation is generally forward thinking, addressing opportunities or problems not yet fully formed or expected in the future. They often surface unrecognized needs or wants. Addressing existing problems in traditional ways, or using Cynefin terminology, addressing simple (with knowns) or complicated (with known unknowns) systems, is the domain of Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, and other analytic approaches. Innovation applies in potentially changing or replacing those types of systems but is more commonly applied in complex environment (unknown unknowns as a system \u201cprobe\u201d) or chaotic environments (unknowable as an action).An innovation must be feasible, that is it can be made manifest. For example, when the TV series Star Trek4 was first aired in 1966 it exhibited two \u201cinnovations\u201d, the communicator and the transporter. While farfetched in 1966, the communicator was feasible and today most of us carry one around. In fact, Capt. Kirk was limited to using his to ask Scotty to \u201cbeam me up\u201d, Spock to inquire on the ships computer, Sulu as to where were the Klingons, and McCoy if the red shirt died yet. Our communicators not only allow us to communicate with each other, but have access to the knowledge of humanity, can tell us where we are and how to get to where we want to get to, and a myriad of other things. In fact, we have the entire non-weapons capabilities of the Enterprise in our hands. This is an example of Amara\u2019s Law5 in action. However, no transporters (technically teleporters) exist nor are they likely (baring a fundamental change in the physics of the universe). They transform mass into information and energy to be reconstructed as mass somewhere else. Einstein\u2019s famous equation E=mc2 suggests this is not very feasible. The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in WWII only converted seven tenths of a gram (less than a dollar bill) of material into energy. Imagine what converting a 90,718.5-gram person (200 lbs) to energy would be like?An innovation must be viable. In the computer industry there is this concept of SMOP (Small Matter of Programming), which is short hand for many things can be done once if you put in the effort. But once is not viable or sustainable, you must be able to deliver an innovation with repeatability, reliability, and regularly. If you cannot consistently deliver your innovation and its value proposition to its stakeholders, then it really isn\u2019t an innovation but a special event (or one off). As part of viability/ sustainability is that the value delivered by the innovation must eventually exceed the resources consumed in its creation and other potential uses of those resources (opportunity costs).An innovation must be valuable, and it is surprising how often this is missed. Someone or something somewhere must be informed and willing to surrender resources in order to acquire the benefits (value) of the innovation. This was often ignored in the dot com era of the late 1990s, the financial crisis (lack of transparency and information in the \u201cinnovative\u201d new financial instruments),",

There are five key elements to leading innovation activities:Shaping Context. The role of an innovation leader is not to tell people what to do or how to do it. Instead it is to communicate the desired outcome such as making a wicked problem less troublesome or making the \u201cvictims\u201d of a wicked problem a little better. It is also important that the leader establish the limits on the inputs and processes, the constraints on the innovation around its characteristics (new, forward thinking, feasible, viable, and valuable) so that the innovators may measure their progress. It is not only telling the innovators, but demonstrating it to them with the leasers own decisions and actions.Actively participating. Innovation is not a steering committee exercise. The innovation leader is one of the innovators actively engaged in the innovation process and work with the team.Engaged review. Innovation reviews should never be status dumps. They should be truly informative and engage debates on issues, opportunities to improve, changes in constraints, etc., involving the leader and an innovation team peer.Process breaking. A typical managerial role is to enforce process, standards and limit variability. An innovation leader\u2019s role is the exact opposite. Seeking innovation is a de facto admission that current policy and process is not effective or efficient in addressing the problem or opportunity at hand. However organizations are designed around \u201cmake no mistakes\u201d, have no excess capacity, ensure conformance and other dictums that are the antithesis of innovation. The role of the leader is to cut through all those \u201cgood for production efficiency and risk reduction\u201d rules, policy and process to enable incurring risk, increasing variability, and facilitate learning failure.Being available. Innovation and addressing wicked problems is an ego bruising, if not busting, exercise in ongoing futility, with success around some distant corner. The leader must motivate the team through this (see next section) but importantly, must be always available to help the team celebrate success, deal with failure, and recognize and appreciate the difference.",

These are those which \u201cmight happen\u201d no matter how ridiculous, unlikely or outside of the box of normal ideas or expectations. These are generally reliant on the existence of some future knowledge or capability do not yet possess and not sure where it might come from (but we can imagine it) in order to come about. Possible futures are imaginative.Plausible futures. These could happen. They do not rely upon knowledge or capabilities that do not yet exist, or if they do, there is a reasonably clear path on how that knowledge or capability might emerge. Care needs to be taken here as this is determined by our current understanding of physical laws, processes, causation, systems of human interaction, regulation, and other areas where we may not be fully informed. Because of this, plausible futures should be researched to confirm or expand our understanding of the current state of knowledge and capabilities. These are a subset of the possible futures.Probable futures. These are fundamentally continuations of current trends, a business as usual linear extension of the present, and are therefore considered likely to happen. These are usually the extent of most strategic planners\u2019 considerations. This is dangerous as few trends are continuous over long periods of time, and they made fade away suddenly or be usurped suddenly by a new one unexpectedly (unless identified in a possible or plausible future). Simply reading trends, which is what many marketeers and strategist do, is not foresight. The resulting probable futures is a much smaller subset of possible futures that may impact the enterprise and its stakeholders.Preferable futures. These represent what we want to have happen. While the previous futures are basically cognitively and generally objectively derived, these involve value judgements and are more subjective. This set of futures can intersect any or the above futures and are not part of a continuous subset progression as the others are.Wild card futures. These are low probability futures, or perhaps highly specific futures (reducing their probability for all of the complexity and chaos reasons discussed earlier) but have an additional characteristic that should they occur they would have a very significant outsized impact on our enterprise and/or its stakeholders. These futures are sometimes referred to as black swan events from their description and analysis by Taleb [44] (Fig. 9).",

This is what is most common in business, where it seeks new markets, new challenges, innovation, is highly entrepreneurial, and looks at the future as an ecological competitive space within which one needs to adapt in order to gain advantage. Innovation here tends to focus on products and services, operating models, and organizational models.Progressive foresight. Whereas pragmatic foresight works on innovation among participants within a known ecology or system, progressive foresight looks for ways in which the system or ecology itself can be innovated, transformed and create more value for participants or create new participants. Innovation here looks like what the business press calls \u201cdigital transformation\u201d and creates new ecosystems (online retail) and new participants (Amazon). Innovation here tends to center on management models and business models.Civilizational foresight. This focuses on potential change to multiple ecosystems in an ecosphere. It is called civilizational as it is often looking at preferable futures of a complete society and what can be done to bring one about. In business this tends to happen outside the enterprise with emerging concepts of corporate social responsibility [55], corporate shared value [47], and the rise of new legal structures such as benefit corporations [48] as examples of resulting innovations.",

There is no idealized end state to arrive at, and so approaches to wicked problems should be tractable ways to improve a situation rather than solve it.There is no template to follow when tackling a wicked problem, although history may provide a guide. Teams that approach wicked problems must literally make things up as they go along.There is always more than one explanation for a wicked problem, with the appropriateness of the explanation depending greatly on the individual perspective of the designer.Every wicked problem is a symptom of another problem. The interconnected quality of socio-economic political systems illustrates how, for example, a change in education will cause new behavior in nutrition.No mitigation strategy for a wicked problem has a definitive scientific test because humans invented wicked problems and science exists to understand natural phenomena.Offering a \u201csolution\u201d to a wicked problem frequently is a \u201cone shot\u201d design effort because a significant intervention changes the design space enough to minimize the ability for trial and error.Every wicked problem is unique.Designers attempting to address a wicked problem must be fully responsible for their actions.",

Mental models are important as they are how we reason. From the Princeton Mental Models and Reasoning site:The theory of mental models rests on simple principles, and it extends in a natural way to inferring probabilities, to decision making, and to recursive reasoning about other people\u2019s reasoning. We can summarize the theory in terms of its principal predictions, which have all been corroborated experimentally. According to the model theory, everyday reasoning depends on the simulation of events in mental models (e.g., [65]). The principal assumptions of the theory are:Each model represents a possibility. Its structure corresponds to the structure of the world, but it has symbols for negation, probability, believability, and so on. Models that are kinematic or dynamic unfold in time to represent sequences of events.Models are iconic insofar as possible, that is, their parts and relations correspond to those of the situations that they represent. They underlie visual images, but they also represent abstractions, and so they can represent the extensions of all sorts of relations. They can also be supplemented by symbolic elements to represent, for example, negation.Models explain deduction, induction, and explanation. In a valid deduction, the conclusion holds for all models of the premises. In an induction, knowledge eliminates models of possibilities, and so the conclusion goes beyond the information given. In an abduction, knowledge introduces new concepts in order to yield an explanation.The theory gives a \u2018dual process\u2019 account of reasoning. System 1 constructs initial models of premises and is restricted in computational power, i.e., it cannot carry out recursive inferences. System 2 can follow up the consequences of consequences recursively, and therefore search for counterexamples, where a counterexample is a model of the premises in which the conclusion does not hold.The greater the number of alternative models needed, the harder it is: we take longer and are more likely to err, especially by overlooking a possibility. In the simulation of a sequence of events, the later in the sequence that a critical event occurs, the longer it will take us to make the inference about it.The principle of truth: mental models represent only what is true, and accordingly they predict the occurrence of systematic and compelling fallacies if inferences depend on what is false. An analogous principle applies to the representation of what is possible rather than impossible, to what is permissible rather than impermissible, and to other similar contrasts.The meanings of terms such as \u2018if\u2019 can be modulated by content and knowledge. For example, our geographical knowledge modulates the disjunction: Jay is in Stockholm or he is in Sweden. Unlike most disjunctions, this one yields a definite conclusion: Jay is in Sweden.The theory accounts for the informality of arguments in science and daily life, whereas logic is notoriously of little help in analyzing them.",
