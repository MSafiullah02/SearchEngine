With an increase in the number of infections island-wide and confirmation of early community spread (in patients with no link to previous cases or travel history to China), the Ministry of Health on February 7, 2020, raised the outbreak response to DORSCON Orange status 7 . In coordination with the senior management of the various public hospitals, this triggered a series of outbreak control measures in an attempt to contain the disease spread. Contact tracing measures were ramped up; close contacts of confirmed infections were placed on mandatory 14-day quarantines. Within the health-care setting, healthcare workers with pertinent travel histories to the People's Republic of China were placed on a 2-week mandatory leave of absence and were only allowed to return to work if they remained afebrile and asymptomatic. All health-care staff were issued thermometers for compulsory, twice-daily temperature screening. Inter-hospital cross-deployments ceased with immediate effect 8 . These measures had served Singapore well in disease containment during the previous SARS epidemic in 2003 and have earned early praise from eminent infectious diseases experts 9 .",

However, as part of the larger health-care ecosystem, orthopaedic surgeons also have a crucial role to play in reining in this pandemic.",

This largely pertains to patients with musculoskeletal trauma and tumors. The musculoskeletal trauma and tumor teams have been allowed to continue operating their surgical lists as scheduled. Other elective surgical cases have been postponed to allow hospitals to free up beds for treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. However, there has to be some balance struck between providing continuity of patient care and containing the COVID-19 spread. Day surgical cases (requiring \u00a323 hours of hospital stay) have also been allowed to continue. This largely includes arthroscopies (shoulders, knees, and ankles) and simple day procedures (e.g., soft-tissue surgical procedures and implant removals). These patients with day cases can be discharged expediently (thus reducing their risk for nosocomial COVID-19 infections). Given their relatively short hospital stays, these patients do not pose a major drain on health-care resources. Hospital beds can still be freed up quickly, if required, for emergency admissions.",

This has predominantly affected knee and hip arthroplasty, spinal deformity corrections, and pediatric elective surgical procedures. Patients undergoing these procedures generally require longer hospital stays (3 to 5 days in the local context), which increases their risk of nosocomial infections. As these cases may be more complex, they may contribute an additional burden to limited health-care resources, which are already being stretched thin in dealing with the ongoing epidemic outbreak. For these reasons, non-urgent elective procedures necessitating a stay of >23 hours have been postponed with immediate effect. We recognize that this may have unintended adverse consequences on patient care, particularly in patients with debilitating pain from degenerative joint or spine conditions. Attending physicians have been advised to see these patients early in their outpatient clinics and, where possible, to consider temporizing pain-alleviating measures in their care. This includes intra-articular corticosteroid injections in patients with osteoarthritis or even nerve root blocks (which can be done as a day case) in patients with radicular back pain.",

Arthroplasty surgeons see an older patient demographic group (often with multiple comorbidities), whereas sports surgeons frequently see younger, more active, and healthier patients. This is of relevance given the still relatively indeterminate pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. Recent studies have alluded that older patients with medical comorbidities are more adversely affected by COVID-19 infections owing to their diminished functional reserves and weakened immune systems [10] [11] [12] . In a Lancet publication by Chen et al. 10 , half of patients infected by COVID-19 admitted to the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital had chronic comorbidities (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular disease). Patients with severe symptoms necessitating intensive care treatment were also found to be older with more underlying comorbidities 13 . Conflicting reports have also emerged that attribute the severity of symptoms to cytokine storms in immunocompetent individuals. Patients with severe symptoms admitted to the intensive care unit were found to have significantly elevated plasma cytokine levels (e.g., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFa]) compared with patients with milder symptoms 14 . In light of this, it is thus imperative for us to be cautious and have a high index of suspicion even when seeing younger and healthier patients in the outpatient setting and to not be lulled into complacency and a false sense of security. All patients attending outpatient clinics are screened for risk factors and have their temperature checked with a thermal scanner. Febrile patients with respiratory tract symptoms, especially those with a positive travel or contact history, will be referred to the emergency department for further evaluation to minimize disease spread. All visitors must register via a visitor management system that limits the number of visitors for each patient at any particular time but can also be used for contact tracing if required. The orthopaedic teams have been advised to wear surgical masks for all patient encounters and to follow strict hand hygiene practices.",

With the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, all inter-hospital residency rotations and in-person combined teaching programs have been suspended with immediate effect. With elective surgical procedures cancelled as well, this has ensuing repercussions on orthopaedic training and residents' surgical case logs. Suspending training indefinitely has far-reaching implications and is not sustainable. We have had to think creatively and seek new solutions to maintain quality training, even in these trying times. Teaching programs for residency training can be brought online to various e-learning 21 and videoconferencing 22 platforms. In place of conventional meetings, both faculty and residents can remotely log on to scheduled teaching sessions online using their laptops or handheld devices. This negates the need for in-person contact and minimizes the disruption to teaching schedules and has already commenced at the National University of Singapore and other institutions of higher learning. For procedural specialties such as orthopaedics, the viewing of instructional videos or online webinars can be structured into training programs. This can be followed by faculty-led online discussions to further consolidate resident learning. In addition to domain-specific knowledge and skills, non-cognitive attributes such as teamwork, empathy, courage, and compassion are important qualities that can be demonstrated by every attending physician and can be inculcated in every orthopaedic surgeon in training. During this COVID-19 crisis, orthopaedic residents, together with their counterparts from various other specialties, have been rostered for shifts in the emergency department to assist with the screening of suspected cases. In addition to helping alleviate the manpower crunch in the emergency department, this has provided an opportunity for residents to band, as well as bond, together as a medical community regardless of specialty, to combat this raging viral epidemic. Important lessons in courage, empathy, and teamwork, qualities that are not easily taught through textbooks or even residency rotations, have been learned. Furthermore, this crisis has provided precious lessons for residents in systems-based practice, organization, and leadership. They have learned the importance of rational management of limited resources, to be versatile, and to be able to adapt to an ever-changing, fluid situation. It has also provided an opportunity for residents to revisit their general medical skills (which can sometimes be lost after years of highly specialized orthopaedic training). These are important skill sets for our orthopaedic residents, the health-care leaders of tomorrow.",
