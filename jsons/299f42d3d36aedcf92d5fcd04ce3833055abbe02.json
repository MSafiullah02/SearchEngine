Similarly, the native lymphatics and the neural supply to lung allografts are disrupted at the time of trans-plantation. The impact of these disruptions on lung transplant outcomes remains unclear, though it is possible that these changes lead to higher susceptibility to the development of pulmonary edema and infections, worse airway clearance, and ineffective cough [6] . Lastly, the lung allografts have higher exposure to immunogenic compounds, as compared to other organs, by ventilation. The ongoing exposure to various inhaled injurious agents may also predispose lung allografts to develop chronic rejection.",

The risk factors for the development of pleural complications include previous thoracic surgery, pleural adhesions, and donor-recipient size mismatch [19, 20] . Pleural effusions are extremely common in the early postlung transplant period. The reported incidence has been 100% in some series [19, 20] . All patients have chest tubes in place immediately post-operation to allow lung re-expansion, pleural air, and fluid drainage. The increased amount of pleural fluid post-lung transplantation is related to capillary leak due to allograft ischemia reperfusion, fluid overload, bleeding, and surgical interruption of allograft lymphatics at the time of explantation [19, 20] .",

Risk factors for ACR include the number of HLA mismatches between donor and recipient, although it is unclear which specific HLAs have more impact. Other reported risk factors are age, with older patients having more rejection, immunosuppressive regimen used (tacrolimus regimens reject less), other genetic factors such as IL-10 production, and documented GERD.

Lung transplants have the highest incidence of invasive aspergillosis among solid organ transplant recipients, and it is the most common invasive fungal infection in lung transplant. Aspergillus is ubiquitous in the environment and is acquired by inhalation. There are three main described presentations: invasive pulmonary disease, tracheobronchial aspergillosis, and disseminated disease, all of which are associated with varying degrees of increased mortality. Other implicated molds include Fusarium, Scedosporium, and Mucormycosis. These infections are difficult to treat and are associated with poor clinical outcomes [73] . Candida spp. are another common pathogen in lung transplant setting. Oral candidiasis is the most common manifestation of this infection. However, candida infections can also manifest as candidemia, empyema, surgical wound infection, and disseminated disease. Serious candida infections have been associated with increased mortality, though rates have been declining over time [74] . Other fungal infections in this patient population include opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and Cryptococcus, as well as endemic fungi, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Blastomyces dermatitidis [75, 76] .",

Among noninfectious complications, PGD, VTE, and rejection are the most important ones. CLAD affects most patients long term and remains a significant clinical concern and contributor to early mortality in lung transplant recipients. Lung transplant recipients are also at increased risk for a variety of malignancies, due to their underlying disease, comorbidities, and immunosuppressed status; thus they require vigilant monitoring and screening for cancer. Infectious complications (i.e., bacterial, fungal, viral) are also important contributors to morbidity and mortality, with bacterial pneumonias and CMV most commonly seen. Patients require multidisciplinary and intensive follow-up and aftercare, ongoing vigilance, early recognition and treatment, and open and frequent communication between recipients, caregivers, and healthcare team providers.",
