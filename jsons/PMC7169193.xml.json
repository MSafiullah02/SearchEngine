The disease first emerged in mid November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.\n1\n Once it reached Hong Kong in late February, the disease spread very rapidly to other parts of the world by international air travel.\n1\n The rapidity with which the disease has spread indicated that the causative agent is infectious and virulent. The relatively long incubation period of up to 10 days\n2\n allows the virus to be transported globally by air travellers, many of whom did not show any symptoms of illness prior to their travel. The World Health Organization (WHO) named this atypical pneumonia \u2018Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\u2019 because of its severity.\n3\n The cost to the economy has been estimated to be US$30 billion in the Far East alone.\n4\n The WHO and several governments issued travel advice to hard\u2010hit areas. Hospitals, schools and borders were closed. In addition to the thousands of individuals who contracted the disease and the hundreds who died from it, thousands were quarantined and isolated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome affected every aspect of living for the citizens in hard\u2010hit areas.",

On February 11, the WHO received reports from the Chinese Ministry of Health of an outbreak of 305 cases with five deaths of acute respiratory syndrome in Guangdong, China.\n1\n No further information was provided until March 26, 2003 when China updated its numbers; there were a total of 792 cases and 31 deaths.\n6\n China began daily reporting of SARS cases in early April. By April, the epidemic has spread and reached its peak in Beijing and several parts of China without the central government recognizing the seriousness of the situation. On April 20, China removed the national health minister and the city mayor of Beijing for their poor handling of the SARS crisis and pledged full cooperation with the WHO.\n7\n Control measures including isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, supported by the highest level of government, resulted in a rapid decline of cases in that country. The WHO removed their travel advice and the list of areas with recent local transmission from Beijing on June 24.\n8\n\n",
