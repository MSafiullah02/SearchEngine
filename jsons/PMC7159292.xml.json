In accordance with current WHO guidance,2 Russell and colleagues1 recommend that corticosteroids should not be used in 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury or shock, except in the setting of a clinical trial. The Comment1 contributes to a better understanding of corticosteroid treatment in viral pneumonia. However, as a team of front-line physicians from China, we have a different perspective.",

In clinical settings, physicians tend to use corticosteroids in the most critically ill patients. Therefore, selection bias and confounders in observational studies might contribute to any observed increased mortality in patient groups treated with corticosteroids. Although attempts were made to adjust for confounding factors in the studies, conclusive inference should not be made. Also, we question the interpretation of the systematic review about effective treatments for SARS.3 Clark and colleagues state that \u201cfour studies provided conclusive data, all indicating harm\u201d.1 These four studies were not definitive and only showed evidence of possible harm, whereas the results of 25 other studies were inconclusive, leading the original authors to state that the totality of data are inconclusive, and because of methodological limitations, it was not possible to make any recommendation. Inconclusive clinical evidence should not be a reason for abandoning corticosteroid use in 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",

For example, in a retrospective study of 401 patients with SARS,4 proper use of corticosteroids was found to reduce mortality and shorten the length of stay in hospital for critically ill patients with SARS without causing secondary infection and other complications. Relevant research has also been done for other virus-associated respiratory diseases, such as influenza-associated pneumonia. For example, in a prospective cohort study enrolling 2141 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia from 407 hospitals in China,5 low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids (25\u2013150 mg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) reduced mortality in patients with oxygen index lower than 300 mm Hg. Besides, a systematic review6 suggested corticosteroids could reduce mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.",

We acknowledge the potential risks associated with high-dose corticosteroids in treating 2019-nCoV pneumonia, such as secondary infections, long-term complications, and prolonged virus shedding. However, in critically ill patients, the overwhelming inflammation and cytokine-related lung injury might cause rapidly progressive pneumonia. Given the inconclusive evidence and urgent clinical demand, physicians from the Chinese Thoracic Society have developed an expert consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids in 2019-nCoV pneumonia.7 All members of the expert panel participated in treating patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The expert consensus statement is based both on the available published scientific literature and relevant research by panel members, and it was brought together through e-mail correspondence and online meetings.",
