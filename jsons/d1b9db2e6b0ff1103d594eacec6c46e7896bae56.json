With a high prevalence of diabetes, it is important to understand the special aspects of COVID-19 infection in people with diabetes. This becomes even more important, as most parts of the world are seeing restrictions on mobility of patients in order to contain the pandemic. Recently our group has published an article highlighting special considerations in the management of diabetes in today's times with COVID-19 pandemic [2] . Much more data from various parts of world has accumulated since then about the association between diabetes and COVID-19, management of diabetes in those with COVID-19 infection, and innovative strategies for medical consultation in view of limited access to healthcare facilities for patients with chronic diseases.",

The levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 9% have been linked to a 60% increased risk of hospitalization and pneumonia-related severity during bacterial infection [3] . Past viral pandemics have witnessed the association of diabetes to increased morbidity and mortality. Diabetes was considered as independent risk factor for complications and death during 2002e2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) [4] . Similarly, the presence of diabetes tripled the risk of hospitalization and quadrupled the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission during Influenza A (H1N1) infection outbreak in 2009 [5] . During the 2012 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), diabetes was prevalent in nearly 50% of population and the odds ratio (OR) for severe or critical MERS-CoV ranged from 7.2 to 15.7 in diabetic cohort [6] as compared to overall population. Mortality rate in patients with MERS who had diabetes was 35% [7, 8] .",

In the pooled data from the 10 Chinese studies (n \u00bc 2209) on characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, Singh et al. [9] have reported a prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD in 21%, 11%, and 7% patients, respectively. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 8 trials that included 46,248 COVID-19 patients, Yang et al. [10] reported a prevalence of 17%, 8%, and 5% for hypertension, diabetes and CVD respectively, in patients with COVID-19. Epidemiology Working Group of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that investigated 20, 982 patients of COVID-19 have shown that hypertension, diabetes and CVD were associated in nearly 13%, 5% and 4% of patients respectively [11] . In contrast, an Italian study by Onder et al. found diabetes in nearly 36%, while CVD was associated in nearly 43% of 355 patients admitted with COVID-19 [12] . Similarly, in a small study of 24 patients from United States, Bhatraju et al. [13] reported diabetes to be associated with 58.0% patient with COVID-19. While the study from the COVID-19 surveillance group of Italy (n \u00bc 481) has shown that 34% patients with COVID-19 had diabetes who died, the COVID-19 response team from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA reported a prevalence of 11% from the data of 7162 COVID-19 patients [14, 15] .

            "text": "7. Special aspects of pathophysiology of diabetes and relationship of anti-diabetic drugs in the context of COVID-19 SARS CoV-2, like SARS CoV-1 utilises ACE-2 as receptor for entry into cell [31] . ACE-2 is expressed not only in the type I and II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, but also several other locations like heart, endothelium, renal tubular epithelium, intestinal epithelium, and pancreas. S-glycoprotein on the surface of SARS CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 and causes a conformational change in the S-glycoprotein. This allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases (TMPRSS2 and Furin) ultimately leading to internalization of the virion [32] . Cellular entry of the virus triggers inflammatory response with recruitment of T helper cells which produce interferon g. This leads of recruitment of other inflammatory cells leading to a 'cytokine storm' which could lead to organ damage and multi-organ failure seen in severe disease. As discussed, diabetes is associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19. A study in 161 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan found increased time for viral clearance in patients with diabetes [33] . Apart from the usual mechanisms (impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis) by which diabetes predisposes to infections in general, there are several specific factors responsible for increased risk and severity of infection with SARS CoV2 in diabetes. a) Increased ACE-2 Expression: Diabetic mice have been found to have increased expression of ACE-2 in renal cortex, liver and pancreas, but not in lungs [34] . Recently, a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization study found diabetes to be causally related to ACE-2 expression [35] . Though the significance of these observations is not clear at present, increased ACE-2 expression might predispose people with diabetes to infection with SARS CoV2. b) Increased Furin: Diabetes is associated with an increase in furin, which is a type-1 membrane-bound protease, belonging to the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin family (PCSK). It is involved in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell and increased Furin has been reported in diabetes, which might facilitate viral replication [36] . c) Impaired T-Cell function: Alterations in CD4 lymphocytes have been reported in animal models with MERS [37] . Lymphocytopenia has been observed in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with prognosis [17] . d) Increased Interleukin-6 (IL-6): Several cytokines are increased in COVID-19 infection. Amongst these, IL-6 is increased in diabetes and may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19",

In a median 6.2 years of follow up of 5266 patients with diabetes, Mendy et al.

Experimental studies suggest that pioglitazone reduces steatohepatitis by increasing the ACE-2 expression in liver tissues [46] . This purported increase in ACE-2 expression and its relation to COVID-19 has led some researchers to propose avoiding TZD in patients with diabetes and COVID-19. Experimental studies also suggest that liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist increases the ACE-2 expression in lungs in type 1 diabetic rat and improves right ventricular hypertrophy [47] . Implications of these findings in the current context of COVID-19 and its relation to anti-diabetic drugs is not yet fully clear.",

Interestingly, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I-III cleaves the Angiotensin II (1e8) to Angiotensin III (2e8) and IV (3e8) which has cascading favorable effect through Angiotensin-4 (AT-4) receptors. Similarly, various endo-and oligopeptidase cleaves Angiotensin I (1-10) directly to Angiotensin (1e7) which has a very favorable cascading effect.

Though there is limited data about the association of blood glucose levels with disease course in COVID-19 at present, data from other infections like SARS and influenza H1N1 has shown that patients with poor glycemic control have increased risk of complications and death [60, 61] . Most patients with mild infection and with normal oral intake can continue the usual antihyperglycemic medications. However, it is advisable to discontinue SGLT-2 inhibitors because of the risk of dehydration and euglycemic ketosis. Metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake. Doses of other antihyperglycemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levels.",

Ideally, patients with very poor oral intake or those on mechanical ventilation would require intravenous insulin infusion with frequent monitoring of blood glucose (every hour or every 2 h, see next section). However, the adjustment of infusion rates would necessitate visit to the patient and increase exposure to the medical personnel. There is a need to explore alternate insulin administration strategies. One of these is use of subcutaneous short acting insulin analogues, an approach which has been used successfully in mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis; however, its safety in critically ill patients is less clear [62, 63] . Secondly, single dose of basal insulin has been attempted in critically ill patients as in one study from Thailand. This could be an attractive option as it would reduce contact with the patient considerably [64] but needs more research especially in critically sick patients. Finally, insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) could be an option and some models have the advantage of altering the insulin rates remotely via Bluetooth [65] . Fully automated closed-loop glucose control has been tried in critical illness and if feasible, could be useful in treating patients with COVID-19 [66] .",

Blood glucose readings can then be communicated on phone and necessary action taken. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could be of help, especially the systems where the data can be remotely accessed without visiting the patient. Though, there is some evidence of CGM interference with commonly prescribed medications like acetaminophen, atenolol and lisinopril, it has been shown to be useful and reliable in critically ill patients [67, 68] .",

A retrospective analysis showed reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ACE inhibitors [71] . However, a contrary view is that increased expression of ACE-2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with SARS CoV-2. This could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors. However, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis currently. In a retrospective analysis of 112 COVID-19 hospitalised patients with cardiovascular disease in Wuhan, there was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between nonsurvivors and survivors [72] . In view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm, it is reasonable for patients to continue using ACE inhibitors and ARB, as recommended by European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension, European Society of Hypertension and American Heart Association [73e75].",

There are 'lockdowns\" in most places with people confined at home. Opportunities for exercise are limited and regular walks and visits to gyms or swimming pools are not possible. There is also considerable mental stress because of the unpredictability of the disease as well as social immobility. Alterations in the daily routine affect the dietary intake as well. Stress could lead to inappropriate eating. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables could be limited and there may be a tendency to eat packaged foods high in calories, saturated fat and trans-fat. Patients may find it difficult to procure medicines, insulin, needles and glucose strips etc. because of partial or complete lockdowns. The problem becomes more pronounced with elderly who are living alone. All these factors could cause glucose dysregulation and could predispose the patients to complications like infections, hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis and even acute cardiac events. Care should be taken not to vary the calorie intake markedly. Healthy balanced diet with good amount of protein, fiber and limitation of saturated fats is important to maintain a good glycemic control. 2. Exercise should be continued. Home based exercise like cycling, treadmill, stationary jogging and resistance exercise with small weights are beneficial. 3. Regular intake of antidiabetic drugs and insulin is important and should be emphasized. 4. Telemedicine can be very helpful in these times. Patients can consult their physician via telemedicine and appropriate advice about treatment can be given [81] . An article dealing with telemedicine is under publication in the special issue. 5. Care of feet should be emphasized in order to avoid foot related complications. There are telemedicine temperature mats which can screen for inflammation without having to visit the clinic. The patients who show inflammation can then be called to the clinic [82] . 6 . Patients need to be educated about the need to visit the hospital urgently in emergency situations like vomiting, drowsiness, shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness of limbs, altered sensorium etc.",
