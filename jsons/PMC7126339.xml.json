For example, human virus occurrence during low-flow periods suggests a continuous source of sewage contamination to the watershed such as wastewater treatment effluent, exfiltration from failing wastewater infrastructure, or illicit connections of sanitary sewers and/or septic systems (Rutsch et al., 2006). In addition to the continuous sources of human viruses described above, sources during runoff periods include periods of high-flow stress on the sanitary sewage system due to increased flow volumes. These high-flow-induced sources can include sanitary sewer overflows, combined sewer overflows, and leaks in sewage conveyance infrastructure. Bovine virus occurrence during low-flow periods suggests direct cattle access to streams as a continuous source, while overland flow from barnyards, pastures, and manure application, in addition to subsurface drain tiles would be high-flow-induced sources. Watershed transport mechanisms will influence the fate of the aforementioned sources and can determine the resulting survival, occurrence, and magnitude of waterborne pathogens present in surface waters (Ferguson et al., 2003).",

Previous research has begun to address some of these challenges. For example, a diverse group of human and bovine viruses have been detected previously in watersheds with varying land use (Corsi et al., 2014). A study in Michigan sampled nine rivers for enterovirus and rotavirus, providing insight into spatial variability (Jenkins et al., 2005). Another study in California reported on human adenoviruses in urban runoff, emphasizing the influence that specific land cover class can have on pathogen presence in surface waters (Jiang, 2001).",

Flux provided information that was comparable among the watersheds for assessing relative impact to the Great Lakes and identifying areas that could be focused on for management efforts to have the greatest effect. Virus flux was computed as Virus flux = stream-water volume X virus concentration/(sampling duration X drainage area) (genomic copies/km2/h). Stream-water volume was computed by integrating instantaneous discharge values over the period of interest. For low-flow periods, the period of interest was the sampling period. For runoff-event periods, the period of interest began at the initial hydrograph rise, and ended when flow returned to base-flow conditions or when a subsequent runoff-event hydrograph began. When runoff-event periods included more than one sample, a summation of loadings (streamflow volume X concentration) from the individual samples were used to compute the virus flux. Beginning and ending times used for computation of flux, computed streamflow volumes, and resulting virus flux are provided in the supporting information (Table S3). U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System (NWIS) Web Interface URL links to individual sampling locations streamflow data for the current study period are found in the supporting information (Table S4) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2016a).

Considering the relatively large number of human viruses analyzed compared to previous studies, the selection of organisms is not likely to be a reason for the low occurrence of human viruses observed in the current study. Numerous other factors could influence virus prevalence in a watershed and may contribute to differences from previous study results including: the prevalence of viruses in the human population during the study period, virus sources, land cover characteristics, hydrologic condition, season, and differences in sampling and analytical procedures. Given human viruses were present in all eight watersheds monitored, and each had a wide variation in proportion of areas served by municipal and septic systems, it appears all of the aforementioned factors may potentially contribute to the pathogen contamination detected in these samples.",

Human viruses have been detected previously in watersheds dominated by urban and rural land cover (Corsi et al., 2014, Sidhu et al., 2012), but a sufficient number of sampling sites with full seasonal and hydrologic condition coverage were not available to make broader statements on the influence of land cover on human virus prevalence.",

            "text": "The prevalence of human viruses during different hydrologic periods did not indicate differences at individual sampling locations during runoff-event periods as compared to low-flow periods whether considering concentration, occurrence, or flux. On the surface, three sampling locations (River Rouge, Milwaukee River and River Raisin) look to have greater prevalence of human viruses during runoff-event periods than during low-flow periods, and four locations (Clinton, Portage, Manitowoc and Maumee Rivers) look to have greater human virus prevalence during low-flow periods, but none of these results are statistically significant. The relatively small number of samples coupled with the low level of occurrence presents a challenge in determining statistically significant results at individual sampling locations. In further consideration of hydrologic influence, there may be watershed-specific factors that influence virus presence under different hydrologic conditions such as prevalence of viruses in the human population during the time of study (Bosch, 1998), age and condition of potential sources including septic and municipal systems (Sercu et al., 2011), precipitation characteristics (Corsi et al., 2014), snowpack, and the influence of moisture conditions in the soils adjacent to sources over different seasons (John and Rose, 2005). Even with the substantial restoration efforts which have resulted in a reduction of the number of CSOs in the River Rouge watershed in recent decades (Rouge River National Wet Weather Demonstration Project, 2014), data from the current study indicates human sewage contamination still exists during runoff-event periods in the River Rouge. This is consistent with the nature of CSO events and the potential for other infrastructure issues which lead to exfiltration of sewage during increased runoff periods (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004). Conversely, misconnected and failing septic and sanitary systems, upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge, and CSOs have all been identified as sources of human waste to the Clinton River watershed (Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 2011, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 1995). The Clinton River has the highest percentage of wastewater effluent relative to total streamflow discharge of the eight sampling locations monitored (Table 1). Wastewater treatment often does not fully remove human viruses (Fong et al., 2010, Myrmel et al., 2006), so this can be a source of potential human virus contamination that is diluted during runoff-events, consistent with Clinton River results from the current study. An explanation for increased human virus prevalence during runoff-event periods in the River Raisin is less obvious given the rural nature of the watershed, although biosolid application of septic and municipal waste effluent may be one potential contributor (Sidhu and Toze, 2009). Land cover in the River Raisin is dominated by agriculture (67%), and sewage is largely treated by septic systems and small locality treatment systems.",

The largest difference between results from the two studies was the comparatively large human virus occurrence rate of 85% (n = 13) during runoff-event periods in the previous study. Examining the streamflow record at this site, mean streamflow was 29% greater during the previous study than the current study (Supporting Information; Table S8). Additionally, the sewage overflow volume released to the Milwaukee River basin was 73% greater during the previous study period compared to the current study. (Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewage District, 2016). The increased streamflow and sewage overflow volume have the potential to influence the level of human sewage contamination and could be, at least in part, an explanation for greater human virus occurrence in the previous study.",

This result could potentially be explained by four mechanisms: 1) viruses survive longer in cooler winter temperatures (Schijven and Hassanizadeh, 2000), 2) microorganism-damaging ultraviolet radiation penetrates the water less during winter due to reduced photoperiods and the presence of ice cover, and during spring due to greater turbidities from increased flows, 3) the watersheds had greater flow levels during spring than other parts of the year (Table S8), increasing stress on the wastewater conveyance infrastructure and the resulting risk of sewage exfiltration, and 4) organism (adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, etc.) activity and infections within human populations tend to rise and/or peak during the winter and spring seasons (Dey et al., 2013, Rohayem, 2009, Tran et al., 2010). In addition to the four mechanisms above, municipal WWTPs and/or wastewater stabilization lagoons in all studied watersheds have state regulations and/or National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits that ease the disinfection requirement for WWTP effluent during the non-recreational period of October/November\u2013April (Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (2006); Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, 2016, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, 1986)). Results from the current study are consistent with previous research concluding human viruses in rivers were most prevalent during the cold-weather months spanning late fall through spring.

The Clinton River does have some agricultural land cover that could account for this, but the River Rouge consists primarily of urban land cover. It is possible that the bovine rotavirus A detected in urban watersheds originates from the human-bovine reassortant vaccine amplified by bovine rotavirus A primers (Matthijnssens et al., 2010). The vaccine is administered orally and may be present in WWTP effluent and leaking sanitary/septic systems. In an analysis of virus presence as compared to human-specific and ruminant-specific bacteria, bovine rotavirus A does not increase with human-specific bacteria, but does increase with ruminant-specific bacteria. These findings suggest the human-bovine reassortant vaccine is not a substantial contributor to bovine rotavirus A detected in this study.",

In addition, the importance of land use (high compared to low cattle density) with respect to bovine virus prevalence is apparent in each of the different methods of evaluation presented in the present study. The presence of bovine viruses during runoff-event periods and low-flow periods indicates the possibility of different delivery mechanisms from the source to the stream that become influential during the different hydrologic conditions. Presence of bovine viruses during runoff-event periods is likely a result of overland runoff in barnyard and pasture settings as well as runoff from crop land after manure spreading operations. Potential sources of bovine viruses during low-flow periods include instances where cattle have direct access or are located adjacent to the stream, and situations where applied land manure from cattle manure spreading operations can flow to the stream through tile drainage or the shallow groundwater system. These sources and transport mechanisms are consistent with those identified in previous research on livestock-related waterborne pathogens (Crane et al., 1983, Givens et al., 2016, Jamieson et al., 2002, Wilkes et al., 2014).",

This was not only true for the sum of all bovine viruses, but for all bovine viruses with detections. This result is likely influenced by several factors including: prevalence of viruses in the bovine herd population, greater virus survival in cooler winter temperatures, ice cover, shorter photoperiod, winter manure spreading, and increased soil-moisture content, which enhances the efficiency of hydrologic pathways from sources to receiving streams (Bosch et al., 2006, Mawdsley et al., 1995, Stuntebeck et al., 2011, Xagoraraki et al., 2014).

Considering microorganism concentrations can vary substantially during short time periods and different phases of a hydrograph or during low-flow periods (Templar et al., 2016), a technique to characterize concentrations over relevant time periods is necessary to compare results among different hydrologic conditions and watersheds. The flow-compositing technique described herein allowed for determination of mean pathogen concentrations throughout entire runoff-event periods or over extended low-flow periods that included the full light cycle. This type of characterization provided a way to minimize uncertainty in determination of concentrations and flux computations that arise from less intensive sampling techniques (e.g. grab sampling). Using these data, and normalizing by drainage area, provided an equal measure for comparison among watersheds to allow stakeholders proper data to make informed management decisions on the most effective ways to reduce pathogen delivery to receiving water bodies.",
