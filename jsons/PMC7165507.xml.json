            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) pathologically characterized by focal demyelination, neuronal damage, and astrocyte and microglia activation (Sospedra and Martin,2005). Although CD4 T lymphocytes have been established as important players in MS pathogenesis, CD8 T lymphocytes are increasingly recognized as potential contributors to tissue damage (Friese and Fugger,2009; Mars et al.,2010). CD8 T lymphocytes are detected in MS lesions, preferentially in the parenchyma and in greater amount than their CD4 counterparts (Lassmann,2004; Neumann et al.,2002). Detection of oligoclonal expansion of CD8 T lymphocytes in the CNS of MS patients (Babbe et al.,2000; Jacobsen et al.,2002; Junker et al.,2007; Skulina et al.,2004) suggests their local activation. CD8 T lymphocytes with polarized cytolytic granules are observed in close apposition to oligodendrocytes and demyelinated axons (Neumann et al.,2002). Finally, up\u2010regulated expression of major histocompatibility complex Class I (MHC\u2010I) on microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons in MS lesions supports the concept that CNS cells could be recognized and targeted by CD8 T cells (Hoftberger et al.,2004).",

The B7\u2010CD28 family members play key roles in T\u2010cell responses by contributing both co\u2010stimulatory and co\u2010inhibitory signals. Programmed death\u20101 (PD\u20101), also called CD279, belongs to this family and is a crucial co\u2010inhibitory receptor expressed by activated immune cells (Keir et al.,2008). Whilst only small numbers of na\u00efve or resting human T lymphocytes express detectable PD\u20101, a proportion of these cells up\u2010regulate this receptor upon activation (Kinter et al.,2008); however, the mechanisms dictating PD\u20101 acquisition by a fraction of activated T lymphocytes are still poorly understood. PD\u20101 participates in immune dysfunction and anergy of human CD8 T lymphocytes during chronic viral infections (Day et al.,2006; Trautmann et al.,2006; Urbani et al.,2006). The interaction between PD\u20101 and its ligands PD\u2010L1 or PD\u2010L2 inhibits the TCR\u2010mediated antigen receptor signaling including T\u2010cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity (Carter et al.,2002; Freeman et al.,2000; Rodig et al.,2003). Moreover, this interaction provides essential inhibitory signals to the fine balance between appropriate versus detrimental T\u2010cell activation as illustrated by the various autoimmune diseases spontaneously developed by PD\u20101\u2010deficient mice (Nishimura et al.1999,2001). PD\u2010L1 (also known as B7\u2010H1 or CD274) is widely expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and non\u2010immune cells. In contrast, PD\u2010L2 (also called B7\u2010DC or CD273) expression is restricted to macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells (Keir et al.,2008).",

Blockade of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1/2 pathway increased the susceptibility to or disease severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model, in a strain\u2010specific manner (Zhu et al.,2006). Conversely, blocking PD\u20101 led to a more rapid and severe disease characterized by a boosted number of CNS immune infiltrating cells, especially CD8 T cells (Kroner et al.,2009a,b; Salama et al.,2003; Wang et al.,2010). In EAE mice, up\u2010regulated PD\u20101 expression has been observed on infiltrating cells, while PD\u2010L1 was detected on microglia (Magnus et al.,2005; Salama et al.,2003) and astrocytes (Salama et al.,2003). Other murine CNS inflammatory models have illustrated the capacity of CNS cells to express PD\u2010L1 in response to a variety of insults (Lafon et al.,2008; Lipp et al.,2007; Phares et al.,2009).",

We assessed the impact of such expression specifically on human CD8 T\u2010cell functions since all CNS cell types in MS lesions could potentially interact with infiltrating CD8 T cells given their MHC\u2010I expression (Hoftberger et al.,2004). We demonstrate that human CNS cells express low PD\u2010L1 and PD\u2010L2 levels under basal conditions, but inflammatory stimuli up\u2010regulate PD\u2010L1 on these cells. We establish that glial cells can locally modulate CD8 T cell responses via PD\u2010L1 expression. Finally, we show that PD\u2010L1 is highly expressed in MS lesions but that only small numbers of infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes express PD\u20101. Our data suggest that during MS pathogenesis the inflamed CNS attempts to protect itself against active T lymphocytes via the expression of PD\u2010L1, but fails because most infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes lack PD\u20101.",

Adult CNS cells enriched for oligodendrocytes or microglia were either untreated or cytokine stimulated before PD\u2010L1 and PD\u2010L2 detection concomitantly with either CD68 or CD11c (for microglia) or Nogo\u2010A (for oligodendrocytes) labeling.

As a proof of concept we investigated whether PD\u2010L1 provided by human astrocytes influences CD8 T\u2010cell functions. We elected to use this CNS\u2010immune cell interaction paradigm since PD\u20101 engagement by PD\u2010L1 inhibits TCR signaling and that CD8 T lymphocytes recognize, via their TCR, MHC Class I\u2010peptide complexes, which are enhanced on CNS cells during MS pathogenesis (Hoftberger et al.,2004). We specifically knocked down PD\u2010L1 expression by astrocytes using a siRNA approach. Astrocytes treated with PD\u2010L1 specific siRNA (siPDL1) typically reduced by 60% to 70% their PD\u2010L1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4A; left panel: qPCR results) and by 70% to 77% their PD\u2010L1 protein levels compared with control siRNA (siCTL) (Fig. 4A; right panel: FACS data; representative of four astrocyte donors). However, MHC\u2010I expression (Fig. 4A; right panel) by these astrocytes was not affected by such treatment.",

For comparison, PD\u20101 expression acquired by CD8 T cells cultured in the presence of anti\u2010CD3+anti\u2010CD28 is illustrated (Fig. 4B; upper panel one representative donor, lower panel three donors). Typical FACS profiles of CD8 T cells following co\u2010culture with astrocytes are illustrated (Fig. 4C); 40% (23.6% + 16.4%) of CD8 T cells co\u2010cultured with siPDL1\u2010transfected astrocytes proliferated compared with only 29.1% (17.1% + 12.0%) for those co\u2010cultured with siCTL\u2010transfected astrocytes.

MS lesions were characterized using the ORO and hematoxylin scoring as being acute (AQ), containing numerous phagocytic macrophages that have recently engulfed lipid debris, or subacute (SAQ), containing demyelinated areas but demonstrating less recent myelin destruction. Brain sections were stained for PD\u2010L1 and GFAP or appropriate isotype controls. Six to 10 fields (at 630\u00d7, each field covering 0.0625 mm2) per section (three sections from controls and seven sections from MS patients) containing GFAP\u2010positive cells were thoroughly analyzed to determine the percentage of cells positive for PD\u2010L1 and representative fields are illustrated (Fig. 5A\u2013O). Although we observed PD\u2010L1\u2010positive cells in all sections analyzed, the proportion of PD\u2010L1\u2010expressing cells as well as the PD\u2010L1 signal intensity were greatly enhanced in MS lesions compared with control sections (Fig. 5A,F,K). The proportion of GFAP+ cells per surface area varied throughout sections. However, the majority of astrocytes expressed PD\u2010L1 in MS lesions (Fig. 5H,M,P) while few were positive in control tissues (Fig. 5C,P). We also used the Sudan black staining to identify demyelinated versus non\u2010demyelinated area and observed that most PD\u2010L1+ cells were localized in demyelinated or juxtaposed to demyelinated areas. Finally, our quantitative analysis revealed that AQ and SAQ MS sections bore significantly more PD\u2010L1\u2010expressing astrocytes per mm2 than control sections (Fig. 5N) (SAQ or AQ vs. NC: *P < 0.05).",

We next evaluated whether human infiltrating CD8 T cells found in MS lesions express detectable levels of PD\u20101, which would dictate their susceptibility to immunomodulation by PD\u2010L1 and PD\u2010L2 on CNS cells. We stained for CD8 and PD\u20101 (see Fig. 8) on the same postmortem brain tissues previously used (see Table 2) for PD\u2010L1 detection and performed a similar analysis. We employed the same monoclonal clone (NAT) than others have successfully used to detect PD\u20101 in human tissues (Roncador et al.,2007; Wu et al.,2009). As expected, only rare and isolated CD8 T cells were found in the parenchyma of control patients, and few were located perivascularly (Fig. 8B). In contrast, we detected substantially more CD8 T cells per surface area in both AQ and SAQ MS lesions (Fig. 8G,L,Q) (SAQ vs. NC P = 0.14; AQ vs. NC **P < 0.01). The vast majority of CD8 T cells observed in controls was positive for PD\u20101, regardless of localization (Fig. 8A\u2013D). However, in MS lesions only a few CD8 T cells expressed PD\u20101 (Fig. 8F\u2013I,K\u2013N). We quantified more specifically CD8 T cells located in the parenchyma, where these cells could more likely interact with PD\u2010L1 expressing astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, and determine their proportion expressing PD\u20101. Most of the very few CD8 T cells present in the parenchyma of controls were positive for PD\u20101 (between 50% and 100%). In lesions the percentage of CD8 T cells expressing this inhibitory receptor went down to 0%\u201365%, (NC vs. SAQ *P < 0.05 and NC vs. AQ vs. \u03be P< 0.09) (Fig. 8Q). Cells displaying a leukocyte morphology and devoid of CD8 expressed detectable PD\u20101 in the CNS parenchyma and around blood vessels of MS lesions (Fig. 8H,M; pink arrows); an average of 86 PD\u20101+ cells/mm2 in MS lesions were not CD8 T lymphocytes. To identify these cells we performed co\u2010staining for PD\u20101 and CD4 and observed that most infiltrating CD4 T cells in MS lesions expressed PD\u20101 (Fig. 8R\u2013V).",

In addition, we showed that PD\u2010L1 is significantly more expressed in MS brain lesions than in control tissues and that astrocytes and microglia/macrophages are significant and abundant sources of this ligand in MS lesions. In contrast, most infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes found in MS lesions especially in the parenchyma are devoid of PD\u20101.

However, these reports did not assess the impact of local CNS PD\u2010L1 or PD\u2010L2 expression on T\u2010cell functions. Since T lymphocytes can also express PD\u2010L1, especially following their activation (Kinter et al.,2008), it was essential to specifically block the expression of this ligand in CNS cells. Our siRNA approach allowed us to specifically abolish PD\u2010L1 expression on astrocytes which would not have been possible with antibody. Our results demonstrate that CNS cells, especially astrocytes, express functional and sufficient levels of PD\u2010L1 to locally dampen CD8 T cell responses (proliferation, IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF, granzyme B). The boosted immune responses of CD8 T cells we observed upon co\u2010culture on PD\u2010L1 knockdown astrocytes were partial as only a proportion of ex vivo or activated human CD8 T cells bear PD\u20101, the necessary receptor for PD\u2010L1\u2010mediated inhibition (Bengsch et al.,2010; Day et al.,2006; Kinter et al.,2008). Moreover, inflamed astrocytes express a plethora of activating mediators (boosted MHC expression, secreted cytokine, etc) thus, their final impact on T\u2010cell functions will be dictated by the addition of these numerous factors and PD\u2010L1 is one of them.",

PD\u2010L1 expression was increased on astrocytes, but not on active microglia or neurons in mice suffering from entorhinal cortex lesions (Lipp et al.,2007).

In contrast, rabies virus infection up\u2010regulated PD\u2010L1 in infected murine neurons and immortalized human neurons (Lafon et al.,2008).

Similarly, we also observed that up to 5% of microglia in control CNS samples display PD\u2010L1 staining. Thus, a small subset of microglia bear PD\u2010L1 in non\u2010CNS disease patients suggesting that these donors had small and localized CNS insults. We also observed in controls few astrocytes co\u2010stained for PD\u2010L1, except for one section obtained from a donor who died from cardiac arrest (see Table 2, block 6) which had the highest number of astrocytes positive for PD\u2010L1 of the control samples (see Fig. 5). We could speculate that a CNS insult triggered such expression in this particular donor. PD\u2010L1 has been detected in MS patient brain especially in AQ lesions on cells bearing a microglia/macrophage like morphology (Ortler et al.,2008) but quantification or co\u2010staining was not performed in this study.

Less CD8 T cells in the parenchyma of MS lesions expressed detectable PD\u20101 compared with normal controls (see Fig. 8). In contrast, we detected PD\u20101+ cells that were not positive for CD8 in MS lesions illustrating the capacity of other PD\u20101+ cells, some being CD4 T lymphocytes (see Fig. 8) to infiltrate the CNS of MS patients. Activated CD4 and CD8 T cells have been shown to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier under both pathological and normal conditions (Vrethem et al.,1998) albeit in much lower number in normal controls. Thus, the few and scattered CD8 T cells we detected in normal controls were most likely activated T cells expressing PD\u20101. PD\u20101 levels on CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were lower from relapsing compared to remitting MS patients in blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from relapsing\u2010remitting MS (RRMS) patients (Trabattoni et al.,2009). These results suggest that during active MS, when an important number of T lymphocytes infiltrates the CNS due to an impaired blood\u2010brain barrier (Sospedra and Martin,2005), a smaller proportion of these cells expresses PD\u20101. We can also speculate that CNS infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes devoid of PD\u20101 have a functional advantage over their PD\u20101+ counterparts and can locally proliferate since their TCR signalling is not inhibited by local PD\u2010L1. Alternatively, PD\u20101+ T cells could have undergone apoptosis in the MS tissues and thus be less abundant than their PD\u20101 negative counterparts. Indeed, CD8 T\u2010cell clones have been shown to persist over many years in the CNS of MS patients supporting the notion that these cells have locally encountered their cognate antigen and proliferated (Skulina et al.,2004).",

Although in EAE, PD\u20101 was detected in brain (Liang et al.,2003) and spinal cord (Salama et al.,2003) no quantification assessment was provided. PD\u20101 knockout mice demonstrated a greater susceptibility to EAE than their wild\u2010type counterparts (Wang et al.,2010). Moreover, in the absence of PD\u20101, an increased expansion of T lymphocytes in the CNS and an augmented disease severity were observed in transgenic mice overexpressing a myelin gene (Kroner et al.,2009a,b). These mouse models support the hypothesis that PD\u20101\u2010negative T cells have an elevated capacity to proliferate in the CNS during an ongoing demyelinating disease.",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence support the notion that PD\u20101+ CD8 T lymphocytes are not intrinsically incompetent at migrating to the CNS or to other organ attacked by deleterious autoimmune responses. A greater number of HIV\u2010specific CD8 T cells were found to express PD\u20101 in the cerebrospinal fluid compared with their peripheral blood counterparts in HIV patients (Sadagopal et al.,2010). Analysis of most tissues from chronically infected mice with lymphochoriomeningitis virus illustrated that the brain contained the highest levels of PD\u20101 compared with other organs (Blackburn et al.,2010). Similarly, analysis of mice infected with a neurotropic virus (strain JHM of mouse hepatitis virus) established that virus specific CD8 T cells in the CNS bore greater PD\u20101 levels compared with their peripheral counterparts (Phares et al.,2009). Raptopoulou et al. observed that T lymphocytes that have infiltrated the target organ (synovial tissue and fluid) of rheumatoid arthritis patients were enriched in PD\u20101+ cells compared with healthy tissues (Raptopoulou et al.,2010). Thus, PD\u20101+ T lymphocytes could be detected in human CNS and other organs targeted by autoimmune diseases supporting the notion that our results demonstrating the absence of PD\u20101 on most infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes in MS lesions is novel and unique.",

            "text": "In summary, our novel observations revealed the presence of PD\u2010L1 on CNS cells in an inflamed environment in vitro and in MS lesions. We also demonstrate that this molecule has the capacity to modulate CD8 T\u2010cell responses by dampening proliferation and cytokine production. The local expression of PD\u2010L1 by tissue cells has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting T\u2010cell responses in different mouse models. Whilst PD\u2010L1 expression by islet cells protects from detrimental autoimmune CD4 T cell attack in a diabetes model (Keir et al.,2006), PD\u2010L1 expression by nonhematogenous cells diminished viral clearance and organ immunopathology mediated by CD8 T lymphocytes in a chronic infection model (Mueller et al.,2010). Thus, human CNS cells can achieve the same capacity of abrogating T\u2010cell responses. Finally, the lack of PD\u20101 on numerous infiltrating CD8 Tcells suggests that these cells will not receive an inhibitory signal from the PD\u2010L1 expressing CNS cells, astrocytes, or microglia/macrophages. Strategies aimed at boosting PD\u20101 levels on activated autoreactive human T cells could be a new promising therapeutic approach since PD\u2010L1 is already increased in the target organ.",
