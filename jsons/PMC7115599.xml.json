SARS-CoV is a large RNA virus that contains four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, and is the most important vaccine target. The S protein can be divided into putative S1 (residues 17\u2013680) and S2 (residues 727\u20131195) domain by sequence alignment [4]. S1 is presumably a globular domain that binds to ACE-2 through the receptor binding domain (residues 318\u2013510) while S2 domain contains fusion peptide and heptad repeat motifs that mediate membrane fusion [4], [5].",

As previously reported, intranasal or intramuscular inoculation of highly attenuated modified vaccina virus Ankara (MVA) that expressed full-length S protein could induce neutralization antibody production and elicit protective immunity in BALB/c mice [7]. Another report had indicated that recombinant attenuated parainfluenza type 3 vector that expressed S instead of E, M, and N protein could induce neutralizing antibody and provide protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenging, which suggested that S was the only significant protective antigen among all SARS-CoV structure proteins [8]. Moreover, the SARS-CoV S protein fragments: residues 318\u2013510 (receptor-binding domain) [9], residues 485\u2013625 [10], and residues 803\u2013828 that fused with thioredoxin (Trx) or glutathione-S-transferase (GST) [11] were found to induce neutralizing antibody production in immunized animals. These results suggested that the S protein is an excellent vaccine target, since it could induce strong neutralization antibody response and provide protection against virus challenging in immunized animals.",

The highly glycosylated nature of S protein render mammalian cell to be a suitable expression system, since it have the advantage of carrying out complex post-translational modification. However, the recombinant protein expression level of mammalian cell is much lower than other systems, while sufficient protein production is required for vaccine development. Therefore, several different strategies for improving STR2 protein expression in mammalian cells were investigated in this report, including intron addition and the application of exon splicing enhancers.",

On the other hand, the exon splicing enhancers (ESEs) are known to be specific binding sequences for Serine/Arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) that relate to the control of alternative splicing [13]. It has been demonstrated that some SR proteins, after binding to ESE, could assist the exportation of attached mRNA [14], [15] or enhance mRNA translation [16]. Two ESEs, bidirectional splicing enhancer [17] and the ESE of fibronectin EDA exon (EDA ESE) [18], were selected, and analyzed for their influence on STR2 protein expression. Results of the present study can provide an optimal strategy to enhance SARS-CoV S protein expression in mammalian cells and may contribute to the development of SARS-CoV subunit vaccine.",

Total RNA transcripts obtained from the pIS-transfected CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells were 30% higher than that from the pS-transfected CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the intron-dependent STR2 expression in mammalian cells correlated with a higher level of RNA transcript accumulation in vivo. To further investigate the mechanism(s) of how the intron possess the ability to enhance RNA transcript accumulation, we further measured the in vivo RNA stability between the pIS-transfected and pS-transfected CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells. After treating with actinomycin D, the total RNA transcripts were extracted at each specified time to measure RNA decay quantified by real-time RT-PCR analysis. The results indicated that the RNA transcripts obtained from pIS-tranfected CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells as compared to that from pS-tranfected CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells exhibited similar rates for RNA decay (Fig. 4B). These two RNA transcripts exhibited half-lives of \u223c7 h. Furthermore, the difference of the initial appearance time between region I and region II for the intron-containing construct was 28.3 s (41.7 s for region II and 13.4 s for region I) (pIS construct in Fig. 4C). The difference of the initial appearance time between region I and region II for pS construct was 31.3 s (36.2 s for region II and 4.9 s for region I) (Fig. 4C). The corresponding RNA elongation rate, as calculated as the difference of initial appearance time divided by the nucleotide distance (885 nucleotide residues between region I and region II), was 31.3 nucleotide/s for the intron-containing construct and 28.3 nucleotide/s for the intronless construct. Therefore, a higher elongation rate was observed for the intron-containing construct, indicating that a higher RNA elongation rate accounts for, or at least in parts, the increased RNA transcript accumulation for the intron-dependent STR2 protein expression in mammalian cells.",

A 138 bp intron was further added in the 5\u2032-UTR of STR2 to generate pISBS and pISES (Fig. 5A). Expression vectors of pS, pIS, pSBS, pSES, pISBS, and pISES were transfected into CHO/dhFr\u2212 cell and the expression of STR2 proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). The results indicated that BSE or EDA ESE alone was able to enhance STR2 protein expression without the use of intron. The enhancing effect of EDA ESE was 1.5-fold better than BSE as quantified on the relative intensity of \u223c115 kDa protein band (Fig. 5C). However, when either BSE or EDA ESE was coupling with an intron (pISBS and pISES), the STR2 expression levels were slightly lower than pIS (Fig. 5C). Approximately 38% (pISBS) and 27% (pISES) reduction in STR2 expression was observed when compared to the construct only containing the 138 bp intron (pIS) (Fig. 5C).

Since the STR2 protein sequence contains 15 putative N-link glycosylation sites, the increase in STR2 protein molecular weight might result from the addition of N-glycan during post-translational modification processes. In order to biochemically demonstrate the glycosylation pattern of STR2 expressed in CHO cells, peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and Endo H treatment were used for the following investigation. When pIS transfected cell lysate was treated with PNGase F, both \u223c115 and \u223c130 kDa bands were digested into a single \u223c88 kDa band, which represented the predicted unglycosylated molecular weight of STR2 protein (Fig. 7). This indicated that the \u223c115 and \u223c130 kDa proteins were indeed glycoproteins. Additionally, when the pIS transfected cell lysate was digested with Endo H, the \u223c115 kDa band was disappeared while the \u223c130 kDa band remain unaffected (Fig. 7).

This finding consists with a previous report, which stated that the expression of naturally intronless gene, such as c-jun, could be enhanced by intron addition [19]. Intron and its spliced out processes are highly related to every step of RNA metabolism: transcription, poly(A) tail addition, mRNA translocation into cytoplasm, and translation, and intron works to improve each above-mentioned step [12]. We discovered that, no matter it was CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells, Vero E6 cells, or 293 cells, an 138 bp intron from pIRES vector could significantly improve STR2 expression. However, the intensity of intron enhancing effect on STR2 expression was different, 4.1-fold increase of \u223c115 kDa STR2 expression can be observed in CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells, 1.9-fold in Vero E6 cells, and 2.5-fold in 293 cells (Fig. 3C).

The results indicated that the intron-dependent STR2 protein expression in mammalian cells correlated with a higher level of total RNA accumulation as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). The increased RNA levels by the intron-containing construct is not due to the in vivo RNA stability (Fig. 4B) but from the increase of RNA elongation rate (Fig. 4C). Although other mechanisms may also account for the increased RNA transcript by intron addition such as pre-mRNA or mature mRNA stabilization, poly(A) tail addition, nucleocytoplasmic translocation, translation efficiency [12], our present study has demonstrated that the increase of RNA elongation rate accounted for, or at least in parts, the intron-dependent STR2 protein expression in mammalian cells.",

When the position of EDA ESE was changed into the 5\u2032-UTR of STR2 gene, 2.8-fold increase of STR2 expression can be observed (Fig. 6C). The EDA ESE was reported to increase luciferase expression by 3.7-fold through its interaction with SF2/ASF, a shuttling SR protein that capable of recruiting ribosome to mRNA [16]. It was also reported that the shuttling SR proteins, such as SF2/ASF, act as transportation adaptors and assist mRNA exportation into cytoplasm by interacting with TAP/NXF1 protein [15]. Both BSE and EDA ESE were reported to interact with shuttling SR proteins such as 9G8 and SF2/ASF, and the interaction might lead to the observed STR2 protein expression enhancing effect [17], [20]. Better STR2 protein expression enhancing efficiency of EDA ESE (2.6-fold) than BSE (1.7-fold) was observed (Fig. 5C). It is possible that the different enhancing ability of EDA ESE and BSE is due to the different binding preference to different SR proteins, such as 9G8, SF2/ASF, and SC35, of the two sequences.",

Since the presence of BSE in adenovirus E1 A mRNA was found to activate the usage of a weak 3\u2032 splice site [17]. Other ESEs such as drosophila doublesex (dsx) repeat element (dsxRE) was also reported to activate the recognition of a weak, sex-specific 3\u2032-splice site [21].

The majority of mammalian cell expressed STR2 protein has molecular weight around 115 kDa, and the \u223c115 kDa glycoproteins were sensitive to Endo H treatment (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, a minor band represented \u223c130 kDa glycoprotein, which was found to be resistant to Endo H treatment, was also detected in CHO/dhFr\u2212 cells while transient transfection of intron containing construct, indicating a different N-glycan pattern that favor Golgi complex processing (Fig. 7). The main question is why did the major glycosylation form of STR2 protein lie in \u223c115 kDa instead of \u223c130 kDa? One of the possible answers might be the extensive quality control process of nascent protein in ER [22]. Enzyme or chaperones in ER would recognize the properties of non-native protein, such as abnormal exposure of hydrophobic regions, unpaired cysteine residues, and the tendency of aggregation, and result in the ER retention of a given protein[22]. Although the truncated nature of STR2 renders it easily expressed than its full-length counterpart, linking different S protein fragment together might result in the disruption of nature structure or creation of new structures that cannot be approved by ER quality control system.",

It has been reported that lowering the temperature during protein production can increase correct folding and secretion [23]. Furthermore, small molecular chemical chaperons have been discovered, such as glycerol, dimethylsulphoxide and trimethylamine N-oxide [24], [25], which can carry out nonspecific, folding-promoting effect by stabilize native or native-like structure and preventing protein aggregation [22]. It will be quite interesting to know whether those molecules are able to increase glycosylation complexity of STR2 proteins that produced by amplified cell clones. Moreover, culture conditions such as the availability of glucose and glutamine [26], [27], the concentration of ammonia [28], the supply of oxygen [29], and the percentage of serum [30] can also affect the complexity of attached N-linked glycans on produced recombinant proteins. Therefore, optimization of the culture condition for stable CHO cell clones can also be carried out to improve the production of fully glycosylated STR2 proteins.",
