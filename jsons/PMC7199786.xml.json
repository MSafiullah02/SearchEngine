We used GRFT to probe against NiV-F AU1 and NiV-G His6\u00d7 by Western blot, and we observed detection of both proteins (Figure 2A, left panel, well no. 6 NiV-F AU1, well no. 10 NiV-G). To further characterize these interactions, we performed ELISA binding assays by titrating increasing levels of GRFT against the purified glycoproteins, and we observed comparatively greater binding to NiV-G than to NiV-F (Figure 2A, right panel). We then conducted time-of-addition experiments to determine how long after infection could GRFT still inhibit virus replication. We either incubated serial dilutions of GRFT with rNiV-RLuc for 2 hours before infection or added GRFT at 0, 2, 6, or 12 hpi. Although a 2-hour preincubation of GRFT with rNiV-RLuc showed negligible differences in inhibition compared with GRFT treatment at 0 hpi, gradually increasing reporter activity correlated with longer delays before GRFT treatment (Figure 2B, left panel). It is notable, however, that even when GRFT was added 12 hpi, at concentrations of \u2265~40 nM GRFT reporter activity was still reduced compared with untreated control infected cells. Dose-response curves for reporter activity indicated an approximately 5- to 6-fold decrease in potency between 0 and 12 hpi treatments, with GRFT treatments at 2 or 6 hpi showing an intermediate 2- to 3-fold comparative decrease to 0 hpi treatment (Figure 2B, right panel).",

We compared the antiviral activities of GRFT to mGRFT, to a synthetic dimer (2mG), a synthetic trimer (3mG), and a Q-GRFT containing 1 amino acid change (M78\u2192Q), and we found that 3mG was most potent, Q-GRFT was equivalently potent, 2mG was less potent, and that mGRFT had lost all antiviral activity against rNiV-RLuc (Figure 3A, left and right panels, Table 1). To confirm these findings, we tested GRFT, 2mG, 3mG, and Q-GRFT against wild-type NiV-B, NiV-M, and HeV, and we observed similar trends as seen for rNiV-RLuc, with 3mG having the greatest antiviral potency (Figure 3B, Table 1). Among these compounds, only 3mG showed mild cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. We also observed varied antiviral potencies for GRFT and 3mG against other respiratory and hemorrhagic fever viruses of human public health importance, ranging from no activity to potent activity with sub-nanomolar EC50 values (Table 1, Supplementary Figures S2A\u2013D and S3A and B).",

To confirm this result, we developed a quantitative image-based syncytia counting assay. Whereas cells transfected only with NiV-F plasmid had minimal background syncytia counts, cells transfected with both NiV glycoproteins had >1000 syncytia counts (Figure 4B, left panel). Using this assay, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in syncytia counts that correlated with increased levels of GRFT or 3mG, but we noted that 3mG more efficiently reduced syncytia than GRFT at higher concentrations (Figure 4B, right panel). When Vero cells were treated with GRFT or 3mG after infection by either green fluorescent reporter NiV (rNiV-ZsG) or NiV-B, 3mG reduced virus yield more efficiently than GRFT, similarly reflecting their differing abilities to block syncytia formation (Figure 4C, left and right panels, respectively). Accordingly, 3mG visibly delayed or reduced the size of syncytia formation more efficiently than GRFT in rNiV-ZsG infected cells (Figure 4D).",

            "text": "In this study, we characterized the in vitro antiviral activity of GRFT and its 3mG tandemer against NiV and a series of other important human viral pathogens. Similar to in vitro observations for HIV-1, GRFT and 3mG can block both NiV entry and cell-to-cell spread [15, 20]. Although 3mG consistently outperformed GRFT in its ability to block both NiV glycoprotein-induced cell-to-cell fusion and NiV infectious yield, it had comparatively weaker ELISA binding profiles against purified NiV glycoproteins. This observation could be explained by differences in anti-GRFT polyclonal antibody binding to 3mG because it is not an obligate dimer as is wild-type GRFT, against which the polyclonal antibodies were generated. Future biochemical and structural studies should not only identify the N-glycosylation sites on NiV-F and NiV-G that are important for antiviral susceptibility to GRFT/3mG, but also investigate the molecular interactions of GRFT/3mG with NiV-F and NiV-G proteins to determine how these may alter the biophysical properties of a NiV virion. Despite the superior in vitro ability of 3mG to block NiV syncytia formation and virus yield, 3mG protected less than half as many animals as did Q-GRFT from in vivo challenge. This can be attributed to 3mG likely having a shorter in vivo half-life compared with Q-GRFT, which is significantly more resistant to oxidation compared with wild-type GRFT [21]. The 3mG may require re-engineering to achieve better in vivo efficacy, because 3mG contains flexible linkers that are more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage than GRFT [44]. Although all survivors developed significant neutralizing antibodies against NiV, only 1 survivor treated with 3mG tested positive for total anti-NiV IgG (Supplemental Table), suggesting that the majority of NiV-specific antibodies generated in Q-GRFT/3mG-treated survivors target the surface glycoproteins. The GRFT and other lectins represent another avenue towards developing NiV therapeutics. Because NiV glycoprotein glycosylation modulates syncytia formation and shields against neutralizing antibodies [45, 46], retaining these glycosylation sites likely maintains viral fitness. A potential treatment regimen combining GRFT with both monoclonal antibody m102.4 and nucleotide prodrug remdesivir would provide an additional constraint against development of NiV escape mutants.",

(D) Griffithsin and 3mG equivalently block NiV-F- and NiV-G-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication-deficient particles expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Vero cells were treated with 3-fold serial dilutions of GRFT or 3mG for 24 hours (left panel) concurrently with infection or pretreated for 1 hour (right panel) before infection with replication-deficient VSV particles pseudotyped either with VSV-G glycoprotein (VSVpt) or the NiV-F and NiV-G glycoproteins (NiVpt). At 24 hours postinfection, numbers of GFP-positive infected cells were counted and normalized to numbers from untreated infected cells. Reporter rNiV-RLuc assays were performed once in triplicate, CPE assays were performed at least twice in triplicate, ELISAs were performed at least twice in triplicate, and pseudotyped experiments were performed twice in duplicate at each respective concentration of GRFT and 3mG.",

(A) Fusion assay. HT-1080 cells transfected with NiV-F and NiV-G expression plasmids were (1) treated with 3-fold dilutions of either GRFT (top panels) or 3mG (bottom panels) for 16 hours, (2) fixed and stained with CellMask Green (green cytoplasmic stain) and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (colored red for contrast), and (3) observed for syncytia formation. \u201cNo Tx\u201d indicates transfected cells not treated with either GRFT or 3mG. White bars indicate 500 microns. (B) Quantitative image-based syncytia counting assay. Fluorescent micrograph montages (left panel) were created of individual wells of CHO-K1 cells transfected with NiV-F plasmid only or with both NiV-F and NiV-G plasmids, overlaid with bacteriophage T7 polymerase expressing BSRT7/5 cells, with syncytia counts indicated for each respective well. Numbers of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive NiV glycoprotein- induced syncytia are plotted against increasing concentrations of either GRFT (black circles) or 3mG (red squares) (right panel). Adjusted P values for multiple t tests performed to compare numbers of syncytia between GRFT and 3mG-treated cells at each concentration are indicated by single or double asterisks. (C) The 3mG more efficiently reduces infectious virus yield compared with GRFT. Vero cells were infected with either reporter NiV expressing ZsGreen protein (rNiV-ZsG) (left panel) or NiV Bangladesh (NiV-B) (right panel) (multiplicity of infection = 0.25) for 1 hour before being treated with 2-fold serial dilutions of GRFT (black circles) or 3mG (red squares). At 48 hours postinfection, infectious yield was measured using 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay and was plotted against respective compound concentrations.

The Q-GRFT and 3mG Tx control animals were not infected with NiV-B. Asterisks indicate treatment days, whereas rotated question mark indicates day of virus challenge. Animal survival curves were analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test and were significantly different by both tests, with P < .0001.
