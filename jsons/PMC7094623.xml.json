SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped virus with a single strand, positive-sense RNA genome of 29.7 kb in length. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set of nine mRNAs species, including the genome-length mRNA (mRNA1) and eight subgenomic mRNA species (mRNA2\u20139), is expressed. The genome-length mRNA1 encodes two overlapping replicase proteins in the form of polyproteins 1a and 1a/b, which are processed by virus-encoded proteinases into at least 16 putative nonstructural proteins (NSP1\u2013NSP16) [24], [29]. The four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), are encoded by subgenomic mRNA 2, 4, 5, and 9, respectively. In addition, eight putative nonstructural proteins, 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b, are encoded by subgenomic mRNA3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 [24], [29].",

            "text": "All coronaviruses encode an extensively phosphorylated, highly basic protein. It varies from 377 to 455 amino acids in length and has high serine content (7\u201311%), which are potential targets for phosphorylation. Although the primary sequence conservation of the N proteins within the genus is low, three structural domains can be identified based on sequence comparisons [14]. Of which the middle domain is a potential RNA-binding domain, capable of binding both coronavirus- and non-coronavirus-derived RNA sequences in vitro [26]. The functions of domains I and III remain unknown. However, putative motifs for ribosome binding and nucleolar localization signals (NuLs) have been identified in domain III region [31]. In cells expressing the N protein, it localizes either to the cytoplasm alone or to the cytoplasm and nucleolus [9]. This nucleolar localization has been shown to be a common feature of the coronavirus family [31]. Multiple functions have been postulated for the coronavirus N protein throughout the virus life cycle. Primarily, the protein can be associated with the genomic RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) and viral core [5], [7], [19], [20]. It plays an important role in the replication of the genomic RNA [3], and in the transcription and translation of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) [1], [26], [28]. In addition, N protein might inhibit host cell proliferation or delay cell growth, possibly by disrupting cytokinesis [4], [31]. The protein is generally phosphorylated at multiple positions and is one of the most abundant structural proteins [14]. It can also stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune response, making it a potential vaccine candidate [12].",

In Escherichia coli BL21 cells, the protein was expressed as a single protein species. However, multiple protein bands with a wide range of molecular masses were detected when the N protein was expressed in mammalian cells, indicating that it may have undergone posttranslational modification in addition to phosphorylation and may form homo-oligomers. Biochemical characterization and mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the protein was posttranslationally modified by covalent attachment to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). The sumoylation site was mapped to the 62lysine residue of the N protein. Further expression and characterization of wild type N protein and K62A mutant revealed that sumoylation drastically promotes homo-oligomerization of the protein. Sumoylation of the N protein may also play certain roles in its interference of host cell division. As self-association and homo-oligomerization of the N protein are essential for the formation of viral RNP and nucleocapsid assembly, sumoylation of this protein may play an important regulatory role in the SARS-CoV replication cycles.",

            "text": "The detection of multiple protein species with a wide range of molecular masses when the N protein was expressed in mammalian cells indicates that the protein may undergo other posttranslational modification, in addition to the known phosphorylation. As N protein does not contain any cysteine residue, the detection of potential oligomers suggests that it may form higher-order structures through other interactions. Sumoylation is one of the posttranslational modifications that affect the migration of the protein. To detect if the N protein is modified by sumoylation, cells transfected with pFlag-N were lysed either with a lysis buffer containing two isopeptidase inhibitors, iodoacetamide (IAA, 10 mM) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 20 mM), or with the Laemmli protein gel loading buffer preheated to 80 \u00b0C, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Flag antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 2\nA, in addition to the three major isoforms of N protein that were detected under all conditions, a protein species of approximately 65 kDa was detected in cell lysates prepared with lysis buffer containing IAA and NEM (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 3, and 5). Occasionally, a band of approximately 55 kDa was also detected in cell lysates prepared with buffer containing IAA and NEM (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Co-expression of N protein with SUMO-1 led to the detection of significant more 65 kDa species (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). The 65-kDa band was also detected when cells were lysed directly with preheated SDS loading buffer (Fig. 2A, lane 6). During the course of this study, we noted that the 65-kDa band could also be efficiently detected under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, the three major isoforms and the 65-kDa band are migrating at the same positions. This would allow detection of N proteins in the subsequent co-immunoprecipitation experiments using SDS\u2013PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The reason for choosing the non-reducing conditions in these assays is that the IgG heavy chain would mask the detection of the three major N isoforms under reducing conditions.",

One lysine residue at amino acid position 62, K62, lies roughly within the consensus SUMO-1 modification sequence (GKEE) (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this lysine was responsible for the modification of N protein by sumoylation, it was mutated to an Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Proteins extracted from cells transfected with wild-type N and K62A mutant were immunoblotted with anti-Flag antibody. As shown in Fig. 3\n, similar amounts of the three isoforms of N protein were detected from cells transfected with either wild type or mutant N constructs (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2).

To quantitate the multinucleated cells, HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-N, pEGFP-N + SUMO-1, and pEGFP-N(K62A) + SUMO-1 were examined under the fluorescence microscope at 24, 36, 48 and 60 h posttransfection, respectively, and the multinucleated cells were counted among 300 cells expressing GFP.

The percentages of cells undergoing cell division increased to 31\u201336% among GFP-positive cells when pEGFP-N were co-expressed with SUMO-1. However, the percentages of cells undergoing cell division were markedly reduced to 11\u201315% in cells overexpressing the K62A mutant and SUMO-1 (Fig. 8), significantly less than (P\n < 0.05) the multinucleated cells observed when the wild type construct was expressed.

Conjugation of SUMO to a protein involves the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and the \u03b5-amino group of lysine residue in the target protein. Although SUMO-1 has an estimated molecular mass of approximately 12 kDa, earlier studies demonstrated that many SUMO-conjugated proteins usually have a size increase of approximately 20 kDa after conjugation by one SUMO-1 molecule. SUMO conjugated proteins are typically unstable and can be rapidly hydrolyzed by SUMO-1 hydrolase during purification. This modification usually alters or regulates the main function of the target proteins.",

            "text": "Coronavirus N protein is a multi-functional protein [14], [31]. Among them, the most prominent function of the protein is to wrap up the RNA genome to form RNP and assemble into the nucleocapsid core, due to its RNA-binding activities and self-association properties. Studies with other coronavirus N protein have mapped the RNA binding domain to the N-terminal one third region of the protein [14]. A basic amino acid stretch between amino acids 238 and 293 may be responsible for the RNA binding activities of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus N protein [34]. Interactions between N protein and RNA are generally required for encapsidation of viral genomic RNA. It is possible that RNA could promote N\u2013N interactions by neutralizing charge repulsions between the two stretches of basic amino acids. As the K62 residue is located in the putative RNA-binding domain of the SARS-CoV N protein, is the reduced homo-oligomerization of the K62A mutant reported in this study due to its loss of the RNA binding activity? Although we do not know if this mutation could affect the RNA-binding activities of the protein, co-expression of the Flag-tagged K62A mutant with the Myc-tagged wild type N protein resulted in the detection of remarkably less 85-kDa dimers than in cells co-expressing the Flag- and Myc-tagged wild type N protein. As two different antibodies were used in the immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, it virtually rules out the possibility that the detection of less 85- and 175-kDa oligomers in Western blot studies involving a single antibody is due to a weaker RNA binding activity of the mutant construct.",

            "text": "Self-association and homo-oligomerization are another essential property of the coronavirus N protein. Two recent studies have shown that the S/R-rich motif and the C-terminal 209 amino acids are essential for self-association and multimerization of the SARS-CoV N protein [8], [27]. The findings in this report indicate that the N protein is capable of forming dimers and higher order multimers. Similar to the equivalent protein of equine arteritis virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus, SARS N protein does not contain any cysteine in its 422 amino acid residues. This excludes the possibility that disulfide bonds are the primary force that mediates the initial N\u2013N interactions. In fact, disulfide bonds do not appear to be relevant until the virus enters the secretory pathway (ER and Golgi) and/or egresses from the cell, both events occurred following the core particle assembly. Data reported in this study demonstrate that sumoylation of the SARS-CoV N protein dramatically enhances the homo-oligomerization of the protein. Promotion of oligomerization of protein by sumoylation has been speculated for a pathogenic protein, Huntingtin [25]. Since self-association and homo-oligomerization of N protein are essential for the assembly of nucleocapsid core, it suggests that sumoylation would play an important role in the SARS-CoV replication cycles. Systematic testing this possibility would rely on the availability of an infectious cloning system, as developed by Yount et al. [33].",

The failure to detect the sumoylated dimer in this study is unexpected, considering that sumoylation was shown to promote dimerization of the N protein. Two possibilities have been considered. First, sumoylation is a highly reversible process. The current data showed that only a small proportion of the N protein was dimerized compared to the monomers, and a certain proportion of the sumoylated dimer may be reversed during sample preparation and detection. The combination of these two factors would hamper the detection of the sumoylated dimers by the approaches used. The second possibility is that the sumoylated N protein may be not directly involved in the formation of dimers and other oligomers. Instead, it may target the N protein to different cellular compartments and facilitate the oligomerization of the N protein. Further studies are required to address these possibilities.",

We do not know if other minor sumoylation sites may exist in the SARS-CoV N protein. Potential sumoylation at these minor positions would compensate the effect of K62A mutation, and complicate the interpretation of the data generating from functional studies, such as the partial interference of cell division by the K62A mutant N protein. Sumoylation of protein at multiple sites was recently reported for several viral and host proteins. For example, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus Rta protein was shown to be sumoylated at three alternating sites [2]. As the SARS-CoV N protein contains a total of 27 lysine residues and no any other lysine residue is located in a consensus sequence context for sumoylation, it would be difficult to further define these sites, if any, by a conventional mutagenesis approach.",

However, the functional significance and the mechanism by which the N protein translocates to the nucleolus are yet to be determined. Systematic investigation of NuLS of the SARS-CoV N protein that might target it to the nucleolus will be carried out based on sequence comparison with other coronaviruses. An alternative possibility that may account for the nucleolar localization of a viral protein is its interaction with certain nucleolar antigens such as fibrillarin and nucleolin. This was demonstrated on IBV and MHV N proteins [4]. Sumoylation of certain host proteins can regulate their nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling [22], [32]. The K62A mutant exhibits much less nucleolus localization, indicating that sumoylation may regulate the subcellular localization of the SARS-C-V N protein.",
