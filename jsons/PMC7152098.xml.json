Stress can be minimized by examining the rabbit in a quiet room and moving slowly. Rabbits are a prey species and thereby very sensitive to external stimuli. If necessary, sedatives may also be given to minimize the risk of self-injury. Sedation can be achieved with midazolam 0.5 to 1 mg/kg intramuscularly45 or, for heavier sedation, a combination of ketamine 5 to 20 mg/kg and midazolam 1 to 2 mg/kg subcutaneously13 with minimal cardiovascular depression (see Chapters 31 and AppendixChapter 31Appendix). Provide flow-by oxygen as needed if a rabbit is dyspneic or becomes tachypneic with handling. In rabbits suspected of having cardiac disease or respiratory distress, focus the initial examination on observing the respiratory rate and pattern, obtaining the heart rate and rhythm, auscultating the thorax, examining the mucous membranes, and palpating the pulses. Normal heart rate is 180 to 250 beats per minute and normal respiratory rate is 30 to 60 breaths per minute. Peripheral pulses can be palpated at the central artery of the ear and should be strong and synchronous with the heartbeat. Two heart sounds (S1 and S2) are normally heard. Rabbits are obligate nose breathers; therefore do not occlude the nares.",

Systematic auscultation of the thorax is the most important part of the cardiac examination. The entire thorax should be auscultated to localize heart murmurs and detect extra heart sounds (gallop sounds), arrhythmias, and abnormal lung sounds. A pediatric stethoscope allows better localization of heart sounds in rabbits and is preferred for cardiac auscultation; a larger-diaphragm stethoscope enhances auscultation of the lungs. Auscultatory findings vary among rabbits with congestive heart failure, and these findings are not pathognomonic.

However, in rabbits that are tachypneic or dyspneic, give oxygen by face mask during restraint. The echocardiographic exam may be performed in lateral or sternal recumbency. Standard views used to evaluate dogs and cats can also be obtained with the rabbit. Because of the rabbit\u2019s rapid heart rate and small size, optimal evaluation requires a high-frequency transducer and high-frame-rate ultrasound machine. Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography assess cardiac structure, chamber size, wall thickness, and motion as well as extracardiac structures, masses, and pleural effusion. Color-flow, spectral, and tissue Doppler echocardiography assess direction and velocity of blood flow, further defining cardiac conditions with more insight on systolic and diastolic function. Normal echocardiographic values have been published for several breeds of rabbits (Table 20-2\n). Sedative drugs used for restraint may affect cardiac measurements, especially alpha2-agonists such as dexmedetomidine and xylazine. Reduced percent fractional shortening, E/A reversal, decreased heart rate, and other changes have been documented with intramuscular ketamine at dose of 50 mg/kg and xylazine at 4 mg/kg.54 Sedation with ketamine 20 mg/kg and midazolam 2 mg/kg given subcutaneously has been shown to be less cardiodepressive.13\n",

In another report, three domestic rabbits were diagnosed with cutaneous lymphoma.65 Two rabbits were young (7 months and 1 year) and the third was 9 years old. One young rabbit had erythematous alopecia and hemorrhagic crusts of the chin and ventral neck. At necropsy, neoplastic lymphocytes were found in the skin, lymph nodes, and lungs. In skin sections, the lymphocytes infiltrated the entire dermis and into the epidermis. The second rabbit had bilateral blepharitis that was unresponsive to treatment. At necropsy, superficial and deep lymph nodes were markedly enlarged, and lungs had reddened areas. Lymphocytic infiltrates were found in the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. In the skin sections, lymphoid infiltrates were primarily in the subcutis and deep dermis. The third rabbit had nonpruritic alopecia of the left lateral thorax. Cutaneous lymphoma was diagnosed by biopsy of a skin sample; in this rabbit, lymphocytes infiltrated the superficial dermis and epidermis. The rabbit lived for an additional year after diagnosis, with no response to treatment with interferon alpha-2b (see \u201cTreatment,\u201d below). A necropsy was not performed. In all three rabbits, immunologic staining of tissue sections confirmed the lymphoma to be of T-cell origin. In a large retrospective study of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits over 16 years, the authors reported a single case of lymphoma in the flank of a 4-year-old female rabbit. In this case, epitheliotropism was not noted.62\n",

Thymic lymphoma denotes that the neoplasm is of T-lymphocytic origin, possibly with other organ and systemic involvement. In some cases the lymphoid cells are small mature cells; in others, lymphocytes are pleomorphic with prominent nucleoli. Thymic lymphomas are unique because they reflect the function of the thymus gland as an organ involved in two-cell generation and differentiation. Diagnosis is made from cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirates or histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Clinically and cytologically, distinguishing thymoma from thymic lymphoma can be difficult. Tissue samples are often needed, since these tumors are classified based on the cells undergoing neoplastic transformation (epithelial and/or lymphocytic). Because of the difficulty in distinguishing hyperplasia, thymoma, thymic lymphoma, and carcinoma on the basis of gross appearance or imaging results, histologic examination is important.",

Rabbits with thymoma may present with generalized scaling and sebaceous adenitis associated with thymoma.

In one study, rabbits that were intraperitoneally infected with spores of E. cuniculi were treated with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg first dose, then 15 mg/kg weekly during the 12-week experimental period).22 In these rabbits, clinical signs of encephalitozoonosis developed between weeks 4 and 6, and all died during week 6.

In three rabbits treated with surgery alone, postoperative survival ranged from 8 months to 3 years.1 Two rabbits treated with radiation therapy were also treated with surgical cytoreduction after completion of radiation.1 In a series of rabbits with mediastinal masses treated surgically by median sternotomy and mass excision, 7 of 14 rabbits survived 6 months or longer. One rabbit died during surgery, 6 died within 10 days after surgery, 1 survived 6 to 12 months, 4 survived 12 to 24 months, and 2 survived more than 24 months (F. Harcourt-Brown, personal communication, 2010). In a clinical report, a right fourth intercostal thoracotomy was performed in one rabbit with thymoma and the mass was excised. A chest drain was placed, but pneumothorax persisted after surgery and the rabbit was euthanized.60 In another rabbit, the mass was removed by median sternotomy.4 A chest drain was kept in place for 24 hours, after which it was removed and the rabbit recovered uneventfully. When the rabbit was euthanized 9 months later because of recurrent appendicular neurofibrosarcoma, no evidence of thymoma recurrence was present. In a clinical case seen by one of the present authors (AP), the mass was excised successfully but the patient went into cardiac arrest and died approximately 28 hours after surgery.",

A marked bronchointerstitial pattern is present in the caudal dorsal lung lobes compatible with pulmonary edema. The lung lobes are mildly retracted and the ventral border of the cardiac silhouette is obscured, indicating mild pleural effusion. B, In the ventrodorsal projection, a markedly enlarged left auricle is present (black arrowheads). An enlarged right atrium is also present (white arrowhead). An increased bronchointerstitial pattern is present in the caudal lung lobes, worse on the right than the left. Retraction of the lung lobe indicates pleural effusion (black arrows).",
