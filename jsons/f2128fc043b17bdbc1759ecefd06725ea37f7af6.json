In Wuhan, a large number of mixed patients of true or suspected COVID-19 cases and those with other pneumonia or respiratory infections swarmed into designated fever clinics. This brought tremendous pressure on patient triage at fever clinics. However, most of published COVID-19 papers focused on clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients but not COVID-19 outpatients. We searched PubMed for studies related to the biomarkers for effective triage of COVID-19 in clinics up to April 3, 2020.

COVID-19-like initial symptoms include fever and respiratory symptoms (such as dry cough and shortness of breath). 10 These symptoms are however not specific, and readily confused with other non-bacterial community-acquired pneumonia or common upper respiratory infection.

This significantly delayed diagnosis and subsequent quarantine or therapeutic decisions. Due to these reasons, many true COVID-19 patients were left un-diagnosed at fever clinics causing cross infection, or were self-isolated at home, which was however often ineffective and could lead to family cluster infections and poor prognosis because of delayed treatment. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop more effective ways of optimizing the triage process at fever clinics to sort suspected COVID-19 patients out of patients with similar symptoms. Those suspected COVID-19 patients would be prioritized for diagnostic CT examination and etiological PCR tests. Thus, we set to identify simple and quickly available laboratory parameters as biomarkers for precise and effective triage.",

As for laboratory findings, COVID-19 patients had significantly lower levels of leukocytes (5\u00b72 10 9 /L), neutrophils (3\u00b75 10 9 /L), lymphocytes (1\u00b71 10 9 /L), eosinophils (0\u00b701 10 9 /L), and platelets (178\u00b70 10 9 /L), but higher levels of hs-CRP (27\u00b74 mg/L) (all p value <0\u00b705), while similar levels of monocytes (0\u00b737 10 9 /L), red blood cell counts (4\u00b77 10 12 /L), and hemoglobin (140\u00b70 g/L) (all p value >0\u00b705), compared to the controls.

In the analysis, the specificity of including those two biomarkers was only 10\u00b72% and the PPV was low, only 48\u00b74%, meaning that more than half of patients identified using this guideline were not true COVID-19",

Our finding of eosinopenia and increased hs-CRP in COVID-19 patients may be a useful supplement to the triage strategy recommended by current WHO interim guideline, 11 as eosinophil counts and hs-CRP levels could be conveniently measured by technically simple routine blood tests even in small community clinics in resource-limited regions, which is particularly critical given that COVID-19 has been affecting more than 200 countries and territories, 3 such as countries in Middle-east and Africa. 29 This study has several limitations. First, the finding was obtained from the retrospective study, and the sample size in our study was not large and further validation of our findings in a larger prospective cohort is needed.
