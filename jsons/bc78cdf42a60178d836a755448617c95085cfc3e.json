The kinetics of appearance of antibodies directed to the major structural proteins N, M and E of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was followed in pigs naturally-and experimentallyexposed to the virus. Specific IgM antibody titers were first detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) at the end of the first week of PRRSV infection, peaked by day 14 to 21 post-inoculation (p.i.), then rapidly decreased to undetectable levels by day 35 to 42 p.i. On the other hand, specific IgG antibody titers peaked by day 21 to 28 p.i. and remained unchanged to the end of the 6-or 9-week observation period; in addition, a persistent viremia was observed. Virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers > 8 were not detected until 3 to 4 weeks p.i. Taken together, the results obtained by Western blotting analyses using purified virus and E. coli-expressed ORFs 5 to 7 gene products, suggested that antibodies directed against the envelope E protein appear by day 7 p.i., whereas antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid N and membrane M proteins can only be detected by the end of the second week p.i. No correlation could be demonstrated between VN and IIF antibody titers, viremia, and viral protein specificities of circulating antibodies at various times p.i.",

An antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism has been reported to explain the persistent infection of porcine alveolar macrophages and circulating monocytes [4, 8] . So far, little is known about the immunological status of PRRSV-infected pigs. Some investigators suggest that PRRSV causes immunosuppression because of the recrudescence of secondary bacterial infections among the infected pigs [8] . Previous data indicated that antibodies to PRRSV may be detected as soon as 1 to 2 weeks post-exposure using indirect immunofluorescence [18, 21] and the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay [20] . Virus neutralizing antibodies were reported to appear later during the infection, usually when clinical signs are resolved [18, 22] .",

The VN antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that neutralized CPE induced in MARC-145 cell monolayers by a constant dose of 100 TCID5 o of virus. Specific VN antibodies to PRRSV could be detected in sera samples from only half of the infected piglets (data not shown). Antibody titers > 8 were not observed until 3-4 weeks p.i., with maximal titers ranging between ---. To study the reactivity of pig sera to PRRSV specific proteins, immunoblotting experiments were performed using sucrose-gradient purified virus, as previously described [11] . Briefly, replicas of viral proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 1:50 dilution of the tested porcine sera. After washing in a 0.05 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were further incubated in the presence of 1:2000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-porcine IgG (Sigma). The immune complexes were revealed using a commercial alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (BioRad, Mississauga, Ont.), containing nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in TBS buffer. Under reducing conditions, the three major PRRSV structural proteins N (15kDa), M (18 kDa) and E (24.5 kDa) were consistently identified with the tissue cultureadapted IAF-Klop strain of PRRSV using homologous porcine hyperimmune serum [11] . In the immunoblotting experiments with sera from both naturallyand experimentally-infected pigs (Fig. 1) , seroconversion to the M and N proteins of PRRSV could not be demonstrated before the end of the first two weeks of infection. On the other hand, seroconversion to the E glycoprotein was generally obtained by the end of the third or fourth week p.i. Viral protein specificity of the humoral immune response of infected pigs was further confirmed by Western immunoblotting analyses using E.coli-expressed ORFs 5 to 7 gene products. Genomic RNA was extracted from purified virus by the one-step guanidinium isothiocyanate-acid phenol method [5] , then respective viral genes were amplified by RT-PCR, as previously described [12, 13] . Six oligonucleotide primers, containing EcoRI (sense primers) and BamHI (antisense primers) restriction sites at their 5'-end, were designed according to the sequence of the IAF-exp.91 strain of PRRSV (EMBL/GeneBank accession number L40898) [13] . The PCR amplified products were purified using the Geneclean II As illustrated in Fig. 2 , with clinical sera samples No. 22 and 33 (naturallyinfected pigs), antibodies directed against the recombinant E protein could be detected by the end of the first week of infection, whereas antibodies directed against the recombinant N and M proteins could only be detected by the end of the second week of the PRRSV infection. No reaction has been noticed with MBP protein (Fig. 2c) and GST protein (data not shown) alone.",

            "text": "In the present study, PRRSV-infected piglets generally developed mild clinical signs of a respiratory disease within the first week post-exposure to the virus that lasted not more than 3 to 7 days. However, all the animals tested remained viremic till the end of the 42 or 63-day observation period. Our data are in agreement with previous observations by others who demonstrated that PRRSV may persist for many weeks, even months in the infected pigs, despite their relatively high IIF antibody titers [14, 17, 23] . Noteworthy, our results on the detection of IgG antibodies to PRRSV in infected pigs sera are also compatible with previous findings that specific IgG antibodies can be detected by IIF from 11-14 days p.i. up to several weeks (more than 4-5 months) after exposure to the virus [14, 17] . In general, IgG antibody titers detected by IIF peaked by the end of the third or fourth week post-exposure. More recently, Nelson et al. [17] demonstrated that peaked IgG antibody titers to PRRSV (IIF titers > 1024) may persist in experimentally-infected pigs for more than 3 months, then decrease progressively to reach very low levels (IIF titers < 20) after more than 300 days p.i. Consequently, detection of IgG antibodies in pig sera may indicate that the animals have been infected by PRRSV in a recent or distant past. Since no correlation could be demonstrated between the levels of IgG antibody titers determined by IIF and the viremic status of the animals, one cannot precisely pin point when the exposure to the virus had occurred or whether the pigs had been carrying the virus for a long time. Interestingly, our results indicate that detection by IIF of IgM antibodies to PRRSV may provide more precise information in the serological diagnosis of PRRSV infection. Indeed, the short-term persistence of circulating specific IgM antibodies may be considered in the differentiation between acute and chronic PRRSV infections in pigs.",

Although the VN test has been reported to be less sensitive than the IIF tests and immunoblotting [17] , the long term persistence of PRRSV in the experimentally-or naturally-infected animals despite high levels of antibodies to PRRSV, raises the question as to what role the humoral immune response has in the protection to PRRSV infection. Also, it is possible for antibodies to enhance viral infection of Fc-receptor-positive cells such as macrophages, by forming immune complexes that use the Fc receptor to bind to the macrophages [4] . Thus, the putative protective role of neutralizing antibodies in PRRSV infection needs to be further documented.",

These results are in agreement with previous findings by others [17, 24] . However, it has been postulated that the stronger signal observed to the N and M proteins may reflect a higher molar ratio of these proteins in the virion relative to the E protein, or it may suggest a greater immunogenicity of these proteins in the pigs [17, 24] . The results obtained using E. coil-expressed ORFs 5 to 7 are in favor of the first hypothesis. Indeed, antibodies to the recombinant MBP-E protein could be demonstrated as early as 6 days pi, whereas antibodies to the N and M proteins could only be detected by the end of the second week p.i. This finding was not expected in case of the recombinant MBP-E protein since reactivity towards the viral envelope glycoprotein in immunoblotting experiments, using purified virus, could not be detected until the end of the third or fourth week p.i. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that when dealing with recombinant proteins, comparable amounts of the various proteins could be transferred onto the nitrocellulose membranes, whereas with purified viral preparations, the N and M proteins are expected to be present at a higher molar ratio comparative to the E glycoprotein [13, 16] . Indeed, in the case of equine arteritis virus it has been demonstrated that with the exception of Gs (small envelope glycoprotein), the proteins are approximately equal in abundance, being present at a molecular ratio of 3 (N): 2 (M): 3 (GI: large envelope glycoprotein) [7] . The Gs protein, which is expressed at a level similar to that of M in infected cells, is strikingly underrepresented in virus particles (1 to 2%) [7] . Thus, it can be expected that for PRRSV, the immunogenicity of the E glycoprotein in the pig is likely comparable to that of the N and M proteins.",

The neutralization process may be the result of virus interaction with antibodies directed against epitopes located on different viral proteins. Recently, we have been able to demonstrate that individually recombinant N, M and E proteins expressed by E. coli cells can induce the production of specific antibodies in rabbits and pigs; although IIF antibody titers to IAF-Klop strain ranged between 256 to 2048, the antisera are devoid of neutralization activity. Expression of recombinant viral proteins in eucaryotic vectors should permit us to demonstrate if the conformation and glycosylation of viral envelope proteins are essential requirements for the expression of epitopes involved in virus neutralization.",
