Moreover, considering the highly genetically variable kobuvirus characteristics, the WHJ-1 genomic information may also contribute to the primer design applied to the FeKoV viral detection method.Bayesian evolutionary analysis based on the FeKoV VP1 gene showed that the time to the most recent common ancestor was 5.3 years, and the substitution rate was 1.29 9 10 \u00c02 substitutions/site/year, demonstrating that FeKoV emerged recently in the feline population and mutated rapidly(Cho et al., 2015).
