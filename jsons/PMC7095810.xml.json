            "text": "Transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells is a therapeutic option in multiple hematological malignancies, bone marrow failure and inherited immunodeficiency syndromes (Arcese et al. 2006; Torok-Storb et al. 1997). Because of the inability to find suitable, HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell donors in a significant proportion of patients, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is considered an alternative and widely accepted source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation (Arcese et al. 2006; Brown and Boussiotis 2008). A suitable cord blood unit can be found for the majority of patients, as the matching of HLA molecules is less strict, allowing for a match at only 8/10 HLA alleles. Moreover, UCB transplantation (UCBT) was shown to be associated with lower rates of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which is one of the factors affecting transplant-related mortality. However, the major limitation of UCBT use in adults is the relatively low number of hematopoietic stem cells in a single unit, which significantly increases the risk of graft failure and infectious complications in the period of pancytopenia (Arcese et al. 2006; Tse and Laughlin 2005). One of the strategies to overcome this problem is the simultaneous transplantation of multiple cord blood units, coming from various unrelated donors (transplantation of so-called mixed UCB) (Tse and Laughlin 2005). While some strategies are in preclinical stages, others are at advanced phases of clinical trials (Arcese et al. 2006; Brown and Boussiotis 2008; Tse and Laughlin 2005). The main strategies are based on ex vivo expansion of the UCB stem cells, intra-bone marrow transplantation, co-transplantation with other stem cell sources, or reduction of the toxicity of the conditioning regimens (Brown and Boussiotis 2008; Tse and Laughlin 2005).",

            "text": "The subfamily of the \u03b2-herpesviruses includes the human CMV (HHV-5) and the two closely related roseoloviruses human herpesvirus HHV-6 and HHV-7 (Davison et al. 2005). All of them are widespread pathogens with a high seroprevalence in the adult population (Griffiths et al. 2000), and like all other herpesviruses, the members of the \u03b2-herpesvirinae can be reactivated from their state of latency in immunocompromised hosts (Ljungman 2002). Thus, CMV infections are a serious matter of concern in a group of immunosuppressed patients (Griffiths et al. 2000; Ljungman 2002; Ljungman et al. 2008). The syndromes most commonly seen include: CMV pneumonia, myelosuppression syndrome (Takami et al. 2005), exacerbation of GvHD and increased risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infections (Griffiths et al. 2000). HHV-6 presence in plasma or serum was documented in 33\u201348% of hematopoietic stem cell recipients, using molecular techniques (Zerr et al. 2005). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), advanced hematological disease, younger age, gender mismatch between donor and recipient and treatment with corticosteroids are commonly reported risk factors associated with HHV-6 infection after transplantation (Chan et al. 1997; Ljungman et al. 2008; Zerr et al. 2005). The pathogenicity of HHV-7 in immunocompromised individuals and in primary infection remains unclear (Ljungman et al. 2008; Yamanishi 2002). Some authors have postulated a potential increase in virulence of HHV-7 in the course of a simultaneous CMV reactivation, leading to a greater risk of CMV disease transplantation (Chan et al. 1997; Kidd et al. 2000; Mendez et al. 2001).",

The common occurrence of coinfection among CMV and HHV-7 attests to the ubiquitous nature of these viruses (Chan et al. 1997; Mendez et al. 2001). Other authors have demonstrated that HHV-6 and HHV-7 reactivation occurs earlier than CMV (Chan et al. 1997; Mendez et al. 2001; Zerr et al. 2005), and HHV-7 has been implicated as a factor for subsequent CMV reactivation and disease (Chan et al. 1997; Mendez et al. 2001). Our observations show that HHV-7 viremia may also occur simultaneously at the time of active infection caused by other \u03b2-herpesviruses. In this study, HHV-7 was observed in all four CMV-infected UCBT recipients and in a single case of HHV-6 disease. Since cord blood contains few memory T cells to respond to exogenous antigens, it may take longer to reconstitute pathogen-specific immunity (Brown and Boussiotis 2008). Acyclovir in typical doses was used as an antiviral prophylaxis during this period, but without any visible clinical success. In all cases of CMV disease ganciclovir was routinely used as a therapy of choice, despite its myelotoxic activity (Ljungman et al. 2004, 2008). It is thus important to reduce drug administration as a decreasing number of viral DNA copies is detected. The efficacy of ganciclovir against HHV-6 and HHV-7 in vivo is still not well documented, its use was only associated with a non-significant decline in the HHV-6 level in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (Zerr et al. 2002).",

In patient No. 4, CMV was the only infectious agent found during the course of a pneumonia episode, occurring directly after GvHD and pyrexia. Although in patient No. 5 CMV was correlated in time with pneumonia, it seems rather that CMV was a concomitant agent attending a systemic infection caused by Acinetobacter baumannii repeatedly isolated from the patient\u2019s blood samples. This infection eventually led to sepsis and ARDS, which were the direct cause of the patient\u2019s death. In a third patient with a pneumonia episode (patient No. 6), there was no detectable DNAemia caused by \u03b2-herpesviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus was the agent responsible for this fatal infection. Thus, from a general point of view, despite the low number of examined UCBT recipients, \u03b2-herpesviruses DNAemia either did not correlate with clinical symptoms (patients No. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7) or accompanied mild CMV pneumonia (patients No. 4 and 5).",

During this time (including adjacent 2-week periods), acute GvHD was observed in two individuals, patients No. 1 and 4, and in both cases GvHD directly preceded CMV and HHV-7 DNAemia.
