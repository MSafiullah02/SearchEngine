By Apr 7, 2020, it has resulted in more than 1250,000 infections and over 70,000 deaths worldwide. The coronavirus spreads from person to person through mouth or nose generated droplets from sneezes and/or coughs. The coronavirus can also shortly survive on surface of different objects and is transmitted through direct contact. The COVID-19 epidemic has caused severe psychological pressure to common public population, medical staff in most clinics, and anyone with suspected symptoms.",

Specifically, psychiatry hospital is unique since they serve for patients of impaired mental functions, with isolated and locked wards services, and has difficulties in executing the protection policies (asking patients to wear masks). The patients also have insufficient cognitive abilities to recognize the risk of infection and to actively avoid related activities. Notably, in late Feb 2020, a cluster infection is reported at 101 out of 103 patients in psychiatric ward at South Korea\u2018s Daenam hospital. Last but not least, medical staff are facing significant psychological pressure during this special period (Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020, Li et al., 2020, Montemurro, 2020).",
