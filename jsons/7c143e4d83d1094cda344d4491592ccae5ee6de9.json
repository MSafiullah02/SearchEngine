The main cause is smoking tobacco, but other factors have been identifi ed. Several pathobiological processes interact on a complex background of genetic determinants, lung growth, and environmental stimuli. The disease is further aggravated by exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe disease, up to 78% of which are due to bacterial infections, viral infections, or both. Comorbidities include ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and lung cancer. Bronchodilators constitute the mainstay of treatment: \u03b2 2 agonists and long-acting anticholinergic agents are frequently used (the former often with inhaled corticosteroids). Besides improving symptoms, these treatments are also thought to lead to some degree of disease modifi cation. Future research should be directed towards the development of agents that notably aff ect the course of disease.",

Its pulmonary component is characterized by airfl ow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airfl ow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal infl ammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases\". 1 The general view of this disease is that it will become one of the major health challenges of the next few decades. Prevalence surveys suggest that up to almost a quarter of adults aged 40 years and older have mild airfl ow obstruction. [2] [3] [4] COPD is presently the fourth leading cause of death, but WHO predicts that it will become the third leading cause by 2030; 5 mortality owing to cardiac diseases and stroke decreased over the period 1970-2002, but that of COPD doubled over the same period. 6 In the past two decades important progress has been made in the understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of COPD, but important issues remain unresolved. Particular concerns are the causes and mechanisms of disease, mechanisms of infl ammation, whether to diagnose early, identifi cation of eff ective biomarkers, the relation between airway disease and comorbidities, and the development of treatments to increase disease modifi cation. In this Seminar we provide an overview of the insights that have been gained and those that are lacking. We also attempt to defi ne some research questions for the next decade.",

In developing countries prevalence has risen strikingly, owing to increased smoking rates and reductions in other causes of death, particularly from severe infections.

Moreover, although COPD has been typically seen in men, prevalence in women has risen because of the increasing number of those older than 50 years who smoke.

            "text": "The principal feature of COPD is limitation of airfl ow that is not fully reversible. Remodelling of the smallairway compartment and loss of elastic recoil by emphysematous destruction of parenchyma result in progressive decline of FEV\u2081, inadequate lung emptying on expiration, and subsequent static and dynamic hyperinfl ation. 22 At the pathological level, exposure to smoke leads to infi ltration of the mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue by infl ammatory cells. Increased mucus content, epithelial-cell hyperplasia, and disturbed tissue repair with wall thickening in the small conducting airways are cardinal features of COPD (fi gure 1). 23 This progressive narrowing, obliteration, and even removal of the terminal bronchioles is accompanied by emphysema, which typically starts in the respiratory bronchioles. 24 The mechanisms that lead to thickening of the small-airway walls and destruction of lung tissue are far from understood, 23 but they are likely to be multifactorial pathobiological processes 25 that are interacting on a complex background of genetic determinants, 26 lung growth, 14 and environmental stimuli (fi gure 2). 3, 13 Within this framework we discuss the pathogenesis of COPD as a progressive immunological disorder. 27 Cigarette smoke causes direct injury of airway epithelial cells, which leads to the release of endogenous intracellular molecules or danger-associated molecular patterns. These signals are identifi ed by pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 on epithelial cells, and a non-specifi c infl ammatory response is triggered. 28 Upon the release of early cytokines (tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukins 1 and 8), macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are recruited to the site of infl ammation to orchestrate the innate immune response. 29, 30 Proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species are released and, if not suffi ciently counterbalanced by antiproteases and antioxidant factors, further damage will occur. 31 Immature dendritic cells pick up self-antigens released from damaged tissue and foreign antigens from incoming pathogens and present them to naive T cells in the draining lymph nodes. 29 Once activated into T-helper-1 cells, these antigen-specifi c CD4 and CD8 cells and antibody-producing B cells are drawn to the lungs to neutralise the antigens. As the disease progresses, tertiary lymphoid aggregates, including an oligoclonal selection of the B and T cells involved, develop around the small airways. 32, 33 Although the exact nature and function of these aggregates needs to be elucidated, adaptive or autoimmune responses are thought to perpetuate the infl ammation years after smoking cessation. 27, 34 Apart from these basic immunological processes, several other mechanisms might contribute to the infl ammatory cascade. Tapering of the immune response by regulatory T cells protects against uncontrolled infl ammation, 35 and reduced populations of these cells have been seen in the lungs of patients with COPD. 34, 36 By contrast, the numbers of proinfl ammatory T-helper-17 cells rise, 37,38 which suggests impaired immune regulation in COPD. Pulmonary emphysema and cellular ageing share some features: 25, 39 senescence leads to cells becoming non-proliferative but metabolically active, which predisposes individuals to increased infl ammation, reduced cell regeneration, and carcino genesis. Cigarette smoke and oxidative stress promote senescence. 40 As such, COPD can be interpreted as accelerated ageing of the lung, and hence age will increase suscep tibility to COPD. 41 Finally, cellular apoptosis and matrix destruction are continuously compensated for by cellular renewal and matrix repair to maintain lung homoeo stasis. 42 Resident stem cells within the lung are activated by epithelial damage 43 but cigarette smoke limits alveolar repair 44 and dysregulates repair processes involving transforming growth factor \u03b2, which leads to fi brosis. 45 The underlying molecular signals are poorly understood, but in COPD repair mechanisms eventually fail. The complexity of the pathogenesis of COPD is refl ected in the broad variation of clinical phenotypes. Further research is needed to clarify to what extent mechanisms off er potential for new targeted inter ventions.",

            "text": "The chronic and progressive course of COPD is frequently aggravated by exacerbations-short periods (at least 48 h) of increased cough, dyspnoea, and production of sputum that can become purulent. Mild exacerbations require increased doses of bronchodilators, moderate exacerbations need treatment with systemic corti costeroids, antibiotics, or both, and severe exacerbations frequently necessitate admission to hospital. Some patients have no or few exacerbations, whereas others have frequent exacerbations. Frequency may increase with increasing severity of COPD. In a systematic review by Hoogendoorn and colleagues, 46 37 studies were identifi ed that defi ned exacerbations according to use of resources. Patients with mild COPD had a mean of 0\u00b782 exacerbations per year, and the rates increased to 1\u00b717, 1\u00b761, and 2\u00b701 in patients with moderate, severe, and very severe disease, respectively. Other characteristics besides severity of COPD are strongly associated with frequent exacerbations, but the best predictor is a history of frequent exacerbations. 47 Exacerbations reduce quality of life, 48 speed disease progression, and increase the risk of death. 49 Because of their impact on the natural history of the disease, a primary goal of treatment is to reduce the number of exacerbations. They are diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms. No clear biological markers have been identifi ed. 50 The most promising biomarker so far is amyloid A in serum. In proteomic studies raised concentrations distinguished patients in exacerbated states from those with stable disease and those with severe exacerbations from patients with milder exacerbations. 51 These data require confi rmation in large multicentre studies.",

The most frequent cause is viral or bacterial infection. In patients admitted to hospital for COPD exacerbations, viral infections, bacterial infections, or both, were detected in 78% of cases and, more importantly, the exacerbations were more severe than those in patients with non-infectious causes, shown by more marked impairment in lung function and longer times in hospital. 52 The accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial causes is the isolation of a potentially pathogenic micro-organism in sputum culture. This method, however, is neither sensitive nor specifi c enough to be accurate. Clinical criteria must, therefore, also be taken into account to aid in the decision of whether or not to use antibiotics. The presence of green (purulent) as opposed to white (mucoid) sputum is one of the best and easiest methods of predicting the need for antibiotic therapy. 53, 54 Measurement of procalcitonin concentrations in serum has shown promise as a guide of whether to use antibiotics, 55 although C-reactive protein has shown better results in the prediction of response to antibiotic therapy. 56 Future research will establish the usefulness of both these bio markers in ambulatory patients treated in the community.",

            "text": "An additional diffi culty in the identifi cation of microbial causes for COPD exacerbations is that a substantial proportion of patients with stable disease have bacterial colonisation in the lower airways. Various species colonise the airways, but Haemophilus infl uenzae is most frequently seen. 57 The production of purulent sputum when patients are in a stable state indicates colonisation by potentially pathogenic micro-organisms. 58 Colonising bacteria promote bronchial and systemic infl ammation and release antigens that result in bronchial epithelial injury and facilitate the acquisition of new microbial strains, 59 which is associated with an increased risk of developing an exacerbation. 60 Strain changes for H infl uenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are associated with increased bronchial and systemic infl ammation and the development of exacer bations. 61 Colonising bacteria can, therefore, accelerate the progression of COPD through an increase in the frequency of exacerbations and also through direct injury to the lung tissue (fi gure 3). 59, 62, 63 The type of infecting species depends partly on the severity of the underlying COPD. 64 In mild disease, Immune control S pneumoniae is predominant, whereas in patients with low FEV\u2081, H infl uenzae and M catarrhalis are more frequently seen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa might be seen in patients with severe obstruction, and acquisition of a new strain is associated with the development of an exacerbation and colonisation of bronchial epithelium. 65 Disease evolution can be worsened without prompt appropriate antibiotic therapy 66 or if a multidrug-resistant strain is present. 67 Some of the risk factors associated with P aeruginosa infection are summarised (panel 2). 64, 68, 69 Viruses are thought to account for 15-25% of all infective exacerbations, particularly human rhinovirus, infl uenza and parainfl uenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Concomitant infection with viruses and bacteria are seen in 25% of patients with exacerbations who are admitted to hospital. 52 Viral exacerbations are strongly correlated with colds at presentation, high frequency of exacerbations, and severe respiratory symptoms during exacerbations. Mallia and co-workers 70 used experimental rhinovirus infection in individuals with COPD and noted the development of lower-airway respiratory symptoms, airfl ow obstruction, systemic infl ammation, and infl ammation of the airways. A signifi cant correlation was also seen between viral load and concentrations of infl ammatory markers. These fi ndings strongly support a causal relation between rhinovirus infection and COPD exacerbations. No diagnostic test is available for viral exacerbations of COPD. Increased concentrations of interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 in serum was useful in one study to identify rhinovirus infection in patients with COPD. 71 The presence of fever has also been associated with virus detection during exacerbations. 72 ",

For instance, cigarette smoking is a major risk for COPD and cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and lung cancer. 78 Abundant evidence shows that physical inactivity, which is frequently observed in people who develop COPD, 79 is linked to the major comorbidities. 80, 81 Finally, ageing is a major risk factor for 82 and for COPD in particular a cluster analysis indicated that age rather than FEV\u2081 accounted for most of the comorbidities and symptoms. 83 One common denominator across comorbidities is systemic infl ammation. Increased concentrations of circulating cytokines (tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukins 6 and 8), adipokines (leptin, ghrelin), and acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, fi brinogen) are seen in most of the diseases. Furthermore, all described risk factors have been directly linked to the presence of systemic infl ammation. [84] [85] [86] In several studies biomarkers of systemic infl ammation have been seen in patients with COPD, particularly when disease is severe and during acute exacerbations. 87 Whether these systemic markers spill over from the lungs into the systemic circulation or merely refl ect the proinfl ammatory state is unclear. 84, 88, 89 Clinical management",

            "text": "The most widely applied guideline for treatment is the GOLD guideline (table) . 1 For all patients, smoking cessation, reduction in exposure to environmental and occupational risk factors, and yearly infl uenza vaccinations are recommended. The fi rst step must be smoking cessation. This intervention lessens the decline of FEV\u2081 by about 35 mL per year, 90,91 which slows disease progression and lowers mortality by 18%. 92 Inhaled bronchodilators are the mainstay treatment for COPD (table) . For very severe disease (GOLD stage 4) surgical options include lung trans plantation and lung-volume reduction if quality of life is unacceptably low. Respiratory rehabilitation should be considered at all stages (table) in patients with muscle weakness, deconditioning, and poor quality of life. This treatment should be aimed at improving quality of life and exercise capacity. [93] [94] [95] Two large-scale, long-term, landmark studies have confi rmed the effi cacy of a fi xed combination of a long-acting \u03b2 2 agonist (salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (fl uticasone) 96 and a long-acting anticholinergic agent (tiotropium). 97 The two regimens had similar eff ects on prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV\u2081 (increases of 87-103 mL and 47-92 mL, respectively), scores on the St George's respiratory questionnaire for health status (reductions of three units), and the frequency of exacerbations (reductions of 14-25%). The eff ects of tiotropium seemed smaller, but might be explained by the use of other active treatments: up to 74% of the patients took long-acting \u03b2 2 agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, or both. 97 Greater eff ects on health status and frequency of exacerbations in patients receiving tiotropium versus placebo had been reported previously. [98] [99] [100] A direct comparison of a fi xed combination and tiotropium confi rmed similar eff ects on the frequency of exacerbations, but the eff ect on health status was slightly larger with the combined therapy. 101 Inhaled medications used for the treatment of COPD have good safety profi les. Typical side-eff ects of inhaled anticholinergics are dry mouth and prostatism, 102 and for inhaled steroids are skin bruising 103 ocular eff ects, and osteoporosis. 104 \u03b2 2 agonists are associated with tremor and cardiac eff ects. 104 Cardiovascular side-eff ects of tiotropium and ipratropium were reported in a metaanalysis by Singh and colleagues, 105 but this fi nding was not confi rmed in a trial of tiotropium 106 and a later review of all tiotropium trials. 102 The latter was accepted as suffi cient proof of the absence of toxic eff ects by the US Food and Drug Administration. 107 A fi xed combination of \u03b2 2 agonists and inhaled steroids has been associated with the risk of pneumonia. 96, [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] This risk does not seem to be present with budesonide, 113 although the reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Several issues related to the treatment of COPD are the subjects of debate. The most important is probably whether bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or both, modify the disease course. No direct evidence clearly shows a disease-modifying role, but circumstantial evidence is accumulating. Two large landmark trials have shown a trend for reduced mortality with fi xed combinations 96 and signifi cantly reduced mortality was seen with a long-acting anti-cholinergic agent in two analyses, although this eff ect was not seen in a third analysis. 97 A post-hoc analysis showed a signifi cant reduction in the decline of FEV\u2081, by 16 mL per year, with fi xed combinations, 114 and a prespecifi ed subgroup analysis showed a reduction of 6 mL per year with a long-acting anticholinergic agent in patients with GOLD stage 2 COPD. 115 In the latter analysis most of the patients in the control group were taking a combination of a long-acting \u03b2 2 agonists and an inhaled steroid and, therefore, these eff ects on annual rate of decline seem to be additive. Thus, with the appropriate combination of agents, tangible eff ects might be obtained. In a smaller subgroup of patients who took no maintenance medications at the beginning of the trial, tiotropium slowed the rate of decline in postbronchodilator FEV\u2081 by 11 mL per year and of deterioration in health-related quality of life by two-thirds. 116 Finally, safety data indicate that reductions in the incidence of respiratory failure and myocardial infarction as a serious adverse events have been seen with tiotropium. 97 Another question of great interest is whether early pharmacotherapy-when disease is in GOLD stages 1 and 2-is warranted in COPD. 117 Again, no direct evidence presently supports this practice because no prospective, randomised, controlled trials have been done. The studies of fi xed combinations and tiotropium mentioned above both showed that the eff ects of pharmacotherapy were similar in patients with GOLD stage 2 COPD and those with more advanced disease. 115, 118 Decline in FEV\u2081, and hence disease progression, is faster in the early stages of COPD than in the later stages. 90, 96, 97 Early intervention, therefore, seems as though it would be benefi cial. Figure 5 summarises, in a so-called Fletcher-Peto diagram, the data on FEV\u2081 decline in relation to age from two landmark studies. 117, 119 Although some evidence of a reduced rate of decline in FEV\u2081 is present in GOLD stage 2 particularly, 116, 118 the lines depicting the decline in FEV\u2081 in the diff erent GOLD stages are essentially parallel. Thus, how patients would move from GOLD stage 2 to 3, and further to 4, is hard to conceive. Several potential explanations for this pattern may be off ered. First, patients who reach GOLD stages 3-4 have poor pulmonary function at diagnosis (lower intercept). For instance, patients who have low lung function at presentation because of genetic factors or exposure to environmental factors before age 4 years are at increased risk of developing chronic respiratory disease. 4,120 Second, patients who reach GOLD stages 3-4 also have a faster decline earlier in the disease course than patients in whom disease reaches less advanced stages. 90, 115, 118 Finally, comorbidities of COPD arise in the early disease stages. 73, 74 No randomised controlled trials have yet been done to investigate whether treatment with broncho dilators or inhaled corticosteroids reduces the prevalence or severity of comorbidities. Observational studies suggest that statins, \u03b2 blockers, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors improve outcomes and survival, [121] [122] [123] although these studies might be statistically fl awed simply because of their observational nature. 124 A last relevant question is whether continuous treatment with antibiotics is useful in stable COPD. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, have been the subject of substantial interest in the past 5 years. In one randomised study of long-term erythromycin compared with placebo in patients with COPD, exacerbations were less frequent (35% reduction) and shorter (13 vs 9 days) in the macrolide group. 125 In a randomised study of 1577 patients, treatment with azithromycin for 1 year lowered the risk of an exacerbation by 27% and improved quality of life by 2\u00b78 units on the St George's respiratory questionnaire but caused decrements in hearing more frequently than placebo. 126 Potential eff ects of azithro mycin have been related to increased alveolar macrophage phagocytic function. 127, 128 One study assessed the eff ect of pulse therapy with moxifl oxacin for 5 days every 8 weeks. A 19% reduction in the frequency of exacerbations was seen, 129 but this eff ect requires confi rmation in other studies. Other agents that might be of benefi t in the treatment of COPD include phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as theophylline, mucolytic agents, and antioxidants. 130 The only eff ect that seems to have been reported is a 21% reduction in the rate of exacerbations with mucolytic agents. 131 This eff ect might be larger in patients only taking short-acting bronchodilators, 132 and is not seen in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids. 133",

If no response is noted, oral corticosteroids may be added. If changes are seen in expectorated sputum, antibiotics can be used, and if severity increases, other interventions, such as theophylline, should be considered. Oxygen and ventilatory support is recommended if respiratory failure occurs (fi gure 6). 136 Non-invasive ventilatory support is the fi rst approach to hypercapnic respiratory failure and is eff ective in avoiding intubation and reducing the risk of death. 137 Cochrane reviews support the use of short-acting bronchodiolators, 138 systemic corticosteroids, 139 anti biotics, 140 and non-invasive ventilation, 137 and a meta-analysis supports the use of theophylline. 141 Besides these respiratory treatments, the complexity (eg, associated with pneumonia, heart failure, or pneumothorax) need to be taken into account and comorbidities need to be treated appropriately.",

Additionally, agents that possess simultaneous anticholinergic and \u03b2 2 -agonist activities (muscarinic antagonist \u03b2 2 agonists) are being devel oped. 147 These latter agents will probably improve symptomatic control, but it seems unlikely that they will modify disease substantially more than available agents. By contrast, enhanced disease modifi cation is expected from a range of novel infl ammatory blockers that includes inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4, agents targeting CD8+ T cells, 142 and inhibitors of NF-\u03baB, 142 chemokine-receptors 2 and 3, 142, 148 T-helper-17 cells, 142 and MAP kinase p38. 142, 149 Interest has been shown in the role of the vitamin D pathway in chronic diseases in general and in COPD in particular. 150, 151 In one study a high prevalence of vitamin D defi ciency was found and variants in the vitamin-Dbinding gene (GC) correlated with vitamin D levels and the risk of COPD. 152 Impaired macrophage function, which improves after vitamin D supplementation, is probably related to the development of COPD. 128 Randomised controlled trials are being done to assess the eff ects of vitamin D supplementation on the disease course of COPD (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00977873). 153 In the fi rst of these studies, vitamin D supplementation did not reduce COPD exacerbations in the whole study population, but it did in a subgroup with low vitamin D levels (<10 ng/mL) at baseline. 153 Finally, entirely new care models need to be developed for patients with COPD as well as other chronic diseases. In view of the comorbidities frequently seen in patients with COPD, new models for multidisciplinary care, clinical pathways, self-management, 154 teleconsultating, 155 telemonitoring, and rehabilitation 99 are required. In studies the latter four modalities have been associated with clear eff ects on outcomes, but access to these services remains poor-for instance, rehabilitation is applied to less than 5% of the eligible patients. 99, 153, 154 ",
