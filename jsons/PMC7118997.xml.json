EV-71 usually cause mild hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) characterized by fever with papulovesicular rash on the palms and soles (Ooi et al., 2010). In recent years, EV-71 infections were also associated with neurological complications with high mortalities among infants and young children < 6 years old (Solomon et al., 2010). To date, no effective antiviral agent is available for clinical use (Shang et al., 2013b, Tan et al., 2014). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective antiviral agents to treat EV-71 infection.",

The mismatched RNA target sequences were designed to reflect the most likely natural variations that would arise in the EV-71 sequence. As shown in Fig. 6B, the EV-71 MO-1-mutant-1, which carried a single point mutation at position 533 (T to C substitution), required higher vivo-MO-1 concentrations to achieve a similar inhibitory effect when compared to the wild type.

Increasing the number of mutations on the targeted sequence significantly reduced the inhibitory efficacy of vivo-MO-1.

            "text": "Amongst the three vivo-MOs being examined, the two vivo-MOs targeting the EV-71 IRES stem-loop region exhibited significant antiviral activity. The vivo-MOs blocked EV-71 viral RNA translation in a cell-free inhibition assay, as well as in a cell-based EGFP reporter inhibition assay. Previous studies have also reported that only PMOs targeting the positive strand IRES regions or the AUG start codon sites were effective when compared to PMOs targeting other regions of the viral RNA (Stone et al., 2008, Vagnozzi et al., 2007, Yuan et al., 2006). The PMO may bind with the complementary viral RNA and disrupt the integrity of the IRES stem-loop secondary or tertiary structures, hence arresting IRES-dependent translation (Kole et al., 2012, Warren et al., 2012). The PMOs are likely to block 40S ribosomal subunit binding the viral RNA in the vicinity of the stem-loop V in the picornaviral type I IRES (Belsham, 2009). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the IRES stem-loop V-VI of EV-71 interacts with IRES-specific trans-acting factors such as FUSE-binding protein and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Al (Lin et al., 2009a, Lin et al., 2009b, Shih et al., 2011). Unlike synthetic double-stranded siRNA which involve cleavage of mRNA, PMOs are translation-suppressing oligonucleotides which do not lead to RNA degradation (Kole et al., 2012, Warren et al., 2012). This could explain why siRNA targeting the similar viral sequences as vivo-MO-3 was effective, but not acting as a translation suppression oligonucleotide which down-regulates gene expression via steric blockage. IRES-targeting vivo-MO-2 exhibited broad-spectrum activities against multiple enteroviruses, but with different antiviral efficacies. This could have resulted from the IRES stem-loop structure differences between enteroviruses which affect the accessibility of the vivo-MOs to the targeted sites (Dias and Stein, 2002).",

We failed to isolate any EV-71 resistant to vivo-MO-2 even after eight passages in vitro, implying that the vivo-MO-2 targeted region is intolerant to mutation in nature. Our mutagenesis studies further confirm that the position of mutation and the number of mutations affect the antiviral efficacies in RD cells. A single mismatch present in the middle of the targeted sequence (T to C substitution at position 523) was more tolerable than a mutation appearing at the end of the targeted site (T to C substitution at position 533). These findings correlated well with previous findings that PV, FMDV and WNV that showed resistance to PPMO also carry a single point mutation at the end of the PPMO-targeted sequence (Stone et al., 2008, Vagnozzi et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2008). A similar observation has been made for influenza virus as the degree of inhibition was associated with the number of mismatches (Ge et al., 2006).",

The vivo-MOs worked well with low micromolar concentrations to inhibit EV-71 infection and showed little cytotoxicity in RD cells. The potent inhibition of several enteroviruses by vivo-MO-2 raises the possibility that it could be developed as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. Furthermore, the degree of tolerance of mismatches by vivo-MOs suggests a favorable characteristic for their use as a potential antiviral agent.",
