Tumor cells rewire their metabolism to promote growth, survival, proliferation and long-term maintenance through increased uptake of glucose and its fermentation to lactate (Warburg effect) [3] . These cells in spite of competing for resources and space also cooperate with each other by secreting diffusible factors that promote tumor growth and invasion through metastasis [4e6] . Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in cancer comprising sequential steps for cancer cells dissemination from primary sites and secondary tumor growth at distant region. Disseminated cancer cells can grow out and form secondary tumors in distant area through invasion into local stroma and intravasation into vascular circulation [7] . The interaction between the cancer cells and microenvironment is essential for cancer progression. However, only a small fraction of the disseminated cells called metastatic stem cells are able to grow and overlap the important signaling pathways of normal cells such as Wnt, Notch and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) essential for metastatic progression [8] .

The presence of leucine residue on the L2 loop plays an exceptional role in maintaining the catalytic activity of caspases [30] . Moreover, leucine deficiency also triggers apoptotic death of cancerous cells [31] . Several interactions like hydrogen boding, pep stacking and other hydrophobic interactions play a key role in the binding of compound with enzyme active sites ( Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 330, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 331, "end": 334, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 738, "end": 742, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 906, "end": 914, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Docking"}, {"text": "The hydrogen bonding occurs owing to the presence of electronegative atom (for example oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine) indicates strong binding while pep and pealkyl interactions are also occurred due to the presence of p electrons/bonds in the benzoxazinone group (Table 1 ). All the ligands with different groups bound with same binding pocket and almost with the same residues with slight difference in number of residues and bond type. The docking score indicated the strength of bond formed and helped us to find the inhibitor constant (K i ). The inhibitor constant has vital importance in drug designing because it specifies the inhibition potential to yield half concentration after inhibition. The K i has inevitable effect on IC 50 affecting the mode of action of drug. Smaller the K i value better will be the IC 50 [1] . Table 1 showed the results of docking score, K i values and nature of binding interactions. The binding poses of compounds (3a, 3c and 3h) at their maximum bound cavity are shown in Fig. 9-14 . The binding affinity and inhibitory constant (ki) of compound (3h) was same as that of standard doxorubicin which is best value i.e. \u00c07.4 while the secondbest value was given by compound (3a) i.e. \u00c07.3. The residues in compound (3a, 3c and 3h) were Leu 168, Tyr 204, Trp 206, Ser 251 and Phe 256 while the residues in standard were Tyr 204, Ser 251 and His 121. Hence the main residues like Tyrosine and Serine were present in most of the compounds. While in experimental results compound (3c) with para hydroxyl and compound (3k) with 3,4-dimethoxy moieties showed highest activity.
