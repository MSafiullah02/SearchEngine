            "text": "Epidemiological investigations were initiated on February 20 to trace the source of H7N9 viruses causing human infection. The patient began to manage this small-scale poultry farm in August 2013, and approximately 600 chickens, 140 guinea fowl (Numidameleagris), 173 black-bone Silkie chickens (Gallus gallusdomesticus), 6 turkeys and a goose were raised together in a warehouse. Between August 2013 and February 2014, a total of seven batches of poultry were introduced to this farm (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information). In August 2013, 6 turkeys and 33 guinea fowl (N. meleagris) were introduced from an agricultural fair that was held August 16\u201325, 2013 in Changchun City. In October 2013, approximately 107 guinea fowl (N. meleagris) and 173 black-bone Silkie chickens (G. gallusdomesticus) were introduced from a farm in Siping City, some of which subsequently sickened and died. More black-bone Silkie chickens than the other types of poultry died. A local veterinarian reported that the cause of death of this batch of birds resulted from air sacculitis and enteritis. Testing for avian influenza virus was not performed. On December 24, 2013, 97 chickens were introduced from a dealer's farm that was sufficiently disinfected, and no deaths occurred in this batch of birds. On December 27, 2013, the same dealer acquired 170 chickens from two free-range farmers in Yongji County and delivered those chickens to the patient's farm. Additionally, a poultry worker hired by the patient brought one goose and 4\u20135 chickens onto the farm. On February 3 and February 10, the second dealer introduced approximately 290 chickens from free-range farms in Xiaoyang in Dongfeng County onto the patient's farm. On February 12, the same dealer introduced the last batch of 90 chickens obtained in Wuxinghong in Dongfeng County to the patient's farm. Subsequent signs of illness and death widely occurred after the sixth batch of chickens were introduced on February 10, and approximately 200 chickens had died by February 22. The patient had checked the farm daily without personal protection and developed illness on February 15. No close contacts presented clinical symptoms, except for one individual with fever who had accompanied the patient when consulting the veterinarian for a diagnosis of the dead chickens. A series of throat swabs collected from this close contact were negative for influenza A virus. Paired serum samples collected from close contacts were seronegative for H7N9 virus infection (Table S1).",

All seven H7N9 viruses, including the human isolate, demonstrated the G186 V mutation in the HA gene and the Q226 L mutation, with the exception of one virus isolated from a chicken that contained 226Q; these results indicated an increased preference for human-like receptor (\u03b12\u20136) binding1516. All of the NA genes examined possessed a 69\u201373 amino acid deletion in the stalk region, which is related to enhanced virulence in mice as well as adaption and transmission in domestic poultry17. Although the viruses isolated from the farm contained 701D and 627E, the human isolate, A/Jilin/10117/2014 (H7N9), possessed a D701N mutation without an E627K mutation in the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) gene, which has been proposed to be associated with high polymerase activity and increased virulence in mice1819. The PB1 L368V mutation, which increases transmission in ferrets20, was identified in all of the viruses. The signature amino acids of the human influenza virus polymerase acidic protein (PA) gene were detected, including K356R and S409N21. Drug resistance mutations were detected in the matrix protein 2 (M2) gene (S31N); however, the E119V/A/D, R152K, H274Y and R292K mutations were not detected in the NA gene, indicating that the H7N9 viruses were resistant to amantadine and sensitive to NA inhibitors222324.",

Items (1) and (2) provided the upper and lower bounds of the date of introduction of H7N9 to the farm, respectively, and item (3) provided an upper bound for the date of the occurrence of the reassortment event that led to the human strain. According to our results, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Information, the TMRCAs of the eight gene segments from item (1) ranged from September 25, 2013 (95% CI May 28, 2013-January 4, 2014) to January 18, 2014 (95% CI, November 7, 2013-February 7, 2014); the M gene of group A was the earliest gene identified with the TMRCA on September 25, 2013 (95% CI May 28, 2013-January 4, 2014). The TMRCAs of the eight segments from item (2) ranged from April 18, 2010 (95% CI June 26, 2009-November 25, 2010) to August 21, 2013 (95% CI June 6, 2013-October 6, 2013); the N9 gene was the latest gene identified with the TMRCA on August 21, 2013 (95% CI June 6, 2013-October 6, 2013). These results indicated that H7N9 might have been introduced to the patient's farm between August 21, 2013 (95% CI June 6, 2013-October 6, 2013) and September 25, 2013 (95% CI May 28, 2013-January 4, 2014). Considering the dates of the introduction of the seven batches of poultry, the poultry batch acquired in August 2013 represents the likely source of H7N9 introduced to the farm.

However, the process of generating diversified genotypes has not been observed. In this study, reassortment between H7N9 and H9N2 viruses co-circulating on the same farm was documented (Fig. 3). Based on the phylogenetic tree and the similarity analysis of six internal genes, the parental Ck13188-like H7N9 and Ck13200-like H9N2 viruses entered the farm and generated four novel genotypes of H7N9 and one genotype of H9N2, with one of the H7N9 genotypes causing human infection. The unique PA gene of the human isolate was different from the genes of previously reported H7N9 viruses; however, the gene was similar to those of the H9N2 viruses isolated from the patient's farm, further supporting the hypothesis that the virus was generated by reassortment between H7N9 and H9N2 coexisting on the farm. No H7N9 viruses had been reported in Jilin prior to the identification of this human infection. The introduction of H7N9 viruses likely occurred between August 21, 2013 (95% CI June 6, 2013-October 6, 2013) and September 25, 2013 (95% CI May 28, 2013-January 4, 2014). According to the epidemiology data, seven batches of poultry were introduced onto the patient's farm, and the virus most likely entered the farm from the first batch, which included 6 turkeys and 33 guinea fowl (N. meleagris) purchased from an agricultural fair in Changchun City in August 2013. Furthermore, the lack of reports showing H7N9 viruses on other epidemiologically linked farms further supports our conclusion of genetic reassortment.",

Chickens were the most prevalent poultry species on the patient's farm.

The bootstrap method was used to test the phylogeny and was run up to 1,000 times. The time in generations to TMRCA for the eight gene fragments was estimated with the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach in BEAST v1.825 using the SRD06 nucleotide substitution model35. The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model was selected for the rate variation among the branches. A Bayesian skyride was used as a prior coalescent tree, and the UPGMA tree was used as the starting tree. For the prior parameter, ucld.mean and ucld.stdev were set as the uniform distributions; the default values of the other parameters were used. The virus isolates without a detailed sampling date were assigned to the middle of the year/month. The MCMC algorithm was run for 5 \u00d7 107 steps for each dataset, with sampling every 500 steps. Convergence of the parameters was determined as effective sample sizes (ESSs) larger than 200 using Tracer v1.6. The maximum clade credibility trees with median node heights are summarized.",
