It has also been speculated that drugs widely used for hypertension, diabetes and HF \u2013 such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) \u2013 can lead to up-regulation of ACE2 (including at the cardiac level11,12) which could in theory increase susceptibility to the infection.13 However, at present, there is no evidence for this, and there have been very clear statements from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, Heart Failure Society of America and the British Cardiovascular Society that these drugs should not be discontinued.14,15",

Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 results in down-regulation of ACE2, leading to greater production of angiotensin II (which may already be high in patients with HF), since the function of ACE2 is a negative regulator of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) through the inactivation of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1\u20137), a potent vasodilator acting through the Mas receptor.16 Increased angiotensin II may contribute to increased lung permeability17 and may have adverse effects on the myocardium18 (although these would usually be expected to be long term). Thus, up-regulation of ACE2 and blockade of ACE and or angiotensin II receptors could be protective. Again, it must be stressed that such effects are entirely speculative. Clinical trials of recombinant soluble ACE2 are planned and will provide more definitive evidence for the role of ACE2 and the interactions with RAAS-interfering drugs.",
