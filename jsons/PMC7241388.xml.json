The transport sector faces challenges because of climate change, lack of sustainable finance, and various societal pressures such as urbanization and income inequality, and while technological disruption extends the list of challenges, the opportunities of emerging technologies are also vast. In this context, the economics and governance of the transport system may well need reconfiguration to meet the demands of today as well as tomorrow.",

Nonetheless, this issue pursues the planned theme of Transport Research Arena (2020): \u201cRethinking transport \u2013 towards clean and inclusive mobility\u201d. This encompassing theme includes rethinking of economics and governance in the transport sector as we analyze, appraise and develop transport systems.",

Carbon trading has been taken down to individuals in the experiment launched by the City of Lahti in Finland. The technical demonstration of a mobile app that records the carbon release of daily activities is described. It remains to be seen if this type of experiment can be brought to the marketplace and be adopted by citizens. In any case, it is evident that digitalisation offers new possibilities for personal carbon trading and points the way to citizen-led urban transformation.",

Their findings point to the direction where substantial environmental benefits (emissions) and infrastructure benefits (road capacity demand) can be obtained by combining the sharing model and electrification. With sharing, the market penetration rate of electric vehicles can be increased, thus lowering emissions, and both road and parking capacities can be released.",

The model is verified with a case analysis of co-operative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS). Governance and regulation are playing an important role in facilitating new business ecosystems, while the need to control externalities (e.g. emissions, accidents, and social impacts) set new boundaries for creating value. In a complementary article, Lusikka et al. (2020) propose using an open innovation platform and present the case of a living laboratory bus project. The value creation logic is shown in their \u201cvalue ramp\u201d concept.",

In his article, V\u00e4lil\u00e4 (2020) discusses the evidence of PPPs in the light of economic theory. He argues that while there is an abundance of economic theoretical literature on PPPs, the empirical scientific literature is scant.
