            "text": "Neonatal diarrhea is the main cause of death during the first 2 weeks of life in calves (Torsein et al., 2014). Furthermore, diarrhea results in poor growth performance and increases the susceptibility to other infections (Windeyer et al., 2014). Kirchner et al. (2015) recently reported that neonatal diarrhea affects abomasal motility, which consequently delays the abomasal emptying rate (AER) after milk intake. Impaired abomasal motility may increase bacterial fermentation and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Nouri and Constable, 2006), and luminal temperature may rise as a result of bacterial fermentation. The production of SCFAs contributes to the inhibition of abomasal motility by affecting chemoreceptors in the abomasal epithelium (Leek, 1977, Crichlow and Leek, 1986, Crichlow, 1988). In addition, growth of gas-producing bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Sarcina ventriculi, and Lactobacillus spp. is considered to be a predisposing factor for abomasal tympany (Marshall, 2009). SCFAs have been found to impair the sodium transport system of the gastric mucosa of equines under in vitro conditions (Nadeau et al., 2003), leading to an osmotic influx of water into the cells and swelling and degradation of the mucosa (Argenzio, 1999, Carney et al., 1981). Abomasal conditions can be characterized by several intraluminal parameters such as pH, temperature, and abomasal pressure. As previously described, intraluminal pH is determined by invasive methods such as cannulation or through post-mortem study (Bachmann et al., 2009, Constable et al., 2009). A noninvasive wireless ambulatory capsule (WAC) for intraluminal pH, pressure, and temperature measurements has been already described in ponies (Stokes et al., 2012), dogs (Boillat et al., 2010), and humans (Koziolek et al., 2015). To our knowledge, noninvasive WAC measurements have not been described in calves. To investigate the AER, a variety of methods have been used, such as the acetaminophen absorption test (APAT, Constable et al., 2009), D-xylose absorption test (Wittek et al., 2005a, Wittek et al., 2005b), scintigraphic evaluation (Marshall et al., 2005), and ultrasonographic measurements (Sen et al., 2006, Wittek et al., 2005a). In particular, the APAT has been evaluated as an appropriate nonradioactive method in cows (Wittek et al., 2009), heifers (Ehsani-Kheradgerdi et al., 2011), and healthy calves (Constable et al., 2009, Marshall et al., 2005, Sen et al., 2006). Acetaminophen (AAP) is absorbed in the proximal small intestine (Prescott, 1980), and it serves as an accurate parameter of gastric (Snyder et al., 2014) or abomasal emptying in healthy animals (Marshall et al., 2005, Nouri and Constable, 2006, Sen et al., 2006). However, to our knowledge data about diarrheic calves and the AER are lacking.",

A data receiver was fixed on the left side of each calf with an elastic bandage (CoFlex Vet, Andover).

In ponies a mean minimum gastric pressure of 0.0 kPa has been reported (Stokes et al., 2012). In calves, a maximum pressure of 13.1 kPa (98.3 mm Hg) was similar to the mean maximum gastric pressure reported in ponies (126 \u00b1 36 mm Hg; Stokes et al., 2012). Maximum pressure peaks up to 50 kPa were identified as the capsule passed from the stomach into the duodenum in dogs (Boillat et al., 2010), ponies (Stokes et al., 2012), and humans (Koziolek et al., 2015). In our study we did not observe similar maximum pressure peaks because the capsule was not passed from the abomasum into the small intestine either during the observation period of 720 min or at more than 24 days after WAC application (\nFig. 5). However, the median intraluminal pressure tended to be lower in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves; however, the difference was not significant, probably because of the low number of subjects.",

The pH values measured by WAC were similar to postprandial pH values obtained in other studies using calves with an abomasal cannula that were fed either milk or milk replacer (Constable et al., 2005; Sen et al., 2006) or oral rehydration solutions (Sen et al., 2006, Bachmann et al., 2009). The time to pH < 2 was not significantly different in healthy or diarrheic calves. However, times to pH < 2 have been confirmed by other studies in calves fed milk replacer (Sen et al., 2006). It must be emphasized that pH variations depend on the location of the WAC in the abomasum. WACs that are close to the abomasal wall are primarily located in whey and probably experience lower pH values than WACs located in the middle of the chyme, particularly in the curd formation. Furthermore, McLauchlan et al. (1989) found pH differences in the gastric body and antrum in humans due to varied buffering effects of the chyme. The WAC presence in the abomasum was always confirmed by ultrasonography, but the exact location of the WAC in each term was not documented in our study. However, the WAC can be speculated to have been close to the abomasal mucosa in the xiphoidal region given the similar pH trends during the observation period in both groups. Related to the location of the WAC, pH measurements may reflect continuous hydrochloric acid production by the parietal cells of the mucosa and the acidification by the whey. In that context, Constable et al. (2005) reported lower pH values after the intake of cow's milk, which was either a result of the clotting process by the extrusion of low whey pH or by a fast AER, among other possibilities. In the present study, AER was delayed in diarrheic calves, and therefore the location of the WAC in the acidifying whey near the abomasal mucosa might be a possible explanation.",

Afterward, the mean abomasal temperature was higher than the mean rectal temperature in both groups. However, the abomasal temperature of diarrheic calves steadily increased until a mean maximum temperature of 39.6 \u00b0C was reached 9 h postprandial. Higher temperatures were found in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves 7 h after milk replacer intake. One explanation for the higher intraluminal temperatures might be related to fermentation processes in the abomasum. In that context pH-tolerant mucosa-associated Lactobacilli ssp. were recently found by Hund et al. (2014) in the abomasum in calves. One consequence of bacterial fermentation is the production of SCFAs. SCFAs were reported to cause cell edema by interrupting the sodium transport under in vitro conditions in horse gastric tissue (Nadeau et al., 2003). A similar impairment of the sodium transport might also occur in the abomasum; however, data are lacking in the calf. If cell edema impairs the functionality of the abomasal movement, it may lead to delayed abomasal emptying. In addition, we detected pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Rota virus, and Corona virus in all diarrheic calves, and these pathogens are known for their mucosa-injuring potential (Tzipori, 1983, Tzipori et al., 1983).",

As TPP and other parameters such as electrolytes and hematocrit were similar between healthy and diarrheic calves, it can be speculated that calves did not suffer under severe dehydration.

However, no significant differences in Cmax and Tmax were observed between the two groups of calves. The AUC values of diarrheic calves were about 25% lower compared to those of healthy calves, which could also be explained by malabsorption processes in the small intestine.
