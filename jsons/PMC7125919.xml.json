It is customary to say that these are random fluctuations but are they really random? In this respect one can observe that by saying that a phenomenon is random one gives up ipso facto all attempts to understand it. It is probably for this kind of reason that Albert Einstein supported the \u201chidden variable\u201d interpretation of quantum physics. In 1935, i.e. some 10 years after quantum mechanics was introduced, Einstein et al.

While writing his paper Bertillon did not know that some 28 years later there would be a massive influenza pandemic through which his discovery could be tested. We will show below that it was indeed confirmed in all countries where the pandemic has had an impact. Apparently, there has been no further studies of this phenomenon ever since. Actually, even in Bertillon\u2019s paper the effect is discussed fairly briefly. In particular its mechanism remains to be uncovered. This is the purpose of the present paper.",

According to the Bertillon coupling one would expect a trough of births 9 months later that is to say in October or November. Is this indeed the case?

The data are for Sweden. Fig. 1 a shows that the population changes based on the summation of monthly births and deaths approximates correctly the observed annual population changes. The curve of birth numbers based on a constant birth rate is naturally parallel to the population curve; it is displayed in the inset graph of Fig. 1 b; the variation interval of births numbers (as shown on the vertical axis of the inset) is (9.20, 9.45). These variations are much smaller than the actual fluctuations of birth numbers; as a result the broken line of predicted birth numbers looks almost completely flat when displayed on the same graph as the actual births fluctuations.",

An important point is that, as explained in the text, the loss of lives during the death spike cannot by itself account for the observed birth trough. Its direct effect is at least 10 times too small which means that there must also be an indirect effect; it is the purpose of the paper to identify it more closely.",

In Fig. 3 b the birth curve was shifted 8 months to the left and turned upside down (by turning to negative numbers). As a result this new series represents the conceptions (at this point we do not know why the time lag is rather 8 months instead of 9 months). The Bertillon birth effect is clearly visible in the fact that the maximum of the deaths coincides with a minimum of the conceptions. In Fig. 3 b the correlation of the two series is 0.76. A correction was performed on the monthly data so as to give all months the same length of 365\u221512=30.42 days.
