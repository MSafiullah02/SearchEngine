During the acute phase, the principal histologic lesions were degeneration and necrosis of myocytes, myocytolysis, interstitial edema, and hemorrhage. The severity of these changes increased in the subacute phase. Pleural effusion and congestion of the lungs and liver were also present at this time. Myocarditis was detected by day 9 and peaked by day 12. Heart weights and heart weight-to-body weight ratios were increased, and dilation of the right ventricular cavity became prominent early in infection and persisted. In contrast, dilation of the left ventricle occurred late in the subacute stage. Virus was isolated from infected hearts between days 2 and 12. These data suggest that rabbit coronavirus infection progresses to myocarditis and congestive heart failure.",

Pulmonary edema was always present, and accumulations of 10- often present in the thorax. The frequency and volume of pleural effusion increased during the subacute period. Late in the subacute period, a small amount of ascites fluid was seen in some animals. Accentuation of the hepatic lobules was present in some rabbits dying during the subacute period; however, the liver margins remained sharp. Microscopically, myocardial lesions in rabbits dying during the acute phase consisted of widening of intercellular spaces, scattered infiltrates of small numbers of heterophiles (rabbit neutrophils), increased granularity of myocyte cytoplasm, hemorrhage, and occasional degeneration and necrosis of myocytes ( figure 6A) . Only rarely were foci of frank hemorrhage and calcification seen during this period. Lesions were seen equally in the right and left ventricles and in the interventricular septum. As rabbits survived beyond 5 days, lesions progressed in size, number, and maturity. In several rabbits, necrotic foci had varying degrees of calcification ( figure 6B ). Lesions were equally present in the left and right ventricles, interventricular septum, and papillary muscle. No lesions were seen in the heart valves or the vessels. Interstitial edema increased. In addition to increased numbers of heterophils, macrophages and lymphocytes were seen. Myocarditis was usually diffuse to focal and peaked by day 10-12 ( figure 6C ).",

Animals dying in the subacute stage of the disease develop congestion in the lungs and liver, suggesting that a significant percentage of these animals probably die from heart failure. Manifestations of both left-and right-sided heart failure are clearly evident in the subacute phase of infection [4, 6, 7, 21] .

Both viruses have similar isolation histories and antigenic properties and produce similar diseases in vivo. Here we demonstrated that infection with RbCV results in myocarditis. Rabbits normally require 8-10 days to develop a strong lymphocytic infiltration after infection [24] . By the Dallas classification system [25] , focal to diffuse myocarditis with fibrosis is clearly present by day 9 and reaches peak levels on days 10-12. In previous studies, little lymphocytic infiltration was noted because most of the animals dying from RbCV or pleural effusion disease virus infection were examined before day 9 [17, 18, 26] . It seems likely that pleural effusion disease virus infection also results in a significant percentage of animals dying from heart failure, since degeneration and necrosis of myocytes, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, dilated ventricles, and congestion of the lungs, liver, and spleen are common [18, 26] .",

Complications associated with coronavirus infections in humans include myocarditis and perimyocarditis [4] . During the subacute phase of infection, myocardial lesions observed in rabbits closely resemble those of acute myocarditis in humans. Lesions are distributed throughout the ventricles and consist of necrotic fibers surrounded by macrophages and lymphocytes. Adjacent areas of the myocardium appear normal. The endocardium and pericardium are spared. Later, necrotic fibers are replaced with connective tissue or calcification, and the number of macrophages and lymphocytes are reduced [1, 25] .",

Rather, the preponderance of data suggest that cardiac damage is immune-mediated [12, 13, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . The pathogenic mechanisms for myocyte injury after RbCV infection are unclear. Early in infection, significant myocyte damage correlates with high viral titers in the heart and occurs before the presence of significant inflammatory infiltrates. Heterophils and macrophages that are occasionally present early in infection probably represent a nonspecific response to necrotic cell injury. These data suggest that myocardial injury may initially result from direct viral infection, similar to findings reported early in canine parvovirus infection [31] .",
