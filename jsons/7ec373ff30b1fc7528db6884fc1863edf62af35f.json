It seems that patients initially presenting digestive symptoms could have a longer interval from onset to admission and a worse prognosis, as compared to patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. This could be because if doctors rely only on pulmonary signs to raise the suspicion of CoViD-19, they may miss some cases showing, initially, only digestive symptoms. This could delay the diagnosis of the syndrome until the respiratory symptoms appear at an advanced stage (26) . However, at the moment, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited; therefore, further and more detailed investigations are needed before this information is taken for granted.",
