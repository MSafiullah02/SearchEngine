            "text": "In December of 2019, an outbreak of inexplicable pneumonia cases in several patients appeared in Wuhan, China. What is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely since then and, as of this writing, has infected over 1.8 million people worldwide and has claimed the lives of over 100,000 patients [1] . The disease, COVID-19, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), both of which have also been fatal [2] . The number of cases of COVID-19 continues to increase but there is not an approved vaccine or medication that can be used for treatment. Thus, there is an immense need for treatment strategies to help combat this contagious disease. In previous studies, severe patients that have been hospitalized for COVID-19 have had laboratory results that show an increased level of cytokines, specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6) [3]. This increase may be attributed to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that is triggered by a variety of factors such as infections [4] . Since IL-6 plays an important role in CRS, it serves as a possible mechanism of treatment in severe patients. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that has an antagonist effect on the IL-6 receptor. It is currently used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but could also play a key role in treatment for severely ill patients with COVID-19. We performed a systematic review to evaluate outcomes associated with TCZ treatment in patients with COVID-19.",

However, TCZ is FDA approved for adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age or older receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that experience severe or life-threatening CRS [11] . CRS is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a multitude of factors such as infections [12] . Commonly associated with CRS are respiratory symptoms ranging from cough and tachypnea in mild cases to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that includes SOB, hypoxemia, and bilateral opacities on chest x-ray. Mechanical ventilation may be required in some ARDS cases. Similarly, COVID-19 can progress in the same fashion as the respiratory signs and symptoms associated with CRS [13] . Furthermore, elevated markers such as lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, and IL-6 are associated with CRS [12] . Interestingly, these same biomarkers have shown marked elevations in patients with severe cases of COVID-19 [3, 14] . Considering that Luo and colleagues saw more than half of their patients have an elevation followed by gradual reduction in IL-6 levels following TCZ administration, IL-6 can be an important biomarker to trend regarding how well TCZ therapy is working in a COVID-19 patient [5] .",

If the result is positive, TB treatment must be performed prior to administration since TCZ competes with IL-6 at the receptor level leading to reduced macrophage and cytotoxic T-cell differentiation; in turn, TCZ can reduce the antimycobacterial activity of IL-6 [15] . Also, patients should be monitored for TB while receiving treatment with TCZ. However, COVID-19 patients can deteriorate quickly where a latent TB test may not be possible prior to treatment. Data from a large number of clinical trials has shown that the risk for latent TB reactivation is very low or absent where the benefit of administering TCZ may outweigh this risk [15] . Furthermore, patients should be monitored for neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal lipid tests while on TCZ [11] . Patients with increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation should be monitored while on TCZ. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur while on TCZ and therapy may need to be Table 1 Retrospective analyses involving the use of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19.",

Important questions that remain are related to whether TCZ can be used to prevent CRS from occurring in patients with COVID-19, identifying eligible patient characteristics that are likely to respond to TCZ, optimal TCZ dosing, and considerations for combination therapy with steroids or other cytokine inhibitors. Current guidance from both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) make no recommendation for or against the use of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19; however, both the IDSA and ATS agree that tocilizumab in the context of a clinical trial is worthwhile [16, 17] .",
