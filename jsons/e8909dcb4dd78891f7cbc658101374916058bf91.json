At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American healthcare industry watched from television screens thinking \"this will not reach us.\" And yet as of March 26th, the United States now surpasses both China and Italy in total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases 1 . With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (2010), we have been compelled to adopt the concept of population health and embrace responsibility for the healthcare outcomes of our respective populations. Like many organizations, rural healthcare systems have incrementally transitioned to such a paradigm. Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, it is evident that perhaps we must reach dire circumstances in order to realize population health management is truly our reality. Thus, our institution has implemented a broad range of system-wide changes to curtail the spread of this outbreak and anticipate the upcoming needs of the patients we serve.",

This screening process evolved over time as more information about the virus became available and national recommendations changed. It began with limiting access for individuals who had recently travelled to China. Screening was then expanded to include individuals who either had a personal travel history or had been in contact with persons who had recently travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Initially, screening only occurred in areas containing our most susceptible patients -the ICU and oncology wing. This transitioned to our current practice of closing all entrances except two, where all entering individuals are required to have their temperature checked via an infrared thermometer and answer a screening questionnaire. Those with temperatures above a designated cutoff undergo a medical workup and are not allowed into patient areas. Visitation has been incrementally restricted to only allow visitors under exceptional circumstances.",

Therefore, our organization has significantly limited the number of in-person clinic visits. Annual physicals, routine screenings, and immunizations have been postponed. Long term, this may be detrimental to patient care and the patient-provider relationship. One means to mediate this impact is through expansion of telehealth. In the past, only post-operative virtual visits were reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid. However, with the recent approval for telehealth expansion by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, our organization began utilizing telehealth during routine office visits, as well as uncomplicated post-operative visits and certain new patient encounters. It is our hope that a substantial portion of outpatient care may continue via this mechanism. At present, we have 252 providers actively performing remote office visits with a total of 415 now having access to the platform. This is compared with only 12 providers previously utilizing the telehealth system (Figure 1 and 2) . This remarkable increase in telehealth providers was accomplished within 10 days, and activity is expected to markedly grow in the coming weeks.",

One such addition includes the development of surgical cases for medical students that contain patient encounters spanning from office visits, to pre-operative testing, intra-operative decision making, inpatient post-operative care, and outpatient follow up.

However, who decides which cases qualify as urgent or emergent? Some guidelines trying to address this concern have been published by national societies such as the American College of Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [11] [12] . However, these guidelines leave significant room for interpretation. Therefore, many hospitals have allowed their operating surgeons a certain amount of clinical discretion in what constitutes an elective procedure. While one would hope clinical judgement and professional responsibility remain intact during this time, when faced with patients requiring surgical intervention, decisions to postpone care are not easily made. Such decisions would perhaps be more straightforward with specific guidance from informed and well-respected sources.",

One proposition allows early graduation of medical students. Indeed, this has already been implemented in Italy, the United Kingdom, and New York [13] [14] [15] . With the advent of new providers entering the workforce and current providers serving in specialties other than which they were trained, we must ensure the quality of care we provide our patients remains high. It will be vital, now more than ever, to maintain appropriate oversight of these individuals by clinicians experienced in their field -both to maintain high-quality training for new providers and to continue the safe, effective, and reliable care our patients have come to expect.",
