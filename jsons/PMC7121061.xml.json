ACE2 is also a receptor for the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3]. Although ACE2 is found in many tissues, it is highly expressed in the kidney, particularly within cells of the proximal tubule [4, 5]. Because it decreases levels of the vasoconstrictor Ang II and generates the vasodilator Ang-(1-7), ACE2 may protect against hypertension [6] and renal disease [7, 8]. ACE2 has also been shown to prevent acute lung injury\n[9].",

In this chapter, we describe a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 enzyme activity in biological fluids using a commercially available synthetic fluorogenic substrate for ACE2.

The linear equations generated for human and mouse rACE2 are used to convert the RFU to ACE2 concentrations in human or mouse biological fluids, respectively. In our hands, the RFU signal reaches saturation when the rACE2 concentration is greater than 50 ng/ml. The RFU signal becomes very weak or undetectable when the rACE2 concentration is less than 1.56 ng/ml. This range approximates the detection limits for human ACE2 using a commercial ELISA, which we previously reported to range from 0.39 to 25 ng/ml [13].\n",

In this regard, Pedersen et al. [16] measured the dissociation constant (Ki) between DX600 and human or mouse ACE2 in activity assays with the same ACE2 substrate, and reported the Ki for human ACE2 to be significantly lower (0.040 \u00b1 0.005 \u03bcM) than the Ki for mouse ACE2 (0.36 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM), suggesting that DX600 has higher affinity for human ACE2. The inhibitory effect of another commercially available conformational variant of DX600 (cyclic form) on ACE2 has not yet been tested in our assay. However, Ye et al. have reported that the disulfide bridged cyclic variant of DX600 (Bachem) had no inhibitory effect on mouse or rat ACE2, even at high concentrations, but effectively inhibited human rACE2\n[17].",

Indeed, a highly linear relationship between the ACE2 activity (RFU) and mouse rACE2 concentration is observed for both concentrations of MLN-4760 (R\n2 = 0.9950, p < 0.001 for 10\u22125 M; R\n2 = 0.9954, p < 0.001 for 10\u22126 M). In contrast, DX600 has no significant inhibitory effect on mouse rACE2 activity even at concentrations as high as 10\u22125 M. Similarly, two groups have reported that 10\u22126 M DX600 (purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA, USA) only partly (and ineffectively) blocks mouse recombinant or mouse kidney ACE2 activity [16, 17]. However, significant inhibition of mouse ACE2 has been observed with DX600 at 10\u22125 M using an assay buffer maintained at pH 6.5 (16). In rat PT segments, we have used the linear form of DX600 (10\u22126 M) (obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) to demonstrate inhibition of Ang-(1- 7) formation from Ang-(1\u201310), suggesting inhibition of rat ACE2 [5]. In rat kidney cortex, Ye et al. showed that DX600 (10\u22126 M) only partly inhibited ACE2 activity, measured at pH 6.5 [17]. Accordingly, because of the relatively poor inhibition of rodent ACE2 by DX600, for mouse biological samples we use 10\u22126 M of MLN-4760 for all experiments. For the ACE2 activity assay in human biological fluids, either MLN-4760 or DX600 can be used.\n",

We have addressed this question by measuring ACE2 activity at different time points (2, 6, 16, and 24 h incubation), with mouse rACE2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 ng/ml (Fig. 4a). A time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity is observed for all mouse rACE2 concentrations. By 16 h of incubation, the RFU signal has reached saturation for mouse rACE2 concentrations between 100 and 200 ng/ml. The linear detection range for ACE2 with 16 h incubation is between 1.56 and 50 ng/ml (Fig. 4b). In contrast, for a 2 h incubation time, a linear relationship still exists between ACE2 activity and ACE2 concentration for mouse rACE2 between 100 and 200 ng/ml (Fig. 4a). Thus, the detection limit of the assay for 2 h incubation is extended between 1.56 and 200 ng/ml (R\n2 = 0.9981, p < 0.001), although RFU values are significantly lower at all ACE2 concentrations (see Fig. 4). In our lab, we routinely select 16 h as an incubation time for the assay, since ACE2 activity in most biologic samples we have studied is within the 16 h detection limit (i.e., up to 50 ng/ml).

In preliminary data, we also found that incubation of mouse PT cells with high glucose concentrations enhances ACE2 activity in the culture medium, suggesting increased shedding of ACE2 from the cell membrane (data not shown). Accordingly, we have determined if high glucose concentrations alone can affect the assay. As shown in Fig. 5a, ACE2 activity in mouse PT cell culture medium with a high d\n-glucose concentration (25 mM) is not significantly different from that in the same medium with a normal d\n-glucose concentration (7.8 mM) (p > 0.05, n = 3).\n",
