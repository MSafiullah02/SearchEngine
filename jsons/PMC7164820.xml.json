At present, guidelines do not recommend antibiotics for treatment of early asthma-like episodes,10 yet they are widely used.4 We did a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of azithromycin for treatment of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in young children who were followed up prospectively in our new unselected Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC2010) birth cohort.11\n",

We searched PubMed up to Oct 15, 2010, with no language limits, for various combinations of the search terms \u201cRCT\u201d, \u201cchildhood\u201d, \u201casthma\u201d, \u201cwheeze\u201d, and \u201cantibiotics\u201d. We identified all previous randomised controlled trials of treatment with antibiotics for asthma and wheezy exacerbations, but focused mainly on childhood asthma. The search led us to new articles, but also identified other relevant old publications for background material. Investigators of two randomised trials concluded no beneficial effect of \u03b2-lactam treatment for acute exacerbations, which has led to present guidelines not recommending antibiotic treatment for episodes of acute asthma-like symptoms.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial of azithromycin treatment of acute episodes of asthma-like symptoms in children aged 1\u20133 years with a history of recurrent episodes and its findings show a clinically significant shortening of symptom duration by 63% after intervention.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nPresent guidelines do not recommend antibiotics for treatment of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, yet antibiotics remain among the most commonly prescribed drugs in these episodes. Our findings suggest that azithromycin might be beneficial after medical assessment of an acute asthma-like episode in young children with a known history of such symptoms and without clinical signs of pneumonia. How the effect of azithromycin is compared with narrow-spectrum antibiotics and whether long-term effects are associated with recurrent use of azithromycin need to be investigated.\n",

Such strict diagnostic procedure is paramount to clinical assessments, diagnoses, and treatments, which are otherwise poorly standardised in the community and more difficult in young children than later in life.13 The in-depth clinical assessment of each respiratory episode by the study paediatrician before randomisation, including a thorough objective examination and CRP concentration measurement in the research clinic, ensured validity and homogeneity of the primary outcome and exclusion of children with clinical signs of pneumonia. This assessment minimised the possibility of the azithromycin effect being driven by treatment of bacterial pneumonia misclassified as an episode of asthma-like symptoms.",

Furthermore, most children (more than 80%) had undetectable concentrations of CRP and no fever at randomisation, and the treatment effect was similar in these children, strongly suggesting that the effect of azithromycin is not due to misclassification of pneumonia. Azithromycin treatment was particularly effective in children who were treated shortly after symptom debut. This finding makes us speculate that azithromycin is mainly acting on the acute inflammatory24 or infectious6, 25 processes related to exacerbations, rather than a persistent underlying inflammation. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of effect on time to next episode. Alternatively, azithromycin acts by clearing bacterial pathogens indirectly responsible for the respiratory episode through subsequent co-infection by a viral trigger, and therefore the treatment was more effective when initiated early in the episode than when initiated late.26\n",

Our finding in this study that the treatment effect was strong, even in episodes for which no bacterial pathogen was detected, suggests that the effect of azithromycin is not only antibacterial. Macrolide antibiotics are active against both common airway pathogenic bacteria and atypical bacteria,27, 28, 29 but also have anti-inflammatory activity24 and, possibly, antiviral effects.30 Studies of macrolides in adults with severe asthma episodes are ambiguous,31, 32 and macrolides reportedly reduce exacerbations in adults with an asthma type characterised by chronic neutrophilic inflammation.33, 34 Indeed, recurrent asthma-like symptoms in young children are also characterised by neutrophilic inflammation,25, 35, 36 which, in particular, might be present for episodes triggered by H influenzae.34 This corresponds with our finding of a stronger azithromycin effect in episodes triggered by H influenzae. Viral infection in general did not predict an altered effect of azithromycin treatment. Low numbers in some viral species groups limit the conclusions drawn about effect modification by specific viruses. Thus, the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral pathways of azithromycin could have contributed to the shortening of episode length observed in this study. We cannot rule out that the effects noted are mainly anti-inflammatory because episodes triggered by H influenzae induce neutrophilic inflammation34 and azithromycin also reduced episode duration in children without any evidence of bacterial infection. An RCT37 of treatment with azithromycin in RSV-positive children showed a reduction of the neutrophilic marker interleukin 8 at day 14 after azithromycin treatment. This finding could point towards an anti-inflammatory effect as the primary mediator of our findings and also explain why findings from previous RCTs38, 39 have failed to show treatment effects of non-anti-inflammatory antibiotics in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.",

We are keenly aware of the potential ecological issues relating to use of antibiotics in terms of bacterial ecology and resistance. Macrolide resistance in organisms causing respiratory illness in children is already an issue.40 Future research should establish the choice of antimicrobial treatment and criteria for treatment, taking societal aspects into consideration. We did not identify strong effect modifiers from the objective clinical measures, concomitant treatments, or the microbiological profile other than the presence of H influenzae.
