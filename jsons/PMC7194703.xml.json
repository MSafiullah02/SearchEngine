While usually infecting animals [2], [3], some coronaviruses cause infections in humans [4]. The most commonly associated symptoms are fever, cough, asthenia realizing a flu-like syndrome [5], [6]. However, two coronaviruses have led to serious epidemics in humans: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that emerged in China 2002\u20132003 [7], [8] and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [9]. Similarly to these two coronavirus, the Covid-19 also called the SARS-CoV-2 has probably animal origin [10].",
