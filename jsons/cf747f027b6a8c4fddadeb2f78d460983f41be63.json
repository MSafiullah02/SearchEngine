Treatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per milliliter reduces viral titers by 3.4 log or over 4 log, respectively, in Vero cells. The EC 50 of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding which could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.",

Humans produce 13 types of IFN-\u03b1 and a singular IFN-\u03b2 (Pestka et al., 2004) . Type I IFNs ultimately induces a number of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) which encode for a variety of antiviral effectors . Notably, IFN-\u03b2 production leads to a positive feedback loop that further stimulates the expression of many of the IFN\u03b1 genes (Honda et al., 2006) . Clinically, Type I IFNs have already been approved for use in the treatment of certain cancers, autoimmune disorders, and viral infections (hepatitis B and hepatitis C). Importantly, type I IFNs are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat MERS-CoV and therefore have been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 but without evidence from laboratory testing against SARS-CoV-2 (Sallard et al., 2020) . We assessed the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in vitro. Herein, we report that type I IFNs exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in cultured cells, demonstrating the therapeutic potency of type I IFNs for COVID-19.",

Our data clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 treatment in cultured cells, which is comparable to the IFN-sensitive VSV. Our discovery reveals a weakness of the new coronavirus, which may be informative to antiviral development. The experiment was performed in the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene-defective Vero cells (Desmyter et al., 1968) . It is plausible that in IFN-competent cells the efficacy of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection is more potent, as IFN-\u03b2 upregulates other subtypes of Type I IFN expression and augments the IFN-mediated antiviral response (Honda et al., 2006) . It is also important to evaluate the antiviral effects of IFNs further in pathobiologically relevant human cell types. Our data may provide an explanation, at least in part, to the observation that approximately 80% of patients actually develop mild symptoms and recover (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . It is possible that many of them are able to mount IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated innate immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, which helps to limit virus infection/dissemination at an early stage of disease. At a later stage, the adaptive immune response (antibody etc.) may eventually help patients recover from the COVID-19 disease.",

            "text": "Compared to SARS-CoV-2, it seems that SARS-CoV is relatively less sensitive to IFN treatment in vitro (Dahl et al., 2004; Moriguchi and Sato, 2003) . One study reported that the EC 50 of IFN-\u03b2 for SARS-CoV is 95 or 105 IU/ml depending on virus strains (Cinatl et al., 2003) . Many other highly pathogenic viruses are also resistant to exogenous IFN treatment. For Ebola virus, it has been reported that treatment with exogenous IFN-\u03b1 does not affect viral replication and infectious virus production in cultured cells (Kash et al., 2006) , probably as a result of antagonism of the IFN response by viral protein. Jun\u00edn virus, an arenavirus that causes Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever, is likewise insensitive to IFN treatment: when treated with a high concentration of human IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b3 (1000 U/ml), the titers of JUNV were reduced by less than 1-log in Vero cells (Huang et al., 2012) . The antiviral function of type I IFNs are mediated by a spectrum of ISGs, including PKR, OASs, Mx proteins and RIG-I, which collectively reinforce virus detection and inhibition of viral replication, viral protein synthesis, and the assembly and release of progeny virus particles . The apparently higher sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV suggests that the new coronavirus is more susceptible to ISG-mediated antiviral activities. Another possibility is that the new coronavirus may be less capable in suppressing IFN production and/or signaling than SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV encodes several IFN antagonists, including the structural protein NP and M protein Lu et al., 2011; Siu et al., 2009) , nonstructural protein nsp1 (Huang et al., 2011; Kamitani et al., 2006 Kamitani et al., , 2009 Narayananj et al., 2008) , nonstructural protein nsp3 (Devaraj et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012) , and the accessory protein ORF3b, ORF6, ORF8a and 8 ab (Freundt et al., 2009; Frieman et al., 2007; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2008b; Wong et al., 2018) . These SARS-CoV proteins are shown to suppress type I IFN production and the JAK/STAT IFN signaling pathway. The amino acid identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV counterparts are 91% (M), 94% (NP), 84% (nsp1), 76% (nsp3), 69% (ORF6) and 40% (ORF8) (Chan et al., 2020) . For SARS-CoV-2, whether or not these putative IFN antagonists can interfere with IFN response, and to what extent if any, remains to be investigated. SARS-CoV-2 apparently does not encode ORF3b. Expression of SARS-CoV ORF3b has been shown to block IFN production and STAT1-mediated IFN signaling and also induce AP-1 transcriptional activity (Varshney and Lal, 2011) . Further work is warranted to investigate the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection to better understand the underlying mechanism behind its IFN sensitivity.",
