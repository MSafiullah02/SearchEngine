            "text": "At the end of December 2019, a series of viral pneumonia cases caused by an unidentified microbial agent emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A novel betacoronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) [[1], [2], [3]]. By March 26, 2020, there were 469938 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases globally, and an additional 81985 cases suspected in China have been reported. On March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. Symptoms resulting from COVID-19 include fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, diarrhoea and vomiting, which are similar to those of the regular human flu [[2], [3], [4]]. Anecdotal evidence suggested that some patients were asymptomatic [3,4]. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is one of the major imaging modalities according to World Health Organization and CDC guidelines [5]. The typical findings from chest CT images of patients are bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity [2,[6], [7], [8]]. However, the early imaging features of COVID-19 infection are not typical. We aimed to describe the early CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia based on an isolated lesion on initial CT scans. Thus far, this information has not been previously reported. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the isolated lesion on the first positive CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, we presented temporal lung changes in the follow-up chest CT scans.",

All patients had recent travel history to or lived in Wuhan, China (the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak). Certain patients had contact with other patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients underwent CT for fever or other symptoms including cough, myalgia, fatigue, vomiting or diarrhoea. All cases were later confirmed with a positive result to real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, with throat or nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

The average CTDIvols were 2.37 \u00b1 1.11 mGy, DLPs were 93.89 \u00b1 45.61 mGy.cm, and the effective dose after ICRP guideline was 2.01 \u00b1 0.67 mSv for each CT scan. Longitudinal changes in speci\ufb01c abnormalities were documented in 20 patients with serial scans obtained in the 2nd week (8-14days), in 14 patients with serial scans obtained in the 3rd weeks (15-21 days) and in 7 patients in the 4th weeks or later (22-31days)after the onset. At 3 to 14 days after the onset of initial symptoms, the lesions were larger and expanding, and new lesions were observed at 6 to 14 days after onset of all patients, which might indicate a progressive stage. Diffuse lesions in most lobes (white lung) were observed at 9 days after onset in one patient (Fig. 6c,d). In 7-31 days after onset, the lesions were gradually absorbed and became irregularly linear and reticular structure, and were even completely absorbed in two patients (Fig. 5). However, the absorbed lesions were accompanied by new lesions at 10-18 days. After 10 day (the 2nd week), 12 (60%) of 20 patients had irregular linear opacities with or without associated ground-glass opacity or consolidation. Mixed and predominantly reticular patterns were noted from the 14th day in 7 of 20 patients (45%). At 22-31 days after the onset of initial symptoms, the lesions were completely absorbed in only 2 of 7 patients (28.57%, Fig. 7\n). Of 16 in whom the isolated lesion was located the central region on the first CT, 12 cases (75%) showed involvement of the central and perihilar regions by expanding on the follow-up chest CT (Fig. 3).",

We found that the typical early pulmonary CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia were ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation, predominantly located peripheral or subpleural location with pulmonary artery dilation and air bronchogram. However, the early image performance of some cases of the COVID-19 infection is not typical. Sixteen of 46 isolated lesions (34.78%) were located in the central region. In total, 12 of 16 cases (75%) showed involvement of the central and perihilar regions by expanding on the follow-up chest CT. A halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule was observed in 12 of 46 patients. Pleural effusion was uncommon. No cavitation, calci\ufb01cation or lymphadenopathy was found in this study. In our cases, five lesions had sizes less than 10 mm. We advised that the small lesions, and especially new lesions, that contained an area of ground-glass opacity required follow-up to eliminate the possibility of COVID-19 pneumonia in these high-risk groups. Particularly, it should be noted that two cases in this study were negative on the first CT and positive on the follow-up CT. Therefore, CT re-examination might be recommended for the high-risk population with a history of epidemic condition exposure. We hope that our study findings can help to ensure triage and early recognition of the COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Although lesion development progressed in a time-dependent manner, we observed that at 3 to 14 days after disease onset, patients exhibited increased lung involvement accompanied by lesion enlargement and expansion, or new lesions were observed, indicating a potential progressive stage of the infection. This stage might be critical for treatment intervention and requires close clinical observations. During the reconstruction stage, which occurred at 7 to 31 days after disease onset in our studies, the lesions were absorbed and formed irregular linear opacities. In further analysis, we found that the lesions were absorbed but that patients developed new lesions at 10-18 days. Additionally, mixed and predominantly reticular patterns were noted from 14 day in 7 of 20 patients (45%) and the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients(28.57%)within 22-31 days after the onset of initial symptoms. Long-term follow-up with CT and concomitant functional studies are required to determine the long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia. Several studies have suggested that COVID-19 enters into host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) [[13], [14], [15]], and excessive activation of immune cells leads to the production of a large number of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, causing diffuse damage to pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelium. Though with meticulous treatments, it takes a time for the immune response to build and produce antibodies to suppress virus replication. A large sample study is needed to establish the evolution mechanism of CT characteristics during the disease.",
