The fatality occurred in a 2-year-old Sudanese refugee child who had resettled in 2000 to this community with her mother and siblings from a refugee camp in Egypt. The family resided in an apartment in a tenement building that was constructed in the 1920s. Approximately 8 weeks following resettlement, this child acquired an EBLL of 391 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. The CDC's action level in 2000 was 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Hence, this child's EBLL was 39 times above CDC's action level at that time. An environmental and epidemiological investigation determined that due to the child's exposure to lead paint dust and chips in the apartment she lived in with her family and her underlying conditions of pica (a craving for nonfood substances) and malnutrition resulted in her acquiring an EBLL in a short period of time. The child died as a result of complications triggered by the EBLL (Caron et al. 2001) .",

Due to the older housing stock in the community that contains lead paint, the CDC named the community and its surrounding towns as a universal screening site. This means that every child at 1 and 2 years of age must be screened for exposure to lead ). This is a form of secondary prevention. The Gold Standard is primary prevention where exposure to lead would not occur in the first place, thus the risk is removed from the environment. To achieve primary prevention of CLP, lead paint would need to be abated from every apartment unit in the city. However, this is a costly process that the municipality or property owners/managers are unable to afford. Yet, there are many families with lead-poisoned children who would argue that the benefits of primary prevention outweigh the costs.",

It is not feasible to provide translation services for every dialect. How would you educate about a serious public health issue, such as CLP, for which there are no visible signs or symptoms until there is an EBLL? 3. Does the community have a plan to address this public health issue? Has the community, who lives with the issue (i.e., refugees, \"working poor\"), been invited to participate with public health practitioners? Is there a community coalition formed to work on monitoring the issue and connecting families with testing services? How would you establish such a community group if one does not exist? 4. How would you partner with an academic institution with public health expertise to assist with providing knowledge, expertise, and resources? 5.

If a stakeholder refuses to come to the \"table\" to work on the issue because they believe the issue is either not under their purview or is too complex to address, how would you engage this key partner? 9. Policies pertaining to lead paint in housing and occupancy vary from state to state. How would you amend the current (if any) lead housing policies in your community or state? Would public health enforcement laws be necessary (i.e., citations for property owners who do not comply with the developed policy)? Whom would you work with to develop and enact such policies? 10.

Of the initial four patients diagnosed with HCV, one of the individuals was a traveling medical technician in the cardiac catheterization laboratory of the hospital. Further investigation by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) revealed that the cause of the outbreak was drug diversion (\"\u2026the stealing of narcotic pain medication intended for patients for self use\"; NHDHHS 2013, p. 6) by the infected medical technician.",

Persons who have mental illness are overrepresented among both those who are prescribed opioids and those who overdose on them. (CDC 2012a, p. 774) Of those who are prescribed opioid analgesics, the populations of greatest concern are those who seek care from multiple physicians and potentially take advantage of the physician's sensitivity to the patient's pain management (CDC 2012a). It is this population that is estimated to not only comprise approximately 40 % of overdose cases on opioid analgesics but also are diverting drugs for self-use or providing them to others (CDC 2012a). Thus, the CDC recommends that prevention efforts should focus on addressing the following target populations: patients who consume opioid analgesics in high doses and those who seek care from multiple physicians and receive high doses of opioid analgesics. This latter group is likely to be involved in drug diversion (CDC 2012a). Inciardi et al. (2009) report that the primary populations involved in drug diversion include \"\u2026drug dealers, friends and relatives, smugglers, pain patients, and the elderly, but these vary by the population being targeted\" (p. 332).",

For example, with humans, physicians often prescribe an antibiotic when one is not needed and/or the patient does not complete the entire course of antibiotic treatment. Thus, \"\u2026up to 50 % of all antibiotics prescribed for people are not needed or are not optimally effective as prescribed\" (CDC 2013a, p. 11). Antibiotic resistance can occur both within and outside of health-care facilities, yet deaths related to antibiotic resistance are most common in the healthcare setting (CDC 2013a). Furthermore, Antibiotics are also commonly used in food animals to prevent, control, and treat disease, and to promote the growth of food-producing animals. The use of antibiotics for promoting growth is not necessary, and the practice should be phased out. (CDC 2013a, p. 11) Antibiotic resistance is not only a public health problem in the USA but it also presents as a major public health problem on a global scale. The statistics that demonstrate the magnitude of this public health issue on a national scale are staggering:",

(CDC 2013a, p. 18) Thus, these statistics could be significantly higher. Moreover, the health-care burden this preventable public health issue creates is multifaceted and can include the following cost-related issues for the health-care system: \u2026prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extend hospital stays, necessitate additional doctor visits and healthcare use, and result in greater disability and death compared with infections that are easily treatable with antibiotics. (CDC 2013a, p. 11) These health-care costs are estimated to be in excess of US$20 billion and societal costs due to a loss of productivity are estimated to be US$35 billion a year (Roberts et al. 2009) . A further complication of antibiotic resistance is seen in those populations who have underlying disease, such as diabetes, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. These groups, in addition to those patients who may undergo chemotherapy, organ and bone marrow transplant surgery, joint replacement surgery, or end-stage renal disease are significantly dependent on antibiotic use to fight off infections (CDC 2013a). These subgroups represent a susceptible population to infection especially if antibiotics that are heavily relied upon do not work optimally for these patients.",
