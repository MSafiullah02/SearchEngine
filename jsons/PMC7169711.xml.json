Unfortunately, the ensuing years were disappointing in this regard. Nevertheless, with the advent of RNAi, the number of active clinical trials with therapeutic oligonucleotides has grown enormously. According to some estimates, 80% of all therapeutic targets are not \u2018druggable\u2019 with small molecules or protein\u2010based therapies making RNAi mediators very attractive. Unlike traditional small drug or protein\u2010based approaches, any disease\u2010causing gene and any cell type or tissue can potentially be targeted with RNAi mediators if delivery were not a major limitation.",

Of these, 88.2% are synthetic nucleic acids. Table 1 shows a listing of the 11 companies that have active RNAi mediator drug programs in clinical trials.

Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic, ALN\u2010RSV01, was designed to target the conserved N gene of the RSV genome, critical for the replication of the virus. Since initiating the ALN\u2010RSV01 therapeutic program in 2005, Alnylam has made rapid progress. Alnylam has licensed intellectual property from the University of South Alabama,43,44 covering RNAi compositions and methods of treating pulmonary viral infections with siRNAs. The company has also formed an exclusive alliance with Kyowa Hakko to develop and commercialize ALN\u2010RSV01 in Japan and other major markets in Asia. In February 2008, Alnylam announced that it had achieved human proof of concept with ALN\u2010RSV01, the first for the industry. Results from the company's GEMINI trial with ALN\u2010RSV01 showed statistically significant antiviral efficacy. GEMINI was a randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind Phase II trial in 88 healthy adult volunteers experimentally inoculated with RSV. Intranasal ALN\u2010RSV01 administered once a day for 5 days (2 days prior to and 3 days following viral infection) gave a 37.1% reduction in infection rate as measured by plaque assay, and similar significant reductions as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), spin\u2010enhanced culture and RSV antigen assay. There was a 95% increase in the number of patients remaining free of infection (24/43 on ALN\u2010RSV01 vs. 12/42 on placebo). Viral load, peak viral load, duration of viral shedding, and mean daily viral load all showed consistent trends favoring an ALNRSV01 treatment effect. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms. ALN\u2010RSV01 was safe and well tolerated. In April 2008, Alnylam initiated a Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of aerosolized ALN\u2010RSV01 versus placebo in adult lung transplant patients naturally infected with RSV. Those receiving ALN\u2010RSV01 will have the drug administered by inhalation via nebulizer, which is the expected delivery formulation for commercialization. As a secondary objective, this trial will be the first to evaluate the antiviral activity of ALN\u2010RSV01 in a naturally acquired RSV lower respiratory tract infection.",

ALN\u2010VSP02 targets two key genes each involved in the disease pathway of liver cancer: kinesin spindle protein (KSP) and VEGF. It is thought that the dual\u2010target approach increases the potential for a significant therapeutic benefit for cancer treatment. In preclinical studies, ALN\u2010VSP demonstrated the ability to silence both tumor KSP and VEGF and stopped the proliferation of cancer cells. In these studies, ALN\u2010VSP02 showed a striking reduction in the growth and number of significant tumor masses in the liver. Data reported at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer demonstrated robust efficacy in an orthotopic liver tumor model, including the inhibition of tumor growth as measured by serum levels of alpha\u2010fetoprotein (AFP) and a significant survival benefit. Specific silencing of KSP and VEGF for ALN\u2010VSP02 was demonstrated, and an RNAi mechanism of action toward both target gene mRNAs was confirmed. In late 2008, an investigational new drug (IND) application for ALN\u2010VSP02 was submitted to the U.S. FDA and accepted. A Phase I clinical trial titled \u2018Dose Escalation Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous ALN\u2010VSP02 in patients with advanced solid tumors with liver involvements\u2019 is enrolling an estimated 58 people (http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=642288 ).",

The targeting agent contains the human transferrin protein. The cationic polymer (cyclodextran) interacts electrostatically with anionic siRNA to assemble into nanocomplexes below approximately 100 nm in diameter that protect the siRNA from nuclease degradation in serum. The siRNA\u2010containing nanocomplexes are targeted to cells that over\u2010express the TfR. Upon reaching a target cell, transferrin binds to TfRs on the cell surface and the siRNA\u2010containing nanocomplex enters the cell by endocytosis. Inside the cell, chemistry built into the polymer achieves unpackaging of the siRNA from the nanocomplex, permitting it to function via RNA interference.46 The surface\u2010modifying agents have terminal adamantane groups that form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin and contain polyethylene glycol (PEG) to endow the particles with properties that prevent aggregation, enhance stability, and enable systemic administration. Ligands to cell surface receptors can be covalently attached to the adamantane\u2010PEG modifier, enabling the siRNA\u2010containing particles to be targeted to tissues of interest. Workers at Caltech and Children's Hospital located in Los Angeles have also used nanoparticles made with Calando's delivery system and siRNA against the EWS\u2010Fli1 fusion gene to prevent tumor growth in a disseminated murine model of Ewing's sarcoma.47,48 Treatments were made using female Non\u2010obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice injected with luciferase\u2010expressing TC71 (human Ewing's sarcoma) cells at siRNA doses of 2.5 mg/kg. Doses were administered weekly twice for 4 weeks. Each treatment group contained 10 mice. Safety evaluations are ongoing, as well as additional efficacy studies in animal models.

Santaris is using interspersed locked nucleic acid combinations along with a phosphorothioate backbone which acts by sequestering miRNA in the cytoplasm.49 Despite this opportunity, there will be numerous challenges that an miRNA\u2010based drug would have to overcome as every miRNA can target multiple genes and influence tens or hundreds of biological pathways. The number of safety concerns that will have to be addressed will be significant. Another issue will be choosing the right miRNA to target. Recently, there has been a growing body of evidence that suggest a link between the miRNA profile of a cell and its oncogenic potential. A more lucid picture of the role miRNAs play in cancer will likely come forward once efforts to examine the cancer genome reveal the number of mutations in miRNAs and their protein\u2010coding gene target sequences.",

            "text": "Conjugation of siRNA molecules to a targeting molecule is a promising means of delivery.50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 The conjugate is usually formed through a covalent attachment of the targeting molecule to the passenger strand of the RNAi mediator, so as not to disrupt silencing activity. Conjugation is an attractive approach because of the wide variety of potential targeting moieties, including nucleic acid or peptide aptamers, cell permeable peptides, antibodies, and natural molecules such as cholesterol which would be expected to have low toxicity.52,56,57 Antibody\u2010based siRNA delivery is an active area of investigation. In the immunoliposome approach, siRNA\u2010containing liposomes are chemically coupled to antibodies to form immunoliposome\u2010siRNA complexes.58, 59, 60 After injection, the complexes bind to surface antigens and the liposomes fuse with the cell membrane and deliver siRNA into cells. An alternative antibody\u2010based approach uses modified antibody\u2010fusion proteins, which have distinct antigen\u2010 and RNA\u2010binding domains.61,62 In theory, after the siRNA\u2010fusion protein complex is injected into the animal it binds the target cells and is subsequently internalized by receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis. The RNAi mediator should then dissociate from the targeting delivery vehicle, exit the endosome, enter the cytoplasm and enter the RNAi silencing protein complex where it is used to induce gene silencing.63, 64, 65, 66 For all of this to take place, a fine balance of siRNA affinity for the carrier is needed so that siRNA can be released upon entering the endosome.",

Recombinant fusion immunoconjugates (r\u2010FIs) have distinct antigen\u2010 and RNA\u2010binding domains fused into one protein unit. Prior to delivery the RNAi mediator is mixed with the r\u2010FI and forms a non\u2010covalent complex with the RNA\u2010binding domain of the fusion complex. The siRNA\u2010r\u2010FI complex is now in a form to be injected into an animal model and bind target cells. After subsequent receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, the siRNA dissociates from the r\u2010FI and interacts with the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly.61 In the research paper by Song and colleagues, a gene encoding the nucleic acid binding protein was fused to the gene encoding a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp160 (env) protein. The Fab\u2010protamine fusion protein is then loaded with siRNA and used to selectively deliver the siRNA into cells expressing the env gene. Recombinant antibody\u2013protamine fusion to deliver siRNA into cells expressing the integrin lymphocyte function associated antigen\u20101 (LFA\u20101) protein67 has also shown efficacy. Using a single chain antibody specific against CD7 fused to an oligo\u20109\u2010arginine, Shankar's group has demonstrated T cell specific siRNA delivery and effective inhibition of HIV using antiviral siRNA.62 These and other reports demonstrate the promise of directed siRNA delivery into specific blood cells.68\n",

Naked RNAi mediators when delivered to the bloodstream have half\u2010lives in the order of minutes because of renal clearance.72 In addition, while most serum nucleases do not recognize double stranded RNA, some serum RNAses can degrade siRNA. To overcome these challenges RNAi mediators have been mixed with antibody\u2010containing liposomes or peptides for targeted IV delivery in animal models of cancer. To work effectively, these systemic, yet targeted siRNA delivery systems should have the following characteristics. The RNAi mediator must be protected in the blood stream to prolong half\u2010life, transport must occur across endothelial walls, there must be a specific binding to the cell plasma membrane, active endocytosis in the cell, and the RNAi mediator must be active in the target cell to elicit the desired biological response.

The PEGylated polyethyleneimine (PEI) was complexed with siRNA against VEGF\u2010R2. Tail vein injection into tumor\u2010bearing mice showed selective uptake and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and growth rate. The complex was shown to improve serum stability over 12 h when compared with unformulated RNAi mediator. Using a similar approach, Kim et al.74 utilized PEI\u2010graft\u2010PEG\u2010folate to deliver siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) to folate receptor over\u2010expressing keratin\u2010forming tumor cell line (KB) cells. Results demonstrated successful target reduction in the cytoplasm. Building on the premise of integrin\u2010targeted RNAi mediator delivery, Peer et al.75 developed liposomal based \u03b27 integrin\u2010targeted siRNA vehicles to target specific leukocyte subsets in gut inflammation. Using stabilized unilamellar vesicles (ULV), they covalently attached hyaluronan to palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) in the ULV, which stabilized these particles during systemic circulation and endocytosis. A monoclonal antibody against \u03b27 integrins was covalently attached to the hyaluronan. This systemic application silenced CyD1 in leukocytes and reversed induced colitis in mice by suppressing leukocyte proliferation and T helper cell 1 cytokine expression. Covalent conjugations as performed by Peer et al. are typically performed through reactive sites carried on the head groups of phospholipids with the use of a crosslinker or other intermediary. These conjugations may be performed with homo\u2010bifunctional or hetero\u2010bifunctional crosslinking reagents, carbodiimides, reductive amination, N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, activation of carboxylates, or non\u2010covalent use of an avidin\u2013biotin interaction. Stability and in vivo use of these complexes often depend on the size of each liposomal particle, the amount of antibody in the reaction and the mole amount of lipid in the bilayer formulation. The use of liposomal\u2010antibody conjugates was demonstrated by Pirollo et al.58,59 to specifically deliver siRNAs to both primary and metastatic tumors, including prostate, pancreatic, and breast tumors after systemic administration. Pirollo et al. utilized a TfRscFV\u2010liposomal complex to deliver an anti\u2010HER\u20102 siRNA. The liposome encapsulated the siRNA by a cationic 1,2\u2010dioleoyl\u2010trimethylammonium\u2010propane (DOTAP) dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) lipid and was labeled with the anti\u2010TfRscFV targeting moiety. TfR levels have been shown to correlate with the proliferative nature of tumor cells and recycle during internalization in rapidly dividing cancer cells,76,77 contributing to the uptake of TfR\u2010targeted liposomal complexes.",

Destabilization of targeted liposomes following acidification has been enhanced by: (1) inclusion of (DOPE) which undergoes a lamellar to hexagonal phase transition at low pH, releasing captured liposomal components and (2) pH sensitive peptides that attach to the liposome at neutral pH and bind adjacent bilayers at acidic pH. Utilizing the latter approach, Chen et al.78 and Aoki et al.79 have developed histidine\u2013lysine polymers that were shown to disrupt the endosomes and increase transfection efficiency over unmodified cationic liposomes.

Understanding how RNA\u2010based therapies can be delivered into tissues affected by disease will be essential if they are to be widely successful in treating disease. Most current clinical trials utilize direct injection into organs or targeted administration of unmodified siRNA or siRNA with minor chemical modifications. While direct injection or targeted administrations remain the best option for siRNA delivery today, it is unlikely that siRNA\u2010based therapeutics will be limited to these approaches.
