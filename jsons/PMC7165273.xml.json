By administering local anesthesia around the neck region, surgical tracheotomy was performed by two otolaryngologists. Before opening the trachea, we confirmed that muscle relaxant action and oxygenation were sufficient for the subsequent surgical procedures. The ventilator was turned off immediately before tracheal incision to avoid aerosol generation of blood or tracheal secretions. A scalpel was used to incise the trachea to reduce the risk of airway fire, and the trachea was opened between the second and third trachea rings. After the trachea was opened, any electrosurgical device was not used to avoid the aerosolization of viral particles. While observing the intubation tube directly inside the trachea, otolaryngologists asked the anesthesiologist to pull out the intubation tube up to the level of the arytenoid cartilage. Immediately, the tracheostomy tube was placed into the trachea and was temporally sutured with the trachea to avoid accidental extraction. After the anesthesiologist carefully examined the connection between the ventilator and tracheostomy tube, mechanical ventilation was restarted. We confirmed the chest movement with regularity. After removing the intubation tube from the mouth, we fixed the tracheal tube to the neck skin. Postoperative radiography showed that the cannula was placed at the appropriate position of the neck by all team members. The procedure, from gowning to de-gowning, took 75 min. Most importantly, the PPE was taken off by a non-contact person to avoid self-contamination and exposure to surrounding people.",

A previous report of 138 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China demonstrated that 43% of the patients were infected in the hospital [1]. Moreover, invasive surgical procedures, such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and bronchoscopy, have been reported to be strongly associated with an increased risk of infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5,6]. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported about tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19. We described the management procedures for tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19, including the surgical and anesthetic process, required medical supplies, and appropriate consultation with an infection prevention team. Our detailed experience of the tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19 is shown in Table 1\n. Although there is a lack of clear evidence for the management of SARS-CoV-2, anesthesia and surgical techniques are thought to be essential to prevent virus exposure and contamination to the self and other medical staff based on the results of previous studies on SARS or MERS [7,8]. Accordingly, careful attention should be paid to invasive medical procedures, and strict PPE is critical for infection prevention among healthcare workers while conducting surgical procedures in patients with COVID-19.",

Practice of droplet and contact precautions would be appropriate to decrease the infection risk during medical care of patients with COVID-19. Current WHO guidelines recommend that the prevention methods for contact and droplet infection should be added to standard precaution, and stricter prevention is needed if aerosol exposure is suspected [9]. Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) also recommend these prevention methods as the prevention of airborne infection is necessary at any given time [10]. We performed the tracheostomy with a gown, N95 mask, double gloves, eye shield, and boots to avoid exposing the medical staff. Further, PAPRs were used for medical staff members who were at a high-risk for the viral infection. During tracheostomy, surgical procedures should be considered to prevent aerosolization of viral particles in a negative pressure isolation room in ICU. Surgeons should check the surgical field to avoid post-operative bleeding from wound bed before incising the trachea using a scalpel. Once the trachea is opened, an electrosurgical device should not be used to avoid aerosolization of viral particles. Notably, sufficient use of muscle relaxants is key to prevent patient movement and coughing, resulting in a considerable benefit for the containment policy for COVID-2019 [11]. Although strict precaution requires additional cost, labor, and time to perform surgical procedures, we should understand the importance of infection prevention and perform the necessary medical procedures to avoid aerosol generation.",

            "text": "The optimal timing of tracheotomy in critically ill patients remains controversial [12]. Previous reports of the SARS pandemic showed that the timing from tracheal intubation to the tracheostomy ranged from14 days-25 days [7,8]. Considering an unstable general condition, early tracheostomy (within 10 days) should be avoided in these novel coronavirus patients with an acute respiratory failure [13]. To decide whether a tracheostomy should be performed, repeated careful considerations by the infection prevention team in the hospital are required. It is recommended that tracheostomy should be performed in patients with COVID-19 only when deemed absolutely necessary, and otolaryngologists encounter and have to deal with this difficult situation directly. Thus, we should know the surgical risks and appropriate management of tracheostomy for both the patients and healthcare team involved. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, 43 operative procedures, including 15 surgical tracheostomies, were performed on SARS-related patients in Singapore. Interestingly, there was no transmission of SARS within the operating room complex, in which staff personal protection, patient risk categorization, and reorganization of operating room workflow processes were thoroughly implemented [14]. Similarly, reliable use of PPE (particularly an N95 mask) significantly reduced the risk of infection among critical care nurses during the SARS epidemic [15]. Therefore, we do not overemphasize the risk of medical procedures in patients who really need intensive treatment for recovery from illness. Depending on the medical resources in each hospital, region, and country, a tracheostomy should be performed with appropriate contact precautions (i.e., double gloves, gown, and eyewear) and airborne precautions (i.e., PAPRs or masks with filter efficiency of greater than or equal to 95%) for the personal protection of staff during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",
