            "text": "Lung transplantation is a surgical procedure during which one or both diseased lungs are replaced by organs from a deceased organ donor (or, less commonly, by lobes from living donors) (Table 18.1). Although survival time after lung transplantation is typically limited, transplantation can confer substantial benefits, including prolongation of life, to selected candidates with advanced lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [1]. Between 1988 and 2011, there were 23,652 lung transplant procedures performed in the USA, of which 5,565 (24 %) were performed for IPF [2]. In recent years, the proportion of lung transplant procedures performed for IPF in the USA has increased, and in 2007, IPF surpassed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the leading indication for lung transplantation in the USA (Fig. 18.1) [3]. In 2011, 36 % of US lung transplant procedures were performed for IPF [2]. In this chapter, we will review the role of lung transplantation for patients with IPF, including candidate selection criteria, the evaluation process, organ allocation in the USA, and outcomes and complications of transplantation.\n\n",

While some patients with IPF do not meet criteria for lung transplantation or may be too well for the procedure, the surprisingly small number of patients with IPF undergoing transplantation annually largely reflects the scarcity of suitable lungs from deceased organ donors. While there were in excess of 12,000 deceased donor kidney transplants performed in the USA in 2011, only 3,160 lungs from deceased organ donors were used for transplantation. This discrepancy is largely due to unsuitable pulmonary conditions at the time of death in the majority of donors, such as pneumonia, ARDS, and pulmonary contusion [2].",

In general, these guidelines recommend that patients be referred for transplant evaluation when it is estimated that a patient has only a 50 % chance of surviving the next 2\u20133 years or has New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms [6]. Given the poor prognosis of patients with IPF, the guidelines specifically recommend that patients with IPF be referred for lung transplantation upon identification of \u201chistologic or radiographic evidence of UIP irrespective of vital capacity\u201d [6]. In a joint statement, the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society, the Japanese Respiratory Society, and the Latin American Thoracic Association have recommended that IPF patients undergo transplant evaluation \u201cat the first sign of objective deterioration,\u201d but details or specific criteria for \u201cdeterioration\u201d were not provided in this guideline document [7].",

The magnitude of harm from obesity in IPF may be substantial, with an estimated twofold increased risk of primary graft dysfunction and a 30 % increased risk of death, and it appears that obesity might account for as many as 20 % of all deaths in the first year after transplantation for IPF [15, 16]. Based on these risks, mild elevations in BMI should not prohibit lung transplantation in all candidates, but instead the risks associated with obesity should be balanced with other risk factors and the potential benefit of transplantation for each individual candidate. In some cases, it may be reasonable to withhold lung transplantation from obese candidates (particularly with severe forms of obesity) until weight loss has been achieved. Healthcare providers should provide counseling, and, when indicated, interventions in order to achieve a healthy weight for all patients with IPF should be recommended, regardless of disease severity. For a discussion of the impact of age and obesity in lung transplantation, we refer the reader to a recent review on this topic [18].",

There are few published descriptions of the required elements of the evaluation of a lung transplant candidate, making the evaluation largely center specific. Candidate evaluation typically begins with a review of medical records to determine if any absolute contraindications exist. If none are identified, the candidate meets with a transplant pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, and/or a transplant coordinator during which an extensive history and physical examination is performed, and the patient and his or her family are educated about the evaluation process, the transplant procedure, postoperative expectations, complications, post-transplant lifestyle changes, and survival statistics. In addition, this opportunity is taken to individualize the discussion of risks and benefits of transplantation and to discuss the patient\u2019s specific barriers to transplantation (such as obesity, underweight, poor functional status, and comorbidities), and recommendations to improve candidacy are made.",

Commonly, patients will not be deemed candidates until they complete miss components of the evaluation, achieve strict health-related goals (such as weight loss and participation in pulmonary rehabilitation), or until additional follow-up shows signs of disease progression. The timing of listing for lung transplantation is based largely on the estimated risk of respiratory failure and death for patients with IPF. Table 18.4 shows known predictors of an increased risk of death in IPF that are recommended by the ISHLT as thresholds for listing patients with IPF for lung transplantation [6]. In addition to these criteria, patients with IPF who have an interval increase in oxygen requirements or develop pulmonary hypertension should also be considered for active listing for lung transplantation. Additional factors that might favor earlier listing for lung transplantation (depending on local donor availability) include pre-sensitization to human leukocyte antigens, need for bilateral transplantation, and short stature.\n\n",

Aside from a 90-day credit for patients with IPF, disease severity was not a factor in determining waiting list priority. In 1999, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the \u201cFinal Rule,\u201d which requires that deceased organ allocation systems de-emphasize waiting time and instead allocate organs based on \u201cobjective and measureable medical criteria\u2026 ordered from most to least medically urgent\u2026\u201d [19]. In response, UNOS/OPTN and the SRTR developed the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) system, which was put into place on May 4, 2005 [20]. The LAS system prioritizes waiting list candidates based on two criteria: medical urgency (the predicted risk of dying within 1 year) and estimated transplant benefit (the number of additional days of life expected from lung transplantation during the next year). Transplant benefit is calculated as the difference between expected survival time after lung transplantation and expected waiting list survival time (medical urgency). Medical urgency and expected survival after lung transplantation are estimated from multivariable regression models that contain the predictors given in Table 18.5. The LAS, which varies from 0 to 100, is then derived from output of these models. Those with the greater medical urgency and expected transplant benefit receive higher LAS scores. After accounting for other criteria (geographic proximity to the donor, pediatric age, and blood type), deceased donor lungs are offered first to those with higher LAS scores. The LAS has been updated since its inception to include the addition of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, and the addition of serum bilirubin is planned (to aid the estimation of medical urgency for those with right heart failure due to pulmonary arterial hypertension). In addition, extensive modifications to the LAS calculation are currently undergoing public comment and will likely be instituted in the near future.\n",

First, the transplantation rate for actively listed patients has increased dramatically with the greatest increase observed among those with IPF (Fig. 18.3), leading to IPF becoming the leading indication for lung transplantation in the USA (see Fig. 18.1) [3]. Second, waiting list mortality rates, which were decreasing prior to institution of the LAS system, have begun to increase, particularly for patients with IPF (Fig. 18.4) [3]. Whether this increase in waiting list mortality is due to removal of healthier patients from the waiting list, due to listing of more severely affected patients, and/or an inadequate number of donors remains to be determined. Third, as discussed above, older patients are now being considered more commonly for transplantation, opening up this treatment modality to a wider pool of patients with IPF.\n\n\n",

The earliest report comparing single to bilateral lung transplantation came from Washington University and found that among 45 patients with IPF who underwent lung transplantation between 1988 and 1998, single lung transplantation was associated with longer survival time than bilateral lung transplantation [28]. An analysis of OPTN data comprising 821 patients with IPF who underwent lung transplantation between 1994 and 2000 also found that single lung transplantation was associated with improved survival compared to double lung transplantation only among patients younger than 50 (which may reflect a population enriched for ILDs other than IPF) [29]. In contrast, a report from Cleveland of 82 patients with IPF transplanted between 1990 and 2005 suggested that bilateral lung transplantation was associated with improved survival compared to single lung transplantation [30]. ISHLT registry data suggest that patients who have undergone single or bilateral lung transplantation for IPF have fared similarly over the first 2 years after lung transplantation, but that single lung transplant recipients have had higher risks of death after that time period [14].\n\n",

For candidates thought to be eligible for either procedure, single lung transplantation should be preferred, since the other lung could be used to transplant a second candidate, and available data suggest that overall outcomes are similar between procedures. Indeed, patients with IPF listed for single lung transplantation have higher transplantation rates and lower waiting list mortality rates than those listed for bilateral lung transplantation [32].",

For patients with IPF, the historical median survival time is 4.5 years (see Fig. 18.2), and unfortunately patients with IPF have the lowest 5- and 10-year survival rates compared to patients with other diagnoses [14]. Risk factors for 1-year mortality after lung transplantation for patients with IPF include older age, mechanical ventilation or hospitalization at the time of listing, prior pregnancy, elevated bilirubin, and elevated creatinine [14]. Despite these risks, observational studies suggest that, on average, lung transplantation prolongs life for patients with IPF [1, 33].",

BOS is often due to obliterative bronchiolitis and manifests as airflow obstruction, but alternative causes have been described [35] and a restrictive allograft syndrome without airflow obstruction is increasingly recognized [36]. BOS is likely a final common pathway of multiple causes of airway injury, including alloimmune-mediated inflammation, infection, and gastroesophageal reflux [37], suggesting a variety of methods to potentially prevent BOS. Nevertheless, once BOS is present, there are (by definition) no known methods to improve lung function. BOS is often progressive and is the leading cause of death after the first year of transplantation [14].\n",
