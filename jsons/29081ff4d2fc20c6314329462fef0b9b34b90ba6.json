First, we observed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV attachment. 25 Second, low pH in intracyplasmic vesicles was required for virus entry. By using the 26 specific clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor or knock down of clathrin 27 heavy chain (CHC), we demonstrated that IBV mainly utilized the CME for its 28 entry. Furthermore, GTPase dynamin1 was involved in virus containing vesicle 29 scission and internalization. Surprisingly, CME adaptor Eps15 had no effect on IBV (44); however, the endocytic pathway that IBV hijacks is unclear. 135 The early step in the entry process of IBV into target cells is initiated by 136 engagement of the S glycoprotein with the receptor. Here, using several cell lines 137 permissive to IBV Beaudette strain, we report that IBV virion attaches to lipid rafts in 138 the cell surface and the efficient entry of IBV into cells requires the presence of intact 139 lipid rafts. We also address IBV entry pathway by systematically perturbing the Anti-VSV G (Ab50549) was obtained from Abcam (UK in Table 3 . Densitometry.

This evidence 800 determines the importance of CME in IBV entry, which is widely hijacked by various 801 envelope viruses. Moreover, the importance of dynamin1, a GTPase that helps to snap 802 the vesicle from plasma membrane, was determined during IBV entry. Lipid rafts is 803 often considered to be involved in CavME. To explain these contradictory with late endosome-lysosome membrane, releases genome in to cytoplasm (Fig. 12) . Images were acquired by LSM880 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss).",

After internalization, virus particles moved along with the classical 32 endosome/lysosome track, as evidenced by co-localization of R18 labeled IBV with 33 vehicle markers Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1 along with the infection time course. Functional 34 inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. VCP, a protein 35 helps early endosome maturation, was involved virus trafficking. Finally, by using the 36 dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion with late 37 endosome/lysosome membranes was induced between 2-3 h.p.i..

Our results reveal that IBV is internalized 147 into cells by CME, transports along early endosomes, late endosomes, and fuses with 148 membrane at late endosome-lysosomes.149MATERIALS AND METHODS150 Cells and viruses. Vero cells, Huh7 cells, BHK-21, and DF-1 cells were maintained 151 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 4500 mg/l glucose, 152 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, USA), 100 units/ml 153 penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA). H1299 cells were 154 maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of penicillin 155 and streptomycin. Above cells were purchased from ATCC (USA) and cultured at 156 37\u2103 with 5% CO 2 . 157 The Beaudette strain of IBV (ATCC VR-22) adapted to Vero cells was used in 158 this study. As a well characterized virus, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) was used 159 as control virus. Virus stock was prepared by infecting monolayers of Vero cells with 160 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in FBS free DMEM. After attachment for 1 161 hour (h), the unbounded virus was removed and replaced with FBS free DMEM. The 162 virus and cells were incubated at 37\u2103 until 100% cells were with cytopathic effect 163 (CPE). After freezing and thawing the virus containing liquid for three times, cell 164 debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000\u00d7rpm, and supernatant was aliquoted 165 and stored at \u221280\u2103 as virus stock. A control of Vero cell lysates from mock-infected 166 cells was prepared in the same manner. The virus yield was assessed by titration on 167 Vero cells in 96-well plates according to the method described by Reed and 168 Muench(45). 169 R18 and R18/DiOC labeling of IBV or VSV.

To this purpose, cells were transfected with siRNA targeting CHC and then 537 infected with IBV (H1299 cells) or VSV (Vero cells). As shown in Fig. 7H-J, 538 depletion of CHC was accompanied by a significant reduction of IBV gRNA 539 internalization and IBV/VSV protein expression, which further demonstrates a 540 functional clathrin pathway is required for efficient IBV infection. 541 IBV entry leads to active actin rearrangement. 542 In Saccharomyces cerevisae, clathrin-coated patches on the cell surface mature 543 into \u223c200 nm tubular invaginations with coat proteins at their tip. The actin 544 cytoskeleton machinery is recruited after coat formation and provides an essential 545 force for membrane deformation and internalization (69). Recent studies have 546 revealed that the rhabdoviruses (70), VSV (7), RABV (71), and IHNV (72) are 547 internalized through CME and depend on actin. Although we have demonstrated that 548 IBV enter cells by hijacking clathrin dependent route, it is unclear whether actin 549 filaments are involved in IBV uptake. To examine the role of actin filaments in IBV 550 entry, we first examined the actin polymerization during IBV internalization. Vero 551 cells were incubated with IBV at 4\u2103 for 1 h, and the temperature was shifted to 37\u2103.552 Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (green) and IBV N 553 antibody at 15 min time interval and were observed by confocal microscopy. In 554 mock-infected cells, the actin stress fibers were visible clearly. At 15 to 45 min.p.i., 555 the number of actin stress fibers dramatically decreased, the cells rounded up, and 21 cells surface displayed significant blebbing. The cell morphology and actin 557 distribution returned to normal at 60 min.p.i. (Fig. 8A). Above observation indicates 558 that IBV infection results in transient actin de-polymerization and re-arrangement. 559 IBV N protein antibody is not sensitive enough to detect the incoming virus. To check 560 whether of IBV internalization associates with actin, R18-IBV was applied to Vero 561 cell. Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin at 15 min time 562 interval, and the red signal of R18-IBV and green signal of actin were observed. As 563 expected, images in Fig. 8B showed that there was no R18 red signal in mock 564 infection group. In the R18-IBV infection group, R18-IBV was detected at cell 565 surface at 0 min, displayed as red signal. After attachment, R18-IBV entered cells and 566 co-localized well with actin at 15, 30, and 45 min, shown as yellow signal. At 60 min, 567 Most R18-IBV particles separated with actin, displayed as red signal again. This 568 observation suggests that IBV enters cells via actin cytoskeleton. Here, we also 569 incubated the well characterized R18-VSV with Vero cells as control group. As 570 R18-VSV enters into cells quickly, we chose the time interval of 5 min. Image in 571 Supplementary Fig. 2A showed that R18-VSV also caused actin fiber 572 de-polymerization and cell rounded up at 5-30 min.p.i.. The cell morphology and 573 actin distribution returned to normal at 30 min. Meanwhile, R18-VSV co-localized 574 well with actin at 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, suggesting that VSV also moves along actin 575 fiber after internalization, consistent with previous report (73).576 We further investigated the role of the actin cytoskeleton in IBV entry by using 577 chemical inhibitors to interfere with actin polymerization or de-polymerization. Vero 578 cells were treated with jasplakinolide (Jas), an actin polymer-stabilizing drug (74-76), 579 or with cytochalasm D (CytoD), which binds to the growing ends of actin filaments 580 and prevents the polymerization (77). Vero cells were pretreated with either Jas or 581 CytoD in increasing concentrations before being infected with IBV. Cells were 582 harvested at indicated time points to measure IBV gRNA internalization or N 583 protein expression. Fig. 8C-D showed that when actin polymers were stabilized by Jas, 584 the IBV internalization and N protein expression were increased in a dose-dependent 585 manner. Fig. 8E-F showed that when CytoD prevented the formation of actin 586 polymers, IBV internalization and N protein expression were also significantly 587 increased. This observation is self-contradictory and out of expectation. Thus, we use 588 the well characterized VSV as control to perform this experiment, ensuring the 589 inhibitors work. When the Jas or CytoD was applied to Vero cells before VSV 590 infection, both inhibitors reduced VSV G protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 2B, 591 C), consistent with previous report of actin dependent entry of VSV (73). These 592 results imply that the inhibitors indeed interfere with actin polymerization or 593 de-polymerization. The enhancement of IBV infection by these inhibitors is not the 594 only case, it has been reported that SFV infection was also enhanced by CytoD 595 pretreatment (78). In all, above results demonstrate that the binding of IBV to cell 596 surface causes actin de-polymerization and rearrangement, however, when the actin 597 de-polymerization and rearrangement are interfered by inhibitors, the virus entry is 598 enhanced. How do the inhibitors increase IBV entry? The underlying mechanisms are 599 unclear. 600 IBV moves across the entire endo-lysosomal system. 601 After identification of the endocytic pathway hijacked by IBV, we next tracked 602 the transport vesicles utilized by incoming IBV.

Taken together, these 726 results demonstrate that VCP is involved in transferring IBV from early endosomes to 727 destination for efficient replication.728 DISCUSSION 729 Viruses must enter the host cell to start their life cycle. Thus, characterization of 730 viral entry pathway is important for understanding of virus pathogenesis and design of 731 anti-viral drugs. Envelope viruses penetrate cells by two different ways: fusion with 732 cell plasma membrane or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Direct membrane fusion on 733 the cell surface is independent of low pH, and access through the endocytosis pathway 734 usually relies on the low pH of the endocytic vesicles. Different endocytosis pathways 735 have been characterized over the past decade, in which the CME is one of the most 736 commonly used by many envelope viruses (93). Coronavirus entry is mediated by S 737 protein, which is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. Previously, it 738 has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV is internalized by CME in human hepatoma 739 HepG2 cell line (39), however, in HEK293E-ACE2-GFP cells, the entry of 740 SARS-CoV is clathrin-and caveolae-independent (40); MHV entry is mediated by 741 CME through the endo-/lysosomal pathway in proteolysis-dependent manner (43, 742 94-97); PHEV enters into cells via CME in Rab5, cholesterol, and low pH 743 dependent manner (98); HCoV-NL63 requires CME for successful entry into the 744 LLC-MK2 cells (99); for the HCoV-229E, a CavME uptake has been suggested (16), 745 however, the clinical isolates of HCoV-229E bypass the endosome for cell entry (100",

            "text": "Lipid rafts are involved in regulation of different biological events, serve as 757 organizing centers of signaling molecules assembly, and influence membrane fluidity758    and membrane protein trafficking (101). The involvement of lipid rafts in virus entry,759    assembly and budding has been demonstrated by either the co-localization study of760 the viral structural proteins and lipid rafts or the effects of lipid rafts disrupting agents 761 on the replication processes of several viruses (102). The best characterized lipid 762 rafts-related non-enveloped viral entry is simian virus 40 (SV40) and echovirus type 1 763 (EV1) (103, 104). Binding of SV40 with MHC class I receptors triggers receptor 764 clustering and redistribution, more caveolae is recruited from the cytoplasm at the site 765 of entry, resulting in caveolae-mediated endocytosis in about 20 min (104). In some 766 cell types, SV40 can enter the caveosomes directly from lipid rafts in non-coated 767 vesicles (105). Similar to SV40, EV1 attachment and binding with cells triggers 768 clustering and relocation of \u03b12\u03b21-integrin receptors from lipid rafts to the 769 caveolae-like structures (104). Depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts inhibits EV1 770 infection (103). For envelope virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus 771 (SIN) require cholesterol and sphingolipids in target membrane lipid rafts for 772 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and entry (29). Many envelope 773 virus receptors are located in lipid rafts or would be relocated into lipid rafts after 774 infection, such as Human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-1) receptor glucose 775 transporter 1 (GLUT-1), Ebola virus and Marburg virus folate receptor-\u03b1 (FR\u03b1), 776 Hepatitis B virus complement receptor type 2 (CR2), Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) 777 receptor CD46 (106). An alternative receptor for Human Immunodeficiency virus 778 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein on epithelial cells is glycosphingolipid 779 galactosyl-ceramide (GalCer), which also enriches at lipid rafts (107, 108). Membrane 780 cholesterol is also involved in the first stages of flavivirus infection (47, 109). Guo et 781 al demonstrate that IBV structural proteins, but not non-structural proteins, migrate 782 and integrate into lipid rafts after viral protein translation. The cholesterol enriched 783 microdomains were only involved in IBV attachment, not virus replication or virus 784 particle release (38). However, the involvement mechanisms of lipid rafts on IBV 785 infectivity are still unclear. In our study, we substantiated the involvement of lipid 786 rafts on virus life cycle via disruption of lipid rafts by using chemicals at pre-, during-, 787 or post-infection, and checked IBV internalization, viral protein expression, and 788 progeny virus release. Results showed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV entry step. 789 Cholesterol replenishment experiment further confirmed that lipid rafts were 790 necessary for IBV entry. Membrane flotation assay showed the co-fractionation of 791 IBV particles and lipid rafts during absorption step. Immunofluoresence showed that 792 R18-IBV associates with lipid rafts on the cells surface.

            "text": "Our final research question was the virus trafficking route. By using R18-labeled 811 IBV to infect cells, we found that IBV attachment leads to actin rearrangement and812 co-localized with actin filament after internalization. This indicates that virus 813 internalization requires the actin de-polymerization or polymerization, to facilitate the 814 virus containing vesicles to move along actin filament. However, stabilization of the 815 actin filament using Jas and inhibition of actin polymerization using CytoD resulted in 816 increase of virus entry. Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases are the key regulators of transport to 817 early and late endosomes, and ablation of Rab5 and Rab7 has been widely used to 818 study viral entry. Using R18-labeled virus, we found that after internalization, 819 incoming IBV particles were first co-localized with Rab5 and then with Rab7, finally 820 overlapped with lysosome marker LAMP1, across the entire endocytic network. The 821 importance of Rab proteins were examined by overexpression and RNA interference 822 technology. The results showed that Rab5 and Rab7 played crucial roles for IBV entry, 823 confirming that IBV trafficking really depends on early and late endosomes. Also, 824 using the R18 and DiOC double labeled virus, we revealed that the membrane fusion 825 happens at 2-3 h.p.i., the time point of virus reaches late endosome-lysosome. 826 Overexpression of VCP, a protein involved in endosome maturation, increased virus 827 gene expression. We speculated that IBV particles were first transported to early 828 endosomes in Rab5-demepdent manner, and were guided to late endosomes in Rab7 829 and VCP dependent manner. Also, the Rab7 dependence indicates that membrane 830 fusion depends on endosomal maturation, suggesting that low pH environment in the 831 late endosome-lysosome may provide an important signal for fusion and viral gRNA 832 release.833In conclusion, we conduct a systematic study to dissect IBV entry process in 834 susceptible cell lines. The evidence presented here indicates that IBV attaches to lipid 835 rafts, induces actin de-polymerization, internalizes into clathrin coated vesicles via 836 dynamin1 snapping, transports along early/late endosome, and lysosome, finally fuses 837",

Whether the CavME is involved in IBV endocytosis may be cell type dependent and is controversial. To explore the involvement of CavME in IBV entry, we utilized Huh7 cell, which lacks functional caveolae (15, 60), to perform above experiment. As evidenced by high level of intracellular viral gRNA and N protein expression, efficient virus internalization and replication was observed inHuh7 cells (Fig. 5G-H), demonstrating that IBV entry is independent of caveolae. Moreover, CPZ pretreatment significantly reduced IBV gRNA internalization and N protein expression in Huh7 cells, while neither Amiloride nor Nystatin reduced the 481 internalization and replication (Fig. 5G-H), consistent with those observed in other 482cell lines. Combining above results, we conclude that IBV entry is mediated by CME, and this is not restricted to cell types.CME of IBV is dependent on dynamin1 but not Eps15.Eps15 is a regulatory protein which has been characterized by a ubiquitous and constitutive association with the AP-2 protein adapter. Microinjection of Eps15 antibody interfered with transferring and EGFR internalization (61), suggesting that Eps15 plays an important role in CME. Several reviews described previously that the expression of the C-terminal dominant negative form of Eps15-DN, which contains the AP2-binding site, could efficiently block the uptake of Sindbis virus (62).Dynamin1 is a GTPase facilitating membrane fission to generate endocytic vesicles in CME and CavME (47, 63, 64). Many reviews describe that dynamin1 is required for the internalization of various viruses, as the dynamin1-K44A, a dominant negative mutant demonstrated preciously to block virus entry (65, 66). To examine the involvement of Eps15 and dynamin1 in IBV entry, we expressed pEGFPN1, GFP-tagged Eps15-WT, Eps15-DN, dynamin1-WT, and dynamin1-DN in H1299 cells, respectively, followed by IBV infection. pEGFPN1 was expressed as the control.
