            "text": "In March 2013, a new type of avian influenza virus, H7N9, was isolated for the first time in China1. In the spring of that year, an outbreak of H7N9 influenza occurred in 10 provinces in central and eastern China2. Until June 30, 2017, the H7N9 virus has caused 5 nationwide outbreaks: January 2013 to September 2013 (134 cases, 45 deaths), October 2013 to September 2014 (306 cases, 131 deaths), October 2014 to September 2015 (219 cases, 102 deaths), October 2015 to September 2016 (114 cases, 47 deaths), and October 2016 to June 2017 (1058 cases, 221 deaths)3,4. The average case fatality risk of H7N9 infection is approximately 40%3, which is higher than the case fatality risk of SARS (11%)5 and lower than that of H5N1 (70%)2. The fifth epidemic was the most severe; cases were diagnosed in 20 provinces and the total number of cases exceeded the sum of the previous 4 epidemics3. These 5 epidemics occurred mostly in China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas3. The genetic characteristics of the viral strains were similar in all 5 epidemics6,7. The main sites of infection were live poultry markets8,9. The main route of transmission was human contact with infected poultry or virus-contaminated environments; no connections were demonstrated between patients7, and only limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission within individual regions was observed10,11.",

The state-certified network laboratory reports each case, via the pneumonia of unknown etiology (PUE) surveillance system, to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)12. A study conducted by Cowling et al.2 showed that the mean incubation period of H7N9 is 3.1 days and follows a Weibull distribution, and that the median interval from onset to laboratory confirmation is 8.3 days and follows a log-normal distribution. These study results provide an important basis for our further investigations.",

However, the exact time that a patient becomes infected is difficult to ascertain, mainly because patients themselves do not know exactly when they became infected; most can give only a rough estimate, and some are unclear even about this. Because the exact time that infection occurs cannot be obtained through epidemiological surveys, the use of mathematical models to arrive at a reasonable estimate is a good choice.",

For example, Zhang et al.13 established a dynamic model including migratory birds, resident birds, domestic poultry, and human populations; they concluded that migrant birds were most likely the original source of infection. Lin et al.14 modelled chicken-to-chicken transmission and found that environmental transmission via viral shedding by infected chickens contributed to the spread of the virus. These studies help us to understand the prevalence of the virus among poultry and the mechanisms of its transmission from poultry to humans. According to the transmission route of H7N9 avian influenza, each infected individual is relatively independent, the dynamic model of infectious disease spread cannot be used. Quantitative analysis of epidemic spread within human communities is crucial for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which epidemics spread. However, no studies have yet been published on the evolutionary mechanism of the entire process from infection to symptom onset to diagnosis.",

Therefore, this study has important implications for a deeper understanding of the onset and progression of H7N9 avian influenza epidemics and for a more precise description of its temporal distribution patterns. Its results can be used for the timely assessment of the effects of a series of government-instituted interventions and for exploring causal relationships between the time series of new infections and new confirmed cases, and provide a statistical basis for in-depth analysis of the impact of human and natural factors on the epidemic.",

Hence, the autocorrelation should be extracted from their respective series\u2014pre-whitening is a precise tool for achieving this aim22. As the 2 series showed significant seasonal fluctuations, seasonal differencing was performed. After differencing, the series remained non-stationary; hence, first order differencing was performed to obtain 2 stationary time-series with a mean value of 0. Then, the same filter, based on the first series (an autoregressive model), was applied to pre-whiten the 2 time-series, followed by calculating the CCFs of the pre-whitened series22.

Lin et al.13 and Zhang et al.14 established mathematical models to explore viral transmission mechanisms within different populations. Cowling et al.2, Wang et al.3, and Bui et al.18 provided detailed descriptions on the temporal, spatial, and population distributions of the epidemics. These studies laid the foundation for investigating the epidemiological characteristics of the H7N9 epidemics. Compared with these published studies, the innovative points lie in our analysis of the transmission mechanisms in the human population from a stochastic perspective, according to the transmission characteristics of H7N9. The occurrence of infection was treated as a random event produced by a Poisson process, and the rate of infection changed with time. Therefore, the entire epidemic process can be regarded as the connection of multiple Poisson processes occurring at different rates. We established a relationship between the probability of infection and a continuous time Markov chain; the growth rate of new infections was then obtained.",

The growth rate of new infections reflects the frequency at which susceptible individuals come into contact with the virus: The more frequent the contact, the faster the rate of new infections increases. Therefore, we believe that this rate is the earliest and most accurate reflection of the severity of the epidemic. Although changes in the number of confirmed cases can reflect the temporal distribution features of the epidemic, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is delayed by a period of time greater than that of infection; in our study, the average delay was 13 days (standard deviation, 6.8 days). Therefore, evaluating the epidemic\u2019s development trend using the temporal distribution of confirmed cases is imprecise. This study aimed to analyze the epidemic trend more accurately and to establish a more precise statistical foundation for analyzing the impact of various prevention and control measures adopted by China, and meteorological and environmental factors, on the epidemic. For example, some influencing factors\u2014such as closing and regular disinfection of live poultry markets, atmospheric temperature, rainfall, and the number of migratory birds\u2014can be evaluated more timely and accurately by judging the growth rate of new infections.",

Based on this, we can conclude that the occurrence of infections will lead to the occurrence of confirmed cases. Furthermore, the results verified that the establishment of random models is consistent with objective facts. With a lag of 0, a significant negative CCF is obtained (Fig. 2); this does not imply a true negative correlation between the 2 time series.
