The Department of Health, Executive Yuan of Taiwan ROC has made efforts in promoting the \u201cProject of Reforming Taiwan\u2019s Medical Care and Public Healthcare System\u201d since the spread of SARS was controlled. The reform of the medical care system aimed to provide better holistic medical treatment to people. The strategies and methods are strengthening the improvement of resident education and quality of medical care. A project titled \u201cPostgraduate General Medical Training Program\u201d was announced by the Department of Health in August 2003. Through this project, each doctor in his/her first year of residency (including internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, etc.) is required to fulfill 3 months of an internal medical training course, along with 36 hours of basic courses. In the past, there was no such program in Taiwan to provide general medical training for medical students after graduation. Therefore, the goal of this program is to ensure that all PGY1 residents have acquired Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competence in internal medical care.",

The checklists for all 6 OSCE stations have similar items to cover ACGME core competency. The items that PGY1 presented completely were scored as \u201c1\u201d and those not presented were scored as \u201c0\u201d. All faculty raters attended serial training sessions that included extensive instructions on how to use the checklist in practice rating sessions.

Additionally, the resulting scree plot of the eigen values revealed that the leveling off to a straight horizontal line occurred after the sixth eigen value. Then, we performed a principal axis factor analysis with oblique rotation to a preselected six-factor solution. The factors that emerged from this analysis clearly reflect each of the six core competencies of residency (Table 2). Intriguingly, items from each competency loaded on their intended factor and did not load with items from different scales of competencies. In other words, the factor analysis resulted in a nearly perfectly clean structure, providing evidence that our theoretically derived items in checklist of PGY1 OSCE were distinct and evident in the reflection of core competence of their clinical performance.",

The square of the factor proportion gives the percentage of the variability that an element contributes to a system.

One strategy for increasing the reliability over the present level of about 0.65 is to increase the number of stations. Using the Spearman-Brown formula, it is estimated that two additional stations would be necessary using the bench model with global scoring to achieve a reliability of 0.8. In the present study, each OSCE station measured two aspects of ACGME core competency and assessed two to four specific skills. Thus, another solution to increase reliability of ACGME competency-based OSCE might be to increase the number of OSCE stations and evaluate only one specific skill for each aspect of ACGME competency in the future.",
