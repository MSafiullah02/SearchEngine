            "text": "The ideal scenario for efficacious vaccination requires initiation of a potent immune response by a vaccine formulated to resemble the situation of the natural infection [1], [2]. In reality, vaccines are manufactured to resemble as close as possible the pathogen in question, but lacking a pathogenic nature; elaboration of this approach has sought to dissect the vaccine into the most pertinent immunogenic component(s) for promotion of protective immune defences. With virus vaccines based on the whole virus, approaches have included the application of attenuated variants as well as inactivated antigen. Moreover, a study of the evolution in vaccine design to combat viral infections shows how manipulations of the vaccine composition have increased the success rate for generating efficacious vaccines. An appreciation of these approaches, and their evolution, shows three main elements essential for successful vaccination. (i) The antigenic characteristics of the vaccine itself. (ii) The mode of vaccine delivery; until the last decade often ignored or relegated to the position of an \u201calso-ran\u201d. This has a particular significance in that efficient vaccine delivery relates directly to vaccine proficiency at targeting the host immune system. (iii) Adjuvant application, a major tool and often critically important component for an efficacious vaccine. This is a major provider of the \u201cdanger\u201d signals necessary for activating the innate responses essential for promoting efficacious specific immune defences. Although viruses and bacterial components can themselves provide danger signals, these may require efficient replication of the pathogen, which is not possible with inactivated or subunit vaccines. Alternatively, only a week danger signal may be provided due to a low-level interaction with the appropriate receptors, or the presence of inhibitory signals.",

Accordingly, an important issue for vaccine design is consideration of the ligands carried by a number of pathogens, which interact with receptors on cells of the immune system. Adjuvants also contain components interacting with immune cells, particularly of the innate immune defences. In both respects, the involvement of dendritic cells (DC) is crucial, due to their role as central players in the immune defence development (Supplementary Fig. 1). DC ensure both appropriate recognition of danger signals and correct processing of the vaccine antigen, promoting efficacious development of innate and acquired immune defences [3].",

Most inactivated, protein-based vaccines induce acquired (specific) immune responses involving MHC Class II-restricted T-helper (Th) and B lymphocytes: Antibody-dependent immune defences. An additional defence important for removing infected or \u201caltered self\u201d host cells is that involving MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, although these are less evident following vaccination with inactivated vaccines. Overall, the central and key player for inducing efficacious acquired immunity is the DC [4]. These areas are covered in detail elsewhere [3]. Following endocytosis of the vaccine, DC process the antigen towards presentation of derived peptides to T lymphocytes (in association with either MHC Class II or Class I molecules). Advances in murine and rat immunology have shown that DC may \u201cdeliver\u201d antigen in a more intact form to B lymphocytes, releasing the antigen to stimulate the B lymphocytes [5]. Furthermore, DC release cytokines of major importance for B lymphocyte activity: type I interferon (IFN), IL-6, IL-12 and BAFF [6].",

            "text": "Efficacious vaccination is dependent on the efficiency with which the vaccine interacts with the DC subsets. This raises the question of vaccine delivery, which will influence how both conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) \u2013 as well as monocytes and macrophages \u2013 become involved. DC possess a broad spectrum of cell surface receptors involved in the initiation, promotion and execution of immune responses [7]; importantly, the expression patterns for these receptors vary between cDC and pDC. Among these are the TLR, scavenger receptors, and C-type lectin receptors (Fig. 1\n). All are important pattern recognition receptors (PRR), recognizing PAMP on pathogens \u2013 and indeed antigens, adjuvants and vaccines \u2013 essential for the development of innate immune responses and defences [8], [9]. With PAMP binding to PRR on the DC surface, they also offer potential as targets for vaccine delivery. Ligation of particular PRR evokes rapid activation of the cell, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on leukocytes, as seen with DC and macrophages [9]. With other PRR, such as certain C-type lectin receptors, their ligation leads to enhanced endocytosis. For DC acting as antigen-presenting cells (APC), the ligation can also lead to induction of DC maturation\u2014an essential step licensing these cells to induce potent effector as well as memory immune responses [10], [11]. A good example of PAMP ligating PRR to activate cDC is seen with bacterial lipopeptides and lipoproteins recognized by heterodimeric TLR2-TLR1 or TLR2-TLR6. Lipopeptides deliver a strong activation signal to DC, which is the basis of their potent activity as immunoadjuvants in vitro and in vivo, at least in rodents and primates [12], [13], [14]. C-type lectin PRR such as the multilectin DEC-205 receptor and the mannose receptor are more involved in enhanced endocytosis. Ligation of these receptors has also shown potential for vaccine targeting and activation of DC [15]. In the murine system, ligation of DEC-205 enhances receptor-dependent endocytic processes leading to efficient recycling of the antigen through late endosomes\u2014such processing is likely to enhance antigen presentation to CD4+ helper T lymphocytes. In contrast, ligation of the mannose receptor tends more to promote recycling through the peripheral endosomal compartment.",

[25] also demonstrated difficulties for vaccinia virus to replicate in human DC \u2013 immature as well as mature \u2013 leading to an abortive infection in which proteins under control of the late promoters were lacking. Nevertheless, a certain level of protein translation does occur in DC, which could promote antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation.",

With respect to vaccine vectors, there is a reported absence of vaccinia virus-induced maturation in the DC [24]. Moreover, a reduced expression of certain costimulatory molecules \u2013 CD80 and CD83, but not CD86 or MHC \u2013 on the virus-infected DC, together with a reduced capacity for stimulating T-cell proliferation was observed [25]. The modified vaccinia virus Ankara was even more problematic for human DC in terms of reduced cellular protein synthesis leading to increased apoptosis in the virus-infected DC [27]. While these latter events would be advantageous to the development of cytotoxic immunity, through cross-presentation of the apoptotic cells, the results overall query the value of direct interaction of vaccinia virus vectors with DC. Yates and Alexander-Miller [28] showed that when vaccinia virus infected immature DC, there was no induction of maturation, yielding DC incapable of initiating T-cell activation. It was only when mature DC were infected with vaccinia virus that functional antigen-presenting cells were generated, capable of activating vaccinia virus-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Moreover, Nagorsen et al. [26] noted that the efficiency of the vaccine virus vector-delivered vaccine was dependent on the HLA haplotype and the epitopes carried by the vaccine.",

Unfortunately, it has been reported that PRV infection of macrophages is associated with immunological malfunction [32], [33]. In contrast, PRV was seen to be a potent activator of porcine pDC [34], which would be beneficial for its use as vector. Such results show that the interaction of PRV with cDC and pDC needs further characterization before one can propose this as a vaccine delivery vehicle targeting DC. Indeed, the above results on both poxviruses and PRV demonstrate the need to understand the type and status of the DC being targeted by a vaccine carrier, to ensure the appropriate processing leading to activation of effector immune defences.",

Such discriminatory results from adenovirus interaction with DC subsets may relate to the receptors required by different adenovirus serotypes, or differences between rodents and humans (see the comment in the next paragraph concerning CD46 expression). Interestingly, the targeting of adenovirus to human DC was enhanced when the virus was engineered to express CD40L on its capsid [51]. Bontkes et al.

In this context, adenoviruses have a clear application. Receptors have been identified on human DC, as well as human or murine monocytes and macrophages, with which particular adenoviruses can interact. However, an initial problem was realised when the major cell receptor for virus binding was characterized as the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) [52]. Despite being a widely expressed cell adhesion molecule, this receptor has not been found on DC or monocytic cell populations [53], [54]. In contrast, another receptor \u2013 CD46 \u2013 is expressed on DC [55], [56]. However, CD46 is employed by subgroup B adenoviruses such as adenovirus 35. Subgroup C adenoviruses such as the widely applied vaccine vector adenovirus 5, as well as canine adenovirus type 2 vaccine vector, employ CAR [54], [55], [56]. Nevertheless, the work with CD46 has shown its importance as a receptor for vaccine targeting, being present on many subtypes of human DC. Interestingly, it is not expressed on murine DC [57].",

Alternatively, the vector may have used receptors other than CAR and CD46 on DC.

Adenovirus can bind to cells via its fibre protein, after which the viral penton base interacts with cellular integrins such as \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 to promote virus entry. This role of the penton base appears to be dependent on the RGD motifs in the five identical subunits, at least with cells lines [60], [61]. Involvement of the \u03b1v integrins may be more important for virus internalisation than for attachment to the cell [60]. Yet, modifying the viral fibre knob of adenovirus type 5 to carry an RGD motif results in enhanced infectivity for murine DC [62]. While the interaction of the virus fibre protein is clearly important for binding to cell lines, penton base interaction with \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin is important for binding to human monocytes and macrophages [58]. Akin to attachment via the fibre knob, interaction with \u03b1M\u03b22 integrin still required the additional step involving \u03b1v integrins for virus internalisation.",

[59] demonstrated that adenovirus type 5 modified to carry a heparan sulphate-binding heptalysine motif were more efficient at transducing human monocytes and macrophages. A candidate heparin-binding KKTK motif was also identified in the third pseudorepeat of the fibre shaft from adenoviruses 2 and 5 [63]. Moreover, many viruses can bind to heparan sulphate structures on cells, particularly following cell culture passage of the virus as is often the case when producing vaccine viruses. However, heparan sulphate structures are rather ubiquitously expressed, and may not be ideal for enhancing DC targeting over interaction with other cell types. On the contrary, CR3 is more restricted to cells of the innate immune system, namely DC, macrophages and monocytes. Indeed, in contrast to adenoviruses type 2 and 5 (subgroup C adenoviruses), adenovirus type 3 (subgroup B) did not require heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans for binding to and infection of cell lines [63].",

A chimeric adenovirus was created by modifying the subgroup C adenovirus type 5 to carry the subgroup B adenovirus 35 fibre antigen [55]. This increased interaction with human DC up to 100-fold. A similar approach may be achieved by applying short peptide motifs known for their capacity to interact with integrins expressed on DC, as described above in Section 3.3.3\n[62]. One disadvantage with this approach is that certain motifs, such as RGD, have the potential to bind with different integrins. Nevertheless, the presence of the RGD motif in chimeric adenovirus penton bases apparently did not influence their interaction with integrins [54], suggesting an involvement of other structures; perhaps fibre antigens carrying the KKTK motif of the adenovirus 35 would be important [55]. Indeed, Perreau et al.

Indeed, human adenovirus 5 and canine adenovirus 2 appear to be endocytosed into distinct intracellular compartments [54]. The roles of different receptors leading to distinct compartmentalisation within the cell, as well as the influence of multiple receptor involvement, are important considerations when analysing the potential for targeting vaccines to DC. While there is information concerning the binding of particular vaccines to DC, there is less information on the endocytic route taken thereafter. This is unfortunate, because the endocytic process will determine if an antigen is released (for interaction with B lymphocytes), processed through MHC Class II (for Th lymphocytes), or processed via the immunoproteasome for presentation in association with MHC Class I (for Tc lymphocytes). The endocytic pathway employed will also determine if genetic information carried by a viral vector vaccine is translated into protein. These are important issues, which will be raised again later during discussion of C-type lectin receptor targeting.",

The authors suggested that the asymmetric binding of TfR might be due to the virus possessing only one unique site with the conformation for binding to the TfR. Alternatively, the binding of the virus to the TfR might induce the asymmetry. Whatever the mechanism, this binding differs from that associated with picornavirus infection, in which up to 60 sites on the icosahedron can be involved [65].",

In addition, TGEV has been employed as a vaccine vector; reviewed by Enjuanes et al. [75]. TGEV efficiently induces IFN production by pDC [41], [76], [77], [78], an ability which is independent of virus replication. Viral pseudoparticles expressing M and E proteins, and resembling intact virions, retained the interferogenic activity of the virus [79]; neither the virus genome nor the spike (S) protein necessary for infection of cells were essential for IFN induction. The induction of IFN did require virus interaction with the cell surface, but not all virion structures were important. Relating to the above report from Baudoux et al. [79], Riffault et al. [80] had shown that antibody against the TGEV receptor aminopeptidase N did not prevent the IFN induction; nor was antibody against surface M protein effective. Moreover, reconstructing detergent solubilised virus into virosomes did not reconstitute IFN induction capacity. The authors concluded that the induction of IFN required a complex native envelope protein structure. As such, it has been difficult to identify the receptors involved in this IFN induction, although it does seem certain that the induction is being signalled from interaction with receptors on the pDC surface. Insofar as being applicable for targeting vaccine to DC, one may employ the pseudoparticles expressing M and E proteins [79].",

The efficiency of the virosomal vaccine carrier (for example: [81], [82], [83]) would suggest that \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acids on DC (at least murine and human DC) were the target for such vaccines. Indeed, Angel et al. [84] demonstrated that virosomes interacting with pDC are reliant on sialic acid structures on the cell surface; endocytosis of the virosomes by pDC was inhibited by neuraminidase treatment. However, one also has to consider the targeting of the C-type lectin mannose receptors on DC; Reading et al. [85] demonstrated the importance of the mannose receptor for influenza virus infection of murine macrophages. Nevertheless, sialic acid residues on DC would offer the potential for vaccine targeting, particularly when the vaccine construct carries the haemagglutinin glycoprotein.",

These lack a viral genome, physically carrying the vaccine antigen of interest within their virion structure. With the foreign (\u201cvaccine\u201d) antigen being within a chimeric structure, replication is no longer necessary. In fact, chimeric vectors can be regarded as \u201cdelivering\u201d the vaccine in a manner similar to that for an inactivated vaccine. Chimeric viruses based on non-enveloped VLPs can also be defined in terms of structures or sequences interacting with DC receptors. Indeed, it can be seen that the non-enveloped viruses mentioned in Section 3.4 would be candidates for chimeric VLP-based vaccines.",

Good examples of this approach are the reported applications of porcine parvovirus and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2; Table 4), which have been employed for both homologous vaccines [92] and for delivering heterologous epitopes [93], [94], [95].",

These polymers offer a main advantage over the vaccine vectors described above in Section 3, as well as those based on other viruses, bacteria or their products. Biodegradable polymers do not induce a strong or durable immune response against themselves. Moreover, they are efficiently degraded into non-toxic metabolites, primarily via the Krebs cycle. Particulate carriers are also flexible in their design, composition and structure, which has led to the demonstration of their high potential as vaccine carriers [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106].

It will be interesting to see how this application of nanoparticle-delivered adjuvant functions in the porcine host, particularly considering the differences between murine and porcine immune system. As far as delivery of vaccine antigen is concerned, early results using ovalbumin as a model are showing considerable promise both in vitro with porcine DC (Supplementary Fig. 2) and in vivo (Harwood et al., unpublished results).",

A major consideration \u2013 for both anionic and cationic particles \u2013 is that sufficient charge be available for binding the cargo. The particle charge is also important concerning mode and efficiency of delivery in vivo. For example, Macklin et al. [114] successfully employed gold particles for epidermal delivery of a DNA vaccine to immunise pigs against H1N1 influenza virus, using a device for particle-mediated gene transfer to the epidermis [115]. Negatively charged nanoparticle constructs also show high potential for delivery through pig skin [116]. Efficient permeation of pig skin was obtained with the negatively charged particles ranging in size from 50 to 500 nm, leading the authors to propose such nanoparticles as potential delivery vectors for transdermal vaccination.",

This is a major point of criticism raised by Lauterbach et al. [128]. They sought to elaborate on this question by using DNA constructs for either ubiquitous expression (CMV promoter) or specific expression in DC (CD11c promoter). Following biolistic vaccination of mice with DNA-coated gold particles, both forms of construct efficiently induced antibody responses. However, the DNA encoding for DC-specific expression was insufficient at inducing optimum T lymphocyte responses. Porgador et al.

However, many of these articles use the observation that an immune response was generated against the antigens encoded by the DNA as evidence for targeting of the DC (for example, see the review by Jilek et al. [130]). This is rather speculative, and cannot be considered as proof. On the other hand, the biodegradable particles themselves do interact efficiently with DC (reviewed by Jilek et al. [130]). Insofar as DNA vaccine delivery is concerned, the most convincing work comes from in vitro studies using cell lines. Jilek et al. [131] successfully transfected a murine DC line with PLGA microparticles carrying DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). However, the number of cells expressing GFP was low, which the authors related to the requirement for DNA to escape the phagosome wherein the PLGA particles would be degraded. This is a critical point considering the cytosolic localisation of phagosomes contrasting with the cellular localisation of DNA transcription machinery.

Protein is ideally delivered into an acidifying endosomal system, to promote its processing for presentation in association with MHC Class II to Th lymphocytes. For processing in association with MHC Class I, leading to activation of Tc lymphocytes, a different intracellular localisation is required. In the case of RNA, a cytosolic delivery is required, to ensure that the delivered RNA is not degraded by cellular RNases. PLGA particles are reported to escape from endosomes, delivering their payloads into the cytoplasm [138], [139]. Nevertheless, the processes of cellular uptake, retention and processing are not well characterized for particulate vaccine delivery vehicles interacting with DC. This is certainly the case for particles decorated to target and/or activate PRR on the DC. How this would influence delivery to intracellular compartments is of pertinence when choosing the targeting ligand. A good example is the comparison of material delivered through ligation of the DEC205 receptor compared with ligation of the mannose receptor. Targeting DEC205 can lead to antigen recycling through late endosomes, whereas ligation of the mannose receptor may promote more of a recycling process through the peripheral endosomal compartment [15].",

For the latter, one has to consider removing the Fc portion of the antibody, or preventing its interaction with FcR on cells of the innate immune defences.

Siglec-15 preferentially recognizes Neu5Ac\u03b12-6GalNAc\u03b1 [147]. Galectins bind glycoconjugates containing \u03b2-galactose structures [148], [152]. However, it is uncertain how vaccine particles interacting with different Siglecs would signal the DC, and how this would influence the outcome of vaccine handling by the cells. Interaction of a vaccine with a Siglec carrying an ITIM would not necessarily be detrimental for vaccine targeting, because it is not yet certain how DC would respond to vaccines using Siglec ligands for targeting purposes. For example, Siglec-10, which carries an ITIM, is reported to bind human red blood cells and soluble sialoglycoconjugates [145]. The Siglec-H, which lacks tyrosine-based signaling motifs, is endocytosed leading to the processing and presentation of captured antigens [153]. Yet, this Siglec signals intracellularly via the DAP12 adaptor with which it is associated, leading to reduced pDC responses against TLR ligands. Siglec-15 also signals via DAP12 and DAP10, but it has been suggested that this signaling implies delivery of activating signals to the cell [147]. Another receptor, Siglec-1 (CD169), is reported to be the receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) binding to and internalisation by porcine macrophages [154]. Considering that virus interaction with this receptor would lead to internalisation, targeting Siglec-1 may prove a useful vaccine targeting strategy. Siglec-1 is also expressed by DC, being upregulated on mature cells, along with Siglec-2 and Siglec-7 as well as two of the galectins\u2014galectin-3 and galectin-8 [148].",

With respect to the studies on Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide interaction with DC-SIGN [155], mannan and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) were found to interfere with bacterial binding. Mannan, including oxidized and reduced derivatives, enhanced antigen targeting to and endocytosis by DC. This resulted in an activation of the DC and immune response induction in vivo, at least in the mouse [157]. Moreover, the differential application of the oxidized and reduced forms of mannan can favour a more Th1 or Th2 type response, respectively [158].",

Certainly, TLR ligands such as chemically defined lipopeptides have potential as adjuvants [159]. Although lipopeptides have not been reported in terms of vaccine delivery for pigs, lipopeptides and lipoproteins have been tested for their adjuvant potential. These have been employed either as an integral antigenic component of the vaccine [160], [161], [162], or admixed with the vaccine antigen in a more classical manner [163]. The disadvantage of lipoproteins is that they themselves can be antigenic. In contrast, lipopeptides such as the synthetic compounds based on tri-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam3Cys) and di-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam2Cys) tend to serve primarily as PAMPs for TLR2 dimers, thus allowing for their application in a more generic sense [164].",

Although there is some evidence that vaccine targeting to DC has high potential for porcine vaccines, most of the information comes from inference to work with murine and human DC. Therein, a major effort is being made in the development of both viral and synthetic vaccine carriers. A critically important consideration therein is how receptor ligation influences the characteristics of vaccine interaction with the DC. Whether protein or RNA delivery is being employed, the antigen ultimately present in the DC \u2013 delivered by the carrier or translated from the delivered RNA \u2013 has to be processed via endosomal recycling and processing. Accordingly, current research on vaccine targeting to DC is seeking to determine the influence of the vaccine delivery vehicle surface decoration on modulation of DC activity. This is linking to the cytosolic localisation of the delivered vaccine cargo, which will be different for a protein cargo compared with an RNA cargo. The key element is to define the manner of targeting to the DC which will promote the appropriate delivery, leading to efficacious immune defence development (Supplementary Fig. 4).",
