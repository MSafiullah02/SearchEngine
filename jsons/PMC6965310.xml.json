Previous studies have suggested risk factors for an abnormal elevation in pressure in CPB, such as older age2, male sex1,3, coronary artery disease1\u20133,10, and polycythemia vera11. Hypothermia and alkalemia might also be associated with an abnormal elevation in pressure, although these factors are not sufficient by themselves3,9. Fibrin deposition inside CPB equipment might be involved in the underlying mechanism1,2,6,9,10,12. However, whether intensification of anticoagulation can ameliorate an abnormal elevation in pressure is unclear because most patients have already received a large amount of unfractionated heparin1,2,11,12. Therefore, the precise mechanism of an abnormal elevation in pressure during CPB is unknown.",

In this ex vivo circuit, we used a removable filter with a pore size of 40 \u00b5m because the pore sizes of a cardiotomy filter and arterial line filter in CPB equipment are approximately 40 \u00b5m, while the span of oxygenator fibers is approximately 50\u2013250 \u00b5m. Using the ex vivo circuit system and porcine blood, we found that abnormal elevation of in-circuit pressure was associated with leukocyte activation or senescence in this study. Furthermore, we found that extracellular DNA deposition on the outlet of the filter was responsible for the abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure.",

In control conditions where porcine blood was freshly collected (day 0) and unstimulated, in-circuit pressure was not increased. Neither a change in temperature ranging from 37 \u00b0C to 10 \u00b0C nor a change in pH ranging from 8.0 to 6.8 in the circuit system increased in-circuit pressure (data not shown). In contrast, long-term storage of blood significantly increased in-circuit pressure (p < 0.05) if blood was anticoagulated with heparin (Fig. 1B), while in-circuit pressure elevation was minimal if blood was anticoagulated with citrate (Fig. 1C).

In contrast, heparin administration significantly increased in-circuit pressure (pre- vs post-heparin administration, p < 0.01) if blood was stored for 5 days or longer. When day 7 stored blood passed through the filter, a grossly visible sticky substance was adhered (Video S1). Immunofluorescent analysis showed that this sticky substance was composed of extracellular DNA and fibrin(ogen) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, little extracellular DNA was observed when day 0 blood was passed through the filter, and some intact nuclei and fibrin(ogen) were observed (Fig. 2B). A three-dimensional reconstitution technique showed that the extracellular DNA layer was located immediately downstream of the filter (Video S2 and Fig. S2). The fibrin(ogen) layer was located downstream of the DNA layer (Fig. S2). These results suggest that DNA is primarily responsible for obstruction of the circuit.",

In immunofluorescent analysis, extracellular DNA was detected all over the filter through which whole blood passed, whereas extracellular DNA deposition was not observed on the filter through which PRP passed (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that platelets and plasma, two important components in thrombus formation, are not sufficient for abnormal elevation in pressure, and leukocytes and/or erythrocytes play an essential role.",

In-circuit pressure was elevated at the oxygenator if heparin was administered in whole blood that was stored for 7 days (Fig. S1B). Furthermore, DNase treatment immediately decreased in-circuit pressure. These findings indicate that extracellular DNA is directly responsible for obstruction of the circuit.",

However, immunofluorescent analysis showed deposition of extracellular DNA on the filter surface (Fig. S5B). These findings suggest that transfusion of old blood is not sufficient for elevation of in-circuit pressure by itself but may become the genesis of pore-clogging. Then, we examined whether leukocyte stimulation results in elevation of in-circuit pressure since previous studies have suggested that stimulated leukocytes are prone to releasing DNA into the extracellular space13. In-circuit pressure was increased if whole blood on day 0 was stimulated with phorbol 12-miristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Fig. 5A). Heparin administration in PMA-stimulated blood led to a significant further increase in in-circuit pressure (Fig. 5A,B). Immunofluorescent analysis showed that PMA stimulation induced deposition of extracellular DNA all over the filter surface (Fig. 5C).

Furthermore, heparin injection caused leukocytes to release extracellular DNA. Previous studies have reported an abnormal elevation in pressure in CPB1\u20139. However, no studies have suggested that extracellular DNA can contribute to abnormal elevation in pressure. Extracellular release of DNA from neutrophils, called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), was first described in infectious diseases14, and the process was named NETosis. This process is morphologically and functionally distinct from other forms of cell death13,15. Recently, subsequent studies established that other immune cells also release extracellular DNA (renamed ETosis) in eosinophils16,17, basophils18,19, monocytes20, macrophages21, and lymphocytes22. Although ETosis was induced by different stimuli for several minutes to hours in these studies, a unique study showed that high hemodynamic forces trigger rapid NET release within 2 minutes23. Our data are in good agreement with this previous study. We found that leukocytes, including neutrophils, were disrupted when they passed through the narrow site in the circuit, and extracellular DNA was adhered downstream of the filter.",

Heparin is the most common anticoagulant in cardiac surgery because its effects can be measured by monitoring the activated clotting time and reversed by protamine. With regard to the dose of heparin used in this study, 5 U/mL corresponds approximately to 400 U/kg and is thus reasonable in CPB settings24. However, some reports have suggested that heparin itself affects functions of leukocytes, besides its role in anticoagulation. Lazarowski et al.25 reported that heparin alone, ranging from 0.3 to 15 U/mL, could induce in vitro aggregation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Cairo et al.26 reported that PMNs stimulated with N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine were aggregated by heparin, although heparin itself did not promote aggregation at low doses. This finding indicates that even low heparin concentrations can promote aggregation of PMNs if they are activated. They considered that this aggregation might be induced by heparin\u2019s highly negative charge and ability to locate the surface of the cell membrane. Gebska et al.27 showed that apoptotic and necrotic leukocytes had a high affinity for heparin compared with healthy live leukocytes. In our study, aggregation of leukocytes and platelets was observed at day 3 in heparinized blood, but not in citrated blood, in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears (Fig. S6). Some of the aggregates were more than 40 \u00b5m. This aggregation of leukocytes led to difficulty for them passing through the filter, leading to physical stress and they were easily destroyed. Accordingly, heparinized blood and blood after adding heparin are likely to raise in-circuit pressure. Similarly, leukocytes stimulated with PMA were aggregated with nuclear degeneration and cytoplasmic vacuolization (Fig. S6).",

First, we showed that leukocyte-derived extracellular DNA contributed to an abnormal elevation in pressure in an ex vivo circuit, but it may be merely a partial explanation of abnormal elevation in pressure in clinical settings. Other factors, such as thrombosis, may also be associated with abnormal elevation in pressure in some cases. These factors may induce this phenomenon simultaneously. Further clinical investigations are required. Second, we did not assess the contribution of platelets to the abnormal elevation in pressure in our ex vivo circuit. We measured the number of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets in our experiments. When in-circuit pressure was elevated, the numbers of platelets and leukocytes were decreased (Fig. 3C). Some clinical studies have also reported a decline in platelet count during CPB with or without an abnormal elevation in pressure8,31. Platelets are presumed to initially attach to the filter, which leads to narrowing of the space for blood to pass through. In a microfluidic study that showed shear-induced NETosis, platelets were accumulated and fluid shear stress was increased, which resulted in disruption of leukocytes23. Further investigations are required to understand the role of platelets in abnormal elevation in pressure in CPB.",
