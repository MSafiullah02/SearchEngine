We invite submissions that speak to the role of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives in the study of health professions education, in particular those that reflect our focus on theory and method from diverse social and behavioural science disciplines. Papers could take a variety of formats: a review of the history of contributions from disciplines such as psychology and sociology, introduction of new disciplinary/or interdisciplinary thinking, or original studies exemplifying the use of theory and/or methods from a discipline. We would also be interested in contributions to HPE from fields such as economics, business, engineering, big data, and artificial intelligence among others. Further details on the Journal website.",
