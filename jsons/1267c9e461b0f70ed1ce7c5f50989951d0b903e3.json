However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole. * Duccio.Fanelli@unifi.it \u2020 Francesco.Piazza@cnrs-orleans.fr arXiv:2003.06031v1 [q-bio.PE] ",

Among the countries hit by the epidemics, Italy found itself grappling with the worst outbreak after the original one, generating considerable turmoil among the population. The exponential increase in people who tested positive to COVID-19 (supposedly together with the sudden increase in the testing rate itself), finally prompted the Italian government to issue on March 8 th 2020 a dramatic decree ordering the lockdown of the entire country.",

The idea is to investigate the relation between some population at time (day) n + k and the same population at day n, corresponding to a time lag of k days. Of course, the simplest case of all is to build day-by-day maps (k = 1). We built three such maps, associated with the population of cumulative confirmed infected people (C), recovered people (R) and total reported deaths (D) for the three countries considered. We note that I = C \u2212 (R + D) is the total number of infected individuals, i.e. without taking into accounts recoveries and deaths.

(3), this simply means that one should regard \u03b2 = 0.928 as an average figure. In fact, each population will be characterized by slightly different value of \u03b2, which will yield considerably different plateaus, since they are all close to the singularity at \u03b2 = 1 (see again Eq. (3)). The prediction (3) should not be regarded as the true asymptotic value to be expected at the end of the outbreak for either populations. Rather, it should be regarded as an estimate of the total population initially within the ensemble of people who will eventually get infected. In fact, the elements of the ensemble (C, R, D) are not independent, as people get infected, recover and die as time goes by, thus effectively transferring elements from one population to another. We will show in the next section how this can be accounted for within a simple kinetic scheme, where eventually such interactions will cause the population of infected individuals I to die out and the R and D populations to reach two separate plateaus as observed. Furthermore, it should be noticed that the data plotted in Fig. 1 start from the first pair of successive values (P n+1 , P n ) encountered in the data sheets with P n+1 , P n > 0, consistent with the fact that P = 0 is also a (trivial) fixed point of the map (1). The mean-field 1 kinetics of the SIRD epidemic evolution is described by the following system of 1 In a mean-field approach such as this one, spatial effects are neglected, while the populations are considered as averaged over the whole geographical scene of the epidemics outbreak.

This is likely to be connected with many culture-related habits and to the presumed diversity in underlying health conditions of the more vulnerable that are expected to influence these parameters. It should also be noted that this discrepancy might eventually get reduced when more data on the outbreak in Italy will become available. This would also imply an increase of the initial number of susceptible people, S 0 .

Concurrently, the model fails to follow the observed rapid recovery and overestimates the number of deaths. This is most likely due to the harsh containment measures adopted by the Chinese government in order to curb the spread of the disease. A simple way to test this hypothesis is to restrict the fit to the initial growth phase before the onset of the peak. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 . Indeed, it can be appreciated that a model that does not include any external curbing action on the infected population reproduces quite nicely the initial growth phase, places the peak at the correct time, but fails to match the swift recovery rate and decline of the infection in the window where the imposed restrictions are assuredly in action.",

The number of deaths at the end of the epidemics appear to be about 9,300, which is consistent with figures typical of seasonal flu epidemics. Taking into account that the confirmed cases can be estimated to be between 10 and 20 % of the real number of infected individuals [2], the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 seems to be between 3 % and 7 % in Italy, higher than seasonal flu, while it appears substantially lower in China, that is, between 1 % and 3 %.",

While a reduction in the epidemic peak and mortality rate are indeed observed, we predict that such effects will only be visible if the measures cause a quick (matter of days) and drastic (down by at least 80 \u2212 90 %) cutback of the infection rate. In Italy and in other countries that will be facing the epidemic surge soon, this is quite possibly only achievable through a cooperative and disciplined effort of the population as a whole.",

We found that the data reported for the outbreak in France are still too preliminary to warrant a meaningful fit of this kind. The set of free parameters and the initial conditions used were [r, a, d, S 0 ], [S 0 , I 0 , 0, 0] in the case of Italy and [r, a, d, S 0 , R 0 , D 0 ], [S 0 , I 0 , D 0 , R 0 ] in the case of China, respectively. In the former case, due to the prolonged initial stretch of stagnancy (presumably due to the initial low testing rate), we chose t 0 = 20 days after day one (22/01/2020) and fixed the populations at the corresponding reported values I 0 = 3, R 0 = D 0 = 0. In the case of China, we set t 0 to day one, as the reported initial populations bear evidence of an outbreak that is already well en route. However, we found that the initial values reported for all the populations, but notably the infected individuals, appear underestimated. This is consistent with the abrupt, visible increase appearing around mid-February, when Chinese authorities changed the testing protocol[1, 2]. Consequently, we let the initial values I 0 , S 0 , D 0 float as well during the fits. Interestingly, we found that identical fits could be obtained by fixing the initial values of the populations at the reported values and allowing for a (negative) lag time \u03c4 , signifying a shift in the past of the true time origin of the epidemics. In this case, we obtained \u03c4 = 30 days, consistent with the presumed outset of the outbreak.The best-fit values of the floating parameters are listed in",

Our results seem to suggest that there is a certain universality in the time evolution of COVID-19. This is demonstrated by time-lag plots of the confirmed infected populations of China, Italy and France, which collapse on one and the same power law on average. This suggests that a country that becomes the theatre of an epidemics surge can be regarded, at least in first approximation, as a well-stirred chemical reactor, where different populations interact according to mass-action-like rules with little connection to geographical variations.The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths (SIRD) model reveals that the recovery rate is the same for Italy and China, while infection and death rate appear to be different. A few observations are in order. Chinese authorities have tackled the outbreak by imposing martial law to a large fraction on the population, thus presumably cutting down the infection rate to a large extent. While data on the outbreak in China bear the signature of this measure, the data on the outbreak in Italy clearly do not at this stage. Moreover, it can",
