Attempts to resolve these complexities have led to the proposal of a variety of trial designs, including individual randomization and several types of cluster randomization designs: parallelarm, ring vaccination, and stepped wedge designs. Because of the strong time trends present in infectious disease incidence, however, methods generally used to analyze stepped wedge trials may not perform well in these settings. Using simulated outbreaks, we evaluate various designs and analysis methods, including recently proposed methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials, to determine the statistical properties of these methods.

They also may exhibit biases due to imbalance between clusters, especially with the high incidence heterogeneity of outbreaks, and they have less flexibility to adapt the design or increase sample size (3, 9, 11, 16) . To better understand the statistical properties of these designs, we can evaluate their performance on simulated outbreaks (17) .

            "text": "from the IRT and CRT designs are analyzed as described by Hitchings et al., using the time to symptom onset for each enrolled individual (15). For the IRT, statistical analysis is conducted using a stratified Cox proportional hazards analysis, stratified by community. For the CRT, statistical analysis is conducted using a Cox proportional hazards model with a gamma-distributed shared frailty to account for clustering by community. The results from the two SWT designs are analyzed using a variety of methods, all based on the number of individuals with symptom onset in each cluster in each period. This method has the advantage of being less sensitive to consistent determination of the date of symptom onset, but may have less power than methods using the time to event. The methods used are: \u2022 MEM: Mixed effects model with a fixed effect of time and a normallydistributed random effect for cluster, with a logit link (26); \u2022 CPI: Mixed effects model with a fixed effect of time and independent normally distributed random effects for cluster and cluster-period,",

In both panels, for all three methods, there is a clear trend of maximum effect estimate early in the trial (although not at the very beginning for SWT-B) and a declining effect as the trial continues. For SWT-B, the negative effect estimates early in the trial are likely due to the very small number of clusters on intervention at that point, which can lead to a few simulations with a high number of early cases in those clusters having a big effect on the averages presented here. Later in the trial, clusters that have been on control throughout are more likely to have exhausted the susceptible population than clusters already intervened-upon, leading to lower incidence in the control clusters than the intervention clusters at that point. In other words, the flattening of the epidemic curve due to the intervention leads to an apparent decreased effectiveness of the intervention in later periods as the intervention clusters still have more remaining susceptible individuals than the control clusters.",
