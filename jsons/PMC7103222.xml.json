            "text": "Cytokines are important mediators of the immune response and have been shown to play a pivotal role in host immune defense to microbial infection [5]. Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) has been recognized as a multipotent cytokine due to its broad range of regulatory functions during virus-induced host immune responses [6], [7]. IFN-\u03b3 can directly influence the differentiation of T cells and promote Th1-type immune responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [5], [8]. Virtually all immune cell types express receptors for IFN-\u03b3 and are influenced by this cytokine. Signaling by IFN-\u03b3 leads to up-regulation of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, which in turn increases the antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells by macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells [9], [10]. IFN-\u03b3 also increases the expression of class I MHC, resulting in enhanced stimulation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells [11], [12]. Upon stimulation of these cells by IFN-\u03b3, CD8+ T cells are important in the eradication of intracellular virus during recovery from viral infections [13], [14], [15]. Moreover, high levels of IFN-\u03b3 bias the polarity of CD4+ T helper cells towards a Th1 phenotype, characterized by production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3\n[16], [17]. A Th1-type immune response is fundamental to the development of host immunity against many pathogens, including influenza A virus [18], [19], [20]. IFN-\u03b3 is also necessary for T cell-mediated viral clearance and limitation of latent viral infections [21]. Moreover, IFN-\u03b3 production is considered to be critical in determining vaccine efficacy [22], [23]. Therefore, measurement of IFN-\u03b3 production in both natural and experimental influenza A virus infections will improve our understanding of the antiviral immune response, which may assist the development of more effective vaccines.",

Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have been used by researchers to identify novel viruses, determine strain toxicity and evaluate vaccines [28]. Ferrets are naturally susceptible to human strains of influenza virus and display many of the same symptoms that appear in humans, including sneezing, nasal discharge, weight loss and an increased body temperature [29]. Indeed, the Spanish flu virus (H1N1) was first identified in ferrets [28]. Ferrets therefore represent a fundamentally important model for studying the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza. A current limitation to the ferret influenza model, however, is the lack of species-specific immunological reagents required to assess host responses in vaccinated and infected animals. In the current study, we report the full-length cloning of the ferret IFN-\u03b3 cDNA, expression of the recombinant cytokine, and the generation of monoclonal antibodies suitable for ELISA and ELISPOT detection of natural ferret IFN-\u03b3.",

We are therefore prompted to generate monoclonal antibodies specific to ferret IFN-\u03b3. To produce ferret IFN-\u03b3 specific antibodies, recombinant IFN-\u03b3 was conjugated to a carrier protein, KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) using glutaraldehyde. The resulting KLH-IFN-\u03b3 complex was injected i.p. into Balb/c mice. Following fusion of splenocytes isolated from IFN-\u03b3-immunized mice with hybridoma parent cells, IFN-\u03b3-reactive B cell hybridomas were established. Hybridoma clones, selected by ELISA reactivity, were tested for specificity by immunoblotting against recombinant ferret IFN-\u03b3 and supernatants from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMCs (Figure 3\n). Clone 3E7 recognized a 36 kDa band in samples of recombinant ferret IFN-\u03b3, demonstrating that the ferret IFN-\u03b3 reactive monoclonal antibody can also detect the dimerized form of IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 3). Additionally, a weak band at \u223c65 kDa was consistently observed indicating a possible detection of another oligomeric form of ferret IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 3). Interestingly, the study of culture supernatants derived from mitogen-stimulated PBMCs showed prominent bands at 60\u201370 kDa and the band at 36 kDa was only weakly detectable (Figure 3).

To this end, we tested our monoclonal antibodies for utility in a ferret IFN-\u03b3-specific ELISA assay. To select the antibody pair for IFN-\u03b3 recognition in ELISA assays, we tested monoclonal antibodies derived from different clones. The clone 3E7 was conjugated to biotin and used as the detection antibody against ferret IFN-\u03b3 and antibodies from five other clones were used to coat the assay wells. Of the five monoclonal anti-ferret IFN-\u03b3 antibodies that we screened in this manner, the clone 1E3 consistently showed the presence of Ferret IFN-\u03b3 in mitogen-stimulated ferret spleen cell supernatants. Therefore, we decided to continue using 1E3 as the ELISA capture antibody paired with 3E7 as the detection antibody. As shown in Figure 4A\n, an ELISA was carried out using the paired capture and biotin-conjugated detection antibodies, and demonstrated an increase in optical density that correlated directly with the concentration of purified recombinant IFN-\u03b3. The increase in optical density exhibited a smooth logarithmic correlation between 10 pg/ml and 10 ng/ml of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 protein (R\n2=0.9826). Using this standard curve, we measured the concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in in vitro-stimulated PBMC supernatants. IFN-\u03b3 was present only in samples that were treated with PMA in conjunction with a Ca2+ ionophore (Figure 4B).

Previous studies on IFN-\u03b3 have shown that there is a strict species-specific activity of IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3 genes isolated from diverse species such as guinea pig, turkey, rhino, and catfish have been previously described in the literature [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Since ferrets are susceptible to human viral diseases, including influenza A virus [35] and SARS-coronavirus [29], we expect that the availability of the ferret IFN-\u03b3 assay system described in this study will greatly expand the utility of the ferret infection model.",

            "text": "Unexpectedly, the monomeric form of IFN-\u03b3 (17 kDa) was detectable at only low levels in recombinant ferret IFN-\u03b3 samples. Instead, a dominant band at \u223c36 kDa was consistently observed during Western blotting whereas a weak band at 65\u201370 kDa was also observed in the same sample. Conversely, when native IFN-\u03b3 in mitogen-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants were investigated with monoclonal antibodies, dominant bands were identified at 65\u201370 kDa and the \u223c36 kDa band was barely detectable. Oligomeric forms of IFN-\u03b3 were very stable aggregates, as treatment with reducing reagents, guanidine or urea did not disrupt the IFN-\u03b3 into its monomeric form (unpublished data). Since the IFN-\u03b3 dimer was also observed in supernatants from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMC cultures, it is unlikely that the dimerization is caused by the epitope tags present on the recombinant protein. The recombinant IFN-\u03b3 dimer was found to have biological function consistent with known IFN-\u03b3 activity [36]. Treatment of ferret PBMC cultures with the dimerized recombinant IFN-\u03b3 increased the surface presentation of class II MHC (unpublished data), suggesting that the recombinant ferret IFN-\u03b3 is able to maintain biological function in the dimerized form. We observed, however, an IFN-\u03b3-specific band in Western blotting of mitogen-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants at a molecular mass at 65 kDa. This suggests that the probable form of ferret IFN-\u03b3 in vivo exists in tetrameric form rather than a dimeric form. Our observation of recombinant ferret IFN-\u03b3 seems to contradict the recent report on guinea pig IFN-\u03b3 in which recombinant IFN-\u03b3 was shown to exist primarily as a monomer [30]. Recombinant guinea pig IFN-\u03b3 was expressed in bacteria, and the purified protein was capable of stimulating the class II MHC expression in guinea pig cells. It has been reported previously that human IFN-\u03b3 shows a dominant band at approximately 65 kDa in immunoblotting and human IFN-\u03b3 specific receptors are shown to be reactive with IFN-\u03b3 dimers [37]. Other groups have demonstrated that carbohydrate modification alters the molecular nature of human IFN-\u03b3\n[38]. Taken together, these observations suggest that it is not unreasonable to find that ferret IFN-\u03b3 may exist in monomeric, dimeric and oligomeric forms. Subtle variation in amino acid sequences between two species may result in differences in post-translational modification by glycosylation, which could result in differential association of monomers into oligomers. Alternatively, the origin of cells secreting IFN-\u03b3, such as CD8+ T cells or NK cells, may determine the differences observed in IFN-\u03b3 oligomerization. The interaction between ferret IFN-\u03b3 and its receptor under physiological conditions may be mediated by IFN-\u03b3 dimerization or oligomerization. Whether or not dimerization is the mechanism of IFN-\u03b3 activation in other species obviously requires further investigation.",
