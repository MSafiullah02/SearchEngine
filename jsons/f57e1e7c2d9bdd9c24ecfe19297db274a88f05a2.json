Statistical analyses, such as traditional mean tests, rank order tests, two-step cluster analysis, and principal component analysis were used to analyze the survey data. The results revealed that Chinese tend to be more tolerant of risk than Japanese and South Koreans. In all three countries, the threats of global warming, cancer, traffic accidents, and fire were perceived as higher-order risks, while infectious diseases and threats from high technology were perceived as lower-order risks. Looking across the entire multi-country sample, we found that Chinese participants perceived greater Japan it was the opposite with women perceiving greater risks. A comparison of these results with previous studies reveals a bias in past studies toward student samples and indicates the need for more representative samples in multi-country surveys.",

As Rohrmann (1999) observed, quite a number of cross-country studies have been carried out by social psychologists, but these mainly focused on Western or industrialized countries. One or two Northeast Asian countries are sometimes included in comparative studies, but they are usually compared with Western countries. A typical sampling of past studies shows that they focused on Japan and the U.S. (Kleinhesselink and Rosa 1991; Hinman et al. 1993; Hirose et al. 1994) , China and the U.S. (Keown 1989; Hsee 1998, 1999; Weber et al 2005) , China and Australia (Rohrmann and Chen 1999; Bian and Keller 1999) , China and Austria (Schmidt and Wei 2006) , and Korea, Japan, and the U.S. (Cha 2000b ).

In their study, Jacobs and Worthley (1999) examined perceived risk data from the U.S., China, Japan, and South Korea. They then compared their data with similar results collected from previous studies in Burkino Faso (a West African Country), France, Norway, and Hungary. The data reveal that certain risks such as nuclear weapons, war, and AIDS have high perceived risks in all countries. The results also show that many of the events have dissimilar perceived risks in different countries and that some countries have higher overall levels of perceived risk (South Korea), while others such as the U.S. display generally lower values. Note, however, that the authors acknowledged that their sample was biased: limited to college students, and predominantly male (100% in Japan, 82% in South Korea, and 78% in China). At the same time, that sample was rather small, with only 50 subjects from Japan and 50 from China. Thus, one of our chief concerns in the study reported in the present paper was to see whether a larger and more representative sample would yield different results from those obtained by Jacobs and Worthley. Some new types of risks have emerged to worry people the world over. New infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and bird flu have not resulted in many deaths but have generated great consternation all across East Asia. Science and technology have made progress in developing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that may improve the global food supply, but GMOs could have as yet unknown adverse effects on ecology and human health. The diffusion of information technology is accelerating the transfer of data and opening up all sorts of new opportunities, but it is also accompanied by the growing threat of leakage or theft of our private information. Therefore, our second objective in writing this paper is to clarify how people perceive such risks and to discover what differences exist between different Northeast Asian countries.",

For centuries past, Northeast Asia has been deeply influenced by Confucian thought and a stronger emphasis on collectivism rather than individualism. Furthermore, although China, Japan, and South Korea are located in Northeast Asia, they have very different geographical, political, social, and economic characteristics (Table 1) .

Here, risk is defined by the probability of an unwanted event occurring and by the magnitude of its consequences, and risk perception refers to the views or attitudes that people have of risks. Risk perception is usually studied, as reviewed in detail by Renn and Rohrmann (2000) , from the psychometric paradigm and sociological and cultural approaches. Rohrmann and Renn suggest that \"the former approach is based on four intentions: (1) to establish risk as a subjective concept, not an objective entity, (2) to include technical/physical and social/psychological aspects in risk criteria, (3) to accept options of \"the public\" (i.e., lay people, not experts) as the matter of interest, and (4) to analyze the cognitive structure of risk judgments, usually using multivariate statistical procedures. They add that \"according to the cultural approach, risk is a social and cultural construction, not an objective entity to be measured independently of the context in which hazards occur\". In the present paper, we try to integrate the above two approaches to discuss risk perception determined by cross-country surveys in Northeast Asia: Japan, China, and South Korea.",

First, several people were asked to formally pre-test the questionnaire and provide feedback on how much time they spent, the difficulties they had with the questions, and so on. The questionnaire was revised based on the information obtained. Second, 1000 households were randomly selected from a commercial phone directory database (Kurofune 2004, published by Datascape & Communications Inc.) as the subjects. Third, the questionnaire was sent to the selected households by mail with a cover letter giving details of the institute and instructions for completing the survey. Also enclosed was a self-addressed stamped envelope for the subjects to return their surveys and a postcard on which the subjects were instructed to give their responses. The respondents were asked to send their questionnaires and postcards separately to ensure that their replies to the surveys were anonymous. Fourth and finally, we followed up with a reminder postcard 2 weeks after the initial mailing to encourage those who had not responded to do so. Out of a total of 835 surveys successfully distributed, we received responses from 450 households, for a response rate of 53.9%.",

            "text": "Chinese tend to be more risk tolerant than Japanese and South Koreans. The results of PCA and TSCA show that South Koreans perceived risks as moderate although their mean risk rating scores were approximately equal to Japanese scores. This might be attributed to a number of complicated reasons. First, Sokolowska and Tyszka (1995) found that poorer countries tend to be less concerned about technological and en- vironmental risks, and China, as the largest developing country in the world, does exhibit lower levels of perceived risk than Japan and South Korea, which are developed countries. Certainly, risks are relative, and it may be reasonable to assume that at this stage in their development, Chinese are more preoccupied with what for them are more fundamental risks like food shortages because they have limited resources. A second source of greater risk tolerance may stem from China's growing self-confidence due to recent rapid economic development. Xie et al. (2003) found a higher risk rating among Chinese after the East Asian financial crisis than before, and they concluded that the timing of the later survey and the inclusion of many laid-off workers in their sample may have contributed to the relatively higher risk rating. This implies that good economic development may lower risk perception. The Chinese economy today is now at the take-off stage and has been growing at close to 10% a year since 1990. The per capita GDP has now broken the US$1000 level, which means that peoples' basic needs to survive and live are now being met. Rapid economic development and a sustainable rise in the standard of living may promote general optimism and self-confidence toward the future, which have the effect of lowering peoples' risk perception. A third factor in China's greater risk tolerance may simply be a lack of sufficient information about potential risks. China is a developing country, and the people are making great sacrifices to improve the quality of their lives by promoting economic growth. In this context, the importance and necessity of political and so-cial stability are strongly emphasized through extensive media coverage, while the risks associated with high technologies such nuclear power and genetic engineering are little discussed in public (Xie et al. 2003) . One final factor may be the longstanding historical and/or cultural tendency of the Chinese. Proverbs suggest that Chinese tend to be less risk averse in financial and social dealings than Americans (Weber and Hsee 1998) . The findings presented here are consistent with those of Jacobs and Worthley (1999) , whose sample may be regarded as a sub-sample of the younger-than-40 cohort in our study. Regarding the younger-than-40 subjects, South Koreans exhibited higher PC1 scores than both their Japanese and Chinese counterparts (Fig. 6) . This suggests that a sample with a wider range age could dilute the age-specific bias of this sample.",

Previous studies focused on the public perception of different risks, so we cannot directly compare our results with theirs. In the case of China, Xie et al. (2003) reported an obsessive concern with risks threatening national stability and economic development and far less concern with high-technology risks and natural disasters by analyzing 28 risks pertaining to social issues, everyday life activities, natural disasters, and science and technology development. Jacobs and Worthley (1999) found that nuclear weapons, war, and AIDs have universally higher perceived risks in all countries by evaluating 30 risks relating to potentially dangerous activities, technologies, or substances. Integrating our findings with the data published on China in previous studies (Xie et al. 2003; Jacobs and Worthley 1999) , we can tentatively prioritize the order of perceived risk from most to least worrisome in China as risks affecting national stability and economic development, ones related to environmental issues and natural disasters, ones related to disease, and risks faced in everyday life activities.",

New risks having marginally mean ratings were GMO in South Korea and SARS, bird flu, and GMO in Japan. This may be explained as the result of much more extensive media overage of these risks compared with natural disasters, in accordance with the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) scheme proposed by Kasperson et al. (1988) . Within this framework, the media are regarded as important transmitters of risk information, potential 'amplification stations' that increase the volume of risk information about an 'event,' and through reinterpretation and elaboration of available symbols and imagery, they serve to increase the salience of certain aspects of a message to its receivers.",

These differences reflect the socioeconomic circumstances of each country. For example, consider earthquakes. During the period from 1980 to 2000, China and Japan experienced many earthquakes (2.1 and 1.14 major quakes a year, respectively), while South Korea registered no major earthquakes at all during this period (UNDP 2004) . The direct exposure to earthquakes in China and Japan has heightened awareness and perception of the risk of this form of natural disaster in these two countries. Risk perception results for typhoons, gas explosions, and some of the new types of risks such as SARS may be similarly analyzed. The greater concern over the risk of Internet viruses in Japan may be attributed to the extensive media coverage of private information protection after the enactment of the Private Information Protection Law in 2003 and its implementation on April 1, 2005. The much higher risk for drug abuse perceived by Chinese can be attributed to the draconian and widely publicized laws against illegal drugs in that country up to and including capital punishment.",

Slovic (1987) used 18 variables and asked participants to evaluate 81 risks in a study designed to explore the factorial structure of the risk concept. Our study focused on just a single aspect of overall risk rating, and we may wish to reassess this approach and perhaps incorporate other aspects of risk in future research. This paper leaves some interesting issues and questions that lie beyond the scope of this research. The first is the sample bias due to different sampling methods. Sample bias has two different aspects: whether the sample is representative of the total population and whether there is good comparability for data obtained from different countries. The former is an age-old question in survey research: how representative is \"representative enough\". The latter always seems to conflict with the availability of data when collecting data in different countries, particularly in developing countries like China. We once planned to carry out surveys with identical samplings in Japan, China, and South Korea, but failed because of some national regulations or an insufficient telephone database. Although the present study did to some degree modify and improve on the results of previous research, it still left some questions. To what extent do these groups reflect the general attitudes of the total population? To what degree do these risk perceptions reflect national, cultural, or current concerns?",

            "text": "PCA is one of the multivariate methods of analysis and has been used widely with large multidimensional data sets. It is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the maximum variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second maximum variance on the second coordinate, and so on (Rao 1964; Cooley and Lohnes 1971; Jolliffe 2002) . PCA is theoretically the optimum transform for given data in least square terms. PCA results are usually discussed in terms of component scores and loadings (Shaw 2003) .For a data matrix X T with zero empirical mean, the PCA transformation is given byHere, V W T is the singular value decomposition of X T . Y is a matrix where each vector is the projection of the corresponding data vector from matrix X onto the basis vectors contained in the columns of matrix W. X is a data matrix consisting of the set of all data vectors, one vector per column. W is the matrix of basis vectors, one vector per column, where each basis vector is one of the eigenvectors of C and where the vectors in W are a sub-set of those in V. V is the matrix consisting of the set of all eigenvectors of C, one eigenvector per column. is a matrix containing the singular values.",
