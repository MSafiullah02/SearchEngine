Our study found that a case definition for meningitis was the most difficult for case detection (29.94%). Other studies have also reported similar problems with case definition and diagnosis of meningitis affecting the positive predictive value of meningitis.[13] It was disconcerting to note that only 28% of our study subjects could accurately diagnose suspected malaria and the unusual syndrome. Malaria being a highly endemic disease in Orissa, we recommended repeated training and reinforcement at regular intervals, to familiarize with the case definitions and syndromic diagnosis for malaria. It has been proven beyond doubt that syndromic surveillance has time and again demonstrated to be an effective mechanism for early detection of the malaria epidemic, from the experience of the African continent. The case in point is Ethiopia, where weekly percentile cutoffs proved to be an efficient tool for the detection of a malarial outbreak, and hence, there was no need to always rely on complicated algorithms.[14]",

A review of these facets of a surveillance system provides an indirect measure of the quality of data. Examining the percentage of unknown or blank responses to items on the surveillance forms or questionnaires is straightforward. Assessing the reliability and validity of responses would require special studies such as chart reviews or re-interviews of respondents.[6] In conducting a public health investigation, the first task is to differentiate natural (statistical) variability from \u2018pseudo-outbreaks\u2019 due to data entry or coding errors from a true increase in an infectious illness.[25] This is one of the reasons why many experts question the capacity of syndromic surveillance to provide an early outbreak detection, as there is a lack of precision in the data it generates.[26] Therefore, a potential data source should be judged by the combination of its data quality and timeliness, as well as, knowledge of the cost of false alarms versus the cost of delays in triggering true alarms for a specific disease threat.[25]",

This can only be achieved if the surveillance program has good data management and analysis systems, to enable identifying of the threshold level, to serve as alarms.[3637] Since the 1990s, syndromic surveillance has proven its utility as a reliable instrument in the early detection of outbreak.[38] The utility of syndromic surveillance is dependent on the alarm thresholds. The WHO has advocated alerts when weekly cases exceed 75% of the baseline?[3] Some methods used are CPEG, commonly used by both the military systems, and currently coded 0 if the observed data are not outside the historical limits (\u2018normal\u2019 situation), + if the observed data are outside the historical limits by more than two standard deviations (\u2018pre-alarm\u2019), and ++ if by more than three standard deviations, compared to the expected data (\u2018alarm\u2019). It is important to be aware that syndromic surveillance is associated with an increased risk of false alarms,[39] hence, we need to be extremely cautious in the interpretation of epidemic alerts, because investigation of false signals places a significant burden on the staff resources. Therefore, alarm thresholds should be set based on explicit utility considerations that attempt to optimize the tradeoff between the cost of false alarms and the expected benefits of earlier detection.[25]",
