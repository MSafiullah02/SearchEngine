            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide public health problem, which is estimated to chronically infect approximately 240 million individuals [1], [2]. Chronic HBV infection elevates the risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [3], [4], [5]. Current clinical treatments for HBV infection include interferons (IFN)s and nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) [6], [7], [8]. IFN\u03b1 and its pegylated form (PegIFN\u03b1) modulate host immune response to viral infection and directly inhibit HBV replication in hepatocytes. NAs, including adefovir, entecavir (ETV), lamivudine, telbivudine, and tenofovir, suppress HBV replication by inhibiting reverse transcription. These agents significantly improve the progression of HBV-associated pathogenesis; however, they rarely lead to complete elimination of HBV from infected cells. Treatment studies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have shown that multidrug cocktails can greatly improve the clinical outcome [9], [10]. To achieve better anti-HBV treatment in the future, the development of new anti-HBV agents targeting different steps of the HBV life cycle, and their application to multidrug treatment are needed.",

            "text": "Cyclosporin A (CsA), a well-known immunosuppressive agent classified as a calcineurin (CN) inhibitor, is clinically used for prevention of graft rejection after organ transplantation [11], [12]. CsA primarily targets cellular peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase cyclophilins (CyPs), and suppresses their enzymatic activity. The resulting CsA/CyP complex subsequently binds CN to inhibit its phosphatase activity, which in turn inactivates NF-AT, an essential transcription factor for immune responses. In addition to this primary activity of CyPs- and CN inhibition, CsA is also reported to inhibit the transporter activity of membrane transporter families [13]. Thus far, CsA has been reported to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses, including HIV, HCV, HBV, herpesviruses, dengue virus, West Nile virus, human papillomavirus, and coronaviruses [14], [15]. In most of these cases, CyP-inhibition is the principal mechanism of the antiviral activity, as CyPs play a critical role in the viral life cycles. We, and other groups, have recently reported that CsA inhibits HBV entry through targeting a membrane transporter, sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) [16], [17], [18].",

            "text": "HBV enters into hepatocytes via specific interaction of the preS1 region in the HBV large surface protein with NTCP, a recently identified HBV entry receptor [19]. NTCP is specifically expressed on the hepatic basolateral membranes and functions for co-transporting bile acids with sodium ions into hepatocytes [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Identification of NTCP as an HBV receptor raises the entry process as an attractive target for drug development [26]. By inhibiting the entry step, subsequent formation of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a persistent viral reservoir that is difficult to eliminate by the current treatment, will be prevented. To date, several compounds have been reported to inhibit HBV infection by targeting NTCP, including myrcludex-B, irbesartan, ezetimibe, ritonavir, vanitaracin A, and bile acids in addition to CsA [17], [18], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. However, all of these drugs can also inhibit the transporter function of NTCP and impair the sodium-dependent bile acid uptake, which may induce significant adverse effects: NTCP-deficient mice, and a patient carrying a defective polymorphism mutation in NTCP, exhibit an elevated level of serum bile acids, and develop the related pathologies including growth retardation and hypercholanemia [32], [33]. Thus, it is a significant challenge to identify a compound that specifically inhibits HBV infection by targeting NTCP, without any effect on bile acid uptake.",

Importantly, these compounds are effective against entry of multiple HBV genotypes and a clinically relevant NA-resistant HBV isolate. Non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives, such as alisporivir, NIM811, and SCY-635, have been developed as anti-HCV candidates in clinical trial to phase II and III [14], [34], [35].

To characterize the activity of these new CsA derivatives, we evaluated the effect of each derivative on the inhibitory activity against CN and CyPA. As shown in Table 1\n, some of the compounds including SCY806, SCY651, SCY446, SCY198, SCY450, SCY453, SCY995, SCY506, and SCY640 lost the ability for CN inhibition, indicating the elimination of immunosuppressive activity (Table 1). Further, derivatives such as SCY446, SCY198, SCY450, and SCY453 showed very weak or no binding to CyPA (Table 1). Drugs that cause immunosuppression may promote virus infection/replication in patients [40], so it is desirable that immunosuppression should be eliminated from new agents. Based on these results, we then focused on four CsA derivatives in the following study, including SCY806, SCY446, SCY450, and SCY995, which showed high anti-HBV activity but with no immunosuppressive ability.",

NTCP transporter activity was evaluated with HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells (Fig. 5\nA) and primary human hepatocytes (Fig. 5B) in the presence or absence of an excess amount of CsA or its derivatives (10 \u03bcM) using [3H]-labeled taurocholic acid (TCA) as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 5A, a preS1 peptide and CsA decreased the sodium-dependent TCA uptake, which indicated NTCP transporter inhibitory activity, in HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells, as reported previously [41], [42], [45] (Fig. 5A, dark blue bars). Among CsA derivatives, SCY446 showed an apparent reduction of the TCA uptake, while SCY806, SCY450, and SCY995 did not significantly affect NTCP activity (Fig. 5A, dark blue bars). In primary human hepatocytes, SCY806, in addition to SCY446, within the SCY series significantly reduced the bile acid uptake (Fig. 5B). The dose-response curves for inhibition of NTCP transporter activity indicate that SCY446 dramatically impaired the bile acid uptake as the case with CsA, while SCY995 did not show significant effect on the transport (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. 5). Although there is still possibility that SCY995 can inhibit NTCP transporter at higher concentrations, it was clearly shown that the activity of SCY995 to NTCP transporter, if any, was much lower than CsA or SCY446 (IC50: 1.49, 1.92, and >25 \u03bcM for CsA, SCY446, and SCY995, respectively). The above results reveal two types of anti-HBV entry inhibitors: those impairing bile acid uptake and those minimally affecting transporter function. This effect was not likely to be due to the enhancement of NTCP endocytosis, as these CsA derivatives did not apparently change the cell surface localization of NTCP (Supplementary Fig. 6C\u2013F).",

To further confirm whether the function for bile acid transport and the capacity to support HBV entry can be distinguishable, we searched for compounds that bind NTCP and inhibit its function as a bile acid transporter but cannot inhibit HBV infection. Sulfobromophthalein is known to function as a substrate of NTCP that interacts with the bile acid pocket of NTCP [46]. As shown in Fig. 6\nA and Supplementary Fig. 7, sulfobromophthalein impaired the bile acid uptake in sodium-containing but not sodium-free condition in HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells, and it did not affect bile acid uptake of NTCP-deficient HepG2 cells. This suggests that sulfobromophthalein inhibited the NTCP-mediated bile acid transport, as reported previously [47] (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. 7). However, this compound did not inhibit HBV infection under the same concentration conditions (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, depletion of sodium inactivated the bile acid transport mediated by NTCP (Fig. 6C), but the activity to support HBV infection was still present (Fig. 6D), as reported previously [45]. These data demonstrate that the two functions of NTCP, transporting bile acids and supporting HBV infection, can be separated, which favors the concept of developing HBV entry inhibitors without affecting the bile acid transport.",

However, all of these agents have the potential to inhibit the function of NTCP for uptake of bile acids into hepatocytes. Although the IC50 of myrcludex-B for inhibiting the NTCP transporter is less than that for HBV entry inhibition, and it is thus possible to seek the window to inhibit HBV infection without significant loss of transporter function [49], other small molecules shown above have similar IC50 for inhibiting the transporter to those for HBV inhibition. Therefore, seeking small molecules that inhibit HBV infection without affecting the NTCP transporter activity is one of the major challenges of exploiting entry inhibition as a safe and effective therapy for HBV.",

            "text": "Previously, point mutation analyses within the NTCP gene suggested a close relationship between its transporter activity and the viral receptor function. Any substitution of amino acid residues related to the transporter function, including sodium binding (Q68, S105, N106, E257, and Q261), or bile acid binding (N262, Q293, and L294), were found to reduce or completely abolish the capacity of NTCP to bind preS1 and support HBV entry [45]. These results suggested that the residues essential for the transporter function are also utilized by HBV for entry into host cells. In addition, previously reported inhibitors of NTCP transport activity were found to reduce the capacity of NTCP to support HBV infection. Until now, there is no report clearly demonstrating that the two functionalities of NTCP can be distinguished. The possible mode of mechanism for cyclosporins-NTCP interaction is discussed in the Supplementary note of the Supplementary materials. In the present study, we identified CsA derivatives (SCY450 and SCY995) that can inhibit HBV entry without affecting the NTCP transport activity, with equivalent, or even higher, anti-entry activity than the parental CsA. Thus, by minimizing the side-effect on NTCP function in bile acid transport, it is possible to develop compounds with acceptable side-effect profiles. Strong support for the concept of separating the antiviral activity of a compound from its inhibitory effects on the original function of the receptor is found among antiviral drugs against HIV. Maraviroc and TAK-220 both target an HIV coreceptor CCR5 and inhibit HIV entry with comparable potencies. While Maraviroc also inhibits the binding of CCR5 to its cognate ligands (RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2) [50], TAK-220 does not affect binding of CCR5 to MIP-1\u03b2 [51]. CsA is also reported to have a potential but weak to inhibit the activity of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), also known as NTCP2, another family transporter working for bile acid uptake [52]. Consistently, SCY450 and SCY995, as well as CsA, did not show significant reductions in ABST transporter by 10 \u03bcM (Supplementary Fig. 8), excluding the possibilities that these two derivatives are more potent ASBT inhibitors than CsA.",

Further in depth derivative analyses, including the antiviral activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic and dynamic properties in vivo, are expected.",
