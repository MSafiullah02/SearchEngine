Uro-oncological consultations for newly diagnosed cancers and follow-up were more than halved or almost suspended, in 55% and 71% of centers, respectively. Prostate biopsies were reduced by 62%, with an average decrease of 23 biopsies per month. Given the aggressive nature of urothelial cancers, the restriction for transurethral resections of bladder tumors was smaller but still significant (46%), with a mean decrease of 12 procedures per month. In March 2020, a dramatic reduction was seen in major uro-oncological surgeries across Europe: radical prostatectomies, radical cystectomies, radical/partial nephrectomies, and nephroureterectomies decreased by 53%, 41%, 53%, and 52%, respectively. The majority of radical prostatectomies nowadays are performed with the robotic technique at referral centers, but the restrictions have specifically affected the access to the robot [4]. Centers estimate that >50% of uro-oncological procedures will have a delay well beyond 30 d from diagnosis, which is the recommended time frame within which newly diagnosed cases should definitely be treated [5].",

After the end of the COVID-19 crisis, health systems will have to develop strategies to catch up with these delays. Given similar reduction rates from normal activity to what was seen in March, we tried to estimate the medical working capacity, which would be needed in order to absorb uro-oncological interventions that have been postponed second to the pandemic. The result has been derived from random simulation of monthly reductions in each type of intervention, as well in their total, based on the statistical distribution of survey reduction rates.",

As surgical volumes of each institution cannot increase beyond a certain point, this will be a challenging but important issue to be addressed, specifically as the access to resources will be phased and competitive. In the meantime, delays in the waiting list might also have important implications in terms of patient anxiety and related depression.",

However, we provide a first timely estimate of the indirect effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the uro-oncological care based on real-time, first-hand reports of urological case patterns in Europe. In the time of crisis, uro-oncological surgeries should be centralized in tertiary urological centers that should ideally remain COVID-19\u2013free sanctuaries, to guarantee high-quality, timely, and safe treatments to oncological patients. The health care fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic will surely be measured by the direct morbidity/mortality of the virus as well as the secondary effect that will include significant harm from delay of urgent oncological therapies, including surgeries.",
