            "text": "Two important problems regarding spreading phenomena in complex topologies are the optimal selection of node sets either to minimize or maximize the extent of outbreaks. Both problems are nontrivial when a small fraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal. The minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The \"superblockers,\" i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components as small as possible. \"Superspreaders\" are instead the nodes such that, if chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world networks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of superspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent: superblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.",

Processes mediated by disordered interaction patterns are affected by the topological properties of the underlying graph in nontrivial ways [1] [2] [3] . Spreading phenomena are among the most fundamental and studied types of dynamics occurring on networks [4] . In this context, a natural question, with implications for practical applications, is the following: given a network and a spreading dynamics on top of it, how can we identify the set of n \"superspreaders,\" i.e., the n vertices such that, if the spreading process is initiated simultaneously by all of them, the average number of nodes reached by the spreading event is maximal? This problem is often indicated also as \"influence maximization,\" in particular in computer science, where fundamental results have been derived [5, 6] .",

            "text": "In their seminal work on the problem of optimal percolation [7] , Morone and Makse hinted a strong connection between the identification problems of superspreaders and superblockers. The paper effectively describes the problem of identifying superblockers, but it always refers to superblockers as they were optimal spreaders, suggesting that essentially the two sets coincide. The analogy between superblockers and superspreaders may sound plausible from some point of view: it is natural to expect that both superblockers and superspreaders will be found among the nodes with largest connectivity. On the other hand, a conspicuous difference between the two problems is that optimal percolation depends only on the topological structure, while influence maximization depends (at least in principle) on the type of spreading process considered and on the detailed value of the parameters describing it. In Ref. [7] , caveats about the distinction between the two problems are put forward, specifying that the mapping between influence maximization and optimal percolation is exact only for the linear threshold model with a very particular choice of the thresholds. A similar approach, based purely on topological information, has been recently used also for more general choices of the threshold [12] . For different types of spreading models, such as, for example, those belonging to the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) class, methods relying on the mapping to the optimal percolation problem are not a priori granted to work. Nonetheless, the idea that superspreaders and superblockers are equivalent in arbitrary spreading models has been rapidly adopted without further scrutiny [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (Ref. [8] being an exception); this calls for a deeper and more careful investigation.",

We use also a simplified version of the algorithm by Clusella et al., where node scores are not computed iteratively but they are set equal to their degree. This modification of the algorithm by Clusella et al. reduces slightly its performance, but it allows us to treat all networks in the same manner, without the need to determine additional ad hoc parameter values for every specific network.

We will therefore use the methods by Morone and Makse, and by Clusella et al. to assign nodes with a rank ranging from 1 to N . In one case, the order of the nodes will be established as the inverse order in which they are added in the algorithm by Clusella et al. In the other case instead, it will coincide with the order in which nodes are removed from the network according to the collective influence score. We will measure the agreement, as a function of \u03c1 = n/N , between the set S (x) of best n superblockers found by methods devised to optimally destroy a network and the set S (C) of the best n superspreaders identified by a method specifically deployed for their identification (see below).

This model is commonly considered in studies of influence maximization by computer scientists. One starts from a set S (of size n) of initially activated nodes at time t = 0. All other nodes are instead initially set as inactive. At each discrete time step t, two rules are applied in sequence: (i) each activated node i contacts all its neighbors j and, with an independent probability p, tries to activate each of those nodes that have been never activated during previous stages of the dynamics; (ii) all nodes that tried to activate their neighbors at step (i) become inactive, and they cannot be activated again in subsequent stages of the dynamics. The process is iterated until no more active nodes are present. This dynamics is a parallel version of the common SIR model [4] for epidemic spreading, with the time to recover fixed deterministically to 1.",

In a nutshell, the problem is the following: given a network of size N and a spreading dynamics on top of it, a set S of initially active nodes generates a cascade (outbreak) of average size R(S). We will denote R(S) also as \"spreading power\" of set S. Influence maximization aims at identifying, among all subsets of size n, the subset S * for which R(S) is maximal. The seminal paper by Kempe et al. [6] has shown that the influence maximization problem is computationally hard (NP-complete). However, the same paper provides, for the broad class of submodular dynamics (including the ICM), a greedy algorithm able to find a suboptimal solution, provably within 63% of the optimum [6] . More precisely, by adding at each time step to S the node that maximizes the marginal increment of R, one is guaranteed that R(S) (1 \u2212 1/e)R(S * ), where e is the base of the natural logarithm.",

In such a case one would conclude that the search for the best blockers effectively uncovers a set of almost optimal spreaders. To compare the spreading power of superblockers and of superspreaders, we consider the ratio R(S (x) ,\u03c1)/R(S (C) ,\u03c1).

We test this hypothesis in Fig. 4 , where we plot, as a function of \u03c1, the Jaccard distance among sets of optimal spreaders for sub-, super-, and critical values of p. Interestingly, the sets of optimal spreaders for subcritical and critical evolution are quite similar, while they are very different from the optimal set of spreaders in the supercritical regime. Whether a set of nodes has large spreading power crucially depends on p. Any attempt to relate sets of optimal spreaders to sets determined only by topology is ill-fated.",

More in detail, our results indicate that the nodes whose removal leads to the breakdown of the topology into nonextensive components do not coincide with the best nodes for seeding a spreading process. Even the plain degree centrality identifies better spreaders than the methods aimed at identifying superblockers. In addition, as the identity of the optimal spreaders is strongly dependent on the parameter that regulates the dynamics, attempts to identify sets of superspreaders based only on topological properties without reference to the details of the spreading dynamics are bound to fail.",

            "text": "With the benefit of hindsight these results appear rather easy to be anticipated: the choice of optimal seeds depends on the spreading dynamics (and its parameters) while optimal blocking does not. As most recent papers in the field have implicitly assumed the validity of this conjecture [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , we believe that a detailed verification was in order. The minimization and the maximization of the extent of spreading processes mediated by complex topologies are both exciting examples of the nontrivial interplay between structure and function. They are deservedly attracting a huge interest in statistical physics, computer science, and other communities. The interest on these issues is by no means reduced by the awareness that they are fundamentally different problems.",
