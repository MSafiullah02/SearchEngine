These studies quantified transmission probabilities using a negative binomial offspring distribution within a branching process outbreak model, assuming that every infected individual transmits with an average of R\n0 transmissions and dispersion parameter k, where k\n < 1 implies high over-dispersion (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005).",

The ROK outbreak consisted of a large number of transmissions from the initial traveler and from a few patients in the next transmission generation. Then, once local officials determined that a MERS outbreak was occurring and implemented control measures in response, there was an extremely rapid decrease in transmissions such that the entire outbreak was extinguished after three total generations of transmission following the introduction (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). This type of differential transmissibility before vs. after implementation of control measures has also been observed during localized outbreaks of SARS (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) and Ebola (Toth et al., 2015, Shuaib et al., 2014).",

We hypothesized that a model allowing this type of switch would produce a substantially better fit to the data from outbreak clusters caused by MERS importations. Given results from our previous work assessing Ebola importation risk (Toth et al., 2015), we also hypothesized that this model might produce substantially different results for the risk of a very large outbreak compared to a model assuming a single reproductive number across all transmission generations.",

Model-derived probabilities of an outbreak exceeding a given total number of transmissions (A, C, E) or total number of transmission generations (B, D, F). Dashed = Model 0, assuming no change in transmission parameters (reproductive number and dispersion parameter) across generations; dotted = Model 1b, assuming the transmission parameters change after one generation of transmission; solid = Model 2b (the optimal model), assuming the transmission parameters change after two generations of transmission. Panels A and B use MLE parameters derived assuming there were no undetected importation clusters beyond those listed in Table 1. Panels C and D assuming 50% of importation clusters were undetected. Panels E and F assuming 75% of importation clusters were undetected.",
