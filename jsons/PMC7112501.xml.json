Traditional medical care tends to focus on the biological impact of such diseases, as well as on infection control. As attention has shifted from infectious diseases to other chronic medical illnesses over the past few decades, our knowledge of the psychological impact of disease outbreaks has become underdeveloped. The occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the 21st century has rekindled concern for this neglected area.",

The disease spread rapidly to over 30 countries, with more than 8000 reported cases, and resulted in 774 deaths worldwide [2]. The places that were most affected included Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Toronto. In Hong Kong, the SARS epidemic began in March 2003. It affected up to 1755 individuals and caused 299 deaths. Understandably, SARS survivors, being the direct victims of this deadly infectious disease, were most affected. Confronted with this novel deadly infectious disease, the experience of witnessing adverse events during hospitalisation, uncertainty regarding one's prognosis and the need for ICU care all constituted a terrifying experience for SARS victims [3].",

The main problems involved adjustment reactions with increased anxiety levels [4], [5], [6], [7]. Studies showed that 10\u201335% of SARS survivors reported having features of anxiety, depression or both during the early recovery phase [3], [8], [9]. Other studies examined the features of post-traumatic stress reactions in SARS survivors in the early postdischarge period [3], [10]. A series of studies using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) revealed that 45% of the respondents had at least one active diagnosable psychiatric disorder at 2 to 4 weeks after discharge [11]. Persistent psychopathologies such as major depression (23.6%), adjustment disorder (8.1%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (7.3%) were also noted at 6 months postdischarge [12]. However, the reliability, validity and generalisation of the above studies are limited by low response rates of 28% to 65% [3], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], the sole reliance on self-administered instruments [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [10] and the use of convenience sampling methods.",

The SCID [15] is a clinician-administered, semistructured interview used for diagnosing major Axis I DSM-IV diagnoses [16]. The output of the SCID is a record of the presence or absence of each of the disorders being considered, for both the current episode (past month) and lifetime occurrence. Because of the difficulty in making a reliable diagnosis for general anxiety disorder and adjustment disorders, the SCID allows only the current diagnoses of these two disorders to be made. So et al.

Concurrent validity has been demonstrated by the moderate to strong relationship between the IES-R and the subscales of the PTSD Checklist (Pearson's correlation between 0.62 and 0.83, with P<.001) [21]. A mean subscale score of 2, representing a moderate level of distress, was chosen as the cut-off point [20], [22]. The Chinese HADS [23], [24] consists of two independent scores that are calculated for anxiety and depression. Concurrent validity has been demonstrated by the close correlation with both the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression and Hamilton Rating Scale of Anxiety (Pearson's coefficient=0.67 and 0.63, respectively; P<.001) [25]. A score of 11 was used as the cut-off point for each subscale to reflect a moderate level of distress [24].

            "text": "The cumulative incidence rate of PTSD 30 months after SARS (47.8%) can be regarded as a crude approximation of the lifetime prevalence, although underestimation may be possible. The SARS outbreak has created a range of psychiatric conditions similar to that created by other traumatic events [30]. PTSD, depressive disorders and other anxiety spectrum disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder and social phobia) were detected. The high rates of psychiatric morbidities can also be shown using subjective ratings, such as the HADS and the IES-R. Among the subjects who suffered from any psychiatric conditions at 30 months post-SARS, one-half still had comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. This high level of psychiatric comorbidity was comparable to that obtained in the SARS outcome studies in the acute stage [12], as well as that reported in other trauma studies [31], [32]. Similar to evidence from the acute phase studies [33], [34], [35], this study showed that the lower quality of life seen among SARS survivors, as measured by the SF-36, persisted. Hence, the SARS outbreak in 2003 should not simply be regarded as a medical event but also as a mental health catastrophe with a response compatible to that of other major disasters [36], [37], [38]. There are several factors that account for the high rate of psychiatric morbidities. Patients were confronted with a highly contagious novel virus that required compulsory isolation treatment and administration of experimental drugs [39]. There were imminent threats to their life and physical health as well as fears of cross-infection to family and friends. Patients may have experienced loss if they had family members or friends killed by SARS or the threat of loss even if family members or friends were infected and then recovered [9]. As compared with other disasters (natural or man-made), the nature of this threat was extremely unpredictable because SARS was a novel virus. The duration of threat exposure was prolonged as evidenced by lengthy hospitalisations and the 3-month period that was required for our community to adequately manage the outbreak threat. Furthermore, the psychological damage may have been intensified by social support systems being immobilised by isolation and stigmatisation. The ongoing subsequent biopsychosocial challenges (i.e., functional impairment, pain, fatigue, unemployment and bereavement) may have complicated the situation further. Although the lungs are the key organ involved in SARS [40], the majority of patients have recovered lung function parameters. Though lung function was recovered, many patients were given high-dose steroid therapy, which may have lead to the subsequent complication of AVN [41]. Finally, there is emerging evidence concerning the role of neuroendocrine, neurostructural and neuroimmunological disturbances in psychiatric disorders such as depression and PTSD [32], [42], [43]. Hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that either neurobiological disturbances brought about by high-dose steroid treatment, inflammation secondary to SARS infection or the direct effect of the virus on the central nervous system caused various neuropsychological consequences [44], [45].",

The use of alcohol as a means of coping may be inhibited by the biologically determined lack of tolerance to alcohol in Asian and Oriental cultures [49]. Alternatively, this maladaptive coping mechanism may be less prominent in a disaster involving a medical disease with possible long-term physical complications. The fact that alcohol consumption is one of the contributing factors to AVN may deter subjects from using alcohol for self-medication of posttraumatic stress symptoms [50]. Furthermore, our subjects could have been more health conscious given that 30% of our sample was composed of HCWs. This percentage of HCWs may have resulted in a lower risk of subsequent substance- or alcohol-related problems. Hence, there may be dynamic interactions among characteristics of the survivors, the nature of the traumatic event and the psycho-behavioural responses to a stressor.",

Second, consistent with other trauma studies [31], [51], [52], this study reported lower PTSD recovery rates compared with that of major depressive disorder. The constellation of PTSD symptoms may be more persistent than the symptoms of depressive disorders [32], [51]. Third, it is possible that depressive disorders represent a more severe form of adjustment problems that may improve gradually with time.

Despite the extensive long-term psychiatric morbidities, more than one-third of the subjects with persistent psychiatric problems had never received proper specialist help before.

Mental health professionals should be more proactive and be considered part of the multidisciplinary team that manages SARS or other infectious disease outbreaks [12]. Finally, for pandemic planning, the likelihood of prolonged subjective distress and occupational difficulties in a substantial percentage of HCWs should be factored into surge capacity modelling during and after the pandemic [55]. Further longitudinal follow-up studies of SARS survivors should be conducted to evaluate the course of psychiatric consequences. Multicentre or even cross-country research should be actively encouraged so as to increase the power of research studies and explore cultural differences. The psychological effects of the disease outbreak on other at-risk populations (e.g., victims' families) and their correlation with the patient's psychological health should also be determined. The impact of the threat or actual loss of family members and friends due to the disease outbreak should be explored. In case of an unfortunate future massive outbreak, a prospective study with an early baseline and longitudinal assessment should also be adopted. Research networks with protocols and instruments that have been preselected and propositioned should be established well before the occurrence of a massive outbreak in order to avoid chaotic conditions that may pose various constraints to further studies.",

We should not forget the lessons learned through SARS, as they have taught us much concerning the management of future comparable infectious disease epidemics (e.g., avian influenza).
