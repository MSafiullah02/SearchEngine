Although 48 confirmed cases of rabies among international travelers have been reported since 1990, travel-associated rabies is likely to be underreported among travelers who die abroad [12]. The incidence of injuries caused by potentially rabid animals is 15.4 injuries per 1,000 expatriates per year of stay [13]. Furthermore, two thirds of rabies cases occurred in those traveling for \u22653 months [12]. Despite this risk, only 31 % of expatriates report receiving a pretravel rabies vaccination [13]. The often-prohibitive cost of a rabies vaccination\u2014coupled with inadequate traveler knowledge regarding rabies risk and insufficient time to complete vaccination prior to departure\u2014has been cited as a reason for low preexposure rabies vaccination rates among long-term travelers [12\u201315]. Analyses of rabies vaccine prices demonstrated an inverse relationship between vaccination uptake and vaccine cost [13]. An intradermal (ID) rabies vaccination costs one third of the price of an intramuscular (IM) rabies vaccine and has been shown to be safe and immunogenic. However, its use in pretravel clinics is limited by off-label restrictions in the U.S., Australia, and several European countries and by the need for follow-up serologic testing to document immunity [12]. A modified schedule consisting of two ID injections (on days 0 and 7, with follow-up serology on days 21\u201328) was studied as a potential alternative to IM injections in an Australian travel clinic [15]. Travelers who received the modified ID schedule had a similar immunogenicity response, as compared with those receiving the standard ID schedule.",

Another meta-analysis of nine TD antibiotic prophylaxis studies showed a similar protective effect for fluoroquinolones and rifaximin (pooled relative risk estimate of 0.33, 95 % CI 0.24\u20130.45 for rifaximin and 0.12, 95 % CI 0.07\u20130.20 for fluoroquinolones) [29].

Poor adherence to antimalarials among long-term expatriates suggests that adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis might be similarly suboptimal, but with greater potential for widespread resistance.

The previously referenced studies highlight the increased risks of gastrointestinal disorders, malaria, LTBI, rabies, STIs, and psychiatric illness among expatriates. A thorough, individualized assessment based on destination, occupation, planned risk-taking behavior, and preexisting health conditions will inform pretravel vaccination and advice. Gaps in our knowledge of expatriate health should be addressed, and further research will serve to enhance the effectiveness of pretravel visits for expatriate travelers.",
