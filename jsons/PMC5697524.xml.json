            "text": "Several T cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for the control of viral infections and play key roles in vaccine-induced antiviral immunity. Thus, accurate quantification of specific T cell responses is a focus of interest to understand protective immunity and to investigate vaccine efficacy. Studies of antigen-specific T cells may comprise functional analyses ex vivo after activating the cells with recall antigen. The lymphocyte activation can then be evaluated by different methods using functional read-outs, such as proliferation, expression of surface activation markers, or cytokine production (Thiel et al., 2004). To detect cytokine producing cells the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) technique is a particularly useful method, which simultaneously allows visualisation of single cells, their cytokine production, frequency and phenotype. This method is based on antigen-activation of leukocyte cultures in the presence of a secretion inhibitor prior to combined surface and intracellular staining followed by flow cytometry analysis (Suni et al., 1998).",

            "text": "ICS has been extensively used in human medical research, to address antigen-specific T cell responses in settings such as experimental vaccination. Quantification of the number of T cells, which produce the effector cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, in response to recall stimulation, has been a particularly popular method for years. However, it has been shown that vaccination in humans generates a broad and complex T cell cytokine response (De Rosa et al., 2004). Hence, proper evaluation of the response will therefore require coordinate measurements of several cytokines, which makes ICS and polychromatic flow cytometry invaluable tools. The ICS method is not yet widely used in avian immunology research and only a few published reports exist (Ariaans et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2011, Ruiz-Hernandez et al., 2015), an example being a methodological study describing ICS applied to study IFN-\u03b3 production in polyclonal stimulated splenocytes (Ariaans et al., 2008). Furthermore, only a few antibodies specific for chicken IFN-\u03b3 (chIFN-\u03b3) are currently commercially available (Table 1). In other domestic species such as pigs and cattle, the ICS method has been used with success in differentiating cells based on phenotypic and cytokine profile following polyclonal stimulation and antigen specific stimulation (Sassu et al., 2017, Sopp and Howard, 2001). The purpose of the present study was therefore to further evaluate, optimise and develop protocols for analyses of the chicken cellular response of not only polyclonal stimulation but also antigen-specific stimulation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) specific T cells.",

In the present study, NDV specific immune responses were induced in chickens using a vaccination model. Live attenuated (LA) and inactivated (IA) NDV vaccines are commercially available and while both types of vaccine formulations induce antibody responses LA NDV vaccines are considered better inducers of cellular immunity (Al-Garib et al., 2003, Zoth et al., 2008, Lambrecht et al., 2004, Rauw et al., 2009, Jayawardane and Spradbrow, 1995). A number of studies in poultry have shown that IFN-\u03b3 produced by T cells after ex vivo stimulation correlate with cellular immunity after vaccination or infection (Breed et al., 1997, Karaca et al., 1996, Martin et al., 1994, Prowse and Pallister, 1989). NDV-specific cell-mediated immunity induced by live vaccines was earlier demonstrated in peripheral blood and spleen by ex vivo recall stimulation and assessment of chicken IFN-\u03b3 production by capture ELISA and ELISPOT (Ariaans et al., 2008, Lambrecht et al., 2004, Rauw et al., 2009, Rauw et al., 2010). In the present work, we optimised and evaluated an ICS method for assessment of specific T cell responses in peripheral blood from NDV vaccinated chickens by quantification and phenotypic characterisation of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells.",

Different laboratories have different procedures for staining cells for FACS analysis and the rationale for incubating cells on ice/4\u00b0C is to avoid unspecific staining either caused by cells endocytosing the staining antibodies or binding via Fc receptors. Hence, we sought to investigate the ability of avian phagocytes and lymphocytes to endocytose or bind mouse IgG aspecifically, and whether staining conditions affected staining frequencies by flow cytometry. Using highly phagocytic cells, i.e. BMDC, and a mixture of various cell populations, i.e. PBMC, cell staining on ice or at RT and in the presence of PBS or PBS/azide was analysed by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 1). For PBMC (Fig. S1A) or BMDC (Fig. S1B) stained under the various conditions neither the reference (B, T and phagocytic cells) nor the mouse isotype IgG staining frequencies were affected significantly by buffer composition or temperature conditions. Cell staining with PBS alone gave higher cell percentages compared to PBS/azide potentially indicating unspecific staining and using a conjugated antibody gave consistent cell frequencies between the different buffers compared to indirect cell staining. When we compared the staining of highly phagocytic cells, BMDC, with unconjugated and conjugated isotype controls there was little differences in their binding capacity indicating that the unconjugated antibody is not endocytosed before addition of the secondary antibody. The slight increase in unconjugated mouse IgG binding may possibly be due to the unspecific binding of the secondary antibody. In conclusion, staining avian lymphocytes at RT with PBS did not significantly alter surface staining or enhance the uptake or binding of mouse IgG and was therefore used in further analysis.",

After overnight stimulation with 10 \u03bcg/ml of ConA in the presence of 5 \u03bcg/ml of BFA, it was shown that if cells were harvested with 2 mM of EDTA, increased frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were detected. As expected, stimulation with 10 \u03bcg/ml of ConA, in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml of BFA for 6 h, produced a lower IFN-\u03b3 response as compared to the overnight ConA stimulation and BFA treatment. To test for unspecific intracellular staining of primary and secondary antibodies, additional controls were included. PBMC staining was performed using an irrelevant rabbit polyclonal antibody (Rabbit anti chicken IgG FITC) or secondary goat anti rabbit IgG FITC without primary antibody (Supplementary Fig. 2). No unspecific staining was observed, however some CD8\u2212 cells stained positive as expected, probably due to IgG bound to the surface of B-cells.",

This is in agreement with previous results obtained by chIFN-\u03b3 capture ELISA analyses of the supernatant of polyclonal-stimulated splenocytes in which no significant differences were observed between naive and NDV-vaccinated chickens (Lambrecht et al., 2004). Interestingly, not all IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were found to be surface CD3+ (Fig. 4A) suggesting IFN-\u03b3 is produced by other cell types. This is a well-known issue in mammalian research when using IFN-\u03b3 release assays. Several investigators have suggested that not only T cells produce IFN-\u03b3 following overnight stimulation with mitogen or antigen (Hagiwara et al., 1995, Vitale et al., 2000). Indeed, Desombere et al., 2004, Desombere et al., 2005 reported that overnight stimulation of human PBMC led to IFN-\u03b3 produced majorly by NK cells whereas after 5-days of stimulation most IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were T lymphocytes. However, in chickens, as opposed to mammals, the population of NK cells in blood constitutes only around 1% of peripheral lymphocytes (Neulen et al., 2015). The identity of the CD3 negative IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in the current study remains unknown at present. Due to well-known issues regarding changes in forward/side scatter profiles of PBMC after fixation, we cannot exclude the possibility that our lymphocyte gate contain monocytes and that they form part of the CD3 negative IFN-\u03b3 producing population. It is also possible that the CD3\u2212 IFN-\u03b3 producing population contains thrombocytes. Avian thrombocytes are nucleated platelets forming a large part of peripheral blood (Seliger et al., 2012) and have been shown to have roles in inflammation and antimicrobial defence (Scott and Owens, 2008, Ferdous and Scott, 2015, Ferdous et al., 2016). However, it is controversial for how long thrombocytes survive in culture. Kaspers and Kaiser (2014) state that these cells die at 48\u201372 h. DaMatta et al. (1999) shows that about 70% of the thrombocytes dies by apoptosis by 24 h and 85% by 48 h. Certainly, thrombocyte cytokine gene expression was reported up to 18 h in culture (St Paul et al., 2012). In conclusion, further ICS studies are needed using specific thrombocyte and monocyte marker antibodies to define the observed CD3 negative population.",

It has been reported that chicken \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are poor cytokine producers and dependent on \u03b1\u03b2 T cells for their activation and proliferation (Kasahara et al., 1993). The present study showed, however, that 2\u201316% of the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were able to produce IFN-\u03b3 upon ConA stimulation. In another experiment, we observed prominent expansion and blast transformation of TCR\u03b3\u03b4+CD8\u03b2+ splenocytes upon in vitro ConA stimulation in combination with TCR\u03b3\u03b4\u2212CD8\u03b2+ cells in the cultures showing 10-fold higher responses (unpublished observation). Thus, it seems that chicken TCR\u03b3\u03b4 cell populations may be activated by mitogenic substances and depending on the trait monitored with or without corresponding responses in the TCR\u03b1\u03b2 cell population. In conclusion, methods that enumerate cytokine producing cells without determining their phenotype e.g. by ELISPOT methodology should be interpreted with caution if the results are to indicate solely classic T lymphocyte activity.",

In mammals, PBMC or whole blood is widely used in recall assays as described in the current study. However, the antigen presentation potential of the PBMC samples were reported to be of importance in successful T cell activation ex vivo (Thiel et al., 2004). In general, exogenous antigens are easily processed by antigen-presenting cells and displayed as peptides of MHC-II molecules thus stimulating CD4+ T cell activation. In a study by Maecker et al., (2001), cross priming where peptides are displayed on MHC-I and presented to CD8+ T cells was also shown to occur. However, higher doses of whole protein were needed in order to observe stimulation efficiency comparable to that of synthetic peptides. Interestingly the ability to efficiently cross-prime was not found to be correlated to the number of dendritic cells in the donor\u2019s blood but rather the number of monocytes (Maecker et al., 2001). In chickens we have also reported the importance of monocytes in PBMC samples in order to obtain efficient CD8+ T cell stimulation (Dalgaard et al., 2016). Further, studies are needed in order to pinpoint the exact mechanisms and peripheral blood cell types involved in antigen presentation in chicken ex vivo T cell assays.",

However, this was only observed for B19 chickens and not for B21 chickens. This inbred chicken line was earlier used in a comparable NDV vaccination study where antigen-specific T cell responses were assessed by CFSE staining and proliferation analyses (Dalgaard et al., 2010b). PBMC from chickens (of both MHC haplotypes) immunised with live attenuated vaccine showed a significantly higher proliferative capacity upon virus-specific recall stimulation than naive MHC-matched controls. However, no significant differences between the two haplotypes were reported (Dalgaard et al., 2010b). Nevertheless, the contrasting results may reflect that proliferating T cells do not necessarily produce IFN-\u03b3 and vice versa. This was previously suggested by Lambrecht et al. (2004) when no close correlation was found between the proliferative response to mitogens and the IFN-\u03b3 production in chicken splenocyte cultures. The observed antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 production in CD3+TCR\u03b3\u03b4\u2212CD8+ cells of B19 chickens was only observed in the group vaccinated with the live attenuated vaccine and not in the group having received the inactivated vaccine. This was in good agreement with earlier reports demonstrating that live attenuated NDV vaccines induce a stronger CMI than inactivated NDV vaccines (Al-Garib et al., 2003, Zoth et al., 2008, Lambrecht et al., 2004, Rauw et al., 2009, Jayawardane and Spradbrow, 1995). However, the observation may not only reflect differences in the amount of circulating memory T cells induced by the vaccinations, but also differences in vaccine response kinetics and hence the possibility of identifying the NDV specific cells in peripheral blood. It should also be noted that recall stimulation using e.g. synthetic peptide pools or recombinant viral proteins may improve the methodology. The NDV antigen used in this study most likely, apart from viral protein/peptides, also contain unspecific stimuli, such as viral nucleic acids and other viral pathogen associated molecular patterns. Hence, the IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were not necessarily exclusively responding to NDV peptides presented by MHC. Interestingly, spontaneous IFN-\u03b3 production by unstimulated lymphocytes (medium controls) was earlier reported to be higher in samples from AIV infected chickens as compared to uninfected controls (Reemers et al., 2012). In general, we also observed large differences in the spontaneous IFN-\u03b3 production in medium controls between treatment groups, MHC type and sample time as previously reported in various species (Ariaans et al., 2009, Koets et al., 2006).",

The fact that the chickens e.g. lack draining lymph nodes as we know them from mammals further complicates a comparative approach. However, a few reports have established the presence of virus-specific memory T cells in both spleen and peripheral blood of chickens. Thus, Singh et al. (2010) reported assessment of ex vivo stimulated avian influenza virus specific peripheral T cells by their IFN-\u03b3 secretion (by NO inducing capacity in the HD11 cell line) and found cytokine producing capacity 3\u20139 weeks post a DNA vaccination. Likewise, Pei et al. (2003) reported the presence of Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV) specific T cells in the spleen 3\u20136 weeks after infection by assessment of their protective potential by adoptive transfer. In the future, assessment of chicken memory T cell biology will be aided by development of new MHC multimer reagents and identification of T cell activation and memory cell markers for detailed phenotyping of antigen-specific cells. In addition functional assays for assessment of combinations of parameters such as proliferative capacity, degranulation potential/CTL activity and ability to produce several cytokines in addition to IFN-\u03b3 will be key to progress in the field.",

Although ConA increased the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3+ cells, it is noteworthy that a large proportion of the IFN-\u03b3 producers were \u03b3\u03b4 T cells or even thrombocytes. Furthermore, the ICS method was used for assessment of NDV-specific T cell responses in a vaccination experiment and large variations between individuals were observed along with a non-specific background response in naive chickens. In order to further pursue antigen-specific responses, optimisation of the NDV antigen stimulation protocol must be done, e.g. by co-stimulation strategies or improved antigen presentation by APC enrichment. Furthermore, not only the magnitude but also the quality of a T cell response is important for protective immunity, as shown in mammalian studies (Seder et al., 2008). In the future, it will be necessary to address combinations of T cell functions in the chicken to identify valuable correlates of protection.",
