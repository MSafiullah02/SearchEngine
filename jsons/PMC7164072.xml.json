The calculated amount of aminopeptidase in microvillar membrane may explain the capacity of each aphid to feed on a diet containing lectins amounting to as much as 1 \u00b5g of ConA in 48 h [29]. Also immunohistochemical observations of lectin binding on the midgut demonstrated that the stomach (ventriculus 1) cell membranes are the primary target for ConA, followed by the intestine (remaining midgut chambers) cell membranes [29]. Activity measurements found APN along the midgut, and imunolocalization with APN antibodies showed that APN is associated with a specialized plasma membrane associated with the apical lamellae. These consist of a complex network of lamellae, linked one to another by trabecullae to resist the osmotic pressure caused by high\u2010sugar phloem\u2010sap ingestion [28]. The apical lamellae replace the regularly arranged microvilli observed in most midgut cells. APN localization data are in agreement with the lectin\u2010binding site found by Sauvion et al. [29].

APN is certainly responsible for the final digestion of peptides generated by cathepsin L. Another possibility is that APN is somehow associated with putative amino\u2010acid\u2010binding sites at the plasma membranes associated with the apical lamellae (modified perimicrovillar membranes). These are thought to increase the amino\u2010acid concentration (usually low in the aphid diet) [28], thus facilitating absorption. APN may also be directly linked to absorptive sites in apical lamellae, as has been suggested for Lepidoptera [42]. Finally, APN may serve as the primary digestive enzyme responsible for the assimilation of the phloem sap small peptide fraction, chemical components largely unexplored at the moment.",

However, none of the 2D PAGE protein spots observed in pea aphid homogenates as binding to ConBr was identified as corresponding to ferritin (F. A. Mendonca de Sousa & Y.

Consequently, this toxicity must result from lectin binding to target proteins in the apical membranes from the midgut, although not related to the inhibition of APN activity. One explanation of this effect is a decrease in amino\u2010acid absorption caused by ConA binding to APN, with deleterious effects on the putative associated proteins thought to bind to amino acids (see above). Indeed, ConA\u2010intoxicated aphids have been shown to display altered hemolymph free amino\u2010acid profiles and modified excretion of asparagine in their honeydew [47].
