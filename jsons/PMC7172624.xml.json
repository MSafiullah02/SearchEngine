In all these samples, except one, the presence of HRV was identified. It is noteworthy that in HRV infected infants episodes of cough were significantly lower in Linfovir\u00ae plus group in comparison to placebo group after 7 days of treatment. Moreover, TLR-2 mRNA level in HRV infected children treated with Linfovir\u00ae plus was significantly increased compared to HRV infected subjects of the placebo group at 48 h follow-up. Since it has been demonstrated that TLR-2 can be involved in the type I IFNs antiviral response upon binding of viral antigens to this pattern recognition receptor [39], our results suggest that Linfovir\u00ae plus could promote antiviral defense mainly through TLR-2 up-regulation.",
