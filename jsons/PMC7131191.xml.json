In 2003, only limited progress has been made toward that goal. This article assesses the reasons for that lack of progress, with specific reference to the dominant role played by the G8 (Group of 8) nations in the international economic and political order. In other words, it provides a \u201creport card\u201d on key health impacts and implications of G8 policies, with particular reference to effects in countries outside the industrialized world that account for roughly five-sixths of the world's population.",

The six countries originally included were France, the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan. Canada joined in 1976; the European Community (now the European Union) joined in 1977, but does not have the same status as national governments. Russia achieved partial membership in the group in 1998, and full membership as of 2003; thus, the G7 is now the G8. The G8 account for 46.6 percent of global GDP and 46.8 percent of global exports (International Monetary Fund, 2003, Table A). Perhaps more importantly, the G7 countries dominate World Bank and IMF decision making, and wield considerable power in the World Trade Organization (WTO) because the size of their markets and access to specialized expertise provide them with formidable bargaining advantages with respect to countries of the developing world.",

            "text": "Access to health care is only one factor amongst many affecting the health status of a population (Evans and Stoddart, 1990; Diderichsen, Evans, & Whitehead, 2001). For much of the world's population, ability to lead a healthy life is limited by direct and indirect effects of poverty. Almost half the world's people live on an income of $2 per day or less (World Bank, 2001, pp. 36\u201338). This figure has been criticized on methodological grounds as a substantial underestimate of the extent of absolute poverty (Reddy & Pogge, 2003), but clearly it describes complex and health-destructive vulnerabilities (Narayan, Chambers, Shah, & Petesch, 2000; Diderichsen, Evans, & Whitehead, 2001). Ill health not only results from poverty, but also can limit the ability of individuals, households and entire societies to escape from poverty. \u201c[F]or the poor their body is often their only asset, and when the body is weakened through hunger, illness and accidents, an entire family can plunge into destitution\u201d (Narayan, 2001, p. 15; see generally Narayan, Chambers, Shah, & Petesch, 2000). The potential contribution to economic development of low-cost interventions to improve health was a central theme of the work of the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2001). Conversely, the impacts of HIV/AIDS and malaria provide especially dramatic, large-scale illustrations of the economic damage that can result from poor health (Haacker, 2002; Sachs & Malaney, 2002).",

The term is a convenient way of describing the growing interconnectedness of the world's economies and societies. Some observers regard globalization as a \u201cprocess of closer interaction of human activities across a range of spheres including economic, political, social and cultural\u2026[and] occurring along three dimensions: spatial, temporal and cognitive\u201d (Lee, 2000, p. 30). Such broad descriptive definitions, while accurate, fail to take into account the fact that the primary influences of globalization on the social determinants of health are changes in patterns of international trade and investment, along with the underlying technological developments (Labonte & Torgerson, 2003). The economic manifestations of globalization, defined in this way, affect health by changing exposures to health risks, by changing the characteristics of health systems, and by affecting the structure of household, community and national economies (Zielinski Guti\u00e9rrez, & Kendall, 2000; Butler, Douglas, & McMichael, 2001; Woodward, Drager, Beaglehole, & Lipson, 2001; Labonte & Torgerson, 2003). Perhaps most dramatically, financial crises arising from the rapid flow of capital across national borders can plunge millions of people into poverty, while health and social service spending decreases (Hotchkiss & Jacobalis, 1999; Chavez & Cordero, 2001; O\u2019Brien, 2002; Kim et al., 2003). Over a longer time scale, technological and institutional change have resulted in the emergence of a genuinely global labour market, within which there are clear winners and losers (World Bank, 1995).",

These IDGs were published in 2000 as a joint effort of the UN, the OECD, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (2001), with the comment that: \u201cEach of the seven goals addresses an aspect of poverty. They should be viewed together because they are mutually reinforcing\u201d (International Monetary Fund, OECD, United Nations & World Bank Group, 2000, p. 4). A resolution (A/RES/55/2) of the UN General Assembly in 2000 incorporated several of the IDGs, as well as other objectives that are equally ambitious, and also directly related to health (Table 1\n), to generate a list that is now widely referred to as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Because the G7 countries, both individually (the MDGs) and collectively (the IDGs), have committed themselves to support a range of goals that are related to improving global health, it is appropriate to assess their Summit undertakings in light of that position.",

In addition, we limited our focus to the G7 countries, given Russia's newer membership and transitional situation. Early on, we confronted a fundamental choice. We could restrict our assessment of G7 performance to a few narrowly specific commitments, ideally involving dichotomous end points. Alternatively, we could err on the side of inclusiveness, starting from an inventory of statements many of which were not readily amenable to quantitative assessment of subsequent performance. We followed the latter course, for two reasons. First, the complexity of the determinants of health and the long period of time that sometimes elapses between policy change and health impact mean that it is necessary to assess patterns of policy commitment and implementation over time. Second, as we have noted, the fact that the G7 countries have lived up to the specific terms of a commitment made at the Summits says nothing about the adequacy of the response described in that commitment, or about its consistency with other policy objectives such as those embodied in the IDGs/MDGs.",

Oxfam (2001, Fig. 1) has calculated that in 14 HIPC countries, annual debt servicing costs will exceed combined public spending on health and primary education even after the maximum debt relief available under HIPC is obtained. This is because the value of debt relief available under HIPC is currently determined based on a ratio of debt service costs to anticipated future export revenues; a country's debt load is considered \u201csustainable\u201d if its net present value is less than 150 percent of annual export revenues. A more appropriate criterion for assessing sustainability would ensure that debt service costs did not compromise a country's ability to meet such objectives as the IDGs/MDGs (Greenhill, 2002; Greenhill & Sisti, 2003). Hanlon (2000), working backward from estimates of the expenditure that would be required to meet a list of targets similar to the MDGs, estimated that approximately US$600 billion (at current value) in debt cancellation would be necessary to ensure that debt repayment did not occur at the expense of essential social spending. This is an order of magnitude greater than the value of all debt relief to be provided under enhanced HIPC. Hanlon's estimates consider not only the HIPC countries, which he estimates will require debt relief worth $180 billion, but also many others. His calculations imply, for instance, debt relief of $24 billion for now-beleaguered Argentina (for which national poverty data are not even available), $116 billion for Indonesia, and $98 billion for India. A more cautious set of calculations, restricted to the HIPC countries, nevertheless reached the conclusion that meeting the MDGs in many countries would require not only complete cancellation of external debt but also substantial increases in revenues from ODA (Greenhill & Sisti, 2003).",

PRSPs were launched by the World Bank and IMF in December 1999, as \u201ca new approach to the challenge of reducing poverty in low-income countries based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies that would serve as a framework for development assistance\u201d (International Development Association/IMF, 2002, p. 5). Although PRSPs ostensibly place poverty reduction at the centre of their analysis, direct parallels exist between the process of qualifying for debt relief through the preparation of a PRSP and earlier forms of conditionality (Cheru, 2001; International Monetary Fund, 2001, pp. 50\u201352; UNCTAD, 2002a, p. 191). In order to understand the significance of these parallels, some historical background is needed. In 1980, the World Bank initiated structural adjustment loans to help heavily indebted poor countries cope with the impact of the 1979\u201380 recession on their ability to service external debt. Structural adjustment became far more important after 1982, when the government of Mexico announced that it was prepared to default on billions of dollars in loans, primarily made by major US banks. The result was the first of a series of \u201cdebt crises\u201d. Apprehensions about the stability of major banks in the industrialized world in the event of coordinated default led industrialized country governments, bilaterally and through the World Bank and the IMF, to provide new money for debt rescheduling.",

Among the consequences was reduced access to such services as health care and education as public expenditures were cut and user charges introduced (see e.g. Cheru, 1999; Cornia, Jolly & Stewart, eds.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2002b, p. 197) links the PRSP process with the inadequacy of overall levels of debt relief, noting that in order to ensure that a PRSP is perceived as \u201crealistic\u201d, countries like Uganda and Tanzania are still investing far less than the minimum amounts required for health and social programs. The World Health Organization goes further in analysing serious gaps in existing PRSPs with respect to health (WHO, 2002a). Among its major criticisms: PRSPs deal with ill health as a consequence of poverty, but do not reflect an understanding of its role as a cause of poverty, and thus are too willing to recommend cost recovery as a way of financing health care services for the poor. In addition, PRSPs do not deal with such important health system issues as expenditure levels well below the minimum needed to provide basic primary health care. As the next section of the article shows, this has been another neglected area in terms of G7 commitments.",

However, without major increases in the resources available for health care expenditure, it is unlikely that these targets can be met. Much the same is true for the health-related components of the IDGs and MDGs, even though major improvements in health could be achieved by way of relatively low-cost, low-technology interventions to prevent the spread of infectious disease and reduce the toll from diarrheal disease and childbirth (Spinaci & Heymann, 2001). The World Bank recently concluded, based on a scenario of 3.6 percent annual per capita income growth in the developing countries between 2005 and 2015 (which may well be optimistic) that South Asia was the only region likely to achieve the infant and child mortality reduction target specified in the IDGs (World Bank, 2002a, pp. 31\u201333).",

They described its creation as fulfilling a pledge from the preceding year \u201cto make a quantum leap in the fight against infectious diseases and to break the vicious cycle between disease and poverty\u201d (G8, 2001, \u00b6 15). Financial commitments from governments to date amount to $4.68 billion, with $1.6 billion paid to date and the balance payable at various dates as far away as 2008 (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/funds_raised/pledges/, accessed November 27, 2003). Since pledges do not all cover the same period, direct comparisons must be made with caution. However, the gap between the lowest per capita contribution among the G7 ($1.57, from Japan) and the highest ($10.80 from France) indicates varying levels of enthusiasm for the Fund's activities.3\nMore importantly, financial commitments made to date are far below the amounts recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2001), which argued that GFATM will require $8 billion per year by 2007, and $12 billion per year by 2015, in order to provide adequate support for prevention and treatment. To put these amounts into perspective, $8 billion is about as much as Americans spend per year on cosmetics or bathroom renovations, and about one-sixth as much as Europeans spend on cigarettes (Scott, 2002; UNDP, 1998, p. 37). It is easy to dismiss such comparisons as polemical, but they serve a critically important purpose in comparing the discretionary consumption of the global few with the low cost of health improvements for the many.",

            "text": "The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health estimates assume that developing countries have functioning health care systems. However, in many countries, the more immediate problem is how to avoid collapse of existing health infrastructure because of such factors as constraints on government expenditure, the impact of HIV/AIDS and the emigration of health professionals (see e.g. Sanders, Dovlo, Meeus, & Lehmann, 2003) . Although the G8 stated in 2001 that \u201c[s]trong national health systems will continue to play a key role in the delivery of effective prevention, treatment and care and in improving access to essential health services and commodities without discrimination\u201d ([24]G8, 2001, \u00b6 17), aid for all aspects of health system development accounts for just over 4 percent of total G7 ODA expenditure. To the extent that available data permit the calculation of trends, this proportion was stable or even declined during the 1990s (Table 4\n), albeit with wide variations between years and countries.4\nDeclining child vaccination coverage in all developing areas during the 1990s may illustrate the consequences. The decline in Africa is particularly troubling since almost 50 percent of African children are now not adequately vaccinated (Simms, Rowson, & Peattie, 2001; UNICEF, 2001, p. 89; WHO, 2002b). In addition, when governments lack the funds for minimally adequate health infrastructure, privatization of health services and the adoption of cost recovery measures tend to emerge as a superficially attractive, but highly inequitable alternative (Arhin-Tenkorang, 2000; Melgar, 1999; Schoepf, Schoepf, & Millen, 2000; Whitehead, Dahlgren, & Evans, 2001; Yong Kim, Shakow, Bayona, Rhatigan, & Rub\u00edn de Celis, 2000). The resulting \u201cmedical poverty trap\u201d (Whitehead, Dahlgren, & Evans, 2001) may actually undermine the potential for future economic growth.",

Part of the dispute is about whether the problem should be defined with reference to resource scarcity (with the corollary being that it can be \u201csolved\u201d by improving agricultural productivity through, e.g. the diffusion of genetically modified crops) or resource distribution. Amartya Sen (1981), Sen (1982), Sen (1989)'s path-breaking work on the political economy of famine showed that famines are not \u201cnatural\u201d phenomena, and that access to nutrition and food security are directly related either to purchasing power or to the availability of some other entitlement to food. This may explain the absence of specific G7 commitments on the topic. It could be argued that they are addressing the issues instead by way of economic development and poverty reduction, but the adequacy of their commitments in this area is itself open to question. So, too\u2014as we note later in the article\u2014is the appropriateness of the underlying presumptions about economic development.",

And how much longer may the poor be asked to wait for improvements in access to health care and in the basic determinants of health? The question is not just a rhetorical one, because contemporary development policy appears implicitly to accept a trade-off of short-term health deterioration for the prospect of eventual improvement. That acceptance was made explicit by a team of World Bank researchers studying dramatic declines in health status in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union: \u201cIn the long run, the transition towards a market economy and adoption of democratic forms of government should ultimately lead to improvements in health status\u2026.

In Agenda 21, the document that emerged from the Earth Summit, developed countries as a whole \u201creaffirm[ed] their commitments to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 percent of GDP for ODA\u201d, first proposed in 1969, and \u201cto augment their aid programmes in order to reach that target as soon as possible\u201d (United Nations, 1992, p. 33). In 1999, the G7 committed themselves gradually to increase the volume of ODA, and to put special emphasis on countries best positioned to use it effectively (G8, 1999, \u00b6 27). At the 2000 and 2001 Summits, emphasis shifted instead to the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of ODA (G8, 2000, \u00b6 20; G8, 2001, \u00b6 14). Today, none of the G7 countries approaches the 0.7 percent target and, in contrast to the performance of some industrialized countries outside the G7, the trend has been one of declining G7 commitments to ODA over the past 15 years (Table 5\n), during the very period of growth that has produced, for those countries, unprecedented prosperity. Table 5 shows that some other industrialized countries have met and exceeded the target, so it is not inherently implausible. Table 6\nbreaks down the costs for each G7 country of moving to the 0.7 percent figure, in terms of one of the most familiar international commodities: the Big Mac.",

Agricultural subsidies in the industrialized world, which simultaneously limit developing countries\u2019 market access and offer domestic producers an incentive to generate surpluses that are dumped on international markets, represent an especially intractable problem. It is difficult to disagree with economist Ha-Joon Chang (2002) description of the growth strategy now being urged on the developing world by the G7, the World Bank and the IMF as \u201ckicking the ladder away\u201d: the strategy is one that no G7 country followed on its own path to industrialization and wealth creation\u2014with the partial exception of England after the repeal of the Corn Laws, which had the advantage of empire as a captive market as well as a source of raw materials.

A more expansive economic argument is exemplified by the work of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, for which \u201cinvestment in health\u201d represented an investment in future development, because it can initiate virtuous cycles of human capital formation and growth. The approach is empirically well grounded, yet without further elaboration it invites a form of triage in which the countries, regions and populations that receive investments in health will primarily be those where \u201cdevelopment\u201d offers the greatest promise of economic returns, e.g. because of the availability of expanding consumer markets or the availability of healthy and relatively skilled, yet low-cost labour.",
