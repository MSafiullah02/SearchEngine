Ecosystems support human health and well-being through their provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services (Butler and others 2003). Shortages of food, fiber, and other ecosystem products adversely affect human health via many direct and indirect pathways. The regulating functions of ecosystems that affect health include the purification of air and fresh water, the reduction of flooding and drought, and range limitation of certain vector-borne diseases. Ecosystems also impact mental well-being through provision of cultural services, for example by providing totemic species and sacred groves, landscapes, and water bodies. These influence the aesthetic, recreational, educational, cultural, and spiritual aspects of the human experience. Ecosystem changes have also altered the epidemiology of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, including through some pathways that would not be considered as arising from a reduced ecosystem regulating service.",

The reasons for these increases are well-known and include the mutually reinforcing and interacting elements of improved knowledge, technology, and social organization, including of public health (Horiuchi 2000; Szreter 1999). A fundamental contributory factor has been the increased human capacity to modify ecosystems, for example, by increasing food supplies, by restricting populations of large carnivores, and by providing more fiber for fuel and shelter.",

National life expectancy has fallen in several countries, including many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Haiti, Russia, North Korea, and Ethiopia (Farmer and others 2003; Shkolnikov and others 2001; United Nations Population Divisional 1999). Reduced ecosystem services may explain a part of these declines in national life expectancy and thus may be an underrecognized factor in the slowed rate of increase in global life expectancy. The problems of decreased provision of ecosystem services are often unequally distributed, with the majority of the burden falling on the poor. Additionally, poor populations frequently lack the income and other means to substitute or partly compensate for reduced ecosystem services (for example, by boiling microbiologically contaminated water).",

The fish catch has decreased due to a climate-related reduction in the nutrient supply (O\u2019Reilly and others 2003). This reduction in ecosystem services places additional economic and nutritional stresses on an already poor and vulnerable human population. Although data to measure the health effect of this reduced catch are unlikely to be available, the effect is probably adverse because it causes reduced income and reduced nutrition (Verschuren 2003). Another example is the collapse of cod fishing in the North Atlantic, which caused widespread unemployment, mental distress, and social dislocation, but little if any true under nutrition because the social mechanisms operating in Canada were able to partially substitute for the lost provisioning services once supplied by the fishery. A third example of a direct health effect from a reduced ecosystem service is the disruption and physical injury caused by flooding. There is increasing recognition that floods are caused by the interaction of climatic and land-use changes (Hellin and others, 1999; Zhang and others, 2000). There is also increasing evidence that mental and physical health is enhanced by contact with nature (Friedman and Thomas 1995). Reduction of the cultural services that ecosystems provide is likely to contribute to the already enormous burden of disease caused by impaired mental health.",

Both long-distance dust transport and more localized air pollution are also related to ecosystem service change and have been linked with a number of diseases, including asthma and atopy (Monteil 2002). There is also increasing evidence that air pollution, often exacerbated by ecosystem change such as land clearing and fires, may aggravate heart disease (Pyne 2002). Future ecosystem change, such as desertification, leading to a decrease in the ecosystem provisioning service of clean air, could thus alter the epidemiology of these diseases.",

The ecological factors that underlie the recent SARS outbreak remain unclear (Enserink and Normile 2003), but its origin and amplification in a region of China, characterized by extremely dense populations of humans and domesticated animals and by poor public health services (Anonymous 2003), is consistent with the view that human-dominated ecosystems today harbor more danger to population health than does the \u201cwild\u201d (Oxford and others 2002). A plausible example of this principle could be the widespread transmission of multi-or even omni drug-resistant tuberculosis emerging from a prison (Tanne 1999; Dye and others, 2002). This scenario would have severe economic implications, especially for aviation and other industries perceived as increasing the probability of disease spread.",

Two more recent examples are the Irish famine of the 1840s and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The Irish famine was caused by the spread of a potato fungus (Wilson 1995) interacting with a refusal by the British government to supply an effective substitute, such as famine relief (Sen 2000, pp 170\u20135). The Rwandan genocide also occurred as a result of the interaction of multiple factors, including poor governance, long-standing ethnic hatred, and rapid population growth. The violence was inflicted mainly by a large number of unemployed young men (Mesquida and Weiner 1996; Potts 1999), displaced from a livelihood in farming because of the shortage of fertile arable land, thus losing a key ecosystem service (Andr\u00e9 and Platteau 1998; Butler-2000a).",

For example, Rotberg (2002) identifies the roots of state failure as based in ethnic, religious, linguistic, or other intercommunal enmity. He argues that state failure is \u201cman-made, not merely accidental nor\u2014fundamentally\u2014caused geographically, environmentally, or externally.\u201d We do not claim that reduced ecosystem services or other ecosystem changes that lead to adverse health effects are always a \u201cfundamental\u201d factor in state failure, but they are often important and usually identifiable. The enmity that Rotberg refers to often arises over the distribution of diminishing per capita ecosystem services. There may be increasing recognition of this. For example, O\u2019Reilly and others (2003) concludes, in discussing the potential for further reduction in the ecosystem provisioning service of Lake Tanganyika, that \u201cthe human implications of such subtle, but progressive, environmental changes are potentially dire in this densely populated region of the world, where large lakes are essential natural resources for regional economies.\u201d",

The names of the four scenarios considered in this article are market forces, reformed market, value change, and higher fences (see Table 2). It is difficult to succinctly describe these scenarios, but a number of axes can be identified along which they vary. For example, there is a spectrum identifiable between comparative economic deregulation (market forces) to a neo-Keynesian model, here called reformed market. Another spectrum can be identified between a concerted attempt to protect existing ecosystem services (the \u201cvalue change\u201d scenario) and a laissez faire approach to ecosystems and the nonliving environment, such as climate change (the \u201cmarket forces\u201d scenario). A third spectrum is identifiable between trade deregulation (\u201creformed market\u201d) and continuing or even increased protectionism (\u201chigher fences\u201d). As well, the trend of global income distribution can be predicted from these scenarios, from a continuing increase (\u201chigher fences\u201d) to a marked decrease (\u201creformed market\u201d and \u201cvalue change\u201d).\n",

The health gaps between high- and low-income populations have been systematically estimated using a measure called \u201cdisability adjusted life years\u201d which accounts for total years of life lost because of disease and also for partial years of life lost because of disability (World Health Report 2002).",

We suggest that it is meaningful to assume that human populations are characterized by social resilience, which modifies their capacity to effectively deal with stress (Carpenter and others 2001). From a public health perspective, resilience may be defined as the capacity of society to respond to problems and challenges, over the short and long term, in ways that protect and advance public health, over the short and long term. Affluence, education, social cooperation, technological capability, and flexibility are important determinants of the size of social buffers and human resilience. We suggest that systems failure effects are more likely to occur in the market-forces and higher-fences scenarios, because inequality between high- and low-income populations is likely to be the greatest in these scenarios.\n",
