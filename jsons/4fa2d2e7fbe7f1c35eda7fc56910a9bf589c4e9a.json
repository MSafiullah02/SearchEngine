To form extracellular traps, granulocytes release a scaffold consisting of mitochondrial DNA in association with granule proteins. As we understand more about the molecular mechanism for the formation of extracellular DNA traps, the in vivo function of this phenomenon under pathological conditions remains an enigma. In this article, we critically review the literature to summarize the evidence for extracellular DNA trap formation under in vivo conditions. Extracellular DNA traps have not only been detected in infectious diseases but also in chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as in cancer. While on the one hand, extracellular DNA traps clearly exhibit an important function in host defense, it appears that they can also contribute to the maintenance of inflammation and metastasis, suggesting that they may represent an interesting drug target for such pathological conditions.",

Studies aiming at unraveling the underlying mechanisms of NET formation demonstrated a requirement for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2] [3] [4] [5] . ROS induces actin and tubulin glutathionylation, which is tightly regulated by glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), an enzyme required for deglutathionylation of actin and microtubulin. Thus, an intact cytoskeleton is required for the formation of NETs 6 . Moreover, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), one of five GTPase dynamin family members, known to play a role in mitochondrial (mt) fusion, has recently been shown to be required for ATP production through glycolysis in neutrophils. If increases in ATP production are blocked, the assembly of the microtubule network and thus the formation of NETs do not occur 7 . ATP and ATP channel pannexin 1 (Panx1) contribute to NET formation and may represent therapeutic targets 8 .",

Over the last decade, a number of stimuli, microbial and noninfectious stimuli, able to induce extracellular trap formation have been identified [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . It should be noted that there is an ongoing scientific dispute whether NET formation requires cell death or not [17] [18] [19] [20] . In this article, we focus on the current evidence of DNA traps under in vivo conditions and discuss their possible role(s) in the disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that extracellular DNA traps exert effects beyond host defense, including allergic diseases, cancer, vascular diseases, and coagulation. This assumption is best supported by the observation that besides granulocytes, activated T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes are also able to release mtDNA forming extracellular web-like structures, but the latter are devoid of bactericidal proteins. However, these structures containing mtDNA are able to provoke a rapid type I interferon (IFN-I) production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that lymphocytes and monocytes use mtDNA as a rapid signaling molecule to communicate danger 21 . Interestingly, mtDNA being enriched in unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide motifs similar to bacterial and viral DNA could provoke IL-10 secretion 21, 22 , and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) release 23 . IL-10 is known to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine 24 , and TGF-\u03b2 mediates the suppression of macrophage-directed inflammation, reducing TNF-\u03b1 release 25 . Combination of antiinflammatory and regulatory cytokines could dampen the excess inflammation (Fig. 1a) .",

For example, increased DNA concentrations can occur as a consequence of a lytic granulocyte death (Fig. 1b) , but also as a result of tissue damage that is a frequent phenomenon with inflammatory responses. Moreover, in contrast to in vitro conditions, the exact type of stimulus, its dosage and exposure time cannot be assessed under in vivo condition.

Neutrophils abundantly released NETs, and the NET length that was highest during acute infection and shortened with the recovery, correlated with clinical and laboratory signs of infection, as well as inflammatory cytokine levels in serum 28 . In an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which neutrophil infiltration promotes tissue injury and sustained inflammation, the content of cf DNA in bronchoalveolar fluid was significantly higher in mice injected with LPS from Escherichia coli as compared with controls, and was decreased by glutamine treatment 29 . It should be noted, however, that in these two studies, NET formation and DNA concentrations were analyzed ex vivo using BAL fluids. To compensate for this shortcoming, lung tissue biopsies should be stained for NET detection in order to confirm the ex vivo data. In addition, cf DNA as well as granule and histone proteins are often quantified as \"in vivo NET formation\" 30 . Clearly, it is impossible to distinguish whether the released DNA/ protein complexes are owing to NET formation or neutrophil death 31, 32 , the latter of which was reported to occur under in vivo conditions more than 50 years ago 33, 34 .",

For instance, the role of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), an enzyme that catalyzes citrullination of histones, has been intensively studied in association with NET formation. Several reports have argued that PAD4 activity is essential for NET formation 14, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , and contrary others disputed that PAD4 is not crucial for NET formation or the antimicrobial defense mechanism in vivo [42] [43] [44] [45] . Specifically, NET formation in Klebsiella pneumonia-induced pneumonia was investigated showing NET-like structures surrounding Klebsiella bacteria at sites of immune infiltration in both Pad4 \u2212/\u2212 and Pad4 +/+ mice. Moreover, both groups showed similar bacterial growth, lung inflammation, and organ injury. In conclusion, these data argue against a major role for PAD4 in NET formation, host defense, or organ injury during pneumonia-derived sepsis 44 .",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the airways associated with bacterial colonization. It has been reported that CF neutrophils have a pro-survival phenotype that allows increased NET production, which can in turn induce inflammation 46 . However, it should be noted that this conclusion is based mainly on ex vivo data. Both mucoid and non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were demonstrated to activate neutrophils to generate NETs, a process that is promoted by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 47 . Moreover, MIF protein levels in the blood of CF patients were significantly elevated compared with MIF levels in pooled human serum from healthy controls and negatively correlated with lung function 47 . On the other hand, the development of mucoidy (i.e., increased alginate production) is an acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factor that is closely associated with increased severity of CF. The conversion to a mucoid phenotype coincided with a decline in susceptibility to NETs, raising the possibility that increased alginate production decreases interactions with NETs, or otherwise interferes with killing by NET-associated granule proteins 48 . Fig. 1 Modulation of the immune system by neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and cytolysis. a NET formation: In response to physiological stimuli or bacterial infection, viable neutrophils generate NETs in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NETs consist of a mitochondrial (mt)DNA scaffold, which binds neutrophil granule proteins such as neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) 4, 6, 7, 144, 152 . If the source of infection/stimulation persists, the released mtDNA, having similarity to viral and bacterial DNA (enriched in unmethylated CpG motifs), acts as a danger signal and triggers cytokine production for a protective and regulated immune response 7, 55 . b Cytolysis: Under pathological conditions, such as the persistent presence of foreign antigens 104 , \"too large to be trapped antigens\", such as fungal hyphae 60, 61 , strong adhesion receptor activation [153] [154] [155] , presence of monosodium urate (MSU) 88 , or phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) stimulation 2,12 , results in an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neutrophil cytolysis. Similarly, excessive increases in intracellular calcium [Ca 2+ ] i by ionomycin results in non-apoptotic neutrophil death 12, 81 . Certain bacteria are also capable of causing neutrophil cytolysis by releasing pore-forming toxins that can directly cause plasma cell and nuclear membrane permeabilization [156] [157] [158] [159] . The externalized cell exudates containing cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins together with damaged nuclear DNA can act as so-called self-antigens (Self-Ag) that are recognized and processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Activated APCs produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulate autoreactive T and B cells, leading to autoantibody production. The circulating autoantibodies such as anti-damaged-DNA/RNA ribonucleoprotein antibody immune complexes (RNP-ICs-Ab) can further activate neutrophils, including NET formation (not shown) 13, 73, 74 , leading to vicious cycle of chronic inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals 68, 74 , causing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE).",

As neutrophil elastase (NE), a component of NETs, was demonstrated to be enzymatically active and NE staining observed in areas adjacent to focal necrosis, the authors concluded that NET formation largely contributes to liver damage 14 .

By applying immunofluorescence staining, NETs composed of mtDNA and MPO have been detected in affected glomeruli 66 . Moreover, the proportion of glomeruli infiltrated by netting neutrophils correlates with lupus nephritis activity. The fact that NETs containing MPO as well as intact neutrophils are present in the dermis and dermal blood vessels of cutaneous lupus lesions suggests that enhanced NET formation occurs in vivo in affected organs of SLE patients 76 . SLE patients were found to develop autoantibodies to both the self-DNA and antimicrobial peptides present in NETs, indicating that these complexes serve as autoantigens to trigger B-cell activation. NETs containing cathelicidin LL-37-DNA complexes can directly trigger human memory B cells and induce the production of anti-neutrophil and anti-LL-37 antibodies in B cells of SLE patients (Fig. 1) 77 .",

On the other hand, NETs with their components mtDNA, PR3, and MPO have been shown to be taken up by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), significantly inducing the production of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in mice immunized with NET-loaded mDC 83 . Therefore, both NET-induced autoimmunity as well as autoantibody-mediated NET formation seem to represent a vicious circle in disease pathogenesis. Similarly, druginduced formation of NETs enriched in NE serving as auto-antigen, together with the release of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) resulting in B-cell activation, and the production of ANCA directed against NE that further enhance NET formation, have been assumed to be pathogenic mechanisms in cocaine and levamisoleassociated autoimmunity 84 .

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been identified as a cytokine-stimulating eosinophils to form EETs, an observation that might be relevant for BP since TSLP is expressed in the epidermis and eosinophils infiltrating BP lesions express the TSLP receptor 10 . In an ex vivo skin model, eosinophils stimulated with IL-5 in the presence of BP serum caused a dermal-epidermal splitting resembling BP. This splitting was significantly decreased upon adding DNase I, suggesting that EET formation plays at least a partial role 90 . These observations make eosinophils interesting targets for therapy 91 . A recent study reported the presence of NETs at sites of blister formation in BP that decreased with time following treatment in patients undergoing remission 92 .",

A subgroup of patients expressed a high level of neutrophils and NETs, in which the extracellular mtDNA was associated with NE 97 . In an animal model of asthma, the treatment with deoxyribonuclease, which cleaves extracellular DNA, resulted in an improvement of airway resistance and abolished extracellular DNA content in BALF as well as goblet cell hyperplasia 98 . Peripheral blood eosinophils from patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) may be more activated to produce EETs than those from patients with nonsevere asthma (NSA), which further induces inflammation in asthmatic airways 99 . Surfactant protein-D (SP-D), an epithelial cell product of the airways, is a critical immune regulatory molecule with a multimeric structure susceptible to oxidative modifications. We have demonstrated that SP-D directly binds to the eosinophil membrane, inhibits EET formation, and reduces asthma exacerbations 100 . NETs have also been visualized in induced sputum from patients with asthma and COPD, which compared with control sputum, exhibited higher levels of extracellular DNA and other NET components, such as cathelicidin LL-37, alphadefensin 1-3, NE, IL-1\u03b2, and CXCL8 correlating with decreased lung function 101 .

In a subsequent study, it was demonstrated that EETs, but not NETs, were detected at various degrees in all tissue specimens of nasal polyps or ethmoid tissues obtained by endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Moreover, a high plasma nucleosome level was identified as an independent risk factor for severe coronary stenosis, and the level of MPO-DNA complexes predicted the number of atherosclerotic vessels 116 . In patients with stable coronary artery disease who had high dsDNA plasma levels, the risk of experiencing a clinical endpoint defined as unstable angina, non-hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death was significantly increased after 2 years 117 .

For initiating arterial thrombosis in injured vessels, the interaction of neutrophils with endothelial cells is a critical step preceding platelet accumulation 119 . Activated lesional smooth muscle cells (SMCs) may attract neutrophils that undergo neutrophil death (not NET formation), releasing nuclear proteins, including histone H4, which induce lytic cell death of smooth muscle cells causing the destabilization of plaques. Neutralization of histone H4 led to a plaque stabilization, whereas blocking histone H2A or disrupting DNA structures by DNase had no effect on smooth muscle cells 120 . A significant decrease in infarction size and reduction of citrullinated histone 3 in infarcted tissue were demonstrated upon blocking of CCL5 and CXCL4 in mice, what was believed to be due to a reduced neutrophil recruitment 121 . In a model of myocardial infarction, Pad4 \u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly protected from, whereas mice without PAD4 deficiency had myocardial injury with the presence of citrullinated histone H3 at the site of injury and increased plasma levels for nucleosomes 122 . Our interpretation of these findings is that a lytic neutrophil death might be prevented in the absence of PAD4. Therefore, a lytic neutrophil death and not of NET formation seems to be important for atherothrombosis.",

            "text": "In several mouse models, NET formation has been demonstrated to be associated with tumor growth and/or metastasis (Fig. 4) , e.g., NETs have been reported to enhance the growth of melanoma 139 , gastric cancer 140 , and hepatocellular cancer 141 . Moreover, cancer cells themselves are able to stimulate neutrophils to form NETs that facilitate cancer cell migration and invasion as shown in vitro and in vivo, indicating that they make use of a physiological host defense mechanism process to promote metastasis (Fig. 4) 142 . Mechanisms by which cancer cells may stimulate neutrophils to form NETs are the production of IL-8 and the release of exosomes requiring additional priming with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Fig. 4) 142, 143 . More recently, it was reported that anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells induce the release of mitochondrial extracellular DNA traps by viable neutrophils. ATC conditioned medium (CM)-primed neutrophils promoted ATC cell proliferation in a NET-dependent manner 144 . Furthermore, tumor cells have been demonstrated to produce IL-8, attracting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and activating granulocytic MDSC to extrude DNA nets 145 . In addition, by applying intravital microscopy, a significant increase in the in vivo hepatic adhesion of intrasplenically injected lung or colon cancer cells was observed in the presence of NETs when compared with animals, in which NET formation had been prevented 146 . Although tumorinfiltrating neutrophils were rare in tissue specimens of epithelial ovarian cancer, both intact neutrophils and NETs were observed in tumors from 4 of 5 patients 147 . Moreover, in ascites supernatants of patients with advanced tumors, high mtDNA, and NE levels were found that correlated with reduced progression-free survival 148 .",

Similarly, surgical stress employing liver ischemia reperfusion resulted in an increase in NET formation with subsequent development and progression of metastatic disease, while pretreatment of mice with topical DNase application or a PAD4 inhibitor abrogated these effects 150 . Consistent with the observation in mice, increased postoperative NET formation inversely correlated with disease-free survival times in a cohort of patients undergoing attempted curative liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer 150 . It should be noted, however, these authors measured serum levels of MPO-DNA complexes and did not directly analyze NET formation. Therefore, it could very well be that metastasis was associated with neutrophil cell death and not with NET formation.",

On the other hand, they might be able to trigger additional immune responses. Based on recently published work, extracellular microbial killing and phagocytosis act in synergy to effectively remove intracellular and extracellular pathogens regardless of their sizes. A simple biomarker that reflects NET and/or EET formation is currently not available. However, extracellular DNA traps can be detected in inflamed tissues using fluorescence/ immunofluorescence techniques. The mechanism of Interactions between tumor cells and neutrophils determines the outcome of tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Soluble factors and inflammatory mediators such as IL-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), as well as microparticles released from tumor cells prime and activate neutrophils to form NETs. NETsassociated granule proteins can contribute to tumor metastasis by releasing proteases such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and neutrophil elastase (NE) that allows tumor cells to move out of the primary niche and to migrate to other organs 143,151,160 . extracellular DNA trap formation remains highly controversial that includes questions regarding the requirement of cell death, the source of DNA, as well as intracellular signaling pathways.",
