The pilgrims perform their first circumambulations by walking seven times anticlockwise around the Kaaba. Then, they are required to walk for a total distance of \u223c2.1 km between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times. On the 13 October, they travel to Mina and spend one night there for prayers and additional rituals. The next day, the pilgrims around the world gather at Arafat. When the sun sets, they leave Arafat and move to Muzdalifah, located between Arafat and Mina. They stay at Mina in crowded tents for at least two nights. For the completion of the umrah pilgrimage, which is called the lesser pilgrimage; it is different as it can be performed throughout the year, the pilgrims are not required to perform the brief stay at Arafat.",

The respiratory problems account for 74% of all medical illnesses reported during hajj seasons.4 Pneumonia being the leading reason for hospital admission in 39% of all patients.5 A recent study involving Malaysian hajj pilgrims found that 90% of them had at least one respiratory symptom.6 Respiratory illness is a disease affecting the respiratory system and can be due to infection or non-infection. It is complex to define the syndromes of respiratory illness due to variation in the severity, duration and types of symptoms.7",

They were at a significantly high risk of developing the respiratory illness by three times higher than those who do not have the contact (P value 0.01). Practising contact avoidance during hajj is imperative as it can shorten the duration of respiratory illness.18 Practicing social distancing and contact avoidance is effective in reducing the transmission of the respiratory symptoms during the 2009 US pilgrims and ILI symptoms in 2014 with the Indian pilgrims.18,19 The majority of the respondents was inflicted with respiratory illness after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). It may be correlated with the incubation period of the illness and the peak exposure of pilgrims whilst performing the hajj rituals. Other studies estimated approximately one in three pilgrims will experience respiratory symptoms which usually occurred at the end or shortly after performing hajj rituals.20",

The association of previous experiences during hajj or umrah with respiratory illness has not been studied before. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj or umrah were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of developing respiratory illness (P value of 0.001 for both). Further study needs to be conducted to explore the factors that contribute to the association of respiratory illness in those who have experienced performing hajj or umrah.",
