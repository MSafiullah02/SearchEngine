Respiratory symptoms started 10 days before admission. She received hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, the latter shortly due to gastric intolerance, being discharged 9 days after admission, with two negative swab SARS-CoV-2 tests. Five days after her discharge, she came to our hospital complaining of progressive gait impairment. The interval between first signs of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and the neurological symptoms was about 12\u201315 days.",

Faced with suspicion of neurological pathology related to SARS-CoV-2 prior infection, cranial MRI was performed which showed non-pathological alterations. An electromyography showing slight F-wave delay in upper limbs was done. Ordinary laboratory results showed normality in blood white cell account. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an increased protein level (110 mg/dl, normal 15\u201345 mg/dl) with less than 5 white cells, 100% lymphocytes. With Guillain\u2013 Barr\u00e9 syndrome-like suspicion, she was admitted for intravenous immunoglobulins treatment. She also complained about blurred vision, being assessed by ophthalmology without noticeable alterations, and performing visual-evoked potentials, without findings. She received 20 g of immunoglobulins daily, during 5 days. Antiganglioside antibodies, including anti GD1b, were negative. CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR was also negative. The day 6, she was discharged. A new neurological exploration was done the 12th day after her first visit to clinics. An improvement in gait was observed, and also, lower limb reflexes were slightly present. A new EMG was done, but it remained unchanged.",

Also, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome related to others coronavirus has been reported [3]. Instead of a proper Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, we considered our patient a Miller\u2013Fisher-like syndrome, due to her marked ataxia and lower limbs areflexia, probably an acute ataxic neuropathy. Even though no ophthalmoparesis was observed, we consider that the neurological symptoms overlapped with the respiratory symptoms; so, maybe they were unattended in her prior admission. The interval of 12\u201315 days between time of first respiratory symptoms and time of neurological symptoms onset is similar to other Miller\u2013Fisher and other Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndromes associated with other viral infections [4].",

Though we have done 2 EMG separated in time, we could not demonstrate peripheral demyelination nor axonal damage. Also, we did not find GD1-b antibodies. But the response to immunoglobulins was typical as it is observed in other Miller\u2013Fisher syndromes. Future reports should clarify this observational relationship.",
