Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety-and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.",

Studies of past respiratory viral pandemics suggest that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms can arise in the context of acute viral infection, or after variable periods of time post-infection. Reports from the 18 th and 19 th centuries suggest that influenza pandemics in particular have been marked by increased incidences of various neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 4 mania, psychosis, suicidality, and delirium (Honigsbaum, 2013; Menninger, 1926) . For instance, encephalitis lethargica (EL) is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS marked by hypersomnolence, psychosis, catatonia, and Parkinsonism, the incidence of which increased around the time of the \"Spanish\" influenza pandemic of the early 20 th century (Von Economo, 1932) . During the more recent 2009 influenza (H1N1) pandemic and other coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012), several neuropsychiatric sequelae were reported, including narcolepsy, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (Kim et al., 2017; Manjunatha et al., 2011; Tsai et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2014) .",

However, beyond acute infection, the delayed or chronic effects of this pandemic, particularly on public mental health, will not be fully appreciated for several years. Thus, timely and longitudinal investigations of potential COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric outcomes are critical in disease surveillance and evidencebased therapeutic strategies. Here we review the available studies of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the context of COVID-19 for timely evaluation of the evidence. Furthermore, we postulate possible delayed post-viral sequelae of COVID-19 based on findings from other coronavirus or past viral pandemics. Lastly, potential mechanisms by which neuropsychiatric symptoms could develop, especially, in the context of immune reactions to viral illness are discussed, as are future directions.",

It is unknown if reduced lymphocytes in circulation reflect margination or target tissue migration, although probable. Plasma granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels were significantly higher in CoV-CNS patients , which may drive the expansion of CNS-invading phagocytes (e.g., inflammatory monocyte-derived cells; MdC such as dendritic cells) (Zhao et al., 2017) .

These post-CoV complications were described in small case series, and causality therefore, cannot be definitively established. Separately, murine CoVs are neuroinvasive and precipitate demyelination (Lane and Hosking, 2010) . In humans, postmortem analysis of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls indicated that HCoV RNA was present in 48% of all donors, with a greater incidence of OC43, but not 229E strain, in MS patients (Arbour et al., 2000) . These findings suggest that although HCoV infiltration into the CNS is prevalent, its association with demyelinating disorders such as MS may be strain-specific.

            "text": "One challenge to elucidating the mechanisms of COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications is that SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis, or CNS inflammation as evidenced by fever, focal neurologic signs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, neuroimaging, and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, may be difficult to distinguish from encephalopathy arising from systemic (but not CNS) infection. At present, only one study to our knowledge has identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF of a COVID-19 patient with acute neurologic symptoms, including seizures (Moriguchi et al., 2020) , although case reports of CoV detection in CSF among patients during the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic do exist (Lau et al., 2004) . Two recent case reports of severe COVID-19 indicate meningitic and/or encephalitic pathology in the absence of viral RNA detection in CSF, Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 11 which the authors suggest could be associated with transient or low viral load in the CNS, or due to lack of availability of testing (Duong et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020) . Notably, the key receptor that SARS-CoV hijacks for host intracellular invasion (ACE2) is expressed in both neurons and glia, and experimental studies of intranasally-inoculated SARS-CoV-1 infection in ACE2 transgenic mice demonstrated neuronal death and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, IL-6) by neurons and astrocytes (Netland et al., 2008) . Even in the absence of CoV-2 infiltration into the CNS, peripheral cytokines involved in the host antiviral response (see Section 2.1) may elicit neuropsychiatric symptoms by precipitating neuroinflammatory responses and/or compromised blood-brain-interface (BBI) integrity, leading to peripheral immune cell transmigration into the CNS, and disruption of neurotransmission (Dantzer, 2018) .",

There is also evidence suggesting that leukocytes can remain persistently infected by CoV (Arbour et al., 2000; Desforges et al., 2007) .

Viral infections may precede development of autoimmunity in vulnerable individuals. The underlying mechanisms may include viral infection creating an inflammatory milieu which favors aberrant immune responses and promoting expansion of host antibodies or lymphocytes, which are cross-reactive both with viral antigen and self-antigen (i.e. \"molecular mimicry\") (Fairweather et al., 2005; Rose, 2017) . In animal models of MS, auto-reactive lymphocytes have been identified which cross-react with both CoV epitopes and human myelin (Desforges et al., 2019) , suggesting that molecular mimicry might be a potential mechanism by which CoV infection could potentiate development of autoimmune neuropsychiatric sequelae.",

However, retrospective studies suggest corticosteroids are not uncommonly used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients Mo et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020) . Similarly, high doses of corticosteroids were administered to treat SARS CoV-1 infection symptoms during the acute phase (Lee et al., 2003) , but were associated with organic hallucinations and manic symptoms, which were treated with haloperidol (Cheng et al., 2004) . There is ample evidence of adverse neuropsychiatric effects following corticosteroid therapy, impacting about 35% of treated patients, including cognitive and sleep disturbances, delirium, hypomania, mania, depression, and psychosis (Brown and Chandler, 2001; Warrington and Bostwick, 2006) . The neuropsychiatric effects of corticosteroid treatments Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 13 are typically acute and resolve upon termination of treatment, suggesting that steroid-mediated neuropsychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 cases will likely be acute, but necessitate close monitoring and intervention as needed, nonetheless. Further, other immunomodulatory treatments have been proposed for treating severe COVID-19, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), cytokine blocking medications, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (Mehta et al., 2020) . However, the degree to which these agents have been used clinically, and the neuropsychiatric outcomes in infected individuals who have been exposed versus not exposed to such treatments, are unknown, highlighting the need for further investigation going forward.",
