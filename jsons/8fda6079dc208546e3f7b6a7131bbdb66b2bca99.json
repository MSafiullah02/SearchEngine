In every mathematics and physics classroom, instructors are using the time series of the number of cases to show exponential growth of the infection. In this manuscript we propose a simple diffusion process as the mode of spreading infections. This model is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate and predict the total number of cases as a function of time. Students are also given the opportunity to add other factors that are not considered in the simple diffusion model.",

The disease started in the Hubei province in China in December 2019 and by early January 2020 started to spread. It grew very rapidly, triggering responses from the Chinese and other governments. On March 11, 2020 the World Health organization declared that COVID-19 was then characterized as a pandemic. 1 The situation triggered different responses from different governments. In The United States, many colleges took the initiative to start their own social distance programs, including sending all students back home, extending spring breaks, and ultimately moving all classes to distance learning. 2,3 Many cities and states followed up with shelter at home mandates. 4 The situation in many countries became alarming due to the exponential growth of new cases and deaths. 5,6",

The first step in modeling the data is just to plot the number of cases as a function of time and show that it exhibits an exponential growth. For beginners it is important to introduce them to the logarithmic scale, where the plot becomes a straight line and students can extract the exponent and realize that the fit to the US data on March 20, 2020 shows that the number of cases doubles every 2.4 days. Fits to the data for Chicago and New York City show that these cities are having similar growth rates as seen in FIG. 1, however the total number of cases in Chicago is smaller. One can speculate that this might be due to difference in population densities in these cities.",

The benefits of this project is that its implementation is simple, but it can lead to a qualitative understanding on how diseases are spread and it can also allow the student to understand factors that can affect it. The main ingredients of the model are: individuals are considered particles that obey a Brownian diffusion process; each individual will have three possible states, healthy, sick (contagious), and cured; a healthy individual has a probability of getting infected if its distance to a sick individual is smaller than a certain threshold; the incubation and sickness periods are the same; once an individual gets cured, it cannot be infected or contagious again.",

With this hypothesis alone, students should be able to generate a enough data for the project. They can also discuss if the mobility (diffusion constant) should be the same in both cases and study the effect of mobility in the spread of the disease. In the proposed model the period of incubation is the same as the period of sickness, students can be offered the option to modify this assumption. The model also assumes that once cured, an individual cannot get sick again, and will not be able to spread the disease. They can discuss modifications to the model to incorporate relapse.

The initial diffusion constant was chose at D = 100m 2 /day with a time step dt = 0.01day. Therefore the variance of the gaussian distribution is 1. In this case the number of simulation steps is 9000 for each individual simulation is 27s in a laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz. Therefore 50 simulations will take about 22.5 minutes of computation. We assume that the radius of contamination is 2m, and that the probability of contamination is 10% for each time step (14.4 min) that a healthy individual is within the radius of contamination of a sick individual. The incubation period is taken as 14 days. Below are some of the results of these simulations.InFIG. 2we present the results of the simulation for New York City with the set of parameters in the previous paragraph. As one can see, under this assumption 64% of the population is sick on day 21 and 99% of the population will be infected after 50 days. One can see that after day 26 the number of sick people starts to decline. However, if the death rate is similar to what has been observed on the COVID-19 pandemic, about 6% of the population of NYC would perish, and the numbers would be even worse, since no major city in the world would be able to have hospital beds for 64% of its population. In the figure we also observe that the rate of cure is follows the number of infected individuals with a lag time of 14 days, which is the incubation/sickness period.InFIG. 3we reduce the diffusion constant to D = 50m 2 /day and keep all other variables the same. One can see that under these conditions, and starting with 1% of the population already infected,that after 76 days 77% of the population will be infected.

For this set of parameters 28% of the population will be infected after 83 days. However, the peak of the number of sick people is at 8% and it happens about 26 days after the first 1% of the population is infected. This number is still far above of what can be handled by the current number of hospital beds and emergency equipment available. However, it does support our initial hypothesis that under the same conditions, one would expect a slower growth rate in a less dense population.To confirm that mobility is still a big factor we repeat the simulation for the samplerepresentative of Chicago with D = 50m 2 /day. The results are shown in FIG. 5. Under these conditions, only 7% of the population will be infected with the peak of sick people Average of 50 90-day simulations of the spread of a virus in a population of 100 individuals in a square cell with the population density of NYC (\u03c1 = 0.012 people/m 2 ).

This shows that under this model large mobility in high density population wold lead to more severe spread of the infection. A more black box option would be to resort to the NDlib Python library that models diffusion processes over complex networks. 23 Average of 50 90-day simulations of the spread of a virus in a population of 100 individuals in a square cell with the population density of CHI (\u03c1 = 0.0047 people/m 2 ). D = 50m 2 /day,prob = 0.1, dt = 0.01day.This project can help students understand particle diffusion and extrapolate some of its findings into a timely phenomenon such as viral infection. It is interesting to note that these parameters do not tell the whole story. For instance,FIG. 1is showing that the growth rate of case in the states of New York and Illinois are roughly the same. However, the model for the largest cities in these states predict very different growth rates. Here is an opportunity for students to discuss the shortcomings of the model and/or the initial assumptions. For instance, one can think that the mobility in a denser population is smaller than that of a less dense one. The combination of these two factors could lead, within this simple model to identical results. Looking at FIG. 5, student might ask themselves will the graphs are notsmooth. The answer of course, lies in the fact that we are simulating a small population and the changes by one individual seem to be discrete. One way to solve this issue is to increase the population.On FIG. 6we plot the results of the simulations for a population of 1000 with a population density of (\u03c1 = 0.0047 people/m 2 ) and an initial population of sick people representative of 10 (1% of the total population). One can see that the data is smoother and although the trends are similar to those shown in FIG. 5, at the end of 90 days 20% of the population is infected, while in the 100 population case this number if 6%. The peak of people that are sick peaks at roughly 5% in the 1000 population at the 40th day, while the peak for the 100 population is at 3% at the 14th day. This is an important example on the 9 need to scale the simulations to make sure the predictions are converged. Students should be directed to vary the populations size until the predictions agree. For the sake of keeping the computational time manageable for a short term project we suggest 100, Average of 50 90-day simulations of the spread of a virus in a population of 1000 individuals in a square cell with the population density of CHI (\u03c1 = 0.0047 people/m 2 ). D = 50m 2 /day,prob = 0.1, dt = 0.01day. We start with 10 sick individuals on day 1.To finalize, we show snapshots of the simulation cell and its population in FIG. 7. White spheres represent the susceptible people, red represent sick, and green are those individuals that recovered. This window is very useful for a quick analysis of what is happening and can show how the infection is spread over time. We found it useful to change the radius of the individuals so that they are visible as the population increases, and the cell size on the screen remains the same.",
