The working diagnosis was of systemic sepsis based on raised blood inflammatory markers thought to be secondary to suspected appendicitis. All patients apart from one presented with markedly elevated C-reactive protein. Further clinical details are provided in the appendix (pp 1\u20132). Patients received antibiotics and fluids, and were investigated with blood tests, urine and bloods cultures, and, in patient 4, a lumbar puncture. All patients, except for patient 6, initially had an abdominal ultrasound scan. Patients 4, 5, 6, and 7 had abdominal CT scans and patient 6 had an abdominal ultrasound following the CT. Findings on ultrasound were in line with lymphadenopathy and presence of inflammatory fat throughout the mesentery, with thickening of the terminal ileum (appendix pp 1\u20132). These findings were mirrored on CT (appendix pp 1\u20132), which represents a better modality to show a non-inflamed appendix than does ultrasonography.",

Patients 3 and 6 were initially planned for laparoscopy and appendicectomy in the local institution.

Although clinical examination should guide decision making, and ultrasound is often the only diagnostic imaging modality to exclude appendicitis in the UK, cross-sectional imaging was necessary for differential diagnosis in half (four) of our patients. Given the convincing nature of clinical findings for appendicitis in children with COVID-19, we stress the importance of abdominal imaging and a swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in all children before surgical intervention. It is important to stress the need to visualise the appendix through ultrasound, CT, or both. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be adopted in these patients and transfer to a tertiary paediatric centre should be considered early in the disease course because their condition can rapidly deteriorate. We encourage others to report their experience to better understand how COVID-19 presents in children.",
