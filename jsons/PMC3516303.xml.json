This approach assumes that, if TEs\nhave been vertically transmitted and maintained by neutral evolutionary processes in the\ngenomes of two different species since their last common ancestor, the number of synonymous\nsubstitutions per synonymous site (dS) of the TEs should be equal to or greater than that of\nthe vertically transmitted HGs. However, if the dS obtained for the TE is significantly\nlower than the dS for the vertically transferred HG, the most probable explanation is that\nthese elements were exchanged by HT between the species after their reproductive isolation.\nThis pattern can be observed because a horizontally transferred TE has spent less time in\nthe new host genome than the original HGs. These HGs have been in the genome since the last\ncommon ancestor of the species involved in the HT. Therefore, these TEs have had less time\nto accumulate synonymous substitutions than the HGs. It is noteworthy to state that even if\na TE shows a dS value equal to or greater than the HG dS, it does not necessarily imply\nvertical transmission (VT). This pattern can also be generated by an HTT event occurring\njust after the split of the involved species. For these comparisons, it is necessary to\nchoose HGs with similar codon usages to those of the TEs (Silva and Kidwell 2000; Ludwig et al. 2008). If an HG with a higher codon usage bias is chosen, it can\npresent low dS values and results in the underestimation of the number of HTT events (Silva and Kidwell 2000; Vidal et al. 2009).",

Differences in the codon usage bias are\nexpected to be higher among genomes from different species than among the genes within the\ngenome of the same species. According to this premise, it should be possible to detect the\nrecent invasion of a genome by TEs from the patterns of codon usage bias because the\nTE\u2019s codon usage should be more homologous to that of the donor species than that of\nthe receptor species. Recently, Rodelsperger and\nSommer (2011) showed the utility of this methodology for detecting HTT events\nbetween a beetle species and its associated nematode.

However, HTT events can occur among\nindividuals encompassing any taxonomic level, from different phyla to closely related\nspecies (Bartolom\u00e9 et al. 2009). It is\nvery difficult to prove HTT among closely related species, and in this case, the sharing of\nTEs between species can be the result of the occasional cross-fertilization between species.\nIntrogression events between closely related species can generate significantly lower dS\nvalues for the TEs compared with the nonintrogressed HGs.

Introgression events normally maintain synteny among the species involved\nin the hybridization; in other words, homology and high identity are encountered not only in\nthe TE sequences but also in the neighboring DNA regions (fig. 1D). However, when HTT events occur, only\nvariability with the absence of synteny is typically encountered in the TE-neighboring\nregions (Fortune et al. 2008) (fig. 1C). Nevertheless, despite the\nfact that this methodology is consistent and straightforward, it has yet to be tested, and\nit could proved to be particularly difficult to evaluate the synteny of TEs because of their\ninherent mobility. It is likely that this methodology will be restricted to the analysis of\nnonautonomous TEs, but even nonautonomous elements can be mobilized by other TEs in trans, a\nfactor that would complicate the analysis. Regardless, if synteny is found, it is taken as\nevidence that hybridization occurred; therefore, in the absence of synteny, the probability\nthat the sharing of TEs between species as the result of hybridization decreases, whereas\nthe probability of an HTT event increases.",

Domestication can be detected\nusing features such as copy number, orthologous position, and evaluating the selective\nconstraint (dN:dS ratio) acting between the TEs that are incongruent with the host\nspecies\u2019 phylogeny and comparing this constraint with the selective constraint on the\nHGs. Thereby, we can discern whether the HS found between the TEs from different host\nspecies is due to domestication events, different evolutionary rates, or ancestral\npolymorphism. Other analyses can also reveal clues as to whether a TE is domesticated, such\nas the presence of only one TE copy in the genome or the observation that the TEs occur at\northologous positions in different species (Sinzelle\net al. 2009). Another approach that can be used to gather clues about TE\ndomestication is the analysis of full-length TE copies (including inverted terminal repeats,\nlong terminal repeats, and coding and noncoding regions). If there are high similarities\nalong all the TE sequences, the best explanation for the sequence conservation is the\noccurrence of an HTT event. This is because TE domestication only imposes strong selective\nconstraints on one region of a TE and not in the full-length copies (Feschotte 2008; Sinzelle et\nal. 2009). Even if a domestication occurred, a dS TE smaller than dS HG is unlikely\nto be observed, because negative selection acts only in nonsynonymous substitutions and not\nover neutral synonymous substitutions. Therefore, we also can evaluate if occurred HT events\nbefore the domestication event using the dS analysis (T1 in fig. 1).",

A second type of analysis can be performed\nwhen the entire host genome is available. In this case, an ancestral sequence can be\ninferred when evaluating many copies of one horizontally transferred element. This analysis\nis based on the premise that these elements have been evolving neutrally since the HT event;\ntherefore, we can estimate the time of the first insertion event and the subsequent\namplification inside of the host genome using a neutral substitution rate (Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002; Yang et al. 2004; Khan et al. 2006; Pace and\nFeschotte 2007).

To date, 178 of the\n330 HTT cases described in the literature were detected among Drosophila\nspecies (54%).

When we look at all the previously\ndescribed examples of HTT involving LTR retrotransposons, we note that 88.88% (104\nof 117) of the events are among species from the same genus, 3.41% (4 of 117) occur\namong species from different genera, 6.83% (8 of 117) occur among species from\ndifferent orders, and only one event was observed among species from different phyla.\nHowever, the tendency for a higher frequency of LTR retrotransposon HTT events among\nclosely related species could represent a strong taxonomic bias because 74 of the 86\ndescribed HTT events involving retrotransposons were described in the\nDrosophila. Regarding the HTT waves, one study reported that\nretrotransposon HTT waves occurred among Drosophila species (de Setta et al. 2009). Because of this, future\nstudies are required to evaluate whether the LTR retrotransposon HTT events also occur\nmore frequently among closely related species in other taxa.",

For example, successful TE invasions by HT\nare less likely in species with a higher\nNe\u00b5 and shorter generation times\nbecause there is an increased probability of the TE being inactivated. The influence of\nthe Ne is a result of the balance between natural selection\nand genetic drift (Lynch and Conery 2003).\nThe genomes of host species with large population sizes, as many unicellular organisms\npossess, are also subject to a strong purifying selection (Lynch 2007). Thus, if an HTT event occurs in these species, the\nprobability that the TEs will be quickly eliminated by natural selection is high. On the\nother hand, in species with small population sizes, such as many tetrapods, genetic drift\nincreases the probability that a new TE will be maintained in the host genome following an\nHTT event. Lynch and Coney (2003) reported\nthat host species should have an Ne less than approximately\nequal to 7 \u00d7 107 to allow retrotransposon proliferation and an\nNe less than approximately equal to 2 \u00d7 107\nto allow the proliferation of DNA transposons.",

The inability to detect HTT results from the high turnover of\nTEs in host genomes (Lerat et al. 2003).

The individuals bearing these detrimental changes can then be\neliminated by natural selection, hence abolishing the signal of the primary invasion. When\nTEs successfully invade and are maintained in a new genome, the TE copies will evolve under\nneutral or weak natural selection (Silva and Kidwell\n2000). Both low-dS measures obtained from the TEs compared with the HGs and\nspecies-specific codon usage biases from donor species tend to degenerate over the course of\ntime. Thus, the more ancient an HTT event, the more difficult it will be to detect (fig. 3A). This promotes a weak\nsignal of HTT events, leading to underestimation (fig.\n3B). ",
