That has led to increased concerns about HCoVs, while the identification of MERS-CoV in 2012 reinforced the public health significance of HCoVs. Although SARS-CoV is no longer detected since 2004, MERS-CoV continued as an epidemic, spreading to more patients and countries. This spread indicates a high adaption capability of MERS-CoV in humans.5, 6 Insight into the epidemic characteristics of HCoVs at the molecular level will allow us to predict viral pathogenesis and transmission activities and inform HCoV prevention and control, particularly against newly emerging HCoVs.",

The genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 was first reported in Belgium in 2005 and three clusters were identified based on the analysis of the spike (S) gene of the prototype strain ATCC VR-759 and seven clinical strains.11 Subsequently, Lau et al. gave the first description on the molecular epidemiology of HCoV-OC43 using sequences from 29 clinical samples in 2011.12 Four genotypes, A, B, C and D, were identified based on the viral genome and the phylogeny of the main structural genes, S, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and genotype D was reported to have arisen due to natural recombination.12 However, these observations were based on only a limited number of HCoV-OC43 positive cases. Due to the limited availability of virus sequences, the molecular epidemiological characterization of HCoV-OC43, particularly its genotyping, was poorly deciphered.",

Eleven CN strains fell into genotype B together with five 2004 HK strains and the Belgium strain BE03.11, 12 The sequences of this genotype possessed nucleotide (nt) identities of 98.7%\u201399.6%.

To further demonstrate the emergence of genotype E strains, we amplified the whole viral genome sequences directly from respiratory samples. We obtained the whole genome sequences of four of the five distinct strains (1783A/10, 2058A/10, 3074A/12 and 3194A/12; 2194A/11 was not available due to the very low viral load in the specimen). We then analyzed the potential recombination by constructing the phylogenetic trees of all known 23 gene regions of these four strains. Ten other whole genome sequences of OC43 were used as reference strains, including BE03 and 2145A/10 (genotype B), HK04-01 and 3647/06 (genotype C), BE04, HK04-02 and 5240/07 (genotype D), and the ATCC strain (genotype A) (Fig. 2\n).

This highlights again the role of recombination in the evolution of HCoV-OC43. Based on nucleotide identity comparison, phylogenetic analysis of different genes, and boot scanning analysis, genotype E might be generated from a recombination between genotypes B, C and D. Potential recombination sites may be at the junctions of nsp2/nsp3, nsp6/nsp7, nsp9/nsp10, nsp12/nsp13, ns5\u03b1/E and M/N gene. However, these observations need to be clarified based on more whole genome sequences of OC43. In addition, our results together with those of previous reports on the recombination analysis of HCoVs, indicate that the amplification of genes including at least nsp2/nsp3, nsp12/nsp13 (corresponding to pol gene) and the S and N genes is needed for genotyping and recombination analysis.12, 20, 26\n",
