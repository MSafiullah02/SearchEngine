The haematological and immune reconstitution in both groups was rapid with normal levels of neutrophils, platelets, lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, CD56+ cells, and an increased level of B cells and CD8+ T cells at 3 months. The percentage of CD3+ T cells was low, primarily due to the delayed reconstitution of CD4 T cells, which led to an inverse CD4/CD8 ratio which also persisted 12 months post transplantation. Importantly, we did not observe significant differences in the reconstitution of any of these cell types between patients receiving either purified CD34+ cells or PBPC as stem cell support, except for somewhat lower levels of CD56+ cells in the PBPC group at 12 months.",

In contrast to some previous reports,34,35 we found normal immunoglobulin levels at both 3 and 12 months in both groups. The median values of the absolute lymphocyte number in both groups at 3 and 12 months were above the upper normal range. Thus, the high percentage of B cells observed at both 3 and 12 months most likely reflects an increased number of B cells present. Similar results have also been observed by Mackall et al35 in children and young adults giving a median of 7.2 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cell/kg.",

It is not settled whether the use of CD34+ cell selection causes a higher incidence of post-transplant infections.3,19,21,23,24,38 We found no difference between the HD groups in the number of infections, days with fever, days on i.v. antibiotics during the first 30 days after HDT. Furthermore, the number of infections after discharge from hospital was comparable between the groups. A severe fungal infection was observed in only one patient (PBPC group). Some data indicate a relationship between CMV infection and the use of purified CD34+ cells infused.20,39 We did not observe any clinical CMV infections either in the CD34+ group or in the PBPC group in our study.",

Any conclusion on improved survival using CD34+ cells are premature as the observation time is still short and differs between the groups, and, unlike in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, even late relapses may occur after HDT. A potential prognostic difference between the two groups can only be confirmed by a larger prospective randomised trial.",
