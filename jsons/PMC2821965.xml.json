This property minimally impacts viral or foreign gene expression, because MVA continues to replicate its DNA with concomitant robust transcriptional activity until its life cycle is interrupted by a late block in viral assembly. In addition, MVA has a large foreign gene capacity as a result of multiple deletions that were created in its original development during passage in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) [2]. MVA has a well-established safety record and history of use as a vaccine [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The virus has superior properties of inducing potent humoral and cellular immunity which has lead to MVA based vaccines for treatment of infectious disease and cancer, with some having successfully entered Phase I/II clinical trials [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].",

Two examples of vaccinia promoters widely used to direct foreign gene expression in rMVA are the synthetic promoter (pSyn), which contains both vaccinia early and late promoter sequences optimized for high level protein expression [15] and the modified H5 promoter (mH5) which contains both native early and late vaccinia promoter regions [16]. pSyn has stronger overall promoter activity than mH5, but the early activity of the mH5 promoter is three-five fold stronger than the pSyn series [16]. While MVA as a viral vector has virtues including its large foreign gene capacity and multiple integration sites [17], only a few investigations of genetic stability of rMVA have been reported [16], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].",

These viral vectors promote substantial immunogenicity either when evaluated in vitro to propagate existing T cell memory populations, or in vivo in mouse models as primary immunizations [26].

Additional MVA transfer plasmids were constructed after replacement of pSyn with the mH5 promoter. We first replaced the two pSyn promoters in pZWIIA with one mH5 promoter. Briefly, a 228 bp DNA fragment including the 70 bp mH5 promoter sequences and multiple cloning sites was synthesized (Genebank accession # FJ386852) and cloned into pZERO-2 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). This 228 bp DNA fragment was excised with Xho I and Not I, gel purified and cloned into pZWIIA to yield mH5-pZWIIA. We then modified mH5-pZWIIA and replaced the bacterial gus (\u03b2-glucoronidase) marker gene with the Venus\u2122 fluorescent marker gene (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) to improve the speed of rMVA screening. The CMV pp65 gene was cloned into mH5-pZWIIA to yield mH5-pp65-pZWIIA. The IEfusion gene was cloned into mH5-pZWIIA to yield mH5-IEfusion-pZWIIA, an MVA transfer plasmid used to generate mH5-IEfusion-MVA. To make rMVA expressing both pp65 and IEfusion protein simultaneously, a new MVA transfer vector that contained mH5 promoter and targets MVA deletion III region was constructed based on the pLW51 plasmid. We modified pLW51 by replacing the original expression cassette by excision at XhoI and AscI sites and inserted the mH5 promoter followed by the CMV pp65 gene to yield mH5-pp65-pLW51. The structure of MVA transfer vectors (mH5-pp65-pZWIIA, mH5-IEfusion-pZWIIA and mH5-pp65-pLW51) were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequence analysis.",

After each time point, cells were immediately pelleted, then lysed in 1.0 mL PBS containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.1% SDS in the presence of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA). Supernatants (0.5 mL) were precleared once with 50 \u03bcL of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Sequential incubation with 2.4 \u03bcg purified mAb against CMV-pp65 (mAb 28\u2013103 [43]) was followed by an isotope-specific mAb (19C2 [32]) for 2 h. Immune complexes were captured by incubation for 1 h with 50 \u03bcL of protein A/G beads. The immune complex bound Protein A/G beads were washed 4 times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 0.2% SDS, 5 mM DTT, 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) into SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using X-OMAT film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA).",

Each virus sample was considered to be a single isolate, because the equivalent of 0.5 pfu of virus was distributed in each well. Viral infection from these collected samples was confirmed by continuous virus growth and virus titration. CMV-pp65 expression levels were measured, and it was discovered that 40% (8 of the 18) individual isolates had lost CMV-pp65 expression from P10 (Fig. 1C).

Two isolates with full expression levels, two isolates that lost CMV-pp65 protein expression (#4, #6 in Fig. 1C) and two isolates that retained CMV-pp65 expression from P10 (#7, #13 in Fig. 1C) were further investigated. WB blot was performed to detect both CMV-pp65 and IE1 protein expression levels, and Southern blot (SB) to detect CMV-pp65 and IE1 expression cassettes from viral DNA. Similarly, a mAb specific for the MVA BR5 viral protein was used to probe lysates in a separate WB to detect endogenous viral gene expression to control for virus input in all six samples (Fig. 2A, iii). The two individual isolates from P10 that maintained CMV-pp65 expression also expressed IE1 at similar level as P1 (Fig. 2A, i). In contrast, the two isolates from P10 that lost CMV-pp65 expression also coordinately lost IE1 protein expression (Fig. 2A, i and ii). Interestingly, in all 4 cases, there was either coordinate expression of both antigens or their absence, suggesting that the whole cassette was either maintained or inactivated by deletion or mutation when protein expression was not detected. In contrast, the expression of the MVA BR5 protein remained uniformly unchanged (Fig. 2A, iii).",

The gene expression cassette was detected in two individual virus isolates from P1 and P10 (lanes 1, 2, 5, 6 in Fig. 2B), but not detected in two viral isolates from P10 that also lost protein expression (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2B). The del II site of MVA was further analyzed by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis of MVA genomic DNA and by PCR using a series of primers that target the surrounding del II region. It was found that CMV-pp65 and IE1 gene expression cassettes together with the surrounding MVA del II region were absent (data not shown). The possibility was excluded that the two non-expressing mutants were contaminant wt MVA virus that was introduced and amplified during the serial passage using additional qPCR primers (data not shown). The isolates that maintained CMV-pp65 and IE1/e4 expression shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1 and 2) were tested to see if they represented stabilized forms of each gene in the virus, pSyn-pp65-IE1/e4-MVA, during serial passage. The two p10 isolates were sequentially passaged for an additional 10 rounds on CEF. We discovered that both CMV-pp65 and IE1 protein expression still decreased at the conclusion of additional serial passage (data not shown).

            "text": "We proceeded to construct a single rMVA simultaneously expressing both CMV-pp65 and IEfusion proteins using dual mH5 promoters by evaluating two different strategies. In the 1st strategy, an MVA expressing all three antigens was constructed by targeting a single integration site (del II) with a plasmid shuttle vector that had tandem mH5 promoters in opposing orientation (data not shown). It could not be stably prepared, possibly due to intra-molecular homologous recombination, presumably initiated by the identical mH5 promoter copies (data not shown). In the second strategy, the CMV-pp65 and IEfusion genes were inserted at two separate sites in MVA (del II located at 149,261 and del III located at 20,625 of the MVA genome) to prevent deletional recombination mediated by the two identical copies of the mH5 promoter. A schematic picture of the structure of this rMVA and the insertion sites are shown in Fig. 5A. This virus was successfully constructed, and passaged 10 times in a similar manner as was done for the pSyn viruses (Fig. 4A and B). The passages were conducted on both BHK-21 (Fig. 5C) and CEF (Fig. 5D). The genetic stability was evaluated by qPCR using 3 primer pairs specific for the CMV-pp65 and IEfusion genes, and the MVA viral genomic backbone, respectively. The qPCR results for both CMV antigens are computed as a ratio to the viral genomic MVA backbone (Fig. 5C). Excellent stability was found for both CMV gene inserts at del II and III integration sites with almost 100% of each gene copy number maintained after 10 passages compared to P0 (Fig. 5C). A similar result was found with virus passaged on CEF, using the CMV-pp65 and the MVA backbone sequences as targets for qPCR (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that the choice of cell line is a minor or insignificant component to the findings of enhanced stability of MVA viruses using the mH5 promoter.",

To exclude this possibility, several additional pairs of primers targeting different regions of CMV-pp65 and IEfusion gene were designed.

Equivalent immunogenicity of both P7 and P1 passages (p\n = NS by Student t-test) (Fig. 6A) was observed. The qualitative differences between T cell subsets in PBMC from four healthy volunteers stimulated by individual CMV antigens are not altered after 7 passages.

Ara-C (cytosine \u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside) is a deoxycytidine analog which incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA replication by forming cleavage complexes with topoisomerase I resulting in DNA fragmentation [44]. It is a selective inhibitor of DNA synthesis that does not affect RNA synthesis in mammalian cells [45] and so can be used to distinguish early and late protein expression in cells and the timing of transcriptional activation of the mH5 and pSyn promoters. Quantitative WB employing \u03b2-tubulin was used as an internal standard to compare CMV-pp65 expression levels in lysates from cells infected with either mH5-pp65-MVA or with pSyn-pp65-MVA in the absence or presence of Ara-C. In the absence of Ara-C, similar CMV-pp65 protein expression levels were observed in both mH5-pp65-MVA-infected and in pSyn-pp65-MVA-infected cells. However, in the presence of Ara-C, there was a remarkable 7-fold higher level of CMV-pp65 expression in cells infected with mH5-pp65-MVA versus cells infected with pSyn-pp65-MVA. Early CMV-pp65 expression from mH5-pp65-MVA accounted for 40% of total CMV-pp65, while early CMV-pp65 expression in pSyn-pp65-MVA constituted only 6% of total CMV-pp65 protein (Table 2\n). The effect of Ara-C on the pSyn and mH5 promoters is consistent with earlier studies [15], [16].",

The reduction in expression might be explained by differential protein stability when the pSyn promoter is used, rather than timing of expression we proposed based on experiments shown in Table 1. Consequently, we used an approach of metabolic radio-labeling of MVA-infected CEF (Fig. 7\n) and BHK-21 cells (data not shown), followed by cold chase to measure the disappearance of radiolabeled CMV-pp65 protein, which is a measure of its stability to degradation. The approach closely followed our previous work using VV expressing CMV-pp65 [42]. We utilized 3 time points of cold chase through 10 h, as this time frame is sufficient to measure differences in protein stability based on prior work with CMV-pp65. The infection conditions of CEF and BHK-21 cells closely followed our analysis of protein expression in Fig. 1, Fig. 2. The change in labeled CMV-pp65 is limited over the 1st 4 h of chase, with only a minimal decline at the 10 h time point for both promoter constructs (Fig. 7). The pattern of CMV-pp65 expression and stability is equivalent when either the mH5 or pSyn constructs were evaluated. The specificity of the recognition of radiolabeled CMV-pp65 is shown by the absence of an equivalent CMV-pp65-specific radiolabeled band in the Gus-MVA infected control lane. Similar to the prior study using VV expressing CMV-pp65, two closely juxtaposed bands are found after IP with mAb 28\u2013103. Based on the differences in the CMV-pp65 decay profile with the non-specific band in the prior study, the lower band reflects the bona-fide protein, while the upper band is likely a contaminant. Moreover, examining the same extracts using an isotype control mAb shows absolute specificity for the pp65 protein (data not shown). We conclude that the choice of promoter does not dramatically influence the degradation rate of the CMV-pp65 antigen. Consequently, protein stability is likely not a factor in determining the stability characteristics of both MVA expressing CMV-pp65.",

Our data showed that CMV-pp65 and IE1/e4 protein expression levels decreased significantly during the latter passages, especially after P6. The reduction of CMV-pp65 and IE1 expression was likely caused by genetic changes in rMVA that result in non-expressing variants which lost the entire gene expression cassette during sequential passage. In addition, it was found that later passages of pSyn-containing viruses had reduced immunogenicity measured using the IFN-\u03b3 assay in HHD II mice. We attribute the reduced immunogenicity to the population of viruses having fewer clones still expressing CMV-pp65 and IE1 compared to the earlier passages. This is consistent with previous reports that in vitro expression levels of recombinant antigens in MVA vaccines specific for HIV are correlated with immunogenicity [46]. Other examples of viral vectors in which stability through passage is influence by the recombinant insert have been observed. These examples include coronaviruses [47], West Nile Virus replicons [48], potexvirus [49] and the Lister strain, another poxvirus member [50]. Therefore, we evaluated the genetic stability of rMVA expressing CMV viral genes using the alternative mH5 promoter. It was found that the mH5 promoter can improve genetic stability of insert genes in rMVA while maintaining potent immunogenicity during extended virus passage.",

Although these methods are technically simple, they are labor intensive. The qPCR method we developed to measure genetic stability is sensitive, high-throughput, and reproducible. A prior approach using the TaqMan assay also can be adapted for stability testing [51]. Genetic stability as defined by computing the ratio of the foreign protein gene and MVA genomic backbone gene copies at each passage correlated with foreign insert protein expression levels at each passage (data not shown). qPCR was used to demonstrate that pSyn-pp65-IE1/e4-MVA was unstable, as only 70% of CMV-pp65 and IE1/e4 insert gene copies remained after 10 passages. pSyn-pp65-IEfusion-MVA was even more highly unstable, such that only 10% of the CMV-pp65 and IEfusion gene copies remained after five consecutive passages.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism for genetic instability of rMVA using pSyn promoter and improved genetic stability using mH5 promoter has yet to be fully investigated. The cause for the instability of rMVA might be due to high protein expression levels leading to toxicity of the gene products to the cells which are infected by the rMVA, since pSyn promoter is optimized for the highest attainable levels of transcriptional activity [15], [22]. However, metabolic radio-labeling, followed by cold chase established the equivalent stability of the CMV-pp65 antigen expressed from either the mH5 or pSyn promoter construct before passage. Our conclusions must be tempered by the fact we cannot completely exclude that properties of the inserts may have contributed to vector genetic instability in unpredictable ways. For instance, the combination of CMV-pp65 and IE1/e4 genes using a single integration site was only evaluated using the pSyn promoter, and not fully reconstructed using the mH5 promoter. However, we did observe even greater instability when the IEfusion gene replaced the IE1/e4 sequence in the context of the pSyn promoter. In contrast, we have not observed marked instability of any of the gene products we examined in this report in the context of the mH5 promoter, although the combination of genes and insertion sites are not identically comparable to the pSyn series. Similar problems have been noted by others in regards to HIV-Env and the measles virus F protein expressed in MVA [21], [52]. In both cases, toxicity of the expressed protein contributed to genetic instability of the rMVA expressing them [22]. It has been reported that rMVA expressing hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoproteins under control of the vaccinia pSyn promoter replicate poorly due to toxic levels of the gene product [16]. The rMVA expressing PIV3 F and HN genes under control of pSyn replicates poorly whereas rMVA expressing both genes under control of mH5 promoter can replicate to high titer in CEF cells due to less expression of PIV3 and HN [16]. Genetic stability of rMVA was enhanced by reducing expression levels of HN glycoproteins.",

As an example, rMVA in which HIV-1 tat and gag-pol genes were inserted into an intergenic region of MVA showed no loss of stability or expression after many passages [18], [23]. We have recently explored the expression and genetic stability of the intergenic region 3 (IGR3) site by inserting the identical CMV-pp65 gene cassette that includes the mH5 promoter as shown in Fig. 5A into that region of the MVA genome. We obtained excellent expression levels and stability rivaling what we found as shown in Fig. 5B. Our conclusion is that promoter qualities of early timing and moderate expression levels are critical for vector stability. However, protein toxicity is probably the most important factor, while several integration sites impart similar levels of stability to the rMVA recombinant virus.",

            "text": "We found that rMVA expressing CMV viral proteins using pSyn promoter can grow and replicate to high titer in both BHK-21 and CEF cells (data not shown). The quantitative WB results indicated that CMV-pp65 protein expression levels are similar in promoter cassettes driven by either pSyn or mH5. This suggests that instability of rMVA using pSyn promoter is not associated with CMV-pp65 protein expression levels and that genetic stability of rMVA using mH5 promoter is not improved by reduction of CMV-pp65 protein expression levels. We cannot exclude that a component of the instability maybe imparted by the choice of cell line in selected cases, since we did not directly compare every construct in both cell lines. In those cases that we compared stability in both BHK-21 and CEF, no substantial differences were found attributable to the cell line. Results of the quantitative WB indicated that early expression of CMV-pp65 is seven-fold stronger under control of mH5 compared to the pSyn promoter. Consequently, the timing of expression, not its magnitude can be hypothesized as a mechanism to explain the increased genetic stability of rMVA using mH5 promoter. In this report a select number of gene products were investigated, therefore the conclusion drawn from our results can only be generalized to other gene products when they are evaluated in the same manner as we conducted these evaluations. However, this new finding does not exclude other mechanisms by which the mH5 promoter enhances the genetic stability of rMVA such as decreasing late expression of toxic proteins [16]. The mH5 promoter should be an important consideration in vaccine design to improve genetic stability while maintaining immunogenicity of rMVA developed for clinical application [23]. These recommendations and several others have been recently published based upon experience with HIV antigens inserted into deletion sites and intergenic regions [22], [23].",

(A) Schematic representation of mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA. (B) qPCR to determine genetic stability of 10 serial passages of mH5-pp65-MVA. mH5-pp65-MVA viral genomic DNA was extracted and qPCR was performed using pp65, and TK specific primers as described in Section 2. The copy numbers for pp65 gene and MVA backbone were analyzed using ABI software (SDS3.2) and the genetic stability of the mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA was determined by computing the ratio of the pp65 gene insert and the MVA backbone. The ratios at passage 1 were normalized to 1. The qPCR for each DNA sample were performed for three times independently in duplicates and average ratio and error bar shown in the figure represented three independent determinants. (C) qPCR to determine genetic stability of 10 serial passages of mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA. mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA genomic DNA was extracted and qPCR was performed using pp65, IEfusion and TK specific primers as described in Section 2. The copy numbers for pp65 gene, IEfusion gene and MVA backbone were analyzed using ABI software (SDS3.2) and the genetic stability of the mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA was determined by computing the ratio of the pp65 gene insert and the MVA backbone or the ratio of the IEfusion gene insert and the MVA backbone. The ratios at passage 1 for pp65 and IE1/e4 gene were normalized to 1. (D) Similar to (C) except 10 serial passages were conducted on CEF and shown are results computed using pp65 and TK-specific primers. The qPCR for each DNA sample were performed for three times independently in duplicates and the ratios and error bar shown in the figure presented average of three independent determinants.",

(A) Immunogenicity of mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA of passages 1 and 7 using human PBMC. PBMCs from healthy donors who were ex vivo positive responders to CMV antigens [29] were incubated with antigen presenting cells infected with either passage 1 or passage 7 of mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA for 7 days followed by overnight incubation with diluent (mock), pp65, IE1 or IE2 peptide libraries in the presence of brefeldin A. Cells were then harvested and stained with anti-human CD8 or CD4 mAb, permeabilized and stained with anti-human IFN-\u03b3 mAb and evaluated by flow cytometry. Average percentages of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8 or CD4 lymphocytes are shown (N = 4). Error bars represent standard deviation. (B) Immunogenicity of mH5-pp65-mH5-IEfusion-MVA of passages 1 and 7 in HHD II mice (HLA A2.1). Splenocytes from HHD II mice immunized with mH5-pp65-IEfusion-MVA from passage 1 (P1) or passage 7 (P7) were subjected to IVS separately with either pp65A2, IE1A2 peptides or IE2 peptide library loaded HLA-A*0201 EBV-lymphoblastoid cells (LCL) derived from a healthy CMV positive volunteer [39] for 8 days. After IVS, the splenocytes were incubated with mock A2, pp65A2, IE1A2 peptides or IE2 peptide library overnight and harvested for ICC described in Section 2.
