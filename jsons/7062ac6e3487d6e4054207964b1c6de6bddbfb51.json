Influenza A and B viruses (family Orthomyxoviridae, genus Influenzavirus A and B) are frequently detected at all ages, but a variety of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, cause similar symptoms that cannot be differentiated without laboratory confirmation. In Lao PDR, the influenza sentinel network was initiated only in 2007 3 and other respiratory viruses are normally not diagnosed. 3, 4 In particular, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; order Mononegavirales, family Pneumoviridae, genus Orthopneumovirus, and species human orthopneumovirus) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children worldwide. 5 A proper understanding of the etiology, seasonal patterns, and genetic diversity of respiratory viruses in Lao PDR is warranted. Notably, the success of the influenza vaccination recently introduced in the country relies on recommendations for optimal timing with respect to the season with highest influenza transmission. This is still poorly understood in subtropical countries. Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with acute respiratory infections at the Luang Prabang Provincial Hospital in Northern Laos, catering to highland communities in Northern Laos, were screened for 13 viruses.",

All samples were tested by the two laboratories to compare detection rates of the in-house PCRs against commercial tests and to broaden the range of pathogens detected. Results of conventional PCRs were visualized on an agarose gel, and positivity was confirmed by sequencing on an ABI 3130 Avant Capillary Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk, The Netherlands) using the PCR primers also as sequencing primers. The ectodomain of the G-gene of RSV was also amplified as described before 14 and sequenced (GenBank accession numbers MG773863-MG773881).",

            "text": "over longer time periods.In 2012, Lao PDR started to offer seasonal influenza vaccination in April-May to pregnant women, the elderly, patients with comorbidities, and health care personnel.27 Based on retrospective surveillance data from 2008-201128 and 2010-201429 with increased transmission in August-December or September-November, respectively, the optimal timing for vaccination was recommended in April-June.28,29 In our 2010-2011 study, increased transmission of influenza viruses was observed between August and December, indicating that, if already implemented, vaccination during the recommended period would likely have had a beneficial effect on the 2010 influenza season. As surveillance efforts increase worldwide, it becomes apparent that influenza seasonality in the (sub) tropics are country or even region-specific30 and may also differ between years. For instance, two waves of increased influenza transmission were observed in Lao PDR in 2014 and 2015 (www. who.int/flunet), complicating the current vaccination timing. Offering vaccination twice a year (eg, April-May and October-November) to the general or even a selected population would be challenging in practice, as already attempted in 2012 in Peru, 29 a country that has influenza seasons varying by climate zones. 31 Thus, continuing surveillance efforts in Lao PDR are warranted to characterize potential regional and annual variations of influenza seasons, and to estimate the influenza disease burden due to waning of vaccineinduced antibodies at the time of a secondary influenza transmission period to optimize vaccination recommendations. In the meantime, the target population such as pregnant women enrolled in antenatal care programs could be readily vaccinated at any time of the year, provided that the most recent vaccine formulation is available. In this study, RSV strains circulating in Lao PDR were characterized for the first time, with the detection of the common genotypes of RSV-A NA1, RSV-B BA9, and the rare CB1/THB genotype. Cocirculation of different genotypes in a country during RSV season is not uncommon. 32,33 Most RSV genotypes are often shared between various regions of the world. For instance, after its first characterization in Canada in 2010, 34 the RSV-A ON1 genotype rapidly spread throughout the world, with at least 21 countries reporting it by 2014. 35 Luang Prabang attracts a lot of foreign tourists; therefore, the presence of the global genotypes RSV-A NA1 and RSV-B BA9 18,25 is not surprising. In contrast, genotype RSV-B CB1/THB has only very rarely been detected in Asia (China, Thailand, India, and Lao PDR; see Figure 2), as early as 2000-2004 but mainly between 2009 and 2012. 18-20 This may be indicative of differences in virulence or cross-protective immunogenicity with other genotypes. Further genotyping of RSV strains, conclusion, 70% of acute respiratory infections in outpatients in Provincial Hospital in Northern Laos had a viral etiology. While some viruses contributed to the background incidence throughout the year, others were mainly detected during the dry season (PIV3, hMPV, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, hAdV, and hBoV). Influenza and RSV infections presented as a single wave during the wet season, providing further support to a single vaccination against influenza before the onset of the rains. While otherwise very rare, the RSV-B CB1/THB genotype cocirculated with other common genotypes. Antibiotics should be prescribed with care in the case of uncomplicated respiratory infections 36 and the timing of vaccination against influenza may be further optimized. Revised guidelines for the treatment and prevention of respiratory infections in Lao PDR, as well as increased surveillance efforts, are therefore needed.",
