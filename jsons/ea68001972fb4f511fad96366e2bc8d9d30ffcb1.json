All the following criteria had to be met for hospital discharge: 1) normal temperature lasting longer than 3 days; 2) resolved respiratory symptoms; 3) substantially improved acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography (CT) images; 4) 2 consecutively negative RT-PCR test results separated by at least 1 day. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients upon enrollment according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committee of the local hospital. Data were presented as percentages for categorical variables and median\u00b1IQR (Inter Quartile Range) for continuous variables. Simple t test and Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables.",
