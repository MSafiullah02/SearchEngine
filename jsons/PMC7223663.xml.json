In humans, infection occurs upon consumption of insufficiently cooked meat derived from infected animals or foods contaminated with soil containing Toxoplasma gondii oocysts shed from infected cats (Black and Boothroyd 2000). Primary infection of pregnant women causes miscarriage, fetal encephalopathy, convulsions, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification, and other symptoms (Demar et al. 2012; Campos et al. 2014; Fallahi et al. 2018). Toxoplasma employs various survival strategies, such as intracellular parasitism and immune disturbance, to escape from the host\u2019s immune response, so vaccine development is extremely difficult. The current anti-protozoan drugs however do not efficiently target the bradyzoite stage, but rather may induce latent infection.",

In this study, a validated kinase inhibitor library was screened for anti-Toxoplasma activity and host cell cytotoxicity.

Tyrphostin AG1295 exhibits considerable host cell cytotoxicity. Of the 6 kinase inhibitors, 4 compounds (piceatannol, Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295, and PD-98059) showed Toxoplasma gondii invasion inhibition activity. The kinase inhibitors daidzein, Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295, and PD-98059 strongly inhibited Toxoplasma growth, but lacked strong bradyzoite-inducing capacity at the tested concentration of 25 \u03bcM.

            "text": "While therapy exists for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, it is suboptimal and there is a need for new therapeutic agents with fewer side effects and for agents that are active against latent infection. The use of a bradyzoite reporter parasite facilitates the evaluation of compounds for their effects against both tachyzoites and bradyzoites. We identified four compounds (daidzein, Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295, and PD-98059) that showed promising anti-Toxoplasma activity but did not induce bradyzoite formation. This is desirable, given that current treatment options, like pyrimethamine, do not prevent bradyzoite formation, and more importantly, there is currently no treatment option to combat bradyzoites formed in tissue cysts. The screening method described in this study represents a strategy to identify anti-Toxoplasma compounds that have both Toxoplasma growth inhibition and bradyzoite induction capability. Several drugs that target these latent parasites have recently been identified and include a bumped kinase inhibitor (Doggett et al. 2014) and protein kinase inhibitor (Wei and Liu 2013) that targets T. gondii CDPK1 (Sugi et al. 2010), and endochin-like quinolones (Doggett et al. 2012), which inhibit the cytochrome bc1 complex. The activity of these compounds toward bradyzoites suggests that therapeutic agents can be found to treat latent infection caused by this parasite. Additional screens using the approach presented here should help identify more lead compounds, and it is likely that one of these leads will result in a clinically effective new therapy for the treatment of the chronic infection. Furthermore, to meet the need for new antimicrobial therapies, we are driving the screening of wider ranges of chemical compounds to identify those with anti-parasitic activity (Adeyemi et al. 2017, 2018).",

Most of the hit compounds identified in this study have not been previously reported to have anti-T. gondii activity, except for daidzein which were reported previously by us (Adeyemi et al. 2018).
