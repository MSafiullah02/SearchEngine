            "text": "The paradox of enrichment (PoE) phenomenon in population ecology was first proposed by Michael Rosenzweig in 1971  [1]. Rosenzweig observed that enrichment may destroy the steady state of a predator\u2013prey system. He formulated his model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and considered enrichment by increasing the prey-carrying capacity. He observed that this gradually leads to destabilization of the system, usually into a limit cycle. This cyclical pattern was further studied by May  [2] and Gilpin and Rosenzweig  [3]. Enrichment leads to destabilization of the equilibrium of the Rosenzweig and many other models  [4]; huge amplitudes occur that frequently drive population densities to very low values and this may result in extinction. The word \u201cparadox\u201d is used because enrichment leads to extinction. Since the 1990s, the word \u201cparadox\u201d has also been associated with the fact that destabilization is not always (or rarely) observed in natural environments, as discussed by Jensen and Ginzburg  [5]. They reviewed the literature on experimental attempts to demonstrate PoE and found an insufficient number of studies in favor of PoE. Some commonly misinterpreted examples and experiments (artificial lake eutrophication, Didinium\u2013Paramecium systems  [6], [7], Rotifer\u2013Algae systems  [8]) addressing the question of whether PoE exists need further discussion.",

            "text": "Several theoretical and empirical studies have been carried out in attempts to explain the PoE phenomenon. Roy and Chattopadhyay provide a detailed review of the studies and a brief overview of the proposed solutions  [4]. They described some reasonable mechanisms, such as the presence of inedible prey, invulnerable prey, unpalatable prey, ratio-dependent functional responses, spatiotemporal chaos, inducible defense, density-dependent predator mortality and toxic food, to resolve the paradoxical outcome of ecosystem enrichment. Several additional mechanisms have also been proposed. For example, Abrams and Roth proposed refuges and immigration as a possible solution  [9]. More recently, Mougi and Nishimura showed that rapid trait evolution of predator\u2013prey species can stabilize the system  [10]. An imperfect optimal foraging mechanism was proposed by Mougi and Nishimura  [11]. Rall et al. predicted that a sigmoidal or predator inference functional response can dampen population oscillations due to enrichment that resolves PoE  [12]. Disease in ecological systems has been recognized as an essential mechanism in different ecological issues. Sharp and Pastor recently considered a density-dependent susceptible deer population, an infected population and an environmental pool of prions that infect the deer population  [13]. They showed that the disease population has the ability to dampen population oscillations. Solutions to the PoE problem have been established by several authors from diverse perspectives and dimensions, but most of the solutions have some common factors associated with the behavioral aspects of predator\u2013prey species at the individual level and inducible or morphological defense mechanisms of the prey. However, solutions that consider community-level organization are still lacking. Knowledge of how learning and memory modify behavioral responses to species is a key factor in making a crucial link between the species and community levels  [14]. Resolution of PoE via these two organizational levels can be interpreted as a microscopic- and macroscopic-level solution.",

            "text": "Memory in the biological domain in physical systems is manifest as a series of events that induce episodic memory [16], [17] containing information about past and present events and can help in making future decisions  [18]. Biological systems are also enriched with ecological memory  [19]. Memory relates to historic events and requires an entire long-term record for analysis. For example, seasonal succession of phytoplankton in lakes responds to small changes in trophic structure and natural fluctuations of gradients  [19]. Aquatic and phytoplankton systems possess a remarkable memory of climatic events [20]. Apart from such climatic phenomena, aquatic zooplankton exhibit memory-based phenomenological responses: small changes in the environment induce morphological defense organs such as helmet formation and the development of spines through cyclomorphosis  [21]. These changes are due to a mixed seasonal and genetically inherited reaction  [22] induced over long time scales, suggesting a phenotypic change through memory-based actions. Prey refuge, group hunting and prey swarming are all well-coordinated actions based on memories of past events that lead to cultural learning  [14]. Experience accrued through learning may direct anti-predator responses  [23], [24], [25]. In aquatic systems, learning of chemical cues and the production of counter responses are well documented among zooplankton  [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Westerlund remarked that, surprisingly, even \u201cdead matter has memory\u201d  [32]. A recent study by Zheng et al.  [33] revealed that discrete earthquake events are related to seismic memory.",

In other words, fractional dynamic systems in applications can adequately represent some long-term memory and non-local effects that are typical for many anomalous processes  [36]. In this calculus, a Caputo derivative implies a memory effect via convolution between an integer-order derivative and a power of time  [37]. Note that a fractional-order system is more stable than its integer counterpart since the stability domain in the complex space of eigenvalues of the linearized system for fractional differential equations (FDEs) remains contained and is larger than the corresponding domain for ordinary differential equations  [38]. FDEs also help in reducing errors arising from neglected parameters in modeling of real-life phenomena  [39].",

Local and non-local interactions were widely observed in recent outbreaks of the above diseases and the model proposed by Ahmed and Elgazzar captured these interactions. Arafa et al. also used FDEs to elegantly model childhood diseases with constant vaccination and obtained an approximate analytic solution through the homotopy analysis method  [41]. Immune systems include both antigen-specific and systematic response and involve memory. A fractional-order example of two immune effectors attacking an antigen was proposed by Hashish and Ahmed  [42]. Apart from ecology and epidemiology, FDEs have interdisciplinary applications in various fields. For example, nonlinear earthquake oscillations can be modeled using fractional derivatives  [41] and a fluid-dynamics traffic model with fractional derivatives can eliminate the efficiency arising from assumption of continuous traffic flow  [41]. Gomez et al. used a fractional temporal operator in RC equivalent circuits to modify the standard Kirchhoff law in an FDE domain  [43].",

The relationship between the locally recorded time (which is considered as flowing equably and is represented as t) and cosmic time (which is considered as flowing non-equably) \u03c4 is given by a known mathematical function gt(\u03c4). The function gt(\u03c4) describes the inhomogeneous time scale, which depends on both \u03c4 and t, which here is the last value measured for the individual time of the moving object. When t changes, the entire preceding cosmic time interval changes as well. The derivative of this distance based on local time, which is also a function of non-local time, is interpreted as the fractional derivate  [45]. In other words, the homogeneous time scale is just an ideal notion and is necessary for developing mathematical models describing inhomogeneous cosmic time and its change. Thus, the ideal model of equably flowing homogeneous time can be considered as a rough approximation of cosmic time, which is non-local  [45]. Fractional dynamical systems adequately represent some long-term memory and these non-local effects that are typical for many anomalous processes  [36]. Such non-local effects can be captured through the fractional differential operator, which has a power law form  [46].",

The experimental evidence was challenged by Jensen and Ginzburg  [5], who showed that most examples proposed as evidence of PoE are insufficient to justify the phenomenon in natural systems. A common example of PoE is the process of lake eutrophication. Enrichment of aquatic systems appears to increase the carrying capacity of producers and leads to a bloom that covers the lake. PoE may be suggested as a cause of this phenomenon, but in fact it is the limiting dissolved oxygen that is responsible for system collapse in this case, irrespective of the enrichment response. Other empirical studies using the Didinium\u2013Paramecium system were carried out by Luckinbill  [6] and Veilleux  [7]. Both authors showed that the system proposed by Gause  [57] could be modified to allow coexistence of predator and prey. Addition of methyl cellulose prevented the extinction of any of the species in the system and provided an artificial refuge for prey species. Similarly, a study of Rotifer\u2013Algae by Fussmann et al. showed that predator extinction resulted from enrichment  [8]. Similar to the experiments of Luckinbill and Veilleux, the results showed that reducing nutrient input can bring the system from a region of consistent predator extinction to a region of coexistence. Capture of this ubiquitous dynamic behavior involved in PoE remains an open problem from both theoretical and ecological perspectives.",

Naturally, these types of experiment can have various time lengths and integrate memory.

Such memories can describe current events with the collective information from preceding events, while events in the far past can often be neglected compared to contributions from the near past  [60].

Note that \u03b1 plays a key role in understanding memory effects on species. The system sensitivity with respect to \u03b1 is an important aspect to be discussed. We analyzed the sensitivity of model (3.2) with input parameter \u03b1 and output the range of K up to which the system is stable (Appendix C). We observe that when the value of \u03b1 decreases, the system has a high elasticity index, that is, the system is more sensitive with respect to \u03b1.",

However, when we incorporate the memory effect in the classical model with \u03b1\u2208(0,1), the system no longer shows a pattern of destabilization on enrichment (Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n). Fig. 4\nshows that the system has a memory threshold (\u03b1\u22480.2332) below which it is always stable, even if we further increase the carrying capacity without restriction.

            "text": "The individual-level organization discussed above is mainly associated with the behavioral aspects of predator\u2013prey relationships and inducible or morphological prey mechanisms. Learning and memory can modify these anti-predator behavioral responses, which is key to making the link between individual-level processes and higher-level organization in ecological systems  [14]. For example, prey refuge is one of the most manifest and well-coordinated actions based on memories of past events that lead to cultural learning  [14]. To illustrate this issue, we incorporated a refuge parameter in the fractional-order Rosenzweig model. The individual-level solution of PoE with a refuge effect can be obtained from model (3.2) with \u03b1=1. The community-level solution based on memory can be illustrated by model (3.2) with \u03b1\u2208(0,1). Conditions for which the modified Rosenzweig model is stable are given in Appendix B. The region of stability for the corresponding enrichment parameter (K) and refuge parameter (m) expands if we gradually increase the memory effect in comparison to a system with no memory (Fig. 5\n). Estimation of the model parameters for such a system is an important task from a data analysis perspective. The total least squares approach is suitable for this purpose and we applied this method to illustrate model (3.2) and fitted an estimated curve for a simulated data set (Appendix C). This memory phenomenon is clearly an approximate tradeoff between fractional differentiation and stability. Against this backdrop, we conclude that ecological memories can protect a system against destabilization and may represent a potential agent for resolving PoE from a new perspective using FDEs.",
