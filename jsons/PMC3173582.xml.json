            "text": "The skin contains high concentrations of antigen-presenting cells, and is thus a site capable of inducing potent immune responses. The skin is composed of multiple layers, each with characteristic resident and transient immune cell subsets. Outermost is the thin layer of the epidermis (0.05\u20130.2 mm), which is primarily made up of epithelial cells as well as Langerhans cells, melanocytes, and Merkel cells. Beneath the epidermis, the dermis is a thicker layer (1.5\u20133 mm) consisting of a network of collagen fibers. Cells of the adaptive and innate system reside in or circulate through the dermis, including macrophages, mast cells, Langerhans cells, and dermal dendritic cells. Antigen-presenting cells in the skin perform an essential role in processing incoming antigens, resulting in immune system activation or immune tolerance of self or harmless antigens (Nicolas and Guy 2008). For these reasons, it is possible that delivery of vaccines to the epidermis or dermis may result in superior immune responses compared to other anatomical sites (Glenn and Kenney 2006; Lambert and Laurent 2008; Nicolas and Guy 2008). Alternatively, an equivalent immune response could be stimulated by delivery of a smaller quantity of vaccine antigen to the skin. Either of these mechanisms could be beneficial for developing vaccines against new disease targets, improving immune responses in hard-to-treat groups, or lowering the cost of vaccine antigens, and may be particularly valuable for improving access to vaccines in low-resource settings.",

In most cases, to simplify administration, a reduced dose (10 or 20%) delivered ID was compared to the full dose delivered either subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM). Only a few studies have compared delivery of the same dose of vaccine ID and SC/IM. Further research will be needed to establish whether the potential for dose-sparing is unique to ID delivery (PATH 2009). However, some ID delivery devices in development offer additional desirable features such as needle-free delivery or improved ease of administration, which may be drivers for further adoption of ID vaccine delivery even if there is no net immunologic benefit.",

Given equivalent doses of antigen, delivery to the dermis appears to be either superior or equivalent to IM/SC (Bernard et al. 1982; Bernard et al. 1987; Fishbein et al. 1987; Phanuphak et al. 1990).

Although a salivary sIgA response was observed, the key marker of immunity, an increase in neutralizing serum IgG, was not detected (Etchart et al. 2007).",

Bifurcated needles and multipuncture devices have been used successfully for delivery of smallpox and BCG vaccines, but do not deliver reproducible quantities of vaccine antigen to the dermis and are therefore unlikely to be appropriate delivery devices for new vaccines (Lambert and Laurent 2008). The Mantoux method of inserting a needle at a shallow angle into the skin can also be inconsistent, and requires additional training and skill to perform correctly (Flynn et al. 1994). The perceived difficulty of performing an ID injection using this method may prevent development of vaccines for ID delivery. New generations of devices, such as those discussed in the rest of this article, may improve the reliability of ID delivery and enable adoption of the ID route for more vaccines.",

            "text": "The Mantoux technique is an ID injection method characterized by a needle inserted at a 5\u201315 degree angle, approximately 1 mm deep into the dermis, to inject a vaccine or drug (Fig. 1a). This method was developed by Charles Mantoux in the early 20th century, and it has been used to identify tuberculosis infection by the ID injection of tuberculin (Mantoux 1909). However, this technique requires training and is often considered an inconsistent delivery method, thus preventing vaccine makers or medical practitioners from using ID injection as a common immunization method (Lambert and Laurent 2008). Also, age or elasticity-related skin conditions have a significant effect on adequate placement of the needle in the dermis for the traditional ID injection technique (Dean et al. 2005; Laurent et al. 2007), thus leading to inadequate vaccination. Other disadvantages of Mantoux technique injection include inaccurately delivered dosage of vaccine, vaccine wastage in dead space of the needle, and variable injection success when using different gauge needles (Flynn et al. 1994). Moreover, success rate of ID injection by untrained personnel was found to be 80\u201390% (Howard et al. 1997). In an effort to reduce training requirements and to improve the reliability of the Mantoux injection technique, an intradermal adapter is under development by PATH (Seattle, WA, USA), a nonprofit, international health agency that develops and advances health technologies for low resource settings, and SID Technologies. This device fits over a conventional hypodermic needle and syringe and limits the angle and depth of penetration of the needle into the skin in order to facilitate delivery to the dermis.\n",

Additionally, using microneedles for ID immunization with split-viron vaccine (seasonal H1N1 strain) showed approximately ten-fold dose-sparing compared to IM immunization. In the same study, ID immunization using plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin protein of influenza A virus showed similar dose-sparing effects after multiple immunizations (Alarcon et al. 2007).

Microneedle ID vaccination showed slightly better response in the murine model than the other routes used, while all treatments in the rabbit had similar responses. A follow-up ID immunization was performed to compare ID injection with IM injection over a range of doses in a rabbit model: 10, 0.2, and 0.08 \u03bcg of anthrax vaccine (Mikszta et al. 2006). After prime immunization, ID injection showed significantly higher immunogenicity than IM injection when using 10 and 0.2 \u03bcg dosages. Interestingly, ID injection with 0.2 \u03bcg showed a statistically equivalent response to IM administration of the 10 \u03bcg dose. After administration of a booster immunization, this dose-sparing phenomenon continued. Furthermore, an aerosol lethal challenge with anthrax spores showed that a 10 \u03bcg ID injection completely protected the immunized rabbits, whereas IM injection of the same dose protected only 71% of the rabbits.",

It was found that in younger participants, ID immunization was not significantly different from immunization by IM, as shown by geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers. However, ID administration showed lower HAI titers than IM in elderly patients. Further evaluation of ID microneedle vaccination against influenza was performed in clinical studies of healthy adults (18\u201357 yrs) (Leroux-Roels et al. 2008; Beran et al. 2009) and elderly persons (>60 yrs) (Holland et al. 2008; Arnou et al. 2009).

ID immunization using 3 and 6 \u03bcg of hemagglutinin induced inferior immune response as shown by HAI titer, but a dose of 9 \u03bcg showed comparable response compared to full-dose (15 \u03bcg) IM vaccination (Beran et al. 2009). For elderly subjects (>60 years old), a booster vaccine (15 \u03bcg) was administered due to the inferior immune system generally found in the elderly compared to younger adults (Goodwin et al. 2006). Therefore, 15 \u03bcg of hemagglutinin was administered twice by either ID or IM routes in elderly subjects. In this phase II clinical trial, ID immunization showed significantly better immune response as determined by post-immunization GMT (geometric mean titer), seroprotection (% participants with HAI titers \u226540), GMTR (geometric mean ratio of post-immunization titer to pre-immunization titer), and rate of seroconversion (post-immunization titer in participants with a pre-immunization titer <10). Therefore, ID microneedle vaccination provided superior immunogenicity in a high priority population for protection from influenza due to high vulnerability (Holland et al. 2008). These findings were further confirmed in a phase III clinical trial for elderly persons (>60 years old), where ID immunization showed superior seroprotection, GMTR, and rate of seroconversion compared to IM after prime immunization. After administration of two booster immunizations, ID immunization induced consistently higher seroprotection rates than IM immunization (Arnou et al. 2009).",

In response to the risks of disease transmission due to cross contamination from reuse of injection devices, a new generation of jet injector designs were developed starting in the late 1980s to address this safety concern. These new jet injectors utilize a sterile, disposable cartridge or syringe for each patient injection and a reusable hand-piece that relies on a power source, such as a manually powered spring or gas canister. A number of disposable-syringe jet injectors (DSJIs) have been developed and approved by national regulatory authorities for a variety of applications and uses, including vaccine delivery. Some of these are low-cost, manually powered DSJI technologies, developed specifically for application to developing countries\u2019 immunization requirements and needs, which include design features to prevent reuse (\u2018auto-disable\u2019) of the needle-free syringes. DSJIs in clinical development for ID delivery include the Biojector\u00ae 2000 and Zetajet\u00ae (Bioject), and PharmaJet\u00ae (PharmaJet Inc.).",

Clinical studies have also been conducted with DNA vaccines for seasonal influenza to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. Results have been promising, but immune responses are not yet equivalent to standard vaccine delivery methods (Drape et al. 2006; Jones et al. 2009). EPI and PMED delivery of DNA vaccines for a variety of other diseases have also shown immunogenicity preclinically, including malaria, avian influenza, herpes simplex virus, HIV, non-small cell lung cancer, Eurasian encephalitic viruses, hantaviruses, SARS coronavirus, and smallpox (Weniger and Papania 2008).",

The use of this device is simple and does not require trained personnel (Baxby 2002; Weniger and Papania 2008). The needles are dipped into vaccine and then punctured perpendicularly into skin repeatedly over an area of about 5 mm diameter by a process called scarification (WHO 2010). Although this method was effective for the smallpox eradication program, poorly controlled dosing, inefficient use of vaccine and needle-stick injuries were significant shortcomings that have limited the use of bifurcated needles for other vaccines.",

Using this approach, vaccine forms a solid-state coating on the surface of solid microneedles that dissolves off within the skin upon application. Typically, this method provides a bolus delivery of a sub-milligram dose of antigen within minutes of application, which is often suitable for delivery of vaccines. An effective microneedle coating process typically involves dip-coating metal microneedles in a coating solution containing the vaccine, a surfactant to promote wetting of the microneedle surface, and a viscosity enhancer to increase coating thickness (Gill and Prausnitz 2007b; Gill and Prausnitz 2007a). Using this technique, compounds over a large range of sizes including small molecules, proteins, DNA, and virus particles have been coated onto microneedles. Novel coated microneedle designs for improved delivery have been demonstrated, such as the three-dimensional grooves-embedded microneedle (Han et al. 2009) and the pocketed microneedle (Gill and Prausnitz 2008). The first ID vaccination using coated microneedles delivered ovalbumin as a model protein antigen to hairless guinea pigs (Matriano et al. 2002; Widera et al. 2006). In these studies, ID microneedle vaccination showed a better immune response than an equivalent SC or IM injection at low dose. The investigators also found that immune response by microneedle vaccination was dose-dependent.\n",

Microneedles coated with 10 \u03bcg of seasonal influenza H1N1 inactivated virus vaccine induced complete protection against lethal virus infection in mice. However, subsequent studies showed that influenza vaccine lost more than 95% of its antigenicity during the coating process (Kim et al. 2010b). In order to maintain antigenicity, the disaccharide trehalose was added to the coating formulation to serve as a stabilizer. This enabled successful immunizations requiring smaller doses of vaccine (0.4 \u03bcg) as compared to immunizations with similar immune responses by conventional IM immunization (Kim et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2011). Coated microneedles also showed improved thermal stability of vaccine compared to the liquid form of vaccine (Kim et al. 2010b). More detailed studies showed that coated microneedle vaccination with inactivated influence virus vaccine induced similar antibody IgG response, HAI titer, and neutralizing activity as conventional IM immunization in mice (Kim et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2010b). To account for antigenic changes to the vaccine during the coating process, vaccine coated on microneedles was dissolved off the needles and then delivered IM by injection. In this case, vaccination using microneedles showed a better primary immune response than corresponding IM immunization using the same antigen formulation (Quan et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Vaccination by coated microneedles induced robust immunity to influenza after challenge in a mouse model (Kim et al. 2011). Notably, microneedle-immunized mice were shown to have undetectable levels of influenza virus titer in their lungs after challenge, unlike IM immunized mice, which had virus titers at least 100-fold higher. Additional assays for immune response from corresponding lung samples such as lung cytokine and lung IgG also consistently showed microneedle immunization to be superior to IM. As evidence for microneedle-enhanced immune system memory response, the microneedle immunized group was found to have significantly higher levels of total IgG and isotypes IgG1 and IgG2a post-challenge than pre-challenge, but antibody levels in IM immunized mice were lower post-challenge than pre-challenge (Kim et al. 2011). In addition to improved humoral immunity, coated microneedles also induced cellular recall response such as MHC II-associated CD4+ T helper cell response (Kim et al. 2009). Finally, microneedle immunization performed using a different strain of influenza (H3N2) virus vaccine induced similar complete protection against lethal challenge (Koutsonanos et al. 2009). Studies using virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine coated on microneedles were also performed. The VLP dose was controlled using a coating formulation including antigen concentration and a number of coating dips (Kim et al. 2010a). When a 0.35 \u03bcg dose of VLP was delivered, microneedle vaccination induced a stronger immune response than IM, as measured by IgG, IgG subtype (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b), HAI, neutralizing activity, lung IgG, lung cytokine, and more suppression of lung virus infection. Microneedle immunization by VLP showed complete protection from a lethal viral challenge without major body weight loss, unlike IM after the same dose, which partially protected mice from lethal viral infection (40%) and caused significant body weight loss (Quan et al. 2010).",

ID microneedle immunization with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in pigs using the PCPP coating formulation was superior in inducing antigen-specific IgG compared to ID injection by hypodermic needle with or without PCPP. Another study demonstrated effective generation of cellular immune responses to a hepatitis C DNA vaccine administered to mice using coated microneedles (Gill et al. 2010). Other studies have sought to specifically target delivery to antigen-presenting Langerhans cells using extremely short (~100 \u03bcm) needles that penetrate only into the epidermis. These short needles were coated using a novel coating process involving gas-jet drying (Chen et al. 2009). In an initial study, vaccination with ovalbumin-coated needles induced similar immune response to IM immunization. In a follow-up study, microneedles coated with a low dose of hemagglutinin-based influenza vaccine generated a similar immune response as IM vaccination at a 100-times larger dose. The authors proposed that these short, densely packed microneedles could deliver more than half of the antigen directly to antigen-presenting cells such as epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells (Fernando et al. 2010).",

Unlike non-dissolving (e.g., metal) microneedles coated with a vaccine formulation, dissolving microneedles are made solely of material such as polymers or sugars that will safely dissolve in the skin after insertion, which leaves behind only the microneedle patch backing. Typically, the vaccine is incorporated into the matrix of the microneedle and is released into the skin upon microneedle dissolution. Dissolving microneedles have been made using a number of different materials, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sullivan et al. 2008), maltose (Kolli and Banga 2008), carboxymethylcellulose (Lee et al. 2008), polylactic and/or polyglycolic acid (Park et al. 2005; Park et al. 2006) and dextrin (Ito et al. 2006). In a recent study, dissolving microneedles were prepared by encapsulating inactivated influenza vaccine in a polyvinylpyrrolidone matrix and used to immunize mice. The vaccine was gently encapsulated without significant damage to immunogenicity and was shown to generate similar antibody and cellular immune responses compared to IM injection of the same dose and provided complete protection against lethal challenge. Compared to IM injection, dissolving microneedle vaccination resulted in more efficient lung virus clearance and enhanced cellular recall responses after challenge (Sullivan et al. 2010). TheraJect has also developed biodegradable microneedles using carboxymethylcellulose containing various biomolecules including influenza vaccine (Oh et al. 2006).",

This method is attractive because the micro-scale pores made by microneedle insertion are generally too small for penetration of microorganisms (Donnelly et al. 2009), yet large enough for delivery of sub-unit and possibly viral vaccines. After insertion and removal of the microneedles, vaccine can be applied using a patch or other topical formulation for slow delivery by diffusion through long-lived pores (Kalluri and Banga 2011). This approach was investigated for transcutaneous vaccination using diphtheria toxoid and influenza vaccine (Ding et al. 2009a; Ding et al. 2009b). When diphtheria toxoid was applied to microneedle-pretreated skin in combination with cholera toxin adjuvant, a similar immune response was induced compared to SC injection. However, microneedle pretreatment did not enhance immune response for influenza vaccine. This vaccination approach has also been studied in an ex vivo human skin model to investigate skin immune cell responses (Ng et al. 2009). Using a related approach, blunt-tipped microneedles were used to scrape the skin, thereby making micro-troughs in the skin through which a DNA vaccine encoding HBsAg was administered (Mikszta et al. 2002). This approach generated stronger humoral and cellular immune responses than IM or ID injection.",

To overcome the slow processing of an immune response induced by DNA vaccination, DNA tattooing was suggested for short-interval DNA vaccination (Bins et al. 2005). In this study, it was shown that short-interval ID DNA tattoo immunization generated fast and stable T cell responses to human papillomavirus and complete protection from influenza virus challenge. When compared to the IM route, DNA tattoo vaccination elicited much stronger and quicker humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, studies indicated that even IM immunization with adjuvant was inferior to DNA tattoo immunization (Pokorna et al. 2009). To determine the effect of the tattooing process on DNA vaccine stability, the DNA topology change was evaluated, including critical factors for antigen expression and immune response (Quaak et al. 2009). It was found that the DNA tattooing tool had negligible effect on DNA structure and activity. Other vaccines including an adenoviral vector vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (Potthoff et al. 2009) and a peptide vaccine against human papillomavirus (Pokorna et al. 2009) were administrated by ID tattooing. In the case of the adenoviral vector vaccine, tattooing showed similar performance to ID injection. Tattooing of the peptide vaccine with CpG motifs adjuvant showed better response than IM vaccination with adjuvant.",

A comprehensive review on DNA tattooing can be found in one of the accompanying papers in this special volume on ID immunization (Oosterhuis et al. 2010).",

Skin abrasion using a razor and a toothbrush followed by application of adenoviral vectors has yielded promising results in humans (Van Kampen et al. 2005).",

For example, abrasion with emery paper, after skin hydration, has been shown to induce adequate penetration of anthrax vaccine (Matyas et al. 2004) and influenza virus vaccine (Guebre-Xabier et al. 2003), among others. This has led to the development of a Skin Prep System (SPS) to provide a controlled method of stratum corneum disruption for transcutaneous immunization currently under development by Intercell (Frerichs et al. 2008) (Fig. 4a). This technique has been shown to be effective in humans. Specifically, the skin was prepared by use of two mild strokes with the skin preparation device containing a mild abrasive affixed to a pressure-controlled device. The device was a single-use, disposable system and was discarded immediately after use. Following skin preparation, the patch containing vaccine against traveler\u2019s diarrhea (LT patch) was applied within the marked area and worn for 6 h at each vaccination, then removed and discarded by the participant. 59 LT-patch recipients were protected against moderate-to-severe diarrhea (protective efficacy of 75%) and severe diarrhea (protective efficacy of 84%). LT-patch recipients who became ill had shorter episodes of diarrhea (0.5 vs 2.1 days) with fewer loose stools than placebo (Frech et al. 2008). In another study, a similar technique was used to boost response against influenza vaccine. In this case, prior to application, the patch area was lightly abraded with ECG-grade emery paper on skin wetted with 10% glycerol/70% alcohol to disrupt the stratum corneum. In weeks following vaccination, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) responses in LT immunostimulatory patch recipients showed improvement over those receiving vaccine alone (Frech et al. 2005).\n",

            "text": "Ultrasound, especially at low frequencies, is very effective in permeabilizing the skin (Tezel et al. 2001). It is now understood that acoustic cavitation, which is formation, pulsation, and collapse of gaseous bubbles under the oscillating pressure field of ultrasound, is the principal mediator for ultrasound-induced enhanced skin permeability. Several studies have shown that during ultrasound exposure, transient cavitation is predominantly induced in the coupling medium (the liquid present between the ultrasound transducer and the skin) and is primarily responsible for skin permeabilization (Tang et al. 2002; Tezel et al. 2002; Tezel and Mitragotri 2003). An estimated 10 bubble collapses/s/cm2 in the form of symmetric collapses (generating shock waves) or asymmetric collapses (producing microjets) near the surface of the skin are sufficient to explain the experimentally-observed skin permeability enhancements by ultrasound-induced skin permeabilization. Ultrasound has been shown to enhance the delivery of vaccines into skin (Tezel et al. 2005). Studies performed in mice have shown that the immune response generated by ultrasonically delivered vaccine was about 10-fold greater compared with SC injection per unit dose of the vaccine that entered the skin (about 1% of the topically applied dose entered the skin) (Tezel et al. 2005). Compared to simple topical administration, ultrasound pretreatment showed increased vaccine delivery, thereby enabling sufficient vaccine to enter the skin to activate the immune response. Furthermore, application of ultrasound resulted in activation of Langerhans cells, the reasons behind which are not clear. In another study, it was shown that application of tetanus toxoid to skin pretreated with ultrasound generated anti-tetanus toxoid IgG and neutralizing antibody titers (Dahlan et al. 2009). Several parameters, including concentration of co-applied sodium dodecyl sulfate and ultrasound duty cycle, impacted the magnitude of antibody titers. The authors concluded that the main mechanism of ultrasound-assisted skin immunization involved factors in addition to enhancement of skin permeability to topically applied antigen.",

For vaccination, electroporation has been used to increase stratum corneum permeability and thereby enable vaccine entry into the skin. Electroporation has also been used to permeabilize cells within the skin and thereby drive, for example, DNA vaccines into epidermal and dermal cells (Fig. 4b). Electroporation has been well established as a tool for delivering molecules across the stratum corneum (Prausnitz et al. 1993) or across the cell membranes (Bilitewski et al. 2003). Many studies have focused on the use of electroporation for DNA vaccination. This is not surprising given the long history of use of electroporation for delivery of DNA into cells in vitro. However, many electroporation studies involve insertion of electrode needles into the skin. Some studies have demonstrated the use of electroporation for topical vaccine delivery (Zhao et al. 2006). In one study, electroporation has been found to stimulate the exodus of Langerhans cells from the skin, which is likely to have an adjuvant-like effect (Zhao et al. 2006). In this study, the efficacy of peptide delivery was found to be comparable to that of ID injected with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant. Further, the peptide-specific CTL response to the vaccine delivered by electroporation was equivalent to that delivered by ID injection.",

Studies have demonstrated that in vivo skin electroporation may be used to increase transgene expression relative to naked DNA injection (Drabick et al. 2001). Transfected cells were principally located in dermis and included adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and numerous mononuclear cells with dendritic processes in a porcine model. Transfected cells were also observed in lymph nodes draining electropermeabilized sites. A HBsAg-coding plasmid was used to test skin electroporation-mediated nucleic acid vaccination in a murine model. Applications for these findings include modulation of immune responses to pathogens, allergens, and tumor-associated antigens and the modification of tolerance. In another study, in vivo electroporation has shown protection against avian influenza in non-human primates (Laddy et al. 2009). A number of human clinical trials testing vaccination enhanced by electroporation are currently under way.",

This observation led to the study of chemical agents to enhance transport across skin. More than 300 chemicals have been studied for their ability to increase skin permeability (Karande et al. 2004). Chemical permeation enhancers are relatively inexpensive and easy to formulate, they offer flexibility in their design, are simple in application and allow the freedom of self-administration to the patient. Chemical enhancers comprise a wide variety of different chemical functional groups and facilitate drug transport across the skin by a variety of complex mechanisms. They can directly exert their effect on skin structure by acting on intercellular lipids or corneocytes. Chemical enhancers can extract lipids from the skin thereby creating diffusion pathways for transdermal permeation. Alternatively, they can partition themselves into the lipid bilayers thereby disrupting the highly ordered lipid lamellae and causing their fluidization. Chemical enhancers can also significantly increase skin transport of a drug by enhancing its thermodynamic activity in the formulation (Karande et al. 2005).",

This was achieved by designing formulations that possess the ability to enhance skin permeability as well as exhibit high adjuvanticity. The rational design of such multi-functional formulations from first principles requires in-depth knowledge of interactions between chemical enhancers and skin, which exist for a very limited pool of chemicals. Hence, combinatorial libraries of chemical mixtures were screened. Studies have shown that in a randomly selected population of chemical formulations, certain binary mixtures of chemicals are far more potent in permeabilizing the skin as compared to single chemicals (Karande et al. 2004). In vaccination studies, a third chemical was added with the goal of enhancing the ability to offer adjuvanticity. The lead chemical formulations were tested in mice using the model antigen ovalbumin. The formulations that exhibited high permeation and adjuvanticity potential in in vitro screening also induced high IgG titers in mice (Karande et al. 2009). In another study, penetration enhancers and immunomodulators oleic acid and retinoic acid were used to enhance transcutaneous immunization with inactivated influenza virus across tape-stripped skin (Skountzou et al. 2006). Pretreatment of mouse skin with oleic acid elicited increased levels of influenza virus-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies to levels equivalent to those induced by intra-nasal immunization with inactivated influenza virus. Oleic acid and retinoic acid treatments differentially affected the pattern of cytokine production upon stimulation with influenza viral antigen and provided enhanced protection.",

In this method, an array of micropores is created in the skin by removal of stratum corneum by the application of focused thermal energy based on resistive heating via the contact of electrically heated small-diameter wires to the skin surface (Bramson et al. 2003) (Fig. 4c) or other methods based on radiofrequency or laser-based approaches. In this study, the microporation tip was comprised of a set of 80 \u03bcm diameter tungsten wires with control circuitry allowing for precise control of the electrical current pulses that were passed through each wire. The software user interface was designed to enable the control of various microporation parameters including micropore density, resistive element temperature, current pulse width, number of pulses, pulses pacing, and contact pressure. The temperature of the tip that was placed in contact with the skin was calibrated by an optical calibrator device. The study showed that microporation significantly increased the penetration of topically delivered vaccine. Microporation enhanced expression of luciferase upon placement of adenovirus vectors by 100\u2013300-fold. The same procedure led to increased CTL response and increased IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells. In a related study, the same technology has been shown to deliver influenza vaccine into mouse skin. Eighty micropores were created in 1 cm2 area and the vaccine was placed on the porated skin. This procedure generated adequate protective response in mice (Garg et al. 2007).",

In contrast, some of the novel ID delivery methods, such as projectile delivery and tattoo guns, introduce new, sophisticated devices that require additional training of clinical personnel. Assuming the injection is done properly, the Mantoux technique can administer essentially all of the vaccine into the skin. Hollow microneedles and projectile delivery can be similarly efficient.

A number of new ID vaccination technologies have been successful in human clinical trials. ID vaccination using the BD hollow microneedle was approved in Europe in 2009 for ID administration of the Sanofi Pasteur seasonal influenza vaccine and was introduced in Australia and New Zealand during the 2010 influenza season (Holland et al. 2008; Beran et al. 2009). This microneedle device may be adapted for use to administer other vaccines as well. Jet injectors have a long history of use for vaccination and are receiving renewed attention for ID delivery of vaccines in clinical trials, especially to address developing countries\u2019 needs, through support from WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (see Sect. 3.1.2.).

            "text": "Other ID delivery devices are under advanced preclinical study. Solid coated microneedles have been the subject of numerous vaccination studies in mice and larger animals to administer influenza and other vaccines (see Sect. 5.2), and have been used in a Phase II clinical trial of a drug, parathyroid hormone (Cosman et al. 2009). Likewise, skin electroporation, in some cases in combination with microneedles, has been studied in animals for skin vaccination. As evidence for clinical feasibility, electroporation of skin for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to skin tumors is approved and used in Europe (Gehl 2008). Tattooing is of course in widespread human use, and its application to vaccination has been studied preclinically. Other methods to increase skin permeability, such as ultrasound, chemical enhancers and heat, are also in clinical use or trials for transdermal drug delivery applications (Prausnitz and Langer 2008), which compliment preclinical studies of their use for vaccination. Given the large number of technologies for ID vaccination under development, and the advanced clinical status of many of them, the future outlook for bringing ID vaccination into more widespread clinical practice appears encouraging. The optimal delivery method will depend on the specific application and other factors, such as immunologic response, logistical needs, and financial constraints.",
