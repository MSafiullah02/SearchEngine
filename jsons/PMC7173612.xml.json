Other viral pathogens associated with the common cold are the coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus (Monto and Cavallaro, 1971). Prematurely born infants and older children with asthma are particularly at risk of developing severe rhinovirus (RV) infections. RVs enter via the upper respiratory tract and bind to respiratory epithelial cells via several receptors, which are different, depending on the RV species. However, while once thought to cause relatively not so harmful upper respiratory tract illness, HRVs are now linked to increase in the severity of chronic pulmonary disease, asthma development (Kim and Gern, 2012) and, more recently, severe bronchiolitis in infants and children, as well as fatal pneumonia in elderly and immune compromised adults.",

As this class of polymerases is unique to RNA viruses and has no host counterpart, the viral RdRP represents a very attractive target for antiviral design. This biochemical activity is not present in mammalian cells; thus, very selective inhibitors could be designed that target only the virus without producing side effects. However, owing to the existence of more than 100 serotypes and variability at the antigenic site, efforts made at vaccine development are hindered. To date, specific drugs that prevent or reduce RV infection are not available. Thus, this opens a wide avenue to design novel \u201canti-rhinoviral\u201d drugs.\n",

HRV-C is a novel group discovered by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2009 (Lamson et al., 2006). Another classification is based on the nature of the receptor group utilized by the polymerase enzyme in infecting the host cell. Out of 100 distinct serotypes of RVs identified, 90% of these utilize ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecules) as a receptor for infecting HeLa cells and are thus referred to as the \u201cmajor\u201d receptor group (Tomassini and Colonno, 1986, Greve et al., 1989). All the remaining RV serotypes, with one exception, utilize the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor (Hofer et al., 1994) and are referred to as the \u201cminor\u201d receptor group. A systematic evaluation of a group of capsid-binding agents (15 compounds) against all serotyped HRV revealed the existence of two antiviral groups, A and B, based upon differential susceptibility to these antiviral compounds. HRV14 and poliovirus (PV) belong to group A, while HRV16 and HRVIA belong to group B (Andries et al., 1990).",

Also, HRV 3Dpol resembles most closely to PV 3Dpol enzyme (Hansen et al., 1997), except at the N terminus. Excluding PV residues 12\u201325, superposition of the two gives a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.14 \u00c5 for HRV14 (64% identity), 1.18 \u00c5 for HRV16 (56% identity), and 1.12 \u00c5 for HRV1B (57% identity), and that is why PV RdRP is sometimes considered while studying inhibitors for HRV RdRP. The complete view offered by HRV 3Dpol confirms a conservation of tertiary structure among RdRPs from diverse RNA viruses and that is why RdRPs is a very promising target for developing multitarget antiviral drugs having broad range of biological activity. Differences observed in the secondary structure of these polymerases reflect not only the substrate diversity but also divergent mechanisms for initiation of RNA synthesis (primer dependent for HRV and RHDV but primer independent for HCV and bacteriophage \u03c66). Three well-defined channels have been identified in the RdRP structures that allow access to the active site of the incoming ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTPs) and the RNA template, as well as the exit path of the newly synthesized daughter-strand RNA (dsRNA) product (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006).",

The N-terminal segment folds back on itself, forming a smaller loop (residues 41\u201353), which sits at the top of the polymerase molecule and forms contacts with the tip of the fingers subdomain. This N-terminal segment serves as a bridge reaching across to form interactions with the thumb domain. This bridging of the fingers and thumb subdomains is unique to RdRPs and gives them a globular shape rather than the U shape observed in the DNA polymerases, DdRPs, and the HIV RT.

Motif A also contains Asp239, which plays a key role in discriminating between ribonuleotides and 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleotides by hydrogen bonding to the 2\u2032-OH of NTP (Hansen et al., 1997). Motif B (residues 291\u2013308) includes most of the helix \u03b115, along with highly conserved Asn296, which forms hydrogen bonds to Asp239 and positions the latter for NTP recognition (Hansen et al., 1997). Motif C (residues 319\u2013334) contains Asp327, which, along with Asp234, are absolutely required for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction and are responsible for chelation of two magnesium ions at the active site.

The folding topology of the HVR1B thumb is similar to the RHDV enzyme, except that the latter lacks the short helix \u03b120. Structural differences are observed for HRV16 3Dpol compared to HRV1B, since it consists of three antiparallel \u03b1-helices followed by an extended loop segment which connects to an additional C terminal \u03b1-helix. The thumb subdomain of HRV16 3Dpol differs considerably from that of HCV, BVDV, and \u03c66 polymerases also. The larger thumb subdomain of HCV NS5B contains more than twice the number of residues as compared to HRV16 3Dpol and includes three additional \u03b1-helices and a \u03b2-loop structure. Unlike HCV, where the C-terminal helix fills the active site, the C-terminal helix of HRV16 3Dpol packs against the front faces of the molecule in such a way to leave the active site cavity largely exposed (Appleby et al., 2005).",

Intracellular accumulation of oligomeric polymerases was observed during viral infection of different RNA viruses, including PV, Sendai virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, and norovirus, among others. Within the crystal lattice of PV 3DPol, molecules interact through two extensive contact surfaces referred to as interfaces I and interfaces II (Hansen et al., 1997), giving rise to higher order structures that have been proposed to explain the oligomerization (Beckman and Kirkegaard, 1998). Disruption of contacts forming interfaces I in PV 3DPol crystals diminishes biochemically detected oligomerization. Of the three serotypes of HRVs (HRV14, 16, 1B) none forms crystal lattice contacts resembling interfaces II of PV. Furthermore, neither HRV16 nor HRV1B 3DPol show interactions found in interfaces I of PV. However, HRV14 3DPol contains an intermolecular contact similar to the interface I. However, the two salt bridges forming interface I in PV are not present in HRV14. It is important to note that the oligomerization phenomenon has not been reported till now for any HRV serotypes. Also, there is no current evidence which shows that oligomerization plays any role in HRV functioning (Pathak et al., 2002), but the study of the oligomerization phenomena in HRV polymerase can help in understanding the protein evolution and higher order complexity associated with it.",

Here in case of HRV 3DPol, this closed conformation is accomplished by interconnecting the fingers and thumb domains through the N-terminal portion of the protein and through several loops protruding from the fingers, named the fingertips, which completely encircle the active site of the enzyme. The closed-hand conformation stabilizes a relatively rigid unit. However, different structural data showed that the thumb domain can rotate a few degrees, relative to the fingers and palm, giving a more open conformation that is found to be the inactive form of the enzyme (Ng et al., 2002). The recent structure of HCV genotype 2a RdRP revealed an extreme case of this \u201copen\u201d conformation, in which the contact between the fingertips and thumb is partially disrupted (Biswal et al., 2005). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed by the Cameron laboratory on the various picornaviral polymerases including PV, HRV, Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Moustafa et al., 2011) and the results showed conserved patterns of flexibility. molecular dynamics (MD) studies showed that the largest flexibility was located at the fingers domain, whereas the lowest flexibility was concentrated in the palm. The conserved structural motifs involved in primer, template, and/or nucleotide binding (motifs A, D\u2013F) were all quite flexible, even those located in the palm domain. In contrast, the structural motifs whose primary role is to serve as ligands to the divalent cations required for nucleotidyl transfer (the portion of motif A harboring AspA, the \u03b1-helix of motif B containing AsnB and motif C) appeared to be much less flexible. All these dynamic elements could be modulated by external effectors, which appear to be effective allosteric inhibitors that could block or disturb the flexibility of these enzymes, ultimately reducing their catalytic function. Among all structural movements observed, motif B and the \u03b2-loop at its N-terminus in particular, came out to be the new potential druggable targets (Garriga et al., 2013).",

Conserved motif D and specifically the residue lysine in this motif plays the substitute role of the alpha helix in other RdRPs. Motif D plays an important role in nucleotide addition and maintaining the fidelity. The lysine residue acts as a general acid, it protonates the leaving pyrophosphate group during the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. This proton transfer reaction, as shown in Fig. 11.3\n, while not essential to catalysis, is found to enhance the rate of nucleotidyl transfer by 50- to 2000-fold (Castro et al., 2007, Castro et al., 2009). Mutation of the motif D lysine leads to a dramatic decrease in the nucleotidyl transfer rate and increases the fidelity of the polymerase reaction, hence controlling the diverse population of the virus (Vignuzzi et al., 2008).",

Motif D is a conserved structural feature in PV and RV RdRPs. Hence, the result obtained for PV could be extended to RV. In particular, binding of the correct nucleotide produces a large chemical shift change to residue Met354 in accordance with a conformational change in motif D, whereas incorrect nucleotide binding fails to produce such a large chemical shift with respect to residue Met354, suggesting that closed conformation of the enzyme is not reached when the incorrect nucleotide binds. Thus, binding of the incorrect nucleotide appears to perturb the position of motif D and shift the conformational equilibrium away from the closed conformation, which is essential for the active state, i.e., it shifts the equilibrium to the left in step 2 of the kinetic mechanism (Fig. 11.2) and hence acts as a parameter in the fidelity checkpoint (Yang et al., 2012).",

The higher efficiency of the poly (A) template as compared with poly (C) was mainly shown in the turnover rate of the nucleotide substrate where the kcat for UTP was about 11-fold greater than the kcat for GTP (guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate). GTP is a purine nucleoside triphosphate, whereas UTP is a pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate, both acting as substrates during RNA synthesis. This further suggests that the polymerase enzyme may be more processive on the poly (A) template compared with the poly (C) template. On the other hand, the Km for GTP is 17-fold lower than that of UTP, suggesting that the number of hydrogen bonds involved in base pairing with the complementary nucleotide on the template may also contribute to efficient binding of the nucleotide substrate to the polymerase complex, where GTP can form three hydrogen bonds whereas UTP forms only two hydrogen bonds.",

The first phosphodiester bond is formed between D1 and D2. The initiation nucleotide (essentially a one-nucleotide primer) provides the 3\u2032-OH for the addition of the next nucleotide. De novo RNA synthesis is advantageous over the primer dependent one, since no genetic information is lost during replication and no additional enzymes are needed to generate the primer or to cleave the region between the template and the newly synthesized daughter RNA. In most cases, the productive de novo initiation event is immediately followed by elongation.

At moderate temperatures, the enzyme predominantly uses de novo initiation, whereas back priming dominates at elevated temperatures (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001). Based on these results and the observed structural differences between the PV and HCV RdRP, a steric model for dengue RdRP was suggested, where it can exist in either a closed or an open conformation, wherein the open one is favored at higher temperatures. The open conformation binds to a fold-back structure at the 3\u2032 terminus of the template with the subsequent elongation producing a dimerized product. Conversely, the closed conformation, favored at lower temperatures, recognizes the single-stranded 3\u2032 terminus of the template and initiates de novo synthesis.

In case of PV EC structure, we only observe 2\u20134 base pairs of the downstream helix with sufficient density to allow for model building. The PV structure shows that the downstream helix is rotated by <180 degree such that the 5\u02b9 end of the helix is closer to the thumb domain than the fingers domain, whereas no such rotation is observed in case of RV. On the downstream template side, there is a conserved binding pocket for the +2 nucleotide and this anchoring interaction probably acts in concert with the upstream clamp to establish the high temporal stability of the ECs. The EC features an upstream RNA duplex that is pinched between the pinky finger and thumb domains such that the RNA exit channel is opened by nearly 4 \u00c5 as compared to the polymerase alone structures.

However, no structures of translocation intermediates are currently available for any RdRPs and the precise mechanism is not yet known. Once a stable polymerase\u2013nucleic acid complex is formed, the polymerases can add thousands of nucleotides during elongation. High elongation processivity requires a stable association of template and primer in the polymerase, which prevents dissociation, but which should also be nonspecific and weak enough to facilitate the translocation movement upon each nucleotidyl transfer reaction step.

VPg, 3Dpol, poly (A), and UTP form a complex that allows transfer of UMP to the hydroxyl group of residue Y3 of VPg (Fig. 11.6\n). Although the exact molecular mechanism of VPg uridylyation by HRV 3D polymerase is not known, a few structural aspects are known by correlating with PV polymerase. Using the crystal structure of HRV16 3D polymerase, a front loading mechanism has been proposed for the uridylyation (Appleby et al., 2005). In the complex, the polymerase binds directly to VPg and utilizes a stem-loop cis-acting replication element (CRE) as a template to uridylylate the tyrosine residue of VPg protein. This product, VPg-pU, is subsequently extended by at least one more uridine nucleotide to give VPg-pUpU. Residues: Gly376, Arg378, and Thr390 in HRV16 3DPol map to the backside of the polymerase molecule at the junction between the palm and thumb subdomains and are believed to be essential for the efficient binding of 3AB (precursor of VPg) and uridylylation of VPg.",

In vivo analysis showed that the inhibitor targeted the activity of RNA polymerase (3DPol).

In the case of RV, Quercetin interferes with the processing of RV polyprotein by RV proteases and this process is required for activation of RNA polymerase (3DPol). Results demonstrated that quercetin significantly reduced both negative- and positive-strand vRNA and it is due to reduced cleavage of eIFG4II and reduction in viral capsid protein, VP2, suggesting that quercetin actually targets the initial polypeptide processing that in turn is required for both vRNA polymerase processing and for cleavage of eIFG4II. Another possibility could be that it may directly inhibit vRNA polymerase, thereby blocking genome translation and synthesis of new progeny virus (Ganesan et al., 2012).",

PDTC is effective against all tested HRV serotypes in several cell lines analyzed, without being toxic (Gaudernak et al., 2002). In a study performed by Krenn and coworkers, the data indicated that PDTC hampers the processing of the HRV polyprotein, thus targeting the enzyme viral proteases 2APro and/or 3CPro (Krenn et al., 2005). PDTC also chelates various metal ions, leading to the formation of lipophilic dithiocarbamate\u2013metal complexes (Thorn and Ludwig, 1962) and can thus promote cell entry of metals, e.g., diethyldithiocarbamate in the form of these lipophilic metal complexes. PDTC is found to increase the intracellular copper levels in thymocytes (Erl et al., 2000). Kim et al. (1999) demonstrated that PDTC can also increase the uptake of zinc ions, and it is known that zinc ion inhibits the activity of the 3DPol of HRV16 in vitro (Hung et al., 2002). Thus, it cannot be ruled out that apart from targeting protease enzyme, PDTC could also target the RNA polymerase enzyme (3DPol) function by increasing the intracellular zinc ion concentration (Krenn et al., 2005).",

It showed specific activity against all three influenza A, B, and C (Furuta et al., 2013). It also inhibited the RV replication in HeLa cells, with an EC50 of 29 \u00b5g/mL (Furuta et al., 2002). Analysis showed that the primary mechanism of action of favipiravir against the influenza virus was specific inhibition of vRNA polymerase (Furuta et al., 2005). It is predicted that a similar mechanism might occur with other viruses, such as PV and RV, inhibited by favipiravir, which may account for its broad-spectrum inhibition. Mechanistic studies show that the favipiravir and its form favipiravir-RMP (favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-50-monophosphate) do not inhibit influenza RNA polymerase activity, but it is the phosphoribosylated form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-50-triphosphate (RTP) that inhibits the enzyme. Metabolism of favipiravir to its triphosphate form occurs in an extracellular environment in a concentration-dependent manner. The vRNA polymerase mistakenly recognizes favipiravir-RTP as a purine nucleotide. This favipiravir-RTP is misincorporated in nascent vRNA, or it may act by binding to conserved polymerase domains, preventing incorporation of nucleotides for vRNA replication and transcription (Jin et al., 2013).",

Crystal structures of the serotypes HRV1B, 14, and 16 have been recently determined. Not all serotypes have been studied extensively and an immense scope is still left for such crystallographic studies. RNA polymerase performs the dual function of RNA replication and uridylation of VPg. The mechanism of this uridylation process is still not fully understood. Also, various steps of replication processes are only modeled based on the PV and HIV-RT 3DPol. Very little information is known about the termination step. These gaps need to be filled with further advancements using the techniques previously reported for other viruses of the Picornaviridae family. The more advance picture of the enzyme can help in bringing more specific antirhinoviral drugs. Currently no drug targeting the RV polymerase is approved to be clinically used to treat RV infection. Hence, drug design targeting this enzyme needs more attention of both experimental and theoretical chemists. Hopefully, this chapter may provide some guidelines in this direction.",
