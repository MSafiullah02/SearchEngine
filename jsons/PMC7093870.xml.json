Higher doses and longer duration of therapy may be appropriate in this setting. Experience to date suggests that treatment in critically ill patients should be continued for at least 10 days, unless there is conclusive evidence that viral replication has ceased.17 Resistance of novel 2009 H1N1 influenza to oseltamivir has been reported, especially in immunocompromised patients. This has been attributed to the H275Y mutation that confers resistance to oseltamivir. Resistant H1N1 isolates have so far been susceptible to zanamivir.23 Peramivir is an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor that received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for hospitalized patients in whom other available methods of treatment are ineffective or unavailable. Peramivir is currently the only intravenous antiviral for treating the novel H1N1 influenza. However, it is not recommended in cases of oseltamivir resistance.24\n",

Several case series have documented good clinical outcomes associated with the use of ECMO. Most recently, the Australia and New Zealand ECMO Influenza Investigators reported excellent outcomes in a series of patients with H1N1-associated ARDS.9 However, to date, only 2 prospective, randomized clinical trials have been reported. The first by Zapol et al55 did not demonstrate survival benefit in a cohort of patients with various causes of acute respiratory failure. More recently, Peek et al56 reported the results of the United Kingdom National Health Services Trial (CESAR trial). This study randomized 180 adults with severe ARDS to receive either conventional mechanical ventilation in a community hospital or ECMO in a tertiary referral center. An intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated better clinical outcomes in the group referred for ECMO. Among patients referred for ECMO, who actually received ECMO, mortality was only 37%. However, among patients referred for ECMO but who received lung-protective mechanical ventilation instead, mortality was even lower at 18%. In summary, available data do not provide a compelling rationale for the use of ECMO in severe ARDS at this time.",

            "text": "The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids in ARDS is founded on the fact that they have broad antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects. A prospective randomized crossover trial of 91 patients with severe, early ARDS suggested that methylprednisolone infusion (1 mg/kg/d) reduced lung injury scores, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome scores, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU mortality.57 Furthermore, treated patients had a lower rate of secondary bacterial infections. Unfortunately, this study was limited by its crossover design. Use of steroids as a rescue therapy late in the course of ARDS was investigated in 180 patients in another randomized controlled trial called the Late Steroid Rescue Study. Steroids did not show any survival benefit when treatment was initiated 7 or more days after the onset of ARDS.58 Although observational studies of patients with ALI caused by H1N1 have reported good clinical outcomes with a combination of oseltamivir with methylprednisolone, controlled data are lacking.2 On the basis of the failure of steroids to benefit patients with ARDS caused by other viral etiologies, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1, Hantavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, the above data fail to produce a convincing argument for their use in H1N1-associated ARDS.59\n",
