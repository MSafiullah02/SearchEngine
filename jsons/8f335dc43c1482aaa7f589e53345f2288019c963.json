Vaccination of mice with recombinant S450-650 (rS450-650) can induce Abs against SARS-CoV, although the titer is relatively low. In the present study, a fusion protein linking a fragment (residues 39-272) of murine calreticulin (CRT) to S450-650 in a prokaryotic expression system was created. Compared with target antigen alone, the recombinant fusion product (rS450-650-CRT) has much improved hydrophilicity and immunogenicity. The S450-650-specific IgG Abs of BALB/c mice subcutaneously immunized with rS450-650-CRT were in substantially higher titer (approximately fivefold more).

It is one of the key molecular chaperones in the ER as well as a homeostatic controller of amounts of cytosolic and ER calcium. Additionally, CRT is recognized to be one of the heat shock proteins that have potent immunobiological activity (11) . We have recently shown that a recombinant fragment of murine CRT (rCRT/39-272) covering its partial N and P domains is a potent activator of B cells and macrophages via the Toll like receptor-4 and CD14 pathway (12) . When fused to EGFP, CRT/39-272 greatly improves humoral responses against EGFP in both BALB/c and T cell deficient nude mice (12) . By using DNA vaccines encoding fusion proteins between CRT and target antigens such as tumor antigen E7, N protein of SARS-CoV and Bacillus anthracis protective antigen domain IV, previous investigators have also observed that CRT can function as a molecular adjuvant (13) (14) (15) (16) . In the present study, we prepared a soluble recombinant fusion protein (rS450-650-CRT) between S450-650 and CRT/39-272 and observed that it has much better immunogenicity than rS450-650 alone.",

Figure 2 shows that the fusion protein was by far the most effective immunogen for inducing S450-650-specific IgG responses in BALB/c mice. More detailed analysis on the IgG Abs thus produced was then carried out. Serum samples from BALB/c mice (five per group) 28 days post s.c. immunization with rS450-650, rCRT/39-272 or rS450-650-CRT (30 \u03bcg/mouse) were assayed by ELISAs.

After all, adjuvants are typically characterized by their ability to activate professional APCs, such as DCs and macrophages, rather than B or T cells. or LPS, or rEGFP for 24 hrs and then analyzed by flow cytometry for CD40 expression, which is regarded as a marker for DC maturation (17) . As illustrated in Figure 5 , the percentage of CD40 + cells of the groups treated with rCRT/39-272 (24.5%) or rS450-650-CRT (18.6%) was considerably higher than that of the rEGFP control group (6.8%), thus confirming rCRT/39-272 and rS450-650-CRT as potent activators of murine DCs. This is further supported by the fact that rS450-650-CRT as well as rCRT/39-272, but not rEGFP, were able to induce production of IL-12 and IL-1\u03b2 by DCs in vitro (data not shown). The ability of rCRT/39-272 and rS450-650-CRT to activate DC is not due to endotoxin contamination because the recombinant proteins used in this study were passed through polymyxin B agarose to remove endogenous LPS that could have come from the E. coli system.",

            "text": "Although our previous work showed that rCRT/39-272 is able to activate B cells and macrophages in vitro (12) , data on DC activation by rCRT/39-272 and rCRT-S450-650 allows a more panoramic view of the molecular mechanisms underlying the extraordinary adjuvanticity of this prokaryotically expressed soluble calreticulin fragment. It is also of importance to mention that, in addition to its stimulatory effects on B cells and DCs, rCRT/39-272 can also induce CD4 helper T cell responses in mice. In a previous study using draining lymph node cells from BALB/c mice after s.c. immunization with rCRT/39-272, we were able to establish highly sensitive CRT-specific CD4 + helper T cell lines (manuscript in preparation). Based upon the above observation, we propose that recombinant CRT may function as a molecular adjuvant through several different pathways that may result in synergistic effect in vivo. Firstly, APCs are known to express different receptors (e.g. CD14 and CD91) for CRT (18) (19) (20) (21) ; this would facilitate more efficient capture and uptake of CRT-linked antigens. Secondly, soluble CRT directly activates DCs (Fig. 5 ) and macrophages (12) , thereby leading to more efficient antigen processing and presentation. Thirdly, CRT in fusion proteins functions as a carrier protein and activates CD4 + helper T cells that are capable of providing cognate help for antigen-specific B cells. Finally, the CRT portion of the fusion protein directly activates B cells and triggers their IgG class switching even in the absence of T cell help (Ref. 12 and Fig. 4 ). The genomes of many viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV and influenza viruses) undergo substantial mutation, which can diminish T cell epitopes in the viral proteins, resulting in escape of the virus from immune detection by T lymphocytes (22) (23) (24) . In this scenario, the ability of vaccines to induce IgG responses in hosts deficient in cognate helper T cells can be valuable.",

Previous investigators have observed increased concentrations of CRT-specific serum IgG Abs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (25, 26) . However, it is unclear whether such Abs participate in the pathological damage to the host or function as part of the immunoregulatory network. When rCRT/39-272 was employed to immunize different strains of mice, rats and rabbits, with or without Freund's adjuvant, high titer IgG Abs were obtained in these animals with no accompanying signs of autoimmune disorders (data not shown). In one experiment, BALB/c mice remained healthy for 6 months after four doses of s.c. immunization with rCRT/39-272 (data not shown), arguing against the possibility that recombinant CRT causes autoimmune damage in vivo.",

Park and coworkers prepared a DNA vaccine encoding a fusion protein between CRT and Bacillus anthracis protective antigen domain IV and showed that it much enhanced antibody responses to the target Ag (15) . Kim and colleagues also demonstrated that a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to the N protein of the SARS-CoV is capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and cellular immunity (16) . It should be noted, however, that proteins expressed by DNA vaccines may be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi after synthesis, thus limiting their ability to induce an antibody response. Moreover, intracellularly expressed CRT may not be as efficient as soluble extracellular CRT in exerting APC conditioning and in activating B cells in vivo.",
