Cheetahs, whose genome has become more homozygous with minimal allelic diversity due to an evolutionary bottleneck, have a very high prevalence of FIP (O'Brien et al 1985). Similarly, the increased prevalence we found in some purebreed varieties could be due to a concentration of inherited factors through in-breeding or small founder populations. Given a common environment and viral strain, Foley and Pedersen (1995) calculated that slightly greater than 50% of FIP susceptibility in purebreed cats from six catteries could be attributed to inherited differences between individuals. Interestingly, in this study one of the catteries with numerous closely related FIP-affected cats was a Birman cattery (Foley and Pedersen 1995). Birmans were by far the most commonly affected in the study reported here, and therefore we may not be the first to provide evidence of an increase in susceptibility to FIP in this breed.",

            "text": "Other investigators have questioned whether the increased prevalence of FIP in purebreed cats may actually be due to confounding factors. Purebreed cats are more likely to be raised in catteries, which may be inherently more stressful because of the multi-cat environment, regular introduction of new cats, and frequent breeding (Kass and Dent, 1995, Pedersen, 1995). Additionally, cattery cats presumptively have greater exposure to feline enteric coronavirus (a requirement for development of FIP) due to increased population density (Foley et al., 1997a, Foley et al., 1997b, McReynolds and Macy, 1997). Finally, the possible increased willingness of owners of expensive purebreed cats to pursue advanced diagnostics and supportive treatment at a referral veterinary facility such as the NCSU-VTH may skew the apparent prevalence of disease. However, these factors would be expected to falsely increase the prevalence of FIP in all purebreed cats and not just those breeds we report to be at increased risk of disease development.",

We doubt that the absence of cats diagnosed with FIP in 23 breeds indicates an absolute resistance to disease, although it is possible that some of these breeds (such as Maine Coon cats, which were seen at the NCSU-VTH in relatively larger numbers) possess unrecognized protective factors that influence susceptibility.
