            "text": "\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is now known to be a common malady even though it was first recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity less than 150 years ago.1 The lack of clear medical reports before the early 1800s is sometimes interpreted as evidence that MS is a relatively new disease. However, it is more likely that the evolution of medicine into science led to more precise observation and description of human diseases, including MS. Saint Lidwina of Schiedam (1380\u20131433) developed a relapsing neurological disorder at the age of 18 and may be the first case of clinically described MS.2 Ollivier was the first to report a clinical case in the medical literature in 1824.1 Shortly thereafter, Carswell illustrated a case of what is now clearly recognizable as MS in his atlas of anatomical pathology. Cruveilhier published gross pathological and clinical descriptions of MS. Vulpian first suggested the rubric of \u201csclerose en plaque\u201d in 1866. Charcot was primarily responsible for establishing MS as a unique and recognizable syndrome.3 He also described the clinical spectrum and the histological appearance. Pierre Marie was the first to suggest an infectious cause of MS in 1884, a hypothesis that is still debated. Toxins were also considered to be responsible in the early 1900s. A major advance toward the understanding of demyelinating diseases was the discovery of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) by Rivers in 1935.4 A variety of different demyelinating diseases have subsequently been described (Table 48\u20101\n).",

Peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin is formed by the extension of Schwann cells, and central nervous system (CNS) myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes. The myelin coating is interrupted at regular intervals (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon membrane with its concentration of voltage\u2010gated sodium channels is exposed to the extracellular environment (Fig. 48\u20101\n).5 The presence of myelin is essential to maintain conduction velocity; its loss or damage can lead to significantly slower conduction or conduction block. Other factors affect conduction velocity including certain antibodies and chemicals like nitric oxide. In certain cases, blockade may be the initial event in the cascade of events leading to demyelination.",

Schwann cells myelinate only one internodal segment from a single PNS axon, whereas oligodendrocytes myelinate multiple CNS axons. The proteins also differ. Proteolipid protein (PLP) accounts for approximately 50% of the CNS myelin proteins. Mutations in this highly conserved protein cause Pelizaeus\u2010Merzbacher disease. Protein zero is the major PNS myelin protein and performs a function similar to PLP in compacting the intraperiod line. Myelin basic protein (MBP) makes up 30% of CNS and 10% of PNS myelin proteins. MBP is not an integral protein but binds to the cytoplasmic surface and is responsible for compaction at the major dense line. Myelin associate glycoprotein accounts for about 1% of both peripheral and central myelin. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase are minor constituents of CNS myelin and are not found in the PNS.

            "text": "\nDuring ontogenesis, autoreactive lymphocytes normally undergo clonal depletion, but some escape and are merely suppressed, becoming tolerant to their antigens. Low levels of autoreactive T and B cells persist even in normal individuals. Autoimmune disorders occur when the tolerance of these cells toward their antigen is broken. The decreased suppressor activity of circulating lymphocytes from patients with MS and other presumed autoimmune diseases may reflect loss of tolerance.6 One potential mechanism that may break tolerance is molecular mimicry between self and foreign antigens. Autoreactive T4 lymphocytes may become activated on exposure to structurally similar foreign antigens. Some evidence suggests that molecular mimicry is relevant in MS. Not only do several viral and bacterial peptides share structural similarities with MBP, but it has also been demonstrated that these antigens may activate MBP\u2010specific T\u2010cell clones derived from MS patients.7 Blood\u2010brain barrier leakage alone may break tolerance because it gives CNS\u2010reactive lymphocytes easy access to otherwise inaccessible antigens. Alternatively, a primary event such as an infection or injury may release CNS antigens into the periphery, where they may activate corresponding autoreactive cells.8 The major support for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of MS is by analogy to EAE, the major animal model for MS. EAE is, however, an artificial situation and there is no spontaneous autoimmune animal model of MS. While EAE is the most commonly studied model of MS, several features of human MS can not be adequately captured by this model.9, 10 Over a hundred different effective treatments have been described for EAE; however, almost all of them are ineffective and some are harmful in human MS. A recent editorial discusses the merits and important limitations of EAE as a model for MS.10 In EAE, just like in classic human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis, the main target antigens are known. However, despite the discovery of several \u201cweak\u201d antigens in human MS, no dominant antigens have been identified to date. The only human demyelinating disease with an identified specific antigen is Devic's disease (neuromyelitis optica), which appears to be a novel autoimmune chanellopathy with an antigen that is neither neuronal nor myelin related (see later discussion of Devic's syndrome under Neuromyelitis Optica).11\n",

Several viral infections are known to cause demyelination in animals, including visna virus of goats and sheep, canine distemper virus, and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Viral infections in humans can also cause demyelination (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [JC papillomavirus], subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [measles virus], and human T\u2010cell lymphotropic or leukemia virus type 1 [HTLV\u20101]\u2010associated myelopathy). The epidemiology of MS suggests that environmental factors may promote the disease state, possibly due to one or more viruses. A virus may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS in several ways:1\nTransient or persistent infection outside the CNS may activate autoreactive T cells by means of molecular mimicry or by other nonspecific means (as superantigens do).2\nTransient CNS infection may initiate a cascade of events that fosters autoimmunity (breach the blood\u2010brain barrier, release CNS antigens).3\nRecurrent CNS infections may precipitate repeated inflammation and demyelination.4\nPersistent CNS viral infection could either incite inflammatory reactions detrimental to oligodendrocytes or directly injure them.\n",

Early serological studies are difficult to interpret because of nonspecific immune activation and resulting elevation of titers to many different viruses. Many MS patients have elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) titers to measles and herpes simplex (HSV) viruses, but this finding appears nonspecific. Virus has rarely been cultured from CSF of MS patients, but a new strain of HSV (the MS strain) and a new virus (Inoue\u2010Melnick virus) were first isolated from the CSF of MS patients.12, 13 Newer molecular techniques to search for a viral genome in CSF and brain have rejected the claim that HTLV\u20101 is associated with MS. The finding that human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), although present in 70% of brains from both control subjects and MS patients, is localized to the oligodendrocyte nuclei near plaques of MS patients and to oligodendrocyte cytoplasm in control subjects indicates that persistent CNS viral infection is common.14 This raises the possibility that MS may depend on an aberrant host response to this normal condition or that a defective virus that lacks the ability to evade immune detection may be to blame.",

A classification system of gray matter plaques was proposed by Peterson and associates18 They described three patterns of cortical demyelination: type I lesions are contiguous with subcortical white matter lesions; type II lesions are confined to the cortex, and are often perivascular; type III lesions extend from the pial surface to cortical layer 3 or 4. Besides cortical gray matter involvement, there is also evidence for prominent basal ganglia involvement, which can be seen in the early stages of MS, and may correlate better with motor outcome and cognitive measures than measures of white matter involvement.",

Cortical demyelination and diffuse axonal injury in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were reported as hallmarks of progressive forms of MS. Cortical demyelination was mainly seen in the subpial layer of cortex, and was associated with significant inflammatory infiltrates in the surrounding meninges. Diffuse inflammation was also found throughout the white matter of the progressive cases, associated with activation of microglia. No significant correlation was shown between focal white matter lesion load and cortical demyelination. This study defines three crucially important pathological hallmarks of MS\u2014focal demyelinated white matter lesions, diffuse injury in the white matter, and cortical plaque formation\u2014and concludes that white matter lesion formation predominates in active forms of MS, while cortical pathology and diffuse white matter injury characterizes the progressive forms.

Though its link to MS is well established, the risk conferred by this haplotype is small (relative risk of 3 to 4), and it is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of MS. Linkage to this locus has not been proved, indicating that it plays only a minor role in familial susceptibility. Other susceptibility genes likely contribute, possibly the T\u2010cell receptor variable \u03b2 region and the IgG heavy\u2010chain variable region (especially the VH2\u20135 gene). But their specific roles have not been established. Other genes under study have been the MBP coding gene, the CTLA\u20104 gene on chromosome 2q33, and the interleukin\u20101ra associated gene, in concurrence with the HLA\u2010DR15 haplotype. Mitochondrial mutations are also under investigation, and an LHON\u2010associated mtDNA mutation may be an important cofactor in developing MS in some patients. The ApoE4 gene, as in Alzheimer's disease, has been associated with a higher incidence of MS. On the other hand, ApoE3 is considered to have neurotropic, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties.

The more distinctive sensory relapses of MS consist of the sensory cord syndrome and the sensory useless hand syndrome. A common scenario is that of numbness or tingling beginning in one foot, ascending first ipsilaterally and then contralaterally. The sensory symptoms may ascend to the trunk, producing a sensory level, or may involve the upper extremities. Associated symptoms commonly include poor balance, weakness, urinary urgency, constipation, and Lhermitte's sign (see later). Brown\u2010S\u00e9quard syndrome may occur with sensory disassociation and hemiparesis. The sensory cord syndrome reflects an evolving demyelinating lesion that begins in the medial posterior column ipsilateral to the first symptoms. Sensory cord syndromes are common in MS and suggest the diagnosis when they occur in young persons and remit spontaneously or in response to corticosteroids. Patients with the sensory useless hand may note subjective numbness and lose discriminatory and proprioceptive function, resulting in difficulty writing, typing, buttoning clothes, and holding onto objects, especially when not looking at the hand. This problem can occur bilaterally even without lower extremity symptoms. The responsible lesion is in the lemniscal pathways either in the cervical spinal cord or in the brain stem.

Muscle atrophy is usually due to disuse, but lesions of lower motor neuron fibers or of the anterior horn itself can cause a pseudoradiculopathy with segmental weakness, atrophy, and diminished reflexes. Motor symptoms are presenting manifestations of MS in 32% to 41% of all cases; their prevalence is higher than 60% in long\u2010standing MS.",

The most common manifestation is visual loss in one eye that evolves over a few days. Periocular pain, especially with eye movement, usually accompanies and may precede the visual symptoms. Bilateral simultaneous ON is uncommon in adults, but formal visual field testing reveals unexpected defects in the clinically normal eye in a substantial number of patients. Children and Asian patients are more likely to have bilateral simultaneous ON; it may also be seen in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients. Examination shows an afferent pupillary defect, diminished visual acuity, subdued color perception, and often a central scotoma (Video 200, Afferent Pupillary Defect). Funduscopic examination is usually normal but occasionally will reveal papillitis (more common in children) or venous sheathing. Most patients begin to recover within 2 weeks, and significant visual recovery is common. There may be persistent visual blurring, altered color perception, or Uhtoff's sign. MS patients without a clinical history of ON often have evidence of optic nerve involvement on funduscopic examination or visual evoked potentials. Recurrent optic neuritis can occasionally be seen without evidence for dissemination to other areas of the CNS. A retrospective study of 72 cases with recurrent ON concluded that the 5\u2010year conversion rate to neuromyelitis optica was 12.5%; conversion rate to MS was 14.4%; while 73% did not convert to either condition. Patients with frequent and severe ON events in the first 2 years were more likely to convert to NMO; they also had a higher likelihood for significant persistent vision loss.30\n",

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia, caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, is the most common cause of diplopia in MS patients (Video 200, Afferent Pupillary Defect). When symptomatic, it produces horizontal diplopia on lateral gaze that usually remits. Examination discloses incomplete or slow adduction of the eye ipsilateral to the lesion and nystagmus of the contralateral eye during abduction (see Chapter 9).

Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia is strongly suggestive of MS, although this rarely may occur with tumor, infarct, mitochondrial cytopathy, Wernicke's encephalitis, and Chiari malformation (Video 229, Wernicke's Encephalopathy). Vertical and diagonal diplopia usually results from skew deviation.

Tonic spasms (paroxysmal dystonia) most often affect the arm and leg on one side, but the face, one limb, or bilateral limbs are sometimes involved (Video 20, Tonic Spasms).

Intense pain and ipsilateral or crossed sensory symptoms may accompany them. Paroxysmal weakness occurs, but it is uncommon. A wide variety of paroxysmal sensory symptoms may occur with MS, including tingling, prickling, burning, or itching, and sharp neuralgic pain is common.

The temporal course of MS can be described by one of four categories: relapsing\u2010remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP), and progressive relapsing (PR).32 Many physicians use the term relapsing progressive, which encompassed patients with SPMS, PRMS, and even those with RRMS who have stepwise relapse\u2010related worsening disability. This term has recently been abandoned. Other terms that relate to the course of MS but have no consensus regarding their definition are sometimes encountered. Benign MS generally refers to patients who have had MS for a long time but have little or no disability. Malignant MS is sometimes used to describe patients with frequent relapses and incomplete recovery but is also used in reference to patients with acute fulminant demyelinating syndromes (see later). The term clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to patients presenting with their first episode of region\u2010restricted episodes of CNS inflammatory demyelination. This may remain an isolated syndrome (no recurrence), it may remain a forme fruste of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or it may be the harbinger for one of the relapsing forms of MS. The probability of recurrent demyelinating episodes (e.g., clinically definite MS) has been the subject of several important investigations, and several clinical features and test results are of predictive value. Optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain stem are the most common sites of these recurrent monosymptomatic events, and the time profile follows that of MS relapses. The pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features, associated disorders, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management are the same as in MS.",

Profound visual loss, recurrent ON, and age older than 35 are associated with a higher risk for poor recovery. Investigators have concluded that recurrent multifocal demyelinating episodes, fulfilling the diagnostic requirements of clinically definite MS, develop in 50% or more of patients after isolated ON when follow\u2010up is extended beyond 20 years.36 Most of this risk is incurred within the first few years, although significant risk may continue into the fourth decade after the event. Children much more often develop simultaneous bilateral ON and have a lower risk for subsequent MS than adults. Factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing MS as a disseminated illness are the presence of venous sheathing, recurrent ON, family history of MS, white race, previous vague or nonspecific neurological symptoms, and the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs), elevated IgG index, or IgG synthesis rate in CSF. The severity of acute transverse myelitis is inversely related to the risk of acquiring further symptomatic demyelinating lesions. Complete transverse myelitis with profound loss of motor, sensory, and sphincter function imparts a relatively low risk of 3 to 14 for the later diagnosis of MS. Partial transverse myelitis with preservation of significant motor function at peak is associated with a much higher incidence of MS. Although monosymptomatic brain stem demyelination is not as common as either ON or acute transverse myelitis, similar conclusions have been reached. In the only study available, two thirds of these patients with cerebral white matter lesions detected on MRI developed MS within 5 years, compared with none of 5 patients with normal head MRI.37, 38\n",

Metastatic tumors and multifocal gliomas are often cited examples, but rarely is this distinction difficult for an experienced clinician. Lymphoma more commonly masquerades as MS because the lesions may involve the white matter, may be multifocal, and are corticosteroid responsive. In addition, demyelination sometimes presents as one (or a few) mass lesion(s). In this situation, biopsy may be needed for diagnosis. Neoplasms can cause paraneoplastic syndromes that may be confused with MS. A high index of suspicion must be kept for older age at presentation, subacute ataxia, early dementia, and personality changes. A few metabolic disorders may resemble MS, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin E deficiency (seen in Bassen\u2010Kornzweig syndrome, hypobetalipoproteinemia, and Refsum's disease), and central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis (Video 113, Pontine Myelinolysis).

FLAIR imaging is especially helpful for evaluating periventricular lesions that may go unnoticed on regular T2\u2010weighted scans. The disadvantage of the technique is its relative insensitivity to posterior fossa lesions. Proton density weighted images are also part of the usual sets of images used in the MR diagnostics of MS. These images can be evaluated similarly to T2\u2010weighted images. Technically, they are usually acquired together with the T2\u2010weighted datasets, as a first echo in conventional fast spin echo sequences, where the subsequent echoes can be used for generating the T2\u2010weighted images. New T2\u2010weighted lesions have a fuzzy border and enlarge over a few weeks. After a period of stabilization, the T2\u2010weighted lesion regresses and becomes more sharply delineated from the surrounding white matter as edema resolves. Most of the time, a residual abnormality with increased T2 weighting and decreased T1\u2010weighted signal remains, reflecting demyelination and gliosis. The low attenuation T1 signal, or \u201cT1 black hole,\u201d is more often seen in secondary progressive MS and is thought to represent actual tissue loss. In several well\u2010documented cases, hypointense lesions on T2\u2010weighted scans were described in subcortical gray matter structures in MS patients. On a molecular level these areas are thought to represent iron deposition; their significance in MS is not fully understood. The MRI activity of disease, defined as either the number of new, recurrent, and enlarging lesions or the number of gadolinium\u2010enhancing lesions, is usually higher than the clinical activity.

Several MRI markers of gray matter involvement correlate better than measures of white matter pathology with clinical functional outcome measures in MS.

With this technique, a cubic volume of interest is defined based on a regular MR image set. Simultaneous acquisition of multiple volume units is possible. With long echo time (TE) studies, NAA (N\u2010acetylaspartate), choline, creatinine, and lactate peaks can be identified on the MR spectrum. With short TE studies, myoinositol, lipids, and some neurotransmitters may be identified. The resolution of the MR spectrum (the \u201cnumber of lines\u201d in the spectrum) is proportionate to the magnetic field strength used. NAA is the second most abundant amino acid constituent in the brain after glutamate. It is localized almost exclusively in neurons and axons. Creatinine is used as the \u201cconstant\u201d peak in a MR spectrum, since it is the least likely to be altered by CNS\u2010specific processes. Therefore, numeric MRS data are usually presented as ratios related to creatinine. The NAA/creatinine ratio is decreased in areas of axonal or neuronal loss. It correlates well with disability. It can be decreased in normal appearing white matter, also in early stages of lesion formation, thus representing a challenge to the usual dogma of axonal loss being secondary to myelin damage. The decrease of the NAA/creatinine ratio may return to normal following the resolution of the acute phase. This process may be related either to reversibility of neuronal injury or to disappearance of edema in the involved areas. In general, more reduced NAA peaks are seen in progressive forms of MS with more profound tissue loss. If a relatively large hemispheric lesion shows decreased NAA content, similar findings may be seen in the other hemisphere in a \u201cmirror\u201d location. The lactate peak can be elevated in a variety of acute processes, and as such, carries relatively low specificity. The short TE spectrum is used less frequently; the \u201cmobile lipid\u201d peak (which is thought to represent macromolecular protein fragments) is increased in areas of acute demyelination.",

In complex macromolecular systems, there is a baseline magnetization exchange in equilibrium between macromolecular protons and mobile protons. If the macromolecular protons are saturated before each excitation (and subsequent data acquisition) with a prolonged off\u2010resonance broadband pulse, then the signal intensity of the image will be reduced owing to magnetization transfer exchange between the saturated (\u201cbound\u201d) and free (\u201cmobile\u201d) protons. By obtaining duplicate sets of images (with and without magnetization transfer pulse), a magnetization transfer ratio can be calculated. The ratio reflects the integrity of the macromolecular environment. It is reduced by approximately 3% to 5% in areas of edema, but it is more significantly reduced in areas of demyelination or axonal loss. If the ratio \u201cnormalizes\u201d in a lesion, no subsequent tissue loss is usually seen on other imaging modalities. Despite these advantages, the magnetization transfer imaging is technically difficult because it produces variable findings depending on the technical environment and is not universally available.

It may be very useful as a marker for remyelination and tissue repair in future neuroprotective or tissue restorative trials.",

The proportion of \u03b3 globulin is high owing to the synthesis of immunoglobulins within the blood\u2010brain barrier. The majority of CSF immunoglobulin is IgG, although IgM and IgA may also be elevated. Measures of intrathecal IgG production have been devised that are more useful than simple \u03b3\u2010globulin levels. The IgG index and synthesis rate are elevated in 70% to 90% of CDMS patients and occasionally in other disorders. Agarose gel electrophoresis, or the more sensitive isoelectric focusing of CSF proteins, often reveals discrete bands of immunoglobulin, each a monoclonal antibody. It is pertinent to compare serum and CSF banding patterns because peripheral monoclonal gammopathies may produce CSF bands. To reduce false\u2010positive results, only unique CSF OCBs should be reported. Between 85% and 95% of clinically definite MS patients have OCBs; however, early in the course they are not as prevalent. Once present, OCBs persist and the pattern does not vary, although new bands occasionally appear. Unlike subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, in which the majority of OCBs are antibodies specific for measles virus, the antigenic specificity of OCBs in MS is unknown; they are unlikely to be pathogen specific or autoantigen directed; there is some evidence that they may be genetically determined germline antibodies. Five percent to 10% of noninflammatory CNS samples and 30% of inflammatory samples are also positive for OCBs.51 More detailed recommendations about the inclusion of CSF parameters to the diagnosis of MS were recently published52 suggesting that the cell count and differential should be completed within 2 hours. The new and recommended method for the detection of OCBs includes immunoelectophorsesis on agarose gel followed by immunoblotting. The reported sensitivity of this technique is above 95%, with a specificity of 86% to 87%. In other inflammatory or infectious illnesses, OCBs are often transient features. Their persistence is more suggestive of MS. The presence of myelin components, antimyelin antibodies, and kappa light chains in CSF has also been used in the diagnosis of MS.

In keeping with the definition that clinical relapses must be separated by at least 1 month, it was agreed that new T2 lesions on MRI should occur at least 30 days after disease onset. This means that any new T2 lesion occurring at any time point after a so\u2010called reference scan performed at least 30 days after the onset of the initial clinical event is useful in meeting imaging diagnostic criteria for dissemination in time. It should be noted though that a new T2 lesion must be of sufficient size and location to exclude lesions that could have been missed previously for technical reasons of slice orientation, thickness or spacing, tissue contrast, patient motion, or other artifacts. This requires standardized scanning procedures with emphasis on careful repositioning, as well as input from qualified evaluators experienced in MS imaging. With the new revision, there are two ways to show dissemination in time using imaging: (1) detection of gadolinium enhancement at least 3 months after the onset of initial clinical event, if not at the site corresponding to the initial event; or (2) detection of a new T2 lesion if this appears at any time compared with a reference scan done at least 30 days after onset of the initial clinical event.",

Spinal cord imaging that detects typical MS cord lesions (minimal or no swelling of the cord; clearly hyperintense on T2\u2010weighted imaging; at least 3 mm in size, but less than two vertebral segments long; and occupying only part of the cord cross section) is particularly helpful if brain imaging does not detect dissemination in space in a patient suspected to have MS. For dissemination in space, a spinal cord lesion is equivalent to, and can substitute for, a brain infratentorial lesion, but not for a periventricular or juxtacortical lesion. An enhancing spinal cord lesion is equivalent to an enhancing brain lesion, and an enhancing spinal cord lesion can \u201ccount\u201d doubly in fulfilling the criteria (e.g., a single enhancing spinal cord lesion can \u201ccount\u201d for an enhancing lesion and an infratentorial lesion). Individual cord lesions can contribute together with individual brain lesions to reach the required nine T2 lesions to satisfy the Barkhof\u2010Tintore criteria (the MRI criteria incorporated in the original McDonald's criteria). The panel recognized that diffuse cord changes may occur in MS, especially in the progressive forms; however, these changes are not sufficiently reliable to allow for their incorporation into the diagnostic criteria at this time. Repeat spinal cord imaging in patients without new symptoms of myelitis has a low yield in efforts to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in time. In other words, while it is common to see asymptomatic new brain lesions on repeated scans, new cord lesions generally do result in new neurological symptoms.

All positive sera for NAbs seem to cross\u2010react with both interferon\u2010\u03b2 1a and 1b.

Recent studies seem to support that NAb formation reduces clinical and MRI effects although often NAb formation subsides with time. There are no firm guidelines for monitoring NAb formation. Most physicians do not measure NAbs but rather change therapies empirically when patients appear to be failing treatment. Low titer Nabs may be just transient phenomenon related to IFN treatment; persistent high titer NAbs on two consecutive tests at least 6 months apart is likely associated with poor treatment response to INF.",

In a recent placebo\u2010controlled trial, patients randomized to a high dose of interferon\u2010\u03b2 1a (44 \u03bcg three times per week) did better than those receiving half this weekly dose. Both groups outperformed placebo and the high dose seemed to have more effect on relapse severity, hospitalizations, MRI activity, and lesion volume accumulation, and possibly on delaying disability in the most severely disabled patients. At the end of the 2 years of follow\u2010up, placebo\u2010treated patients were randomized to 22 or 44 \u03bcg subcutaneously three times weekly; patients on active treatment were continued on their original dose.67 The authors reported a benefit for the higher dose and for those treated for the full 4 years, again suggesting that early treatment and perhaps higher doses of interferons may be beneficial. The primary outcome, however, was relapse count per patient per 4 years and, as such, patients treated early had a significant advantage using this outcome measure. There were trends favoring the higher dose (relapse rate, MRI volumes; not for time to first confirmed progression, however). The authors did not make statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons and there were many dropouts in the high\u2010dose groups, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Again, the answer to the question about the benefit of early treatment can best come from long\u2010term (perhaps 8 to 10 years) studies using \u201chard outcomes\u201d (e.g., time to progression, major milestones in disability). The EBM calculations based on the \u201cproportion relapse free\u201d data for the original interferon\u2010\u03b2 1a (Rebif) study show an RRR of 19%, and ARR of 16%, and an NNT of 6 over 2 years to increase the number of relapse free by one.

A phase 2 study established84 that a 300\u2010mg monthly dose reduced the number of gadolinium\u2010enhancing lesions by 90% and the clinical relapse rate by over 50% compared to placebo. This study was followed by the AFFIRM and SENTINEL phase III studies. The AFFIRM study enrolled over 900 patients with RRMS; none of them had been on other approved immunomodulators for longer than 6 months. The annualized relapse rate at 1 year was reduced from 0.74 in the placebo group to 0.25 in the treated group (66% relative reduction, p < 0.0001). The proportion of relapse\u2010free patients was 76% in the treated group, 53% in the placebo group. The number of enhancing lesions was reduced by 92%, and the number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 80%. The proportion of patients without clinical and MRI activity was 46% in the natalizumab group, and 14% in the placebo group. In the SENTINEL trial, the combination of intramuscular interferon\u2010\u03b2 1a and natalizumab was studied against IM interferon\u2010\u03b2 1a and placebo in patients who had demonstrated an incomplete response (relapse suppression) to interferon therapy. The EBM calculations of the AFFIRM data based on proportion with relapses suggests an RRR of 49%, an ARR of 23%, and an NNT of 4 over 1 year to increase the proportion of relapse free by one. The SENTINEL data shows an RRR of 31%, an ARR of 17%, and an NNT of 6 over 1 year to increase the proportion relapse free. The original pilot trial data shows a RRR of 50% and an ARR of 19%, with an NNT of 5 over 6 months to increase the proportion relapse free. Based on these data, the FDA granted expedited approval of natalizumab on November 23, 2004.",

A third PML case was later identified from one of the phase III inflammatory bowel trials of this agent. At the time of writing this manuscript, natalizumab is still off the market. The natalizumab story has received significant media attention. Several consequences can be drawn from this failure. First, highly potent immunomodulators like natalizumab are best used by specialists in selected cases. A large number of prescriptions were written for natalizumab during its short 3 months on the market, including prescriptions by general practitioners. Widespread use of such medication in relatively stable cases of MS is not indicated. Second, the combination of potent immunomodulators may result in unpredictable adverse outcomes. Many MS experts anticipate that in the future MS therapies will need to be administered in combination to optimize therapeutic benefit. However, the exact effect of such combinations on the highly complex immune system is difficult if not impossible to predict. Furthermore, our inability to treat MS more effectively does not stem from the fact that we can not provide powerful immunosuppression, as evidenced by the autologous bone marrow transplantation studies. MS is a complex disease with a prominent inflammatory component; however, increasing evidence suggests that the neurodegenerative component of this illness may be independent of the inflammatory component, and is just as important, if not more important, from the standpoint of long\u2010term disability. Third, in chronic diseases such as MS, a short 1\u2010year trial, no matter how convincing the outcome may be, should not be considered sufficient to approve a medication, which will then be used in tens of thousands of patients on a \u201clifelong\u201d basis. There clearly is a need for new and more effective medications for treating MS; however, clinical trials in chronic conditions are very difficult to sustain. To overcome this, many MS trials use primary MRI outcome measures, since inflammation and new lesion formation\u2010related MRI markers respond more immediately to treatment; however, these markers do not correlate well with long term disability, as discussed earlier.",

One must realize that even though there are medications available for relapsing forms of MS, all the currently available therapies are only partially effective, the most reliable data is about short\u2010term relapse rate reduction, and a relapse rate reduction does not necessarily translate into reduction of future disabilities. Natural history data clearly suggest that a subset of MS patients will do very well without treatment (see discussion about the Olmsted County cohort later); this information can be very useful when deciding about treatment in patients with a 5\u2010 or 10\u2010year disease history and minimal disability (EDSS \u2264 2.0). In this patient group, a careful wait and see approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable. Counseling of newly diagnosed MS patients is of crucial importance, and it should usually include family members. Most patients have easy access to an abundance of frequently misleading information on the Internet, or from relatives and friends with MS. It is important to realize that every case is different; however, through the rational use of natural history data, clinical and MRI features of the specific case, and the clear understanding of the available clinical trial data, the clinician should be able to provide customized and relevant advice to patients and families. Considering that the treatments are only partially effective, the wishes of an educated patient constitute an important part in the decision\u2010making process. Ultimately, the treatment decisions should remain individualized between the patients and their treating physicians, and the physician's role as an information clearinghouse and educator cannot be overemphasized in this process.",

There is evidence for a dose\u2010response relationship among the interferon products, mostly from the EVIDENCE and INCOMIN studies. The double dose IM interferon\u2010\u03b2 1a study did not show a dose\u2010response relationship; this may be related to the fact that the increased dose was given with the same frequency as the standard dose. The injectable immunomodulators have incomplete evidence for efficacy in disability\u2010based outcome measures. Many of the long\u2010term extension studies suffer from several drawbacks, including open label unblinded design, significant dropout rate, and lack of control subjects; this is especially true for the GA extension data.

The data by Confavreux and associates, however, suggest that the EDSS in populations of SPMS patients continues to progress independent of relapses94 once a \u201cfixed\u201d baseline level of moderate disability has been reached. Therefore, while interferons may reduce the relapse rate in SPMS, the rate of progression of disability may not be reduced by these treatments. More usually, SPMS patients are already on an injectable immunomodulator, and the question of whether it is worth continuing the therapy may come up, especially in patients who have a hard time tolerating these medications and feel that the side effects of the medications have a clear negative impact on their overall health. In these cases, we usually allow the patients to stop their medications. Just like in the RRMS cases, however, patient education about SPMS trials and realistic expectations about the treatment is a crucial element in the decision\u2010making process.

In a review of the literature, Ghalie97 estimated the risk of mitoxantrone therapy\u2010related acute leukemia in MS patients at 0.05% to 0.1%; in an international registry of MS patients taking mitoxantrone, the risk of leukemia seems somewhat higher. This therapy has been approved by the FDA for treatment of SPMS, but no peer\u2010reviewed full report of the MIMS study had been published until 4 years after the initial report in an abstracts form. The study98 showed a treatment effect in RRMS and SPMS patients with \u201crecent rapid worsening.\u201d The study had a high dropout rate and a small sample size. Most patients (74%) had relapses in the preceding 2 years, suggesting this cohort mostly includes worsening RRMS or PRMS patients, in whom a positive treatment effect is expected; however, it does not mean that for classic SPMS patients who no longer have relapses the study outcome is applicable, and it is especially not applicable to PPMS cases. The primary outcome measure was a composite score comprised of five clinical measures: change in EDSS at 2 years; change in Ambulation Index at 2 years; change in the baseline standardized neurological status at 2 years; number of relapses requiring corticosteroid treatment; and time to first relapse. Seventy\u2010seven percent completed 24 months of follow\u2010up. At 24 months, benefit was reported in all five components of the composite measure for both active treatment arms, with the overall greatest benefit noted between placebo and the group receiving mitoxantrone at a dose of 12 mg/m2. The magnitude of the effect on EDSS was rather modest (mean EDSS change for high\u2010dose mitoxantrone, \u20130.13 [SD 0.90] versus +0.23 [SD 1.01] in the placebo group). The MRI results of the MIMS trial were published in 2005 and are frankly disappointing.99 In a subset of 110 patients (out of 194 in the trial overall), the 12 mg/m2 dose failed to reach a significant difference from placebo as measured by the primary MRI outcome (total number of scans with gadolinium\u2010enhancing lesions). The 12 mg/m2 dose reduced the number of T2\u2010weighted lesions at month 24 (p = 0.027) and showed a trend at month 12 (p = 0.069). The number of active MR lesions showed a trend toward reduction in the 12 mg/m2 group only at month 24 (p = 0.054).",

No apparent differences were observed between home\u2010based or hospital\u2010based therapy. The addition of an evening dose of benzodiazepine may help relieve extensor spasms and clonus that may interfere with sleep. As spasticity worsens, it becomes necessary to use baclofen. Doses should be escalated slowly to prevent the occurrence of overt side effects, and up to 120 mg/day may be required. Although baclofen is well tolerated in most patients, limiting side effects such as sedation and increased muscle weakness may occur, and rarely a paradoxical increase in spasticity is noted. Liver enzyme elevation and nonconvulsive status epilepticus presenting as encephalopathy have also been reported in association with baclofen. Abrupt withdrawal of baclofen may result in hallucinations or seizures, making it necessary to taper doses. Despite symptomatic improvement, antispasticity measures may not increase function or independence. In paraplegic patients with severe spasticity and intolerance to the required oral dose, intrathecal baclofen delivered by a subcutaneously implanted pump allows a much smaller dose and is often effective in alleviating intractable spasticity and may lessen urinary urgency.

Acutely, there is destruction with dense macrophage infiltration involving white and gray matter, loss of myelin and axons, and lymphocytic cuffing of vessels. In chronic lesions, the cord is atrophic and necrotic, occasionally with cystic degeneration and gliosis. In the absence of perivascular cuffing, these extensive lesions resemble infarctions. The prominent spinal cord swelling in the confines of the restrictive pia presumably may raise intramedullary pressure, leading to the collapse of small parenchymal vessels, further propagating tissue injury. Proliferation of vessels with thickened and hyalinized walls similar to that seen after infarction or other extensive injury may occur.116 Less fulminant lesions may coexist and are much more typical of inflammatory demyelination. The optic nerve lesions often involve the chiasm.

The mean age at onset of monophasic Devic's syndrome is 27, whereas relapsing NMO (see later) tends to occur in an older age group (mean age at onset of 43). Monophasic Devic's syndrome affects males and females equally, whereas relapsing NMO affects females predominantly (F:M, 3.8:1). One third of patients have a preceding infection within a few weeks of neurological symptom onset. Most commonly this is a nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection, flu, or gastroenteritis. The most common specific infections preceding the development of Devic's syndrome are chickenpox and pulmonary tuberculosis. Devic's syndrome has also followed vaccination for swine flu and mumps. Only a few instances of a possible familial occurrence of Devic's syndrome have been reported, and in one of these families, a unique mitochondrial mutation was found. Devic's syndrome is said to be more common in Japan and East Asia, although even there it is uncommon (less than 5 per 100,000). Three cases have been described in the literature with familial occurrence of Devic's disease in the Far East. In a genetic study, HLA\u2010DPB1*0501 was more frequently associated with \u201copticospinal MS,\u201d whereas HLA\u2010DPB1*0301 is the most strongly associated allele with conventional MS in the Japanese.",

Patients showing characteristics of the relapsing form of Devic's had a median interval of 166 days between index events, followed within 3 years by clusters of severe relapses isolated to the optic nerves and spinal cord. Most relapsing patients developed severe disability in a stepwise manner. Approximately one third died from respiratory failure. Predictors of a relapsing course in NMO118 include longer inter\u2010attack intervals (relative risk [RR]: 2.16 per month increase), older age at onset (RR = 1.08 per year increase), female sex (RR = 10.0), and less severe motor impairment with sentinel myelitis event (RR = 0.48 per severity scale point increase). Autoimmune disease history (RR = 4.15), higher attack frequency in first 2 years (RR = 1.21 per attack), and better recovery following index myelitis (RR = 1.84 per point) are associated with increased mortality rate. Features of NMO distinct from \u201ctypical\u201d MS included normal initial brain MRI, more than 50 cells/\u03bcL in CSF with polymorphonuclear predominance, and lesions extending over three or more vertebral segments on spinal cord MRI.
