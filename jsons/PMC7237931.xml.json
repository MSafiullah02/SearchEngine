This new coronavirus disease was named as COVID-19 on 11th February 2020, but by then it was spreading rapidly across the globe. By mid-January, the virus was being detected in other Asian countries like Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, and by late January the virus was first detected in Europe and America. On 11th March 2020 the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the global COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (World Health Organisation, 2020).",

As the number of Corona virus positive patients gradually started increasing across the country, the Central Government initiated measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019. On 3rd March 2020, India suspended all visas for citizens of Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan (the most severely affected nations at that time) with immediate effect, and advisories were issued against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea (The Hindu Net Desk, 2020). Medical screening was instituted for travellers arriving from 14 countries and by 6th March 2020 this was extended to include all international passengers (ET Bureau, 2020; The Hindu Net Desk, 2020). From 13th March 2020, India suspended visas for all travellers, including visa-free travel and those travellers allowed to enter were subject to quarantine orders (ET Bureau, 2020). Finally, after a 14-h long \u2018test curfew\u2019 on 22nd March, the Central Government announced a total lockdown, from 24th March to 14th April, which has been subsequently extended by 21 days to 3rd May 2020. This was the largest lockdown announced since the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, and in a country of 1.3 billion residents, this probably made it the biggest ever in the recorded history of humankind. At the time of writing this article there were 39,834 active cases of COVID-19 and 1981 deaths due to the virus in India (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2020). Simultaneously, three states, Goa, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur, had been declared COVID-19 free states as all the confirmed active cases in those states had recovered and had been discharged from quarantine (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2020).",

What are immediately and unavoidably apparent though are the collateral unintended consequences of the lockdown which have strong ethical and rights-related underpinnings. The most horrifying impact of the lockdown has been a rise in domestic and intimate partner violence, consistent with trends in other countries across the world (Bradbury-Jones & Isham, 2020; Gupta & Stah, 2020; Roy, 2020). With workplaces shut and families spending almost all of their waking hours together, sometimes in very close quarters, women in abusive situations have no respite. There have been several reports of people from Northeast India increasingly facing racist attacks in the rest of the country as the facial features of people from north eastern India can look similar to the Han Chinese (Karmakar, 2020). Finally, one of the most enduring and disturbing images of the lockdown in India is the long lines of migrant workers attempting to walk hundreds of miles to get back to their distant villages as work in the cities dried up (Pal & Siddiqui, 2020). One such complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption.",

            "text": "To set a broader global context, it is worth examining what has happened across the world as countries announced lockdowns in one form or the other. As restaurants and pubs started downing shutters across the USA to comply with physical distancing recommendations, Americans started stocking up on alcoholic beverages along with non-perishables, cleaning products and medical supplies (CPG, FMCG, & Retail, 2020). In the week ending 14th March 2020 the sales of beer, wine and spirits increased by 14%, 28% and 26%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Furthermore, amidst the restrictions placed by the physical-distancing recommendations a lot of sales were online in nature, and over one week in the middle of March such sales increased massively by 243% (Rayome, 2020). A similar pattern emerged in the UK as well, where alcohol sales in supermarkets and corner shops jumped by 22% in March. The total sales of wine, beer and spirits in the four weeks leading up to 22nd March went up by \u00a3199 million compared with the same period in 2019, and this growth outstripped that of food purchases, even though customers were stockpiling food items (5Pillars, 2020). Research by Alcohol Change UK conducted between 8th to 14th April 2020, found that one in five people (8.6 million adults) were drinking alcohol more frequently in the lockdown (Quinn, 2020; Thomas & Drummond, 2020).",

However, when the nationwide lockdown was announced, the State Government, decided to shut all liquor stores and bars in the state (OpIndia Staff, 2020). After this was announced, reports of drinkers dying by suicide started emerging in the media. A 38-year-old man allegedly died by suicide after he failed to get liquor during the countrywide lockdown (OpIndia Staff, 2020). Six other people were reported to have died of suicide as they were said to be \u2018frustrated\u2019 and experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms (ABP News Bureau, 2020). In response to such reports, the State Government decided to make alcohol available in limited quantities by issuing special passes for drinkers or by producing a doctor's prescription to purchase liquor (ABP News Bureau, 2020). However, the Kerala High Court stayed the State Government's order, opining that the government's decision was \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d (HT Correspondent, 2020).",

Although the common symptoms of AWS include tremors, excessive sweating etc., 15% of those experiencing AWS develop more severe symptoms such as epileptic seizures and delirium tremens (DT) (Chan et al., 2009; Mennecier et al., 2008). The mortality rates of those experiencing those experiencing such complications are very high (20%), but these can be drastically reduced to less than 1% through early detection and appropriate treatment (Mainerova et al., 2015). Quite clearly, in a lockdown situation, when someone with alcohol dependence runs out of alcohol one or more of the following might happen: he will go into alcohol withdrawal, get into risky situations such as drinking illicit or other non-consumable alcohol (there have been reports of people accidentally dying due to consumption of alcohol hand sanitisers), or impulsively harm themselves out of frustration arising from the situation.",

            "text": "Beyond the purely biological there are several other, and equally important, psychosocial aspects to this complex situation that we find ourselves in. One of the features of addictions is a self -perpetuating cycle of substance use leading to social isolation which in turn leads to more substance use. The lockdown and physical distancing due to COVID-19 is going to exacerbate the isolation and increase the risk of alcohol consumption and also lead to relapses in those who have recovered. Additionally, for those in recovery or wanting to start on that path, it is important that they feel the decision to stop drinking is an autonomous one that is regulated through choice as an expression of oneself and not pressured by environmental forces (Deci & Ryan, 1987). Long-term health benefits crucially result from autonomous behavioural decisions and behavioural changes resulting from such decisions that are not externally regulated are more sustainable (Dwyer, Hornsey, Smith, Oei, & Dingle, 2011; Williams, Gagn\u00e9, Ryan, & Deci, 2002). In the case of the lockdown any discontinuation of drinking is not by choice and loss of control over the decision can be detrimental to recovery. For others, the exacerbated anxiety and negative thinking that is inherent to the current experience of the pandemic and consequent lockdown can by itself be a significant trigger for relapse. And finally, in a setting when there is already an existing huge treatment gap for alcohol problems (86%), the highest amongst all mental and substance use disorders (Gururaj et al., 2016), the lockdown is further going to restrict access to all face to face services that they were already accessing (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) or would want to access. Thus the combination of the lockdown with the banning of alcohol has created a situation where drinkers could go into dangerous withdrawal and not have access to appropriate help, or relapse, which in turn could put them at risk due to consumption of illicit alcohol.",

While there is a well-accepted understanding that certain public health measures such as quarantine for infectious disease for a limited period based on medical recommendations may be proportionate and appropriate, it is open to debate whether imposing forced alcohol withdrawal on alcohol dependent individuals on the grounds of public health during a pandemic is either appropriate or proportionate. In a liberal democracy, adults have a right to live life as they wish provided they do not violate others' rights. Is the closing down of alcohol outlets truly a public health measure as a part of the larger lockdown to reduce the spread of the Corona virus or is it based on other principles that are espoused in support of prohibitionist policies such as the harm principle (alcohol use harms others), legal paternalism (alcohol use harms the drinker), legal moralism (alcohol use is immoral even if it does not harm), legal perfectionism (ideals of human excellence), and traditional conservatism (values of the majority).",

Evidence from various parts of the world, including from parts of India, indicate that there are limits to the effectiveness of alcohol prohibition as a public health measure (Blocker Jr, 2006). On the other hand the unintended adverse consequences are many. Prohibition is an invitation for illegal trade of alcohol to flourish. This in turn increases the harms associated with alcohol use in several ways- adulteration of illicit alcohol with more toxic substances, making it more dangerous to health, promoting corruption amongst enforcement agencies forcing otherwise law-abiding people to break the law to access illicit alcohol, and in this particular circumstance distracting officials from enforcing the more important requirements of a lockdown.",

In \u2018normal\u2019 times, approximately nine out of ten people with alcohol use disorders in India have no access to any kind of care for their drinking problems. Even in such \u2018normal\u2019 times when Bihar (population 100 million) a state in eastern India introduced prohibition, the health services did not have the capacity to deal with the drinkers who went into withdrawal. In unprecedented times like these where the health system is struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, it would cause a further burden on health systems. It raises the ethical question about the state stopping access to alcohol when it lacks the capacity and resources to provide adequate care to those who suffer the ill-effects of alcohol discontinuation.",

            "text": "Through most of the lockdown in India, only the sale of \u2018essential goods\u2019 is allowed, and alcoholic beverages are not considered as essential goods (except in state of Punjab), raising the question of how essential goods are defined. The Cambridge dictionary defines \u2018essential\u2019 as \u2018a basic thing that you cannot live without\u2019. However, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 gives \u2018essential commodities\u2019 an all-inclusive definition which \u201cmeans and includes any commodity in the list provided in the schedule to Section 2(a)\u201d of the Act. Not surprisingly, this list does not include alcohol. There is also a constitutional law issue in the way the Central government has banned alcohol. India is a quasi-federal state and the Constitution provides for a division of powers between the Central and State governments. Entry 8, List II (State List) in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution devolves powers upon the States to legislate and execute authority with respect to the \u201cproduction, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors\u201d. Further, Entry 6 of List II devolves powers on the State with respect to \u201cpublic health\u201d while Entry 29 of List III (Concurrent List) devolves powers on both the Central and State Governments in respect of \u201cprevention of extension from one State to another of infectious or contagious diseases\u2026\u201d. The current lockdown and banning of alcohol in the country has been enforced by the Central Government, by exercising its powers under Section 6 and Section 10 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA). By banning the sale/distribution of alcohol, the Central Government has impinged on the constitutional powers of the States to regulate the sale of alcohol. Further, it is argued that the Central Government is not empowered to derogate India's quasi-federal system by merely invoking the DMA's broad provisions so as to encroach upon the constitutional powers of the States to take appropriate measures in respect of regulating sale of alcohol, public health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The preamble of the DMA states the object of the Act as providing for \u201ceffective management of disasters\u2026\u201d while Section 2 (e) defines \u2018disaster management\u2019 in terms of: (i) prevention of danger or threat of any disaster; (ii) mitigation or reduction of risk of any disaster or its severity or consequences; (iii) capacity-building; (iv) preparedness to deal with any disaster; (v) prompt response to any threatening disaster situation or disaster; (vi) assessing the severity or magnitude of effects of any disaster; (vii) evacuation, rescue and relief; (viii) rehabilitation and reconstruction. It would be stretching this definition to argue that banning alcohol was necessary to mitigate, alleviate, rescue, relief or rehabilitate from the Coronavirus pandemic. It is thus difficult to justify the Central government impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic (Dwivedi, 2020).",

            "text": "Finally, it may be difficult for the State (central or state governments) to make unbiased decisions about this issue within the larger economic context. With respect to alcohol, the Indian State has always operated within an inherent conflict of interest where, on the one hand it has responsibility for the health of its citizens and on the other hand, it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. Alcohol taxes are the second major revenue-source for a majority of state governments, after sales tax. Although there are variations between individual states, on an average, most states derive around a fifth of their revenue from alcohol taxation, the second largest source after sales tax (Prasad, 2009). Indian states are expected to lose Rs 14,700 crore (approximately USD 2 billion) in alcohol revenue due to the ongoing lockdown (GoNews Desk, 2020). On the background of an existing economic slowdown this additional loss puts states under a major revenue crunch, and opening of liquor stores may unlock a much-needed source of income. Finally, there is industry pressure to contend with as well, which interestingly is taking a \u2018harm reduction\u2019 stance to influence the opening up of liquor sales. The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), the apex body of the Indian alcoholic beverage industry, has sent letters to chief ministers of several states urging for the resumption of sale of alcohol as \u2018there are growing reports of sale of illicit and spurious liquor in the state which can potentially lead to serious health hazards for people as well as create adverse law and order situation\u2019 (PTI, 2020). If the states decide to go down this route based purely on economic considerations, then they will lose the ethical (and public health) argument for keeping alcohol stores closed in the initial days of the lockdown. Finally, the challenge is to balance the reopening of liquor shops with physical distancing requirements, failing which, no amount of revenue collected will be able to reverse the damage done.",

Drinking behaviors do not occur within a vacuum and therefore forced abstinence might not be sustainable in the social context of the patient. A pragmatic approach rooted in the drinker's social context may be more achievable and provide quick benefit as it establishes agency in the drinker.

As and when alcohol sales are resumed we will have to deal with a cohort of individuals who had alcohol problems pre-lockdown and have now been forced into abstinence. Amongst that cohort will be those who choose to return to drinking. In those cases, the most pragmatic option for the state would be minimise the potential harm from their drinking which could arise directly through acute effects of alcohol intoxication spurred on by the long period of forced abstinence, effects on others around them such as domestic violence and diversion of scarce household finances from essential expenses to purchase of alcohol, and indirect effects on epidemic control measures such as physical distancing at sites where alcohol will be sold. Measures to operationalise these could include allowing home delivery of alcohol (which is currently not allowed by law) to help with physical distancing, raising alcohol taxes significantly so alcohol becomes more expensive (and consequently results in reduction in amount of drinking in some sub groups of drinkers)-this also has the added benefit of bringing revenue to states desperate for funds, reduce access by limiting the number of hours the outlets are kept open, and encourage alcohol treatment services in the public and civil society sector using innovative strategies such as tele-counselling. However, recent events have shown that implementing many of these will pose huge systemic challenges. After six weeks of lockdown when the Government allowed the re-opening of standalone liquor stores, the nation witnessed people queuing up over several kilometres to purchase alcohol and physical distancing rules being flouted, requiring shops to be shut down by the police (Dash, 2020), and the Supreme Court recommending alcohol home-delivery while leaving it to the States to take the final call (Thomas, 2020). Finally, the biggest challenge will be in helping those who wish to not go back to drinking. From a situation where alcohol was not available they are suddenly going to be again exposed to alcohol related cues which would increase their chances of relapsing. Ensuring that they have access to help which allows them to negotiate this risky period without returning back to drinking would require innovative solutions.",
