Annual epidemics are predictable and affect a relatively small percentage of the global population at any one time. Pandemics differ from epidemics in that they are a global phenomenon, affecting large numbers of people in multiple countries simultaneously. Pandemics tend to arise swiftly often out of the normal season, and affect a wider age group and spectrum of individuals than seasonal influenza. The first recorded influenza pandemic was in 1510 [1]. Since then human populations have been subjected to at least 15 pandemics, most notably in 1918 when estimates of the human deaths that resulted vary between 40 and 100 million [1, 2].",

Taubenberger joined forces with Terence Tumpey and colleagues at the CDC. They used the 1918 virus sequence information to generate plasmids containing the viral cDNA which when transfected into suitable mammalian cells, allowed the recovery of infectious 1918 virus [9, 11\u201316].",

Studies have been carried out to map the genetic determinants of this virus in the hope that this will help us to predict the virulence of future influenza strains as they emerge. The polymerase genes and the virus HA gene have been implicated in the extreme virulence of this virus, but work continues to understand the mechanisms by which this particular influenza strain is so deadly [26\u201329].",

After 1918, viruses derived from that outbreak continued to circulate in humans causing annual epidemics of moderate or mild severity [30]. However, because of their segmented genomes, influenza viruses are particularly prone to a special form of recombination known as reassortment that occurs if one host is coinfected by two different viruses. Such mixing events allow the introduction of genetic material from viruses that usually circulate in birds with the human adapted viruses, and new viruses thereby created may be able to cause a novel outbreak. We know that the two major pandemics in the second half of the twentieth century were formed in this way: The \u2018Asian\u2019 pandemic of 1957 was caused by the emergence of an H2N2 sub-type virus that retained the M, NP, PB2, PA and the NS of viruses derived directly from the 1918 virus, but obtained a new HA, NA and PB1 from an avian H2N2 virus. Because the human population had not experienced infection with a virus of H2 antigenic type, the entire world was susceptible and the virus spread rapidly.",

The 1968 H3N2 \u2018Hong Kong\u2019 pandemic that followed just 11 years later resulted in between one and two million deaths. This virus was a recombinant between the circulating human H2N2 virus and an avian strain with H3 HA. The reassortant virus still retained five segments originally derived from the 1918 strain, but acquired the HA and PB1 from the avian virus. Each of the H2 and H3 pandemic events were so universal that the virus displaced the previously circulating strains [31, 32]. In 1977, the H1N1 strain re-emerged as a circulating human strain (not to be confused with the 1976 swine H1N1 outbreak at Fort Dix). The colourfully named \u2018Red\u2019 or \u2018Russian\u2019 flu appeared initially in China in May of 1977 with isolates found in Russia soon after [33]. This strain produced a relatively mild disease mainly in young children. However, subsequent genetic analysis indicated a 27 year gap in the evolutionary history of this virus. In fact it was genetically similar to virus \u00adisolated in 1950. The eventual conclusion drawn was that this virus had been deep frozen in a laboratory and its release was accidental. The H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes have continued to co-circulate and to cause human seasonal influenza outbreaks into the twenty-first century (Fig. 2) [32\u201336].\n",

Serology conducted retrospectively detected neutralising antibodies in a far larger percentage of the population than could be expected from the reports of ILI. One in three of the children in London and Birmingham were seropositive for the virus by September 2009 [67] suggesting that many people who had the infection did not report it. This could be because the symptoms were sufficiently mild that they did not feel they needed the flu service that was on offer at the time, or they did not even realise they had the infection. In this respect, the population was fortunate; this virus spread effectively but did not produce overtly pathogenic effects in most people. The case fatality rate was 0.02%, far lower than the 2.5% of the 1918 pandemic or the 0.1% of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Despite that, there were over 1,500 hospitalizations due to influenza like illnesses in the UK and 474 deaths [68]. Globally mortality far exceeds 18,000 deaths [69].",

Similarly when a novel pandemic virus circulates widely, the incidence rate in the very young is particularly high and their clinical course in the face of lack of any relevant immunological experience is often severe. Indeed during the 2009 pandemic, the highest mortality rates were observed in those under 1 year of age [72]. In addition since school age children are major transmitters of influenza, there is good logic in targeting them in pandemic and seasonal immunization campaigns because overall community incidence may be curtailed in this way [73\u201376].",

This increased susceptibility has been ascribed to mechanical changes within the body, which act to increase the pressure on the cardiovascular system, including an increased heart rate, stroke volume and oxygen consumption set against a decreased lung capacity [91, 92]. This may also account for increased risk in obesity. In addition, hormonal changes in pregnancy cause what might be broadly termed a swing away from cell mediated immunity and a bias towards the humoral system that may affect the ability to clear the virus [92, 93]. On the other hand humoral immunity is also not complete in pregnancy and depletion in the levels of IgG2 were observed in pregnant women who died in the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic [94]. There is evidence from previous pandemics that the mortality rate was high amongst pregnant women: In the 1918 pandemic between 27% and 47% of those pregnant who contracted influenza died. In 1957 the percentage of deaths was lower, but still considerable at 20% [92]. There is also evidence of complications; of those pregnant women who developed pneumonia but survived during the 1918 pandemic, more than 50% did not carry the foetus to full term [92].",

Other fatal case studies have put the incidence of bacterial coinfections between 28% and 36% and also included Streptococcus pyogenes in the list of common bacterial coinfections [89, 97, 98]. In Argentina, coinfection with streptococci increased the likelihood of severe outcome with an odds ratio of 17 [99]. However in the UK, high incidence of bacterial coinfection was less evident [95]. The effect of bacterial superinfection on the outcome of infection with pandemic H1N1 2009 is likely to have been affected by differences in the bacterial strains circulating in communities around the world at the time and this may, in part, account for the widely different case fatality rates seen in different areas.",

The chosen seasonal viruses are recombined with the internal segments of the high growth A/Puerto Rico/08/34 (PR8) vaccine backbone strain, to create viruses with HA and NA antigens from seasonal strains that can be readily amplified in eggs. Similarly for the 2009 pandemic vaccine, a reassortant virus bearing the H1 HA and N1 NA genes of the pandemic strain A/California/07/2009 on a high growth body was used to generate high yield virus in eggs. However, vaccine production problems became apparent early during production phase when manufacturers realized that the growth of the Cal/07/09 reassortant was only 30\u201350% of that seen for the seasonal strains. Eventually a higher growth variant was obtained. In all about 30 versions of H1N1/2009 pandemic vaccine were generated in multiple countries by different manufacturers, with either wild type or reassortant viruses grown traditionally in eggs or in cell based systems and vaccines produced as spilt (just the HA and NA genes) preparations, whole inactivated virion preparations or, in one case, a live attenuated virus. Using a strategy based on development of H5N1 pandemic vaccines, the most widely used pandemic vaccine in the UK was an inactivated vaccine generated by GSK that was administered combined with AS03 adjuvant (composed of \u03b1-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80 emulsion) a chemical mix added to enhance and prolong the immunogenic response and reduce the amount of HA protein required per dose to achieve immunity (antigen sparing). The immunogenicity of the pandemic vaccine was in fact much higher than expected based on experience of clinical trials with the H5N1 equivalent. In the end, a single dose of adjuvanted vaccine was sufficient to achieve seroconversion in adults. Although it was expected that two doses would be needed in children, who usually require a prime boost regimen for effective levels of antibody to be achieved, a single dose was eventually used as it turned out to be adequately immunogenic and significantly less reactogenic after the first dose than the second [100]. This vaccine was recorded as having a 72% effectiveness despite the relatively small doses of 3.75 \u03bcg of HA protein (unadjuvanted vaccines typically contain 15\u201330 \u03bcg). Other adjuvants were also trialled globally including alum (aluminium hydroxide) in China and Russia and another oil-in-water adjuvant broadly similar to ASO3 called MF59 in Korea and Italy. Clinical trials were run using the proprietary Sanofi-Pasteur AF03 adjuvant in the USA, Europe and Asia [70].",

Itoh et al., compared seasonal H1N1 (A/Kawasaki/UTK-4/09) and pandemic H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) viruses in a number of animal models. Interestingly, infected mini-pigs remained relatively asymptomatic. In contrast, pH1N1 virus caused severe lung pathology in mice, ferrets and macaques including lung lesions and damage caused by the infiltration of inflammatory mediators to a greater extent than was observed with infection with the seasonal viruses [17, 101, 102]. Van de Brand et al., infected ferrets intratracheally with very high doses of seasonal H1N1, pH1N1 or HPAI H5N1 virus and found that infection with pH1N1 caused pathology intermediate between seasonal influenza and H5N1 and could lead to severe pneumonia and death in this model [17]. Infection of alveolar pneumocytes, not observed with the seasonal virus [17, 102] may correlate with the more profound binding of the pH1N1 HA to a-2,3 linked SA [63] which tends to be located deeper into the lung [103]. The difference between the animal models and the epidemiology in humans suggests that a basal level of existing immunity in the human population has protected against the moderately severe disease this virus can cause in immunologically naive experimental animals.",

Thus it is important to identify any mutations that may similarly increase virulence of the 2009 pH1N1 strain. In particular it was possible that critically ill or deceased patients had been infected with a virus variant that had more pathogenic potential than the viruses that predominated in the community. The sequence of viruses from such cases has been analysed in a number of studies [120\u2013125]. One of the interesting mutations observed is a D225G (H3 numbering, D222G in H1) mutation in the HA protein. 18% of critical cases in Norway and 12.5% of the critically ill in Hong Kong had this mutation [123].

However the same virus transmitted to a contact case, but did not lead to severe illness despite the latter individual having two hallmark co-morbidities, namely obesity and diabetes [121]. Although D225G was detected predominately in viruses from critical cases in Greece, it was also isolated in two mild cases of the disease [122]. It has been suggested that some of the reported isolates with this change are the results of egg adaptation during the culture period [126].

Additionally, increased binding to type II pneumocytes and macrophages in the alveoli and to submucosal glands in the trachea and bronchi may enhance lung damage [127]. However using reverse genetics to engineer this point mutation into an otherwise isogenic background, it was shown that the D225G change was not associated with an increase in virulence in the ferret or guinea pig models and remains easily transmitted between guinea pigs [127]. The mutation did result in a lower infectious dose for infection of mice who predominately express the a2,3, linked form of SA receptor [128].",

Loss of the C terminus of PB1-F2 removes the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the protein, abrogating its interaction with host proteins ANT3 and VDAC1 and reducing its ability to trigger apoptosis in immune cells [130, 137]. In addition this region of the protein appears to harbour pro-inflammatory properties. Indeed, peptides generated to contain amino acid sequence from the C-terminal region of PB1-F2 generated an inflammatory response when administered to mouse lung. Two days post exposure mice lost up to 15% body weight. Interestingly the same peptide derived from recent H3N2 seasonal virus contains 5 amino acid differences from early H3N2 homologues that appear to abrogate the pro-inflammatory function. Inflammation triggered by PB1-F2 peptides from highly virulent strains such as 1918 influenza may predispose to secondary bacterial pneumonia [138]. Indeed, some highly virulent viruses such as H5N1 and 1918 H1N1 viruses possess a point mutation in this region of PB1-F2, N66S, that is partly responsible for their enhanced morbidity and mortality in mice [139].",

            "text": "The tropism of influenza virus is not only determined by its receptor use. SA is a widely distributed cell surface sugar but influenza in humans is largely restricted to the respiratory tract. The reliance on host cell proteases to cleave and thus activate the fusogenic properties of the HA protein determines the organs in which the virus can undergo productive infection. In humans the abundance of Clara Tryptase in respiratory secretions allows the virus efficient replication in the lung [150]. In highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5 and H7 strains, the insertion of a polybasic motif allows the HA to be cleaved by ubiquitous proteases such as furin, facilitating systemic infection [151]. Despite the high mortality rates of those afflicted with the 1918 virus, it does not contain the polybasic cleavage site found in the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. The acquisition of this virulence motif in H5 and H7 subtypes of HA occurs during amplification in poultry [152, 153]. This motif has not been seen in any pH1N1 isolates in 2009 or 2010, and pH1N1 viruses remain dependent on the addition of trypsin to growth media for their propagation in cell culture.",

            "text": "The influenza virus counteracts the otherwise suppressive effect of the interferon response using a nonstructural protein NS1, reviewed in detail by Hale et al., [141]. NS1 works in at least two ways to prevent induction of interferon. Firstly in the cytoplasm NS1 binds dsRNA and other RNAs that are the likely triggers of innate immunity as well as forming a complex with the host cell pattern recognition receptor RIG-I and its controlling protein TRIM25. Secondly in the nucleus some NS1 proteins can bind to the host cell factor CPSF30 and in doing so they suppress the processing of newly synthesized mRNAs and prevent their export to the cytoplasm. This latter function is strain specific. It has been suggested that viruses that have enhanced ability to perform both these functions may induce a more severe disease because they can evade the innate immune response more efficiently. Indeed introduction of CPSF30 binding ability to the lab adapted PR8 vaccine strain that usually lack this function enhanced its virulence in mice [142]. The pH1N1 virus lacks CPSF binding capacity. However Hale et al. have shown that reintroduction of this phenotype did not affect virulence of pH1N1 in ferrets or mice [143]. Despite lacking CPSF30 binding capacity, the pH1N1 virus induces very low levels of interferon in infected cells [144].",

In contrast the re-emergence of H1N1 in humans in 1977 was not associated with subtype displacement likely because a large cohort of the older population was not susceptible to the virus and therefore remained viable hosts for the contemporary H3N2 viruses. Similarly due to residual immunity in the elderly, pH1N1 2009 has not displaced the H3N2 subtype. Initially it was believed that the seasonal H1N1 subtype may have gone extinct after pH1N1 emerged, as there was a period of many months where this virus was not isolated, however recently seasonal H1N1 isolates have been detected in Texas [145]. The trivalent vaccine administered in 2010 contains pH1N1, H3N2 and influenza B virus antigens but no seasonal H1N1 component.",

Infections peak once a year in the cold, dry season in the Northern or Southern hemispheres, although in the tropics the seasons are less clearly separated and it may be that virus continually circulates [146]. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) scheme in the UK has monitored the incidence of ILI since the emergence of the H3N2 subtype in the 1968 pandemic (Fig. 3), the re-emergence of related H3N2 and seasonal H1N1 strains has been observed year on year and is due to the capacity of the virus to accumulate small point mutations in HA and NA antigens, the process called antigenic drift. These mutations occur at antigenic sites and allow the circulating virus to evade immune suppression by throwing off antibody binding through confirmation changes or glycosylation events. Accumulated drift mutations may ultimately change the phenotype of the virus. The virus may alter its affinity or specificity for the receptors on the host cell surface in its efforts to avoid the immune response [147]. Indeed it is clear that, as it has evolved over four decades in humans, the H3N2 virus has changed its receptor binding affinities with phenotypic consequence [43, 148].",
