            "text": "HAIs have become an international problem even with the advances in the healthcare system (WHO, 2011). HAIs are among the most common diseases in hospitals with high morbidity and mortality rates (Ali et al., 2018). Khan et al. (2017) have argued that HAIs are associated with unforeseen infection advances throughout the duration of healthcare treatment; furthermore, HAIs cause notable patient disease, deaths, and prolonged hospitalization, which creates additional financial burden on patients. According to the WHO (2011), 7 out of 100 hospitalized patients developed HAIs worldwide. In the US, approximately 1.7 million infections are detected annually in hospitals, with 99,000 associated mortality (KCDCP, 2011). In Europe, approximately 7.1% patients develop HAIs, and 37,000 people die as a result (KCDCP, 2011). In one quantitative study in Saudi Arabia, 851 HAIs were reported among 5523 hospitalized patients; hospital stays amounted to 53,025 days, averaging 9 days of hospitalization (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2013). In November 2018, the country dealt with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak, which is a highly communicable and causes severe disease and result in high mortality (WHO, 2018). These infectious occurrences continue to escalate at an alarming rate and pose a risk among health care professionals and patients. Thus, prevention of infectious diseases should become a major health care professionals and patient-safety initiative.",

            "text": "For the past two decades, studies have reported that the application of infection control strategies, such as standard precautions in different healthcare settings, varies in different hospitals (Brosio et al., 2017; Kim and Oh, 2015; Pogorzelska-Maziarz et al., 2016). These variations could be attributed to different infection prevention climate of healthcare settings. Cruz (2018) suggested that infection prevention climate is commonly understood by health care professionals pertaining to infection prevention in clinical practice. This finding is worth noting because in a descriptive study by Castro-S\u00e1nchez and Holmes (2015), the infection prevention climate differences were due to standard precautions protocol, technical procedures, human resources, infection surveillance, and standard precautions compliance assessment. The variation could result in different geographical areas, healthcare facilities, and individual providers (Colet et al., 2018). With the increasing prevalence of HAIs across the globe (WHO, 2011), infection prevention climate variation most likely affects patient-care quality. Nevertheless, describing this variation could support the implementation of interventions in decreasing HAIs, where this is most needed.",

Although some studies showed that infection prevention was cautiously practiced by health care professionals in Saudi Arabia (Colet et al., 2018), training hospitals' infection prevention climate among nursing students is not well described.

The tool was designed to measure a hospital's culture for quality associated with infection prevention. It has 19 items and is responded using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The LCQ-IP has four dimensions, which are central to infection prevention framework. These four dimensions are \u201cpsychological safety (7 items), quality prioritization (5 items), supportive work environment (4 items), and improvement orientation (3 items)\u201d. Scores are obtained by computing the dimension means and overall scale mean. Item 16 is negatively worded; hence, its score is reversed before further analysis. The four factors have Cronbach's alpha from 0.724 to 0.883, whereas the entire scale has a Cronbach alpha of 0.926 (Pogorzelska-Maziarz et al., 2016). The Arabic version of the tool was used in the present study (Cruz, 2018). Cruz (2018) reported the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the tool among Saudi nursing students. The exploratory factor analysis of the Arabic version of the tool supported the four dimensions of the scale, which supported its construct validity. The Arabic version also exhibited good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.89.",

The finding can help nursing students to become competent and confident future healthcare professionals. Overall, the nursing students' infection prevention climate perspective needs further improvement, especially in terms of psychological safety and supportive work environment dimensions. Hence, organizing training and supervision and using supportive working condition strategies is necessary to make nursing students feel safe, creative, and engaged toward infection prevention and control implementation. Creating and defining nursing student's engagement rules should be done so that they can be comfortable, engage deeply, and communicate clearly to other health care professionals. In this regard, nursing students may feel included, important, and part of the healthcare team. A supportive working environment and high engagement can increase the students' motivation to tackle issues pertaining to infection prevention climate, development opportunities, and good performance. Facilitating meaningful connections between nursing students from various universities and their perceived infection prevention climate may improve through a comprehensive and unified course syllabus and supporting program that can empower students' learning. Given the positive relationship between participation in infection prevention seminar and infection prevention climate perceptions, increasing the number of training facilities that can provide a variety of training, workshop, and seminar programs to nursing students related to infection prevention is important.",
