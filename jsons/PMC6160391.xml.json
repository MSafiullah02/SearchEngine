Seasonal flu epidemics, which are caused by the co-circulating influenza A viruses (IAVs) and influenza B viruses (IBVs), occur annually and lead to tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and up to half a million human deaths worldwide each year (Ginsberg et al., 2009). Influenza pandemics are more devastating. The 2009 swine-originated H1N1 virus, which caused the latest influenza pandemic, spread from Mexico and U.S. to virtually all countries throughout the world within only several months and was associated much higher mortality among children, young adults, and pregnant women than typical seasonal influenza viruses (Fineberg, 2014). The zoonotic avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, H5N6, H7N9 and H10N8, cause alarmingly high fatality rate in human cases, raising a public concern of pandemic influenza outbreak of avian origin (Poovorawan et al., 2013; Barr, 2017; Bui et al., 2017).",

According to the traditional paradigm, after IAV gets across the mucus that covers the respiratory epithelium, it first invades and infects respiratory epithelial cells, from where it spreads to other non-immune and immune cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells). In these cells, the virus can be sensed by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), triggering the production of type I interferons (IFNs) which induce the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that block viral replication and further virus spread. Simultaneously, activation of PRRs also leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, TNF, etc.) and chemokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce topical and systemic inflammation, cause fever and anorexia, and direct the adaptive immune response against the virus. Chemokines, on the other hand, recruit innate immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes, and NK cells) which engulf and inactivate the virus, kill virally infected cells, and guide subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses that mediate ultimate viral clearance (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014).",

Infection with influenza viruses is usually self-limited, though the severe cases, especially caused by highly virulent strains (e.g., the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, H5N1 and H7N9) are characterized by severe pulmonary disease and lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Bauer et al., 2006; Ramsey and Kumar, 2011; Ma et al., 2017). Influenza-induced ARDS, which involves the damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier of the pulmonary alveolus, flute leakage to the alveolar lumen, and respiratory insufficiency, is associated not only with direct viral damage to epithelial-endothelial barrier, but also with inflammation mediated by components of the innate immune response. The cytokines produced in influenza virus infected epithelial and endothelial cells, and cytokines and reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils and macrophages recruited to pulmonary alveolus all contribute to damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier (Short et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Both the protective and pathological roles of innate immunity have been evidenced in human and experimental animals. On one hand, genetic deficiency in production of interferon or certain ISGs (e.g., MX and IFITM proteins) increases the vulnerability to IAV infection (Ciancanelli et al., 2015, 2016). On the other hand, genetic ablation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (Dienz et al., 2012), or chemical depletion of alveolar macrophages (Abboud et al., 2015), NK (Abboud et al., 2015) or neutrophils (Tate et al., 2009) in mice can exacerbate lung injury during IAV infection. These data support that both IFN response and inflammatory innate immune response are essential in protecting the host against IAV infections. However, gene expression analysis displays that early innate immunity signatures including pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6), chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1) and neutrophil infiltration are strongly associated with acute death of the mice infected with IAV (Brandes et al., 2013). In addition, deletion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF and various chemokines decrease mortality in IAV-infected mice (Teijaro, 2015). Furthermore, hyper expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are linked to the high mortality in human cases infected with highly pathogenic influenza virus strains such as 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus and H5N1 virus (Loo and Gale, 2007; Peiris et al., 2009). These data suggest that exaggerate inflammation during lethal infection with IAV can have fatal consequences. Therefore, benign outcomes of influenza virus infection results from inducing sufficient IFN-mediated antiviral immunity while avoiding harmful inflammatory response.",

The Mx1, ISG20 and IFITM1 also displayed markedly altered mRNA levels during IBV infection. In contrast, the expression of IFN-\u03b1 was not altered at all points (Fig. 1A). Since the function of both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1 is induction of ISG expression via the same intracellular signaling pathways, we speculate that it is IFN-\u03bb rather than IFN-\u03b1 that dominates the production of ISGs in IBV-infected A549 cells. Indeed, the IBV NP protein levels were obviously decreased in IFN-\u03bb stimulated A549 cells, indicating the potent antiviral activity during IBV replication in A549 cell (Fig. 1B).\n",

After binding to the receptor, the virus enters the endosome, where the acidic environment triggers virus-host cell membrane fusion, after which the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the virus-derived RNA is recognized by multiple canonical pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs, RIG-I, and MD5), the Toll-like receptors (TLRs, TLR-3, and 7), the NOD-like receptors (NLR and NOD1/2), and the PKR, and activates their respective signaling pathways.

The potential importance of type III IFNs has been suggested by life-threatening influenza developed in genetically deficiency that leads to impaired production of both type I and type III IFN production in a 9-year-old child (Ciancanelli et al., 2015). IFNLR is expressed by human hepatocytes, and IFNL polymorphisms are associated with ameliorated outcome from HCV and HBV infection (Bibert et al., 2013; Galmozzi et al., 2014). Clinical trials have displayed that the pegylated IFN-\u03bb can reduce the level of HCV and HBV in patients infected with chronic HCV and HBV, respectively (Zeuzem et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2017). IFN-\u03bbs are also highly expressed in gastrointestinal tracts, and can cure chronic murine norovirus infection without the presence of adaptive immunity (Nice et al., 2015).",

One of them is the determination of the crystal structure of an engineered high-affinity IFN-\u03bb3 (H11) in complex with its two receptors, IFN-\u03bbR1 and IL-10R. In this structure, the IFN-\u03bb3 helical bundle binds to the gorge formed by the two domains at the distal ends of its two receptors to the cellular membrane. In contrast, the two receptors bind to the opposite sides of the helical bundles of type I IFNs (Mendoza et al., 2017).",

This study shows that in mice infected with IAV, IFN-\u03bbs emerge earlier than type I IFNs and show potent protective function during the early phase of the infection, when type I IFNs are still scarce. Furthermore, IFN-\u03bbs treatment induces expression of antiviral genes but not pro-inflammatory cytokines in neutrophils, while type I IFNs induce the expression of both types of genes and are involved in causing inflammation and immunopathology.",

When engaged with their receptor complexes, both IFN-\u03bbs and type I IFNs activate JAK-family kinases, which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they associate with IRF9 to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and induces the expression of antiviral ISGs. However, engagement of type I IFNs with their receptor can also activate the STAT1 homodimer which binds to gamma-activated sequence (GAS) and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014). Thus, type I IFNs have the potential of inducing inflammation in addition to antiviral function, while IFN-\u03bbs promote the production of antiviral ISGs without the function of inducing inflammation (Fig. 2).",

Therefore, IFN-\u03bbs share the therapeutic benefits but eschews many side effects associated with the clinical use of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Lazear et al., 2015). In the future, scientists should explore the possibility that whether IFN-\u03bbs are more ideal therapeutic reagents for dealing with respiratory tract infection by viruses like IBV or not.",
