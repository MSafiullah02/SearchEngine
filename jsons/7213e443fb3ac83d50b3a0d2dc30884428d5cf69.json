It is of great public health and societal importance to evaluate the effects of interventions in the pandemic of COVID-19. In this paper, with help of synthetic control method, regression discontinuity and a Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model, we evaluate the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented in Wenzhou, a representative urban city of China, where stringent interventions were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation with rapidly increasing newly confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time.",

These strict control measures were implemented across Wenzhou, where one family member was assigned to go out for necessity purchase of each household every two days since February 1, 2020 (Wenzhou Municipal People's Government, 2020b). Thus, Wenzhou had adopted the stringent intervention policies, including both traffic blockade inside and outside the city, and the strictly closed management of the community, to intensively prevent and control of the epidemic situation of COVID-19. In addition, an industrial city of Guangdong province, which activated the first-level public health emergency response on January 23, 3 2020 (Health Commission of Guangdong Province, 2020), Shenzhen adopted closely following the close contact of confirmed cases and isolating them on the same time. Comparatively, Shenzhen implemented relatively mild but early interventions.",

We accomplished this through simulation by using the time-varying Susceptible-Infected and infectious without Quarantine-Hospitalized in quarantine-Removed (SIHR) model (Tan et al., 2020) .

The synthetic control method was used to construct a data-driven control-group in the absence of those interventions in Wenzhou (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) . The observed cases per 100,000 for Wenzhou (active intervention city) at the time t with interventions were denoted by Y 1 1t , and cases per 100,000 for cities j at the time t without interventions by Y 0 jt . The difference of Y 1 1t \u2212 Y 0 1t was the treatment effect of the interventions on the cases per 100,000 for the active intervention city in the post-interventions period. Note that Y 0 1t is counterfactual for the active intervention city in the post-interventions period. Reliable estimates of cases per 100,000 for a synthetic intervention city were used to derive Y 1 1t \u2212 Y 0 1t , where a synthetic intervention city resembled the active intervention city by possible pre-interventions characteristics. We selected the GDP per-capita , population density (Oto-Peral\u00edas, 2020), and three-day cases per 100,000 before the implementation of interventions to construct a resembling city of Wenzhou. The effects of unobserved factors varied over time and were controlled by the linear combination of cases per 100,000 of pre-interventions (Abadie et al., 2010) . Thus, the treatment effect of interventions in Wenzhou was formulated as (Abadie et al., 2011) :",

That is, since the intervention policies were implemented in Wenzhou (corresponding coefficient of policy : -0.350), the growth rate of the reported cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reduced, and this \"reduction\" effect would increase over time ( The horizontal and longitudinal comparisons were made to examine the treatment effects of the strict intervention policies implemented in Wenzhou, including the suspension of public transportation in the city, the closure of highway junctions, and strict community access control. Since January 21, 2020, compared with other cities outside Hubei province, the number of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Wenzhou had been consistently in the top two places, i.e., its COVID-19 epidemic situation was relatively severe. If strict intervention policies were not implemented, the outbreak of COVID-19 would be expected to expand to 1.7 times. Therefore, it can be concluded from the results of the two methods that the strict intervention policies in Wenzhou, where the epidemic was severe, had significantly suppressed its epidemic situation.

The grey dashed line indicated 2 days delay of implementation of the intervention policies in Wenzhou. A placebo test was performed to determine the significance level of the difference in the trends of COVID-19 cases per 100,000. To this end, we plotted the gap curves between Wenzhou and synthetic Wenzhou by in turn exchanging Wenzhou and one of each 44 cities in the homogenous group of Wenzhou. The gap of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 between Wenzhou and our synthetic Wenzhou was the largest compared to the rest, i.e. the intervention policies on COVID-19 per 100,000 in Wenzhou was the lowest of all. For those 44 cities, the probability of having a gap for Wenzhou under a random permutation of the control measures was 5%, which is conventionally regarded as statistically significant. This suggested that the effect of the implementation of the policies in Wenzhou was significantly different from the implementation of the policies in the remaining 44 cities, indicating that the strict interventions of Wenzhou might have significantly reduced the COVID-19 cases per 100,000 (Figure 2).",
