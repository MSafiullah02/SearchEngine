A significant portion of this useful information is stored in PDF files \u2013 research articles, books, company reports, and presentations are typically disseminated in PDF format. PDF documents need to be converted into plain text before being processed by an Information Retrieval (IR) or a text mining system. These files can either be digitally created or created from scanned documents. While the former are generated from an original electronic version of a document (i.e., contain the text characters), the later contain images of the original document and need to go through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) so that their contents can be extracted. Despite being addressed by researchers for decades, OCR is still imperfect. As a result, the extracted text contains errors that typically involve character exchanges. Although digitally created PDFs are cleaner, they are not problem-free since, for example, hyphenated terms (due to separation into syllables) may be identified as two tokens and indexed incorrectly.",

Approaches for treating misspelled queries cannot solve this problem as the issue is in the document, not in the query. Furthermore, there are important differences between the types of errors made by humans while typing and those made by OCR systems [9].",

Ideally, to quantify the impact, one needs an IR test collection with source PDF files, their extracted and corrected versions, a set of queries, and their corresponding relevance judgments. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, such a collection does not exist and creating one would demand significant effort. In line with previous works on this topic [3, 7], our approach was to systematically insert errors in a standard IR collection containing plain text documents, queries, and relevance judgments. Different error rates were tested so that we could gauge their effects. In order to simulate real errors, we collected, assessed, and manually corrected a sample of OCR-ed PDF documents. Statistics drawn from this sample were used to guide the error insertion approach. Our experiments were performed in an IR collection containing documents in Portuguese \u2013 a language that makes use of diacritics (e.g., \u00e0, \u00e1, \u00e3, \u00e2, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00e7 etc.). These characters are typically among the ones with more extraction errors. The results showed that error rates starting at 5% can cause a significant impact in many system configurations and that stemming makes systems more robust to coping with errors.\n",

            "text": "Existing work on dealing with OCR-ed texts spans over a long period and focused on approaches for detecting and fixing errors [4, 5, 9, 10]. Specifically on the topic of improving the retrieval of OCR text, Beitzel et al. [1] surveyed a number of solutions \u2013 most of which date to the late 1990s. TREC ran a confusion track to assess retrieval effectiveness on degraded collections. Their modified test collections had 5 and 20% character error rates. Five teams took part in the challenge. The organizers reported that counter-intuitive results had been found and that \u201cthere is still a great deal to be understood about the interaction of the diverse approaches\u201d [7]. Croft et al.  [3] share some similarities with our work. However, rather than injecting errors into a clean text collection, the authors opted to randomly select words to be discarded from the document and, as a consequence, they were not indexed. The limitation of such approach is that it does not account for issues with wrong segmentation (adding or suppressing the space character) or cases in which the error modifies the word into another valid word. The main finding was that performance degradation was more critical for very short documents. In a detailed investigation, Taghva et al.  [13] observed that while the results seem to have insignificant degradation on average, individual queries can be greatly impacted. Furthermore, they report an impressive increase in the number of index terms in the presence of errors and that relevance feedback methods are unable to overcome OCR errors.",

This is the most common error found (90% of all errors) and it is caused by the low quality of the documents we are processing. Every exchange in our exchange list has assigned to itself the frequency of its appearance, which we use, in conjunction with the tournament selection, to elect one error to a given term. (ii) Separated terms. This error corresponds to 5% of the cases and it happens when a space character is erroneously inserted in the middle of a term. (iii) Joined terms. This error, which has a frequency of 4.9%, happens when the space between terms is omitted, resulting in the unexpected concatenation of terms. (iv) Erroneous symbol. This issue accounts for 0.1% of all errors, usually represents dirt or a printing error at the scanned document.",

Nearly all runs in which stemming was used had smaller losses than their counterparts. Furthermore, the aid of stemming is more noticeable in the runs with higher error rates. The benefit of stemming can be explained by the fact that the OCR error can be in the suffix that is removed. Looking at the correlation between the number of index terms (Table 2) and MAP, we find a strong negative correlation of 0.86. When the correlation is measured for stemmed and unstemmed runs separately, the negative correlations are 0.81 and 0.90, respectively. This gives further support to the benefits of stemming.\n",
