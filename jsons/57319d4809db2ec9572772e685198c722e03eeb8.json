There are about 20 million people living in Shenzhen, of which the external population from the internal area of China, including Hubei province, account for a large proportion. High population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility may increase the possibility of COVID-19 outbreak [7, 8] . The first COVID-19 patient in Shenzhen was admitted on January 9, 2020, and 419 cases have been confirmed by March 7, 2020 , which ranked the top cities outside Wuhan. Most of these patients were imported cases from Hubei province, and there was no large-scale transmission and nosocomial infection in Shenzhen until now.",

The preventive strategies can be divided into early prevention and strengthened prevention. Early preventive strategies and measures against COVID-19 included public announcement of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei and preparation for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in hospitals. The hospitals have begun to prepare for the possible outbreak of COVID-19 since January 15, including the training of medical staff and epidemiological investigators, hospital disinfection, medical material reserve, outpatient adjustment, medical waste management, and so on. All 49 hospitals in Shenzhen set up 24-hour fever clinics for screening of possible COVID-19with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting. Suspected patients would be isolated and observed in single room for each case with special preparation of infection control measures in the hospital. Confirmed patients will be transferred to Shenzhen infectious disease hospital for treatment with negativepressure ambulance, which was a designated hospital for inpatient management of infectious disease.",

            "text": ", the peak of new confirmed cases coincided with the implementation of serial preventive strategy and measures, indicating these preventive strategies and measures were effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei on January 23 and the next few days was also important for the reduction of imported cases in Shenzhen, which reduces the difficulty of prevention in Shenzhen. Most of the imported cases after the lockdown left Hubei before January 23 and arrived at Shenzhen later, which leaded to the increasing of imported cases in a few days after January 23 (Figure 1). Meanwhile, there was no infection among medical staff or patients infected in hospital environment in Shenzhen hospitals until March 7. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into the city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.",
