In this regard, it has had a highly significant impact on our gastroenterology and hepatology departments, which have reduced both their hospitalization activity (by more than 50 %) and the number of diagnostic/therapeutic endoscopic procedures (by more than 50 %, unpublished data). Besides affecting our activity, it also affected our work, with high numbers of gastroenterologists being moved to COVID areas. Finally, some -in fact many-of our colleagues have fallen ill as a consequence of caring for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Let us not forget that some of the procedures we carry out on a daily basis are associated with a high risk for COVID-19 transmission (3) (4) (5) . Even if its incidence diminishes considerably, it will stay with us over the coming months, which should prompt us to take extreme precautions in a micro-environment with a high risk for coronavirus transmission as is the case with hospitals.",

Since the present situation lacks consistency (different Autonomous Communities, hospitals, SARS-CoV-2 incidences, public/private centers, etc.), the right time to implement these recommendations may vary. Be it as it may, we propose that the transition from the current state of alarm, which has brought activity in our departments to a virtually complete standstill, to a more normal situation be accomplished in three phases: activity resumption phase, stabilization phase, and normalization phase. The length of these phases is difficult to foretell in such dynamic, highly changing scenario, but will not foreseeably be shorter than 2-4 months. Furthermore, when will the human and space resources redeployed to caring for COVID-19 patients be recovered by our departments remains yet unknown.",

Cirrhotic patients must be screened for HCC, but minimally increasing monitoring intervals seems a reasonable thing to do. e. In patients with chronic liver disease on treatment for infection with SARS-CoV-2 liver function must be monitored as there is a risk of hepatotoxicity, usually mild, associated with drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab. In these patients, their use should be warned off outside of clinical trials.f. In our opinion, portal hemodynamics measurements should only be carried out during the first phase for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma where knowledge of the portal pressure gradient may result in therapy changes; transjugular biopsy may be advisable in case of acute liver failure. TIPS placement may only be recommended in the setting of a life-threatening emergency. Recommendations in case of patients with liver cancer In this scenario, where a high number of patients require admission and intensive care, medical resources are diverted from the care for other patients, including patients with cancer. It is unclear whether liver cancer patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 or have more severe SARS-CoV-2 manifestations, but both situations have been described for patients with other solid tumors, particularly when receiving chemotherapy (38). We specifically recommend: a. Consider surgery and transplantation for these patients according to resource availability in each center. In centers where these procedures are to be delayed bridge therapies such as ablation or intra-arterial treatment (TACE, radioembolization) may be used. b. Ablation or intra-arterial procedures, while potentially limited by the availability of anesthesiologists or hospitalization beds, usually require short stays and no intensive care, the latter likely being the most critically scarce resource during this pandemic. Nevertheless, candidate selection shall be rigorous to eliminate patients with higher risk for complications. c. Patients should only be included in clinical trials when no other therapeutic option is available. Hence, among advanced cases candidate to systemic therapy, only those on second-line treatment should be enrolled. Sorafenib or lenvatinib should be used as first line. d. Virtual interdisciplinary committees should be maintained to ensure decision making, often removed from usual practice during the present crisis. Patients with decompensated liver disease on the liver transplant (LT) waiting list Information about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with decompensated cirrhosis or on the transplant waiting list is very limited. Many units found themselves forced to perform no transplantations during this period of time because of lacking resources. Efforts should be made to normalize this situation as soon as resources in each hospital return to normal. In this setting transplant units must maintain an ongoing assessment of the patients on their wait list, particularly in cases with high MELD for tumor progression, considering their risk-benefit ratio. It is acceptable that in selected stable cases transplantation be postponed in spite of available donors.",
