Although infections in humans are unusual, they can be particularly severe if when occur (Cherubin, 1980). During the 1950s and 1960s, S. Choleraesuis was the predominant serovar in pigs all over the world and although it is still very common in North America and Asia, it is rarely detected in Australia and Western Europe (Fedorka\u2010Cray, Gray, & Wray, 2000). Most cases reported in Europe came from Estonia and Romania (EFSA, 2015).",

Choleraesuis is becoming more prevalent in wild boars from Europe, whose population has increased during the last decades (Massei et al., 2015). In some areas of south\u2010central Spain, the management of the wild boars populations for hunting purposes, including feeding and sometimes estate fencing, increases the risk of occurrence and transmission of diseases (Gort\u00e1zar, Acevedo, Ruiz\u2010Fons, & Vicente, 2006). Regarding Salmonellosis, several outbreaks have been reported in Europe in recent years. For example, septicaemic processes, very similar to those described in pigs, were reported in Germany and Italy between the years 2006 and 2013 (Conedera et al., 2014; Methner, Heller, & Bocklisch, 2010).",

The continuous growth experienced in game meat consumption and the growing wild boar population density, are helping to increase the chances of disease transmission. Furthermore, it has been shown that 44% of the Salmonella samples isolated from meat or veterinary sources carried resistance to at least one type of antibiotic (Foley & Lynne, 2008). This fact is of major importance, as it is assumed that humans and livestock may be sources for antimicrobial resistance in wildlife (Mentaberre et al., 2013; Navarro\u2010Gonzalez et al., 2012).",

Most of them were fenced estates (6/10), characterized by a perimeter hunting fence to avoid the pass or scape of animals. Game estate managers generally use cereals or feed as supplements to the natural diet for their wild boars, mostly during the summer. Additionally, two estates were open, with no fences at all, which allow the animals to move freely, where no supplementation is provided. And finally, the remainder 2 (F1 and F10) are considered as \u201chunting farms\u201d. They are larger estates with effective perimetral and internal fencing. Internal fences isolate an area which serve as breeding centre, supplying wild boars for hunting in specific areas of the same estate or to be sold and transported for hunting in different ones. The managing system in those farms is semi\u2010intensive, but there are several differences between them. F1 is a 15 Ha farm divided into three identical plots. Plot number one contains 40 females, aged 4. Plot number two contains eight males also aged 4, and the last plot contains the weaned piglets. The animals are vaccinated only against Aujeszky's disease, as this is the only compulsory vaccination for this type of farms. The water is chlorinated and available in drinking troughs, although there were also places where rainwater accumulates. In contrast, F10 farm is divided only into two plots; a small one of approximately 2 Ha and another of 10 Ha. The first plot contained a mixed group of 120 wild boar piglets aging from 2.5 to 6 months that had been previously captured from the bigger plot. After an adaptation period, all the animals ageing 1 year old were moved to the bigger plot. F10 managers did not implement any vaccination protocol and the water supply was not chlorinated in this farm.",

The outbreaks reported in this study were characterized by remarkably high mortality rates, 35%\u201384.5%, much more elevated than the 10% reported in the only case known to date for farmed wild boars in Spain (P\u00e9rez et al., 1999), and more similar, but still higher than the 4.2%\u201333% rates described in pigs from Denmark and Japan (Murakami et al., 2006; Pedersen et al., 2015). Our results seem to contradict the idea that wild boars act only as reservoirs for Salmonella, being carriers and intermittent shedders (Ruiz\u2010Fons, 2017). The age of the affected wild boars resulted similar than those described in the literature for pigs or wild boars, being related to the weaning period or other stressing conditions as well (Carlson, Barnhill, & Griffith, 2012; Perez et al., 1999). It should be noted that the highest rates came exclusively from the estates with semi\u2010intensive management of the animals, F1 and F10, where stressful conditions may have a major impact on the health status of the animals (Giles, Belkhiri, Barrow, & Foster, 2017). This fact, together with the poor specific immunity of wild boars against S. Choleraesuis (Methner et al., 2010), could decrease their natural resistance and even activate dormant S. Choleraesuis (Chiu, Su, & Chu, 2004). In our cases, weaning (F1) and grouping animals of different ages and origins (F10) were probably the situations that triggered the outbreaks. Both measures are likely to induce stress and thus facilitate the exchange and dissemination of pathogens (Giles et al., 2017; Roth & Thacker, 2006). The higher mortality observed in F1 could be due to the fact that at ages of 2\u20103 months the piglets show the lowest level of antibodies since birth, being much more susceptible to infections (Tizard, 2009).",

High animal densities would have a major impact on the hygienic habits of the animals and also on their social stress (Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Llario, Carranza, & Hidalgo de Trucios, 1996; Morrow\u2010Tesch, McGlone, & Salak\u2010Johnson, 1994), facilitating the contagion and development of pathological processes. In addition, it should be considered that initially harmless pathogens such as S. serovar Saintpaul, could produce symptoms of marked virulence in wild boars (Ecco, Guedes, Tury, Santos, & Perecmanis, 2006). In the same way, some common porcine pathogens cause especially high mortalities in this species, e.g., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Pasteurella multocida, or Staphylocccus hyicus (Risco, Fernandez\u2010Llario, Cuesta, et al., 2013; Risco, Fernandez\u2010Llario, Velarde, et al., 2013; Risco et al., 2011). So, while the infective doses of S. Choleraesuis necessary for the onset of the disease in young pigs in natural conditions are >108 UFC/g. (Gray, Fedorka\u2010Cray, Stabel, & Kramer, 1996), in wild boar, due to their poor specific immunity, these doses could be much smaller (Methner et al., 2010). Altogether, these findings highlight how critical an adequate management of wild boars could be in semi\u2010intensive conditions.",

Nevertheless, in our samples, only two animals showed high values of both IgG and IgM against PCV\u20102, indicating an active status of this viral infection at the time of death. These two animals belonged to the same farm (F10) and outbreak (July, 2015). The rest of the animals resulted negative to the active presence of PCV\u20102 or PRRSV. Similar results were also described more recently in Italy (Conedera et al., 2014), where none of the wild boars analysed was positive to those viruses. Taken together, these data suggest that, in wild boar, S. Choleraesuis does not need a previous immunosuppressant infection in order to develop a pathological process.",

In accordance with the aforementioned reports, the lesions found in our study indicated a septicaemic presentation, as confirmed by the isolation of S. Choleraesuis from nongastrointestinal organs, most notably lungs. This presentation is often related to an inhalatory transmission (Gray, Fedorka\u2010Cray, Stabel, & Ackermann, 1995) which have been shown to be more frequent than oral (Clemmer, Hickey, Bridges, Schliessmann, & Shaffer, 1960), especially in intensive breeding farms and in the summer months, due to the dryness of soil (Baskerville & Dow, 1973). In our study, 18 of the 28 samples were collected in summer, similar to all the outbreaks reported previously in this species (Methner et al., 2010; Perez et al., 1999), suggesting that dust and aerosols generated by sneezing could have a mayor impact in the transmission and dissemination of the disease in wild boars groups (Fedorka\u2010Cray et al., 2000).",

This could be related to the regular use of single sulphonamides or combinations of sulphonamides with tetracyclines in the prophylaxis and treatment of diverse pathologies that historically affected some of the farms in this study. A similar result was also obtained in Danish pig herds, in the only study reported to date in Europe about antibiotic resistance in S. Choleraesuis from pigs (Pedersen et al., 2015). Studies from United States showed higher rates of resistance to tetracyclines (92.6%) (Huang, Lin, & Wu, 2009) while data from Japan revealed multidrug resistant isolates with resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporines (Asai et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2004). Other screening performed in wild boars from Germany revealed high resistance of S. Choleraesuis to sulphamethoxazole and streptomycin (Methner et al., 2010) whereas very high rates of resistance against streptomycin (73%), spiramicin, and tilmicosin (both at 100%) have been found in Italy (Donazzolo et al., 2017).

This fact explains the high degree of similarity in PFGE (SC2) or phenotypical resistance patterns (SuSTeDo) found in the strains from these places. The other estate from cluster A, F10, was located 44 km away from F4 and F9 but still in the same region. As mentioned above, F10 is a \u201chunting farm\u201d that provides animals to other places and implements sanitary measures including antibiotics administration. F10 shared identical phenotypical resistance pattern with F4 and F9 but displayed the PFGE profile SC1. It should be mentioned that SC1 profile also appeared in F4 a few years later after the first outbreak was declared in this estate (Isolate R144), clearly supporting the hypothesis of genetic transfer between estates of this cluster. Regarding to cluster B, most of its isolates were classified into SC4. All the strains from this subgroup (SC4) lacked the flagellar antigen and presented the Kunzendorf variant. Besides, its phenotypical resistance pattern was much more limited than that from cluster A. Unlike SC4, strains from SC3 presented the flagellar antigen and showed different resistant patterns (genotypical and phenotypical) which could be due to a different evolution in their ecological niches, acquiring distinct resistances. Despite the high degree of similarity in cluster B (97%), there was no apparent geographical relation between the locations of the isolates in this group. This remarkable dispersion could be due to the ability of the strains of Salmonella to persist for long periods of time in asymptomatic carriers, as it was previously demonstrated in Germany (Methner et al., 2010). Such persistence would explain the distance between isolates as well as the time between different cases.",

On the other hand, our results points to a possible relation between human intervention and the presence of higher rates of antibiotic resistance, as it has been previously reported in different wild mammals (Allen et al., 2010). In order to avoid future difficulties with the productive management of wild boars as well as to reduce the human impact on their environment, it is necessary to re\u2010evaluate the management methods applied on this species.
