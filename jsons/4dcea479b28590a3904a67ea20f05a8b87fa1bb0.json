Their paper, which we discuss here, is structured around three \"toy protocols\" for the design of an app which can maximise the utility of contact tracing information while minimising the more general risk to privacy. On this basis, the paper proceeds to introduce eight questions against which they should be assessed. The questions raised and the protocols proposed effectively amount to the creation of a game with different categories of players able to make different moves. It is therefore possible to analyse the model in terms of optimal game design.",

The second difference, however, is that protocol 2 also sends its full history of identifier encounters to the authority, whereas article 3 only sends its identifier change record.

For example, does it reduce or increase the knowledge of the authority about trajectories/social graphs of either group?

Infected users have a duty to maximise knowledge about their contacts, but the right not to have any further information about them disclosed. (As we have seen, the right of the infected might outweigh that of the non-infected on the grounds of the risk of vigilantism, whereas it might also be thought to be outweighed because of the possible culpability of infection given the level of public knowledge [Rosand et al. 2020] . This is clearly a value, not a pure design, issue.) The authority has the right (and possibly duty) to be as informed as possible about the pattern of spread of the epidemic, but it should be prevented from acquiring (and indeed retaining) any more than the essential information about the users under its jurisdiction. The adversary has no rights in this context and is simply a threat to be minimised.",
