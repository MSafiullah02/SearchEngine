An analysis of the 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus in west Africa showed that the indirect effects of the outbreak were more severe than the outbreak itself.4 Although mortality rates for COVID-19 appear to be low in children and in women of reproductive age,5 these groups might be disproportionately affected by the disruption of routine health services, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). With this in mind, we sought to quantify the potential indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality.",

Global organisations have called for maintaining routine health services during the pandemic; however, the potential indirect effects on mortality from maternal and child health service disruption have not been quantified. Previous infectious disease outbreaks indirectly resulted in increases in mortality caused by reductions in the provision and use of routine health services. Notably, the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic resulted in a 27\u00b76 percentage point decrease in service use and 44\u00b73 percentage point decrease in inpatient services in high-incidence areas of west Africa. During the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a 23\u00b79% reduction in ambulatory care and a 35\u00b72% reduction in inpatient care was observed in Taiwan. Similar indirect effects are plausible as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and control efforts.\nAdded value of this study\nWe quantified the potential indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and control efforts on reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health in 118 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) using the Lives Saved Tool. We modelled the effects on maternal and under-5 mortality of three outbreak scenarios and attributed the excess mortality to reductions in specific interventions or increases in risk factors. Our analysis shows that, if the COVID-19 pandemic results in widespread disruption to health systems, LMICs can expect to see substantial increases in maternal and child deaths. Childbirth care and child curative services are particularly vulnerable to disruption and would account for the greatest number of additional maternal and child deaths.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur analysis does not aim to predict the trajectory of the pandemic response in LMICs. Quantification of the indirect effects of the pandemic is intended to serve as a benchmark for policy makers. The choices that governments make in responding to the pandemic will have consequences for the health and livelihoods of populations. In the context of these choices, our estimates highlight the need to consider how to mitigate the effect of health system disruptions and movement restrictions on maternal and child health. Our analysis provides a framework that policy makers can use to prioritise interventions and quantify the secondary effects of resource allocation and control measures, to inform decisions around health system continuity and stop-gap measures during and following the pandemic.\n",

The low buying power of LMICs and their lack of infrastructure for domestic production are disadvantageous in ensuring a steady supply chain. Global reserves and international procurement mechanisms for essential RMNCH medicines could mitigate shortages;16 however, interruptions in global transport could affect these channels. In addition, local efforts to contain COVID-19 are likely to negatively impact domestic medical supply chains.",

This high coverage grants herd protection for some vaccine-preventable diseases, attenuating the immediate effects of coverage declines on mortality. However, even short gaps in vaccination coverage can result in overall declines in population coverage, and catch-up campaigns should be prioritised in the aftermath of the pandemic.15\n",

As life returns to normal, countries should advance resilient health systems and reinvigorate demand for routine care. The longer that coverage reductions continue, the more lives will be lost.

We should not delay in restoring health services as soon as possible if we are to minimise the lasting impact of otherwise temporary disruptions.",

There is not yet reliable empirical data for the effect of the pandemic on health service provision or utilisation. Moreover, our understanding of what might be possible is based largely on experiences in high-income countries; the effects of the pandemic in LMICs, and the response to it, will probably be different.29 For all these reasons, our results are intended to help understand the potential magnitude of the effect, not to offer exact or even approximate numbers.",

A more complex analysis might attempt to model these upstream factors. Similarly, a comprehensive analysis would consider in more detail the long-term effect of temporary reductions in vaccine coverage (assuming no catch-up campaigns), the long-term effect of fertility increases due to temporary reductions in contraceptive prevalence, and the additional deaths during a post-pandemic period in which coverage is returning to baseline. LiST does not capture individual infectious disease dynamics and therefore does not reflect the potential effects of secondary outbreaks in the absence of preventive interventions (eg, localised measles outbreaks due to a gap in measles vaccination), as modelled in other analyses.30 In general, we expect the pandemic to affect the health of women and children in more ways than we have captured, not fewer, including through causal pathways unknown to us now. If our estimates are overly conservative, they still highlight the need to consider maternal and child health amid the pandemic and the consequences at stake.",
