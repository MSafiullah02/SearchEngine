It is a prevalent disease, both in the USA and globally. According to the large population-based Multinational Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (MAPP) survey, the prevalence of psoriasis ranges from 1.4% in Spain to 3.3% in Canada, with an overall prevalence of 1.9%. The prevalence in the USA is slightly higher than the average at 2.2% [1]. Worldwide, the prevalence has been found to vary both geographically and among different ethnic groups within the same region and is overall reported at higher rates in locations distant from the equator [2, 3].",

However, the disease onset appears to follow a bimodal distribution, peaking around 20\u201330 years of age and again around 50\u201360 years of age [4]. A family history of the disease is common. Approximately 30% of patients have a first-degree relative with psoriasis, and the risk of psoriasis increases with the number of affected relatives a patient has [5]. Some studies suggest that this bimodal distribution represents two distinct forms of psoriasis; compared to patients whose psoriasis presents later in life, patients with early onset psoriasis are much more likely to possess a genetic marker that is highly associated with psoriasis and to have a parent with psoriasis. Earlier onset psoriasis is also associated with more severe disease [4]. In most cases, the disease waxes and wanes throughout a patient\u2019s life, and spontaneous remission without treatment is unlikely [6].",

Despite this, nearly half of psoriasis patients had not seen a physician in the past year, and many were on either no treatment or topical therapy alone. One of the reasons for this undertreatment was lack of tolerability or efficacy of available oral or biologic agents [1].

Psoriatic arthritis typically occurs in patients who have had preexisting skin findings of psoriasis for 5\u201312 years; however, approximately 20% of patients will present with joint symptoms first [1, 11]. The most common presentation of psoriatic arthritis is polyarticular peripheral arthritis but can vary widely with peripheral and/or axial, monoarticular, or polyarticular patterns. The severity of psoriatic arthritis can also vary drastically among individuals but does not necessarily correlate with the severity of skin findings. At its most severe, the arthritis can be erosive and deforming (arthritis mutilans) [11]. Even among psoriasis patients without a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, 50% report joint pain [10]. Given the high prevalence and disease burden of psoriatic arthritis, it is important to screen for arthritis symptoms in every patient with psoriasis at each visit [11].",

However, psoriasis patients have been found to have an increased risk of myocardial infarction even after controlling for these cardiovascular risk factors, signifying that psoriasis itself may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The risk of cardiovascular disease appears to be highest in patients with more severe psoriasis at a younger age [15, 16].

Medications implicated in the induction and exacerbation of psoriasis include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), antimalarials, lithium, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [20\u201322]. Despite the association with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, a population-based case-control study found that beta-blockers and other anti-hypertensives are not associated with psoriasis [23].

Early genetic linkage studies identified a major genetic determinant of psoriasis in the susceptibility-1 locus (PSORS1) of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Later, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw6 was identified as the diseased allele at PSORS1 [26]. In recent years, genome-wide association studies have identified 63 genes that account for approximately 28% of the heritability of psoriasis. These genes include those of inflammatory interleukins and immune mediators [27]. In particular, a review of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses from multiple studies has shown an association between psoriasis and the loci for the T-helper type 2 (Th2) pathway (including interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-13), the T-helper type 17 (Th17) pathway (including subsets of IL-12 and IL-23), innate immune signaling pathways for nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and interferons (IFN), and adaptive immune pathways involving CD8 T cells [28].",

This has been supported by the genetic studies mentioned above. Abnormal activation of inflammatory mediators from the innate and adaptive immune systems has been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Involved cells include keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells, and important inflammatory mediators include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-17, IL-12, and IL-23 [30]. Recent advances in understanding the underlying inflammatory mechanisms have been pivotal in the development of new and more efficacious targeted therapies such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and/or -23, and IL-17 inhibitors.",

This disease is characterized by recurrent eruptions of sterile pustules on the palmar and plantar surfaces [34] (Figs. 1.11 and 1.12). Although this form is not life-threatening as in generalized pustular psoriasis, it is a debilitating condition with high morbidity, as patients can have severe pain. Patients with psoriasis on the hands and feet have been found to have a worse quality of life than patients with extensive involvement on the trunk [41, 42]. Palmoplantar pustulosis typically presents between 30 and 40 years of age, and the palmar lesions typically precede plantar involvement by a few months [43]. Notably, the majority of patients are female, with a female to male ratio of 9:1. Palmoplantar pustulosis is also highly associated with smoking with 95% of patients having a previous or current smoking history [17]. Roughly 25% of palmoplantar psoriasis\npatients will also have a diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis, although genetic studies indicate that they are distinct entities [25].\n\n",

Fissuring and superimposed bacterial or fungal infections may occur.

Generalized pustular psoriasis may be mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) given the widespread erythema and desquamation [37]. Another important differential diagnosis is that of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a febrile drug eruption also characterized by small sterile pustules on an erythematous base. The short latency period between drug administration and the skin reaction can help differentiate this from pustular psoriasis. Biopsy findings can also be helpful [35].

The rete ridges display increased thickening toward the tips , resulting in a club-like appearance (Fig. 1.18). The capillaries of the interdigitating dermal papillae will be dilated and tortuous (Fig. 1.19). Fine fibrillary collagen bundles can also be seen in the papillae. The suprapapillary plate is thinned, particularly in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum [45]. Terminal differentiation begins in the granular cell layer of the epidermis, which is absent in the areas subajacent to the observed parakeratosis. The stratum corneum therefore develops from keratinocytes that have not undergone normal differentiation, leading to the finding of parakeratosis (aberrant retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum) [45, 52] (Fig. 1.20). Orthokeratosis (hyperkeratosis without parakeratosis) is also often seen, alternating with areas of parakeratosis . Another finding related to hyperproliferation includes increased mitoses in the basal and suprabasal layer [45]. A mononuclear leukocytic infiltrate can be seen in the epidermis and dermis consisting of predominately lymphocytes [51].\n\n\n",
