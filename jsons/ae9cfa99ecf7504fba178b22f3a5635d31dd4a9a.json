            "text": "M. pneumoniae is also known to trigger acute asthmatic exacerbations. 5-7 M. pneumoniae has been linked to the development of chronic infections, and may contribute to the persistence and severity of asthmatic symptoms. 8 Furthermore, these persistent infections can result in decreased expiratory flow rates and increased airway hyperresponsiveness in individuals without asthma, consistent with a role for M. pneumoniae as an asthmatic trigger. 9 Similar effects were observed in a murine study of MP, in which pulmonary structural abnormalities suggestive of airway hyperreactivity, airway obstruction, and histological inflammation were more frequent 1 to 2 years after re-Purpose: Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) is associated with the exacerbation, timing, and onset of asthma. The goal of this study was to elucidate the impact of MP on eosinophil-related hyper-reactive amplification in atopic children. Methods: We studied 48 patients with MP (26 atopic, 22 non-atopic), between 3 and 12 years of age. Serial changes in blood eosinophil counts, serum interleukin-5 (IL-5), and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured in atopic and non-atopic children with MP upon admission, recovery, and at 2 months post-recovery. Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; eosinophil counts were measured using an autoanalyzer. Results: Serial changes in serum IL-5, ECP, and total eosinophil counts were significantly higher in atopic patients, relative to non-atopic controls (P\u22640.001). Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were significantly higher in atopic patients at all three time points tested, while eosinophil counts were higher in the clinical recovery and follow-up phases, but not in the acute phase. Furthermore, among atopic patients, serum ECP levels were significantly higher in the recovery and follow-up phases than in the acute phase. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated significant differences in eosinophil counts, serum IL-5, and serum ECP levels between atopic and non-atopic children with MP at admission, recovery, and 2 months after clinical recovery. These outcomes are suggestive of eosinophil-related hyperreactivity in atopic children, with this status maintained for at least 2 months after MP.",

            "text": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae has long been recognized as a cause of primary atypical pneumonia, particularly among children. This microorganism accounts for 7 to 40% of all community-acquired pneumonias in children 3 to 15 years of age, with a lower incidence in children under the age of 3 years. Other respiratory illnesses, including tracheobronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pharyngitis, sinusitis, croup, and bronchiolitis have also been associated with M. pneumoniae. In contrast to the acute, short-lived epidemics of some respiratory viral agents, M. pneumoniae is endemic to large communities, with outbreaks occurring every 4 to 7 years. [1] [2] [3] According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent outbreak of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) in Korea lasted from late summer 2010 to the fall of 2011, with peak positivity rates in community-acquired pneumonia ranging from 23.6% in October 2010 to 62.5% in September 2011. 4 In addition to its role as a cause of community-acquired pneuhttp://e-aair.org spiratory M. pneumoniae infection. 10 This suggests that mediators associated with airway hyperreactivity could provide information regarding the cause of these structural abnormalities after M. pneumoniae respiratory infection. Although clinical manifestations of pneumonia disappear within a few months following recovery from an M. pneumoniae infection, mediators of airway hyperreactivity may continue to be released into the circulation long after the infection has been cleared. Allergic reactions are characterized by an infiltration of T helper type 2 (Th2) cells into affected tissues. Upon exposure to an allergen, these cells expand rapidly, and begin secreting large amounts of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, resulting in IgE synthesis and eosinophilia. IL-5 is a potent mediator of eosinophil activation, and along with eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), plays a key role in airway hyperresponsiveness. 11 Children with acute M. pneumoniae infection and wheezing exhibited higher serum IL-5 concentrations than those with asymptomatic acute infection without wheezing, suggesting the association of IL-5 with airway hyperresponsiveness. 12 Similar increases in serum IL-5 levels have also been seen in children with atopic MP. 13 Furthermore, eosinophilia has been reported in up to 44% of children with M. pneumoniae infections, suggesting that potent Th2-like immune responses are common in MP. Taken together, these and other studies suggest a mechanism by which activated eosinophils in the airway undergo degranulation leading to injury of the bronchial epithelium, and induction of bronchial hyperreactivity. 14, 15 In addition to IL-5, ECP is also a key mediator of eosinophil activation. Yamashita and colleagues reported that the serum concentrations of ECP in children with M. pneumoniae infections were higher than those of healthy controls. These elevated ECP levels may be associated with damage to the respiratory epithelium and accelerated hypersensitivity in the respiratory system, resulting in a chronic, persistent cough that can last several months. 16, 17 The aim of this study was to investigate serial changes in blood eosinophil counts, serum IL-5, and serum ECP levels in atopic and non-atopic children with MP at admission, recovery, and 2 months after recovery. These findings should help to elucidate the role of MP in eosinophil-related hyperreactive amplification in atopic children.",

M. pneumoniae has been shown to trigger wheezing by means of increased IL-5 secretion in subjects predisposed to asthma, whether as a result of their genetic background, or through previous events that have primed their immune system and lungs. 12 Similar results were reported by Choi et al. 25 who identified elevated levels of serum IL-5, VEGF, and ECP, along with increase blood eosinophil counts in children with wheezing during acute MP. These findings are consistent with the results described here, which showed higher levels of serum IL-5, ECP, and eosinophil counts, in atopic children with acute MP.",

Serial increases in all three parameters persisted for at least 2 months after resolution of pneumonia. These data suggest a long-term effect of M. pneumoniae infection on allergic inflammation, with significant implications for the treatment of atopic asthma. We also focused on the role of eosinophil activation in allergic inflammation due to M. pneumoniae infection. Although antimycoplasma antibody titers had decreased by 2 months postrecovery, serum IL-5, ECP, and eosinophil counts in atopic children with MP gradually increased between the acute, recovery, and follow-up phases of the disease at levels significantly higher than that of non-atopic controls. Furthermore, serum ECP levels in atopic children were significantly higher in the recovery and follow-up phases, as compared with the acute phase of disease. This effect was unique to ECP, with other parameters showing no statistically significant differences among time points. These data imply that activated eosinophils, represented by ECP, may contribute to the allergic inflammatory seen in atopic children with MP.",
