These devices have become almost indispensable elements in the fabric of social life. Health care workers (HCWs) use these devices extensively in daily life and at work. Mobile phones have increased the speed of communication and contact within health care institutions.(1,2,6\u20139)",

Physicians were not included in the study because they did not wish to participate. The mobile phones were also categorized according to whether the HCWs worked in the intensive care unit (ICU). Microbiological cultures were taken from mobile phones on Wednesday at about 15:00 hr by two physicians who were blind to the HCWs. Each HCW was asked two questions when the microbiological cultures were taken: (1) Do you ever clean your mobile phone with antiseptic wipes? (2) Do other individuals outside the hospital (e.g., family members such as children and the elderly) use your mobile phone? HCWs who did not want to participate in the study were excluded. The use of mobile phones by HCWs has not been limited or banned in our hospital.",

Conventional methods such as the morphological appearance of the colonies, Gram stain, coagulase test, and oxidase and catalase reactions were used.
