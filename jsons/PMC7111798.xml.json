Extensive human worldwide travel, and contact with animals [1], [2], contribute to the SARS problem. Early detection and identification of SARS coronavirus (CoV)-infected patients, and actions to prevent transmission, are absolutely critical in prevention of another SARS outbreak [1], [3]. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and real-time PCR-based diagnostic tests for SARS have been valuable for early identification of infections, they are still laborious and expensive and require skilled personnel [3], [4], [5]. Therefore, in terms of public health measures in response to epidemics, a rapid recognition of emerging SARS infections urgently requires new diagnostic tools that are portable, sensitive, and easy to use, to assure (as much as possible) \u201cin-field\u201d detection.",

Such sensors offer several advantages: there is no need for labeling; real-time detection is possible; curtailment of non-specific binding is achievable; and detection of nanomolar concentrations of proteins of molecular weights larger than 180 Da is possible [6], [7]. In principle, a surface plasmon oscillation is a localized wave that propagates along the interface between the gold film and the ambient medium and is very sensitive to changes in the refractive index near the gold surface when biomolecules bind to that surface [7], [8].",

Many protein immobilization techniques, based on both physical adsorption and covalent linkage, have been developed in the past few years [9]. However, the physical attachment to surface is likely to be heterogeneous, weak, and randomly oriented, and the covalent attachment also can lead to random immobilization of proteins, resulting in a reduction of biological activity. Such techniques are cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore, a simple method to immobilize target proteins, with retention of biological activity, is urgently required.",

Interestingly, none of these 14 amino acid residues is cysteine, generally considered to form a thiol linkage with gold [11], thus offering a new way of interaction between proteins and gold surfaces. Polar side-chains of peptides rich in serine and threonine seem to interact with the gold surface. The adsorption kinetics of GBP onto the gold surface were explored using SPR spectroscopy [12]. Furthermore, proteins and peptides of interest can be fused to the GBP for immobilization on the gold surface [13]. These findings led us to develop protein immobilizations of biological sensors using GBP as a fusion partner.",

Oligonucleotides encoding the SARS-CoV envelope protein were synthesized by design of gene sequence from the envelope amino acid sequence, employing the DNAWorks program [14]. The sequence encoding the SARS-CoV envelope protein was obtained from GenBank (accession number AY274119.3). The relevant gene was located from base pairs 26,117\u201326,347 in the SARS genomic sequence, and encoded 76 amino acids [1]. The codon frequency was chosen to represent Escherichia coli class II, and the following parameters were employed: maximum oligonucleotide length, 50 nt; annealing temperature, 58 \u00b0C; codon frequency threshold, 50; number of solutions, 50. Synthetic assembly of the intact envelope gene using component oligonucleotides was performed with a single-step assembly protocol [15]. We describe the approach only in general. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments for gene assembly were carried out under the following cycling conditions: initial denaturing step at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min to avoid any possible mispriming; 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s; annealing at various temperatures (depending on the melting temperatures indicated by the DNAWorks program); extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. For gene amplification, 1 \u03bcL of the mixture from the gene assembly reaction was used as a template, with the outermost oligonucleotides used as primers. As in a previous report [2], PCR experiments were performed using a Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and high-fidelity Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) for the cloning of the SARS-CoV envelope gene in E. coli. All DNA manipulations including restriction digestion, ligation, and agarose gel electrophoresis, were standard procedures [16]. The DNA sequence of the clone was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing (ABI Prism 377, PerkinElmer, Grove, IL, USA).",

However, such fabrications require surface chemical modifications involving reactive functional groups or charged materials. Uniformly oriented immobilization of the GBP-E-SCVme fusion protein onto the gold chip was easily achieved without any surface chemical modification because of the gold binding property of the protein. To examine whether protein monolayers and protein molecular interactions might develop on the gold chip surface, we analyzed, at the molecular level, alterations in surface morphologies caused by sequential binding of GBP-E-SCVme and anti-SCVme antibodies onto a gold surface, employing high-resolution AFM analysis. After the specific immobilization of the GBP-E-SCVme (100 \u03bcg mL\u22121) onto the gold-micropatterned surface, the subsequent binding of anti-SCVme antibodies (100 \u03bcg mL\u22121) onto the GBP-E-SCVme layer was observed (Fig. 2\n). GFP has a 4.2 nm long cylindrical structure with a MW of \u223c27 kDa [19]. As GBP-E-SCVme fusion protein has a MW of \u223c57 kDa, the length of GBP-E-SCVme can be estimated to be \u223c8.87 nm. The line profile of the GBP-E-SCVme bound onto the micropatterned gold surface was measured as approximately 8.2 nm as a height difference from the gold surface (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). The height difference after binding with anti-SCVme antibodies was about 12.8 nm, which shows specific interaction of antibodies with the monolayer of GBP-E-SCVme immobilized onto the gold substrate (Fig. 2(b) and (c)). Furthermore, roughness increases caused by sequential binding of GBP-E-SCVme and anti-SCVme onto the gold surface were observed with different surface properties. Three-dimensional images show distinct well-shaped and well-defined peaks on the gold surface, and the gradual rise in peak numbers of Fig. 3(b) and (c) also indicates an increase in binding of biomolecules, suggesting that the GBP-E-SCVme and anti-SCVme antibodies were sequentially and specifically immobilized on the gold surface as ordered monolayers with a uniform thickness.",

The dynamic and specific binding of GBP-E-SCVme onto the SPR gold chip was directly monitored in real-time. A sharp increase in the SPR signal up to about 3060 RU was observed upon introducing GBP-E-SCVme solution onto the chip surface, and about 98% of the GBP-E-SCVme remained to the surface even after washing with PBS, which showed that most of the fusion protein was strongly immobilized onto the chip surface. The 3000 RU value obtained implies that about 3 ng of GBP-E-SCVme was immobilized onto a gold surface area of 1 mm2. One RU is determined as 0.0001\u00b0 of resonance angle shift and equivalent to a mass change of the 1 pg mm\u22122 on the sensor surface [20], [21]. However, the SPR signal of 3057 RU generated from the binding of E-SCVme (control) onto the chip surface immediately decreased up to around 50% on rinsing with PBS, indicating that about 50% of E-SCVme was non-specifically bound to the gold surface. Positive surface charges of the amine groups in E-SCVme proteins may be irregularly coupled with negative charges of the gold surface by electrostatic force [22], [23]. This showed that the electrostatic binding force was even weaker than the specific binding between GBP and the gold surface, and that GBP-E-SCVme fusion proteins could be strongly immobilized onto the gold surface by the GBP domain. Previous work also reported that the binding of GBP onto the gold surface is stronger than that of self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiol molecules due to the lower standard Gibbs free energy of GBP [12]. Therefore, it is clear that strong binding or adsorption of GBP-fusion protein onto the SPR chip can assist in studies on various protein\u2013protein interactions.",

Fig. 4(b) shows the interaction between the GBP-E-SCVme layer and subsequent applied anti-SCVme. When anti-SCVme was permitted to flow over the GBP-E-SCVme layer, SPR signals increased until the concentration of GBP-E-SCVme reached to 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121, but they began to decrease as the concentration was over 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121. Less than 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121, 1 and 5 \u03bcg mL\u22121 concentrations of GBP-E-SCVme resulted in low levels of the fusion protein immobilized on the gold surface, resulting in insufficient interaction between GBP-E-SCVme and anti-SCVme. Moreover, lower signals of 680 and 480 RU compared to that (900 RU) observed at the concentration of 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121 GBP-E-SCVme were obtained at 25 and 50 \u03bcg mL\u22121 concentrations, respectively, because the GBP-E-SCVme was densely immobilized on the surface and thus steric hindrance between closely packed GBP-E-SCVme molecules may have occurred. These results indicate that the best packing density of GBP-E-SCVme was obtained using a 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121 solution concentration. This particular packing density of the GBP-E-SCVme likely reduced steric hindrance, provided sufficient binding sites for anti-SCVme antibody, and avoided loss of biological activity. Ko et al. [24], [25] have shown similar trends that insufficiently or densely immobilized antibodies on sensing surfaces can lead to a reduced detection signal, and Kolotilov et al. [26] also showed that a nanoparticle with immobilized protein A could not anchor sufficient IgG molecules to its surface due to steric hindrances.

As expected, little SPR responses of 5.8 and 6.7 RU were observed by the non-specific binding of mouse IgG at 1 and 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121, respectively. These SPR responses were much lower than those (43 and 142 RU) obtained when the anti-SCVme of 1 and 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121 concentrations, respectively, were used. Also, the slight difference between SPR signals of 5.8 and 6.7 RU means that the binding of mouse IgG was independent of concentration since it was only a negative control. It means that the GBP-E-SCVme-coated SPR chip selectively detects anti-SCVme antibodies.",

However, low detection limit is normally the signal that is three times higher than the background signal [27], [28]. The SPR signal of 25.2 RU at the anti-SCVme concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg mL\u22121 meets this requirement. Therefore, it was determined that the LOD of the GBP-E-SCVme immobilized sensor chip for detection of anti-SCVme in PBS was 0.2 \u03bcg mL\u22121. It is considered that the best packing density of GBP-E-SCVme fusion proteins used in fabrication of the sensor chip may contribute to this low LOD. These results show that development of a sensitive and selective immunoassay system for SARS diagnosis was possible using a GBP-E-SCVme fusion protein-immobilized SPR chip.",

The SPRi difference images produced by subtracting a reference image from a post-binding image contribute to visual confirmation of binding [29], [30]. The gold-micropatterned chip was cleaned for 5 min in piranha solution and next washed with distilled water. After drying under nitrogen, the chip sequentially bound GBP-E-SCVme fusion proteins and anti-SCVme antibodies. The GBP-E-SCVme fusion proteins (from a 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 solution) were immobilized onto the gold-micropatterned chip by dipping for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C. After the GBP-E-SCVme-treated chip was washed with distilled water and dried under nitrogen, the chip was dipped into a solution of anti-SCVme (100 \u03bcg mL\u22121) for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C. Following washing and drying, the prepared chip was analyzed. The brighter spots indicate binding of the target proteins onto gold substrates, because reflectivity increases when binding occurs. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the brighter spots shown in samples (ii) and (iii) (compared to sample (i)) indicate the successive binding of GBP-E-SCVme and anti-SCVme antibodies onto the gold micropatterns. The brighter spots indicate the binding of target proteins onto gold substrates. Moreover, spot brightness is shown as spot intensity in Fig. 6(b). The spot intensity increased to 11.2 RU when GBP-E-SCVme was specifically bound to a gold-patterned chip showing background spot intensities of 4.6 RU, and subsequent binding of anti-SCVme to the resulting GBP-E-SCVme layer yielded a stronger spot intensity of 32.8 RU. These SPRi images show that the binding of GBP-E-SCVme, through the GBP domain, onto the gold substrate, was highly specific, and the fusion protein remained functional for further specific interaction between the SCVme domain and anti-SCVme, after immobilization onto the gold surface.",

Therefore, in this study, a rapid diagnostic method of SARS was developed using a new strategy for effective immobilization of a recognition element onto an SPR gold sensor chip. The recognition element (SCVme) for detecting anti-SCVme was genetically fused to GBP. SPR analysis demonstrated that the fusion proteins were directly and simply self-immobilized onto the gold chip surface via the GBP domain which has a strong gold binding affinity, without surface modifications. The fusion protein-coated SPR chip offers a stable and specific sensing platform maintaining its anti-SCVme binding activity. Moreover, AFM analyses demonstrated specific binding of the fusion protein onto the gold surface and subsequent binding of anti-SCVme to the SCVme domain of the fusion protein layer. Using the fusion protein described here as an anchoring and recognition element, the SPR chip for rapid diagnosis of SARS infections was easily constructed and contributed to the sensitive and selective detection of anti-SCVme within 10 min. In future study, the system needs to be combined with a signal-enhancing method to obtain a more sensitive detection response. Furthermore, GBP-fusion proteins with other functional groups may open an avenue for the development of various gold substrate-based biosensor systems.",
