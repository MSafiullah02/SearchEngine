Testing recommendation for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients planned for surgery -continuing the service and 'suppressing' the pandemic. Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2020 Apr 13 pii: S0266-4356(20)30164-9. To the Editor, A recent publication by M.A. Al-Muharraqi recommends a COVID-19 testing protocol which involves both PCR and antibody testing for planned crucial head and neck surgical patients. [1] Using the flowchart, surgery would proceed with the exception of where a positive PCR result is obtained in which case the patient would be allowed to recover from the illness and surgery postponed. We solely implemented a PCR testing strategy for all pre-operative elective surgical patients in our institution on 31st March. Patients are risk-assessed for the urgency of their planned operation and those that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission Not relevant for this paper Conflict of Interest No conflicts of interest to declare J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Br advised to 'cocoon' or minimise all interaction between them and others, a low positivity rate was expected. It is likely that COVID-19 will be a public health issue for the foreseeable future and therefore surgeons will have to develop strategies to manage this risk. As only emergency and urgent surgeries are currently taking place, now is the optimal time to hone these strategies. Whilst we observed a low positivity rate with our pre-operative testing strategy employing PCR alone, we would expect this figure to increase as public health restrictions ease. The challenges and limitations of antibody testing are well described and therefore we chose not to include this testing method in our pre-operative screening programme. [3] As highly sensitive molecular point-of-care tests become increasingly available, pre-operative testing can become even more streamlined allowing for testing on the day of the planned procedure to provide maximum reassurance of a negative COVID status at the time of the procedure.",
