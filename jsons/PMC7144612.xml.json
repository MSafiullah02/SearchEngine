In order to determine the times required for full airflow exchange in each treatment vault, these values were either directly measured by facilities staff or estimated using the range of minimum to maximum flow rates from the room design specifications to extrapolate clearance levels. Table 2\nsummarizes the relevant airflow exchange times for the treatment vaults across our clinical sites. We used these data to select treatment vaults that were most appropriate for treating COVID+/PUI. For example, in review of data for the East Baltimore site, full airflow exchange times for the vaults of our most versatile linear accelerators ranged from 41.1 to 71.3 minutes; thus, we selected the vault with the shortest exchange time for a treating future COVID+/PUI patient.",
