            "text": "Young people with complex support needs frequently experience multiple intersecting forms of disadvantage including experiences of violence, abuse and neglect, housing instability and homelessness, problematic substance use, exclusion from education, and contact with the criminal justice system. Many of these young people have mental health, cognitive disability and/or other health issues that also impact on their lives. These young people need to navigate multiple, diverse, and often difficult transitions between services, adding to the existing chaos in their lives. This article explores the experiences of young people with complex support needs in transition, specifically young people's viewpoints and experiences of supports they receive from paid professionals. This qualitative study used body mapping research methods and in-depth interviews with 38 young people aged 16 to 26 years in three Australian states. Helpful and trusting paid relationships could serve as an anchor to young people during complex transitions and other highly turbulent life periods. These relationships were contingent on a deep and non-judgmental knowing of the young person, contributed constructive outcomes and stability in young people's lives, and for some young people, had 'life-saving' effects. These findings present opportunities and challenges for policymakers and practitioners to balance the tensions between authentic relationship-based work with young people and risk-averse, economically-driven imperatives in contemporary youth service provision.",

            "text": "The concept of 'youth transition' has great currency in social science research and in policy and service provision targeted at youth (Stor\u00f8, 2017; Strnadova & Cumming, 2016) . Transition can broadly be defined as a change in status or role of an individual, which can potentially occur over a multitude of contexts, including moving between or within social structures and across the life course (Harms, 2010; Strnadova & Cumming, 2016) . Normative understandings of youth transition have been contested during the last few decades, with recognition that changes such as the transition to adulthood can vary according to cultural and social contexts (Stor\u00f8, 2017) , and are seldom linear or uni-dimensional (te Riele, 2004) . Despite these shifts in thinking around transition, much of the research on youth transition is sector or domain-specific, or focuses on singular transitions, such as leaving out-of-home care (Sulimani-Aidan, 2017) , the transition to independent living arrangements (Bramsen, Kuiper, Willemse, & Cardol, 2019) , or finding employment (Stafford, Marston, Chamorro-Koc, Beatson, & Drennan, 2017) . Such studies can explore issues within particular contexts or timeframes in-depth, but fail to examine the interconnectedness and overlaps of transitions . Adopting a uniform and simplistic framework for understanding change is especially problematic for young people with complex support needs whose experience is likely to transcend service boundaries and singular understandings of transition; and who experience multiple and interlocking disadvantage across the life course (Ellem, Baidawi, Dowse, & Smith, 2019) .",

Experiences of transition for young people with complex support needs are frequently far from normative. These young people must often navigate a plethora of multi-faceted transitions which can include experiences of violence (Lamb, Humphreys, & Hegarty, 2018) ; rejection and exclusion from formal education and other services (Paget et al., 2018) ; criminalization at an early age and frequent contact with police (Ellem & Richards, 2018) ; the loss of essential resources such as housing and/or income (Couch, 2017; Mott, Keller, Britt-Rankin, & Ball, 2018) ; and breakdowns in informal supports such as removal from families of origin, continual relocations resulting in instability and the loss of supportive relationships (Jakobsen & Christiansen, 2011; Atwool, 2016) .",

Formal services cut across several sectors including housing, income support, mental health and disability services. The relationships that young people develop with workers within such contexts have the potential to restore young people's sense of worth and competence or exacerbate disadvantage (Sandu, 2019) . In some service contexts, such as child protection and youth justice, young people enter service-user/worker relationships as involuntary clients, where the professional has a role in governing the young person's behaviour and life circumstances. These relationships may be actively resisted by young people as a strategy to gain some agency in their situation (Munford & Sanders, 2017) . All of these service systems may contribute to additional instability as young people move from one service to another and one professional relationship to another (Smyth, 2017) . Services which aim to assist the young person may fail to provide sustained support, or place conditions on receiving support that a young person cannot meet Smyth, 2017) .",

A service can become relationally oriented when primacy is given to the common humanity between service users and professionals, and an egalitarian approach is taken to achieve positive outcomes for clients (Turney, 2012) . A helpful client-worker connection enables clients to take control of their circumstances (Ellem, 2019) , and results in learning and personal growth (Ellem, O'Connor, Wilson, & Williams, 2013; Munford & Sanders, 2017) . When a person's ontological need for relationship is addressed, this can be more effective at delivering outcomes than professionalised and distanced therapies and interventions (O'Leary, Tsui, & Ruch, 2013; Parr, 2016) . While there exists a substantial body of research on the value and effectiveness of relationship-based approaches to working with high-risk young people and young people with complex support needs (for example, Almqvist & Lassinantti, 2017; Mason, 2012) , attaining genuine insights from young people themselves about service relationships has been a complex endeavour (Harder, Knorth, & Kalverboer, 2013) . Many of the challenges faced by practitioners in building rapport with young people with complex support needs are also applicable to the research context. This group are likely to have previous experiences of adult professionals betraying their confidences, and may be distrustful of a relative stranger wanting to engage them in research (Vander Laenen, 2009 ). In addition, researchers may have their own instrumental and strategic motivations for engaging young people in research processes that do not necessarily align with the young person's views (van Bijleveld, Dedding, & Bunders-Aelen, 2014) .",

This paper reports on research that has taken a middle ground on the co-construction of knowledge regarding relationshipbased practice. The study has elicited the views of young people with complex support needs through a combination of the more traditional qualitative research method of semistructured interviews and the multi-modal, arts-based method of body mapping. By adopting both approaches, this study has facilitated the involvement of a diverse group of young people, with varying levels of discursive abilities, and a wide variety of service and life experiences. The findings are part of a larger Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage project, \"Lost in Transition\", aimed at investigating the transition support needs of young people with complex support needs from the young people's standpoint, service provider standpoint, and policy context. Based at the University of New South Wales, the project involved a partnership between academics in NSW, Queensland (University of Queensland), and Victoria (Monash University and Latrobe University), as well as partner organisations in each of the three states.",

The design was informed by an advisory group of young people with complex support needs who recommended that participants be provided with a range of options for participation including: group or one-on-one participation; telling their story in different ways (through body mapping, lifeline mapping, or an interview); having a support person present; and telling their whole life story or focussing on one personally significant transition. By using multiple methods, the researchers were able to explore the lived experiences of transition in both structured ways via in-depth interviews, and in a more flexible and intuitive manner via body mapping. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval HC16950), with expedited approval provided by The University of Queensland, Monash University, and La Trobe University.",

The age range was adjusted for body mapping in consultation with service providers and partners who felt that the narrower age range would not facilitate access to certain groups of young people located in rural areas or who lived with an intellectual disability. These age ranges aligned with existing policy from multiple service sectors who support young people. The second criterion required that young people's experiences of transition were congruent with the study definition of complex support needs which included experience of two or more of the following: having resided in out-of-home care; living with intellectual or other cognitive disability; experiences of mental illness; homelessness or housing insecurity; specialist or alternative education; problematic drug and alcohol use; and/or police or youth justice contact.",

Participants were then invited to choose the transition they wished to body map, using a range of art and collage materials. During and after construction of the body maps, participants were invited to explain their choice of symbols and what they represented in the transition experience. These explanations enhanced credibility by allowing the researcher to check meanings and interpretations with the young person (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) .

This narrative approach was based on the ethnographic concept of constructing rich, thick description discussed by Geertz (1973) and included a depiction of the story presented by the body map; an account of the symbols, and their placement and intended meaning in the body map; and a key that explained the symbols.

Individual interviews generated verbatim transcripts, and body mapping resulted in both visual body maps and detailed narratives about the body maps and the field notes about the process used to construct them. Analytical approaches to body mapping are underdeveloped and emerging (Orchard, 2017) , and data analysis in this study reflects that developmental status. In this study, visual images of body maps were initially analysed using content analysis. A table of symbols used in the body maps was developed to identify patterns across the data. Each symbol was grouped into types related to their location on the map (i.e. whether inside or outside of the body); whether the symbol was text or image; and the overarching meaning of the symbol (for example, the depiction of support persons, or the expression of particular emotions). Content analysis enabled researchers to confirm that key aspects and symbols included in the visual images were considered, and facilitated analysis of the types, uses, meanings and locations of symbols as presented in various sections of the body maps. Narrative body mapping data, the results of the content analysis, and young people's interview transcripts were all analysed using grounded theory methods (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) as discussed in Charmaz (2014) . Initial line-by-line coding of narrative body mapping data, body map content analysis, and interview transcripts was undertaken. The line-by-line coding used the heuristic device of gerunds, allowing the researchers to gain a sense of action from young people's accounts, stay close to the data and begin understanding the content from young people's perspectives. This process was also complemented through the use of memo-writing, which assisted the researchers in determining their analytical direction (Charmaz, 2014) . Coding was subsequently organised into higher order categories based upon shared characteristics and themes using the constant comparison approach described in Braun and Clarke (2006) . Cross-coding of the interview transcripts by the first three authors of transcripts and body mapping narratives ensured consistency of themes and minimised individual researcher biases (Barbour, 2001) . The combination of textual and visual data enabled a rich understanding of young people's lived experiences, including their accounts of paid relationships.",

These relationships fundamentally involved being known, acting on urgent and practical issues, and supporting their sense of identity, agency, self-worth and connectedness. Unlike relationships where interactions with young people were purely transactional in nature, positively significant acts and relationships brought about successful outcomes for young people and, at best, established foundations for their futures. These outcomes included building skills for independent living; establishing secure housing; supporting their full engagement in education; strengthening their mental health; inspiring vocational choices; testing out new identities and new ways of relating in safe spaces; and finding kindred spirits with whom they could make sense of the chaos involved in transition. As described in other studies of relationship-based practice with young people (for example, Augsberger & Swenson, 2015; Ungar, Liebenberg, Landry, & Ikeda, 2012) , these relationships involved an emotional connection and offered a vehicle for healing. The findings are also consistent with a relational-cultural theory framework, which proposes that individual resilience can be strengthened through growth-fostering relationships (Hartling, 2009; Jordan, 2014) . The young people in this study showed examples of achieving functional and mutually-valued connections with adults, despite having past experiences of fragmented and dangerous relationships.",

Young people consistently highlighted how positive, singular, and sometimes simple and time-limited actions and connections with workers stimulated their own sense of agency and opened the doors to new and positive possibilities. Workers who engaged with young people in these ways did not resolve or seek to resolve every issue the young person brought with them to the service. Worker efficacy was instead based in authentic engagement and the targeting of issues that were of greatest salience to the young person. These findings suggest that much can be gained, even within brief encounters with young people, if workers are attuned to humanistic and flexible ways of relating. This can involve discerning the core concerns of young people which may not always be clearly defined in policy and procedure (Abel & Wahab, 2017) Many young people in this study discussed their experiences with individual workers interchangeably with their involvement with agencies and systems. To some extent, these accounts speak about the important part workers play in representing their agency or professional role. Individual positive connections with young people can foster trust and rapport with the service as a whole and provide another point of stability in young people's lives (Malvaso, Delfabbro, Hackett, & Mills, 2016) .",

Constant disruptions to paid relationships interfered with young people's wellbeing and experiences of transition. While some of the underlying causes of instability in young people's lives lay outside workers' purview (for example, family breakdowns and geographical relocations), young people themselves identified that systemic factors contributing to disruptions in paid relationships could be addressed through changes in service delivery. Participants suggested that effective relationships should 'follow' young people as they navigate various services, proposing access to a single coordinating organisation or worker which/who accesses and negotiates services, provides information, and advocates across systems for the young person until such support is no longer required.",

Some of these young people shared their feelings about and experiences with these workers during body mapping and were frequently very positive about the support they were receiving from this person. While it is likely that young people chose workers they trusted and valued to participate in the body mapping, and that positive comments offered about workers were reflective of the effectual nature of the relationship, it is also possible that some young people felt compelled to talk more positively about that worker than they might have done in the worker's absence. There were however examples of young people without workers present during data collection but who also shared positive stories about current and former workers. Conversely, some young people who had workers present during body mapping shared both positive and negative stories about workers in their testimonia. The body mapping process allowed young people substantial choice and control over what issues were discussed, and offered an opportunity for young people to express their views on paid relationships in ways they may have never experienced before. Its utility as a research method in eliciting young people's views may also have relevance in the context of professional practice, as a creative way of engaging with hard-to-reach young people.",

However, both approaches required a significant amount of time and commitment from young people about sensitive issues, and to do both would increase the risk of research participant burden for young people (Lingler, Schmidt, Gentry, Hu, & Terhorst, 2014) .
