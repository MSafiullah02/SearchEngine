Syria reported its first case on 22 March 2020 however 34 concerns were raised that this was delayed and that underreporting continues. 35 Main: Syria's conflict has displaced more than half its pre-war population leaving 6.7 million people 36 internally displaced; consequent overcrowding with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare 37 (including laboratory capacity) could lead to conditions which are ideal for spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 38 Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria's 39 borders, each with their own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation with little 40 interaction between them could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, 41 COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing exponentially, overwhelming 53 otherwise well-functioning health systems in Europe and North America.

Globally, only one third of countries have capacities to respond 56 to a health emergency in line with International Health Regulations; conflict affected countries are 57 disproportionately affected 1 due to the consequences of conflict on their health systems, 58 infrastructure, institutions, economy and public health leaving them ill-prepared to manage",

An estimated 22,000 Iranians visit Syria each year on 108 pilgrimage and there remain thousands of Iranian militia in Syria. 12 Despite the official declaration of 109 border closures with all neighbouring countries, there are concerns that some crossing points (which 110 are vital for humanitarian aid) 5 remain unmonitored and porous which could facilitate the spread changes which have resulted from the Syrian war and changes to military control have 114 led to the presence of at least three parallel health systems, each with different capacities, 115 preparedness strategies and governance: government-controlled areas make up the largest proportion 116 of the country and are supported by the Syrian MoH and WHO, northeast Syria (NES) which is under 117 de facto Kurdish control, and northwest Syria (NWS) which is under opposition control (under the 118 Syrian National Coalition). These multiple health systems have resulted in an incoherent, fragmented 119 response with different processes for the detection, control and management of cases in place. 12,13 120 121 A focus on north west Syria where recent escalation has displaced 1 million civilians 122 123 Since 1 December 2019, a further escalation of violence has displaced almost one million Syrian 124 civilians in NWS (where the estimated population is 4.17 million) towards the Syria-Turkish border; 125 81% of these are women and children. 5,6 This has left hundreds of thousands with inadequate food, 126 shelter or health and humanitarian care. All sectors are overwhelmed with the most acute needs being use) for the 4.17 million civilians in the area. 11 Even with conservative estimates of numbers of cases, 137 these would be insufficient for the potential needs and the inadequate health system capacity could 138 result in excess mortality should infection spread. 18 This could be amplified by the insufficient 139 numbers of healthcare workers in general and those with relevant skills (e.g. intensive care, 140 pulmonology, infectious diseases) who can meet the demand with potential for care for non-COVID-141 19 conditions suffering. There are estimated to be a total of 4046 healthcare workers in two parallel mechanisms for syndromic surveillance of communicable diseases in Syria. 149 EWARN (Early Warning and Response Network) was set up by the Assistance Coordination Unit 150 which forms part of the Syrian National Coalition; it predominantly works in non-government 151 controlled areas. EWARS (Early Warning and Response System) was established by the Syrian MoH 152 with support and funding from WHO and work predominantly in government-controlled areas. 20,21 153 These systems report a number of syndromes including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) 154 and ILI (influenza like illness) which could act as early indicators for COVID-19. EWARN has been 155 revised to ensure rapid alert verification, triaging and testing of suspected cases. Idlib governorate. In GCAs, WHO has supported the Central Public Health Laboratory 164 in Damascus and provided five PCR machines (with associated testing kits;) plans are to establish 165 satellite laboratories in Aleppo, Homs and Lattakia governorates. 22 In NES, samples are to be sent to 166 Damascus for testing where delays to reporting results could delay effective isolation and contact 167 tracing. See table 1. Across the three areas, there is little ability for prompt testing, populations at risk are the elderly, those with comorbidities, those who are 173 immunosuppressed and possibly those who are pregnant. Nearly 41% of the Syrian population 174 requires treatment for non-communicable diseases and smoking prevalence among Syrian men is 175 51.3%. 23 There are over 90,000 detainees in Syria 24 and most are held without charge or have been 176 charged with protesting against the Syrian government or providing healthcare to those opposed to the 177 Syrian government while others are held by armed forces or militias in NES and NWS 24 . Syrians in 178 prison are faced with over-crowded, poorly ventilated and unhygienic conditions where torture is 179 prevalent 24 , healthcare is sparse and malnutrition is rife which could lead to the rapid spread of SARS-180 CoV-2 in this population and a high proportion of severe or critical cases 25 . The detention centres 181 themselves could act as a reservoir of infection where staff or visitors entering the centres recommended measures which could slow transmission including isolation of cases, 187 self-quarantine, social distancing and the closures of public institutions (e.g. schools, universities) which restrict human rights 27 . As such, tailored approaches relevant to the 192 local context are important as some of the internationally introduced measures may be impracticable 193 in low income or conflict-affected countries such as Syria where various social, economic and 194 political factors have affected society and the health system. 28 Local humanitarian organisations have 195 led community hygiene education and disinfection campaigns to support the local , around 80% of the population live in poverty where food or supplies may be scarce 29 ; as 199 such, strict home quarantine measures which may leave breadwinners unable to work even for 200 relatively short periods could have severe consequences for the population. In areas outside of 201 government control, such as in NWS, 150,000 hectares of arable land have been unavailable for 202 farming after the arrival of displaced people; this could lead to further food insecurity and 203 starvation 11 . In addition, for those already living in desperation, the threat of COVID-19 could feel 204 distant when daily survival is challenging and they face many threats to their life. 205 206 Researchers estimate that there is capacity to manage a maximum of 6,500 patients across the whole 207 of Syria though capacity varies greatly across the country; this is based on the estimated number of 208 ventilators across Syria. 12 Measures to upscale and upskill have been slow but are being planned 209 across the three health systems. For example, in NWS, both community and health facility-based 210 isolation approaches are to be introduced. Plans are underway to increase the number of intensive care 211 unit beds 30 and training has started for 540 healthcare workers across 180 health facilities to ensure 212 they are up to date with infection prevention and control and patient safety and to commence training 213 to work in intensive care units. 11 However, these measures may still not meet potential demand. Other 214 initiatives which support upskilling and skill shifting are urgently required to ensure the healthcare 9 217 Although some measures have been taken to identify and meet gaps in the COVID-19 response, 218 shortages in human resources for health, personal protective equipment (PPE), and a lack of effective 219 infection prevention and control measures could adversely affect the remaining healthcare workers. 220 Further losses of healthcare workers as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adding to the more than 221 923 who have been killed during the conflict) could cause further attrition to the workforce. 32 222 Healthcare workers at the frontline of healthcare provision in Syria are particularly vulnerable not 223 only to the risk of transmission but also the ethical challenges posed by the volatile context, including 224 difficult triage and resource allocation decisions due to limited resources, weak governance structures 225 and the hostile environment where healthcare workers may be threatened. by protracted conflict face numerous challenges with health systems that have 231 already been decimated; as such, SARS-CoV-2 could spread rapidly through affected populations, 232 particularly among those in the most vulnerable groups. In Syria, the multiple fragmented and 233 increasingly politicised health systems within its borders present further challenges and the response 234 requires locally appropriate interventions. Internationally recommended measures are unlikely to be 235 enforceable or effective in areas where a lack of sanitation and overcrowding are rife; as such, rapid 236 expansion of WASH and addressing shelter, particularly for IDPs is needed. Ceasefires (as have 237 occurred in Yemen,) protection of health workers and health facilities, the expansion of humanitarian 238 access through the remaining border crossings and evacuation of critical cases for life saving 239 treatment are practicable measures which can support the response to COVID-19 in Syria.",
