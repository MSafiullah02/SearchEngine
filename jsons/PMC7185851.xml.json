Before entering clinical trials, prototype vaccines undergo toxicology testing that is conducted in a Good Laboratory Practice-compliant laboratory. Private firms then build on this knowledge to develop clinically feasible vaccine products and shepherd them through clinical testing. The vaccine's manufacturer then must submit a Biological License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for evaluation and approval before marketing. The approval process tests extensively for safety and efficacy, along with purity and absence of contaminants. If data raise serious concerns about product safety or efficacy during any phase, FDA may request additional information or studies or may halt ongoing clinical studies.30 The entire research, development, and approval process may require 10 years or more.31 Estimates of the cost of this process range from $110 million to $802 million ($US 2000).1\n,\n32\nTable 1\nsummarizes information on the different phases in vaccine research.",

Although vaccine manufacturing regulation originally was controlled by the U.S. Public Health Service under the Biologics Control Act of 1902, this authority now rests with FDA. The majority of vaccines approved by FDA are manufactured from live (attenuated) or killed (inactivated) organisms. Some are based on partially purified components of an organism such as diphtheria and tetanus, and a handful are recombinantly produced, such as the hepatitis B vaccine.4 Vaccines are manufactured by at least three methods: egg-based (e.g., influenza vaccine), cell-derived (e.g., polio vaccine), or recombinant (e.g., hepatitis B vaccine). For bacterial vaccines, the bacterial pathogens are grown in bioreactors using media developed for optimizing the yield of the antigen (e.g., Hib)31 (Figure 1\n).",

Thus, FDA production facility requirements are rigorous, and these stringent regulatory hurdles add to the production costs of vaccines. Because new vaccines generally are more complex than older products, vaccine suppliers face increasingly stringent regulation of manufacturing facilities even after a vaccine is approved. Suppliers undergo frequent inspections of their production facilities by each country in which the vaccine product is licensed and by FDA. Individual product batches require separate approval for release, and slight modifications to production processes or the packaging of products may trigger expensive and time-consuming product reviews.33 FDA also requires frequent upgrades of vaccine production facilities to reflect state-of-the-art manufacturing processes. Recently, FDA quality control inspections led to Merck's recall of 1.2 million doses of childhood vaccines to protect against meningitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis B because of contaminated manufacturing equipment.21\n,\n34 The recall involved 11 lots of the Hib vaccine Pedvaxhib and two lots of a combination vaccine for both Hib and hepatitis B sold under the brand name Comvax.34\n",

Although pharmaceuticals in the aggregate are a large market representing approximately $340 billion annually ($US 2000) worldwide, sales of vaccines are estimated at just $4.8 billion to $6 billion per year, with about one-quarter of total sales in the United States.36 This $6-billion market is controlled primarily by the five major manufacturers. Moreover, most vaccines are used at most several times in a lifetime, whereas therapeutic biologics and small-molecule drugs often are used every day. Thus, markets for small-molecule and biotechnology drugs treating chronic diseases are considerably more attractive to investors than vaccines.",

Approximately one-half of the study respondents reported financial reasons and low profit margins from immunizations as factors affecting their purchase and administration of vaccines. These authors concluded that physicians who provide vaccines to children and adolescents are dissatisfied with third-party reimbursement levels and the increasing financial strain on their practices from immunizations. Thus, increasing vaccine prices, a greater number of vaccine doses, and declining provider reimbursement for these products appear to be factors constraining both patient and provider demand for these products.",

The petition is reviewed to determine whether it meets the criteria for compensation. A vaccine injury table lists and explains injuries/conditions that are presumed to be caused by vaccines. It also lists time periods in which the first symptom of these injuries/conditions must occur after receiving the vaccine. To qualify for compensation, a petitioner must show that an injury found in the vaccine injury table occurred or must prove that the vaccine caused the condition. A case found eligible for compensation is scheduled for a hearing to assess the amount of compensation. Most noncompensable claims receive awards for attorney fees and costs. Congressional approval of this act also set in motion the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for monitoring vaccine adverse events.",

However, the struggle against infectious disease is a continual process requiring new vaccines for the challenges that may confront human health in the future. The vaccine market is fragile and requires both supply- and demand-side interventions. Vaccine availability has been limited by the number of suppliers, high R&D and production costs, and safety problems leading to increased regulatory requirements. Demand has been constrained by rapidly increasing vaccine costs, financing issues that have constrained efforts to achieve targets set for population immunization rates, and parental attitudes regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccine products. To date, the U.S. government, in concert with private philanthropies, has implemented a patchwork of policies to make the vaccine market more attractive for private firms and to increase access to these products for individuals. We would argue that what is needed is an integrated policy approach that preserves incentives for market entry and innovation in the vaccine industry while simultaneously addressing parental vaccine concerns and increasing immunization funding and reimbursement for both providers and patients.\n",
