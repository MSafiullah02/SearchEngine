In line with EFSA\"s policy on openness and transparency, and in order for EFSA to receive comments from the scientific community and stakeholders on its work, EFSA engages in public consultations on key issues. Accordingly, the draft guidance document, which should be read in conjunction with the general guidance document on the evaluation of Article 13.1, 13.5 and 14 health claims 7 , was published on the EFSA website for comments (28 September 2010 to 22 October 2010 , and formed the basis for discussion, together with the comments received during the public consultation, at a technical meeting with scientific experts in the field on 2 December 2010 in Amsterdam. The NDA Panel prepared an updated version of the guidance document, taking into account the questions/comments received. The updated guidance document was discussed and adopted at the NDA Plenary meeting of 26-28 January 2011, and is published in the EFSA Journal 8 . EFSA is committed to publishing the comments received during the public consultation, as well as a short report on the outcome of the consultation, also taking into account the comments received at the technical meeting of 2 December 2010.",

A summary of the comments received is given below, and all written comments received are listed in the Appendix. Comments related to policy or risk management aspects were considered to be outside the scope of the consultation, and are not covered in this report. Some comments were considered to be too detailed and technical to be covered in a guidance document, for example comments on experimental design and methods, statistical analysis or exhaustive lists of appropriate outcome measures for claimed effects. Some of the comments may need to be considered in the context of a specific application for health claims, and are difficult to be covered in a guidance document. It should be noted that the guidance document represents the views of the NDA Panel based on the experience gained to date with the evaluation of health claims in these areas. Health claims are often technically complex and unique, and it is not possible for the NDA Panel to predict all potential claims, including appropriate outcome measures. Some of the comments have been taken up in the general guidance for stakeholders on the evaluation of Article 13.1, 13.5 and 14 health claims.",

If the outcome measure was the reduction of specific pathogens, the relevance of such a reduction should be justified, for example, by the magnitude of reduction or by evidence for a reduction in clinical outcomes related to infections accompanying the reduction in pathogens/toxins. It was also made clear that an observed increase in the number of any group of microorganisms needs to be accompanied by evidence for a beneficial physiological or clinical outcome, and that these criteria apply to both adult and infant/children populations. It is also emphasised in the document that other outcome measures such as reduction of intestinal permeability or pH are not beneficial physiological effects per se, but may provide evidence on the mechanisms and biological plausibility of a claim related to defence against pathogens. The list of groups of microorganisms which are considered to be pathogenic was slightly amended. A possible beneficial physiological effect related to the restoration of a disturbed microbiota needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the evidence provided.

It leads to malabsorption of proteins and other nutrients. Hypochlorhydria may also lead to bacteria overgrowth in the intestine. Supporting a healthy pH should be regarded as a beneficial physiological function. References: Christiansen PM. The incidence of achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria in healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Scand J Gastroenterol. 1968; 3(5) : 497-508. Kassarjian Z, Russell RM.

Bile quality and release Bile quality and its timely release into the duodenum is essential for healthy function of the GI tract and proper absorption of fats and other nutrients. Fatty acids in the lumen of the duodenum stimulate endocrine cells to release the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK stimulates contractions in the smooth muscle of the gallbladder. As well, CCK causes relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, allowing bile release into the duodenum. Acidic chyme in the lumen of the duodenum stimulates other endocrine cells to release the hormone secretin. Secretin stimulates duct cells in the liver to release bicarbonate into the bile. Accordingly CCK and secretin should be recognised as useful biomarkers for healthy bile function. References: Maton PN, Selden AC, Chadwick VS. Large and small forms of cholecystokinin in human plasma: measurement I do not agree with this statement. As it was argued in the PASSCLAIM publication on gut health and immunity (Cummings et al., 2004) , changes in immune parameters may not necessarily translate into improved host defence. The authors state \"It is not clear whether the wide variation in in vivo and ex vivo functional responses among apparently healthy individuals results in variable susceptibility to infection\u2026.Ultimately, a change in susceptibility to, or severity of, infectious disease is the outcome of greatest significance\" Changes in immune parameters may not be relevant because there may be excess capacity in some immune functional responses and a further increase would not lead to improved immune function (Cummings et al., 2004) . On the other hand, there may be an improved immune function without measurable changes in the immune param-eters, since these parameters a subject to large individual variations due to a number of factors, such as nutrient status, age, hormonal status, stress, exercise, alcohol con-sumption, smoking, just to name a few (Cummings et al., 2004) . Therefore, changes in immune parameters may be masked by individual variations, and not be detectable in a human clinical trial, although a reduction of number and duration of infections is observed. Would EFSA in this case reject a claim on immune function? How would EFSA explain a reduction in number and severity of infections if not by an improved immune re-sponse? Does it make sense to demand a battery of measurements, if the relevance for the intended claim is questioned even by experts (see Cummings et al., 2004) 1.1. EFSA should follow same principles in claims according to article 13.1 as well as 13.5 and 14. At present equality of criteria for evidence is not applied as can be seen from the decision on vitamin D and immune function: For a claim \"contributes to normal function of the immune system\" EFSA sees sufficient evidence based on 3 review articles. In these articles the authors refer to animal trials and epidemiological date mainly. There is evidently no data based on pivotal human trials in the target population of healthy subjects in Europe.The authors of the reviews see \"promising\" data, but not final evidence on immune function of vitamin D and still unclear mechanisms and even paradoxical results. Therefore a cause-effect relationship is still to be shown.The purpose of the Health Claim Regulation (see preamble) is protection of the consumer and promotion of innovations by the industry. Favouring non-innovative generic claims and impeding innovations is in contrast of the purpose of the regulation.1.2. The opinion statement by EFSA should be more refined and transition time lines extended based on such refined statements: The present situation shows that a more refined process of decision making is mandatory to prevent major economic damage to European companies and to prevent the false impression of the consumer that there is no evidence at all for major categories of functional foods. In case of a 90% probability for efficacy (p<0.10) a pending procedure might be more adequate and less harmful for the companies than a no decision. In such a case a transition time line of use of claims might be a solution. In this transition time of 3-5 years the evidence may be provided by appropriate confirmative trials which would be reassessed by EFSA.1.3. Risk Reduction Claims should be enabled based on Relative Risk (in case of lacking risk factor)Claims on Risk Reduction should be permitted based on Relative Risk (RR), since the wording risk reduction is sufficiently cautious to prevent consumers from too far fetching promises.Question 1:Can a body function claim \"enhances immune defence\" or \"strengthens immune defence\" be based on antibody response to a pathogen in a vaccination trial aloneoronly in conjunction with supporting evidence by outcomes of infections related to such pathogens?Question 2:Can a body function claim \"enhances immune defence\" or \"strengthens immune defence\" be based on NK cell counts or NK cell activity or NK activity index (NK cell count multiplied with activity) according to H. Bruunsgaard, Exp. Gerontol. 37(2001) 127-136) -during infection,-only in the healthy state,-within incubation timewhen assessed in conjuction with later infection outcome?Can this evidence be provided by different studies, where one/some are dedicated to NK cell function and others to infection outcome?Question 3:Is the following sufficient, to show cause-effect relationship:Efficacy of a probiotic strain shown for enhancement of antibody response to an influenza vaccine; Or is further mechanistic evidence required, although the EMEA is accepting antibody response as sufficient measure to assess protection against the pathogen against which the antibodies are directed (e.g. in case of influenza vaccination)?If so, is evidence for a shift of the Th1/Th2 ratio to Th1 response in human PBMC by the the same product/probiotic strain in vitro sufficient, based on the fact that it is known that enhancement of Th1 response results in an increase in IgG production by B cells ( (Finegold et al. 1983 ). In conjunction with the shifts observed in the genus Bacteroides, the decline in beneficial Bifidobacteria numbers is one of the most marked changes in the elderly gut, with a number of studies confirming these reductions (Mitsuoka et al. 1974; Benno et al. 1992; Mitsuoka 1992; Gavini et al. 2001; Hopkins et al. 2001; Woodmansey et al. 2004) . Taken in conjunction with reduced species diversity, such changes indicate a decline in the stability of this population in the ageing colonic ecosystem. A wide range of bifidobacterial species are found in infants and young adults, however, in the elderly population, species diversity is reduced to one or two dominant organisms, in particular Bifidobacterium adolescentis or the phenotypically similar Bifidobacterium angulatum and Bifidobacterium longum (Mitsuoka et al. 1974; Gavini et al. 2001; He et al. 2001; Hopkins and Macfarlane 2002) . One suggestion used to explain the decline in bifidobacterial species diversity in elderly people is reduced adhesion to the intestinal mucosa, although it is not clear if this is because of changes in the bacteria, or in the chemical composition and structure of colonic mucus (Ouwehand et al. 1999; He et al. 2001) . Such a decline could result in a reduced functionality and immune responsiveness in the gut, and an increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections. Changes at species level of such a nutritionally important sub-population could have considerable consequences for the elderly host, because of alterations in metabolic activities, and for other bacteria in the ecosystem that rely on a complex cross-feeding network within the gut. Dietary probiotics delivery is one of the possible strategies to counteract these changes, to bring more species diversity and increase the number of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria in ageing people. General comments EFSA needs to clarify the benchmarks for claim substantiation. Section 2.2 is clearly written in a way that suggests data are undergoing peer-review for quality by the panel, While this may be the case for commercially sensitive data ( although experts outwith the panel will be needed), for published works which have already undergone peer-review, it is not acceptable for members of the panel to weigh the evidence and decide on its quality and importance. This seems to be an attempt to mimic regulatory bodies for medicines, but these are foods. If one begins with the proper null hypothesis that a food should have no effect, then demonstration of a statistically significal effect should be sufficient for the claim to be allowed.",

            "text": "Barts and the London School of Medicine 4. Immune system The section on the immune system is generally not helpful and seems to have been constructed without reference to article 13.5 and 14. In the first paragraph of 4.1, lines 260-262, the confusion is compounded by mixing up immunity as a protective against against infections, with inappropriate immunity as manifest by allergies. Sections 4.2 then talks about inflammation in a broad and unhelpful sense and 4.3 goes on about risk reductions for infections and allergy. these are completely different things and combining them only confuses the issue. Lines 308-311 are a good example of confusion. Is EFSA really saying that a human intervention study which shows that a food had a beneficial effect is only supportive evidence, but that a change in a risk factor is needed? It is worth remembering that the Finnish studies which claimed that probiotics given to mother and then her baby could prevent the development of eczema showed no reduction in markers of allergy in the children. Line 285 and 286 suggest that boosting of antibody titers could be used to substantiate a health benefit claim against pathogens. The question which immediately arises from this statement is whether the claim can be used to substantiate an effect against all pathogens, a class of pathogens, or the pathogen against which the vaccine was designed to protect. Common sense says that the last case should be adopted.Lines 268 to 273 have an important omission. Undue focus has been made on reductions in incidence of infections and pathogen numbers. A consistent finding in many probiotic studies is that taking the product shortens the duration of sysmptoms. The immune system is there to allow recovery from infection and quicker recovery is a meaningful clinical endpoint and indicative of an effect on the immune system. Whether this correlates with a biomarker of resistance is an unacceptably high hurdle to cross since it is extremely well established that protective immunity is multi-factorial and cellular immunity is very hard to measure. It is also shows a rather narrow understanding of the immune response. \u2022 which studies/outcome measures are appropriate for the substantiation of function claims and disease risk reduction claims? in order to clarify the requirements for substantiation of health claims. These clarifications should also be seen as an opportunity to reduce the number of borderline cases. Indeed, clear criteria for the substantiation of health claims clearly differentiating them from therapeutic indications, could be a major help for the competent authorities in evaluation borderline cases. Consequently the BELGIAN FEDERAL AGENCY FOR MEDICINES AND HEALTH PRODUCTS was surprised to see to rationale followed by the NDA. This rationale, although aiming at clarifying the requirements for health claim substantiation, seems on certain levels quite confusing because it would seem not to take into account restrictions emerging from legislation concerning other fields than food (supplements) and health claims. From legislation on clinical trial for example, it is clear that when a clinical trial (as defined in the Directive 2001/20/EC) is conducted, the product used therein is clearly an investigational medicinal product. As food supplements are supposed to have a nutritional or physiological effect, these effects would normally not be deductable from a clinical trial. Moreover food supplements aim at supplementing a normal diet, which is difficultly associable to the notion of a clinical trial. Another factor to be taken into account is that in a lot of these trails the investigated endpoint is clearly therapeutical, a fact which also contributes to the product\"s status being medicinal.

This includes apparently also the views on whether an effect is a beneficial physiological effect. It should be noted that these views are not uniformly shared among scientists worldwide. This is in particular the case for body function claims (e. g. in the USA only disease risk reduction claims are evaluated following similar criteria). We would like to point out that it is not the (nutritional) science that has changed for these body functions, but it is the criteria that have changed into pharmacological and study-by-study stand-alone assessments. This needs to be clarified to the outside as otherwise, it falsely implies that it was industry who may have misled the consumer. Specifically, gastrointestinal function claims that are not directly disease-related or classical stool-related bowel functions are consolidated by science as well and supported by academic scientists worldwide, e. g. microbiotaassociated functions. Moreover, there are earlier publications by scientific expert panels, e. g. the EU-funded PASSCLAIM project on gut and immunity (Cummings et al., 2004, Eur. J. Nutr. (Supp2) This differs in the current guidance document when the NDA is explicitly asked which claimed effects are beneficial physiological effects in general. If effects are dismissed out of the context of specific applications as non beneficialas in this draft Guidance -the impact of such judgement is much more substantial and requires a scientific credence that is not provided in this document (lacks scientific references). A view of the NDA on \"beneficial physiological effects\" without valid scientific argumentation cannot be presented to the outside as absolute and must not appear as generally accepted scientific evidence L101:Assessing beneficial physiol. effects There are several recent panel publications that have also been subject to peer review by experts in the field and have expressed different views on the relevance of certain effects than the NDA. One example is the prebiotic effect that is supported by a large scientific community which is simply not mentioned. Other examples are the views on fermentation, immunological and inflammatory markers as supportive evidence, only. For e.g. cholesterol, it took decades of intense scientific discussions to reach today''s level of acceptance as marker. However, even for cholesterol there is no common agreement whether it is total, LDL-, HDL-chol or their ratio what is more meaningful and all only give an indication for the probability to get a CV complication rather than to be predictive. Many subjects live well with high levels without CVD. Nevertheless, for risk/benefit balance, cholesterol is accepted as appropriate. We do not question this, but want to point out that it took more than one document to come to this stage: Products were on the market long before a consensus on cholesterol was achieved. The cholesterol example also shows that consensus on such markers cannot be based on intervention studies alone. It requires an integrated approach including associations and observations from impaired and healthy status. Claims with smaller health implications that clearly demonstrate a physiological effect, but lack proof in a clinical sense (e.g. normal gut flora vs. pathogens) require a different approach to assess \"beneficial\". These are claims targeted for markers of possible physiological effects, but not aimed at a disease, i.e. authentic \"health-related\" messages. In these regards, the document lacks true guidance and compiles previous views, only. Solutions and explanations in an accepted scientific manner are needed. In order to allow progress in a way that consumers can benefit from advances in developing areas of nutrition -taking account of the nature of nutritional science as a holistic science in contrast to pharmocology as a targeted science -a broad scientific consultation among experts should be opened whether effects are beneficial. This should address EFSAs gaps and respect other scientific consensus, references and peer views. Such an appoach should find credible consensus for beneficial physiological effects based on expert knowledge and reflecting today''s possible standard L100:Assessment of benefit The current document confirms a beneficial effect for bowel regularity, explicitly transit time and stool bulk, and EFSA has in a different context also acknowledged the beneficial effects of lower total and lower LDL cholesterol. In order to be consistent through European Regulations as well as scientific opinions, the same should apply to all effects that in other contexts are beneficial, i. e. reduction of postprandial glucose and insulin (not a subject of the guidance document under discussion) as well as the fermentability by the colonic flora. Otherwise, it would be confusing and misleading to the consumer that an effect that is considered as beneficial and officially acknowledged in one, but not another context by the same panel.",

We have, however, comments regarding the request for \"validated\" subjective global symptom severity questionnaires in a stringent way:-So-called validated questionnaires are either designed to distinguish between diseases and sites of the intestine tract. These cannot be used for global symptoms, but may contain some useful elements.-The other questionnaires that claim to be validated are usually disease-specific and may not completely fit a particular study population. Even if IBS subjects are chosen for assessing an effect, often, sub-sets are the appropriate panel (e. g. with/without diarrhea; suffering in particular from bloating or abdominal pain etc.). In this case, a selection of relevant questions from well-established questionnaires would be more scientifically appropriate. In some cases, language adaptations are necessary in order to allow the assessment in panels in countries in which the typical scientific phrases are not common as well as their translation back into English. As another complicating factor, strict validation requires \"responsiveness\", i. e. means that a positive and negative control are available whichgiven the nature of functional bowel disorders as without defined clinical measurable symptoms, resembles a chicken/egg principle.For these reasons -there are certainly more -\"validated\" should to be attenuated/ameliorated into \"scientifically appropriate questionnaires for the study panel and the disorder under investigation\".As up to now, gastrointestinal disorders have been appreciated as beneficial physiological effect but without a positive causal-effect relationship -one reason being the use of a non-validated questionnaire. It can be speculated that the available \"validated\" questionnaires are inappropriate for studying the health effects of nutrients on gastrointestinal disorders. The EFSA should be more open in these regards to allow other scientific approaches as well.",

It is certainly equally important that the healthy flora contributes to a gut content that carries a lower toxic burden to the host and may even be important for contributing to energy metabolism of the colonic epithelium. A focus on pathogens would only consider one (pathogenic or medical) aspect. A focus on pathogens would aim at disease risk reduction, whereas the use of beneficial markers would allow intended enhanced structure function claims. L200: A reduction of 1 log shall not be meaningful: In the context of foodborne pathogens, this opinion is puzzling as microbiologists are reluctant to define minimum effective doses for infectious microbes above 1. We query whether it would be ethical/possible to demonstrate an effectiveness that would be close to absence: The current proposal implies that a food ingredient needs to be as effective as a designed therapeutic antibiotic. Overall, limiting beneficial functions of the gut microflora to pathogen reduction and thereby deny the importance of \"just\" harmful, innocuous and in particular beneficial microbes is not shared by a large community of scientific experts in the field and writes off at least two decades of peer reviewed published gut microbial research.

L232ff: Supportive evidence EFSA views lower intestinal permeability, short chain fatty acid formation and pH as supportive evidence, only. The importance of an intact physical and functional barrier was emphasised for example by Cummings etal. (2004) . There is also a common understanding among scientists that short chain fatty acids are important nutrients for the gut epithelium and systemic health. We also question why a lower intestinal permeability is not considered as exclusively beneficial? This implies that normal gut leakage has a physiological function instead of being considered as a weak point in the body''s barrier (reference?) The document considers that maintenance of a normal immune function is a physiological effect and incidences of infections or allergic manifestations together with concomitant changes in immunological parameters, are in principle appropriate. This appears to be plausible. Markers of the immune system alone may be considered as supportive. However, we also noted that several vitamins and minerals were positively viewed for effects on the immune system. An example is folate (ID 91). The only reference provided in the respective opinion relate to in vitro effects on T lymphocytes, i.e. markers that can only be considered as supportive. Another reference for the basis for the conclusion , that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of folate and a normal function of the immune system (EFSA Journal 2009; 7(9): 1213 has not been provided.

Furthermore, I was under the impression that relatively small numbers of pathogens could be retained in the gut without ill effect and have assumed that this is related to the overall balance of the colonic flora among other things. I accept that it is not possible to define the exact numbers of the different bacterial groups that constitute a normal microbiota, which would in any case presumably vary considerably between individuals and with age for example, but for decades now, well respected experts in the field such as Roberfroid and Gibson have published, in peer reviewed journals, characteristics of a healthy gut flora derived from their own research and the research of others, which I recall include aspects such as SCFA production, low ammonia production, and characteristic energy metabolism among a number of others.

            "text": "b) Suggestion to consider subjects with functional constipation as appropriate study group. Functional constipation has been defined according to the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria on the basis of occurrence of straining, lumpy or hard stools, number of defecations per week, etc. Segmental contraction and propulsive activities are affected by endocrine, metabolic and environmental factors. Frequency of defecation is high in infancy and becomes less frequent during ageing. Environmental influences affecting colonic motility are stress, eating patterns/dietary intakes and physical activity. Due to the many influential factors, high inter-and intra-individual variation exists in the levels of colonic motility (Wyman et al. 1978 Gut 19: 146-150) . Episodes of low motility and in some cases of (temporary) incontinence can occur also in healthy people. Functional constipated subjects could be considered as appropriate study group to support claims on bowel function intended for the general population. ).This would imply that the same (level of) evidence is necessary for function claims and disease risk reduction claims. This is not clear.Therefore we would emphasize the importance of differentiating between the evidence needed for function claims and disease risk reduction claims for the gastrointestinal microbiota. In this respect, increasing the levels of health promoting bacteria could be considered a beneficial physiological effect to substantiate a function claim related to the improvement of normal defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.d) Line 211: The \"non-exhausive list of groups of microorganisms that are considered pathogenic or toxicogenic\". Food-borne pathogens do normally do not reside in the gastrointestinal tract of the general healthy population.\u00b7 Would pre-screening for individuals who are carriers for these organisms still be considered as representative for the general population ?\u00b7 Would the NDA consider it acceptable to test in different regional populations where food borne illness is more prevalent despite differences in the background diet of such regions when compared to Western diets ?e) Line 232: For claims \"to maintaining normal defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract\", effects on \"intestinal permeability can be assessed in human studies, such outcomes are themselves insufficient for the substantiation of the claim.In order for a pathogen to invade and translocate to extraintestinal tissues, it has to pass the epithelial barrier. The intestinal lining epithelial cells serve as a barrier that prevents invasion and translocation of microorganisms and is modulated by specific tight junctions present between epithelial cells and regulate paracellular permeability. The integrity of the intestinal barrier is essential for human health and impacted by stress, chronic inflammation and the use of drugs like antibiotics.In this respect, strengthening the epithelial barrier function could be considered a beneficial physiological effect to substantiate a functional claim related to the improvement of normal defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. The Cr-EDTA test as an example is considered a valid marker to assess intestinal barrier function. NOTE: the our knowledge the Draft In brief, the evidence available today is not considered convincing to the NDA panel that \"increasing the number of specific microorganisms or any group of microorganisms is in itself a beneficial physiological effect\", whereas \"reducing the numbers of specific pathogenic microorganisms is\". According to our interpretation however, a reduction in the levels of pathogens/toxins would not contribute to the maintenance or improvement of a function, but rather as earlier stated, serve as a risk factor to indicate to reduce the risk for developing disease (and hence referring to a disease risk reduction claim). We would therefore suggest considering an increase in the levels of health promoting bacteria a beneficial physiological effect to substantiate a function claim on the gastrointestinal microbiota (e.g. maintenance of normal defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract). Increasing the levels (/activities) of health promoting bacteria (> 1 log cfu/g and sustained over time), mainly of the genus Bifidobacterium, have been shown to exert beneficial physiological effects in the human body. This is demonstrated by the considerable body of evidence on the differences in the composition of the microbiota (high levels of bifidobacteria) between formula fed and breast fed infants (the latter being considered as having a \"healthy\" microbiota). Amongst the many functions bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have, is the creation of a non-permissive environment for pathogenic bacteria in the large bowel. This can be induced by metabolic shifts (production of antimicrobial substances, nutrient depletion) and/or occupying ecological niches of virulent micro-organisms restricting their abundance in the colonic microbiota (Servin, 2004 FEMS Microbiology Rev. 28: 405-440) .",

In addition to this we assume that EFSA may be interested in studies on individual strains, however since the strains may influence the properties of each other the studies on individual strains are of less importance. Concerning claims on gut microbiota and immune function we have a general remark i.e. we think that true endpoints looking at reduction in incidence, duration and severity of infections needs to be evaluated as very important factors for health claims. In the sections describing this area, possible markers are given a very high impact. We want to point out the many markers in this area are still not very clearly defined and established. By giving the markers a to strong impact on the possibility to get claims and giving the true endpoints only a secondary importance we are worried that this will considerable influence the possibility to get claims despite the fact that good intervention studies have been done.Concerning the gut microbiota the panel considers reduction of the number of pathogenic microorganisms a beneficial physiological effect. We agree that this can be the case, however it is common that healthy persons are carrying pathogenic or potential pathogenic microorganisms without any symptoms. It is thus questioned by us and in the scientific society whether the reduction of pathogenic organisms is a good marker for risk reduction. We question the line 203-208 stating that the reduction in incidence or duration of infections is not an evidence of risk reduction but that the reduction of pathogenic organisms is. We are in strong favour that the true endpoints showing the reduction in incidence and duration should be evaluated as very strong evidence for the influence of probiotics on infection. We therefore also think it is reasonable to give a possibility for claims on reduction of risk for infection based only on true endpoints and not always with a requirement on immune markers or numbers of pathogenic organisms.

The Panel seems thus to consider these markers insufficient to substantiate a claim on immune function by themselves.

Danone seeks information from the Panel for which specific cases, incidence of infection does not represent an effect on the immune system. Also, what is meant precisely by \u00ab appropriate \u00bb evidence? In addition, very often one study is dedicated to one primary objective in order to substantiate a certain effect. Accordingly in the present case, one study may be dedicated to a body function (immune function) and another to a clinical outcome (incidence of infection). This raises the following questions: -Would the Panel accept evidence on body function and clinical outcome in case it is provided by two separate studies? If not, either the clinical outcome or the body function will have to be defined as multiple primary/secondary parameters in one study which would increase the sample size required.",

However, does the immune function need to be the primary parameter or is it accepted as secondary parameter to substantiate a body function claim? The infectious disease endpoint would usually be defined as the primary parameter since it statistically requires a higher sample size than a body function. The Panel indicated that stimulation of protective antibody titres could be used to substantiate a health claim on the function of the immune system related to defence against pathogens (line 279-286). This raises the following questions: -Do enhanced antibody titres to antigens of a specific pathogen contained in vaccine substantiate a claim on the function of the immune system related to the defence against natural infection by this pathogen outside the vaccination context? -To which vaccines do the validated cut off values of vaccination mentioned refer to? -Can the following two phrases: \"increased numbers of individuals attaining protective levels\" or \"increments in titres in groups of individuals\" be used independently and therefore is each one alone sufficient to sustain a claim on the function? EFSA required that claims on \"natural defences\" be clearly defined regarding the specific aspect of immune function that is the subject of the claim (ln 266-267). Our question is: how specific must the claim on immune function be? For instance, in case of antibody response to specific vaccine, would it be claimed an enhancement of: immune defence, adaptive immunity or defence against pathogens?",

We however regret that no opportunity is given to discuss the general principles in the same level of detail (general principles as laid down in the draft briefing document for stakeholders on the evaluation of Article 13.1, 13.5 and 14 health claims). General principles may need to be adapted depending on the comments received during this public consultation. General comment 2: EHPM is of the opinion that this useful opportunity, to discuss fundamental aspects of a specific health topic, comes very late in the claims assessment process.

If this is not considered by EFSA, it may lead to valuable health benefits not being accepted because of principle. The aim of reducing a risk factor is ultimately to reduce the disease risk. If evidence is presented, showing that the food intervention reduces the risk of the disease, it would be scientifically sound to accept this effect, even in cases where the biological mechanisms (and therefore the risk factor) is not known (as is often the case in the current state of scientific knowledge). Furthermore, there are situations where the risk factor in itself is the substance of the claimed effect (e.g. nutritional risk factors (low intake of a certain nutrient)). In such cases the requirement to show a reduction of the risk factor does not make sense. Clarity is therefore needed as how evidence relating to the reduction of a disease risk without the identification of a risk factor can be used to obtain a positive opinion. If the interpretation of the Regulation would not allow this, it is nevertheless legitimate for EFSA to highlight this aberration to the law maker.",

Especially when it very unclear what should be understood by a normal immune function (Ln 263) and how this can be measured. Fugeia 3. Gastro-intestinal tract The draft guidance document states that the demonstration of production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) is insufficient for the substantiation of a health claim (p. 7 l. 232). This appears in conflict with the accumulating evidence that in the context of a Western diet, the increased production of SCFAs, and in particular of butyrate, in the lumen of the ceco-colon by bacterial fermentation of non-or poorly digestible carbohydrates is associated with improved colonic and systemic health. In view of the essential role of luminal butyrate for the normal functioning of the colon (reviewed by (1)) it is our position that increasing fecal levels of butyrate is in itself a desired beneficial effect of a nutritional intervention supporting the substantiation of a health claim towards maintaining normal healthy functioning of the gut. This position is based on following elements (discussed below): -the presence of butyrate throughout the colon is essential for a normal healthy functioning of the colon -the lowest butyrate levels are found in the distal colon and this part of the colon is thus most at risk for suboptimal butyrate levels -the concentration of butyrate in the feces reflect the butyrate concentration in the distal colon Independent of butyrate\"s well documented anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, its role as a primary source of energy for the colonocytes (providing over 70% of the energy of the colonocytes) allows concluding that the presence of sufficient levels of luminal butyrate throughout the entire colon is essential for a normal healthy functioning of the colon. This is confirmed by the fact that several colon diseases, such as colon cancer and ulcerative colitis (UC), have been associated with either or both low butyrate levels or impaired butyrate oxidation by the colonocytes. Furthermore, recent clinical studies in healthy populations showed that rectal butyrate administration at concentrations within the normal physiological range beneficially affects parameters directly linked to gastrointestinal wellbeing and resilience of the distal colon mucosa (2; 3). SCFAs production, including that of butyrate, is highest in the proximal colon. On transit the substrate is gradually More advice is needed on what are the acceptable study groupsfor example will data in constipated subjects be viewed as pertinent data to substantiate a claim? It would be helpful to give guidance on how many of the appropriate outcome measures EFSA would like to see data fori.e. is it acceptable to have good data on just one of these measures, or is EFSA looking for data on all of these measures, or something in between. More information would be helpful about how EFSA views subjective data in this areacan this be used to substantiate a claim, or would this only be considered as supporting data? Are subject-reported data on stool frequency considered as objective or subjective evidence, and is this a sufficiently strong end point to substantiate the claim?",

Can the Panel give any insight, or an example of an effect being beneficial in one \"context\" but not in another one? Or, if these sections are not meant to be interpreted as above, can the Panel then clarify these parts? Ln 107: \"Maintenance of a function\".

Ln 108-10: We assume that the last part of this sentence in brackets means to express that to make a disease risk reduction claim one cannot just demonstrate disease risk reduction; one must (additionally or possibly solely) demonstrate disease risk factor reduction. Ln 114-116: Please clarify whether both conditions should be met (114-115 and 116), or whether meeting one condition is sufficient. Ln 120: Could the Panel possibly clarify what is meant by these \"specific subgroups\" and how they are defined?

Ln 147-50: Does consistency necessarily have to be demonstrated across several studies, or can it also be shown in one large study, comprising a variety of subjects in a variety of settings such as one may have across several smaller studies? Furthermore, would the Panel agree that a meta-analysis of the pertinent studies or, even better, an analysis of the pooled data of such studies, is more pertinent than the individual studies? Ln 153-6: Could the Panel give any insight in how they evaluate whether such extrapolation is biologically justifiable?

Effects on transit time, on frequency of bowel movements and on stool bulk are related and will often coincide. If one demonstrates one of these effects only, can one such effect be considered to be sufficiently substantiated?

            "text": "If so, what would be the smallest relevant effect? If not known, how can we progress in this respect? Does EFSA consider a change from normal to normal (i.e. within the normal range) beneficial ? From the following we conclude that EFSA may see subtle changes in maintenance or improvement within the normal range as beneficial: In the context of article 13.1 claims on plant constituents, EFSA has evaluated the following effects as beneficial for human health: 1) maintenance of normal bowel function, 2) bowel motor function within normal range, 3) improvement of bowel motor function, 4) improvement of bowel motor function within the normal range, and 5) improvement of intestinal transit. Ln 167-8: Appropriate measures of bowel function include stool consistency, as it is the parameter of constipation that correlates best with transit time. Constipation is defined by the American National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases as having fewer than three bowel movements per week; possibly to be adapted to the European situation. We recommend that the Panel adopts a definition of constipation, and measures that validly reflect this. Consistency of the stools is related to the water content, which is around 70-80%. Constipated subjects generally pass harder stools with water content of less than 70%. In general, as daily stool weight increases, stools become softer and less well formed. Particularly, it is the hardness and dryness of stools that is thought to cause discomfort on defecation (Cummings et al. 2004 Eur. J. Nutr. (S2)43: II/118). Consistency of the stools (e.g. increased softness) could be considered as an outcome measure. Consistency is usually recorded in a diary after visual inspection (Bristol Stool Form Scale) or measured by physical analysis of water content. We would like to suggest to consider subjects with functional constipation as appropriate study group. Functional constipation has been defined according to the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria on the basis of occurrence of straining, lumpy or hard stools, number of defecations per week, etc. Segmental contraction and propulsive activities are affected by endocrine, metabolic and environmental factors. Frequency of defecation is high in infancy and becomes less frequent during ageing. Environmental influences affecting colonic motility are stress, eating patterns/dietary intakes and physical activity. Due to the many influential factors, high inter-and intra-individual variation exists in the levels of colonic motility (Wyman et al. 1978 Gut 19: 146) . Episodes of low motility and in some cases of (temporary) incontinence can occur also in healthy people. Functional constipated subjects could be considered as appropriate study group to support claims on bowel function intended for the general population. LGG (EFSA-Q-2008-444) the relevance of a (statistically significant) increase of score of bowel symptoms domain by 0.25 points on a 0-7 scale. Can \"rules of the thumb\" be developed on, in order to be meaningful for health, how many % one must minimally change on the total span of a scale? We believe urgency, feeling of incomplete evacuation, straining, belching, heartburn, nausea, post-meal fullness, vomiting and mucus or blood in stools also reflect gut (dis)comfort and therefore effects on any of these phenomena are relevant for health; would the Panel agree? Ln 179-81: Does the Panel say that if the differences between people with or without a certain condition are gradual rather than \"systematic\", data from people with such condition can be extrapolated to people without such condition? Ln 181-2: People with other functional gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia, functional constipation, functional diarrhea should also be considered as appropriate study groups to support claims on the general population, having milder versions of the same symptoms.",

Amongst the many functions bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have, is the creation of a non-permissive environment for pathogenic bacteria in the large bowel.

Ln 203-5 are clearly about art 14 claims; are lines 205-8 (claimed effect related to pathogens) referring to functional (art. 13) claims, e.g. immune defences? Throughout the guidance, a clearer distinction could be made between DRR claims (e.g. ln 203-5) and functional claims (e.g. ln 226-35). For DRR claims, the data needed primarily demonstrate reduction of a risk factor; does it mean that the effect on the disease outcome (disease risk) is secondary, e.g. only supportive, and even not necessary? Would, for functional claims, a reduced number of pathogens be sufficient, or is an effect on a clinical outcome needed as well? In other words, should the \"as well as\" (ln 228) be understood as and or and/or? Meaning, if positive results are available on incidence, duration and/or severity of infection (e.g. diarrhea), would that be enough to make a functional claim such as \"defences against pathogens in the GI tract\", without having to show a reduced number of pathogens, because implicit from the effect on the infection? Apart from that clinical outcomes are in the end what counts, it may often be almost impossible to demonstrate reduction of pathogens, e.g. in children where sampling might be difficult or non-ethical. Ln 209-25: the vast majority of the organisms listed by the NDA are food-borne pathogens that normally do not reside in the gastrointestinal tract of the general healthy population. Would individuals who are carriers for these organisms still be considered as representative for the general population? Ln 232-3: \"effects on intestinal permeability (\u2026) are in themselves insufficient for the substantiation of the claim\". In order for a pathogen to invade and translocate to extra-intestinal tissues, it has to pass the intestinal barrier, the integrity of which is essential for human health. Thus, strengthening the epithelial barrier function could be considered a beneficial physiological effect to substantiate a functional claim related to the improvement of normal defence against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. The Cr-EDTA test as an example is considered a valid marker to assess intestinal barrier function. Supporting Publications 2011:136",

L279-86: As indeed vaccines are usually produced with adjuvants that are already very effective in stimulating protective antibody titres, it is very difficult to demonstrate any further stimulating effect by food constituents. Can claims be substantiated by studies with \"non efficient\" vaccines (e.g. ETEC vaccine)? Must the claim specify the specific pathogen (e.g. defence against E. coli ETEC), or could the effect be generalised (e.g. defence against pathogens)? Is it relevant for health if a food constituent increases antibody titres within the \"protected\" range? Could that be seen as improving normal function of the immune system? L283: Does \"as well as\" express \"and\", or \"and/or\"? L287-92: Can the Panel give insight in the criteria that have resulted in this list? We observe that it differs from PASSCLAIM conclusions; can the Panel explain? In particular, two parameters have been reported, in several publications, to be associated with risks of infections: low NK cell activity, and a decline or deficiency in sIgA. A consistent effect on such parameters could be considered as evidence of reinforcement of immune defences and/or improved normal function of the immune system, and is therefore relevant for a related function claim. The only example mentioned for stimulation of protective antibody titres is derived from medicine. It would be more helpful to have an additional example in relationship to nutrition. The use of the term \"incidence\" as an outcome measure is not clear. Incidence is a measure of the risk of developing a new condition (disease) within a specified period of time. This refers, however, to the development of disease itself. An example for a clinical measure for allergy could be the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis scale (SCORAD), a clinical tool for assessing the severity of atopic dermatitis. Many vaccines are multivalent and individuals may respond to some of the included antigenic variants and not others. An increase in the number of antigenic variants to which the individual responds should also be considered beneficial.",

First, we would like to comment on the general content of the guidance: Regarding the beneficial physiological effect, could EFSA provide the criteria applied to evaluate the extend (is/may/might/is not) to which a claimed effect is considered beneficial physiological effect? What is the final outcome of the assessment \"might be a beneficial physiological effect\" for a health claim on healthy people? For studies/ outcome measures that are considered appropriate for the substantiation of health claim, the document provides guidance on which markers are considered appropriate by the EFSA but: -neither on method used to measure these outcomes, Example: for claim on bowel function, appropriate outcome measures of the claimed effect in human studies considered by the EFSA include transit time.

This is an important step forward and LABIP sees this as a start of a scientific dialogue with industry. The guidance is not, however a representative list of acceptable benefits to health or of studies and outcome measures/endpoints that would support substantiation of a claim. This means that there still are many uncertainties when initiating a research program or filing a dossier. Therefore there is a real need for a scientific dialogue, for instance by allowing applicants to present their dossier and/or strategy for a dossier to the panel. LABIP is surprised to see that e.g. the ILSI initiative leading to the PASSCLAIM paper by Cummings et al. (2004) on Gut health and immunity was not mentioned even once in the guidance document. From the opinions of EFSA now published it becomes clear that only RCT\"s are considered to deliver relevant evidence to substantiate a health beneficial effect. This is typical for drug development, but may not necessarily be applicable to nutritional interventions. The current EFSA approach does not leave space for the subtle effects that nutrition has on health. Nutrition is not a medical treatment aimed at solving a health issue. Nutrition is not expected to lead to acute or immediate responses, as drugs do.",

Molecular approaches in combination with in vitro and animal models are yielding good results but are discounted as not applicable to the human host. Most questions of physiology cannot be answered via human studies given ethical and scientific constraints so there must be some accommodation. \u2022 Mead Johnson welcomes an in-depth discussion with the experts on this specific topic. Line 190-200: The document lists a series of pathogens that if encountered in a clinical trial would severely compromise the health and wellbeing of the host and no addition of probiotic, prebiotic or functional nutrient is likely to affect the outcome. If significant populations of most of these pathogens are present in a clinical trial, first and foremost we are not dealing with a healthy population and second, the participants are likely to become ill. With some of these pathogens, the infective dose is small enough that a reduction in a log would not interfere with their capacity to cause disease in infants. Few labs have the expertise to deal with such microbes and their occurrence in the general population is likely to be low enough that detection is unlikely. It seems more reasonable to work with experts to define the constituents of a \"healthy\" microbiota and propose that any nutritional intervention that shifts the microbiota toward that pattern be considered an appropriate outcome. For similar reasons the reduction of detectable microbial toxins as acceptable surrogates is not appropriate. In addition, the presence of pathogens is likely not the only risk factor in the development of infectious disease. This is where the specific patterns of cytokines, immune cell populations, etc. could reflect a fully functioning immune system. Appropriate targets (patterns) need to be defined. In conclusion: any numerical reference in terms of reduction of pathogens and potential reduced risk of infection/disease cannot be substantiated from a scientific point of view. \u2022 Mead Johnson does not agree with the 1 log reduction of pathogens as outcome parameter for immune function and does not see \"a microbiologically relevant reduction of pathogens\", as an appropriate outcome measure for human clinical trials, particularly with infants",

One of the main aspects that is lacking in this guidance is the general scientific accepted view that the composition of the intestinal microbiota in general is quite important for the health status of people. Much literature has shown that stability and diversity of the microbiota is beneficial for a healthy life. It is also well described that the relatively stable microbiota is negatively influenced by different factors like antibiotic use, stress, travelling and use of medicines. Restoring these effects is proven to be beneficial. In the guidance, nothing is mentioned concerning this subject. The only adopted biomarker in this field is, according to the guidance, the inhibition of specific pathogens. Adopting this biomarker instead of the support of a healthy, rich and stable microbiota does again confirm the disease-oriented approach EFSA has in executing the health claim regulation.",

In line with that, also people suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases like IBD and IBS and people \"suffering\" from metabolic syndrome would be considered as relatively healthy people but are just specific target groups. All these people are subgroups of the complete population, and their health will benefit by taking nutritional products with health claims. In the guidance the NDA Panel considers that the population group for which health claims are intended is the general (healthy) population. Furthermore it is mentioned that applications that specify target groups other than the general population are the subject of ongoing discussion. By this statement one would exclude thus the subgroups as outlined before (IBS/IBD/metabolic syndrome \"patients). Based on all above mentioned critical notes we come to the conclusion that this guidance is very late however we appreciate this guidance as a positive reaction on all comments the stakeholders gave on the regulation and how EFSA handled it. Nevertheless, this guidance should not be a way whereby EFSA tries to get etrospectively approval from the industry on the comments they have made the last four years and the underlying basis for their rejections\u2026. All this is a missed chance for a firm assessment process, based on open scientific reasoning.. However, this could be overcome when EFSA adopted a procedure wherein the applicant and EFSA can communicate about the claim and the presented data, where scientific arguments can be exchanged and where additional data can be presented. EFSA should in that sense learn from the ways notified bodies judge about medical devices. Such a transparent procedure will prevent the impasse an applicant is faced with and will give EFSA the opportunity to enter in a learning process. As stated above, currently EFSA uses the pharmaceutical paradigm in evaluating the presented evidence. NPN does not agree with this on ethical, conceptual and scientific grounds. We would from that perspective highly recommend EFSA, and especially the NDA panel, to consult more scientists in the field of nutrition and microbiology so a peer reviewed opinion by scientis in the field of microbiology and therefore general accepted scientific opinion is established.",

            "text": "General comments Of course NPN appreciates the fact that EFSA is finally listening to the concerns from the market, but again a lot of remarks can be made on the guidelines issued. In this letter we will just keep our comments at a more general level, although we also support the more detailed feedback as provided by Dr. Ger Rijkers and the EHPM. The major comment from a scientific point of view is that nutrition (including food supplements, functional foods, etc.) has a complete different working mechanism in the body than pharmaceutical products do. From a pharmaceutical approach, products are developed to target a specific receptor and by that might interfere with a certain mechanism of action. Nutrition is focussed on health and maintenance of the healthy situation by a much more gradual and multifactorial approach. Health claims for nutritional products should therefore not be judged in a medicinal way. To point \"biomarkers\" for nutritional effects is for that reason quite difficult and maybe impossible (i.e. what would be the biomarker for homeostasis?). In our view this is one of the main reasons that its opinions are received by the scientific community with so much comment. The guidance as proposed now is in our opinion therefore too narrow in possibilities. Another major comment on the guidance is that it confuses the applicants and thus still gives no clearness on the evidence that is required to support a health claim. The following quote is an example of the non-information presented in this guidance and clearly illustrates the impasse an applicant is faced with: For disease risk reduction claims studies that show only a reduction in incidence or duration of infection(s) would not constitute evidence for a reduction of the risk factor (e.g. numbers of pathogens). However, clinical outcomes (e.g. number of episodes of infection, severity of symptoms, or duration of infection such as indicated by diarrhoea diagnosed as infectionrelated using specific criteria), demonstrated in human intervention studies could be supportive of the claimed effect related to pathogens. This quote suggests that a specific product reducing the incidence of infection does not fulfil EFSA\"s demand because there is no proof of a reduction of a risk factor while the same product showing reduction in the numbers of episodes of infection could be supportive of the claimed effect related to the product. We do not think there is any expert capable of discriminating between \"reducing the incidence of infection\" and \"reducing the numbers of episodes of infection\". Moreover, in the absence of a clear procedure (where communication is an important part of) the applicant can only guess what EFSA means with this quote and whether the phrase \"could be supportive\" has any other meaning than its doublespeak character suggests: \"will be rejected nevertheless\". More discrepancy in the guidance is in the fact that the guidance states that a health claim only could be approved when proven effects have been shown on influencing a certain biomarker that is biologically plausible for a certain health effect (clinical results seem to be not even necessary).Nevertheless, when critically reading this guidance, the only \"biomarkers\" considered to be proven are on bowel function (but even that is only focussing on constipation and what about diarrhoea?) and on inhibition of specific pathogens. Furthermore the guidance stays very reticent and careful in mentioning that certain effects could be beneficial. It seems that EFSA makes hereby use of a catch-22-principle, all the way supporting rejection of the majority if not all claims. General comments NPN would hereby like to react on the recently published draft guidance for health claims to gut and immune function, as published in September 2010 in the EFSA Journal. Principally we support the fact that health-and disease-risk-reduction claims on nutritional products should only be communicated to the consumers when there is evidence for the beneficial effects by those products. In line with this, members of NPN, for example Winclove Bio Industries (as SME) invested a lot in performing research on its bacterial strains and final probiotic formulations and subsequently on writing EFSA dossiers. During the assessment, EFSA was unclear about the requirements, has changed them during the procedure and was not willing to communicate with us about the evidence a product should have to get its health claim approved. As stressed also in our letter to Mr. Mathioudakis of April this year (which was even accompanied by a support letter of our Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports) the way the health claim regulation is currently executed results mainly in loss of confidence of the industry and slow their willingness to invest in innovative products with higher health properties.Besides negatively influencing the industry also other stakeholders and the final consumers, for whom the regulation was initially set up, are harmed by the way the regulation is now executed. The estimation of today is that over 90% of all health claims will be rejected. Even more alarming is the situation with respect to health claim applications for probiotics and prebiotics, since not a single claim has been approved so far. For the main part health claims on probiotics were purely rejected on the fact that the strains were not characterised sufficiently. Nevertheless, during the whole procedure it is never made clear which were the requirements for \"sufficiently characterising\" nor was there (until quite a few products were rejected) the possibility to provide EFSA with the additional requested information. To get already ahead of feedback on the EFSA\"s draft guidance, not even in that proposed guidance document assistance is given on how to characterize the active ingredients. After much comments from stakeholders on the way the EFSA judges, EFSA\"s rejections based on beforehand unclear requirements and EFSA\"s unwillingness to communicate, last month a draft guidance on the scientific requirements for health claims related to gut and immune function was published. The first time a concrete action on many requests from companies is now made, 4 years after launching the claim regulations. From this perspective the timing of publishing the guidance is late.",

Such a definition is important for the discussion on health claims; are we forced to show improved health in healthy people by the consumption of an ingredient or can we show that healthy people can get better easier or have less disease symptoms once they have fallen ill? With the current lack of markers for general health it will be impossible to prove better health in healthy people, but with the resilience concept it might be possible to show that for instance consumption of a probiotic leads to faster recovery from an infection by rotavirus. In other words does the panel consider healthy people that are challenged (e.g. by travelling to high risk countries) a suitable model system to show a health benefit?",

In this paper that expresses the consensus view of many experts as developed during the PASSCLAIM project, we can read: \"A healthy, or balanced, flora is, therefore, one that is predominantly saccharolytic and comprises significant numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (see below).

Apparently there is scientific agreement on what a healthy flora constitutes, even without exactly knowing which species are present and in what numbers. The tables below provide further evidence that the increase in bifidobacteria per se is beneficial and for the many effects associated with this increased level of bifidobacteria. These tables are complied on the basis of available literature data, and it is therefore surprising that the Panel is of the opinion that the available evidence is not sufficient to show the beneficial consequences.

This guidance document supports marker that are clinically (pharmcologically) acknowledged and used. Nutrition and pharmacology are, however, separate disciplines with different approaches (including standards). This document ignores nutritional concepts such as prebiotic or fermentation that are accepted by a large body of nutritional experts in the field. If this current view of the NDA panel is taken for granted, nutritional research from academia and industry will be reduced to targeting defined clinical (= drug) outcomes; investments in nutritional research that is based on markers others than accepted by clinicians would phase-out. When effects themselves are assessed, it requires a broad scientific debate with all expert in the field. The way this Guidance document can be commented with 3800 characters/item is not the way to show a willingness for an unbiased scientific approach. We further request that equivalent standards need to be applied (\"validated\") for all nutrients. In other words, currently for several vitamin/mineral claims in the area of immune defence, positive opinions suggest to the consumers that the respective effects have been established following the same criteria which others failed; this is misleading as at least several -if not many/all -were not assessed systematically and specifically for immune defence by any panel yet. If vitamins/minerals will not pass such a validation \"run\" with exactly the same criteria used for other nutrients, we query whether the current approach is appropriate for nutrients. Finally, the conservative mandate of the panel needs to be particularly stressed to put views on effects into perspective that are regarded as beneficial by a large community of nutritional scientists outside the EFSA even though an ultimate consensus may not have been reached. It is the evaluation criteria that have been changed rather than the science. To embrace such a complex and difficult subject as immune system with its multilateral functions the evaluators have to bear in mind that our knowledge of the body\u00b4s immune system is still evolving and there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven false tomorrow... -the immune system is maintaing health by really sophisticated \"network\" comprising many different players who interact with each other to such extent not yet fully understood and therefore insider would expect that for such health category some \"grading of evidence\" should be naturally possible since the limited knowledge can not be conclusive even with the latest \"highest possible standard\" (line 46)of scientific assessment -Therefore the grading of health claims could be the solution and might be arranged in similar way as the US FDA deals with so called \"Qualified Health Claims\"(i.e. \"Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consuption of XY... may reduce the risk\") The yes or no system is not functional in immunity world where modality words are more appropriate and sometimes maitaining a normal immune system means more \"harmonization\" of immune sytem than one-way boosting or mitigating hypersensitivity reactions.

It would be useful if the panel could specify which criteria determine whether or not certain effects in specific subpopulations may be extrapolated to the general population. We propose that important criteria include underlying (patho)physiology principles which also apply in the general population (be it with a different magnitude) and that it is biologically plausible that effects would also benefit the general population (even though benefits may not be immediately measurable). In our opinion, examples that apply for extrapolation to the general population would be: -people with antibiotic-associated diarrhea are an appropriate study group to support claims on gastrointestinal infections (add to paragraph 3.3) -people with traveler''s diarrhea are an appropriate study group to support claims on gastrointestinal infections (add to paragraph 3.3) -people with experimentally induced infections, such as intestinal infections and respiratory tract infections, are an appropriate study group to support claims on the respective infections in the general population Can the panel clarify what is meant by \"sustained over time\" ? Would the effect need to last during the period of intervention, beyond the period of intervention, and would there be any relevant time-span? 200 A decrease of at least 1 log could be meaningful for certain pathogens, however, this cannot be regarded as a generally accepted reduction that has a biological relevance for all pathogens. Some pathogens are pathogenic when present in very low numbers, therefore a decrease smaller than 1 log could be clinically relevant. In other cases, a reduction of 1 log would not be meaningful when compared to the number of microorganisms normally present.

In several situations such changes have been suggested as risk factors for development of disease. An example is the association between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and CRP and future cardiovascular and metabolic disease.We propose that claims on reduction of inflammation may be supported by evidence of changes of inflammatory markers back to normal ranges (normal clinical ranges, control group ranges) 1) in a population that is naturally (e.g ageing) outside this normal range, 2) in study populations with specific life styles (e.g diet) or life events (e.g. injury) 3) in study populations where the response of inflammatory tone following an experimental challenge-model representative for a life style or life event (such as exposure to a high fat meal) is out of normal rangeand that such evidence alone is sufficient to substantiate a claim on improved inflammatory tone Unilever 4.3 Claims on reducing a risk factor for infections or allergy 316-320 As there are no validated risk factors for infections related to immune function or gastrointestinal function, we would welcome a further discussion with the panel and their opinion on how this could be approached.

Examples of these are the reduced NK cell activity and numbers, sIgA levels and the susceptibility of airway infections in elderly, subjects under chronic mental stress and subjects under strenuous exercise. In order to arrive at the qualification of a risk factor we propose the following criteria to establish such markers as acceptable risk factor for infection susceptibility: 1) demonstration of a statistically significant effect on both an infection outcome and a biomarker in the same study 2) demonstration of a statistically significant effect on both an infection outcome and a biomarker in the same study as well as a biologically plausible hypothesis linking the biomarker with the infection outcome 3) demonstration of changes of immune parameters (or other biomarkers) in sub populations associated with demonstrated compromised resistance to infections Outcome of a public consultation on a draft guidance on the scientific requirements for gut and immune function claims 158 Supporting Publications 2011:136",

How would such risk profiles be considered by EFSA? 312-315 We appreciate the fact that a reduction in the number of pathogens at the infectious site, (such as the gastrointestinal tract for a number of pathogens that are listed in 3.3) can be used as risk factor in a disease risk reduction claim. As we welcome the list of microorganisms that are considered pathogenic or toxicogenic in the GI section, we would appreciate to see a list of microorganisms that can be considered as pathogens relevant to the general population with respect to infections occurring at other sites in the body, such as the airways, urinary tract and skin. Such microorganisms may include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenzavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus among others and may be measured in nasal lavage, bronchial fluid, urine, depending on the primary infectious site, to support both claims related to defense against pathogens and reducing a risk factor for infection. In addition, as many infections are transmitted via other routes than the primary infectious site and as the reduction of pathogens at distant bodily secretions and surfaces would reduce the risk of (re)infection, we suggest that the list \"suitable samples\" may include distant bodily secretions and surfaces including but not limited to: -Fecal material for non-GI pathogens: e.g presence of airway pathogens here may be an indication for infection or a route of transmission (e.g De Jong, Pediatr Infect Dis J 2008;27: S54) In fact, this is comparable to what is described for C. tetani under 3.3, as GI pathogen, but infectious via wounds -Hands: Hands are a primary route of contact transmission for many infections.

Nevertheless, this guidance should not be a way whereby EFSA tries to get retrospectively approval from the industry on the judgements they have made the last four years and the underlying basis for their rejections\u2026. All this is a missed chance for a firm assessment process, based on open scientific reasoning. However, this could be overcome when EFSA adopted a procedure wherein the applicant and EFSA can communicate about the claim and the presented data, where scientific arguments can be exchanged and where additional data can be presented. EFSA should in that sense learn from the ways notified bodies judge about medical devices. Such a transparent procedure will prevent the impasse an applicant is faced with and will give EFSA the opportunity to enter in a learning process. As stated above, currently EFSA uses the pharmaceutical paradigm in evaluating the presented evidence. Winclove does not agree with this on ethical, conceptual and scientific grounds. We would from that perspective highly recommend EFSA, and especially the NDA panel, to recruit more scientists in the field of nutrition and microbiology, since products like probiotics (but also other food supplements and functional foods) have a nutritional approach and should be judged from that perspective and by a team that has knowledge of these products and the way they act.

Much literature has shown that stability and diversity of the microbiota is beneficial for a healthy life. It is also well described that the relatively stable microbiota is negatively influenced by different factors like antibiotic use, stress, travelling and use of medicines. Restoring these effects is proven to be beneficial. In the guidance, nothing is mentioned concerning this subject. The only adopted biomarker in this field is, according to the guidance, the inhibition of specific pathogens.

In this letter we will just keep our comments at a more general level, although we also support the more detailed feedback as provided by Dr. Ger Rijkers and the EHPM. The major comment from a scientific point of view is that nutrition (including food supplements, functional foods, etc.) has a complete different working mechanism in the body than pharmaceutical products do. From a pharmaceutical approach, products are developed to target a specific receptor and by that might interfere with a certain mechanism of action. Nutrition is focussed on health and maintenance of the healthy situation by a much more gradual and multifactorial approach. Health claims for nutritional products should therefore not be judged in a medicinal way. To point \"biomarkers\" for nutritional effects is for that reason quite difficult and maybe impossible (i.e. what would be the biomarker for homeostasis?). EFSA misses this point completely and in our view this is one of the main reasons that its opinions are received by the scientific community with so much comment. The guidance as proposed now is in our opinion therefore too narrow in possibilities. Another major comment on the guidance is that it confuses the applicants and thus still gives no clearness on the evidence that is required to support a health claim. The following quote is an example of the non-information presented in this guidance and clearly illustrates the impasse an applicant is faced with: For disease risk reduction claims studies that show only a reduction in incidence or duration of infection(s) would not constitute evidence for a reduction of the risk factor (e.g. numbers of pathogens). However, clinical outcomes (e.g. number of episodes of infection, severity of symptoms, or duration of infection such as indicated by diarrhoea diagnosed as infection-related using specific criteria), demonstrated in human intervention studies could be supportive of the claimed effect related to pathogens. This quote suggests that a specific product reducing the incidence of infection does not fulfil EFSA\"s demand because there is no proof of a reduction of a risk factor while the same product showing reduction in the numbers of episodes of infection could be supportive of the claimed effect related to the product. We do not think there is any expert capable of discriminating between \"reducing the incidence of infection\" and \"reducing the numbers of episodes of infection\". Moreover, in the absence of a clear procedure (where communication is an important part of) the applicant can only guess what EFSA means with this quote and whether the phrase \"could be supportive\" has any other meaning than its doublespeak character suggests: \"will be rejected nevertheless\". More discrepancy in the guidance is in the fact that the guidance states that a health claim only could be approved",

During the assessment, EFSA was unclear about the requirements, has changed them during the procedure and was not willing to communicate with us about the evidence a product should have to get its health claim approved. As stressed also in our letter to Mr. Mathioudakis of April this year (which was even accompanied by a support letter of our Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports) the way the health claim regulation is currently executed results mainly in loss of confidence of the industry and slow their willingness to invest in innovative products with higher health properties. Besides negatively influencing the industry also other stakeholders and the final consumers, for whom the regulation was initially set up, are harmed by the way the regulation is now executed. The estimation of today is that over 90% of all health claims will be rejected. Even more alarming is the situation with respect to health claim applications for probiotics and prebiotics, since not a single claim has been approved so far. For the main part health claims on probiotics were purely rejected on the fact that the strains were not characterised sufficiently. Nevertheless, during the whole procedure it is never made clear which were the requirements for \"sufficiently characterising\" nor was there (until quite a few products were rejected) the possibility to provide EFSA with the additional requested information. To get already ahead of feedback on the EFSA\"s draft guidance, not even in that proposed guidance document assistance is given on how to characterize the active ingredients.

Gut permeability is a very important risk factor for developing (chronic low-grade) inflammation, ln 232 indicates that this is not sufficient.

However the possible \"Claims on gastrointestinal discomfort\" (Ln 177-182) is confusing as IBS is in principle a disease as diagnosed by the Rome II diagnostic criteria in 2000. It is generally accepted that there is no definition for \"healthy\" indicating that it is relatively impossible to measure physiological beneficial effects in this group. E.g., are obese people healthy? In clinical trials does this mean that, to measure any results, healthy people first have to be induced with an illness? There needs to be a broader possible test group then only people suffering from IBS which can easily be extrapolated to the healthy population in general",

These regional differences of butyrate concentrations are taught to have implications towards the occurrence of diseases, such as colon cancer and UC, with the distal colon demonstrated to be more frequently and severely affected. Moreover, the studies of Vanhoutvin et al.(2)andHamer  et al. (3)  showed beneficial effects in the rectum and sigmoid colon in healthy volunteers following rectal administration of butyrate at physiologically relevant doses. In view of the essential role of butyrate in the colon function, it is undeniable that well tolerated nutritional interventions providing increases of colonic butyrate within the physiological range are beneficial to health. In human intervention trials the assessment of luminal butyrate levels is practically restricted to the measurement of fecal butyrate levels. Although the analysis of the butyrate levels in the feces may not allow concluding on the butyrate production throughout the entire colon, it is indicative of the butyrate levels in the distal colon, which particularly benefits from increased presence of luminal butyrate.

Furthermore, a reduction may be irrelevant if initial levels are high; the subject may still be colonized with sufficient pathogens to become/remain ill.

What really counts is reducing levels of potential pathogens to levels below where they can cause disease ?

How is it possible to lead studies in healthy humans to demonstrate a beneficial effect against infections? For this topic, it is more feasible to carry out studies on animal models, with a level of well-defined contamination. Will these studies be examined and taken into account by EFSA? -Human studies on potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as Clostridium or Candida should be subject to the same criticisms as those on the lactic flora or bifidobacteria (variability from one individual to another, subject to environmental factors ....).

Reddy (1998) Disagreement with EFSA approach on the evaluation of microbiota status EFSA states that only reducing the numbers of 190 specific pathogenic microorganisms is a beneficial physiological effect. We disagree with this position because a reduction of pathogen can occur when the final result is that these microorganisms remain dominant in the microbiota. This is not a sign of a healthy intestinal microflora. Scientists of PASSCLAIM had concluded that a healthy, or balanced, intestinal flora is one that is numerically dominates by bacteria such bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (Cummings et al, 2004) . Therefore our position is that maintaining pathogens at subdominant level, through the increase of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, is a better indication of a healthy intestinal microflora than merely reducing the numbers of pathogens as proposed by EFSA. EFSA proposal of using pathogens reduction as marker of microflora status raises the question to know how to measure specific pathogens on a healthy population.

It would be much clearer also to state the examples given in part 3.3 again in the light of the focus of part 4.1Outcome of a public consultation on a draft guidance on the scientific requirements for gut and immune function claims The only mentioned example for stimulation of protective antibody titres is derived from medicine / pharma -namely \"vaccination\".

Furthermore, a reduction may be irrelevant if initial levels are high; the subject may still be colonized with sufficient pathogens to become/remain ill.

What really counts is reducing levels of potential pathogens to levels below where they can cause disease.Lines 185-186: \"It is not possible to define the exact numbers of the different bacterial groups\" according EFSA.

We think the document represents a good start and sincerely welcome the initiative.

Additionally line 114 a propos risk factors, could EFSA clarify in its guidance whether it would consider bowel habit and transit time as risk factors for disease (constipation/motility)? We also feel some clarity is needed to the title of section 2.1. Beneficial physiological effect. This should be extended to clarify that EFSA is referring to beneficial physiological effects in the context of specific health claims relating to functional benefits and reduction of disease risk factors. We would suggest ''Beneficial physiological effects in function and disease risk reduction claims''. We would also seek further guidance on section 3.3 in the context of gastrointestinal microbiota. Currently there appears to be conflicting scientific views from academic experts in the field of ''prebiotics'' as to what constitutes a ''beneficial physiological effect'' in the context of gastro-intestinal microbiota ''prebiotic'' health claims. We hope this can be discussed in detail by all experts at the forthcoming EFSA Technical meeting on the 2nd December so that the scientific specifics involved can be ironed out and clarity brought to these claims for the benefit of current and future development.",

The draft guidance on gut and immune function claims assert that a reduction in pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in stool would represent an appropriate outcome upon which to base a health claim. A pathogen such as Listeria monocytogenes (the genus Listeria is included on the list of approved pathogens, line 211) is not normally present in the stool of healthy individuals. A 2005 study identified Listeria monocytogenes in only one stool sample of 827 tested (0.12%) (1). This would make it impossible to gather a meaningful cohort of carriers for a human intervention. In addition, carriage can be sporadic rather than long-term (2). Obviously Listeria monocytogenes cannot be safely administered in human studies because of the risk of initiating disease. This is especially important in the case of listeriosis which has a very high mortality rate of ~20%. This essentially rules out any prospect of ever demonstrating a reduction in the levels of Listeria monocytogenes in the stool of humans. However, a food or treatment which reduces the risk of listeriosis could prove very significant in terms of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with Listeria monocytogenes. This is an unmet need given that recent evidence shows that the incidence of listeriosis is on the increase in the EU (3). I ask that the EFSA NDA Panel should accept that animal studies or the use of surrogate bacteria in humans should be considered as sufficient evidence on which to base a claim, for those specific organisms where no alternative is ever likely to be possible. For example, demonstrating a significant reduction of bacterial numbers in stool in animal models of listeriosis (supported by actual reductions in disease outcomes such as lethality), or demonstrating a reduction of deliberately introduced Listeria innocua in humans (if ethical permission could be achieved for such an approach). The use of the genus Listeria in the approved list rather than the species Listeria monocytogenes seems to favour an interpretation that evidence compiled using Listeria innocua would meet the criteria set out in the draft guidance, but it would be helpful if this could be clarified. This is a very important question, since there are risk groups among healthy consumers (e.g. pregnant women, elderly consumers) who could benefit from consuming food designed to reduce risk associated with Listeria monocytogenes, but will never be able to receive such foods if human trials with Listeria monocytogenes are mandatory. Food is the most obvious vehicle to address this risk, since the rarity of listeriosis does not lend itself to vaccination of prophylactic chemotherapeutic strategies. Food which could reduce the risk of developing this often fatal disease would represent a low risk, high benefit strategy. The same issues may also apply to other pathogens, but this comment is specifically addressed at Listeria monocytogenes and listeriosis. whether the studies used (an) appropriate outcome measure(s) of the claimed effect. This only is an appropriate formulation for FUTURE studies. For existing studies, the outcome measures are the one which justify the scientific conclusion. When the proposed health claim is at variance with these scientific conclusions, the health claim should be re-worded but not the study disqualified.Lines 157-159For this, the NDA Panel considers what is generally accepted in the relevant research fields and consults experts from various disciplines, as appropriate. I support this approach, provided that this is done UPFRONT. In such a way guidelines can be designed and agreed upon.",

In cases where this is not possible because the activity is delivered by a natural extract comprising many constituents, characterization can also comprise of characterization using specified marker molecules in combination with demonstration of consistent biological efficacy using a bioassay relevant to the proposed mechanism of action. The EFSA initiative to provide guidelines for health claims is timely and appropriate.In this general framework a further effort should be made to better define selected principles and outcomes. Specifically, here is a series of reflections for consideration related to some open issues. 1. Quality of clinical studies a. Better definition of appropriate study population in relation to the general population is warranted. b. Infants and children pose specific challenges related to maturation of the immune system, the intestinal barrier function, etc. Therefore addressing the specificity related to child health would be advisable. c. Aspects related to the quality of clinical trial data need to be better defined. These include the size and design of a single large scale pivotal study; the use of meta-analysis and their relative importance; the importance of surrogate endpoints and the relative weight of secondary end points turning out positive in the presence of a non-met primary endpoint; biological plausibility. Indeed, mechanism of action and biological plausibility are key elements for final judgement and are at present underestimated. 2. Effects on the immune system a. I share the view that changes in markers of immunity including number and function of leukocytes, cytokines etc. are insufficient for a claim of beneficial effects on immunity per se. It should be clarified whether correlates of immunity are indeed valuable readouts for a claim in the presence of positive beneficial clinical response. b. As indicated by the Panel, altered susceptibility to infectious agents is not necessarily representative of changes in immunity. It would be important to better delineate dissociations of the two and the appropriate type of data establishing a link. c. It would be appropriate to better define conditions under which results of separate studies, addressing for instance clinical versus biological outcomes, can be linked in a claim. d. Vaccine studies are widely used and meet an important health need. It would be helpful to better delineate the vaccines for which validated cut off values are indeed considered; the relationships between stimulation of antibody titres in response to vaccination and resistance in the context of natural infection; the relative weight of average increments in titres in a population versus frequency of individuals obtaining protective titres. e. A general issue relates to the specific aspects of immunity affected in the general context of \"natural defences\". This is an important question given the complex networking of the immune system. Even for conventional classic adjuvants, the specific claim would be hard to define. f. In relation to defence against pathogens, better definition of criteria for a claim is warranted, including the sufficiency of clinical outcomes of infection, the reduction of pathogen load in disease, the reduction of commensal pathogens versus pathogens in infection, the importance of markers of wellness (e.g. fever, appetite).Outcome of a public consultation on a draft guidance on the scientific requirements for gut and immune function claims Lines 268-73 The claim that a product improves the immune system should be accepted if supported by several independent lines of evidence 1. well controlled intervention studies (2 or 3)on healthy individuals of different ages showing increased resistance to common infectious diseases as revealed by shorter duration of disease and reduction of fever 2.multiple independent studies on healthy individuals showing: (i) increased production of neutralizing antibodies following routine influenza vaccination (ii) enhancement of NK cell function/ maintenance of their circulating level during stress episodes (iii) enhancement of the stimulated oxydative burst of phagocytes All the these published observations on the multiple facets of the protective mechanisms against infection should be taken together to indicate that the product has favorable effect on the immune response.",

Line 188: As a general principle I vehementy disagree with the contention that increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is not of benefit to the host. My view is that this ignores the vast body of literature (>7000 published articles) and research on probiotics and prebiotics. This field has good quality science and techniques to back up mechanistic explanations of effect. Many trials are conducted at a high quality with rigorous control. To me, using increased populations and activities of these microbial groups in the gut is as useful a biomarker of improved health as most others. If we do not strive to capatlise upon this with the functional food concept then ultimately it will be to the detriment of European consumer health.Here are more specific comments: 1) Lines 211-225: These pathogens can be harboured without ill effects, so in many people reducing their numbers would be meaningless in terms of health. My view is that asymptomatic carriage is at least partly explained by increased populations of microbes such as the bifidobacteria. and why probiotics and prebiotics should target such components of the microbiota.2) Line 200: The one log reduction figure does not make sense to me, given that the pathogens exert effects at different doses e.g. shigella (mentioned) can cause dysentery at 10-100 cells so reduction by one log in this regard would mean nothing.3) Lines 211-216: Showing a one log decrease in the viruses would be hard to prove, as they need living cells to survive. 4) Line 218: H. pylori is not an environmental pathogen. 5) Line 218: C. tetani is by no means just a wound pathogen. 6) Generally, the document comes across as viewing the microbes in isolation (e.g. a laboratory) not the complex ecosystem of the gut. 7) The way to reduce these pathogens, at least the bacteria, is through antibiotics. But, the document relates to food. I cannot foresee how any food will suppress pathogens by more than a log value. 8) By the time these acute pathogens cause symptoms they are on their way out. So, eliciting a reduction then is of no 1. \"beneficial physiological effect\" EFSA has to define more clearly what is a \"beneficial physiological effect\" and the criteria it applies to judge if a claimed effect is beneficial or not. \"Beneficial physiological effect\" is an indeterminate concept, not only from a scientific point of view, but also from a legal point of view. This definition is very important, as it is a step that precedes the assessment.2. \"health\" or \"healthy population\"Outcome of a public consultation on a draft guidance on the scientific requirements for gut and immune function claims 163 Supporting Publications 2011:136",

Most toxigenic organisms are not carried in the gut of healthy people. Rather, they are ingested and induce disease. Thus, in most cases the disease is already occurring when a probiotic is administered. The panel needs to define a certain scenario so that anyone wishing to make such a claim knows what studies might be required.203. I perhaps don''t understand this correctly, but the faster resolution of a disease may not necessarily correlate with reduction in pathogen count in the stool, and why would this be the outcome anyway? It is the clinical evidence that is much more important.218. There is a danger in defining some ''pathogens'' such as H. pylori, which may be in some people not pathogenic.266.

EFSA often gave negative opinions against a number of applications based on incomplete designs/protocols such as low number of subjects and short study periods. However, EFSA did not show any reason of this negative evaluation, and thus we must say it is not fare. EFSA should show the basis of this evaluation clearly. This is also the case in this guidance document. We strongly recommend to describe the actual requirements of a appropriate study design.Yakult Europe B.V. General comments 1. General considerations (a) Dialogue is essential in case of \"case by case\" or in case EFSA does not clarify the criteria of assessment. There are instances of the words \"may\" \"might\" and \"can\" in the document, as well as \"case by case\", which makes applicants uncertain what are needed for application. We strongly suggest having dialogue with EFSA during the assessment process.(b) The guidance should give applicants clear guidance to fulfill EFSA requirements and not just consider examples from dossiers that have already been dealt with by EFSA. We consider that it is essential that a wide range of experts in gut and immune function research are consulted and involved in the amendment of this guidance document after this public consultation and the meeting on 2 December 2010.(c) We consider it would be very advisable to collect and combine all learnings from existing guidance in this area (FOSHU, FDA, etc.) , and this will enable global harmonization of health claim regulation on food products like pharmaceutical products.(d) We believe that claims for foods should be different in several key aspects from those for medicinal products because of a basic difference between medicines and foods. Especially, the benefits of foods in terms of measurable outcome may not always have as great a magnitude as medicinal products, especially when measured in \"healthy\" people.(e) Scientific papers accepted in respected peer review journals should be taken as a clear indication of the quality of the research studies and their findings. Clarification is needed on what value EFSA places on peer-reviewed publication, and why findings from such papers cannot be accepted. 2. Consensus (a) If it is accepted that a state of health of general population is fluctuating, most people who consider themselves healthy experience, at various times in their lives, periods of sub-optimal health due to age, lifestyle, and physical, mental or environmental stresses. Then, is it accepted to use appropriate study population groups with sub-optimal health as representatives of the general population to substantiate health benefits. This enables a clear clinical endpoint to be measured. Examples of groups include the elderly, sports people, smokers, pregnant women. Would populations with common pathologies (diabetes, allergy ...) be also considered part of the general population? Can a population under challenge also be used?Outcome of a public consultation on a draft guidance on the scientific requirements for gut and immune function claims 171 Supporting Publications 2011:136",

            "text": "As a definition or appearance of constipation, the guidance indicates i) longer transit time, ii) less frequent bowel movements, iii) reduced faecal bulk and iv) harder stools. However, there is no clear indication of the normal range of these bowel functions described. In addition, changes in these parameters do not necessarily mean the beneficial physiological effects judging from the description that \"Changes in bowel function within the normal range might be considered beneficial physiological effects.\" We definitely need more clarification of the criteria of evaluation by EFSA. For instance, can a group of people with light constipation or with functional constipation be a general population? At least EFSA needs dialogue with applicants if it does not provide the clear guideline.As described in the line 163 of the draft guidance, the sentence in line 167-168 should reads \"Appropriate outcome measures of the claimed effect in human studies include transit time, frequency of bowel movement, stool bulk, and stool consistency.\" The reference for that is as follow: Lewis SJ, Heaton KW. Scand. J. Gastronenterol. 32, 9: 920-4, 1997 .Yakult Europe B.V. 3.2 Claims on gastrointestinal discomfort a). Improvement of defecation frequency in constipated subjects. All healthy people experience different periods and severity of constipation through their lives. Such an outcome measure indicates that a food or food ingredient would help maintain a healthy bowel habit. This is the same logic that, in the guidance document, was applied to IBS. b We strongly recommend a thorough consultation with experts of microbiology to re-write this part. The guidance does not address the commensal microbiota but pathogens. Many of these pathogens are not normal inhabitants of the gut. Category A \"Food born pathogen\"(line 211-216) should be clearly distinguished from Category B \"Gastronintestinal pathogen (line 217-219), in terms of guideline required. In some cases, very low numbers of these pathogens cause disease so their detection in the gut or oral cavity itself is already a disease state. On the other hand, several other pathogens are commensal bacteria. Therefore, the assessment criterion of a decrease of more than 1 log is considered as beneficial can not be applicable to all of these pathogens. b). Improvement/maintenance of gut health by maintaining a balanced gut microbiota, particularly levels of bifidobacteria in the young, older people and for people suffering certain minor disorders and by maintaining the gut environment.Although there is no \"optimum\" profile of the intestinal microbiota, several studies show reduced levels of bifidobacteria (and in some case, lactobacilli) are linked to disorders in young children. There is a strong case to argue that maintenance of these bacteria would have health benefits, which are more sustained and long term in a manner appropriate for a functional food. Promoting a \"healthy microbiota\" be considered a health benefit. Similarly, changes in the intestinal microbiota have been linked to many disorders, when comparative analyses have been conducted on healthy and sick people. Maintenance of a healthy microbiota can also be considered a health benefit for other population groups, such as the elderly. Accumulating evidence shows that the biomarkers such as SCFA, pH in the gut associate with the health status. These biomarkers are obviously the products of gut microbiota, and thus can be linked to the microbiota composition. Guidance should be given for the possible health benefits of higher SCFA content and lower pH in the gut. c). Improvement/maintenance of gut health by maintaining the intestinal gut barrier/improving gut permeability What is the reason for EFSA to consider that \"intestinal permeability\" in itself not sufficient as a benefit? Improvement of mucosal barrier function may be considered as more important for a functional food, in preventing infections than reducing the number of potential pathogens in the gut. If the gut permeability is impaired, one consequence can be diarrhoea. A further consequence, associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota, can be raised levels of circulating endotoxin (from Gram-negative bacteria), which has been linked to the onset of various diseases and inflammation. d). Improvement/maintenance of gut health by reducing harmful substances in the gut/ Reduction of microbial metabolites (e.g. in faeces, urine, blood) that are toxigenic or carcinogenic, and therefore could impact on long term health Many studies link toxins or carcinogens produced by the commensal gut microbiota to long term illness, such as cancer. There are a range of data showing that certain microbial metabolites in the gut have toxigenic and/or carcinogenic potential (e.g. phenol, p-cresol, deconjugated bile acids, etc.).

There are also some data showing that certain gut bacteria can neutralise or absorb such toxins; and also shifts in the proportion of certain bacterial groups affects levels of harmful substances in the gut Yakult Europe B.V. 4.1 Claims on the function of the immune system It seems that only the reduction of pathogen and stimulation of vaccination against pathogens are recognized evidence to claim a benefit on immune function, and although reduction of allergic manifestation is indicated as beneficial, no clear outcome measurement parameter is indicated. We feel that this is inadequate and insufficient as a guidance. Especially, the description from line 272 to 278 does not indicate any concrete guideline values for applicants to show as benefits, and thus would like to propose the consultation with experts in the field of infection and allergy to cflarify and revise the current guidance.We also include a few points as examples for further consideration:We would like to emphasize that the innate immune response to infection and cancer development should be considered a beneficial immune function if supported by concomitant favorable clinical outcomes or favorable reduced carcinogenic activity in the colonic content. In these cases, would a marker measured in the incubation period of infection and/or during infection and cancer development, such as NK cell activity/cell count, sIgA and gamma-IFN be considered as a relevant function?Are immunological markers mandatory to substantiate the involvement of the immune system when allergic or infectious manifestations are diagnosed by a trained physician using validated methods within double blind placebo controlled trials? Also here, only the reduction of pathogen is recognized evidence to claim a benefit on immune function. We feel that this also needs further consultation with experts of both fields. Whilst the reduction in incidence as an outcome is clearly beneficial for health, it can be difficult to define a function claim to reflect this benefit without being considered as medicinal. What is the reasoning that a risk factor is mandatory even when the clinical outcome as the reduction of the incidence is available? Would it be impossible to consider that such type of results can be extrapolated to a benefit of increasing long term health, and therefore can be extrapolated to substantiate a function claim, with or without a known risk factor?YLFA International General comments 1 -YLFA welcome the publication by EFSA\"s Panel on dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA panel) of the draft Guidance on the scientific requirements for health claims related to gut and immune function. This communication effort of EFSA is definitively an important step forward. 2 -YLFA request EFSA to provide insight on the approach and reasoning used by the agency not only in the case by case evaluation of applications but in a more global, standard approach which will provide more certainty for the applicants.3 -Need for scientific dialogue with EFSA is therefore still needed, which can be through allowing applicants to present their dossier and/or strategy for dossier to the NDA panel.4 -YLFA request further clarification of what \"whole body of evidence\" will mean. \u2022 YLFA need clarification on which type of clinicals will be taken into account and especially with which weight, number of clinicals, value of secondary outcomes when statistically significant, and value of results on the biological plausibility of the effect.-Foods, unlike drugs, are not intended as solutions to specific problems, but as a contribution to health as an overall part of the diet. In that respect, they often address multiple endpoints to fulfil a complex physiological function. Consequently, a claimed effect can be substantiated by complementary data coming from various appropriate outcomes. This multiplicity of relevant endpoints should be taken into account in agreeing studies when the relevant outcome is a secondary criterion, provided the study is adequately powered and the inclusion criteria are appropriate. -The importance of biological plausibility hardly appears in the panel\"s opinions on gut health and immunity area whereas they are meaningful parts of the overall consistency of the food effect. We believe that scientific data in both human and non-human supporting the biological plausibility of the effect has to be taken into account in the weighing of the evidence, even if mechanisms of actions are not fully elucidated. \u2022 YLFA also need clarification on which population will be considered for clinicals: would populations with common pathologies (diabetes, allergy ...) be considered part of the general population?\u2022 YLFA need to know which magnitude of effect will be considered relevant, taking into account that we are dealing with food and general healthy population and The guidance does not really address microbiota but pathogens, mainly those which contaminate foods and are not normal gut inhabitants. No reference is made to microbiota composition, metabolites or modification and resistance to infection, and we need some guidance as how such claims, which we believe can be beneficial to human health, can be substantiated. The reduction of pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract is recognised as suitable markers to demonstrate a health benefit. A decrease of more than 1log is proposed as a universal threshold, which is questionable as it depends on the pathogen and characteristics of the infection.",
