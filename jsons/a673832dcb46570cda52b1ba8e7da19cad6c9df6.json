LAMP-AuNP and LAMP-STR can detect as low as 9.7 fg (3.2 sea copies) and 7.2 sea copies, respectively, which were lower than PCR (97 fg or 32 sea copies). The excellent performance of these new assays was demonstrated in food samples using crude DNA lysates. While the culture method detected 10 4 CFU/g in ground pork and 10 CFU/mL in milk in 5-7 days, LAMP-AuNP could detect down to 10 CFU/g for both samples in 27 minutes. Analyzing 80 pork and milk samples revealed that the LAMP-AuNP showed 100% sensitivity, 97-100% specificity and 97.5-100% accuracy, which were superior to the culture method, and comparable to PCR but without requirement of a thermal cycler. Furthermore, our LAMP-AuNP detect sea at a range below the food safety control (<100 CFU/g). The LAMP-STR quantitated sea in 10-1,000 CFU (7.2-720 copies). Our crude DNA lysis combined with LAMP-AuNP/STR present effective point-of-care detection and facilitate appropriate control strategies.",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus strains with the staphylococcal enterotoxin A gene (sea) bacteriophage, are a common cause of foodborne disease and outbreaks worldwide including the United States and countries of the European Union 1-5 . In Thailand, one of the largest outbreaks occurred in 2009 reporting 573 illnesses due to consumption of contaminated sticky rice custard 6 . S. aureus is commonly found in soil, water, air, as well as human respiratory tract and skin. The sea toxin is relatively heat stable (e.g. up to 100 \u00b0C for 30 min) therefore, food contamination generally occurs when cooking is performed without sufficient hygiene. Frequently reported contaminated foods include dairy products (milk, cheese, ice cream, etc.), and meat 7,8 . Importantly, contaminated food may not be easily identified by sensory evaluation such as odor or appearance. Clinical symptoms from sea food poisoning include vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and dysentery, often within 1-6 h after consumption. Occasional symptoms include sweating, chills, rectal bleeding, and shock 9-11 . The severity of illness depends on the concentration of the toxin. Consumption of merely 20-100 ng of sea toxin can cause clinical symptoms and >100 ng may be fatal, therefore a sensitive method of sea detection is important for food safety control. Detection is usually open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:7768 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64710-0 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ performed using culture based on a selective Baird-Parker medium 12 , with a limit of <100 bacterial colony forming unit (CFU) per g or mL of food or drink 13-15 . Nonetheless, this culture method supports both the growth of sea and non-sea strains, and thus lacks specificity in detecting the pathogenic sea strains. In addition, some food ingredients can affect the ability to culture leading to false negative results.",

            "text": "An alternative method for highly specific analysis of a food-borne pathogen is the nucleic acid-based assay, which generally requires amplification prior to detection to achieve the desired sensitivity. LAMP presents an attractive alternative to traditional amplification methods like PCR due to its low cost, ease-of-use and rapidity. Most importantly, the expensive thermal cycler and specialized kits for DNA extraction and purification are not required. The strand displacement characteristic of the Bst DNA polymerase and the loop-intercalating primers allow amplification of the targets at a single temperature with high sensitivity (e.g. 10-100 genome copies). The product can be visualized, albeit indirectly, by the formation of magnesium pyrophosphate as a white precipitate 16 . Goto et al. 2 . has previously developed a LAMP technique to detect sea, seb, sec and sed genes, and reported that it is more sensitive and specific than PCR by an order of magnitude 2,17 . However, previous analyses of LAMP results indirectly performed by monitoring the formation of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate showed limited accuracy since precipitate formation affects reading accuracy. The alternative analysis by agarose gel-electrophoresis requires electrophoresis instrumentation, extra laboratory time (0.5-1.5 h), safety issues due to exposure to high voltage and ethidium bromide, and perhaps false positives due to misamplification 18 . Here, we present the use of a nanogold-appended sea probe (AuNP) specific for the target DNA to eliminate false positives, and increase assay specificity [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The high molar extinction coefficient of the AuNP supports simple visualization by naked eyes. Together, we designed new LAMP primers based on additional sea sequences from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/) along with two inner loop primers that can speed up the amplification by parallel-amplifying DNA loops outward on both ends 25 and determined the optimal reaction conditions. The LAMP-AuNP assay was validated by testing commonly contaminated food samples (ground pork and milk) to show improved specificity and sensitivity 26-28 compared to the standard nucleic acid-based assay (PCR). We also demonstrated that the combination of a simple crude DNA lysis method and LAMP is appropriate for point-of-care and resource-restrained diagnostics. Further, since the visual reading from LAMP-AuNP cannot quantitate the number of bacterial CFU (or copy), which is important when the contamination level is below the food and drink safety control (<100 CFU) but which the hypersensitive LAMP can detect 26,29 , an alternative detection method employing a cationic styryl dye (STR) as a fluorescent DNA stain 30,31 was developed for quantifying the LAMP product. The LAMP-STR can quantify sea levels below 100 CFU, which a conventional culture method could not detect. Our two methods, therefore, help improve early detection of contaminated meat and dairy products to mitigate outbreaks of food poisoning.",

Primer Explorer V4 (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan; http://primerexplorer.jp/elampn4.0.0/index.htmL) along with manual design were performed. The primers specificity was validated by BLASTN against the GenBank nucleotide database. The sequences of primers from Goto et al. 2 Table 2 ) used for LAMP product detection was manually designed, and checked for specificity by BLASTN against the GenBank nucleotide database. Gold nanoparticles of 20 nm in diameter (Sigma-Aldrich) were appended to the Probe-Sa_SEA following methods of Jaroenram et al. 23 and Somboonna et al. 22 . In brief, 50 \u00b5L of the Probe-Sa_SEA and 10 mL of gold nanoparticles were hybridized at 150 rpm at 50 \u00b0C in a hybridization oven (Thermo Scientific, New Jersey, USA), for 22 h. Next, 1 mL of 100 mM PBS, 10 \u00b5L of 10% SDS and 500 \u00b5L of 2 M NaCl, at 50 \u00b0C, were added, and the mixture was hybridized at 150 rpm at 50 \u00b0C for another 4 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The clear solution was removed, and the precipitate was resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (100 mM NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) SDS), and centrifuged again. The pellet was finally resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (100 mM NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) SDS) to give the gold nanoparticles-probe solution (AuNP) an absorbance of 0.3-0.4 at 525 nm, and was stored protected from light at 4 \u00b0C. To determine the optimal conditions for the colorimetric LAMP-AuNP reaction, mixtures with different volume ratios of LAMP:AuNP (1:9 to 9:1) (10 \u03bcL total volume) were incubated at 63 \u00b0C for 10 min, and 0.01-1 M MgSO 4 was then added. When a sufficient concentration of Mg 2+ was present in the absence of the LAMP product, the AuNP agglomerated and changed its color. However, the positive LAMP products hybridize with the AuNP via their specific complementary strands, and the agglomeration induced by the salt addition was inhibited 20, 22, 24 . The LAMP-AuNP results could be interpreted by naked eyes via their color: red/purple (positive) or clear/very light purple (negative), which could be further confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry. Controls included AuNP only, AuNP with MgSO 4 , and no template control (DNA was replaced by ddH 2 O). The AuNP only displayed the same color as the positive LAMP results, while the AuNP with salt and no template control with salt showed the same color as the negative LAMP results. All controls showed the expected colors for all tests (data not shown).",

This confirms the BLASTN results that our LAMP primer sequences were specific to only S. aureus sea (see Materials and Methods, details on the primer design requirement).

Next, we attempted to combine our LAMP with AuNP probe to allow visual color detection through the specific complementary binding between the LAMP product and our designed sea oligonucleotide probe (Supplemental Table 1 , Probe-Sa_SEA) attached to gold nanoparticles. The LAMP products corresponding to positive and negative samples were mixed with the AuNP probe at different ratios from 1:9 to 9:1 (vol./vol., total volume = 10 \u00b5L), and different amounts of salt (MgSO 4 ); and the appropriate condition was selected where a significant color difference between positive (red/purple) and negative (clear/very light purple) could be clearly observed by the naked eye within 1-2 min. The optimal condition was found to be 5:5 of LAMP:AuNP (vol./vol., 5 \u00b5L/5 \u00b5L) and 5 \u00b5L of 0.5 M MgSO 4 . Noted that other ratios also caused the color change, but at a slower rate (up to 10 min), for examples the 3:7 and 4:6 LAMP:AuNP (vol./vol) www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (Supplemental Fig. 2) . At a 1:9 ratio of LAMP:AuNP, the LAMP product was not present in sufficient amounts to inhibit the aggregation of the AuNP probe, while at too high amounts of the LAMP product (e.g. at 8:2 or 9:1), the color of the AuNP probe was difficult to observe. Hence, the ratio of 5:5 was most appropriate for the optimal detection since both positive and negative results could be judged relatively quickly within 1-2 min. The color difference as observed by the naked eye was confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry (wavelength scanning from 400 nm to 700 nm): positive peak at ~530 nm corresponded to red-purple color and negative results were observed as no peak (clear) or very minor peak (very light purple) (Supplemental Fig. 2 , at 5:5 LAMP-to-AuNP). The appropriate LAMP:AuNP condition was used to evaluate specificity and sensitivity. Fourteen bacterial strains, in Supplemental Table 1 , served as control for specificity evaluation, and our LAMP-AuNP correctly identified the positive and negative controls (Fig. 3A) . In term of sensitivity, the LAMP-AuNP results as determined by the naked eye were fully consistent with our LAMP results as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, showing a limit of detection as low as 9.7 fg, or equivalent to 3.2 sea copies (Figs. 1C and 3B) . The color visualization of the LAMP-AuNP product was also further confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry (Fig. 3C) 20,21,24 . Crude DNA lysis coupled LAMP-AuNP assay is hypersensitive and effective in real ground pork and milk sample tests. We evaluated the feasibility of using the assay for the point-of-care diagnostics by utilizing DNA samples obtained from simple crude DNA lysis instead of from DNA extraction kits as a template for the LAMP-AuNP assay. In the crude DNA lysis, we compared different lysis buffer (TE Buffer 34 , 0.25 N NaCl and 0.0125% SDS 38 , and 1% Triton X-100 36 ) from a minimum of three independent experiments and found that 1% Triton X-100 gave the highest DNA yield as determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The average yield of crude DNA extracted by TE buffer, 0.25 N NaCl and 0.0125% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100 was 1.34, 1.68 and 1.99 ng/\u00b5L, respectively. Therefore 1% Triton X-100 was used for the preparation of the crude DNA lysates. Live cultures of individual bacterial strains in Supplemental Table 1 were used to spike ground pork at 10 5 CFU/g and milk at 10 5 CFU/mL, and our crude DNA lysis coupled with LAMP-AuNP assay was evaluated for specificity in comparison to the culture method due to its wide use and acceptance as an ISO/IEC 17025 standard assay for S. aureus diagnostics in local settings in Thailand. Our method correctly identified positive and negative results for S. aureus sea, while the culture method showed positive results for all S. aureus sea and non-sea strains (Table 1) . For sensitivity evaluation, ground pork and milk with 10-10 5 CFU/g and CFU/mL of S. aureus (sea) were tested. The culture method could detect as low as 10 4 CFU/g whereas our assay could detect as low as 10 CFU/g of sea in ground pork samples. For milk samples, both the culture and our assays could detect as low as 10 CFU/mL www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (Table 2) . Here, food matrices affected the limit of detection to culture S. aureus. It should be noted that there were differences in the sample preparation for the two assays. To maintain the bacterial viability in culture, the sample preparation method for culture is simply a mixing step between ground pork and ddH 2 O to obtain a liquid suspension without the use of harsh reagents or heat, so that live S. aureus could remain in pork debris. On the other hand, the crude DNA lysate preparation for LAMP required a mild detergent (Triton X-100) and boiling.",

Small amounts of contamination may be present (e.g. <100 CFU), which could be a borderline case and can be acceptable under certain circumstances. However, a highly sensitive method that is qualitative in nature would simply indicate that such a sample is positive. Hence, there is a need for a method that allows quantitation of small amounts of DNA. In this context, we developed a new cationic fluorescent styryl dye (STR) (Fig. 4A ) that can brighten up in the presence of DNA. Such dyes can be used in combination with the developed LAMP method to detect and quantitate low levels of LAMP product. Several styryl dyes were screened (data not shown), and only the cationic benzothiazolium dye designated as STR (see synthesis details in Supplementary Information 39 ) Table 1 . Specificity comparison between the culture method by ISO/IEC 17025 laboratory and our crude DNA lysis coupled LAMP-AuNP on ground pork and milk samples spiked with live individual bacterial strains at 10 5 CFU per g of ground pork (or mL of milk). Results of the culture method were CFU/g (ground pork) or CFU/ mL (milk), and when the culture resulted <10 CFU the analysis was recorded as undetermined using \"+/\u2212\". Table 2 . Sensitivity comparison between the culture method by ISO/IEC 17025 laboratory (10-10 5 CFU per g of ground pork, or mL of milk) and our crude DNA lysis coupled LAMP-AuNP (1-10 5 CFU per g of ground pork, or mL of milk) using live S. aureus ATCC13565 culture spike. N/A represents data not available, because 1 CFU spiked-in experiment was not performed for the culture method.",

Moreover, a different level of color intensity was observed at different amounts of the DNA template, suggesting the possibilities of performing a semi-quantitative analysis. A minimum of 5 independent experiments each containing 0, 10, 100 and 1,000 CFU LAMP products were thus analyzed and the linear calibration plot between the fluorescent intensity (Y variable) and the log CFU (X variable) was obtained (Fig. 5A) . To confirm our derived quantitative equation, the live S. aureus (sea) culture (10, 100 and 1,000 CFU), the genomic DNA at the limit of detection of the LAMP-AuNP method (9.7 fg, or 3.2 copies), and the negative LAMP by the negative control strains or no template were evaluated. Our LAMP-STR was able to quantitate 10-1,000 CFU of S. aureus (sea), and for 3.2 copies LAMP the color intensity was found to be too small to be differentiated from the background density (Fig. 5B ).",

This increased the amount of LAMP product, so the assay time was reduced by half from 30 to 15 min compared to Goto et al. 's LAMP (and our LAMP without inner loop primers, data not shown). The limit of detection according to gel electrophoresis was also higher 20,23,24 (from 97 fg to 9.7 fg genome, or equivalent 3.2 sea copies). To enable point-of-care and resource-constrained diagnosis, AuNP functionalized with a probe complementary to the LAMP product was employed to replace the agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the specific LAMP products. This allows naked eye detection with high accuracy due to complementary binding between the target (in LAMP product) and the probe 41, 42 . Moreover, since the Bst DNA polymerase used in LAMP is much less sensitive to inhibitions than the Taq DNA polymerase typically employed in PCR, the sample preparation can be greatly simplified. The crude DNA lysis from real food samples, which often contain inhibitors to the culturing or the Taq DNA polymerase in PCR 17, 38, 43, 44 , was successfully employed. This study selected ground pork and milk as food samples, given that ground pork often had problems with the culture method, and both ground pork and milk required commercial DNA extraction kits for the PCR method. While the efficiency of the culture method was biased to sample types (poor limit of detection and assay accuracy for ground pork samples), our crude DNA lysis coupled with LAMP-AuNP showed a better limit of detection and a much higher assay accuracy for both ground pork and milk samples (10 CFU/g or mL, and 97.5-100% accuracy). Our assay accuracy was comparable to using commercial DNA extraction kit together with the PCR methods. Despite the fact that enterotoxin A accounts >50% of causes in some areas, the ability to detect every enterotoxin type gene that causes food poisoning is important. With appropriate primers and reaction conditions, our assay can be adapted for detecting and quantitating other enterotoxin type genes even with a minimal contamination.",
