As described in Chapter 3, \u201cFeatures of Host Cells: Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,\u201d the plasma membrane of the cell is composed of a phospholipid bilayer that has numerous proteins protruding from the membrane. These surface proteins have a variety of functions that include transporting ions and molecules, facilitating the binding of one cell to another, or acting as receptors for incoming proteins. The majority of plasma membrane proteins are glycosylated, meaning that they have been modified with sugars and carbohydrates. To infect a cell, it is critical that a virus initiates attachment\u2014the binding of the virus to the host cell. This interaction is specific: the virus contains a virus attachment protein that adsorbs to a cell surface receptor on the cell (Table 4.1\n). The target receptor molecules on the cell surface are normal molecules required for cellular functions that viruses have evolved to exploit, usually glycoproteins or the sugar/carbohydrate residues present on glycoproteins or the plasma membrane. For instance, rhinovirus binds a protein known as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), involved in the attachment of one cell to another. Influenza A virus strains bind to the sialic acid sugars found at the ends of cellular carbohydrate chains, and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) reversibly bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate, in order to bind to the herpesvirus entry mediator protein or nectins on the cell surface (Fig. 4.1\n).",

As will be described later in Chapter 11, \u201cHuman Immunodeficiency Virus,\u201d humans that have a modified version of CCR5, one of these coreceptors, are largely resistant to infection with HIV because the virus cannot use the modified CCR5 as a coreceptor and so infection is blocked.

The virus attachment protein is located in the outermost portion of the virus, since this is where contact with the cell occurs. The attachment protein protrudes from the envelope of an enveloped virus, whereas nonenveloped viruses have one or more capsid proteins that interact with the cell surface receptor. The viral attachment proteins can extend from the surface of the virion or can be within \u201ccanyons\u201d formed by capsid proteins. For example, 90% of human rhinovirus serotypes bind to ICAM-1 on the surface of cells. Instead of binding to the outside of the rhinovirus capsid, the molecule docks into a deep canyon formed by the rhinovirus VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins (Fig. 4.2A\n). In contrast, 10% of human rhinoviruses attach to the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor. This interaction does not occur in canyons formed by the viral proteins, however. Instead, several VP1 proteins at the vertices of the icosahedral capsid bind to the receptor (Fig. 4.2B). Even if the binding affinity between the VP1 protein and the VLDL receptor is low, the multiple VP1 proteins increase the total binding strength of the interaction. This example also illustrates that different strains of the same virus can take advantage of different cell surface receptors for attachment.",

            "text": "Receptor-mediated endocytosis is commonly used by viruses to penetrate the plasma membrane. As the pH of the endosome drops, the viral proteins change configuration, which allows them to escape from the endosome. Depending upon the virus, this can happen in early endosomes, late endosomes, or lysosomes. Both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses take advantage of receptor-mediated endocytosis to gain entry into the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 4.4). Most types of viruses use clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter the cell, including dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, and reoviruses. A few well-known viruses that infect humans, such as SV40 and papillomaviruses (that cause warts or cervical cancer), use caveolae-mediated endocytosis; this was discovered by using a drug that inhibited the formation of caveolae. Blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not prevent In-Depth Look: TropismDifferent cells perform different functions within a multicellular organism. As such, not all cells within the body display the same types of cell surface proteins. The tropism of a virus refers to the specificity of a virus for a particular host cell or tissue. Viruses will only be able to infect the cells that display the molecules to which their virus attachment proteins bind. Similarly, one reason that certain viruses have a narrow host range is because different host species may lack the cell surface proteins that a particular virus uses for attachment. For instance, humans are the only known natural hosts of poliovirus. Because of this, poliovirus has historically been a difficult virus to study because the cell surface receptor it uses for attachment, called CD155 or the poliovirus receptor, is not present in small animal models, such as mice. In 1990, a transgenic mouse strain was engineered to express the human CD155 molecule. These mice were susceptible to infection, whereas the normal nontransgenic mice were not (Fig. 4.3\n).the entry of these viruses into cells. Still other viruses undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis that is independent of both clathrin and caveolin.",

For instance, HIV has a protein known as gp120 that binds to CD4 and one of the two coreceptors for entry, CCR5 or CXCR4.

            "text": "\nUncoating refers to the breakdown or removal of the capsid, causing the release of the virus genome into the cell to wherever genome replication and transcription will take place. Uncoating can be separated from or tightly linked with penetration, and viruses achieve uncoating in a variety of different ways (Fig. 4.5\n). For example, rhinoviruses are taken into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated vesicles. Within the acidic endosome, the virus expands in size about 4%, and one of the capsid proteins, VP1 (viral protein 1), forms pores in the endosome that allow the release of the rhinovirus RNA genome. On the other hand, influenza virus has a viral protein known as hemagglutinin (HA) embedded into the virus envelope. HA binds to sialic acid residues found on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells, and penetration occurs through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The low pH of the endosome causes a conformational change in the viral HA protein, revealing a fusion peptide that brings the two membranes close together and fuses the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. In this case, the HA protein facilitates both attachment and uncoating of the virus. The released viral RNA genome segments are transported to the nucleus and enter through nuclear pores. Other viral capsids, such as those of poliovirus, have been thought to not enter the cell at all: the binding of the poliovirus capsid to the cell surface receptor causes a conformational change in the virion that creates a pore in the cell membrane through which the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. In contrast, many viruses remain largely intact after penetration. Reoviruses do not completely uncoat within the cytoplasm, providing a \u201chome base\u201d for genome replication.",

Eukaryotic DNA replication, also reviewed in more detail in Chapter 3, \u201cFeatures of Host Cells: Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,\u201d is also carried out by DNA polymerases and other proteins within the nucleus. DNA polymerases, whether they are cell derived or virus derived, cannot carry out de novo synthesis, however. They must bind to a short primer of nucleic acid that has bound to the single-stranded piece of DNA, forming a short double-stranded portion that is then extended by DNA polymerase (Fig. 4.8A\n). Primase is the enzyme that creates primers during cellular DNA replication, and some viruses, such as polyomaviruses and some herpesviruses, take advantage of the cellular primase enzyme to create primers on their dsDNA genomes during replication. Other herpesviruses, such as HSV-1, provide their own primase molecule, although this process occurs less commonly. Still other viruses, such as the adenoviruses, encode a viral protein primer that primes its own viral DNA polymerase (Fig. 4.8B). Cellular DNA polymerases are used by polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, while all other dsDNA viruses encode their own DNA polymerases to replicate the viral genome. Many other cellular enzymes and proteins are required for DNA synthesis, and viruses are dependent on these to varying degrees, depending upon the specific virus.

Cellular mRNA is transcribed by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase called RNA polymerase II. As the name suggests, a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase requires a DNA template to make RNA, so it cannot transcribe mRNA from an RNA genome. Therefore, cells do not contain the enzymes necessary to transcribe mRNA from an RNA template, and so all RNA viruses must carry or encode their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to transcribe viral mRNA (Fig. 4.10A\n). dsRNA viruses contain an RdRp that is carried into the cell within the virion.",

Initiation of reverse transcription requires a primer, which is provided by one of around 100 tRNAs (most of which are specific for lysine or proline) that the virus obtained from the previous host cell. The tRNA partially unwinds and complementary base pairs to 18 nucleotides within the primer-binding site (PBS), located toward the 5\u2032-end of the viral RNA (Fig. 4.12\n). RT binds to the primer and extends its sequence, adding DNA nucleotides complementary to the viral RNA, until it reaches the end. This forms what is referred to as the negative-strand strong-stop DNA, because the RT has extended the negative strand and it stops when it reaches the end of the RNA template. The U5 and R sequences are copied in this segment. The RNase H activity of RT degrades the RNA from the RNA\u2013DNA hybrid, leaving the ssDNA U5 and R sequences. Because the R sequence in the DNA is complementary to the R sequence found on the 3\u2032-end of the viral RNA, the two R sequences bind and the RT is able to continue extending the negative strand until the end, where the PBS sequence is found. After being reverse transcribed, the viral RNA is degraded by the RNase H activity of the enzyme, although a small portion resists being digested. This polypurine tract (PPT) is composed of purine nucleotides, namely adenine and guanine, and it acts as a primer for RT to begin reverse transcribing the DNA positive strand.

(You will recall that these 18 nucleotides of the tRNA initially unwound and bound to the PBS. By copying this segment of the tRNA, another PBS sequence has been created.)

Reverse transcriptase possesses the activity of three different enzymes in one: an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, and RNase H, which degrades the RNA from an RNA:DNA duplex.The enzyme has been of much utility in molecular biology since its discovery. It was first isolated from viruses but now is produced by bacteria that have been engineered to express the gene. In the laboratory, RT allows for the production of cDNAs from mRNAs. Because cDNA is more stable and easier to manipulate than mRNA, this discovery has been vital in the characterization of gene expression and the study of mRNAs (Fig. 4.14\n).\n",

Up to this point, the virion had been in the process of forming, and if the cell were broken open at this point, the virions would not be able to initiate infection of new cells. Maturation refers to the final changes within an immature virion that result in an infectious virus particle. Structural capsid changes are often involved, and these can be mediated by host enzymes or virus-encoded enzymes. A good example involves the influenza HA protein. It is involved in attachment to the cell\u2019s sialic acid, as described above, and the HA protein is able to bind sialic acid after being glycosylated (via posttranslational modification). However, the HA protein must be cleaved into two portions, HA1 and HA2, to become infectious, because although the HA1 portion binds the cell surface receptor, the HA2 portion is what fuses the viral envelope to the endosomal membrane to release the virus into the cytoplasm. This cleavage of HA into HA1 and HA2 is carried out by cell proteases (enzymes that cleave proteins). In contrast, the HIV core particle is composed of proteins encoded by the gag gene. The gene is translated into a polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease to form the capsid, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins of the virion. In this case, maturation occurs after the virion has been released from the cell surface (Fig. 4.17\n) and is required to form an infectious virion. Discussed in\nChapter 8, \u201cVaccines, Antivirals, and the Beneficial Uses of Viruses,\u201d several anti-HIV drugs work by inhibiting the action of the HIV protease, thereby preventing the cleavage of the polyprotein and subsequent formation of an infectious virion.",

            "text": "\nSection 4.4 Replication\u2022There are seven classes of viruses in the Baltimore classification system, which is based upon the type of nucleic acid and replication strategy of viruses: dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, +ssRNA, \u2212ssRNA, RNA viruses that reverse transcribe, and DNA viruses that reverse transcribe.\u2022All human dsDNA viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, must gain entry into the nucleus for replication because of the DNA or RNA polymerases that are present there. dsDNA viruses often transcribe their gene products in waves in order to ensure an ordered process that does not put too much overall stress upon the cell. Herpesviruses, poxviruses, and adenoviruses are examples of dsDNA viruses that infect humans.\u2022The genome of ssDNA viruses is converted into dsDNA by the host cell DNA polymerase after self-priming. At this point, the replication of DNA and transcription of mRNA are carried out in the same way as dsDNA viruses. Anelloviruses and parvoviruses are examples of human ssDNA viruses.\u2022Human dsRNA viruses, namely reoviruses and picobirnaviruses, are nonenveloped and icosahedral with segmented genomes. To transcribe their genome into vmRNA, they must carry their own RdRp, since the cell does not contain an enzyme that will transcribe mRNA from an RNA template.\u2022The genomes of +ssRNA viruses are infectious, since positive-sense RNA is able to be directly translated by ribosomes. Consequently, +ssRNA viruses do not carry an RdRp protein but instead encode it so it is immediately translated by ribosomes into the RdRp protein. +ssRNA viruses encode a single polyprotein that is cleaved into several different individual proteins. Seven different families of +ssRNA viruses infect humans and include poliovirus, rhinovirus, Norwalk virus, hepatitis C virus, and rubella virus, among many others.\u2022\u2212ssRNA viruses are not infectious and must be transcribed into vmRNA before translation can occur. Therefore, \u2212ssRNA viruses must also carry an RdRp into the cell. \u2212ssRNA viruses have helical ribonucleoprotein complexes that are composed of the viral RNA, the protecting capsid protein, and any associated enzymes. As with +ssRNA viruses, an antigenome is transcribed and acts as a template to create the genome. Ambisense viruses are partially positive sense and partially negative sense. Several well-known human viruses have \u2212ssRNA genomes, including influenza viruses, Ebola virus, rabies virus, measles virus, and mumps virus.\u2022Due to the lack of proofreading ability, RNA polymerases have lower fidelity than DNA polymerases.\u2022New strains of virus can occur when two different strains infect one cell. Recombination occurs when the genome of an RNA virus is being replicated and the RdRp jumps from the template of one strain to the template of the other strain, creating a hybrid genome. Reassortment occurs when the genome segments of segmented viruses are mixed while being packaged into new capsids.\u2022Retroviruses are viruses that reverse transcribe an RNA genome into cDNA. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme that carries this out and has the activity of an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, and RNase H. HIV, a human retrovirus, becomes a provirus when its IN protein merges the viral cDNA into the host\u2019s chromosomal DNA. Transcription and genome replication is carried out by host enzymes.\n\u2022Hepatitis B virus is also a retroid virus but instead reverse transcribes in order to create its DNA genome, which is partially single-stranded and partially double-stranded and known as rcDNA. This is repaired to a completely double-stranded episome (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the cell. RNA polymerase II transcribes an RNA pregenome that is reverse transcribed, after being packaged into the capsid, into the rcDNA genome.\n",
