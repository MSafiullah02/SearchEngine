Four main types of ILD have been reported in patients with polymyositis\u2013dermatomyositis: type (I): acute presentation where fever, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates appear in less than 2 weeks; type (II): insidious disease with dyspnea, cough and pulmonary infiltrate; type (III): asymptomatic pulmonary infiltrates without respiratory symptoms; type (IV): normal HRCT and chest X-ray findings with abnormal respiratory function tests [10]. For the first case, acute ILD (type I) with symptoms of dyspnea, fever and respiratory failure appeared after 2\u20133 weeks of the disease.

However, hepatic involvement had not been reported in patients with JDM, other than mild elevation of hepatic enzymes. Matsumato et al. [15] reported different types of liver involvement in 18 adult patients with dermatomyositis\u2013polymyositis: fatty liver (66.7%), hepatic congestion (50%), nonspecific reactive hepatitis (11%) and primary biliary chirosis (5\u20136%). They concluded that fatty change seen in more than 50% of patients with collagen tissue disease may be due to steroid treatments. Hepatic biopsy of the second patient revealed nonspecific reactive hepatitis and fatty liver changes prior to steroid treatment. We thought that the co-existence of hepatic and pulmonary involvement might have caused the unfavorable outcome in the second case.",
