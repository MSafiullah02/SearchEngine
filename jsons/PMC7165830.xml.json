This has also been demonstrated in other cell lines with similar antigen presentation\u2010deficient phenotypes, such as the murine NSCLC cell line CMT.64, human MAA, human small cell lung carcinoma, human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and human renal cell carcinomas.20, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 In B16F10 cells, TAP1 expression stabilized the expression of TAP2 and increased the expression of endogenous tapasin. This indicates that the re\u2010expression of TAP1 may lead to a general reconstitution of several other components of the MHC Class I antigen\u2010processing pathway, and may therefore increase the amount of antigenic peptide available for assembly onto MHC Class I molecules in the ER. Restoration of TAP expression in TAP\u2010deficient cancer cells should make a wide variety of peptides derived from tumor\u2010specific and \u2010associated antigens available and perhaps this may compensate for any unpredictable deficiencies in the cell's MHC Class I antigen allele repertoire.",

B16/rTAP1 cells present H\u20102Db antigen\u2010specific peptides derived from gp100, making B16/rTAP1 cells susceptible to specific CTL lysis both in vitro and in vivo\n30. Vaccination by irradiated cells expressing TAP1 enhances greatly the CTL activity not only towards B16/rTAP1 target cells but also to untransfected B16F10 target cells. This indicates that it is likely not necessary for every cell to re\u2010express TAP1 for immune tolerance to the tumor to be broken, allowing CD8+ cytotoxic T\u2010cell responses to occur. This is further supported by our previous in vivo study with CMT.64 lung carcinoma, in which mice initially immunized with CMT.64 expressing TAP1 were better able to reject a challenge with untransfected CMT.64, unlike mice initially immunized with untransfected CMT.64.22 Perhaps encouraging for applications to metastatic disease, the lysis of B16F10 cells by splenocytes generated by vaccination with irradiated B16/rTAP1 cells demonstrates that there is sufficient H\u20102 antigen on the surface of B16F10 cells to facilitate cytolytic activity. TAP1 activity or the products of TAP1 activity in B16/rTAP1 cells must be transferred in some way to the dendritic cells involved in the cross\u2010presentation of MHC Class I tumor antigens, a crucial step in generating specific CD8+ cytotoxic T\u2010cell responses. TAP1 expression in B16/rTAP1 cells results in a source of antigen that may be bound to MHC Class I antigens on the surface of B16/rTAP1 cells and these MHC Class I antigen\u2010restrictedantigens are transferred to the dendritic cell MHC Class I antigens. Alternatively, dendritic cells may access processed tumor antigens from the ER compartment of B16/rTAP1 cells during internalization and antigen cross\u2010presentation.",

Vaccination of mice with MAA antigens specific for H\u20102Db antigen are protected from B16/rTAP1 tumor challenge but not by challenge with B16F10 cells by CD8+ T\u2010cells.30 In our study, B16/rTAP1 tumor growth was retarded without prior vaccination with tumor differentiation antigens, though the protection was not as complete as with prior vaccination. The effect also appears when TAP1 is transferred in vivo by vaccinia expression vectors. In this case, not only does TAP1 expression have an effect on tumor growth, but also the vector provides an adjuvant effect. In addition, we found that in vitro infection of B16F10 cells transfected with TAP1 (B16/ r TAP1 3\u20138 cells) with VV\u2010rTAP1 did not greatly enhance H\u20102Kb and H\u20102Db antigen surface expression relative to VV\u2010PJS\u20105 infected cells. This may indicate that TAP activity is already at a maximum as a result of transfection, and that additional expression of TAP1 from the VV construct does not further upregulate MHC Class I antigen expression to a great extent. We propose that in addition to tumor antigens, upon infection the tumor cells also present viral antigens in the presence of TAP that provide further epitopes for CTL recognition. The presence of the VV during the processing tumor antigens by DCs may also assist in breaking the tolerance of the immune system towards the tumor cells by acting as a \u201cdanger signal\u201d that contributes to the priming of tumor antigen\u2010specific immune responses.31, 32 Furthermore, B16F10 tumors are known to harbor regulatory T\u2010cells that secrete cytokines, such as IL\u201010, which energize CD8+ T\u2010cells in tumors.33 TAP1 gene transfer by vaccinia vectors reduced the number of CD3+/IL\u201010 secreting lymphocytes in the tumors, one of the modulating factors that have been implicated in the resistance of MAAs to antitumor immune responses. TAP1 expression, in conjunction with viral gene transfer vector, promotes a Th1 type response that can function to retard tumor growth. Thus, immunotherapeutic approaches that utilize TAP have the potential to restore the priming and expansion of specific T\u2010cells and the subsequent ability of the tumors to process and present tumor antigens.",
