            "text": "There is an increasing appreciation for the role of mechanical force in biological processes at the cellular and molecular scale both in vitro and in vivo.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 A striking example that makes it easy to appreciate the role of mechanical force at the molecular level is the translation elongational cycle of the ribosome during protein synthesis, one of life's most fundamental processes. With peptidyl transfer RNA (tRNA) holding on to the growing peptide while residing in the ribosome's P site, aminoacyl transfer RNAs carrying amino acids in accordance with the codon sequence of messenger RNA enter and form a codon\u2013anticodon pair in the aminoacyl or A site of the ribosome (accommodation). After a new peptide bond has formed, the P-site and A-site tRNA's are moved to the E (Exit) site and P site (translocation), respectively, threading paired mRNA through the ribosome. Translocation vacates the A site, allowing new tRNA to enter and bind (Fig. 1\n). The cycle repeats typically until a stop codon on the mRNA is reached. Since ribosomes can translate only single-stranded mRNA, complex mRNA structure motifs are unwound, by a mechanism that still remains obscure. Unlike initiation of translation for which several helicases have been identified6 (eIF4A, DHX29, Ded1/DDX3, RHA/DHX9 to name a few), or where ribosomal protein S1 may be involved to unwind the mRNA7 there are no known RNA helicases associated with the translocation of ribosomes along mRNA as part of the elongational cycle. How then do translocating ribosomes unwind the downstream mRNA structure they encounter? Work by Takyar et al. suggests that prokaryotic ribosomes have helicase activity themselves conferred on them by ribosomal proteins S3, S4, and S5, which encircle the mRNA entering the ribosome.8 None of these proteins, however, have any ATPase activity that is usually associated with DNA and/or RNA helicases.9 However, given the location of the helicase activity inside the mRNA tunnel, rotation of the 30S head relative to the 50S body could serve to shear the mRNA apart.10, 11 It is also in principle conceivable that ribosomes may simply be strong enough, building up sufficient tension when translocating the tRNA and associated mRNA, to unfold any downstream mRNA as it forces it into the narrow mRNA entrance tunnel. However, prokaryotic ribosomes stall out at a relatively low opposing force of approximately 13 pN (for comparison, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase can move against forces up to \u223c24 pN12), which seems to rule out any brute-force mechanisms for mRNA unfolding.13 A recent single-molecule experiment indicates that ribosome helicase action during the translational elongation cycle may be twofold: it destabilizes the helical junction at the mRNA entry site favoring an open conformation, and it appears to pull mRNA strands apart during the translocation step when relatively large structural rearrangements occur on the ribosome.14 Mechanical force may in principle assist in either activity.",

            "text": "When ribosomes translocate, tRNA and mRNA tension may build up in the single-stranded mRNA connecting the coding site (A and P sites) and any downstream mRNA structure not yet unwound that is being pulled against the mRNA entry tunnel. In response to such increased tension ribosomes may pause or stall; they may unwind the downstream structure; the codon\u2013anticodon interactions at the A and P sites may be disrupted; or a combination of these events may occur. Such a prominent role of mechanical force has appeal for quantitative physical modeling of \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF). \u22121 PRF is a translational recoding event in which ribosomes slip backward, out of the reading frame by a single base in response to two cis-acting mRNA elements, a so-called slippery sequence at the ribosome coding site, and a downstream mRNA structure motif (pseudoknot, hairpin) at the entrance to the ribosome (Fig. 2\n).16, 17, 18 Failure to unwind such a structure increases tension lowering the kinetic barrier for disruption of the codon\u2013anticodon pairs at the slippery site.19, 20, 21 The subsequent mRNA backward slippage, by a single nucleotide, is thought to relieve the tension so that the codon\u2013anticodon interaction is reestablished but now in a \u22121 shifted reading frame. \u22121 PRF expands the information capacity of mRNA and is essential for the replication of (retro)viruses with minimal, compact genomes (eg, HIV-1, SARS). In many such systems, \u22121 PRF induces skipping of the 0-frame stop codon, giving rise to a fusion of structural and enzymatic proteins (to be further edited posttranslationally). In a mechanical picture of \u22121 PRF, the probability of a frameshift, also known as the frameshift efficiency is determined by the stability of the codon\u2013anticodon interaction at the slippery sequence,22 the structural integrity of the downstream mRNA structure,23 and the elastic properties of the spacer bridging both those elements.",

Goldman et al., recently demonstrated that mechanical force rescues stalled translation as part of the Sec protein-translocation pathway.25 This pathway arrests translation as ribosome-nascent peptide chains are targeted to the membrane, that is, to the SecYEG transport channel.26 Subsequently, the ATPase SecA is thought to physically pull on the nascent peptide restarting translation elongation and driving the peptide though the channel. An elegant single-molecule experiment by Goldman et al. demonstrated that pulling on the peptide with a mechanical force applied by optical tweezers indeed proved sufficient to restart translation elongation in arrested ribosomes.25\n",

In most implementations of optical tweezers, k\nx and k\ny are similar if not identical, whereas k\nz is approximately 3\u20135 times smaller.47 A variety of methods, generally based upon the Brownian motion of the particle in a harmonic potential and/or upon the response of the particle due to a known (fluid dynamic) disturbance, have been developed to calibrate these spring constants with ever increasing precision and accuracy.47, 49 Once the spring constants have been determined, forces are computed from the measured displacement of the particle from the center of the tweezers. Optical tweezers have been shown to be ideally suited for exerting and measuring forces in the pN (10\u201312 N) regime. For large displacements the linear force\u2013distance relation is lost and the tweezers is no longer spring-like. In fact a small region of constant force is encountered, which has been taken advantage of for creating a so-called passive constant-force trap.50 Optical tweezers are not capable of trapping the molecules directly, but rather trap silica or polystyrene microspheres ranging in size from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers that have been attached to the molecule of interest. To stretch and unfold individual molecules, the structural element of interest (RNA, DNA, protein) usually is sandwiched between two DNA handles that are then attached to the microsphere(s) held with the optical tweezers (Fig. 3\n).51, 52 Commonly used geometries include a single-beam setup with one handle attached to a solid surface, such as a microscope cover glass, while the other handle is held with the optical tweezers. The molecule may subsequently be stretched by laterally or vertically moving the microscope cover glass using a piezo-driven microscope stage. As indicated in Fig. 3A, due to the specific geometry of this assay, upon lateral movement of the microscope stage the microsphere is pulled and displaced not only laterally but also axially, demanding knowledge of k\nx, and k\nz as well as measurement of the displacements \u0394x and \u0394z to compute the direction and magnitude of the force exerted in the direction along the molecule.53 While initially in these assays the measurement of \u0394z proved problematic and k\nz and \u0394z were estimated or computed indirectly,53 it was later realized that the so-called back-focal plane position detection54, 55 provides a direct measurement of \u0394x, \u0394y, as well as of \u0394z with the latter being proportional to the total light intensity impinging on the photosensitive sensor.56 Recent technological advances have taken advantage of this development and produced ultrastable (low drift) and extremely high precision and resolution optical tweezers specifically for use with the surface-attachment geometry.57, 58\n",

This geometry in principle holds significant practical advantages over the other geometries. Instrumental drift is much reduced as the molecule, handles, and beads are suspended in a fluid and do not have any direct mechanical interaction, that is, contact with the instrument. Remaining drift due to laser beam pointing instabilities may be further reduced by traditional-type laser beam stabilization techniques utilizing feedback schemes and/or immersing essential optical paths in helium.60 Such measures allow for subnanometer, Angstrom level resolution position measurements of trapped particles. In addition, when the positions of the microspheres in both traps are measured simultaneously, correlation analysis may provide further enhancement of the position signal to noise ratio.61 While in principle not limited to this geometry, the dumbbell assay saw the first implementation of the so-called passive constant-force tweezers or force clamp.50 Constant-force optical tweezers were pioneered to study the force dependence of the mechanochemistry of the kinesin motor protein.37, 48 This force clamp applied a (digital) feedback to assure a constant distance between the center of the tweezers and the microsphere, thus maintaining a constant force. It has been shown however that the limited time-response of the feedback loop may directly affect the kinetics of unfolding and refolding of molecules held near the transition force.62 A passive force clamp eliminates the need for any active feedback by pulling one of the microspheres in the dumbbell assay to a region of the optical tweezers where the potential is linear and thus the force is constant.50 This region typically is small, \u223c50 nm, limiting its use to the unfolding of small molecules only. Recently by shaping the trapped particles Phillips et al. were able to increase the constant-force region to several microns.63 It remains to be seen if the relatively large particles for which this was demonstrated prove practical and advantageous for single-molecule unfolding studies, but the idea is interesting as it could allow access to the unfolding of much larger molecules.",

The typical magnetic field gradient however is sufficiently shallow so that magnetic tweezers are by their nature a constant-force single-molecule technique. The force applied remains constant over the dimensions of the molecule, that is, independent of its state, folded or unfolded. As the force is applied vertically, the particle's displacement upon unfolding is usually determined with nanometer resolution from the degree of defocus observed in the microscope using image processing. The axial spring constant, k\nz is readily determined from lateral particle displacement fluctuations (Brownian motion) once realizing the system entails an inverted pendulum.30 It is of interest that axial, vertical stretching is now also used on occasion with optical tweezers enabling the use of short tethers.67\n",

Such parallelization, although in principle not impossible with optical tweezers is more readily achieved using magnetic tweezers in which the magnetic field is applied over a large area that in principle could contain tens to hundreds of surface-tethered particles.

            "text": "AFM has traditionally been applied for force spectroscopy of individual proteins or protein repeats, in particular the giant protein titin (Fig. 4B).33 In AFM a cantilevered sharp tip probes the surface which the molecule of interest has been deposited on and/or attached to. As it moves along the surface, the tip approaches and retracts from the surface, detecting a tip-molecule attachment as the cantilever deflects upon retraction. This bending of the cantilever is determined by measuring the deflection of a laser beam reflected off the end of the cantilever using a position-sensitive photo detector. The spring constant of the cantilever is generally determined by analysis of its thermal fluctuations, in much the same way as the optical tweezers use Brownian motion. Other methods exist, for a review see Cumpson et al.70 While typical cantilevers have spring constants far exceeding those of optical tweezers resulting in typical forces of order nN, softer cantilevers have become available allowing forces in the pN regime to be measured or applied. Furthermore, recent technical improvements reducing drift and increasing tip-sample stability to as small as 100 pm have the potential of bringing AFM to single-molecule unfolding experiments that would otherwise employ optical tweezers.71 Also note that such stability in principle makes previously impossible constant-force experiments feasible. AFM would then hold the advantage that it is more readily automated to scan the surface for viable candidates for stretching; unfold and refold the molecule a predetermined number of times; then break the tether and move on to the next. Since typically the tip-molecule attachment is nonspecific it is not always clear which part of the molecule is unfolded, or worse if the molecule or something else altogether has been stretched. One therefore tends to construct repeat sequences of the structures of interest which serve as a fingerprint of the molecule.72 For example, in a five-repeat structure one may decide to only analyze data displaying three or more repeats, thus maximizing the probability that the desired molecule is being unfolded. However, since it was shown that unfolding forces depend upon the number of unfolded domains in a chain, so-called order statistics need to be applied for generating proper parent distribution functions73 of unfolding forces before such data can further be utilized for analysis and/or predictions of kinetic behavior. While this analysis assumes repeats of identical noninteracting domains governed by a single underlying parent force distribution function, in principle the same applies when unfolding sequences of nonidentical structural domains, such as complex molecules74 in which case the unfolding forces are pulled from multiple differing parent distributions. Successful statistical order correction may then depend on the ability to recognize which type of domain is unfolded (eg, by difference in change of extension) so as to assign the observed unfolding event to the proper associated parent distribution.",

Unfolding of structures initially too big to pass through and blocking the current may be detected as a sudden increase in the current after they unfold and then zip through the pore. By ramping up the potential difference across the pore, a distribution of unfolding voltages can thus be acquired. Alternatively, one may choose to operate at constant voltage and record the time required for unfolding to occur. In many respects this is analogous to the use of optical tweezers with voltage taking the role of force. However, while nanopore-based experiments sample only a single unfolding event for each of the many molecules passing through sequentially, optical tweezers experiments do the opposite and are better suited to sample many repeated unfolding and refolding events for only one single molecule. Also, unlike optical tweezers the magnitude of the actual force applied remains largely unknown. Efforts have been made to measure this force directly using optical tweezers and nanopores in a combined setup (Fig. 3B).81 Interestingly, in such an arrangement one could imagine using the optical tweezers to pull a molecule through the nanopore (in the absence of any electrical potential) potentially mimicking how ribosomes pull through and unravel structured mRNA. Although such type of experiments have been proposed81, 82 actual data remains scarce, if nonexistent.

As the construct is stretched the force increases accordingly and is determined by measuring the position of the microsphere in the optical trap or magnetic tweezers, or the deflection of the AFM tip. When the force ramp is shallow and the molecule is pulled slowly, that is, slower than the intrinsic kinetic (un)folding rates of the molecule, the (un)folding event occurs at or very near to thermodynamic equilibrium. Equilibrium behavior is readily recognized in recorded force-extension data: the sudden increase in extension upon unfolding during stretching occurs at the same force as the drop in extension upon relaxation of the molecule.51 In other words, the extension and relaxation curves overlap. At equilibrium conditions, equilibrium thermodynamic quantities such as the free-energy change of the reaction (\u0394G) are readily derived once the elastic response of the DNA handles has been accounted for.51, 84, 85 However, equilibrium conditions cannot always be met and are often limited to a relatively small group of molecules, such as short DNA and RNA stem loops that lack tertiary interaction and when structural properties are predominantly governed by Watson\u2013Crick base pairing. Nevertheless, even with these molecules, experiments can quickly be driven away from equilibrium by stretching (and relaxing) the molecule more rapidly. In particular, tertiary interactions quickly drive experiments away from equilibrium so that unfolding and refolding forces differ significantly, even at moderate to low ramp rates (an example is shown in Fig. 6). In many cases equilibrium conditions simply prove impractical experimentally as low ramp rates put ever-increasing demands upon instrument stability and drift.",

However, given the large number of degrees of freedom of even the smallest RNA molecules, these energy landscapes are highly multidimensional allowing, in principle, multiple pathways from an unfolded to the lowest-energy folded conformation. Experiments usually only resolve a 1D projection of the multidimensional landscape onto a single reaction coordinate (Fig. 5\n). For example, in the case of mechanical unfolding the end-to-end distance or extension of the molecule appears a natural choice for a reaction coordinate. However, can such a condensed 1D projection capture the relevant thermodynamics and kinetics of the systems studied? In other words, what makes a \u201cgood\u201d reaction coordinate? This is an important question as a poor choice of reaction coordinate may quickly lead to incorrect interpretation of data and to wrong conclusions.90, 92 Recent work has started to address this question more rigorously. One may demand that a \u201cgood\u201d reaction coordinate faithfully captures the folding kinetics observed in data and provides predictions on the outcome of a pathway. But since the choice of reaction coordinate is typically not free but experimentally constrained, how can one test and confirm that the experimentally accessible reaction coordinate is in fact a \u201cgood\u201d coordinate. Work by Du et al. introduces the split probability or committer, p\nF(x), as a reaction coordinate quality test.93\n",

Ideally, p\nF(x) should approach 0 when in the unfolded state, 1 in the folded state, and a \u00bd when at the top of the barrier separating the two energy minima, the latter condition then a reasonable minimum requirement for a \u201cgood\u201d reaction coordinate. Upon such analysis by Chodera et al. the end-to-end distance appeared at first a poor reaction coordinate for unfolding DNA hairpins using optical tweezers.94 However, subsequent work by Neupane et al., who carefully accounted for any effects of the extra fluctuations due to compliance of DNA handles and microspheres in the optical tweezers, did find the end-to-end distance to be a good reaction coordinate.95 Rather than p\nF(x) however, they evaluated a related, perhaps more robust quantity, the conditional probability p(x|TP) that the molecule is on a transition path when the end-to-end distance equals x, a function that sharply peaks near the top of the barrier where it should approach \u00bd. One concludes that (un)folding of simple DNA hairpins near equilibrium can be considered a 1D diffusion problem.95 While this analysis proved successful for relatively simple molecular structures, it remains to be seen if the same conclusion will hold for more complex architectures containing tertiary interactions prevalent in proteins and many RNA molecules.74, 96 In any case, the analysis framework for testing reaction coordinate quality should be directly applicable to such systems. It may be fair to demand that single-molecule unfolding studies include a reaction coordinate quality test if any energy landscape and/or kinetics are to be derived from single-molecule unfolding data.",

When during translation, ribosomes move along and unwind the double-stranded hairpin, upon each translated codon six nucleotides become exposed yielding a readily detectable stepwise increase in extension of the trapped DNA\u2013RNA construct. Downstream of the frameshift signal the mRNA contains two spatially well-separated stop codons positioned in the 0 frame and \u22121 frame, respectively, which serve as frameshift reporters (Fig. 8). Once a ribosome has stalled at one of the stop codons, a long (\u223c40 bp) or short (\u223c26 bp) hairpin remains depending upon the reading frame. The size of the remaining hairpin is readily determined by unfolding using the optical tweezers in force-ramp mode and careful analysis of the increase in extension. The frameshift signal investigated was derived from the E. coli DnaX gene and contains three essential RNA elements: a slippery sequence (AAAAAAC) and a downstream RNA structure (a 11 base pair hairpin), two elements also commonly required in viral \u22121 PRF signals, and in addition a Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence 10 nucleotides upstream of the slippery sequence. In the assay the DnaX hairpin has been extended to contain the frameshift reporters, that is, the two stop codons and hairpin structure.",
