The mixed sample was used to detect inter-chain NOEs from 1 H-15 N to 1 H-13 C. In the bottom, the expected diagonal and cross-peaks in each experiment are schematically illustrated, with positive and negative peaks in black and red, respectively. b, NOESY strips showing examples of the unambiguous inter-chain NOEs of the TMD-CT LLP2 , identified using the above strategy. The control sample was used to acquire a 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC spectrum, while the mixed sample was used to record an identical 15 N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC spectrum as well as the 3D JCH-modulated NOE spectrum. A mixing time of 200 ms was employed in all the experiments. Comparison of the strips from the 15 N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC spectra of the control and mixed samples allowed the identification of inter-chain NOEs. The identified NOEs were then unambiguously validated by recording the JCH-modulated NOE spectrum, in which two interleaved spectra were acquired with varying the JCH evolution (JCH = 0 ms and JCH = 8 ms) before the NOE mixing. The subtraction of the two spectra allowed selection of only the inter-protomer NOEs. Positive and negative peaks are shown in black and red, respectively. The inter-protomer NOEs shown are: 1 H N V689 to 1 between the TMD-CT LLP2 and TMD constructs allowed to calibrate the PREamp values of the TMD-CT LLP2 against the previously established structure and membrane partition of the TMD 3, 4 such that the PREamp values can directly translate to plane restraints for the CT region of the TMD-CT LLP2 . f, Assignment of plane restraints for residues 711-788 of the TMD-CT LLP2 using data from Gd-DOTA (top) and 16-DSA (bottom) titrations. First, the PREamp vs. residue number of the TMD-CT LLP2 was converted to PREamp vs. rZ using the known TMD trimer structure (PDB ID: 5JYN). The PREamp vs. rZ profiles were then fitted to the sigmoidal function (Eq. 2) (left). Second, the best-fit curves (red) were used to assign rZ for residues 711-788 (middle). Only rZ in the PREsensitive regions of the curves were retained (white area). Finally, the calculated rZ from Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA curves were averaged, merged into one single data set and used as plane restraints for the TMD-CT LLP2 structure calculation. Once the structure was obtained, the correlation between experimental PREamp and those predicted from the new structure was determined. For both Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA data sets, the agreement is good as high Pearson linear correlation coefficient (R) were obtained (note: R is smaller for 16-DSA than for Gd-DOTA because the magnitude of PREamp variation is smaller for the former (~0.8 -1.0) than for the latter (~0.6 -1.0)). In addition, the membrane partition of the TMD-CT LLP2 trimer was derived by fitting the PREamp vs. rZ profile (generated this time using the new atomic coordinates) to Eq. 2 and found to be virtually identical to that of the TMD, validating the use of the latter as internal calibration. In all plots, error bars represent the uncertainty derived from fitting error. g, Same as (f) but for the MPER-TMD-CT LLP2 . In this case, only the Gd-DOTA data were used.

The strongest inter-chain NOEs are highlighted in the green box (residues 689-696). The different peak intensities are due to the different size and relaxation properties of the three constructs.

For residues 679-710, the NOE restraints were taken from our earlier NMR study of the TMD 3 . c For residues 711-788, plane restraints were derived using PREamp values obtained in the current study. For residues 679-710, plane restraints were directly taken from our earlier NMR study of the TMD (internal calibration) 4 . d Backbone \u03c6 and \u03c8 restraints and their respective uncertainties were obtained from the \"GOOD\" dihedrals generated by TALOS+ based on the backbone chemical shift values. e Statistics are calculated and averaged over an ensemble of the 15 lowest energy structures out of 150 calculated structures. f The precision of the atomic coordinates is defined as the average r.m.s. difference between the 15 final structures and their mean coordinates (flexible residues 711-740 have been omitted from the comparison).",

            "text": "Evidence of CT LLP2 -TMD interaction from OG-label analysis. a, Determination of the oligomerization state of the CT LLP2 reconstituted in bicelles by OG-label analysis (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1b for OG-label description). The SDS-PAGE gel lanes are: 1 -CT LLP2 (monomeric in SDS); 2 -GB1*; 3 -GB1* cross-linked alone; 4-7 -GB1* cross-linked in the presence of CT LLP2 at increasing cross-linker concentration. The increasing and decreasing strength of the dimer and monomer bands in lanes 4-7, respectively, compared to those in the control lane 3, suggests that the CT LLP2 can form dimers. The experiment was performed once. b, Oligomerization state of the CT LLP2 reconstituted in bicelles in the presence of the TMD-KS by OG-label analysis. The gel lanes are: 1 -GB1*; 2 -TMD-KS and CT LLP2 (trimeric and monomeric is SDS); 3 -GB1* cross-linked alone; 4-7 -GB1* cross-linked in the presence of CT LLP2 and TMD-KS at increasing cross-linker concentration. The experiment was performed once. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Supplementary Fig. 10 | Epitope mapping of the antibodies used in the pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. Side and top views of gp120 in the closed (prefusion state, left) 6 and open (CD4-bound) 7 conformations are shown. Locations of V1V2 loops, V3 loop and CD4 binding site (CD4bs) are highlighted in green, orange and magenta, respectively. Trimer-specific bnAbs such as PG9, PG16 and PGT145 can bind to the V1V2 loops only when the Env is in the closed conformation, while nonneutralizing or strain-specific neutralizing antibodies such as b6 (CD4bs), 3791 (V3) and 17b (CD4-induced) can bind to the Env only in the open conformation.

Env samples prepared from 293T cells transiently transfected with 1 \uf06dg of the HIV-1 gp92UG037.8 gp160 expression plasmid or of each CT mutant were detected by an anti-V3 antibody 3791.

For each of the viruses, including the CAEV (caprine arthritis encephalitis virus), EIAV (equine infectious anemia virus), BIV (bovine immunodeficiency virus), and MVV (maedi/visna virus), the cytoplasmic tail (CT) sequence of the viral fusion protein was subject to protein secondary structure prediction using three different programs: AGADIR 8 , APSSP 9 , and PSIPRED 10 . The sources of the sequences are: UniProtKB D1M7T1 (CAEV), UniProtKB P32541 (EIAV), UniProtKB P19557 (BIV), and UniProtKB P03379) (MVV).
