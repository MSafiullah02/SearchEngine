A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of the disease (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003, Hsueh et al., 2003). SARS-CoV particle contains a single positive-stranded RNA genome encoding for replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid (Lai, 2003, Enjuanes et al., 2001, Holmes, 2003). The SARS-CoV 3CLpro mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides into functional proteins, playing an important role in viral replication. Therefore, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be considered an attractive target for developing effective drugs against SARS. Several potential 3CLpro inhibitors with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) below 10 \u03bcM were identified from the large number of the structurally diverse small molecules (Kao et al., 2004, Hsu et al., 2004).",

I. indigotica root (Radix isatidis), belonging to the family Cruciferae, is native to China. Antiviral effects of I. indigotica root were found against influenza, hepatitis A and Japanese encephalitis (Qin and Xu, 1998, Wu et al., 1997). I. indigotica root contains indigo, indirubin, indican (indoxyl-\u03b2-d-glucoside), \u03b2-sitosterol, \u03b3-sitosterol, sinigrin, etc. (Gilbert et al., 2004). Indigo and indirubin were identified as the promiscuous chymotrypsin inhibitors (McGovern and Shoichet, 2003). Recently, an anti-influenza virus effect of indirubin has been demonstrated (Mak et al., 2004). In addition, several herb-derived phenolics aloeemodin, hesperetin, quercetin, and naringenin have been accredited with antiviral effects against poliovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, parainfluenza virus, and vaccinia virus (Semple et al., 2001, Andersen et al., 1991, Paredes et al., 2003, Kim et al., 2001).",

Coomassie Blue-staining revealed that recombinant 3CLpro contained a major 34-kDa band for the monomer and a minor 68-kDa band for the dimer (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The cleavage substrate (TVRLQAGNATE) was generated as the substrate fusion protein with the N-terminal S-Tag and the C-terminal HSV-Tag. In the cell-free cleavage assay, the substrate fusion protein that was captured by anti-HSV-Tag antibodies in wells incubated with soluble 3CLpro for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. The non-cleavage substrate protein was detected by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using peroxidase-conjugated S protein. ELISA showed that cell-free proteolytic activity correlated, in concentration-dependent manner, with the serial twofold dilution of recombinant 3CLpro protein in the range from 15 \u03bcg/ml to 240 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, the anti-3CLpro effect by the extract of I. indigotica root was evaluated using the cell-free cleavage assay. The cell-free cleavage assay indicated that the extract of I. indigotica root had a dose-dependent anti-3CLpro effect with an IC50 of 53.8 \u00b1 4.2 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 2\n; Table 1\n).",

            "text": "The cell-based cleavage assay of 3CLpro for screening inhibitors does not require purification of the active 3CLpro, and represents closely the natural physiological state. Therefore, we used the cell-based cleavage assay for examining the inhibitory efficacy of the 3CLpro inhibitors. For the cell-based cleavage assay, the in-frame construction of the 3CLpro, the substrate, and the luciferase, designed as the plasmid pcDNA3.1-3CLpro-S-Luc, was co-transfected with the indicated vector pEGFP-N1 into Vero cells. The stable cell clone for the expression of the 3CLpro\u2013substrate\u2013luciferase fusion protein was selected by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 800 \u03bcg/ml of neomycin G418 (Fig. 3A). Since a more than 30 kDa protein fused at the N-terminus of the luciferase resulted in a dramatic decrease of luciferase activity (Joubert et al., 2000), the detection of luciferase activity could be considered as a measure for the cis-cleavage by the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Western blotting with the anti-luciferase monoclonal antibody showed a 94-kDa band for the fusion protein 3CLpro-S-Luc and a 60-kDa band for the luciferase in Vero cells transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3.1-3CLpro-S-Luc (data not shown). The relative luciferase activity in the transfected cells was subsequently measured using the dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Fig. 3B). In the cell-based cleavage assay, the extract of I. indigotica root significantly inhibited the cis-cleavage activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with an IC50 of 191.6 \u00b1 8.2 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 4\n; Table 1). The IC50 value from cell-based assay by the I. indigotica root extract was twofold higher than the IC50 value from the cell-free assay. The reason may be that the I. indigotica root extract could contain some inhibitory compounds that cannot permeate cellular membranes to reach intracellular SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The results of cell-free and cell-based cleavage assays demonstrated that the I. indigotica root extract might contain potent anti-SARS-CoV 3CLpro compounds.",

Of the five compounds, sinigrin, beta-sitosterol and indigo dose-dependently inhibited cleavage activities of the 3CLpro in cell-free and cell-based assays (Fig. 5, Table 1). The IC50 in the cell-free assays was 115 \u03bcM for beta-sitosterol, 121 \u03bcM for sinigrin, and 300 \u03bcM for indigo. The cell-based assay indicated that sinigrin (IC50: 217 \u03bcM) was more efficient in blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CLpro than indigo (IC50: 752 \u03bcM) and beta-sitosterol (IC50: 1210 \u03bcM). Sinigrin showed a strong correlation between the effects on cell-free and cell-based cleavage of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Moreover, indigo (CC50: 7.4 mM) and sinigrin (CC50: >10 mM) were not toxic to Vero cells. Sinigrin, an antioxidant, has been reported to possess inhibitory effects on quinine reductase and glutathione S-transferase, antiproliferative effects against cancer cells, and antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brabban and Edwards, 1995, Munday and Munday, 2002, Smith et al., 2004). This study is the first report in that sinigrin significantly blocks the cleavage processing of a viral protease.",

Only two of the phenolic compounds, aloeemodin and hesperetin dose-dependently inhibited cleavage activity of the 3CLpro in cell-free and cell-based assays (Fig. 6; Table 1). In the cell-free assay, the IC50 values were 132 \u03bcM for aloe emodin and 60 \u03bcM for hesperetin. Quercetin has been reported to block the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells (Yi et al., 2004). However, no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV 3CLpro was found for quercetin in the cell-free and cell-based cleavage assays. Interestingly, hesperetin (CC50: 2.7 mM) had an IC50 of 8.3 \u03bcM in the cell-based assay (Table 1). Hesperetin is poorly soluble in water; so, hesperetin was less inhibitory in the cell-free assay than in the cell-based assay. The finding of the anti-3CLpro effects of hesperetin at the micromolar range was consistent with a previous report indicating that hesperetin had an inhibitory activity on Sindbis virus infection with an IC50 of 20.5 \u03bcg/ml (about 68 \u03bcM) by plaque assay (Paredes et al., 2003). Of the compounds tested, hesperetin was the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Table 1).",
