The Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammatorquevirus genera contain anelloviruses that infect humans. TTV infections are commonly acquired during early childhood during which the virus establishes a chronic productive infection with long-lasting detectable viremia [23]. TTVs are endemic worldwide and can be detected in blood and various tissues in the body, including cerebrospinal and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid samples [23]. TTV (genus Alphatorquevirus) is classified into at least 29 genotypes with nucleotide divergence of >30%, consisting of 5 major genetic groups (groups 1\u20135) with a sequence divergence of >50% [23\u201325]. For TTMV (genus Betatorquevirus), highly divergent groups have been proposed [21, 26, 27], and for TTMDV (genus Gammatorquevirus), approximately 33% sequence diversity has been observed across full-length genomes [28].",

Because SHAPU has only been described in Nepal, we hypothesized the existence of a specific SHAPU-inducing TTV variant. Genomes of TTV isolates share low DNA sequence homology [16]. However, a short stretch (\u223c130 bp) of the intergenic nontranslated region is identified as being highly conserved among all human TTV isolates and is used to both demonstrate TTV infections and to genotype clinical isolates [16]. To test our hypothesis, we cloned and sequenced VF-derived amplicons (\u223c8 clones per VF sample) from this particular genomic region from 10 SHAPU patients. Multiple different TTV variants (average 2.3 variants, range 1\u20135) were observed in 7 of 10 SHAPU samples. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was created using the ocular-derived SHAPU TTV amplicons and corresponding sequences of TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV strains previously deposited in the GenBank database (Figure 3). The SHAPU-associated TTV sequences showed 70%\u2013100% similarity to each other, but they did not belong to the same phylogenetic clade. Moreover, SHAPU TTV sequences from the same sample often did not group together, suggesting that patients are infected with multiple different TTV variants or even genotypes.\n",

Multiple different TTV variants were detected in the serum (average \u223c2.6 variants, range 1\u20135) and VF (average \u223c3 variants, range 1\u20135) samples.

SHAPU patients were usually children <10 years of age who underwent a therapeutic vitrectomy commonly within the first week of disease, the treatment of choice to preserve visual acuity in SHAPU patients [1, 2]. Non-SHAPU patients, however, were all adults and were first treated symptomatically using antibiotics, antivirals, and/or corticosteroids. Therapeutic vitrectomy was applied as a second treatment option, usually multiple weeks after onset of disease (data not shown). In herpesvirus- and T. gondii\u2013induced infectious uveitis, the intraocular viral and parasitic load is inversely correlated with duration of disease, mainly owing to effectiveness of the local immune response evoked upon intraocular infection [2, 38\u201342]. Because significant differences in intraocular viral loads in TTV PCR-positive SHAPU and non-SHAPU VF samples were not observed, it is unlikely that disease duration influences the detection of anellovirus. The high incidence of SHAPU in young children contrasts with the increased risk of uveitis with increasing age [43\u201345]. Children may be more prone to ocular infection with anelloviruses than are adults, as was previously described for other viral diseases such as the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus [46].",

Ocular inflammation causes perturbation of the blood-ocular barrier, specifically barrier permeability, in many models of retinal disease [29]. Because anellovirus infections cause a chronic plasma viremia in most infected individuals [23], detection of anelloviruses in VF samples may be the result of passive entry of blood-derived anelloviruses into the vitreous cavity due to breakdown of the blood-retina barrier in uveitis patients. Indeed, most of the SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients with anellovirus-positive VF also had TTV, TTMDV, and/or TTMV viremia. Moreover, the median TTV load in VF was relatively low compared with that previously described in serum of viremic individuals [23]. These observations, in conjunction with the phylogenetic analysis of TTV in the paired serum and VF samples, suggest that the anelloviruses in VF samples of both SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients have most likely originated from the systemic TTV pool upon inflammation-induced disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. However, exogenous sources of the anelloviruses in VF cannot be ruled out. For example, the VF sample of SHAPU patient SV-2 was TTMDV PCR positive in the absence of a detectable TTMDV viremia (Table 1).",

Notably, SHAPU patients document close contact with white moths [1, 2, 4], and moth hairs have incidentally been detected in corneas or even in the anterior chamber of SHAPU patients (A. Manandhar, unpublished observation). Cornea-penetrating moth hairs could cause intraocular inflammation, allowing passive entry of anelloviruses into the vitreous cavity from the bloodstream. Alternatively, the ocular-penetrating hairs may be contaminated with anelloviruses, resulting in direct inoculation of the virus into the eye. This scenario, although less likely, is plausible because anelloviruses have also been detected in river water, sewage, and polluted superficial waters worldwide [49, 50].",
