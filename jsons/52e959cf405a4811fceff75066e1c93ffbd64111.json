            "text": "Purpose: As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been growing recognition of risks to the anesthesia and surgical teams that require careful consideration to ensure optimal patient care. Airway management and other head and neck procedures risk exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, droplets, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides guidance on optimal practice approaches for performing patient evaluation and management of head and neck procedures with the shared goal of providing safe and effective patient care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. Methods: The scientific literature was evaluated, focusing on strategies to reduce risk to health care workers involved in airway management and head and neck surgery. The search strategy involved curating consensus statements and guidelines relating to COVID-19 or prior coronavirus outbreaks in relation to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and other high-risk procedures, with the search restricted to the scope of head and neck anesthesia. A multidisciplinary team analyzed the findings, using iterative virtual communications through video conference, telephone, email, and shared online documents until consensus was achieved, loosely adapted from the Delphi technique. Items without consensus were so indicated or removed from the manuscript. Results: Health care worker infection and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and prior outbreaks mandate robust standards for infection control. Most head and neck anesthesiology procedures generate aerosols, and algorithms may be modified to mitigate risks. Examples include preoxygenation before induction of anesthesia, rapid sequence induction, closing circuits expeditiously, and consideration of apneic technique for surgical entry of airway. Rescue measures are also modified, with supraglottic airways elevated in the difficult airway algorithm to minimize the need for bag mask ventilation. Personal protective equipment for AGPs include fit-tested N95 mask (or purified air positive respirator), gloves, goggles, and gown for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Meticulous donning and doffing technique, minimizing personnel and room traffic, diligent hand hygiene, and social distancing all can decrease risks. Perioperative management approaches may differ from commonly employed patterns including avoidance of techniques such as jet ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and instead utilizing techniques with a closed ventilatory circuit and secured endotracheal tube, minimizing open suctioning, and preventing aerosolization at emergence. Recommendations are made for the following head and neck procedures and considerations: primary airway management; high-flow nasal oxygen delivery; jet ventilation for laryngotracheal surgery; awake intubation; transnasal skull base surgery; tracheostomy; and use of personal protective equipment. COVID-19 testing may facilitate decision making, but it is currently often unavailable and urgency of surgical treatment must be considered. Conclusions: During pandemics, head and neck anesthesia and surgical teams have a duty to not only provide high quality patient care but also to ensure the safety of the health care team. Several specific perioperative approaches are recommended that have some variance from commonly employed practices, focusing on the reduction of AGP to minimize the risk of infection from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.",

Recommendations exist for general airway management procedures (including tracheal intubation, bag-mask ventilation, and laryngeal mask insertion) in patients suspected of, or infected with SAR-CoV-2 [18, 19] ( Table 1) . Several of these recommendations also highlight the importance of teamwork, preparation, communication, and safety verifications in addition to procedural approaches [20] . Use of novel devices for airway management, such as barrier enclosures (ie, boxes, drapes) may help to limit aerosolization during intubation, extubation, and/or with use of oxygen delivery devices (Fig. 1 ). Yet they still remain unproven and may introduce challenges, such as limited range of motion or impaired Appropriate respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE) is required for all providers present during airway management (ensure appropriate donning and doffing) Avoid awake (spontaneously breathing) intubation techniques if possible The procedure should be performed in a negative pressure environment if possible, or consideration should be made for adequate air circulation The most experienced provider should perform laryngoscopy to optimize first attempt success at tracheal intubation A high quality Heat and Moisture Exchange Filter (HMEF) should be used; placed between the facemask and reservoir bag during preoxygenation and between the endotracheal tube and ventilatory circuit after successful tracheal intubation [19] Preoxygenation for a minimum of 5 minutes with 100% FiO 2 and tight mask seal The use of videolaryngoscopy as the primary laryngoscopy approach is recommended (to optimize 1st attempt success and distance the laryngoscopist from the patient's oral and nasal mucosa) Perform a rapid sequence induction to avoid manual bag-mask ventilation If rescue oxygenation/ventilation is required between laryngoscopy attempts; apply very small tidal volumes and ensure a tight seal, or consider the insertion of a supraglottic airway device (i.e. LMA) Ensure the tracheal cuff of the endotracheal tube is inflated, and HMEF connected directly to the endotracheal tube connector before initiating positive pressure ventilation visualization [21, 22] . Further investigation is needed to define the role of such devices. Certain procedures warrant special attention, due to their predilection for generating infectious aerosols. These procedures include awake flexible endoscopic intubation; use of high-frequency jet ventilation; transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE); and high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO). Although data are limited on the magnitude of aerosol generation associated with various procedures, experimental studies document that procedures that generate air currents with aerosol are conducive to wider spread [23] . A variety of AGPs may be encountered during patient care including multiple heads and neck operative, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures ( Table 2 ) [18, [23] [24] [25] .",

If a nebulized solution of local anesthetic is used for topicalization, this can theoretically cause aerosolization and may compound the risk of infection to health care providers [26] . The perceived risk of nebulizers is not universally accepted, and previous studies performed during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak did not link the use of nebulizers to the transmission of infection [23, 27] . Nonetheless, the procedure can cause gagging and coughing, which increases the risk of the droplet and aerosol spread. Flexible laryngoscopy by surgical providers is similarly considered to be a high risk [28] . Given these risks, current guidance from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation recommends avoiding awake endoscopic (fiberoptic) intubation in patients with suspected coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) infection, unless specifically indicated [19] .",

The \"swish and swallow\" technique is unlikely to lead to coughing or aerosolization, as is judiciously delivered local anesthesia via an atomizer directly onto mucosa. Regional techniques may also be considered although these too can cause patient reaction with coughing and viral spread.

This would result in a single aerosolization procedure being performed, instead of two. Awake tracheostomy presents a high risk of aerosolization and should be performed with caution, using surgical and anesthetic techniques that minimize aerosol generation [29] .",

High-frequency jet ventilation can also be delivered through a cannula cricothyroidotomy in emergency front of neck access [30, 31] . During the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003, the use of jet ventilation in a patient presenting with respiratory infection resulted in a super spreading event linked to 138 infections, many of whom were health care workers [13] . Given its characteristic high frequency and pressure, jet ventilation entails a high risk of aerosolization and the dissemination of viruses when used during open airway procedures. During the pandemic, we recommend against jet ventilation for rescue in a cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate event. In such instances, a scalpel bougie technique is preferred to aerosolization without a secured cuffed tube. Also for laryngotracheal procedures, consideration should be made for intermittent apnea techniques that permit mechanical ventilation through a closed airway circuit. This approach uses a secured airway with ventilation to minimize the risk of aerosolization and is supported by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery [32] .",

Nonetheless, HFNO has been utilized in many intensive care units, based on the premise that it may obviate the need for intubation in some patients; this stance continues to be debated [33, 38, 39] . If HFNO is used, the patient should ideally be placed in a negative pressure environment; although devices that limit aerosolization or distribution are also an option [40] . Prior investigation with HFNO in simulation did not find it to increase the risk of droplet and contact infection [34] , however, in the operating room, intermittent apnea should be utilized over apneic oxygenation via HFNO whenever possible. If HFNO is utilized, facemask protection should be placed on the patient to limit aerosolization. In patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory compromise, the use of HFNO to maintain apneic oxygenation is unlikely to be as effective as in healthy patients [41, 42] .",

Tracheostomy should not be performed in patients with unstable pulmonary status nor sooner than 10-21 days weeks from initial intubation, preferably once the viral load has decreased (viral RNA can sometimes be detected by PCR for up to 20 days from symptom onset; however, the immune response is often activated and this virus is typically culture negative at these later time points). In addition, clinicians should bear in mind that days intubated will usually underestimate the duration elapsed since infection [45] .

In a review of the 2009 Influenza A Pandemic (H1N1), the CDC recommended that providers involved in AGP wear at a minimum an N95 respirator and may consider a powered air-purifying system (PAPR). The PAPR was shown to provide 2.5-100 times greater protection than the N95 [53] . The N95 efficacy is limited by the potential for face seal leakage, which is not always predicted by fit testing. Following the SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks in 2003, it was found that 9% of health care workers that intubated patients contracted SARS [54] , suggesting that aggressive measures were required to protect health care workers from the viral transmission. The PAPR system is not without drawbacks as it requires appropriate assembly, maintenance, donning, doffing, and handling once it enters into the care setting and becomes contaminated.

Nasopharyngeal swabs have demonstrated greater sensitivity than oropharyngeal swabs [59] , and as a single negative test may be misleading, some recommend repeated testing after a single negative test [59] . In addition to diagnostic tests identifying the presence of the virus, serological tests exist to measure the number of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to COVID-19. Antibody tests have been positive in 90% of infected individuals by 11-24 days after infection [61, 62] . While limitations exist to these tests' effectiveness for diagnosing prior COVID-19 infection, these serological tests can play a critical role in the fight against COVID-19 by helping health care professionals identify individuals who have overcome infection and developed an immune response. Despite improvements in serological detection, a further consideration is that the degree and duration of protection afforded through immunity after infection with SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain [56, 63] . While COVID-19 infection remains prevalent, testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals is advisable before proceeding with head and neck surgical procedures.
