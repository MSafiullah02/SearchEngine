            "text": "The widely studied key reference models for infectious disease epidemics are the homogeneous mixing models where any member of the population can infect or be infected by any other member of the population; see, for example, Anderson and May (1991) and Brauer (2008). The advantage of a homogeneous mixing model is that it lends itself relatively well to analysis and therefore is a good starting point. Due to the homogeneity assumption, these models predict that the fraction of the population that needs to be vaccinated to curtail an epidemic is equal to 1\u22121/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population). However, the homogeneous mixing assumption poorly reflects the actual interactions within a population, since, for example, school children and office co-workers spend significant amounts of time in close proximity and therefore are much more likely to infect each other than an elderly person who mostly stays at home. Consequently, efforts have been made to incorporate the network structure into models, where individuals are represented by nodes and contacts are presented by edges. In the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it was shown by Meyers et al. (2005) that the incorporation of contact networks may yield different epidemic outcomes even for the same basic reproduction number R0. For pandemic influenza H1N1/09, Pourbohloul et al. (2009) and Davoudi et al. (2012) used network theory to obtain a real time estimate for R0. Numerical simulations have shown that different networks can yield distinct disease spread patterns; see, for example, Bansal et al. (2007), Miller et al. (2012), and Section 7.6 in Keeling and Rohani (2008). To illustrate this difference for the networks and parameters we use, the effect of different networks on disease dynamics is shown in Fig. 1\n. Descriptions of these networks are given in Section 2 and Appendix B.",

For example, Volz (2008) used a generating function formalism (an alternate derivation with a simpler system of equations was recently found by Miller, 2011), while we used the degree distribution in the effective degree model presented in Lindquist et al. (2011). In these models, the degree distribution is the key network characteristic for disease dynamics. From recent efforts (Ma et al., 2012, Volz et al., 2011, Moreno et al., 2003, Salath\u00e9 and Jones, 2010) on incorporating degree correlation and clustering (such as households and offices) into epidemic models, it has been found that these may significantly affect the disease dynamics for networks with identical degree distributions. Fig. 2\nshows disease dynamics on networks with identical degree distribution and disease parameters, but with different network topologies. Clearly, reliable predictions of the epidemic process that only use the degree distribution are not possible without knowledge of the network topology. Such predictions need to be checked by considering other topological properties of the network.",

For example, Shaban et al. (2008) consider a random graph with a pre-specified degree distribution to investigate vaccination models using contact tracing. Kiss et al. (2006) compared the efficacy of contact tracing on random and scale-free networks and found that for transmission rates greater than a certain threshold, the final epidemic size is smaller on a scale-free network than on a corresponding random network, while they considered the effects of degree correlations in Kiss et al. (2008). Cohen et al. (2003) (see also Madar et al., 2004) considered different vaccination strategies on scale-free networks and found that acquaintance immunization is remarkably effective. Miller and Hyman (2007) considered several vaccination strategies on a simulation of the population of Portland Oregon, USA, and found it to be most effective to vaccinate nodes with the most unvaccinated susceptible contacts, although they found that this strategy may not be practical because it requires considerable computational resources and information about the network. Bansal et al. (2006) took a contact network using data from Vancouver, BC, Canada, considered two vaccination strategies, namely mortality- and morbidity-based, and investigated the detrimental effect of vaccination delays.

Thus, how different network topologies affect various vaccination strategies remains of considerable interest. To address this question, we explore two scenarios to compare percentage reduction by vaccination on the final size of epidemics across various network topologies. First, various network topologies are considered with the disease parameters constant, assuming that these have been independently estimated. Second, different network topologies are used to fit to the observed incidence curve (number of new infections in each day), so that their disease parameters are different yet they all line up to the same initial exponential growth phase of the epidemic.",

The per link transmission rate \u03b2 is difficult to obtain directly and is usually derived as a secondary quantity. To determine \u03b2, we pick the basic reproduction number R0=1.5 and the recovery rate \u03b3=0.2, which are close to that of the influenza A H1N1/09 virus; see, for example, Pourbohloul et al. (2009), Tuite et al. (2010). In the case of the homogeneous mixing SIR model, the basic reproduction number is given by R0=\u03c4/\u03b3, where \u03c4 is the per-node transmission rate. Our parameter values yield \u03c4=0.3. For networks, \u03c4=\u03b2\u3008k\u3009. With the assumption that the average degree \u3008k\u3009=5, the above gives the per-link transmission rate \u03b2=0.06. The key parameters are summarized in Table 4\n. In Section 3, we use this transmission rate to compare the incidence curves for the networks in Table 1 with the vaccination strategies in Table 3.",

In turn, once a high degree node is infected, on average it passes on the infection to a large number of neighbors. The random and meta-random networks show identical initial growth rates because they have the same local network topology. On different network topologies, diseases respond differently to parameter changes. For example, on the random network, a higher transmission rate yields a much shorter epidemic, whereas on the meta-random network, it yields a longer one with a more drastic increase in final size. These differences are caused by the spatial structures in the meta-random network. Considering that a meta-random network is a random network of random networks, it is likely that the meta-random network represents a general population better than a random network.",
