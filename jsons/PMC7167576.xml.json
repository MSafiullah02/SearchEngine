The reader may be referred to the website of the French Society of Otorhinolaryngological Society (https://www.sforl.org/), where recommendations on this subject are regularly updated. For these patients, a teleconsultation should preferably be suggested if feasible. Face-to-face consultations should be decided after team discussion. In those selected cases, even if flexible endoscopy is not required and if the patient is relatively unlikely to have COVID-19, the examination must be performed carefully and both the patient and the caregiver must wear a surgical mask. When a flexible endoscopy is performed, the usual PPE used in any airway procedure is required: head cap, FFP2 mask, protective glasses and possibly a full-face protection with protective visor, gloves and a gown.Key points\n\u2022Vocal rehabilitation should not be considered urgent in the current epidemic context. If the patient has already been taken care of for such a rehabilitation, this can be continued by tele-rehabilitation.\u2022The current recommendations therefore mainly concern the management of swallowing disorders and the assessment of acute dysphonia.\u2022Since we are currently in the COVID-19 pandemic phase, even asymptomatic patients can be infected and contagious, and as false negatives from coronavirus diagnostic tests are frequent, the same precautions should apply to all patients.\u2022Only swallowing disorders management or exploration of recent dysphonia that are regarded as impossible to postpone should be maintained. The decision to maintain these urgent indications must be validated by team discussions or should rely on official recommendations from health authorities.\u2022Several procedures are to be considered as at very high risk of caregiver contamination: clinical and flexible endoscopic swallowing assessments (especially since food tests require that the patient not wear a mask), flexible endoscopies, insertions of nasogastric tubes and video fluoroscopic swallowing exams, although the risk level of the latter remains under discussion.\u2022When these risky procedures cannot be postponed, the following personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for caregivers: protective glasses, FFP2 (N95) mask, cap, gloves and gown. Caregivers must learn the appropriate dressing and undressing technique.\n\n",
