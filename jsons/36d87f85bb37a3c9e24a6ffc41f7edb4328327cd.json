It first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan city, located in the Hubei region of China, and was soon followed by a quick spread to nearby provinces of China and to neighboring countries. As of March 30th, 2020, the infection has been reported from 198 countries, and has affected more than 700,000 people worldwide, with more than 33,000 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/ coronavirus/). COVID-19 most often presents with a recent-onset fever, dry cough, weakness, and sore throat. 1 Up to 50% of patients may report shortness of breath, and a few develop adult respiratory distress syndrome. Nasal symptoms are infrequent. Asymptomatic infection can occur; however, in the absence of a serological test, its frequency remains unclear. The case fatality rate has been reported between 1% and 3.5% but may depend on case definition; for instance, if milder cases or asymptomatic persons are tested, diagnosed and included in the case count, the morality rate would appear to be low. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily via direct contact through air droplets. The mean incubation period is 5 (range: 0-14) days. Spread from asymptomatic persons in the late incubation period can occur; however, most of the viral spread appears to occur from symptomatic persons. Older people, especially those with comorbidities and the immune compromised individuals are at particular risk of severe disease and death.",

While sharing information about patients over such tools, the issues related to patient confidentiality must receive due attention. In the event of an outbreak in the department/hospital, it is most appropriate to follow the institutional guidance. It seems appropriate for each unit/department to have more than one team of doctors and other staff working on rotation basis, to ensure that it is able to provide uninterrupted service. A schedule may be drawn, whereby one group attends the hospital for a specified number of days and the other group follows the next days. This may help avoid the risk of whole department needing quarantine in case of a high-risk exposure to a patient or another health-care worker in the hospital, resulting in the entire department closing down.",

The recommended dosage for this purpose is 400 mg (taken with meals) twice a day on day 1, followed by 400 mg once weekly for next 7 weeks. 12 However, it is pertinent to point out that data to support this recommendation are limited to a French study in treatment (and not prophylaxis) setting, which had a nonrandomized, unblinded design with small sample size (treated cohort 26, untreated 16; derived from different hospitals and hence not necessarily comparable), and different dropout rates (6/26 and 0/16, respectively) in the two cohorts. Of the 20 patients who received hydroxychloroquine, 7 also took azithromycin. Further, it compared a surrogate outcome (absence of viral RNA on day 6), and it was unclear whether this was decided on a priori (before the study started). 13 In addition, the use of chemoprophylaxis carries the risk of adverse events and of instilling a false sense of security with reduced adherence to safety precautions. The recommendations for quarantine may change over time, if the community spread of coronavirus becomes common.",

All such patients should follow the guidelines of the MoHFW, Government of India, for general public, which are meant to minimize exposure to the COVID-19, especially social distancing and frequent hand washing. 5 In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, there is no recommendation to pause the immunosuppressive treatment at the moment. Often, the risk of flare of the original disease may outweigh the chance of contracting COVID-19, necessitating the continuation of such drugs. [14] [15] [16] Patient with cirrhosis (even Child A) and those with prior liver transplantation should be discouraged from visiting a clinic or hospital, unless absolutely essential. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be considered for inpatient treatment only if there is a pressing indication for admission e.g. acute GI bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, tense ascites causing respiratory distress, liver cancer requiring locoregional therapy, or liver transplantation. Endoscopic variceal ligation as primary prophylaxis should be postponed till 4-6 weeks later, or till threat of COVID-19 infection has passed and beta-blockers should be preferred till then. Routine liver biopsies should be postponed for at least 4-6 weeks unless it is being carried out for confirming malignancy or an illness such as autoimmune hepatitis or acute cellular rejection. Postliver transplant patients should continue their standard immunosuppression till further data becomes available, (For more on COVD-19 and liver transplantation in India, please see Liver Transplantation Society of India guidance). 17 Liver transplantation recipients with COVID-19 infection should be monitored for drug-drug interactions, if they are prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir antiviral therapy because ritonavir is a potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor and can increase the levels of calcineurin inhibitors. (American Society of Transplantation Guidance). 18 Each hospital or clinic should adopt measures, as locally suitable and acceptable, and as per the regional or state policies and the local risk of occurrence of COVID-19 outbreak.",
