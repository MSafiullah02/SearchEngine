            "text": "Pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), perceive tissue alterations and initiate local innate immune responses. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, encode TLRs which primary role is to protect the tissue integrity. However, deregulated activation of TLRs in microglia may lead to chronic neurodegeneration. This double role of microglial responses is often reported in immune-driven neurologic diseases, as in multiple sclerosis (MS). Consequently, strategies to manipulate microglia inflammatory responses may help to ameliorate disease progression. In this context, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 appears as an attractive target. In this study, we investigated how activation of microglia by TLRs with distinct roles in MS impacts on IL-10 production. We found that activation of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 induced the production of IL-10 to a greater extent than activation of TLR3. This was surprising as both TLR3 and IL-10 play protective roles in animal models of MS. Interestingly, combination of TLR3 triggering with the other TLRs, enhanced IL-10 through the modulation of its transcription, via interferon (IFN)-b, but independently of IL-27. Thus, in addition to the modulation of inflammatory responses of the periphery described for the axis TLR3/ IFN-b, we now report a direct modulation of microglial responses. We further show that the presence of IFN-g in the microenvironment abrogated the modulation of IL-10 by TLR3, whereas that of IL-17 had no effect. Considering the therapeutic application of IFN-b in MS, our study bears important implications for the understanding of the cytokine network regulating microglia responses in this setting.",

            "text": "Microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS (Hanisch & Kettenmann, 2007) , play an important role in patrolling the parenchymal tissue, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis and the initiation of innate immune responses in the brain (Kettenmann, Hanisch, Noda, & Verkhratsky, 2011; Perry & Teeling, 2013; Ransohoff & Brown, 2012) . In line with their myeloid origin, microglia express numerous pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), among which toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Eggen, Raj, Hanisch, & Boddeke, 2013; Shastri et al., 2013) , involved in the recognition of pathogen-or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively). Upregulation and activation of several TLRs in microglia has been described as a protective mechanism during infection by viruses, bacteria and parasites (Sochocka et al., 2016) . In the context of neurodegeneration, the initial activation of microglia (and other glial cells) by DAMPs plays a pivotal role in repairing injury and maintaining the CNS homeostasis, but with the increase in neuronal death, this very same activation further potentiates cell death, thus enhancing neurodegeneration (Hanke & Kielian, 2011; Hayward & Lee, 2014; Kigerl, de Rivero Vaccari, Dietrich, Popovich, & Keane, 2014; Shastri et al., 2013; Su, Bai, Zhou, & Zhang, 2016) . Consequently, it is conceived that regulating the activation of microglia, for example, through TLRs, may allow the regulation of several neurological diseases (Pedras-Vasconcelos, Puig, & Verthelyi, 2009 ). TLR responses are mediated by the intracellular adaptor molecules myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and TIRdomain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF) (Kawai & Akira, 2010; Pandey, Kawai, & Akira, 2014) . Most TLRs signal uniquely via MyD88, the exceptions being TLR4, which signals via both MyD88 and TRIF, and TLR3, which signals uniquely through TRIF (Kawai & Akira, 2010) . Both MyD88 and TRIF initiate a series of intracellular signaling cascades that culminate with the production of several immune mediators, as cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide (Kawai & Akira, 2010) . MyD88-dependent signals efficiently activate the NF-kB family of transcription factors, leading to the production of many cytokines, as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1b, and also IL-10 (Pandey et al., 2014) . TRIF-mediated signals induce interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other IFN-responsive factors (Pandey et al., 2014) . Of all these cytokines, two have been associated with protection during neurodegeneration: type I IFNs and IL-10.",

The production of IL-10 by TLR-activated microglia is well documented (Butchi, Du, & Peterson, 2010; Jack et al., 2005; Ledeboer et al., 2002; Mizuno, Sawada, Marunouchi, & Suzumura, 1994; Olson & Miller, 2004) . The potential of IL-10 in controlling inflammatory responses in the brain has gained recent importance (Kwilasz, Grace, Serbedzija, Maier, & Watkins, 2015) . IL-10 has been tested as a therapeutic approach to a series of neurologic pathologies, where excessive and persistent neuroinflammation acts as a driver of neurodegeneration. Examples of this include the administration of IL-10 in animal models of brain ischemia (Perez-de Puig et al., 2013) , Parkinson's disease (Joniec-Maciejak et al., 2014) , and MS (Cua, Hutchins, LaFace, Stohlman, & Coffman, 2001) . There are, however situations, such as in Alzheimer s disease, where a detrimental role for IL-10 has been shown (Chakrabarty et al., 2015; Guillot-Sestier et al., 2015) . In either case, modulating IL-10 in the CNS appears as an attractive approach to rewire otherwise detrimental immune responses. This calls for a deep understanding on the molecular mechanisms regulating IL-10 production in the brain, something that remains poorly studied (Lobo-Silva, Carriche, Castro, Roque, & Saraiva, 2016) .",

Of the 13 cytokines tested, IL-9 and IL-17 were consistently below detection level for all the TLR agonists studied. Also below detection level were all the tested cytokines in nonstimulated cells. We observed that whereas certain cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-b, IFN-g, IL-4, and IL-5; Figure   1a -g) were greatly dependent on the TLR triggered, others (TNF, IL-23, IL-27, and IL-22; Figure 1h -k) were produced in equivalent amounts, independently of the stimulus. Within the first group, it was interesting to note that TLR3 was the poorest inducer of cytokine production ( Figure   1a -g), with the exception of IFN-b (Figure 1d ), which was induced at higher levels upon TLR3 stimulation of microglia. Furthermore, the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 ( Figure 1a ) by microglia was among the most affected by the type of TLR stimulated. Indeed, IL-10 production varied from the highest amounts induced downstream of TLR9 triggering, to barely detectable ones downstream of TLR3 ( Figure 1a ). These differential responses were not dependent on the dose of agonist used to stimulate microglia, as increasing the doses of TLR ligands did not result in enhanced secretion of IL-10, nor of TNF (Supporting Information, Figure   1 ). In particular, increasing the doses of TLR3 agonist did not improve IL-10 secretion, which was for most of the cases below detection level (data not shown). We then tested whereas non-TLR stimuli would also induce IL-10 production by microglia. We found that IL-10 production was also triggered by fungal ligands for the PRR dectin-1 (Supporting Information, Figure 2a ). The combined stimulation dectin-1/TLR2 was a more potent stimulus than either independent one (Supporting Information, Figure 2a ), being the same pattern was observed for TNF production (Supporting Information, Figure 2b ). Finally, we compared the production of IL-10 upon TLR stimulation of microglia to that of myeloid cells of the periphery, namely primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. The pattern of IL-10 secretion upon TLR stimulation of macrophages for 24 hr (Supporting Information, Figure 3 ) was similar to that observed for microglia.",

It was interesting to observe that co-stimulation of TLR2-, TLR4-, or TLR9-activated microglia with TLR3 significantly enhanced IL-10 production (Figure 2a-c) .

            "text": "To further understand the molecular events underlying the modulation of IL-10 upon TLR3 co-stimulation of microglia, we focused on the combination TLR2/TLR3. We measured the transcription of the Il10 gene over time in microglia stimulated via TLR2 alone, TLR3 alone or the combination TLR2/TLR3. Consistent with the decreased amounts of IL-10 protein, the transcription of the Il10 gene upon TLR3 stimulation was significantly reduced as compared to that induced by TLR2 activation ( Figure 2d ). This suggested that the signaling downstream TLR3 is not productive in what concerns IL-10 transcription. Co-stimulating microglia with TLR2 and TLR3 did not enhance the amount of Il10 mRNA early poststimulation, when compared with TLR2 stimulation alone ( Figure 2d ). However, whereas upon TLR2 activation a peak of Il10 gene expression was detected at 1 hr poststimulation and progressively decreased during the analyzed 6 hr, upon TLR2/TLR3 activation, the level of IL-10 mRNA peaked at 1 hr and then again at 6 hr poststimulation ( Figure 2d ). This suggested that in the combined stimulation a second wave of Il10 transcription may be occurring, which would justify the higher amounts of IL-10 protein detected in this case. Alternatively, maintenance of the Il10 mRNA could result from increased Il10 mRNA stability, as previously shown for macrophages (Teixeira-Coelho et al., 2014) . To investigate this hypothesis, microglia were stimulated with TLR2 or TLR2/TLR3 and at 1 hr poststimulation actinomycin D was added to the cultures and the IL-10 transcription followed for an extra 90 min. A similar decline in the detection of IL-10 either in single or combined stimulation was observed (Figure 2e) . Therefore, the combination of TLR3 with TLR2 triggering led to enhanced IL-10 transcription, rather than enhanced mRNA stability, thus explaining the higher levels of IL-10 produced by microglia upon TLR2/TLR3 co-stimulation.",

Considering the cytokine landscape obtained upon TLR3 triggering of microglia (Figure 1 ), if such mechanism was operating, the best candidate molecule would be IFN-b, as it is strongly induced by TLR3 ( Figure 1g ) and it has been described to potentiate IL-10 in studies performed with bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells (Iyer, Ghaffari, & Cheng, 2010; F. W. McNab et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, we observed an early transcription of the Ifnb gene downstream of TLR3 signaling in microglia (Figure 3a) , which suggested that IFN-b would be produced early enough to modulate the second Il10 transcriptional wave. Also, in line with the protein data ( Figure 1g ), no Ifnb transcription was observed upon TLR2 stimulation of microglia (Figure 3a) . To test the role of IFN-b in inducing IL-10 in microglia, we generated microglia from WT or IFNAR deficient mice, which do not respond to type I IFNs (IFN-b or IFN-a) . Although IL-10 production in response to single TLR2 or TLR3 stimulation was not affected by the absence of IFNAR, microglia deficient for this receptor failed to upregulate IL-10 production 24 hr poststimulation with TLR2",

These findings are interesting because IL-10 expression in the brain has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for a series of neurological diseases with an immune component, such as MS, Parkinson's disease, and brain injury (Kwilasz et al., 2015) . Furthermore, because IFN-b is currently used in the clinics to treat MS patients, it is tempting to speculate that it may exert its local action by promoting IL-10 secretion. However, in the case of complex diseases such as MS, the immune environment generated in the CNS also comprises T-cell-derived cytokines, notably IFN-g and IL-17. To understand whether the presence of these cytokines would impact on the modulation of IL-10 by TLR3 signaling, we stimulated microglia via TLR2 and TLR3 and combined this with increasing doses of recombinant IL-17 or IFN-g. Interestingly, whereas the IL-17-enriched environment did not alter the modulation of IL-10 secretion by TLR3 (Figure 5a) , the IFNg-enriched milieu totally abrogated it (Figure 5b) . Therefore, the successful modulation of IL-10 production in microglia by TLR3 or IFN-b will clearly depend on the immune composition of the tissue microenvironment, a factor that needs to be taken into account in IL-10-based therapies.",

Pathways for initiating inflammation include an expanding number of cellular sensors, namely the TLR family. Members of this family are expressed on innate immune cells, including microglia cells and astrocytes (Holley et al., 2012; Kawai & Akira, 2010) . Activation of microglia through TLRs, and other PRRs, plays an important role in initiating innate immune responses that protect the CNS from aggressions, such as the presence of pathogens, and that promote tissue regeneration after injury (Okun et al., 2009) . However, cumulative evidence show that persistently activated microglia, and reactive astrocytes, can also contribute to pathogenesis of several types of CNS diseases, such as MS (Goverman, 2011; Okun et al., 2009) . Therefore, microglial cells may contribute to either neuroprotection or neurodegeneration, depending on the setting and the context they are in. Consequently, switching microglial responses toward neuroprotection may be beneficial in different diseases, for example, in MS (Weiner, 2008) .",

            "text": "Several studies addressed the importance of TLRs in MS pathology, showing that the expression of these receptors is increased in brain lesions of both MS and EAE (Bsibsi, Ravid, Gveric, & van Noort, 2002) . Interestingly, whereas activation of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 is detrimental in MS and EAE (Prinz et al., 2006; Visser et al., 2005) , that of TLR3 protects from disease (Gooshe et al., 2014; Touil, Fitzgerald, Zhang, Rostami, & Gran, 2006) . We started this study by looking at the inflammatory landscape of microglia triggered by these TLRs. We found that, overall, TLR3 was the least inflammatory TLR, as only low cytokine levels were detected upon activation of microglia with polyI: C, a TLR3 agonist. This poor reactivity of TLR3 may underlie its protective nature in EAE (Gooshe et al., 2014) . Furthermore, TLR3 triggering led to pronounced IFN-b secretion, a molecule that is currently used to treat MS patients (Plosker, 2011; Trojano et al., 2009 ) and which presence is protective in EAE (Goldmann et al., 2016; Touil et al., 2006) . However, in apparent contrast with these data, we found that another protective cytokine in EAE (Bettelli et al., 1998) , the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, was poorly induced downstream of TLR3. In the context of MS or EAE, tissue inflammation is accompanied by cellular death, which releases several DAMPs and propagates microglia reactivity. It is therefore most likely that several TLRs, and indeed other PRRs, get activated. When TLR3 activation was combined with that of the other tested TLRs, a significant increase on the production of IL-10 FIG URE 5 The cytokine milieu impacts the TLR3-driven enhancement of IL-10. WT microglial cells were stimulated for 24 hr with TLR2 or TLR3 agonists alone or in combination in the absence or presence of increasing doses of (a) IL-17 or (b) IFN-g. Cell culture supernatants were collected and IL-10 production was measured by ELISA. Represented are the mean 6 SD for triplicate wells per condition for two independent experiments. Statistical differences were assessed by student's t test or one-way ANOVA. Significant statistical differences are represented by *** p < .001. bdl, below detection level LOBO-SILVA ET AL. | 1447 was observed. Importantly, this increase of IL-10 production as a result of combined TLR2/TLR3 stimulation of microglia has a functional impact. Indeed, whereas the production of IL-12 downstream of TLR2 or TLR3 stimulation is only mildly increased in IL-10-deficient microglia, it is markedly enhanced in co-stimulated microglia, in the absence of IL-10 (Supporting Information, Figure 4) . Thus, the enhancement of IL-10 in TLR2/TLR3 co-stimulated microglia appears to hamper proinflammatory responses. We narrowed the regulation of IL-10 by TLR3 down to a positive feedback loop involving IFN-b that mechanistically induced a second wave of Il10 gene transcription, but did not affect the stability of the Il10 mRNA. This observation mirrors the effect of IFN-b in innate immune cells of the periphery (Iyer et al., 2010; McNab et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) , supporting the existence of transversal mechanisms operating in circulating versus resident macrophages, such as microglia. We herein also show that the production of IL-10 by TLRactivated microglia follows a pattern similar to that observed in conventional macrophages derived from the bone marrow. TLR3 is the sole TLR signaling only via the TRIF pathway (Kawai & Akira, 2010) , which has been previously involved in sustaining the stability of the Il10 mRNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Teixeira-Coelho et al., 2014) . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that cell-specific mechanisms are also in place, to ensure specificity in the regulation of IL-10.",

In EAE, lack of endogenous IFN-b in the CNS leads to augmented microglia activation, resulting in a sustained inflammation, cytokine production, and tissue damage with consequent chronic neurological deficits (Teige et al., 2003) in support of an anti-inflammatory role for this molecule. Furthermore, expression of IFN-b within the CNS (Khorooshi et al., 2015) , including in microglia (Kocur et al., 2015) , plays a protective role in EAE.

At least in microglia, these events seem to be unrelated, with the IFN-b potentiation of IL-10 being independent of IL-27. This is in line with other studies performed in macrophages (McNab et al., 2014) and contrasts with a possible role of IL-27 in promoting IL-10 production by myeloid cells (Iyer et al., 2010) and effector Th cells (Freitas do Rosario et al., 2012) . As mentioned above, the response to IFN-b therapy in MS has been correlated with an inhibition of Th17 cells (Krakauer et al., 2008; Kvarnstrom et al., 2013; Ramgolam et al., 2009; Sweeney et al., 2011) . As herein shown, the direct effect of IFNb in potentiating IL-10 secretion by TLR-activated microglia would still occur in the context of IL-17, but would be largely compromised in the presence of IFN-g. The role of IFN-g in modulating IL-10 production by microglia is still not fully understood, but it is likely dependent on the activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 (Green & Nolan, 2012) . It is interesting to note that low amounts of IFN-g were detected upon stimulation of the microglia cultures with TLR2, 4, and 9",

The fact that absence of IFN-g under TLR3 stimulation did not license IL-10 production fits with the mechanism we propose, where low IL-10 triggering in response to TLR3 stimulation is related to deficient basic transcriptional activity. In further support of an independent endogenous IFN-g vs IL-10 production, blocking of IFN-g with a neutralizing antibody did not alter IL-10 secretion by TLR2-stimulated microglia (Supporting Information, Figure 5 ). In sum, by using an in vitro model of neonate microglia activation, our study illustrates the complexity of the events regulating microglial responses, providing hints to possible mechanisms operating in the adult brain in the context of EAE. It will be important to now probe these mechanisms in vivo, by resorting to various genetically modified mice and to also address the effects of microglia modulation on adjacent cells, notably on neurons.",

These differences were related to a differential induction of IFN-b in either background (Howes et al., 2016) . If the same differences apply to microglia, the use of either mouse strain to induce EAE may lead to distinct results. In line with a possible impact of the mouse genetic background in the response of microglia to TLR activation, previous studies reported IFN-b production downstream of TLR9 activation in microglia generated from IRW mice (Butchi et al., 2010) . This was not the case in our study, where C57BL/6 mice were used (Figure 1d ).",
