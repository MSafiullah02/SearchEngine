Data from International Registries indicate that more than 25,000 transplants are performed every year in Europe, and a similar number in the United States (US) (Copelan 2006; Gratwohl et al. 2007 ). The objectives of this procedure are: (1) to replace hematopoiesis affected by a severe and irreversible disorder, (2) to rescue the patient from intense marrow toxicity induced by high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation, and (3) to use a fraction of cells contained in the graft as anti-tumor immunotherapy. Of note, one or more of these objectives may be pursued in a particular situation; for example, in a patient with acute leukemia, transplantation aims to replace the neoplastic hematopoiesis by administering high-dose cytotoxic therapy and taking advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor T-lymphocytes from the graft. In contrast, in aplastic anemia the only goal of the procedure is to restore an adequate hematopoiesis.",

The results encouraged this group to investigate this approach in earlier phases of disease evolution.

In those days it became evident that large numbers of hematopoietic progenitors could be obtained from peripheral blood during the recovery phase following chemotherapy. The introduction of colonystimulating factors (CSF) in clinical practice led to the same observation: these agents were able to mobilize large amounts of hematopoietic progenitor cells to peripheral blood. Of note, the combination of chemotherapy and CSF increased the harvestable cells by means of apheresis devices compared with either alone. In autologous transplants, peripheral blood rapidly replaced bone marrow as the source of hematopoietic progenitors. In contrast, in allogeneic procedures the introduction of peripheral blood was slower. The reason was the particular concern that GVHD could be very frequent and severe, since peripheral blood contains 10 times more T-lymphocytes than bone marrow. However, this drawback was not confi rmed by clinical experience and since 1995 the proportion of peripheral blood transplants has progressively increased, accounting now for more than 70% of allogeneic procedures.",

Patients with lymphoma, myeloma, acute leukemia or myelodysplasia may benefi t from this procedure, among others. Hematopoietic transplantation is also useful for replacing insuffi cient or defective cells derived from the marrow progenitors. This is the case in patients with marrow aplasia, central cytopenias, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, marrow myelofi brosis or inherited disorders of metabolism. Depending on the disease and degree of marrow involvement, patients will be suitable for allogeneic, autologous transplantation, or both. Of note, progress in non-transplant therapies is limiting some classical indications for this procedure. A good example of this is chronic myelogenous leukemia, where the introduction of imatinib, a bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has dramatically decreased the number of transplants for this disease (Baccarani et al. 2006 ). On the other hand, studies showing no superiority of autologous transplantation over conventional treatment in patients with breast cancer mean that the former is almost never used now.",

The usual dose of granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) is 10 \u00b5g/kg daily if used alone and 5 \u00b5g/kg when combined with chemotherapy. This chemotherapy may be the patient's standard treatment or consist of a single high dose of cyclophosphamide (1-3 g IV). In chemotherapyplus-CSF mobilization, peripheral blood stem cell collection usually begins on day 11-14 after the start of treatment, whereas in CSF priming alone harvesting is initiated on day 4 or 5 of therapy. In most instances, one to four apheresis sessions are required to obtain at least 2\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg, the adequate number of cells for transplantation. In autologous collection from heavily pretreated patients it is relatively frequent to observe a low Patient number of circulating CD34+ cells during the mobilization attempt. This circumstance is known as mobilization failure. Collection of cord blood stem cells consists of canalization of the umbilical vein after delivery to obtain, by gravidity and pressure on the placenta, 100-150 ml of blood. An adequate cord blood unit for transplantation contains at least 5\u00d710 6 total CD34+ cells. The infused cell dose has to be at least 1\u00d710 5 CD34 cells/kg or 2\u00d710 7 nucleated cells (NC)/kg. All cell products for transplantation have to be bacteriologically and virologically tested. In autologous and in cord blood transplantation the cells collected are cryopreserved and stored for future use.",

Differences in tissue attenuation and parenchymal changes caused by an acute infl ammatory process can be seen readily by CT. Unlike chest radiography, CT provides cross-sectional images and the pattern and distribution of pulmonary processes are therefore much more readily appreci-ated than on conventional examinations. The fi ndings of air-space disease, air-space (acinar) nodules, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, air bronchograms, and centrilobular or perilobular distribution are seen better by CT than by conventional radiography. Air-space nodules represent the size of the acinus (6-10 mm) and are centrilobular in distribution. They are best appreciated in early disease and best seen at the edge of the pathologic process where consolidation is incomplete.",

There has been a substantial increase in the number of patients at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis for many reasons, including the development of new intensive chemotherapy regimens for solid tumors, diffi cult-to-treat lymphoma, myeloma, and resistant leukemia as well as an increase in the number of solid organ transplantations and increased use of immunosuppressive regimens for other autoimmune diseases. Angioinvasive aspergillosis is the most common fungal pulmonary infection in severe neutropenic patients. It is much more common in allogeneic than in autologous HCT recipients and in patients with acute leukemia (Denning 2000; Fukuda et al. 2004 ). The diagnosis of angioinvasive aspergillosis is based on clinical, radiological, and mycological data. Although a febrile neutropenic patient with pulmonary infi ltrates should be evaluated for aspergillosis, a conclusive diagnosis of angioinvasive aspergillosis is seldom straightforward and remains a signifi cant clinical problem. Disseminated aspergillosis occurs in up to 60% of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis; sites of involvement include the brain, kidney, liver, thyroid, heart, and spleen.",

Histoplasmosis is rare, but often a life-threatening infection in patients with AIDS and hematologic malignancies. Most cases of disseminated histoplasmosis occur either as a result of new infection after an environmental exposure or as a result of reactivation of a remote infection (Conces et al. 1993; Kauffman 2002) . The radiographic fi ndings of disseminated histoplasmosis are varied and non-specifi c; approximately 40% of patients with pulmonary disseminated histoplasmosis have a normal chest radiograph (Conces et al. 1993) . CT can be helpful in the assessment of patients who have symptoms of pulmonary disease and normal or non-specifi c radiographic fi ndings. The most common radiographic fi ndings are diffuse nodular opacities 3 mm or less in diameter, nodules greater than 3 mm in diameter, small linear opacities, and focal or patchy areas of consolidation (McAdams et al. 1995) .",

Factors that predispose bone marrow transplant recipients to Candida infections include allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, increased age, and a prolonged neutropenia ( Verfaillie et al. 1991) .

Pathologically, areas of consolidation represent areas of bronchopneumonia, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, exudates, and hyaline membranes.

Thus, the diagnosis of IPS is one of exclusion, which requires the elimination of potential infectious agents as a cause of the patient's respiratory status. Idiopathic pneumonia is the most common cause of diffuse radiographic abnormalities between 30 days and 180 days after HSC transplantation. Clinical symptoms include dyspnea, cough, and fever. The mortality rate of IPS remains greater than 70%, and two-thirds of all deaths are associated with progressive respiratory failure (Kantrow et al. 1997) . The histologic features of IPS range from a primarily interstitial reaction with diffuse or focal widening of the alveolar septa and interstitial spaces by mononuclear infl ammatory cells and edema to diffuse alveolar damage with intra-alveolar hyaline membranes, edema, and hemorrhage. Other associated patterns such as organizing pneumonia and vascular damage have also been described. The pathologic fi ndings of IPS are similar to those found in acute interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can be separated into acute exudative, subacute proliferative, and chronic fi brotic phases. Characteristic CT fi ndings include focal or diffuse ground-glass opacity and air-space consolidation with a basilar predominance (Fig. 6.2.12) , a pattern consistent with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (Kantrow et al. 1997) . Pleural effusions may be present. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and the presence of honeycombing are indicative of the fi brotic phase of IPS. ",

(With permission from In these patients, air in the peribronchial sheets (pulmonary interstitial emphysema) can be associated with impairment of respiratory function and/or chest pain, possibly resulting from compression of small vessels by the interstitial air. In most patients, pulmonary interstitial emphysema is transient and it is well known that this process is diffi cult, if not impossible, to detect by chest radiograph. Chest CT should be performed in any HSC transplant recipient with known or suspected cGVHD who present with acute clinical symptoms, especially chest pain, to rule out associated air-leak syndromes. Therefore, suspicion of BO should be high and prompt therapy should be initiated in long-term HSC transplant recipients presenting with spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema (Franquet et al. 2007 ).",
