            "text": "Acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in piglets. Group A rotaviruses (PRV-A), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are recognized as the principal viruses causing gastroenteritis in piglets. PEDV and TGEV are members of the Coronaviridae family and cause watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in suckling pigs. Rotaviruses, members of the Reoviridae family, are the most common cause of porcine gastroenteritis. The TGEV, PEDV, and PRV-A infections are difficult to differentiate clinically (Cavanagh, 1997, Pensaert, 1999, Saif and Wesley, 1999); these viruses cause enteritis in swine of all ages, and are fatal frequently in neonatal piglets, resulting in serious economic loss. They induce similar clinical signs and lesions: destroy villous enterocytes and cause villous atrophy in the small intestine, resulting in profuse diarrhea and vomiting. Hence, it is important to develop an effective and rapid method for their differential detection (Rod\u00e1k et al., 2004). The development of duplex RT-PCR, either classical or quantitative, for the detection of porcine enteric viruses has been described by many investigators (Kim et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2001, Kim et al., 2007, Jung and Chae, 2005). Although these methods may contribute to differential detection of two given viruses, some of these methods depend on the laboratory facilities. Furthermore, real time PCR is a cost-effective assay for routine research. Song et al. (2006) described the development of a multiplex RT-PCR for rapid differential detection of PEDV, TGEV, and PRV-A using pairs of specific primers published previously (Kim et al., 2001, Elschner et al., 2002) which may be useful for routine diagnosis.",

Unlike TGEV, PRCV causes a respiratory tract infection with clinical or sub-clinical (pathological changes in the respiratory tract without any clear clinical signs) manifestations, with minimal or no intestinal replication. As a result of the high homology between the two virus genome sequences, the deletion region of the S gene of TGEV, which is absent in the PRCV genome, was targeted in this study. The M gene was used as a suitable target for the development of specific primers for the detection of PEDV. The nucleotide sequences of all the eleven genome segments of PRV-A were analyzed. The NSP5 gene, which is the most conservative gene among PRV-A strains and isolates, was therefore used for the development of group-specific primers.",

To this RNA solution, a mixture of reagents consisting of 5 \u03bcL of AMV 5\u00d7 buffer (Promega, Washington, USA) (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2); 1 mM of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania); 10 \u03bcM of each primer S1, S2, P1, P2, M1, and M2; 1.25 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Washington, USA); and bidistilled water was added to make up a total volume of 25 \u03bcL. The mixture was incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 40 min. The cDNA (DNA copy) was either stored at \u221220 \u00b0C or amplified immediately. Two PCR assays were carried out. The first PCR (cDNA amplification) was carried out using primers S1, S2, P1, P2, M1, and M2. The second PCR (re-amplification step) was a nested PCR and conducted using the internal primers S3, S4, P3, P4, M3, and M4 (Sintol, Moscow, Russia). The PCR mixture contained 2.5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 Taq DNA polymerase buffer (SibEnzyme Ltd, Novosibirsk, Russia); 3 mM of MgCl2; 200 \u03bcM each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP; 5 \u03bcM of each primer; and 1.25 \u03bcL of Taq DNA polymerase (SibEnzyme Ltd, Novosibirsk, Russia). Deionized water was added to make up a total volume of 25 \u03bcL. The amplification step was carried out using the following thermal cycles: the denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 4 min was followed by 40 cycles of the amplification step (denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min), a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min, and then the tubes were held at +4 \u00b0C. The product of the first reaction (2 \u03bcL) was used as a template for the reaction of the re-amplification, which was carried out using the following thermal cycles: the denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of the amplification step (denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min), a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel in TBE (Tris\u2013boric acid\u2013EDTA) buffer, stained by ethidium bromide (Sigma, NY, USA). The product of the RT-PCRR was visualized using a UV transilluminator. Gel images were recorded digitally with the Gel Doc 2000 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, NY, USA) (Fig. 1\n).

To determine the detection limit of the nested RT-PCR assay, 10-fold serial dilutions of PEDV isolate from the first passage were used.

The use of an immunochromatographic test strip such as the Anigen Rapid Virus Ag Test kit (ANIGEN Rapid PED Ag Test Kit, Catalogue No. RG14-01; ANIGEN Rapid TGE Ag Test Kit, Catalogue No. RG14-02; and ANIGEN Rapid Rota Ag Test Kit, Catalogue No. RG18-03; Animal Genetics Inc.; South Korea) can be used as a rapid method for the detection of gastroenteritis infections in farms and in the laboratory but the results need to be confirmed and characterized further by RT-PCR and other available methods depending on the laboratory facilities. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified fragment of the PEDV M gene showed three nucleotide substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis classified the PEDV isolates detected in one cluster (cluster A). According to the results of this study these substitutions can be considered as biomarkers for Russian PEDV isolates but this approach needs to be investigated further. Coronaviruses adapt rapidly to changing ecological circumstances by the high mutation rate of their RNA genome (about 104\n nucleotide substitution/site/year) and the high recombination frequencies (Sanchez et al., 1992). The genetic variability and the emergence of new coronavirus strains which can infect new host species and cause emerging diseases with or without possible zoonotic risk are not rare phenomena as was shown for other human and animal coronaviruses (TGEV and the attenuated strain PRCV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), human coronavirus OC43, and bovine coronavirus) (Vijgen et al., 2005). In addition, the genomes of canine and feline coronaviruses can recombine in vivo and develop into different biotypes that are transmissible serially in a new host species (Herrewegh et al., 1998).",
