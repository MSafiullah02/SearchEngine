            "text": "About two-thirds of the human brain is involved in processing visual information. Each eye has about 100 million photoreceptors (Fig. 20.1\n, top row). The flow of information starts with the conversion of photons to an analogue signal in the retinal photoreceptors, and this is then converted by the bipolar cells of the inner nuclear layer (Fig. 20.1, third row) into a digital signal coding for approximately 12 parallel information streams (Masland, 2012). This represents the first stage in the parallel analysis of the many submodalities of the visual image (contrast, motion, color, etc.). The size of retinal ganglion cells is minuscule \u2013 about 1% of the volume of a pyramidal cell in the hippocampus or cortex (Masland, 2012). Each retinal ganglion cell generates the visual signal along a \u201chard-wired\u201d pathway to the primary visual cortex, also known as striate cortex or V1 (Balk et al., 2015). This \u201chard-wired\u201d pathway is the anatomic basis of what is known as the retinotopic (point-to-point) projection of the retina, and hence the basis for the visual field in the visual cortex (Table 20.1\n) (Holmes, 1945). There are also less numerous, but nonetheless significant, projections to other visual cortical areas (such as V5 involved in motion processing) and the tectum (involved in pupillary reflexes). There is, therefore, an ample substrate for differential effects of immune processes on parallel pathways of processing within a single anatomically defined structure such as the retina, optic nerve, or visual cortex. Selective deficits of color vision, motion perception, and other modalities are all potential manifestations of autoimmune-mediated dysfunction.",

The axons of the optic nerve partially decussate (50% project contralaterally) in the chiasm. The retinal ganglion cell is the first-order neuron and synapses with the second-order neuron in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, where visual processing continues (Prasad and Galetta, 2011). Finally, the retinotopic projections from these second-order neurons result in a retinotopic map and functional architecture of V1 (Hubel and Wiesel, 1977). The visual pathways projecting from the retina to V1 are shown in Figure 20.2\n. The primary visual cortex itself is an early stage of cortical visual processing (Tong, 2003). Beyond V1 are multiple extrastriate visual areas which are involved in further information processing (Sincich and Horton, 2005, Barton, 2011).",

At the same time, the seductive beauty of this fine anatomic network depends on visual information processing involving receptors, ion channels, and second-messenger cascades (Sterling, 1999); the receptors and voltage-gated channels with their extracellular domains are also potential targets for autoimmunity.",

All forms of hyperacuity (such as Vernier acuity) rely on visual cortical function.

For example, some cases of nonembolic transient monocular blindness could be due to a channelopathy (Petzold et al., 2013a, Petzold et al., 2013b), as might paroxysmal symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), including deterioration in vision with rise in body temperature (Uhthoff phenomenon) (Petzold et al., 2014). The potassium channel Kir4.1 (also known as Kcnj10), which resides in the astrocytes, is one of the most recent candidates for a possible autoimmune channelopathy affecting the visual system in MS (Srivastava et al., 2012). This potassium channel is highly expressed in optic nerve and the M\u00fcller cells of the retina. However, it has not yet been possible to replicate the findings of antibodies to Kir4.1 in MS (Brickshawana et al., 2014). For this and for most of the other antibodies described below, the gold standard has become detection of antibodies binding to the protein in its natural environment on the surface of human cells. This issue is discussed in detail in Chapter 9.",

The typical clinical presentation is that of periorbital pain, which occurs only or is exacerbated by eye movement and precedes visual loss. Positive visual symptoms may be present at onset; negative visual symptoms reach their nadir within about 2 weeks and have recovered substantially by about 3 months. Residual symptoms include dyschromatopsia, impaired contrast sensitivity, Uhthoff phenomenon, Pulfrich phenomenon, visual fading, and glare disability (Table 20.3\n) (Petzold et al., 2014).",

Consistent with findings in MS and experimental models of MS, a number of autoantibodies against myelin proteins have been reported in MSON (Petzold, 2013). These are myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein, and myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein. There is no evidence to suggest an association between paraneoplastic antibodies and MSON (Stich et al., 2011). However, a common limitation of these studies is the assumption that optic neuritis was due to MS but the clinical data are missing (Petzold et al., 2014) and, as more data regarding antibodies emerge, particularly antibodies to MOG in relapsing and bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis, the position may change.",

Following complement-mediated damage to astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein, a specific astrocyte protein, is released into the extracellular fluid and CSF, providing an additional test that may be helpful in some cases (Petzold, 2015).

This was followed by pain on eye movements and visual loss in the left eye within 3 weeks. Active inflammation of the optic nerve was documented by MRI elsewhere (Fig. 20.7A). The patient was referred to our center, where bilateral pale optic discs were noted. During follow-up another episode of acute optic neuritis developed in the right eye. Again this was preceded by pain on eye movements and documented on MRI (Fig. 20.7B); immunosuppressive treatment was initiated and the situation had stabilized at 18-month follow-up. There was severe bilateral optic atrophy with an average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of 59 \u03bcm on the right and 64 \u03bcm on the left (Fig. 20.7C).",

Eleven cases have been reported in the literature (Cinefro and Frenkel, 1978, Deutsch and Corwin, 1988, Eckstein et al., 1995, Frigui et al., 2011); mild optic disc swelling was reported in 9/11 (82%). All patients were treated with corticosteroids and visual recovery was moderate to complete (Frigui et al., 2011). Focal vascular occlusive events involving the ciliary vasculature were suggested as an alternative differential diagnosis (Frigui et al., 2011). Optic chiasmitis associated with SLE has also been reported (Frohman et al., 2001). However, all but one of these studies (Frigui et al., 2011) predated the discovery of AQP4 autoantibodies, and the 2 patients from Frigui et al. did not appear to have been tested. This is important because there is an overlap between SLE and NMO, estimated to be 2\u20135% (Pittock et al., 2008, Jarius et al., 2012). Patients with SLE and optic neuritis or transverse myelitis should be tested for AQP4 autoantibodies (Petzold et al., 2014). It is possible that nonvascular-based damage to the optic nerves in SLE may be caused by such an overlap of autoimmunity.",

The pattern of visual field defects was heterogeneous, perceived as black, blurring, gray, or spotted (Donders et al., 1998), as is common in nonembolic transient monocular blindness (Petzold et al., 2013b). The differential diagnosis of transient monocular blindness in SLE includes secondary retinal vasospasm (Table 2 in Petzold et al., 2013a) and emboli (Giorgi et al., 2001). SLE can also present as pseudotumor cerebri, which can affect visual function as a result of the attendant papilledema (Deschler et al., 2010).

The authors hypothesized that toxic properties of the chosen chemotherapy (vincristine) were the cause (Ripps et al., 1984). Generally, Gass is credited with recognizing the melanoma-associated retinopathy syndrome (Gass, 1984, Berson and Lessell, 1988). The typical clinical presentation is with night blindness, frequently associated with photopsia, which can have a shimmering border (Braithwaite et al., 2014). In contrast to cancer-associated retinopathy, there is no, or only very slow, progression. This makes the differential diagnosis to other retinal disorders such as acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) more challenging. There are, however, less likely to be discrete scotomata in melanoma-associated retinopathy as are found in AZOOR. Perimetry can be unreliable in melanoma-associated retinopathy because the constant photopsia occur throughout the visual field and mimic the target in automated perimetry. In AZOOR the photopsias tend to be restricted to the scotomata.",

However, at the time of writing there are no validated diagnostic antibodies (Braithwaite et al., 2014). Suggested candidate autoantibodies target two isoforms of the fructose biphosphate aldolase (aldoalse A and C) (Lu et al., 2009).

At the level of the RPE, en face OCT shows dark spots which correspond to hyperfluorescence spots on the blue-light autofluorescence (Jansen et al., 2015). The visual symptoms can precede discovery of the primary tumor. Miles et al. (2012) suggested the presence of an antibody that induced melanocyte proliferation.

The typical clinical presentation of AZOOR is that of a uniocular circumscribed visual field defect with positive symptoms predominantly at the outer border of the defect (Gass et al., 2002). The border region appears brighter on blue autofluorescence. Electrodiagnostic tests and OCT support the diagnosis and confirm outer retinal (photoreceptor) dysfunction. A considerable proportion of patients with AZOOR have concomitant autoimmune disease (Gass et al., 2002, Heckenlively and Ferreyra, 2008). There is ongoing research to identify candidate retinal autoantibodies for future clinical and laboratory validation studies. There is no evidence base for treatment, although corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed in the acute phase. Some localized forms of retinitis are named according to the part of the retina affected \u2013 if peripapillary, then the \u201cidiopathic big blind spot syndrome,\u201d and if paramacular, \u201cmacular neuroretinitis.\u201d How these conditions relate to AZOOR is uncertain, but OCT confirms similar location of the pathology. Idiopathic big blind spot syndrome tends to be uniocular and macular neuroretinitis tends to be binocular. Positive symptoms localized to the scotomata are characteristic of this group of conditions.",
