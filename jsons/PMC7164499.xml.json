            "text": "Respiratory function can be understood as a series of interactive biomechanical processes involving the structural elements of the lung, particularly the airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) playing a decisive role in regulation of pulmonary airway impedance. From the microscopic viewpoint, the cytoskeletal structure of ASMCs is a highly complex and dynamic system with specific micro/nanodynamic characteristics. In addition, the morphology and phenotypic transformation of ASMCs are affected by mechanical factors in the external microenvironment [1\u20135]. This inspires researchers to focus on the cellular biomechanics of ASMCs in the study of obstructive airway disease such as asthma. For example, previous study has shown that the biomechanical behavior of ASMCs can be altered by localized external stress stimulation, which may directly contribute to excessive ASMC contraction and thus airway stenosis associated with asthma [6]. As ASM dynamics is considered as the common final pathway of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that is characteristic of asthma, ASMC biomechanics may be a key to the understanding of the underlying mechanism of AHR and the pathogenesis of asthma.",

For example, it has been shown that the expression of IL-17A is elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues from both allergen-induced asthmatic mice and patients with asthma in correlation with severity of the disease [7\u20139]. In addition, it is known that IL-17A can directly bind to the IL-17RA/RC receptor expressed on ASMCs to induce AHR at the tissue level [10], but the effect of IL-17A on ASMC contractility has not been evaluated at the cellular level.",

            "text": "For clinical treatment of asthma, the current therapy mainly uses glucocorticoids and \u03b22 adrenergic receptor agonists to inhibit airway inflammation and dilate bronchial airways, respectively. However, these drugs are known for adverse side effects, in particular about half asthmatic patients are not responsive to them, and many become desensitized after long-term use of \u03b22 agonist treatment [11]. Therefore, there is a need to develop new bronchodilator drugs for the treatment of asthma. An approach is to screen potential drug agent from natural materials such as herbs used in traditional medicine. Accordingly, pharmacopeia records suggest that natural plant rhizome Dioscorea nipponicae has antitussive, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory effects, and its active ingredient is saponins of Dioscorea nipponicae (SDN). Previous study has demonstrated that SDN can reduce airway tissue remodeling by inhibiting IL-17A in murine model of chronic asthma [12]. Since airway remodeling mainly manifests as structural changes of ASMCs including hyperplasia and hypertrophy that contribute to irreversible airflow obstruction and persistent AHR, SDN appears to be an effective agent to alleviate AHR through regulation of IL-17A-mediated human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) structural changes [13]. It is not clear, however, whether SDN could affect HASMCs' biomechanical behaviors through mediation of IL-17A as a therapeutic agent for treating AHR.",

To test this hypothesis, we aimed to evaluate the changes of biomechanical behaviors including stiffness, contraction force, and mobility of ASMCs cultured in vitro in the absence or presence of IL-17A followed by SDN treatment. Such investigation may not only reveal how IL-17A mediates airway contractile function at the cell level but also provide first evidence to demonstrate the potential of SDN as a novel bronchodilator drug agent for treating AHR in asthma.",

As shown in Fig. 2, IL-17A treatment did result in a dose- and time-dependent change in cell stiffness of HASMCs (Gp/Gp(0), where Gp(0) was the baseline cell stiffness prior to drug treatment). There was a statistically significant increase in cell stiffness when the IL-17A concentration reached 0.1 ng/mL (*P < 0.05) or 10 to 1000 ng/mL (**P < 0.01) compared with the control group (0 ng/mL), and the cell stiffness increased more than 50% at 10 ng/mL (Fig. 2(a)). Therefore, in the following experiments, we treated HASMCs with IL-17A only at 10 ng/mL. When treated at this concentration over time, the cell stiffness increased significantly at 12 h (*P < 0.05), then further increased by more than 50% at 24 h (**P < 0.01), and almost reached plateau afterwards (Fig. 2(b)).

This stereoscopic arrangement ensures that the contractile tension is evenly distributed from the cell to the extracellular matrix. After treatment with IL-17A, the intensity of stress fibers increased significantly (Fig. 4(e)), which could in turn cause change in cell contractility. After treatment with SDN, IL-17A-induced increase of intracellular stress fibers was alleviated and diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, and the geometric arrangement of cells was changed back (Fig. 4(f)).

Therefore, it is important to evaluate changes in mechanical properties of ASMCs in relation to pathogenesis as well as treatment of AHR airway diseases such as asthma. The two important indexes of cell mechanical properties are the stiffness and the traction force, which were used to quantify the changes of mechanical properties of ASMCs under the action of IL-17A and SDN in this study. According to the results of cell stiffness measured by OMTC and the cell traction force measured by FTTM, IL-17A treatment could increase the stiffness and traction force of the HASMCs, but subsequent SDN treatment could reverse these changes in a dose-dependent manner. It has been shown before that the IL-17RA/RC receptor subtypes are expressed on bronchial airway smooth muscle, and IL-17A binding can induce the enhancement of the contraction response of smooth muscle ring tissue, which plays an important role in the underlying mechanism of AHR [10,21]. The key finding of this study is that SDN could inhibit the effect of IL-17A on the mechanical properties of ASMCs, suggesting that SDN may be a potential drug agent for treatment of IL-17A-mediated AHR. Although IL-17A is a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine and SDN is a natural product that has long been widely used in traditional medicine for anti-inflammatory purposes, it is the first evidence, to our best knowledge, to show that SDN could counteract IL-17A in regulation of the mechanical behaviors of ASMCs. Such a novel function of SDN to relax contracted HASMCs and its well-known function in inhibition of airway inflammation may be complementary to each other in asthma therapy to result in greater efficacy.",

The observation that IL-17A promoted proliferation of the HASMCs is consistent with the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inducting ASMC proliferation that leads to greater ASM mass and thus stronger bronchial response to stimuli and exacerbated AHR [22]. As specific to asthma pathogenesis, studies have shown that ASMCs from asthmatic patients proliferate much faster than their nonasthmatic counterparts [23,24]. On the other hand, it has been shown that enhanced migration of ASMCs, particularly the directional migration toward the airway intima induced by various cytokines, inflammatory mediators and growth factors, is equally important in contributing to greater ASM mass and AHR in asthma [25].",

In particular, the reorganization of cytoskeletal microfilaments has been confirmed as the basis of contractile responses in airway smooth muscle in AHR [27\u201329]. Our results showed that IL-17A had an obvious effect on the formation and remodeling of F-actin in HASMCs, showing increased F-actin intensity in the presence of the cytokine. However, all the IL-17A-induced changes of F-actin structures in the HASMCs were found to be alleviated by SDN under the given conditions of drug treatment. These results further demonstrate that SDN indeed reduced cell stiffness and traction force of the HASMCs by inhibiting the reorganization of F-actin structures induced by IL-17A, but it remains to be confirmed whether SDN actually acted on HASMCs by specifically antagonizing the IL-17A receptor.",

These changes may all contribute to the excessive contractile function of ASMCs manifested as the characteristic AHR in asthma. However, we found that SDN could alleviate all the IL-17A-mediated changes in HASMCs, particularly the changes of biomechanical behaviors such as cell stiffness and traction force generation, as well as the cytoskeletal organization such as F-actin stress fiber formation, suggesting that SDN may be a potential drug candidate as bronchodilator for treating IL-17A-associated AHR.",
