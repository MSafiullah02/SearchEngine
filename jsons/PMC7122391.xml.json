            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is one of five species of viruses that are under clinical evaluation as vectors for oncolytic cancer therapy, for gene therapy, and for immune stimulation (1\u20133). The concept of using viruses to treat human cancer dates back to the early 1900s. The rationale receives support from well-documented remissions of malignancies induced by natural viral infections (measles and mumps or upon vaccination with attenuated viral vaccines) (4\u20137). These observations stimulated a transient peak of research activity in the 1960s and 1970s and received a new interest in the 1980s and 1990s on the basis on new preclinical and clinical (7\u201314) results. Among all the viruses used, RNA viruses are rapidly emerging as particularly promising agents for virus therapy of cancer (15). Integral to the live cycle of all RNA viruses is the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which activates a spectrum of cellular defence mechanisms involving type I interferons: interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Tumors provide a relatively permissive substrate for the propagation of RNA viruses because mutations in tumor cells often cripple the interferon system to allow uninhibited proliferation and to provide resistance to apoptosis (16). The most promising RNA viruses are attenuated strains of mumps virus, NDV, measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, human reovirus, poliovirus, and influenza virus (17). Although human RNA viruses had the ability during evolution to adapt to the human immune system and to develop immune escape mechanisms, the advantage of NDV is that it is a bird virus that has adapted only to the avian immune system (18, 19).",

            "text": "The virus name comes from the site of the first reported disease outbreak among chickens, at a farm near Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England in 1926 (20, 21). NDV is now classified as an avian paramyxovirus (APMV)-1 in the Rubulavirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae in the order Mononegaviralis (22). NDV is an enveloped virus of 100- to 300-nm diameter with a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome of roughly 16,000 nucleotides. These code for six genes encoding six major polypeptides: the large protein (L, 200 kDa), the hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase protein (HN, 74 kDa); the fusion protein (F, 67 kDa); the matrix protein (M, 40 kDa); the phosphoprotein (P, 53 kDa); and the nucleoprotein (NP, 55 kDa). By means of an overlapping reading frame, the P gene encodes for an additional gene product, the V protein. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involves the proteins L, P, and NP, which are translated in infected cells at free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The F glycoprotein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (F0, 67 kDa), which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield the biologically active protein consisting of the disulfide-linked chains F1 (55 kDa) and F2 (12.5 kDa) (for more details about the classification and the structure of NDV, see ref.\n23).",

In 1964, Wheelock and Dingle reported a significant reduction in leukemic blasts in a patient with myelogenous leukemia treated by intravenous (i.v.) administration of NDV (24). In 1965, Cassel and Garrett reported the effects of intratumoral NDV treatment of a patient with cervical cancer (25). Marked tumor shrinkage of the injected mass as well as the supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was observed and the patient tolerated the treatment well. In 1971, Csatary noted that a chicken farmer, shortly after a known exposure to NDV from his flock of infected chickens, had a spontaneous remission of his metastatic cancer (26). In the same report, he noted tumor regression in three other patients, all of whom were intentionally inoculated with NDV. Since this time, a certain number of clinical studies using this virus for cancer therapy have been performed (27). NDV has been labeled as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the USA. More detailed information can be found at the home page of the NCI (28).",

The first step involves the binding of the virus to a host cell\u2019s surface via the cell-binding domain of the HN molecule. This is followed by the activation of the fusion protein F. The concerted action of HN and F leads to fusion of the viral and the host cell membrane. This membrane fusion event allows the viral genome to enter the cytoplasm of the host cell. There, the negative-stranded RNA genome is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and translated to viral proteins (first step). The proteins NP, P, and L are required for nucleocapsid assembly. The nucleocapsid as \u201cantigenome\u201d is then used as a template for viral replication (second step). The M protein and the envelope proteins HN and F, after posttranslational modification, move to the membrane, where virus assembly and budding occurs (33, 34). In this process, single copies of the NDV genome become wrapped into an outer coat envelope that is made from host cells\u2019 plasma membrane. Efficient replication has been observed to be dependent on the genome length being a multiple of six. This requirement is known as the \u201crule of six\u201d (35). It is assumed that each NP subunit is in contact with exactly six nucleotides and that this arrangement is required for efficient replication (36).\n",

Activation of the fusion protein F occurs through interaction of the viral glycoproteins with the sialic acid-containing cellular receptors such as gangliosides and N-glycoproteins, which are ubiquitously expressed on cell surfaces (38\u201340).(ii))\nVia receptor-mediated endocytosis (41).

Certain NDV strains can replicate up to 10,000 times better in human neoplastically transformed cells than in most normal human cells (30). This appears to be the basis of the widely accepted fact that the virus is virtually nontoxic in human and for the interest in its use as a form of cancer therapy. Most remarkable is the strong capacity of NDV to induce type I interferon responses by viral protein and RNA (44) (Fig.\n3). Viral RNA replication induces in infected cells an innate antiviral program that initiates the transcription of RNA-responsive genes. The responses involve a multimodal machinery of gene regulation by the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors (45). NDV stimulates, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), interferon-induced genes (ISG) such as the antiviral enzymes protein kinase R (PKR), a dsRNA-responsive protein kinase; MxA, a dynamin-like GTPase with antiviral activity; and RNaseL (46\u201348). The latter was recently shown to generate small self-RNA, thereby further amplifying antiviral innate immunity (49).\n\n",

The analysis revealed several defects of tumor cells in their antiviral defence responses: they showed no response to UV-inactivated NDV, whereas nontumorigenic cells reacted with induction of high levels of the antiviral enzymes PKR and MxA (47). We conclude that the induction of an early and efficient antiviral response in nontumorigenic cells could explain the stop of the replication cycle of NDV after the production of positive-strand RNA (47). In contrast, the tumor cells show a weak and delayed antiviral response (47, see\nFig.\n2). This observation may explain the continuation of the replication cycle, which leads to high expression of the viral proteins (47).",

Both lytic strains and non-lytic strains replicate much more efficiently in human neoplastic cells than they do in most normal human cells. Viruses of both strain types have been investigated as potential anticancer agents. One major difference between lytic and non-lytic strains is that lytic strains are able to make infectious progeny virus particles in human neoplastic cells, whereas non-lytic strains are not (50). The reason for that is that the progeny virus particles made by non-lytic strains contain inactive versions of F molecules. Advantages of the lytic properties of some NDV strains is that the production of infectious progeny virus particles, after a first round of viral infection, gives them the ability to spread the virus in tumor tissues via multicyclic replication (see\nFig.\n3, right). In contrast, non-lytic strains can only perform a monocyclic replication cycle (see\nFig.\n3, left).",

This treatment caused complete tumor regression in athymic mice with a high therapeutic index (54). Recently, we characterized virological, immunological, and antitumor properties of some NDV strains. We observed that the oncolytic strain MTH-68/H was the most potent IFN-\u03b1 inducer among all NDV strains tested (54). After ultraviolet light (UV) inactivation, this strain was the only one tested that could induce in human PBMC antitumor activity in vitro (54). Upon systemic application of high doses of NDV to mice bearing a virus-susceptible intradermal tumor, no significant antitumor effects were observed with the two oncolytic strains Italien and MTH68/H (54). The treatment had nevertheless significant side effects as seen by loss of body weight (54). In contrast, when using a locoregional application system for treatment of liver metastases of luciferase-transfected murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells, MTH68/H showed a significant delay in tumor growth as well as prolonged survival but no effects on body weight (54). Surprisingly, this murine tumor cell transfectant was resistant in vitro to virus infection and oncolysis (54). These results suggest:(i)That locoregional application of oncolytic NDV is more effective than systemic i.v. application and(ii)That oncolytic NDV may mediate effects against a virus-resistant tumor line, possibly via host-mediated mechanisms\n",

NDV infection of the melanoma cells not only completely restored the proliferative response of the helper T cells but also prevented the induction of anergy (70). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the induction of the CD28-responsive complex in the T cells by co-incubation with NDV-infected melanoma cells (70).

An adjuvant effect of type I IFN could explain why most live viruses elicit strong immune responses whereas viral peptides are poorly immunogenic or tolerogenic unless supplemented with exogenous adjuvant (81). IFN-\u03b1 has been shown to induce (1) TRAIL in NK cells (82) and monocytes and (2) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (61). Interestingly, there is a crosstalk between the IFN signaling pathway and TRAIL (83). This can explain the fact that, in monocytes, NDV upregulates the expression of TRAIL, which mediates their tumoricidal activity (84).",

RIG-I participates in the recognition of paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses (76), whereas MDA-5 is central for recognition of picornaviruses (92). RIG-I binds specifically to RNA containing 5`-phosphate such as viral RNA (93), whereas mammalian mRNA is either capped or contains base modifications. RIG-1 may thus be able to discriminate between self and nonself (viral) RNA (94). RNA-activated RIG-1 binds to the CARD containing adaptor protein IPS-1, which, after a further signal cascade, activates, in the early phase, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, which is then phosphorylated, translocates to the nucleus, and induces interferon responses. In the late phase of the interferon response, the secreted interferon molecules interact with cell surface-expressed type I IFN receptors and initiate an amplification loop of the interferon response that involves STAT proteins and IRF-7 (for reviews, see (95) and (96)).",

The modular nature of gene transcription, the undetectable rate of recombination, and the lack of a DNA phase in the replication cycle make NDV a suitable candidate for the rational design of a safe attenuated vaccine and gene therapy vector (23). There may be additional in vivo mechanisms, such as cell fusion and syncytium formation, that allow virus escape from neutralizing antibodies. The general human population, however, is seronegative when tested for antibodies against NDV antigens (119, 120). The viral vector is not able to lead to cellular transformation. Finally, a robust virus production and manufacturing system is available.",

Postoperative vaccination with irradiated ESb vaccine cells infected with NDV\u2014but not with uninfected vaccine cells\u2014was able to protect approximately 50% of the mice (53).

We retrospectively hypothesized that an immunogenic vaccine should contain at least 1.5 \u00d7 106 viable tumor cells and viability should be at least 33%. Each cohort was thus divided into two groups: one that received vaccine type A fulfilling both criteria; and the other, type B, missing one or both criteria. Prognostic factors were well balanced between A and B in cohorts (a) and (c). In cohort (a), there was a benefit in survival (P = 0.026) for type A. The relative risk of dying in the group that received type A as compared with type B was 0.2 (univariate Cox model). In cohort (c), like in cohort (a), the survival benefit for vaccine type A may be ascribed to the vaccine quality, because prognostic factors were not biased. This could imply clinical effectivity in breast and ovarian cancer with ATV-NDV high-quality vaccine (144).",

To this end, we generated recombinant bispecific single-chain antibodies with a dual binding specificity. One is directed toward the CD3 or the CD28 antigen, which is expressed on human T cells. The other one is specific for the viral target molecule HN, which is expressed at the surface of ATV-NDV (146). These bispecific molecules are named, respectively, bsHN-CD3 and bsHN-CD28. By redirecting unstimulated human T cells against HN-expressing NDV-infected tumor cells, the bispecific molecule bsHN-CD3 were found to crosslink effector and target cells and to rapidly induce cytotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations (146). Figure\n10 shows a scheme of the new immunostimulatory fusion proteins and their way of function in combination with the vaccine ATV-NDV. The bsHN-CD3 protein enhanced the signal 1. The bsHN-CD28 molecule exerted T cell co-stimulatory function and led to increase of signal 2. Maximal T cell activation was achieved with tumor cells infected by NDV and modified with both new stimulatory molecules at the same time (146). This was revealed by T cell proliferation; upregulation of CD69 and CD25; and by release of cytokines, interferons, and chemokines (146). We concluded that these newly developed molecules combine high efficiency with specificity and safety (146).\n",

As a proof of principle, we constructed and used the recombinant molecule anti-HNxIL-2, which contains a scFv antibody cloned from a neutralizing HN-specific hybridoma linked to the human cytokine IL-2 (148).We observed that modifying the virus with such a bispecific fusion protein allowed virus receptor-independent tumor cell binding and gene transfer (148). Hemadsorption (HAd) and neuraminidase (NA) activity of HN of NDV was shown to be blocked by anti-HNxIL-2 (149). A recombinant NDV expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was applied to show the expression of foreign genes in virus infected tumor cells. Selective virus entry to IL-2 receptor-bearing tumor cells was observed in a mixture of Jurkat and MT-2 (IL-2 receptor [IL-2R]-positive) tumor cells (148). Retargeted virus binding to IL-2R-expressing tumor cells was not sufficient for the process of virus infection. This required in addition membrane fusion via the viral F protein.",

The recNDV with the strongest production of the gene product, which corresponds to the insertion of the GM-CSF gene before the NP gene, was then selected for further study (see\nFig.\n12). This observation is in concordance with previous data (158, 159) showing an effect of the genomic location of the insertion of the foreign gene on its gene expression. The gene product was biologically active and stable (31). Tumor vaccine cells infected with recNDV with GM-CSF as incorporated gene (rec[GM-CSF]) stimulated human PBMC to exert antitumor bystander effects in vitro in the tumor neutralization assay (TNA), which is described in Fig.\n9a. These effects were significantly increased when compared with vaccine infected by recNDV without an inserted gene (rec(\u2212)) (31). Finer analysis showed that rec(GM-CSF) led to a much higher IFN-\u03b1 response than rec(\u2212) when added as virus or as virus-modified vaccine to PBMC (31). Furthermore, two distinct cell types, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) and monocytes, were shown to contribute to the augmented IFN-\u03b1 response of PBMC (31). We concluded that the already inherent antineoplastic and immunostimulatory properties of NDV could be further augmented by the introduction of the therapeutic gene as a proof of principle. We observed also that GM-CSF initiated, in combination with the virus, a broad cascade of immunological effects in the microenvironment of the tumor vaccine (Fig.\n12) (31).\n",

The expression levels of foreign proteins (e.g., chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT] (157) or influenza virus hemagglutinin (160)) are high and the foreign genes are very stable after many passages in vitro and in vivo. RecNDV, which was modified by the insertion of a gene cassette encoding the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) HN protein between the P and M genes, was shown to induce a high serum antibody response to the foreign HN protein induced by the first immunization, although somewhat less than that observed after a wild-type HPIV3 infection (161). However, the titer after the second immunization exceeded the titer observed with HPIV3 infection, even though HPIV3 replicates much more efficiently than NDV in these animals (161). Furthermore, recNDV completely protected chickens and mice from lethal challenges of homologous and heterologous H5N1 avian influenza viruses (162). Recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) capsids displaying the enterovirus 71 VP1 fragment was shown also to be able to induce a strong immune response in rabbits (163). NDV expressing the H5 hemagglutinin gene protects chickens against Newcastle disease but also against avian influenza (164). A recNDV expressing the VP2 protein of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has also been shown to protect against NDV and IBDV (165). Similar results have been obtained with recombinant NDV engineered to express the SARS-CoV spike S glycoprotein, which protected African green monkeys against challenge with a high dose of SARS-CoV virus (32). It was therefore suggested that NDV might be a perfect vector for intranasal immunization against newly emerging pathogens (32).",

A recNDV with tumor-selective binding properties and secreting antibody would allow a high antibody concentration in the tumor microenvironment to be reached, and allow a deeper penetration of antibodies into the tissue of solid tumors. This could then avoid side effects observed with systemic application of antibody. The insertion of genes into NDV for drug activation could be of benefit when associated with the application of an anticancer drug. The enveloped, negative-stranded RNA viruses do not have the packaging constraints that encapsulated DNA viruses have.
