Through optimization of physical spaces and opening patient care units in nontraditional areas, such as postanesthesia care units, the hospital increased additional beds by 73% for critical care patients and by 58% for noncritical care patients. The total surge maximum capacity included 142 ICU and 460 non-ICU dedicated COVID-19 beds. This enhanced ability to treating patients with COVID-19 led to a significant increase in requests for transfers across the greater Chicago area. The organization has worked with hospitals across the region to selectively accept referrals where expertise and resources at Rush could be leveraged to handle difficult cases and to positively affect patient outcomes. However, these transfers had to be carefully balanced to preserve an appropriate level of capacity for incoming emergencies and non\u2013COVID-19 cases within the system. As of April 8, 2020, Rush has accounted for 18% of ICU COVID-19 beds and 68% of vented ICU cases in the city of Chicago.",

A single pager number was assigned to the rotating attendings on call, and sign-out was performed attending to attending each morning to maintain continuity of care on the service. This strategy would mitigate the need to have 1 individual on call for a long stretch of days. Furthermore, this would allow 2 fully staffed subspecialty services to work clinically apart to ensure continuity of services and redundancy within the department, in case there was any viral exposure to the providers. The lead team would also provide coverage for surge capacity to the ED, inpatient floors, and ICUs as needed to support frontline providers. Communication was strengthened across the department to ensure alignment among faculty, residents, administrators, and staff.

In addition, this would allow operating rooms (ORs) and perioperative spaces to be repurposed during the potential surge of patients with COVID-19 and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and redeploy ventilators to other patient care areas as needed. A departmental surgical prioritization list was developed to classify cases into emergent (next available OR, 3-6 hours) and time critical urgent (1-2 weeks; Table 2). When oncologic cases were scheduled, the surgical plan and potential adjuvant treatment implications were carefully reviewed at the weekly multidisciplinary tumor board. Treatment preceded with a focus on complete and efficient care while limiting utilization of inpatient resources, patient length of stay, and potential exposure risks to this immunocompromised population. This process was also in accordance with the American College of Surgeons\u2019\u201cCOVID-19 Guidelines for Triage of Cancer Surgery Patients.\u201d6 The final list was circulated to the perioperative services leadership to ensure timely access to care for critical cases emerging during this period.

By April 9, POC testing was available in the OR for all surgical cases and would facilitate the ability to perform 2 sequential tests and confirm negative results 2 to 3 days apart prior to surgery. This was deemed mandatory for all upper aerodigestive tract cases with high risk of aerosolization. Despite negative test results, all surgeons, anesthesia, and staff would wear N95 respirators in addition to standard PPE for invasive mucosal cases with high risk of aerosolization. PPE recommendations were reviewed daily; video demonstrations were created and posted for hospital-wide access; and provider simulation of PPE donning and doffing was offered. Prior to clustering of cases in the community, our department adjusted PPE recommendations and endoscopy indications for inpatient consultations in anticipation of unrecognized admitted cases.

Percutaneous and bedside/OR open tracheostomy was part of the care pathway, dependent on patient factors and provider considerations. Given the high risk of aerosolization in these potentially positive cases of COVID-19, a specific type of powered air-purifying respirator, termed controlled air-purifying respirator (CAPR; MAXAIR), was utilized. The CAPR integrates the motor, fan, filter, and controlled air flow mechanism directly in a lightweight helmet, thus eliminating the need for the breathing tube connected to a belt-mounted unit. This minimizes the need for rigorous cleaning procedures required with the powered air-purifying respirator and improves physician maneuverability during the procedure.

All ACGME program requirements were temporarily waived, with the exception of PPE resources/training, supervision, and work hour requirements. During the initial 3 weeks, 4 otolaryngology residents were deployed to a surge unit in the ED with the purpose of providing direct otolaryngology-related care to offload the ED staff to primarily care for patients with COVID-19. This need quickly reduced and shifted toward inpatient needs after the first week of the patient surge. Critical care platforms soon became the most utilized resource across the institution. Medical specialty residents were fully utilized on inpatient hospital medicine units and existing medical critical care units. The hospital quickly converted additional surge ICU beds that were staffed by surgical residents under supervision by a critical care attending. Two otolaryngology residents have participated in 1-week rotations on these units to date.",

At the time of the pandemic, the department had more than a dozen head and neck oncology, rhinology, sleep, and otology clinical trials in different phases of progression. To mitigate risks to patients, all in-person visits were postponed and follow-up transitioned to telephone visits. New clinical trials and new patient enrollment were temporarily halted until stabilization of the pandemic and to allow providers to focus on COVID-19\u2013related efforts. Multiple retrospective and prospective clinical studies were designed in close collaboration between departmental faculty and residents to investigate the impact of coronavirus on otolaryngology care. Specific efforts include investigations into smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 as well as detailed analysis of innovative workflow changes involving POC COVID-19 testing. Additionally, results of simulation-based training initiatives were formalized and submitted for publication.",

            "text": "The evolving pandemic has challenged the provision of otolaryngology care globally in an unmatched manner. The elective nature of much of our specialty has resulted in a drastic reduction of the ambulatory clinic and operative volumes so that personnel and resources can be appropriately diverted to support providers on the frontline of battling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this also represents a unique opportunity to recalibrate the clinical and academic goals of departments to align with the mission of their home institutions and local communities to meet the greater needs of the population in this extraordinary time. Most academic medical centers represent complex matrixed organizations where change management can be difficult and often slow due to multiple stakeholders and complex rules and regulations. Within 3 weeks, the entire health care system was able to transform the physical space and repurpose personnel to meet the challenges of the emerging pandemic. In parallel, the department was reorganized with a complete shift in focus to continue to provide essential ENT services but also meet the institutional needs in the broader context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The key departmental initiatives included (1) reorganization of the department into a 2-team structure for call and surge redeployment, (2) cessation of elective surgery and creation of an emergent and time-critical urgent case list, (3) transition of in-person visits to the virtual video platform and creation of safe regional sites, (4) adaptation of a web-based platform for weekly departmental meetings and educational conferences, (5) maintenance of patient engagement with close frequent communication to existing and potentially new patients on availability for telehealth and in-person options, and (6) refocus of research efforts to COVID-19\u2013related projects.",

This magnitude of change is possible only through continuous involvement and input from all stakeholders and constant communication through formal meetings and informal touch points. As it stands, this study is largely process driven and lacks data on specific outcomes of the implemented changes. Five studies are currently underway to assess the impact of the myriad changes, including the aforementioned simulation projects and POC testing in the operative and ambulatory environment. Two manuscripts have already been submitted to Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery: one on simulation training to guide proper donning and doffing of CAPR for airway procedures and the other on the impact of POC testing in the OR.",

The changes implemented weighed the competing priorities of the departmental provision of otolaryngology care with the institutional priorities for pandemic management, with the prime directive being to preserve the health and safety of the workforce. This can serve as a template for other academic departments and group practices nationally and internationally to meet these new unmet challenges, since the infection will peak at differing times in various parts of the world and thus disrupt delivery of care in an asynchronous manner.",
