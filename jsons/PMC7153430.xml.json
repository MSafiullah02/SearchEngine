            "text": "The most widely used human gene-transgenic mice are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-transgenic mice [5]. These HLA-expressed transgenic mice represent for a useful tool in studying in vivo TCR-restricted immune responses and thus were adopted in the studies of immune-related diseases during the first 10 years of this century. For example, HLA-A0201-transgenic mice were used in inducing CD8+ T cell-restricted type I diabetes (T1D) [6] and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) [7], while HLA-DRB1-transgenic mice were applied in establishing CD4+ T cell-mediated EAE [8], system lupus erythematosus (SLE) [9] and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models [10]. More recently, the respective role of HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQ8 in EAE [11] and autoimmune diabetes [12] was also studied through transgenic mice. Meanwhile, transgenic mice with distinct HLA subtype expression favor the study of HLA-related susceptibility on specific diseases, such as EAE [13], experimental autoimmune uveitis [14], arthritis [15\u201317], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis-like pulmonary responses [18], and celiac disease [19]. Although the application of HLA-transgenic mice has been reduced due to the simplification of diseases into specialized immune responses, the combination of HLA-transgenic technology and reconstitution of human immune system in immunodeficient mice has re-assigned them vitality in biomedical research, which will be discussed in the next section.",

Moreover, the establishment of chimeric mice with humanized liver accelerated the progress of the studies in hepatitis virus B [28, 29], C [30, 31], D [32], and human cytomegalovirus infection [33], which had all been blocked by the lack of optimal animal models in \u201cpre-humanized mice time.\u201d On the other side, Chen et al. tried to stabilize the function of cryopreserved human hepatocytes in immune competent mice through a novel system called \u201chuman ectopic artificial livers (HEALs),\u201d which involved juxtacrine and paracrine signal in polymeric scaffolds. They claimed that mice transplanted with HEALs exhibited persistent normal liver function for weeks and thus provided a window for drug-related investigation [34]. However, the efficacy and value of humanized liver mice in the development of drug are still on debate due to the proposed side effects such as ongoing liver injury caused by transgenic and the influences on \u201cnormal metabolism\u201d mediated by exogenous treatment [35, 36]. Apart from these, the potential application of humanized liver mice in immune-related research also deserves further exploration because liver also represents for a critical component of human immune system.",

The graft used for reconstituting human immune system includes stem cells [42], BLT [41], and peripheral blood cells [43] according to specific objectives. Generally, stem cell and BLT transplantation exhibit advantage in establishing stable multi-lineage hematopoietic cells but might need additional treatment for improving development of specific cell subpopulations. On the contrary, humanized mice established by peripheral blood cells provide a ready platform for studying the functions of mature immune cells but the length of window appropriate for research is still limited by chronic GVHD and ongoing reduced engraftment. To maximize the potential of humanized mouse model, some progresses have been made recently. Firstly, pretreatment or gene-engineering of pluripotent stem cell exhibited satisfactory effects on improving engraftment of immune cells [38, 42, 44]. Secondly, human growth factors, cytokines [44, 45] or signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa)-expressed [46] immunodeficient mice demonstrated superior engraftment for specific immune cell subpopulations as well. In the following paragraphs, we briefly review current status of the reconstitution of specific immune cell subpopulations in humanized mice.",

Although human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) transplantation led to rapid reconstitution of human lymphocytes in humanized mice, it was found that after initial activation and induction of antibody production, human T cell lymphocytes enter an unresponsiveness status due to loss of human professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), which could be reversed by adoptive transfer of human APC [47] or activating organ-resident myeloid dendritic cells (DC) through poly(I:C) treating [48]. Meanwhile, stem cell-transplanted humanized mice displayed diversified T cell repertoire, but the gap between HLA and murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules prohibited the induction of efficient T cell-mediated primary immune responses in vivo [49, 50]. To overcome these problems, HLA-expressed immunodeficient mice were generated and their efficacy has been confirmed [51]. Another concern origins from Th1 and Th17 immunocompetence in humanized mice [52], which supports the utility of their application as surrogate model in transplantation rejection and autoimmunity but might cause some unwanted immune responses against murine tissue antigen as well.",

However, the improvements in their survival, differentiation and even migration and residence [58] are still urgently required. Besides leukocytes, other blood components also play important roles during immune response and regulation.

In 2011, Choi et al. induced human CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells, CD34+CD38loCD1a\u2212 (thymus setting-progenitors, TSP), CD34+CD38loCD1a\u2212 (early T lineage progenitors, ETP), and CD34+CD38+CD1a+ pre-T cells in liver of humanized mice by intrahepatic injection of CD34+ stem cells, establishing a wonderful platform for investigating human T cell development [60]. However, Joo et al. found that human T cells educated by murine MHC in mice without a human thymus differ from normal human T cells marked as higher expression of CD45RO and promyelocytic leukemia zinc figure protein (PLZF) regardless of similar development stages [61]. Correspondingly, Danner et al. generated HLA-DR4-expressed NOD-Rag1\u2212/\u2212\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 mice and demonstrated the critical role of HLA class II molecule for development of functional T cells by infusion with HLA-DR-matched human hematopoietic stem cells [62]. Meanwhile, the roles of IL-12 [63] and Notch [64] signals during the development of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were evaluated by human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted mice. Moreover, using a human stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-3-expressed NOD/scid-\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 mice, Billerbeck et al. found the increased accumulation of human CD4+\nFoxp3+ T cells in blood, spleen, bone marrow and liver. Most importantly, these CD4+Foxp3+ T cells exhibited potent suppressive capability on T cell proliferation, which made a significant contribution to study of human regulatory T cells (Treg) development in vivo [65].",

The addition of human original cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-4 was generally accepted as an efficient way to improve DC maturation [70]. Similarly, the effects of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and Fms-related tyrosine kinase (FLT)-3 ligand on promoting the development of macrophage [71], and CD141+ and CD1c+ DC [72] have also been confirmed in humanized mouse model respectively. Moreover, the development of megakaryocytes was replicated and used as index of dengue virus-infection in humanized mouse model recently [73], which also supported the multi-lineage hematopoietic cell development in humanized mice. Finally, transplantation of human stem cells from bone marrow of patients with bone marrow failure syndrome into humanized mice provided invaluable tools for evaluating novel gene-targeted therapy before clinical trial [74].",

            "text": "The advances in the study of autoimmune diseases in humanized mice, especially those T cell-mediated diseases, are always correlated with development of HLA-transgenic technology. In 1999, Bachmaier et al. generated a CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 double-knockout mice transgenic for human CD4 and HLA-DQ6 to specifically reconstitute the human HLA-DQ6/CD4 arm in mice and established a dilated cardiomyopathy model [76], which was one of the earliest attempt for applying humanized mouse model in the study of autoimmune diseases. Using similar strategy, Eming et al. established a RA model in a HLA-DR4/human CD4/TCR combined transgenic mice with the stimulation of a RA-related human autogenic protein HCgp-39 in 2002 [77]. However, the lack of human immune system reconstitution in these models constrained their representative for the whole map occurring during autoimmune diseases. On the other side, Shultz et al. established T1D model in NOD/scid-\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 mice by co-transplanting with human stem cell and islet cells [78, 79]. Importantly, this group pointed out the potential of HLA-transgenic immunodeficient mice in optimization of these models and provided some interesting preliminary data [78]. Soon after, inflammatory arthritis and type 2 diabetes models were established in HLA-transgenic humanized mice by David [80] and Schultz groups [81] respectively. As we mentioned previously, T cell-mediated immune responses were generally incomplete in humanized mice established on conventional immunodeficient mice, which usually led to insignificant clinical symptoms [82] and thus limited the application of these models. The involvement of HLA not only improves the efficacy of immune responses, but also provides a platform for study of the relationship between HLA subtypes and specific diseases susceptibility. Nevertheless, the complexity and individuality of HLA phenotypes in healthy donors or patients still remain as the biggest challenge in rebuild of physiopathology process in relatively limited HLA-expressed humanized mice.",

Using this strategy, three independent groups reported allogeneic islet transplantation [89], xenogeneic islet rejection [90], and xenogeneic skin rejection [91] models during 2010\u20132012. Unfortunately, insufficient development of immune cell populations in these humanized mice still stayed as an obstacle and even led to the failure of rejection [89]. To solve this problem, some other groups tried to develop a more \u201cmature\u201d human immune system in humanized mice by transplanting human peripheral blood cells. In 2013, our group reported a novel human allogenic GVHD model established on humanized mice reconstituted with human PBMC [92]. This model reproduced typical clinical process of acute GVHD occurring during allogeneic bone marrow transplantation without apparent interruption of exogenous reactivity. Using this model, we evaluated the protective effects of human CD8+ Treg induced ex vivo by allogeneic CD40-activated B cells and found that human CD8+ Treg could inhibit GVHD and induce long-term tolerance without compromising general immunity and graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity [92]. The potent regulatory activity of the CD8+ Treg was mainly mediated by the expression of cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 on cell surface, while their alloantigen-specificity and the ability to induce the long-term tolerance favor their clinical application. More importantly, this strategy might reduce clinical dependence on limited HLA-match donors and largely improve the survival chance of millions of patients who are waiting for bone marrow transplantation.",

Mucosa, especially respiratory and digestive tract surface, plays indispensable role in protection and immune regulation. However, the residence and exchange of immune components in the locus are still difficult to rebuild in animal models because the physiological dynamics remains largely unknown [99]. Another reason is due to their complex gnotobiotic microenvironment. To meet this requirement, Gordon\u2019s group firstly established a humanized gnotobiotic mice by transplanting fresh or frozen adult human fecal microbial communities into germ-free C57BL/6J mice and then investigated the effect of diet on human gut microbiome [100]. Similarly, Kashyap et al. determined the relationship among diet, gastrointestinal transit and gut microbiota using the same model [101], while Macrobal et al. further compared the difference between gnotobiotic humanized mice and conventional mice urine and fecal metabolomics profiles [102]. Recently, another exciting breakthrough in immune reconstitution of the gastrointestinal tract was reported by Nochi\u2019s group. They developed human gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in mouse cryptopatches and succeeded in generating functional intestinal immunity marked by human IgA secretion in a BLT-NOD/scid mice model [103]. The combination of this humanized mouse model and gnotobiotics transfer will greatly improve our understanding on intestinal physiology and immune regulation.",

The earliest attempts of inducing antitumor immune responses in humanized mice focused on the generation of specific antibody but the outcome varied due to unstable humanization of models [104, 105]. In the new century, researchers started to pay more attention on developing complete tumorigenicity, especially metastasis process and its relationship with stromal cells, in immunocompetent humanized mice, and made some significant advances in multiple fields like human prostate cancer [106], mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) [107], human primary squamous cell carcinoma [108], and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-induced T cell leukemia [109]. Based on these progresses, some novel immunotherapy strategies were evaluated on humanized mouse models, such as inhibitory receptor Ig-like transcript (ILT)-3 depletion or blockade in melanoma [110] and IL-15-enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against human breast cancer [111]. Recently, our group reported a novel application of pamidronate, a phosphoantigen generally used to treat osteoporosis, in treating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced B cell lymphoproliferative disease in humanized mouse model reconstituted with human PBMC [112]. This \u201cnew application of an old drug\u201d was mediated by expanding and activating human V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cells, a small cell population of human lymphocytes, which might inspire further exploration of currently available resources. More importantly, the established of donor- and tissue-specific humanized mouse tumor models will undoubtedly play an indispensable role during the development of individual therapies in the future [113].",

The new generation of humanized mice not only improved our understanding on transmission, latency, and pathogenesis of HIV [114\u2013119], but also provided unprecedented platform for antiviral study. Besides further exploration of efficient virus-specific neutralization antibodies [120\u2013125] and conventional antiretroviral or antimicrobial therapies [126\u2013128] in these models, the efficacy of vectored immunoprophylaxis [129] and CCR5-targetd treatment [130\u2013132] in preventing HIV transmission were evaluated as well. Meanwhile, the crucial roles of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells [133, 134] and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) [135, 136] in the replication of virus and activation of immune responses, and their potentials in targeted therapy were also investigated. Other novel immunotherapy assays performed in humanized mouse model included blockade of programmed cell death (PD)-1 receptor [137, 138], engineering HIV-resistant T cells from short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells [139], and inhibition of HIV replication by a chimera containing an RNA aptamer with high binding affinity to the HIV envelop protein gp120 and virus neutralization properties and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) triggering sequence-specific degradation of HIV RNAs [140]. Moreover, a preliminary study on mechanisms underlying viral controlling in HLA-B*57 elite controller or suppressor (ES) was completed in humanized BLT mice and demonstrated that elite suppressors are capable of controlling HIV-1 due to the possession of unique host factors rather than infection with defective virus in vivo [141]. Nowadays, we could even make in-depth study on the cell dynamics in HIV-infected humanized mice model with the help of intravital microscopy [142]. Therefore, it is countable that the future molecular biology will bring more surprise to the efforts of gene therapy against HIV [143].",

We demonstrated that aminobisphosphonate can control influenza disease through boosting human V\u03b39V\u03b42-T cell immunity and this beneficial effect is active against viruses of varying subtypes and virulence [43]. Nevertheless, differences in the characteristics of molecules, tissues, and organs between human and mice might impair efficiency of pathogen infection and initiation of specific immune responses [167]. In 2005, Lassning et al. increased the susceptibility of mice on human coronavirus by crossing aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for human coronavirus (hCoV)-229E, and transgenic mice into signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-1 null mice [168]. This work, together with HLA- and human cytokines/growth factor-transgenic technology [169], provided successful examples for future studying human infectious agents in humanized mice. In the next stage, improvement of versatility and variability of human immune system in humanized mouse model and application of gene-modified pathogens [170] will definitely enhance translational efficiency of these models.",

The increasing applications of diverse humanized mice models in biomedical research during the past two decades significantly improved our understanding on human physiological and pathological, especially immunological process at systemic, cellular, and molecular levels. This further accelerated the development of current translational medicine significantly. Nevertheless, there are several major caveats on their development remain to be dealt with, including complete replacement of murine MHC with diversified HLA molecules and efficient methodology to express corresponding growth factors and cytokines at specific time and organs [174]; how to prolong the maintenance of human engraftment, promote the development of myeloid cells and increase relatively weak quantity and quality of immune cells [175]; and the limited development of lymph nodes, inter-organ traffic of immune cells, and the reconstitution of red blood cells and granulocytes [176]. In another word, the most important issue is to find the convenient and cost-effective ways to construct appropriate human-like microenvironment including physical structure, intercellular contact and molecular signals transfer in humanized mice. It is foreseeable that knowledge exchange in the age of big data will bring an even more bright future to this advancing tool than ever.",
