            "text": "Malaria is a life-threatening arthropod-borne disease with high fatality rate in tropical countries. Almost one million patients with severe malaria are dying a year in the world [1]. The disease is caused by five distinct species of protozoa, namely Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium knowlesi. A majority of malaria infections are caused by P. falciparum (over 90%), followed by others species [2\u20135]. The 2000 World Health Organization (WHO) malaria case classification categorized the severity of malaria into severe (P. falciparum) and uncomplicated malaria [6, 7]. Diagnosis of severe malaria is evaluated if the condition is caused by P. falciparum infection with one or more of the followings: coma (cerebral malaria), metabolic acidosis, organ failure, and severe anaemia [8, 9]. High-risk factors for severe malaria are non-immune patients, immune-compromised patients, and those with a high burden of malaria parasites. A rapid increase of parasites in blood is the associated finding with severe malaria [10]. Thus, early parasite detection and the immediate start of treatment are key events to reduce severe form in malaria patients [11]. Microscopic examination of blood films, antigen detection, and molecular testing has been standard methods to detect malaria infection [7, 12]. Nowadays, microarray analysis and miRNA approach have helped many researchers to understand the relationship between dysregulation of miRNA and many infectious diseases [13\u201320].",

The miRNA genes are located mainly in the non-coding region of the genome and are firstly transcribed to primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) [27, 28]. The miRNA was a synthesis in the nucleolus/cytoplasm and some released from apoptotic cells (Fig. 1) [25, 29, 30]. The early studies on miRNAs were done using organ or biopsy tissue. The limitation of testing may relate to tissue type, volume and extraction method. The discovery of miRNAs as promising disease biomarkers either in the blood or plasma was a breakthrough [31].\n",

These effects were detectable in blood samples drawn from healthy individuals or in samples with delayed blood separation. Another factor to modify miRNA levels in plasma was co-extraction of cellular miRNAs from blood cells or cell debris. Membrane filters with low protein binding affinity were recommended, although the timing of filtration was still debated. In the case of unavailable tissue samples, it is a useful solution to detect miRNAs in blood or plasma samples. The analysis of circulating miRNAs is less invasive than tissue biopsy. Thus, these new molecules have been used in many diseases as the new biomarkers such as malignant diseases and cardiovascular diseases [39\u201341].

Umbach et al. showed the latency associated transcript (LAT) was primary miRNA precursor to control four distinct miRNAs in herpes simplex virus. They reported miR-H2-3p related to viral HSV-1 replication by controlling viral gene expression at the latent period of infection [43]. Hook et al. found miR-UL112-1 related to viral target factors (UL114), which regulated cytomegalovirus to attach hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow for reactivation and replication. Cytomegalovirus used miR-UL148D-1 and miR-UL112-1 to the target gene with the function of immune evasion. This action used RANTES, a chemokine to augment immune cells to infection site and prevented the attack from NK cells to infected cells [44].",

Firstly, He et al. and Zhu et al. identified miR-223 and miR-454 as important molecules, respectively, for pathogenesis in schistosomes infection [16, 46, 47]. The miR-223 had a function as the transcription regulator, transcription factor activity, DNA binding, and a role of miR-454 in progression via the TGF-\u03b2/Smad4 pathway in this parasite [16, 47]. In Leishmania infection, Geraci et al. demonstrated that the dysregulation of miR-21 and miR-146b-5p that were associated with L. donovani-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Two miRNAs act via the tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway [18]. For protozoa infection, they found that decreased miR-221 levels were indicative of Cryptosporidium parvum infected epithelial cells with luciferase activity assay [19]. Sa\u00e7ar et al. [20] also reported that miR-328 levels relate to toxoplasmosis infection in human. The discovery of many parasite-specific miRNAs profiles can be used to apply in clinical practice. Cryptosporidium spp. and Toxoplasma spp. are Apicomplexa parasites, related to Plasmodium [48].

            "text": "Malaria-infected RBCs can develop in malaria parasites compose with two asexual stages in human (blood steam and liver) and sexual stage in the mosquito. In human, these parasites invade into human red blood cells (RBCs) until the mature parasite sequestration using cytoadherence ligand of P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein-1 (PfEMP-1) [49, 50]. Splenic macrophages are the main of clearance of malaria from blood circulation. The miRNA possibly helps malaria to invade and grow in RBCs via escape from immune responses and defect of opsonization by circulating macrophage [49, 51\u201353]. Analysis of plasmodium genome demonstrated more than 500 genes [54]. Two groups reported that P. falciparum did not have miRNA-sequences in parasite genome [50, 55]. They made a clone of all RNAs from a mixed stage of malaria-infected RBCs and then tested with bioinformatics method. It showed no matching between those cloned sequences and miRNA structures. There has been no study showing the presence of RNAi-family [siRNA, miRNAs, repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)] according to the stage of the parasite. In some infectious diseases, interactions between host miRNA and pathogen gene, or vice versa, were reported. For examples, human miRNAs including miR-223 suppress human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) mRNA [56], Epstein-Bar virus miRNA: miR-BHRF1-3 targets human interferon (IFN)-inducible T cell-attracting chemokine (CXCL11) gene expression [57], and human miR-122 targets to hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA [58]. However, it is still not known whether human miRNA interacts with malaria mRNAs. Further examination may bring the miRNA-based diagnosis or therapeutic approaches. The posttranscriptional gene silencing in Plasmodium parasites changes alternative pathways other than miRNAs. The possibility is that Plasmodium is utilizing host miRNAs to regulate their gene expression [49, 59, 60].",

For P. falciparum malaria, Rathjen et al. found that the block of miR-451 synthesis pathway by knocking out Ago2 which produces mature miR-451 resulted in the development of severe anaemia in mice [55]. Similar to the previous study that miR-451 is an essential molecule for erythroid cells since miR-451 was up-regulated during human erythroid differentiation [61]. Xue et al. [50] also showed that 36 clones of miRNA were found in infected erythroid cells, not in malaria parasite and the majority of genome composes with 80\u201390% of A-T rich sequence in P. falciparum parasites. Both studies did not found any Plasmodium specific miRNAs; those might be an effect from cells culture method. In erythroid cells, LaMonte et al. and Chapman et al. found that the levels of miR-233 and miR-451 were high in these parasite-infected cells when compared with normal [49, 62]. They suggested that impaired growth of parasites might be resulted from a block of mRNA translation by miR-451 and miR-223 in human red blood cells. Thus, Rathjen et al. and Xue et al. demonstrated that parasite could diminish miR-451 level in serum, but be accumulated in Plasmodium-infected RBCs. Similar to Chamnanchanunt et al. observed the lower levels of miR-451 and -16 in serums from 22 P. vivax patients than non-infected subjects [63]. This group also found downregulation of miR-451 and -16 in red blood cells of P. vivax patients [64]. Reducing miR-451 relates to Ago2 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) to stimulate oxidative damage in infected-RBCs [65]. Interestingly, Baro et al. [66] demonstrated that miR-221/222, -24 and -191 were decreased in bone marrow in P. vivax malaria patients. The numbers of P. falciparum patients need to more large scale study.\n",

These findings suggested that miRNAs might be reprogrammed to minimize disease severity after infection.

Furthermore, a study by El-Assaad et al. found that mouse with cerebral malaria had overexpression of miR-27a, miR-150, and let7i levels in brain tissue compared to a mouse with no cerebral malaria [69].

The hypoxic condition occurs as the results from apoptosis, microvascular occlusion, cytoadhesion from parasitized RBCs aggregates in brain vessels, and then lead to high lactate levels in cerebrospinal fluid, hypoperfusion or constriction of small vessels [69]. Lou et al. reported the upregulated levels of miR-210 (involved in the regulation of the revascularization) in hypoxic condition. Sabirzhanov et al. showed downregulated miR-23a and miR-27a that injured cortex after traumatic brain injury [79, 80]. He et al.

Moreover, a hypoxic condition induced upregulation of miR-210 in the patients with malignancy and cerebrovascular diseases [81]. The explanation of miR-210 in hypoxia-induced acidosis related to the action of Ephrin-A3 (EFNA3), and neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1) in the brain. Another study by Krupinski found that miR-120 levels have a positive correlation between an encephalopathy with lactic acidosis patients [82].
