Therefore asset prices should be related to the behavior of website users. This syllogism has been investigated in details in [9] : the price returns of the components of the Russell 3000 index are regressed on many factors, including GT data, and these factors are averaged over all of the 3000 assets. Interestingly, the authors find inter alia a significant correlation between changes in SVI and individual investors trading activity. In addition, on average, variations of SVI are negatively correlated with price returns over a few weeks during the period studied (i.e, in sample). The need to average over many stocks is due to the amount of noise in both price returns and GT data, and to the fact that only a small fraction of people who search for a given keywords do actually trade later. [24] 's claim is much stronger: it states that future returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average are negatively correlated with SVI surprises related to some keywords, hence that GT data contains enough data to predict financial indices. Several subtle (and not so subtle) biases prevent their conclusions from being as forceful as they could be. Using a robust backtest system, we are able to confirm that GT data can be used to predict future asset price returns, thereby placing their conclusions on a much more robust footing.",

It explains in part why backtest performances are often very good in the 80s and 90s, but less impressive since about 2003, even when one accounts for realistic estimates of total transaction costs. Finding predictability in old data with modern tools is indeed easier than it ought to be. Think of applying computationally cpu-or memory-intensive methods on pre-computer era data. The best known law of the computational power increase is named after Gordon Moore, who noticed that the optimal number of transistors in integrated circuits increases exponentially with time (with a doubling time \u03c4 2 years) [23] . But other important aspects of computation have been improving exponentially with time, so far, such as the amount of computing per unit of energy (Koomey' law, \u03c4 1.5 years [18] ) or the price of storage (Kryder's law, \u03c4 2 years [19] ). Remarkably, these technological advances are mirrored by the evolution of a minimal reaction timescale in financial data [16] . In addition, the recent ability to summon and unleash almost at once deluges of massive cloud computing power on large data sets has changed the ways financial data can be analyzed. It is very hard to account for this bias. For educational purposes, one can familiarize oneself with past computer abilities with virtual machines such as qemu [2] tuned to emulate the speed and memory of computers available at a given time for a given sum of money.",

It used to be made of real numbers whose normalization was not completely transparent; it also gave uncertainties on these numbers. Quite consistently, the numbers themselves would change within the given error bars every time one would download data for the same keyword. Nowadays, GT returns integer numbers between 0 and 100, 100 being the maximum of the time-series and 0 its minimum; small changes of GT data are therefore hidden by the rounding process; error bars are no more available, but it is fair to assume that a fluctuation of \u00b11 should be considered irrelevant. In passing, the process of rounding final decimals of prices sometimes introduces spurious predictability, which is well known for FX data [17] . Revised data also concerns the investible universe. Freely available historical data does not include deceased stocks. This is a real problem as assets come and go at a rather steady rate: today's set of investible assets is not the same as last week's. Accordingly, components of indices also change. Analyzing the behavior of the components of today's index components in the past is a common way to force feed it with future information and has therefore an official name: survivor(ship) bias.

First, let us compare the resulting cumulated performance of the three random keyword sets that we defined, plus the set of keywords from the Financial Times. For each sets of keywords, we choose as inputs the raw SVI, lagged SVI, and various moving averages of SVI, together with past index returns. It turns out that none of the keyword sets brings information able to predict significantly index movements (see Fig. 4 ). This is not incompatible with results of [9, 11, 24] . It simply means that the signal is probably too weak to be exploitable in practice.
