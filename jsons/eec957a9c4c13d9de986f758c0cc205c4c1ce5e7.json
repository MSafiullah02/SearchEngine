            "text": "The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has aroused great 28 public health concern. As a new coronavirus which was responsible for a 29 large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in piglets in China, swine acute diarrhea 30 syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) originated from the same genus of 31 horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as SARS-CoV and possesses a broad species 32 tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse 33 species. Given the importance of the spike glycoprotein (S) protein in viral 34 entry and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the 35 SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 \u00c5. Our 36 studies reveal that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary 37 packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together 38 by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other 39 four genera gives the suggestion of the evolutionary procedure of the 40 SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural 41 features, i.e., more compact architecture of S trimer, masking of epitopes by 42 glycan shielding, which may facilitate to viral immune evasion. These data 43 provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and 44 would deepen our understanding of their structural and functional diversity 45 which will facilitate to vaccine development.",

In this study, a cryo-EM structure of 110 SADS-CoV S glycoprotein at 3.55 \u00c5 resolution is determined. Correspondingly 111 in the present investigation of SADS-CoV, we portrayed the general structure 112 of the S protein and the organization of its structural components. In light of the structures and functions of these essential components, we detail the 114 evolutionary perspective of SADS-CoV S in comparison with S proteins from 115 different CoV genera. In our study, SADS-CoV S forms a \"lying down\" 116 conformation following transition from inactive to active state and ACE2 is not HR-C (Fig. 1D, Fig. S3 ). Forty-five (15 on each subunit) N-linked glycans 148 spread over the surface of whole S trimer with another 15 predicted but not 149 observed. In addition, the protein trimer is stabilized by 30 pairs (10 on each 150 subunit) of disulfide bonds (Fig. S4 ). The S trimer shows a dome-like shape, 151 with three S1 heads forming a crown-like structure and sitting on top of a 152 trimeric S2 stalk (Fig. 1D, 1E and Movie S1). The trimer spike has a length of 153 143.2 \u00c5 from S1 to S2 and a width of 111.3 \u00c5 and 61.4 \u00c5 at S1 and S2, 154 respectively (Fig. 1E) . Three S1-CTDs are located at the top center of the S 155 trimer arranged as a small triangle, whereas three S1-NTDs are located on the 156 lower and outer side of S1-CTDs arranged as a big triangle. This architecture, 157 i.e., CTD sandwiched by its own NTD and the adjacent NTD, comes into being 158 one side of the big triangle (Fig. 1F) . The cleavage site of S1 and S2 subunits 159 locates between residues 544 (Val) and 545 (Arg). The central helicase N 160 (CH-N) and C (CH-C) of S2 from each subunit form a six-helix bundle in the 161 core of S trimer. Heptad repeats N (HR-N) contains four helices connected by 162 three loops locked between the S1 and S2 subunit at the outside of the S2 163 stalk, while part of the HR-C is missed in the structure (Fig. 1G) . Each 164 monomeric subunit of S1 contains two major domains, S1-NTD and S1-CTD 165 which are used to bind attachment sialic acid receptors or protein receptors 166 and play a key role in the coronavirus entry, and two subdomains, SD1 and 167 SD2 whose function are not very clear ( Fig. 1H-1I , Movie S1).

This 219 kind of conformation represents an inactive state (Fig. 2H) . The CTDs in our 220 structure keep a \"lying down\" state and the receptor-binding moieties are 221 partially concealed. It needs to \"stand up\" on the spike trimer and release the 222 steric clash for efficient receptor binding. The linker between CTDs and S1 223 subdomains workes as a hinge to facilitate the conformation change of CTDs 224 from \"lying down\" to \"stand up\", furthermore, transit the receptor-binding 225 inactive state to active state (Fig. 2F) . 226 It is noteworthy that stronger interactions in SADS-CoV spike trimer may 227 obstacle conformational change and dissociation of S1-CTD in prefusion 228 process (Fig. S5) .

            "text": "Because such large conformational transition may happen over long time 241 scales (ms to s), far beyond the simulations performed here. Taken together, 242 these simulation results may explain the homogeneity of SADS-CoV spike 243 observed in our 3D classification and that the different S1-CTD conformations 244 are invisible in our results (Fig. 1B) . 245 For the NTDs, the core structure consists of two six-stranded antiparallel 246 \u03b2-sheet layers stacked together which takes the same galectin fold as human 247 galectins and the NTDs from the other genera. Besides the core structure, 248 NTD of SADS-CoV S1 also has a loop (residues 133-150) formed as a partial 249 ceiling-like structure that resembles the partial ceiling of \u03b3-coronavirus rather 250 than the other \u03b1-and \u03b4-coronavirus which do not have a ceiling-like structure, 251 or the \u03b2-coronavirus which has a reinforced ceiling-like structure (Fig. 2I-M) . 252 Based on the structural similarity between the NTDs from four different CoVs 253 genera, the sugar-binding site in SADS-CoV S1-NTD might also be located in 254 the pocket formed between the core structure and the partial ceiling (Fig. 2I) . 255 Compared with other CoVs, the structure of the subdomain under the core 256 domain of SADS-CoV S1-NTD has the same situation of the partial ceiling-like 257 structure (Fig. 2I-M) . Previous study gave the idea that NTDs from the four 258 genera form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of \u03b1-, \u03b4-, \u03b3-and \u03b2-genera, 259 with \u03b1-CoVs NTD probably being the most ancestral [24] . Our structure has 260 also unexpectedly consisted with this conclusion. Furthermore, we propose 261 that the structural evolution of SADS-CoV S1-NTD is more likely to located 262 between the other \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b4-CoVs and \u03b3-CoVs. 263 For the CTDs, despite there are dramatic sequential differences between 264 SADS-CoV S1-CTD and other CTDs, all of them share the similar structural 265 topology [24] (Fig. 2N-R) . Unlike the other CTDs of \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs which 266 have a more compact core \u03b2-sandwich structure containing two \u03b2-sheet layers, 267 our CTD resembles the \u03b3-and \u03b2-CoVs which just has one layer \u03b2-sheet and 268 several \u03b1-helix and coil structures with a loose packing (Fig. 2N-R) . of CTDs as its receptor binding motif (RBM). As a result, we propose that 272 SADS-CoV also uses these loops on the CTD as its RBM (Fig. 2N-P) . 273 Moreover, the CTDs of \u03b3-CoVs evolves to get extended loops and the \u03b2-CoVs The CTDs from different genera give an evolutionary spectrum, using \u03b1-and 282 \u03b4-CoVs CTDs as ancestral, \u03b3-CoVs CTDs as the transitional structure and 283 \u03b2-CoVs CTDs the downstream structure, but the evolutionary direction could 284 go either way [24] . Hence, we propose that the SADS-CoV S1-CTD located 285 between the other \u03b1-, \u03b4-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs CTDs on the evolutionary spectrum 286 (Fig. 2N-R) . (H). Structures of S1 monomer from SARS-CoV. The left panel shows the S1 301 subunit in a \"lying down\" state, while the right panel shows the S1 subunit in a 302 \"stand up\" state. The conformational change of the subunits from \"lying down\" (Table S1 ). In addition, the Dali analysis of CTD 332 showed that SADS-CoV S CTD is relatively poorly conserved with \u03b2-CoVs, as (Table S2) . Taken together, these results are 336 consistent with that of the sequence alignment. (NL63-CoV)-ACE2 (Fig. 3B-3D ) and the CTDs of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV 350 and SADS-CoV (Fig. 3E) . Surprisingly, although SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV 351 and SADS-CoV CTD do not share significant sequence homology and belong 352 to different family of CoVs (Fig. 3A) , they share roughly identical organization 353 and core folding (Fig. 3E) . Notably, SADS-CoV uses the variant loop region as 354 its RBM which is consist with the insertion domain of SARS-CoV and 355 SARS-CoV-2 CTDs that is formed by two \u03b2 sheets and several loops (Fig. 3E) . 356 Meanwhile, compared with the \u03b2-CoVs SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the On one hand, the SADS-CoV S has a classical compact structure as other 380 \u03b1-CoVs, which uses the intra-subunit packing mode ( Fig. 2A-2B) . As a result, shows that there are fifty N-linked glycans spreading over the surface of each 397 S subunit. They are mainly located on the surface of S1 rather than on S2 like 398 HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 4A) . In contrast to that HCoV-NL63 S evades host immune 399 surveillance mainly by glycan shielding its S2 epitopes, SADS-CoV spike 400 appears to evade host immune surveillance mainly by glycan shielding its S1 401 epitopes [31]. In addition, unlike the other \u03b1-coronavirus and \u03b4-coronavirus 402 whose putative sugar-binding sites are surrounded by glycans, most of the 403 SADS-CoV N-linked glycosylation sites are located on the CTD (Fig. 4A-4B) . 404 As a result, the putative sugar-binding sites on the NTD are shielded, not by 405 glycans, but by the partial ceiling-like structure on the top of the core structure.

CoVs 58 have a place with the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order 59 Nidovirales, and grouped into four genera for example alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), both 60 CoVs infecting mammals, gamma (\u03b3) CoVs infecting birds, and delta (\u03b4) CoVs 61 infecting mammals and birds [5]. CoVs bring about subclinical or respiratory 62 syndrom, central nervous system (CNS) infections, gastrointestinal ailments in 63 humans, and animals [6-8]. These infections are accountable for 30% of the 64 respiratory illnesses, atypical pneumonia [3, 9] and show a tendency for 65 interspecies transmission which happened rather often during CoV evolution 66 and shaped the diversity of CoVs [10]. 67 Porcine CoVs are chief health concerns of the pigs and are 68 considerable enteric and respiratory infections causing agents of swine. A 69 novel CoV instigating swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) emerged since 70 August 2016. It is associated with HKU2-related Rhinolophus bat CoV with 71 death rate up to 90% in piglets 5 days or younger in Guangdong territory pig 72 breeding farms and accounted for the killing of around 25,000 piglets [11]. 73 SADS-CoV has a position with the class \u03b1-CoVs, and it is enveloped +ssRNA 74 virus [7, 12, 13]. The intracellular entry of SADS-CoV relies on a precise 75 interaction amid virion and the host cell. The disease is initiated by the 76 interplay of the viral particle with specific cell surface S trimmer [14]. 77 CoVs from various genera display evident serotypes, for the most part, 78 because of the dissimilarity of their envelope-anchored diversified S proteins. 79 S protein is of around 1300 amino acids, has a place with class I viral 80 combination protein, including SARS-CoVs, human immunodeficiency virus 81 (HIV) envelop glycoprotein 160 (gp160), influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA), 82 paramyxovirus F and Ebola virus glycoprotein [15].
