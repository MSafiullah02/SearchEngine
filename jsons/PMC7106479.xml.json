The N protein is a key component in the coronaviral core and has attracted research attention for a long period [5]. As compared with the genomes of coronaviruses discovered so far, the N protein in SARS-CoV exhibits highly variable in amino acid composition, but may perform similar physical properties. Up to date, most of the N proteins contain 380\u2013460 amino acids, with a preponderance of basic residues (58\u201372 arginine and lysine) and 7\u201310% serine content [6]. Also the N proteins range isoelectric points of 10.3\u201310.7 but with markedly acidic at their carboxy termini (pI 4.5\u20135.3) [7]. The N protein of SARS-coronavirus sizes up 422 amino acids with 60 basic amino acids and 8% of serine; and it has a theoretical pI value of 10.3 for the overall sequence and an acidic C-terminus (30 amino acids within C-terminus) with pI of 4.5. Therefore, this new coronavirus N protein is deduced to perform the similar functions as other N proteins for the viral formation or infection in host cells.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that the N proteins function as the stabilizers for the viral genomic RNAs due to the complexes of helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) generated from the N protein and RNA [8]. The phosphorylation of viral proteins, particularly for the positive charged nucleic acid binding proteins, can profoundly modulate the interactions between host cells and viruses. In rabies virus, like SARS-CoV as a single-stranded sense RNA, the dephosphorylated N protein binds more strongly to leader RNA than its phosphorylated form, resulting in a dramatic decrease of RNA transcription and replication [9]. It was postulated to attribute the stronger capacity of the dephosphorylated N protein binding with RNA to their high positive charges [10]. Whether the N protein of SARS-CoV is phosphorylated in the host cells, however, has been argued among some investigators. With proteomic means, two groups did not detect a single mass signal of phosphorylated peptide from the N protein even though the sequence coverage of peptide detection over 90% [11], [12]. Through the measurement of the intact protein mass, Ying et al. claimed no phosphorylation in the SARS N protein [12]. No evidence of the phosphorylation of the N protein was given in Krokhin's with the approaches of the de novo analysis to the N protein [11]. Lal's group described the contrary results and claimed that the N proteins of SARS-CoV localized at the nucleus as well as cytoplasm were phosphorylated by CDK [13], [14]. This group further revealed that the phosphorylation status of the N protein in SARS-CoV could perform a significant impact to S phase progression in mammalian cells [14]. This issue, however, has not been solved completely. First of all, there has been lack of accurate identification to the phosphorylation sites located at the N protein of SARS-CoV, even though the multiple phosphorylation sites could be theoretically predicted. Secondly, the evidence for the phosphorylation of the N protein was achieved from the experiments in vitro and site-mutagenesis. As a matter of fact, the real status of phosphorylated N protein in the SARS-CoV infected cells has not been clearly clarified regardless of which approaches have been employed so far.",

Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), Western blot, and mass spectrometry were first employed to separate and identify the modified N proteins. Furthermore, the phosphorylation regions amongst the N protein were analyzed using the approaches of molecular biology as well as phosphorylation of protein kinase. Finally the phosphorylated sites in the N protein were identified with the strategy of partial tryptic digestion plus MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. These experiments took the first step to define the phosphorylation sites of the N protein, and offered the solid evidence to support the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV N protein was indeed phosphorylated during virus infection to human host.",

To monitor the possible modification forms of the N protein, the proteins obtained from different expression systems were loaded to 2DE followed by dye staining as well as immuno-assay.

The N protein from E. coli exhibited a single spot located at alkalic side, whereas one from yeast appeared in string spots slightly close to acidic range. Since the expression of the N protein in mammal cells was too low to detect by dye staining, the N proteins expressed from prokaryote and eukaryote was further examined with 2DE Western blot using the anti-N antibody as the primary antibody (Fig. 2\n). Both N proteins expressed in yeast and HEK293 cells remained the similar patterns with string spots on 2DE even though the N proteins from HEK293 cells distributed along a wider pH range with more spots close to acidic pH side. The N protein from E. coli was only recognized as a single spot in Western blot, being in agreement with the 2DE result stained by Coomassie Blue. These results demonstrated that the status of the expressed N proteins was dependent on the host environment and the post-translational modifications of the N proteins could lead to the changes of the apparent pI values, but without significant change in apparent molecular mass. According to theoretical analysis as well as other research reports, phosphorylated modification was an ideal candidate to illustrate the phenomenon.",

The NetPhos 2.0 software was adopted to analyze the putative sites of phosphorylation in the N protein. The prediction results revealed that 22 serine, 8 threonine and 3 tyrosine residues could be phosphorylated in this protein (Fig. 4\n). It was obvious in Fig. 4 that a region around 180\u2013210 aa occupied 60% putative phosphorylated serine residues, so called \u201cdense serine\u201d island. On the other hand, this island also contained six arginine residues. After a completely tryptic digestion, thus, the N fragment located 180\u2013210 aa could generate a series of short peptides, which were not easily detected by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In most N proteins of coronaviruses, phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine was rarely reported. So serine phosphorylation became a target in this study. Table I listed all the putative sites of phosphorylated serine and their corresponding mass signals. Not surprisingly, these tryptic peptides located at the \u201cdense serine\u201d island were so short that they were not identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Identification of the phosphorylation sites through mass spectrometry, therefore, seemed infeasible in a complete digestion with trypsin to the N protein. More experimental designs were required to access these phosphorylated sits on the N protein.",

A strategy was introduced, in which the N protein expressed from yeast were excised and partially digested with trypsin, thus, these relatively long fragments of the N protein were achieved for peptide identification by mass spectrometry. The two kinds of the N recombinants, either from E. coli or from yeast, were used in the partially digestive experiments. Compared of the mass signals in the N peptides from E. coli, two unique mass peaks appeared in the yeast N recombinant with the significant neutral loss. As shown in Fig. 6\n, a new PMF peak at 2113.90 was detected and further analyzed by MS/MS to match with the peptide, GFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSpSR, located at 171\u2013190 aa. The residue of Ser189 was possibly phosphorylated. This fragment contained the two miss-cleaved tryptic sites, which were never found in the completely digestive products of the N protein expressed in E. coli. More importantly, when the N protein from E. coli was phosphorylated by PKC\u03b1 and the phosphorylated N protein was treated with partial digestion of trypsin, the same PMF as well as MS/MS spectra were monitored consistently. Another similar phenomenon was observed at PMF peak at 2371.10, which was further identified by tandem MS to confirm the N fragment, GNSGNSTPGSSRGNSpPARMASGGGK, located at 193\u2013217 aa (spectra not shown). The residue of Ser207 was likely phosphorylated. The mass spectrometry data, thus, provided undoubted evidence that some serine residues located at the \u201cdense serine\u201d island were the substrates for the protein kinases in host cells. These data also coincided with the prediction of NetPhos 2.0 described in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the phenomenon of the multiple 2DE spots of the N protein expressed from yeast could be partially explained by these dada. Although the MasCot search gave the results indicating Ser189 and Ser207 to be the phosphorylation sites, the phosphorylation possibility for other serine residues around Ser189 and Ser207 could not be excluded, because the neutral loss of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) could be generated from other neighbor serines but fail in detection by mass spectrometry. Therefore, enrichment of phosphorylated peptides and site-directed mutagenesis are required in further investigation to precisely define the locations for all serine candidates of phosphorylation in the N protein.",

Taking a closer look at the sequenced coronaviral genomes, the N proteins contain high percentage of serine residues with multiple theoretical phosphorylation sites. Experimentally, the phosphorylation of the N protein for other coronaviruses was demonstrated long time ago. Siddell et al. reported that the N protein of coronavirus JHM was phosphorylated during infection, specifically for serine phosphorylation [16]. Interestingly, a protein kinase that phosphorylates the N protein had a strong association with this virion, and was co-purified with the coronavirus, suggesting this viral N protein mainly existed as the phosphorylated status in the infected cells. The PRRSV N protein was confirmed to be a phosphorylated protein [17]. Notably, the phosphorylation of the N protein was not only observed in the infected cells, but also detected in the N gene transfected eukaryote cells, indicating that the phosphorylation was independent from viral components, and was associated with the amino acid sequences of the N protein or the environment of the host cells. On the other hand, even though the phenomenon of the phosphorylated N protein was discovered long time ago, the studies on these modified proteins have not been extensively carried out so far. There have been few reports regarding the phosphorylated sites in the N proteins, in particular the accurate identification based upon biochemical or molecular biological approaches [18]. Moreover, the phosphorylated N protein in coronavirus is likely to play different roles in the infected host cells. For instance, the phosphorylated N protein in MHV appeared in strong affinity to genomic RNA, the dephosphorylated MHV N protein would resulted in the viral RNA releasing [19]. However, the localization of N protein from PRRSV was not regulated by its phosphorylation [17]. Using double radiolabeling (35S and 32Pi), an equivalent distribution of the phosphorylated N protein was observed in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in the PRRSV infected host cells. To understand the phophorylaion status of the SARS-CoV N protein could extend our knowledge how SARS virus effectively infects human and causes a spread infection.",

The observation was challenged by theoretical prediction and experimental evidence. First of all, the mass data, which was obtained from a proteomic survey to the SARS-CoV proteins, was not favorable to aim at specific searching for the phosphorylated peptides. If the N protein contains multiple phosphorylation sites and not all the sites phophorylated simultaneously, the average signals for these phosphorylated peptides are expected in lowabundance. On the other hand, the phosphorylated peptides are usually suppressed in the intensity of mass signals [20]. Hence, as compared with so many high abundance non-phosphorylated peptides, these phosphorylated peptides are possible in miss-detection in such proteomic survey. Secondly, as briefly described in Section 3, the complete tryptic digestion, which was a digestion approach adopted by the two groups for proteomic search of SARS-CoV protein [11], [12], can produce several short peptides around the \u201cdense serine\u201d island which are not easily detected by mass spectrometry. Thirdly, using 2DE and Western blot, a series of string spots corresponding to the N protein were detected from the sera of the SARS patients and the Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV, suggesting that this N protein had several modification forms due to infection (unpublished observations from our group). Furthermore, Lal et al. provided the direct evidence for the phosphorylation of the N protein [13], [14]. Just based upon the logical deduction, the systematical investigation was initiated to specifically address this issue regarding the phosphorylation sites of the N protein, and the results presented here firmly supported the hypothesis that indeed the SARS-CoV N protein was phosphorylated in the host eukaryote cells.",

So the phenomenon of multiple serine phosphorylation sites located at a specific region may represent the significant features for the functions of these viruses. Identifying these phosphorylation sites is likely to partially elucidate the infection mechanisms. In the \u201cdense serine\u201d island, total of 12 serine residues could be phosphorylated. If these residues share the equal opportunities for phosphorylation, the possible modification forms are 4095 upon combination calculation. The theoretical calculation seems to well match with the experimental observations because the string 2DE spots imply many modified forms of the N protein. However, there were only two sites of the SARS-CoV N proteins identified in this study. According to the combination estimation, the two sites could only generate three forms in maximum. Obviously, the current results are still limit to fully explain the 2DE behavior of the N protein.
