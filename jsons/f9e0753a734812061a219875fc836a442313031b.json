The countrywide ban on traffic mobility greatly reduced transportation emissions, whereas emissions from residential heating and industry remained steady or slightly declined. 1 In this Comment, we examine the change in air pollution and the potentially avoided cause-specific mortality during this large-scale quarantine.",

            "text": "As of March 14, 2020, new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China reported by the National Health Commission decreased to 20 (four cases from Wuhan) (figure). By this time, most Chinese provinces had lowered the level of emergency responses. We thus defined the quarantine period as Feb 10 to March 14 and the period before quarantine as Jan 5 to Jan 20. Based on evidence from previous years, we excluded the Chinese New Year holidays to avoid reductions in air pollution that were unrelated to the quarantine (figure). We obtained daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and PM 2\u00b75 in 367 Chinese cities from Jan 1, 2016, to March 14, 2020. We focused on NO 2 and PM 2\u00b75 because both are traffic-related air pollutants whose emissions were substantially reduced as a result of the traffic bans and home quarantine, and both had well established concentration-response functions (CRFs) from one of the largest epidemiological studies in China on short-term mortality effects. 2,3 A difference-in-difference approach was then applied to quantify air pollution changes due to the quarantine. Specifically, we calculated changes in air quality during the quarantine versus before the quarantine period in 2020 and compared these findings with corresponding changes in the same lunar calendar periods from 2016 to 2019. This approach, which can also be interpreted as comparing changes in air quality in 2020 versus 2016-2019 during the quarantine period with those changes in the before quarantine period, also controlled for the long-term declining trend in air pollution because of China's clean air policy in the past few years. 4 To validate the air quality changes, we used satellite images from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, which is onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, to derive the mean NO 2 tropospheric column density for periods during and before quarantine.",

We used cause-specific CRFs from single-pollutant models because coefficients from two-pollutant models were not available. 2 Although there might have been some risk of double counting, results from published literature suggest that this risk is small because effect estimates for NO 2 and PM 2\u00b75 were similar between single-pollutant and two-pollutant models. 3, 6 Moreover, similar to previous epidemiological studies with outdoor air pollution, 7 exposure measurement error is inevitable since most people stayed indoors.",
