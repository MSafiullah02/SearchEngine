Serial follow-up chest CT showed the progression of the pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with a lower lung predominance. The patient did not have a history of pneumothorax or any underlying pulmonary disease; no abnormalities, such as a small bulla or emphysema, were observed in the initial CT kjronline.org scan. The patient had no history of smoking. As a result of diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the alveoli may be prone to rupturing. Furthermore, the patient developed a pronounced cough, which may also induce alveolar rupture. Mediastinal emphysema results from a sudden increase in the alveolar pressure, causing alveolar rupture and air leakage with interstitial emphysema (7) ; this can be observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (8) . In addition to the giant bulla, chest CT also revealed multiple bullae in the subpleural lung zones (arrowheads; Fig. 2C , E), where pneumonic consolidation was more prominent than in the contralateral areas, which could easily rupture and cause pneumothorax. While mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax are well-known complications of mechanical ventilation, the patient only received HFNC oxygen therapy before the emphysema occurred. Therefore, in this particular case, we speculate that the mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax may be related to COVID-19 pneumonia.",
