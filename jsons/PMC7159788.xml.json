Over thirty years ago, Omran (1971) introduced the concept of the epidemiological transition, describing three successive stages in human history: 1) The Age of Pestilence and Famine; 2) the Age of Receding Pandemics; and 3) the Age of Degenerative and Man\u2010Made Diseases. New evidence that a relatively healthy, pre\u2010agricultural time period existed before Omran's \u201cAge of Pestilence and Famine\u201d necessitated an important revision to this model. Barrett et al. (1998) realized that rather than representing the baseline, Omran's first stage, sparked by the transition to agriculture, instead represented the first epidemiological transition that humanity underwent.",

These latter diseases were generally zoonoses at first, infections transmitted from animals to humans (Kilks, 1990). Zoonoses can be contracted via insect or animal bites or through the hunting, preparation, and consumption of an infected animal. After a zoonotic pathogen enters a human host, several results are possible. If the pathogen finds humans to be unsuitable hosts, it may never spread beyond the initial infected individual or the transmission chain may be very short. If the human offers the invading microbe a similar environment to its natural host, a temporary host\u2010switch without substantial levels of adaptation may be feasible (Kellogg, 1896; Bowden and Drake, 2013). While maintaining a specialized niche in its natural host, the microbe may simultaneously infect humans and any other suitable hosts that cross its path. One last possibility exists. A zoonotic pathogen may enter the human population permanently, adapting to Homo sapiens. It is this last scenario that many researchers believe has resulted in some of our most important infections.",

No one would have guessed that the history of lice was as complicated as has been revealed recently, however. Mammalian lice are obligate parasites whose evolutionary history is typically closely intertwined with that of their host species. Whether or not head and body lice (Pediculus humanus) represent separate species has been a controversial subject for several hundred years, but the best supported view at present is that they are not genetically distinct (Light et al., 2008b). Genotyping studies suggest that humans with head louse infestations and poor hygiene provide an opportunity for lice to colonize clothing (Veracx et al., 2012); suited to life on clothes, possibly due to changes in gene expression patterns, these pioneers can then spark body lice epidemics (Li et al., 2010; Olds et al., 2012). Thus, the generation of body lice may be continual, and the two types of lice may be indistinguishable.",

Molecular clock analyses suggest that lineage B, which is found in America, Australia, and Europe, diverged from lineage A roughly 1 million YBP (Reed et al., 2004; Leo and Barker, 2005). Lineage C is found only in Ethiopia and Nepal (Light et al., 2008a). Some researchers have proposed that the ancient divergence between lice lineages reflects a split between early species of Homo. According to this hypothesis, a recent host switch of the New World lineage (B) from an extinct host (perhaps H. erectus) to H. sapiens could account for its apparent localization to the New World, from whence it spread recently to Australia and Europe (Reed et al., 2004; Light et al., 2008a).

Shortly after, Livingstone (1958) hypothesized that malignant malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, became hyperendemic to West Africa when farmers with newly introduced iron axes began chopping down the tropical rain forest to plant crops. Livingstone argued that hunter\u2013gatherer population sizes were not sufficient to maintain malaria. In addition, small\u2010scale swidden agriculture would have increased the number of breeding spots for the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, which transmits P. falciparum, the cause of the most severe type of malaria. As Allison and Livingstone predicted, in East and West Africa, the more intense a community's reliance on swidden agriculture, the higher the prevalence of the sickle cell trait, which protects against malaria (Wisenfeld, 1967; Piel et al., 2010). Livingstone believed that the infection was likely to have arisen as a zoonotic disease transmitted from chimpanzees, eventually becoming a human specialist (Livingstone, 1971). His hypotheses regarding agriculture and malaria have been borne out by a number of lines of genomic evidence.",

A signature of positive selection present in the G6PD gene of humans, but not in non\u2010human primates (NHPs), suggests that malaria represents a much stronger selective pressure for us than for our close relatives (Verrelli et al., 2006). The A\u2010polymorphism, which confers protection against infection, is estimated to have arisen between 3,800 and 12,000 YBP (Tishkoff et al., 2001).

For decades, all we knew about this parasite came from a single strain isolated from a chimpanzee in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Collins et al., 1986). On this basis, it seemed reasonable to believe that humans and chimpanzees both harbored their own distinct \u201cheirloom\u201d malaria strains.

The ability to obtain Plasmodium DNA from NHP feces revolutionized the ability of scientists to collect samples for sequencing. And as these new sequences poured in, it began to appear that malignant malaria was not an heirloom pathogen of humans after all. Sequence analysis showed that the global genetic diversity of human P. falciparum strains was very low relative to the diversity present in chimpanzee P. reichenowi strains, indicating that the human species had diverged more recently than the chimpanzee species (Rich et al., 2009). This finding was inconsistent with P. falciparum being an heirloom pathogen in humans. Moreover, a genetic study of nearly 3,000 wild great apes, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos from throughout central Africa, found that the strains most closely related to human P. falciparum were found in gorillas rather than chimpanzees (Liu et al., 2010). Transmission of Plasmodium from great apes to nearby humans appears to be infrequent. A survey of 1,402 blood samples collected from people living in remote areas of southern Cameroon found Plasmodium DNA in 1,000 of them (Sundararaman et al., 2013); none were infected with the Laverania parasites from which P. falciparum originated, though. It appears possible that all circulating human P. falciparum strains may be the result of a single, very successful cross\u2010species transmission event from a gorilla to a human.",

P. falciparum and other pathogens that became persistent infections in humans post\u2010agriculture are listed in Table 2. In general, it seems the post\u2010agriculture pathogens tend to cause greater levels of morbidity and mortality than the pre\u2010agriculture pathogens, as might be expected for microbes that are assured a large pool of susceptible hosts to infect. Most of the infections we associate with epidemics can be found in this list: measles, smallpox, the bubonic plague, etc. Many are associated with the WHO's list of the top ten causes of death in low income nations, though tuberculosis, a pre\u2010agriculture infection, can also be found there (WHO, 2011). Not surprisingly, many of the post\u2010agriculture pathogens, including measles, Trichinella spiralis, and Rotavirus A, appear to have originated from contact with domesticated animals (Rosenthal et al., 2008; Furuse et al., 2010; Martella et al., 2010; Ghosh and Kobayashi, 2011), while others, such as malaria, resulted from cross\u2010species transfers that were likely facilitated by new ecological patterns associated with agriculture.",

Molecular studies have demonstrated that all three human species of tapeworms, Taenia solium, Taenia asiatica, and Taenia saginata (the intermediate host for the first two is pigs, the third is cattle), actually originated in the Pleistocene (Hoberg et al., 2001; Michelet and Dauga, 2012). Although these tapeworms may be \u201csouvenir\u201d species, we did not pick them up during the course of agricultural activity. Since our tapeworms are most closely related to those harbored by big cats (in the case of T. saginata and T. asiatica) and hyenas (in the case of T. solium), it is likely that Homo species originally became infected with the tapeworms of meat eaters that were competing with us for food (Hoberg, 2006). Interestingly, seventy years ago, long before the first phylogenetic study on this subject emerged, Baer (1940) argued that cave\u2010lions could have harbored tapeworms, infecting humans via their prey. That is, prey animals could have become infected by ingesting vegetation contaminated with tapeworm eggs or gravid proglottids by cave lion feces; humans that then ate these animals could become infected, eventually becoming a primary host themselves. It seems that Baer's hypothesis was not so far off.",

M. tuberculosis and M. bovis are members of what is called the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC), a group that also includes M. africanum, a source of tuberculosis in Africa, and some animal\u2010adapted Mycobacterium species. Research on the MTBC quickly demonstrated that the direct evolution of M. tuberculosis from M. bovis was virtually impossible, as the latter had a smaller genome (Garnier et al., 2003)\u2014and the very clonal M. tuberculosis bacterium would have had no way, such as interstrain recombination, to replace missing genes. Furthermore, a phylogeny of the MTBC shows that all animal\u2010adapted strains form a single clade stemming from a group of West African human\u2010adapted lineages (Hershberg et al., 2008). Thus, it appears that animal MTBC strains originated from human infections. Are we to believe that humans transmitted tuberculosis to cattle then? The answer appears to be no, at least not directly. Based on the order in which taxa diverged, it seems that a human\u2010adapted strain of the MTBC became established in some other mammal, which served as a source of infection for yet another mammal, and so on, until cattle became infected as well (Smith et al., 2009).

They include syphilis and the non\u2010sexually transmitted infections yaws and bejel, which are typically contracted during childhood in tropical and arid regions of the world, respectively. The treponematoses leave telltale marks upon the skeleton, and, as a result, they have been studied intensively by paleopathologists. In the New World, there is clear skeletal evidence that treponemal disease was present both prior to and after agriculture came to dominate the food economy (Powell and Cook, 2005). However, whether or not treponemal disease in the Old World predated the advent of agriculture is unclear. Many historians and physical anthropologists have argued, on the basis of written records and skeletal patterns of disease, that syphilis was introduced into Europe by Columbus and his men (Baker and Armelagos, 1988; de Isla, 1539; andez de Oviedo y Valdes, 1526; er et al., 2011). Although some investigators have argued that there is evidence of Old World treponemal disease dating from the Pleistocene (Rothschild et al., 1995), the skeletal lesions described could also be due to other non\u2010treponemal causes (Harper et al., 2011).",

            "text": "It seems genomic evidence should be able to swoop in and put an end to this controversy. Unfortunately, progress has been slow. We performed a phylogenetic study on T. pallidum and found that the subspecies that causes yaws diverged prior to the other subspecies (Fig. 4) (Harper et al., 2008). However, due to a number of factors, including a lack of knowledge regarding substitution rates among these bacteria, we could not use these genetic data to determine whether the early divergence of yaws\u2010causing strains occurred pre\u2010 or post\u2010agriculture. Genetic studies have also demonstrated that strains of T. pallidum collected from wild African NHPs closely resemble human yaws\u2010causing strains, so much so that it appears they should all be considered members of a single species (Harper et al., 2012; Harper and Knauf, 2013; Zobanikova et al., 2013). However, current genetic data are compatible with several scenarios, including: 1) that African primate species, including humans, have each evolved with their own T. pallidum strains, which would mean that yaws predates agriculture in the Old World or 2) that human yaws infection was originally acquired from NHPs, which could have occurred pre\u2010 or post\u2010agriculture. The presence of treponemal disease in the pre\u2010Columbian New World suggests that humans were infected by T. pallidum prior to crossing the Bering Strait. However, no compelling evidence of Pre\u2010Columbian treponemal disease has been found in Northern Asia (Harper et al., 2011). In some cases, sequencing ancient pathogen DNA has shed light on the history of microbes [e.g. confirming Yersinia pestis as the cause of the Black Death (Bos et al., 2011; Schuenemann et al., 2011)]. For a variety of reasons, including poor preservation over time and the absence of bacterial DNA in bone during late\u2010stage disease, it appears unlikely that we will be able to obtain T. pallidum DNA from affected skeletons (Bouwman and Brown, 2005; von Hunnius et al., 2007). Thus, the history of treponemal disease in the Old World remains ambiguous, despite a substantial effort to apply genetics to this problem. Genetics may never provide all the answers we would like concerning past human infections, though new technologies will certainly uncover important new information.",

What kind of changes might we expect agriculture to have wrought? Research shows that one of the most important influences upon the microbiomes of the mouth and gut is diet. The composition of the microbiome appears to be exquisitely sensitive to what we eat; for example, strains of Bacteroides plebius obtained from Japanese subjects frequently harbor a gene capable of degrading the porphyran in edible seaweed, while this gene is absent in North American strains (Hehemann et al., 2010). Both across species and within humans, the proportion of proteins, carbohydrates, and insoluble fiber in the diet is associated with the composition of the gut microflora (Muegge et al., 2011). Wu et al. (2005) have found that higher levels of protein and animal fats favor the dominance of certain bacterial groups, such as Bacteroides, while carbohydrates are associated with other bacterial groups, such as Prevotella. Thus, one might hypothesize that the increased carbohydrate levels associated with the advent of agriculture would have increased the proportion of Prevotella species in the microbiome while decreasing Bacteroides levels. In addition, a decrease in the variety of foods consumed may have resulted in a loss of microbiome diversity. And as humans and animals spent more time in close proximity, one might predict that their microbiomes would begin to resemble one another. Finally, as the high\u2010protein, high\u2010fat western diet has become more and more common worldwide, we might expect another set of dramatic changes in the microbiome, with Bacteroides again becoming more common.",

Agriculture has become so ensconced that there are few hunter\u2013gatherer groups left to study, making it difficult to establish the characteristics of a non\u2010agriculturalist microbiome. Moreover, the groups that do remain, such as the Spinifex of Australia and the Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands, have been able to maintain their lifestyle only because of their isolation, limiting opportunities for scientists to study their microflora. Finally, it is important to remember that modern hunter\u2013gatherers are not living fossils; it is possible that their microbiomes, even if sequenced, would differ from ancient hunter\u2013gatherer microbiomes in important ways. One study of a population that recently left their hunter\u2013gatherer past behind, the Batwa Pygmies of Uganda, found that they harbored a saliva microbiome significantly more diverse than those found in agriculturalists from Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Nasidze et al., 2011).

As predicted, studies have shown that non\u2010western diets are associated with increased levels of Prevotella and decreased levels of Bacteroides. For example, a comparison of upper middle class US children and children residing in a Dhaka slum found that the latter had gut flora enriched for Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Oscillospira and depleted in Bacteroides (Lin et al., 2013). Although less studied, the yeast composition of the gut may also change in response to diet. A study of a Wayampi community in the Amazon found that Candida albicans carriage, normal in western countries, was unusual, and that Wayampi individuals were colonized by yeast species only rarely observed in the West (Angebault et al., 2013). These observations may be due to differences in the yeast strains acquired via diet. In addition, numerous studies have shown that the western gut microbiome is significantly less diverse than the microbiome of non\u2010western populations in regions such as Dhaka (Lin et al., 2013), rural Malawi, and the Venezuelan Amazon (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Finally, the overall volume of the microbes carried appears to vary depending on diet. In high\u2010income nations, humans typically carry a gut microbiota that weighs less than 1.3 kg. However, in low\u2010income, rural nations, the gut microbiota typically weighs approximately 2 kg (Bengmark, 2000). Thus, the shift in diet associated with the second epidemiological transition appears to have shifted the composition of the gut flora in favor of Bacteroides, reduced gut flora diversity, and reduced the total mass of the gut microflora.",

In one study, which examined coprolites from the US, Chile, and Mexico (8,000\u20131,400 YBP), the first two samples did not bear a close resemblance to modern human gut microbiomes, possibly due to poor preservation (Tito et al., 2012). The Mexican sample was more informative; it was Prevotella\u2010rich and quite similar to modern samples obtained from rural Malawi and the Venezuela Amazon. Interestingly, Treponema species were found to be a significant component of this ancient Mexican sample as well as of microbiomes independently characterized in three modern, rural communities gathered from various continents (Tito et al., 2012). This suggests that Treponema may play an important role in the digestion of high\u2010fiber diets. The microbiome of \u00d6tzi, the Tyrolean Iceman, has also been analyzed via an intestinal coprolite, and its composition resembles that of modern African children (Tito et al., 2012). Curiously, it has been reported that the microbiome of an Austrian soldier, killed in 1918 and mummified on ice, resembles that of African children more than that of modern US adults as well (Tito et al., 2012).

In addition, phylogenetic diversity among modern plaque samples was significantly lower than that in Mesolithic or Neolithic samples, and the prevalence of cariogenic bacterial species, such as Streptococcus mutans, was elevated (Adler et al., 2013). Using a different approach, researchers have performed a genetic analysis of modern S. mutans strains and demonstrated that the demographics of this pathogen changed significantly around 10,000 YBP (Cornejo et al., 2013).

Agriculture has also had important indirect effects upon our microflora, ramifications that are still playing out in the continually rearranging makeup of the human microbiome. Agriculture facilitated a number of important changes. First, population size climbed and the nature of social interactions changed. Novel social groups, such as classmates and roller derby teams, developed and now serve as efficient social networks along which microbes travel (Meadow et al., 2013). Second, medical knowledge improved. Antibiotics were developed, for example. Studies have shown that although the microbiome quickly begins to recover after antibiotic use, the original microflora of the mouth and gut not restored weeks and even months after treatment ends (Dethlefsen and Relman, 2011; Lazarevic et al., 2013).",

Some of the most important determinants of the composition of an infant's gut microbiome include mode of delivery and type of feeding (Penders et al., 2006). Newborn infants are more or less germ\u2010free, but as soon as babies leave their mothers' bodies, this begins to change. While vaginally delivered babies develop microbiota that mirror their mother's vaginal microbiota, babies delivered via C\u2010section harbor microbiomes that resemble those found on the skin's surface (Dominguez\u2010Bello et al., 2010). Differences in the microflora linked to delivery mode persist even in seven\u2010year\u2010old children (Penders et al., 2006). In addition, babies who are delivered via C\u2010section or formula\u2010fed are more likely to harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile (Harmsen et al., 2000; Penders et al., 2006). And while Bifidobacterium strains dominate the guts of breastfed infants, Bacteroides are equally common in formula\u2010fed infants (Harmsen et al., 2000). Breastmilk even contains its own microbiome, which is itself influenced by whether a mother gives birth vaginally or via C\u2010section (Cabrera\u2010Rubio et al., 2012). Finally, a focus on hygiene means children are exposed to fewer microbes. Experiments in piglets indicate that limiting the microbial exposure of developing animals disrupts the normal maturation of the gut microbiota (Schmidt et al., 2011), and new variants of the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d posit that similar processes may help explain the rise in prevalence of certain human diseases, such as allergies and diabetes (Huffnagle, 2010; Musso et al., 2010; Rook, 2012).

Although the majority of people infected with H. pylori have no symptoms, this bacterium is the primary cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers worldwide and can eventually lead to gastric cancer (Graham et al., 1992; Fuccio et al., 2009).

As H. pylori infection has become less common, the incidence of allergies and autoimmune disorders has risen. A number of studies have shown that individuals infected with H. pylori have lower levels of allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disorders (Feeney et al., 2002; Chen and Blaser, 2007; Janson et al., 2007; Chen and Blaser, 2008; Reibman et al., 2008; Luther et al., 2010; Amberbir et al., 2011; Zevit et al., 2012). Moreover, although still controversial, it appears that H. pylori may protect against acid reflux (Nam et al., 2010) and, thus, Barrett's esophagus (Corley et al., 2008; Thrift et al., 2012) and esophageal cancer (Whiteman et al., 2010). As the incidence of H. pylori infection has fallen, esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has been increasing markedly in Western nations (Thrift and Whiteman, 2012). These examples emphasize that the complicated role of this bacterium in health and disease requires further study; some researchers believe that the current evidence draws into question the wisdom of eradicating H. pylori from the microflora (Blaser and Falkow, 2009). Neither completely friend nor foe, H. pylori's \u201cfrenemy\u201d status may characterize other microbes that have evolved with H. sapiens over millennia as well.

In order to estimate when an infection originated, investigators must typically use the molecular clock, but this valuable tool requires that a number of assumptions be met. The most important feature of the molecular clock is its calibration. We must have an accurate estimate for the rate at which nucleotide substitutions occur within the genomes we are studying; that is, we must know the rate at which the clock \u201cticks.\u201d As was discussed in the section on treponemal disease, calibration can be tricky. Estimates should come from a relevant species, and as we have learned in recent years, it is also important that they are obtained over a time period similar to the one of interest. Substitution rates that are estimated over shorter evolutionary time periods are significantly higher than those that accumulate between species over greater time periods, making the molecular clock time\u2010dependent (Ho et al., 2005). An example of the importance of calibration comes from research on Shigella, the bacterium responsible for dysentery. One early study used methods standard at the time to estimate divergence times for the various Shigella lineages and determined that they had emerged well before agriculture, which would make dysentery one of the early infectious diseases of humans (Pupo et al., 2000). However, a recent study, which used a combination of old and new isolates and paid special attention to molecular clock calibration, suggests that Shigella sonnei infection is a relatively recent phenomenon, having emerged within the last 500 years in Europe, from whence it expanded across the world (Holt et al., 2012).",

As more samples become available, our understanding of a pathogen's history may change rapidly. During the period 2009\u20132010, this occurred in the study of P. falciparum. As discussed, the ability to obtain DNA sequences from non\u2010invasive samples collected from NHPs revolutionized the field. A flurry of studies came out, as each sample expansion yielded new data. Researchers found closer genetic relatives to P. falciparum in NHPs than had ever been identified before. We rapidly learned that P. falciparum infection could be found in apes (Duval et al., 2010; Krief et al., 2010) and that human P. falciparum was the result of a zoonotic transfer rather than an heirloom pathogen (Rich et al., 2009).

Instead of simply viewing domestic animals as a source of infection, we have been forced to recognize that we represent an important source of infection for animals as well. We have also come to realize that many pathogens have infected us for much longer than was previously thought, most likely originating during the Paleolithic (Trueba and Dunthorn, 2012). For example, Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium responsible for whooping cough, has long been thought to be a recent acquisition in humans, a souvenir pathogen acquired from livestock.

Animal experiments indicate that gut bacteria can influence bodily functions that have nothing to do with digestion, playing roles in neurodevelopment, stress reactivity, and behavior (Foster and Neufeld, 2013). Diet, interactions with other species, population size, hygiene, and medical interventions have all changed as a result of our dependence on agriculture, and each of these factors has affected the microbiome. In other words, genetic studies of the microbiome have shown us that we have been missing the \u201cbig picture.\u201d We are beginning to flesh out the details, gaining a better understanding of the way these ecosystems function and change in response to the environment. Although this work is just beginning, it is possible that it will revolutionize the way that we practice medicine, and given the microbiome's influence on health, our model of epidemiological transitions should be broadened to include commensals and microbes that can both help and harm, as well as pathogens.",

However, these lessons translate into a better understanding of the epidemiological transition that we are currently undergoing, and better understanding may lead, in time, to more effective health interventions. Currently, we are experiencing the third epidemiological transition, which succeeds Omran's \u201cAge of Degenerative and Man\u2010Made Diseases.\u201d Although chronic diseases are still a major source of morbidity and mortality, we are now battling the failure of antimicrobials and the rapid spread of novel infections, such as West Nile virus, along global networks (Harper and Armelagos, 2010). In addition, pathogens are being pinpointed as the causes of diseases, such as peptic ulcers and cervical cancer that remained, until recently, poorly understood, further increasing the amount of damage that can be attributed to microbes (Lipkin, 2013). Understanding pathogen transmission and evolution as well as the microbial ecology of our bodies is as important as ever.",

In the last century, rare transfer events have resulted in human infections that have swept the globe, including HIV, SARS, and the 1918 flu. Even after controlling for reporting bias, the number of emerging infectious diseases appears to be increasing, and zoonoses dominate recent lists (Jones et al., 2008). As a result, methods of pathogen discovery and surveillance are continually being developed and improved (Lipkin, 2013), although much of this effort may be aimed at the regions least likely to host important emerging disease events (Jones et al., 2008). By learning more about the places, species, and interactions that characterize such events, hopefully we will be able to better target resources to the regions where they are most likely to occur. The history of agriculture and pathogens is rich with information about scenarios in which host switches to humans have occurred (Table 2). Alternately, we can mine this history for scenarios in which pathogens jumped from humans to nearby species, which may have important implications for conservation and livestock management. Finally, we may be able to apply the methods developed studying pathogen cross\u2010species transfer events to better understand the exchange of non\u2010pathogenic microbes between species. Future research should focus on areas where activities such as agriculture are changing patterns of contact between humans and animals. Increased sampling, sophisticated methods of microbial identification, and thorough genetic characterization will help us better understand when, where, and how microbes shift hosts.",

That antibiotics are problematic has become clear. Antibiotic resistance is continually growing, and extremely drug resistant strains of tuberculosis (often paired with HIV), Acinetobacter baumannii (found in intensive care units), Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumonia, and other bacteria are increasingly common and very difficult to treat (Gandhi et al., 2006; Park et al., 2009; Jacobsen et al., 2010; Frasson et al., 2012; Hendricksen et al., 2013). Even when they work, the effect of antibiotics upon the entire microbiome is undesirable. As a result, alternatives to antibiotics, such as probiotics and phage therapy, are looking more and more appealing. There is still a long way to go before these therapies represent viable options for most infections, and our current regulatory system is not currently equipped to deal efficiently with approvals for these treatments. Nevertheless, preliminary studies of options such as fecal transplants to cure C. difficile (van Nood et al., 2013) and bacteriophage to treat drug\u2010resistant ear infections (Wright et al., 2009) are encouraging, and it is likely that antibiotic alternatives will be used more and more in the future. Will our understanding of the effects of the Western diet upon our microflora prove useful? Can pre\u2010agricultural microbial communities serve as guides, providing a model composition to which we should aim to return? Which changes to the microbiome are essential adaptations to modern life, and which represent deleterious outcomes that must be fixed? These are important questions that remain to be answered.",

            "text": "The price of genetic sequencing has fallen dramatically. Meanwhile, our ability to sequence DNA from non\u2010optimal samples has improved by leaps and bounds: we have sequenced the Y. pestis genome from Medieval teeth (Bos et al., 2011), the P. falciparum genome from NHP feces (Liu et al., 2010), and the Neandertal (Green et al., 2010) and Denisova (Meyer et al., 2012) genomes from ancient bone fragments. The scope of our interest has grown ever broader, as we explore the microbiota inhabiting permafrost, deep\u2010sea vents, and our armpits. There are now large\u2010scale services that will genotype an individual for $99 (23andme) and characterize his or her microbiome for even less (uBiome). Soon such projects are likely to yield whole genome sequence data. As we sequence more and more samples from more and more places, we are likely to gain a better understanding of the history of the microbes within and around us\u2014and the role that agriculture has played in shaping these communities. A robust framework for understanding this influx of data will be needed. Well\u2010developed concepts such as the epidemiological transition model and Sprent's heirloom and souvenir classification system, are likely to prove useful in this capacity. These models should be broadened to include important non\u2010pathogens; recent research makes it clear that the distinction between pathogens and commensals is not a clear one and that non\u2010pathogenic microbes have a large effect on health in their own right. A dialectical process in which our models are refined in the light of newly available sequence data and novel genetic information is processed through the lens of these conceptual frameworks may eventually help us 1) craft better interventions, ridding ourselves of problematic microbes without devastating entire ecosystems and 2) aid in preventing disastrous interspecies pathogen transfers. It is important to recognize that the effect of agriculture upon the human microbiome is still unfolding, with tainted meat, farm animals, and produce spreading E. coli 0157, mad cow disease, influenza, antibiotic\u2010resistant infections, and Rift Valley fever (Lipkin, 2013) and individuals converting to the Western microbiome as highfat, highsugar, agriculture\u2010based diets spread. This is an exhilarating time for scientists, as each passing year brings fascinating, and sometimes startling, insights into the history of our microbe\u2010scape. It will be exciting to see how knowledge of our shared past with microbes shapes future interactions between us and them, especially as we have come to realize that the distinction between \u201cour\u201d cells and \u201ctheirs\u201d is often blurry.",
