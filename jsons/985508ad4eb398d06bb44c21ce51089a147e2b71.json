For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. Accordingly, we propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model -the \"Rippled Newsvendor\" -with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and \"wear-and-tear\" (i.e system breakdown).",

Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways.

This process from raw materials to end consumer looks very different today than just 30 years ago. Today, a typical supply network spans across multiple continents, often operating on 24-hour continuous cycles, all the while intermingling natural, social, economic, and geo-political environments into one cohesive operation. Given just how interconnected modern supply networks are, it is no surprise that these supply networks are at a heightened risk of disruption. Various events across the globe impact the firm's ability to effectively match its supply with the demand. More recently, we can see clear examples of these risks leading to disruptions in the network such as attacks on oil supply (Turak and Ellyatt, 2019), the implementation of tariffs (Wursthorn, 2019) , the call for labor strikes (Ip, 2019) , and even the discovery of important social issues such as human rights violations (Smith, 2019) .",

First, supply chain risk management is an inherently subjective process, since what one may consider \"risky\", another may not. This is due to the firm's perception of the environment within which they operate (Ellis et al., 2011; DuHadway et al., 2018; . It can equally be argued that \"risk\" is measured in various ways, many of which are dependent on the decision maker's preferences and perceptions (Garvey et al., 2015; Zsidisin and Ritchie, 2009) . While one may view the minimization of \"risk\" by minimizing expected cost, another may prefer to instead minimize total spread of risk (i.e. severity). This is simply a matter of preference. A second reason why supply chain risk severity is an important consideration to be studied, is because of the potential financial consequences that the total spread of disruption may have on the focal firm as well as the supply chain (Craighead et al., 2007) .",

We henceforth construct a simulation study to better understand the optimal nature of our inventory-production system. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we review the relevant literature on supply chain disruption and risk, the ripple effect and risk propagation, supply chain risk severity, and the fundamentals of Bayesian Networks. Next, we describe our \"Rippled Newsvendor\" model by first showing how supply chain severity can be analytically modeled leveraging concepts from Bayesian Networks, Models of The Ripple Effect, and Supply Chain Risk Propagation. We then conduct three numerical experiments by simulating various risk structures in a simple linear supply chain so as to implement and approximate, as well as better understand, the \"Rippled Newsvendor\" model. Last, we discuss our findings, the relevant managerial implications, our limitations, and avenues for future research.",

Due to the proliferation of global sourcing and the level of perceived importance from practitioners (Craighead et al., 2007) , academics have given special attention to understanding the various ontologies and methods of analysis to study SCDs. The extant literature on the matter has found that SCDs have a significant impact on a firm's manufacturing and inventory performance (Tomlin, 2006) . As such, some have proposed a general managerial process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating against supply chain disruptions (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005) . Some of the proposed frameworks for designing mitigation strategies include (but are not limited to) the use of primary suppliers, pre-positioned warehouses, or dual sourcing (Yang et al., 2012) .

            "text": "While many authors in the supply chain risk management literature have greatly expanded our understanding of the nature of risk, most of this research is limited within the boundaries or horizon of the firm (Garvey et al., 2015) . There is currently a need for supply chain scholars to look \"beyond the horizon\" so as to better understand how various externalities impact strategic and tactical policy at the focal firm level (Carter et al., 2015) . Early work in supply chain disruptions suggested how to model the events beyond the horizon of the focal firm (Craighead et al., 2007) . For example, Li et al. (2010b) proposed a model to study supplier selection in centralized and decentralized supply chain systems. Schmitt and Singh (2012) studied the resilience of supply networks under disruptions at multiple echelons in the network. The idea of interconnections between events was proposed by Blackhurst et al. (2005) , who suggested the use of Petri-Nets in a reachability analysis to determine which specific areas of the network can be affected by a supply chain disruption. 6 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f One of the most important contributions in this body of the literature has been the formalization of supply chain disruption propagation by Ivanov et al. (2014) , who suggested that such disruption propagation should be termed the \"ripple effect\", which is a generalized version of the bullwhip effect. Through a series of papers, the ripple effect has been studied with respect to several decisions, measurements, analysis methods, and phenomena, including but not limited to distribution (Ivanov et al., 2015) , recovery and resilience (Ivanov et al., 2016) , performance measurement (Sokolov et al., 2016) , reverse logistics (Ivanov et al., 2017b) , and simulation methods (Ivanov, 2017) . The common element in this body of work has been how one element on the supply chain is \"connected\" to another element of the supply chain. For example, Hosseini et al. (2019b) used dynamic Bayesian networks with integrated Markov chains to study and quantify the ripple effect. Extending off of this notion, research has also uncovered optimal strategies for supplier selection and optimal order allocation (Hosseini et al., 2019c) . Recent work has also incorporated disruption and recovery considerations into supply chain risk assessments using the ripple effect, developing new measures to identify high-risk suppliers (Hosseini and Ivanov, 2019) . The concept of disruption in this literature is not isolated to study at a single location, but rather, to multiple locations and firms; primarily driven by the structure of the network (Hosseini et al., 2019a) .",

Unlike disruption propagation, where the potential sequence of disruption is solely dependent on the structure of the supply network, risk propagation is more general and describes non-structural as well as structural related events that can lead to disruptions, ripple effects, or other risk propagations. Risk propagation is the sequence of inter-dependent risks in the supply network which may or may not lead to a disruption or ripple effect. Risk propagation is often modeled using conditional probability theory (Garvey et al., 2015) by trying to ascertain which events within and outside the firm will lead to a disruption (such as weather, labor strikes, tariffs, etc). Some preliminary work in this body of literature exists.",

A more thorough review is conducted in Heckerman (1998) as well as Ojha et al. (2018) . Bayesianism rests on the general principle that probability is inherently a subjective belief regarding an event that one holds, measured on a 0 to 1 scale (0 being not likely, 1 being certain). The idea is that every individual has a collection of observations and concepts often referred to as knowledge. This knowledge, often represented as \u03be, represents all the beliefs that one has about the world surrounding them, and is often referred to as a priori knowledge, or prior belief (Heckerman, 1998) . This is commonly modeled with the use of conditional probability. Conditional probability transcends the concept of belief updating. For example, if X represents the amount of income we will earn next year, then an individual initially holds a belief that X will be equal to a with a value of belief P (X = a | \u03be). When an individual observes a new event e, say, such as a new boss entering the company, this belief is then updated to a posterior belief, namely P (X = a | \u03be, e). To compute this, the standard definition of conditional probability is often employed:",

The Risk Graph G R = N R \u222a E R is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes, which represent binary random variables (which themselves represent risks of disruption), of whose dependencies are determined based on if the risks lie within the same location of the supply network S, or, if the locations of where the risks lie are neighbors of each other in the supply network S, and if the risks are causally related, as determined by some form of \"analyst\".

This allows for an interesting and more realistic trade-off, between ordering too much and ordering too little. In order to minimize the severity (i.e. risk propagation), we need to satisfy demand in full, and so we will naturally need to produce or hold more in inventory. However, as we increase our production and/or inventory levels, the conditional probability of \"disruption\" increases as a result of the machines or inventory storage experiencing increased levels of \"wear and tear\". This increased level of wear and tear may lead to a breakdown of the system, and hence, a supply chain disruption. Therefore, the natural trade-off in the Rippled Newsvendor Model is between the ability to meet demand and the ability to not cause a total breakdown of the machine or inventory system, all of which is subject to both exogenous and endogenous risk of disruption.",

Since we are assuming for our base model that the conditional probabilities between the events are the same across all firms, we can standardize some of our notation Recall that firm f 1 is the bottom most firm.

In the first case, it is assumed that no exogenous risk has manifested (E 1 = 0), no production risk has manifested (R 1 = 0), and no inventory risk has manifested (V 1 = 0). However, we can still observe a disruption if it so happens that our decisions were insufficient to cover demand (D > P 1 + I 1 ).

Thus, we have P (C = 1|E 1 = 0, R 1 = 1, V 1 = 1) = 1. By similar reasoning presented previously, when both inventory 22 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof and production are disrupted, it does not matter if there is an exogenous event, since we already will know, in this instance, that there will be a disruption. Hence, we also will have P (C = 1|E 1 = 1, R 1 = 1, V 1 = 1) = 1. Now if we do have an exogenous event occur (E 1 = 1), then the chances of our demand fulfillment being satisfied could be attributable to either the exogenous event or the event that occurs with production and inventory. If there is only an exogenous event, but there is no disruption to inventory or production, we need to specify the probability of a disruption at demand fulfillment, which we denote as p e . We assume this is the same for all firms in the chain for all of their exogenous events. If we have inventory disrupted (V 1 = 1), then the probability of this impacting the demand is based on either the exogenous event impacting all of the demand, or, it does not impact demand but there is insufficient production to satisfy demand. Put differently, the demand cannot be fulfilled if the exogenous event \"trickled down\" to the demand fulfillment, or if D > P 1 . For the sake of parsimony, we assume these two events are independent (the exogenous event does not impact the ability to satisfy demand with production if production is not disrupted, and likewise, the ability to satisfy demand with production does not impact an exogenous event). Hence, we have P (C = 1|E 1 = 1, R 1 = 0, V 1 = 1) = P (Ex Trickle or D > P 1 ) = P (Ex Trickle) + P (D > P 1 ) \u2212 P (Ex Trickle)P (D > P 1 ) = p e + P (D > P 1 ) \u2212 p e P (D > P 1 ) By similar reasoning and assumptions with inventory, we should have: P (C = 1|E 1 = 1, R 1 = 1, V 1 = 0) = P (Ex Trickle or D > I 1 ) = P (Ex Trickle) + P (D > I 1 ) \u2212 P (Ex Trickle)P (D > I 1 )",

Hence, the parents for the risk of disruption to production in firm f 1 would be E 1 , R 2 , and V 2 . Notice, however, that these are similar risks to what we studied in our previous conditional probability table. Therefore, we can apply much of the same logic here as we did there so as to obtain the following CPT, with some slight alterations. First, since the decision variables are known, we have no need for a probability distribution on them. However, the outcome of a disruption manifesting as a result of insufficient production or inventory is easier to characterize with an indicator function to indicate if a disruption \"trickles down\" as a result of insufficient supply.

Taking into account the fact that relative variation will depend on the value of the mean, and that the variance of the Poisson distribution is equal to the mean, we also varied the standard deviation of the normal distribution so that the coefficient of variation was the same as in our base model (namely, that of 0.2).

First, for each model generated in Experiment 2, we kept all decisions and parameters fixed at the optimal value as determined by the genetic algorithm.

To do so, we generated a vector of percentages, ranging by every 5%, from -100% to 100%. Each new value of the chosen parameter was then generated by multiplying a factor (which was the percentage plus 1) by the value of that parameter at the optimal solution.

From experiment 1, we can see that the objective function exhibits convexity properties. This should be expected due to the construction of our model, as well as involving the trade-off between disrupting due to not ordering enough, and disrupting due to over-production. The plots convey the idea that when ordering quantities are too high, or if inventory quantities are too high, the risk severity is higher.

We also notice that severity is lower when firms produce more than what is ordered, but not too much so as to lead to a disruption in production. The shape of the objective function, however, differs for decisions mixed with inventory rather 39 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f than those with production. We notice that in the plots with production and inventory, there is a trade-off (higher production necessitates lower inventory, and vice versa). While in the plots with only production between the firms, we notice that such a trade-off has less of an effect on the severity. Overall, however, the biggest take-away from our plots is the convex nature of the objective function, which may indicate that optimal solutions do exist for our model, and reflect the trade-off between producing too little or too much so as to minimize severity.",

This result is congruent with the extant literature which suggests that the complexity of the supply network structure is related to the level of severity (Schmitt et al., 2017) . We further emphasize the reasoning for this with two primary explanations with respect to our study. First, the structure of the supply chain is itself linear, and so the number of \"paths\" for risk to \"flow\" is greatly reduced in our risk graph than if we were to have a more complex network. Second, all of our parameters remained fixed, and the probabilities of disruption were fairly low. However, if this result holds in general, we can conclude that firms may want to seek more linear structures (single suppliers), as this would naturally help reduce the number of events that could occur.",

However, this can be explained due to our simplifying assumption of equal inventories across all firms. With respect to the probabilities of disruption, we can see that the probability of the manifestation of an exogenous event at a firm when no exogenous event has manifested at the firm's supplier is the most sensitive of our parameters. This is in line with our earlier observation of this probability having the most impact on the optimal severity in the network.

Our model can be considered an extension of this idea. More appropriately, the Rippled Newsvendor can be viewed as the precursor to various ripple effects, and how the presence of various risks eventually lead to the disruption propagation itself.

As far as we are aware, this is the first major study to clarify and measure the construct of risk severity through the lens of risk propagation and the ripple effect. We further argue, given our construction, that risk severity is more of a risk propagation construct than it is a risk or disruption construct. One way to view risk severity is as a more generalized version of service level. Put differently, we argue severity is a construct that represents the network's generalized service level, rather than individual firm-specific levels.",

Additionally, managers need to have the appropriate management of exogenous events. This of course has been emphasized in the prior literature through proper risk management methodologies, namely that of identification, assessment, and mitigation (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005) , or the detection, Our results, however, indicate that managers should focus more of their attention on control or mitigation of exogenous events that directly impact their own firm, and spend less of an effort and resources on mitigating the propagation of exogenous risk from a supplier to an exogenous risk of the firm itself.",

Last, if the firm is in a linear structure (which we contend is not a very realistic assumption), they should aim to contract with suppliers that have longer chains. This may seem counter intuitive, since longer chains may expose the firm to more susceptibility of risk. However, our results indicate that when the firm has a single supplier, and suppliers subsequent to them also have single suppliers, when the chain is longer, the average severity is lower. The reasoning behind this observation is simple. Chains can stop disruptions in their path due to the simplicity of the structure, while networks allow for other paths for the disruption to propagate (Kim et al., 2011) . If the supply chain structure is a pure linear structure, and one of the firms exposed to the risk managed to mitigate it, it is less likely for the disruption to continue downstream. The only other way in which a disruption can occur in a firm lower than the firm that mitigated the disruption would be due to (1) pure coincidence or (2) due to some unknown path of causality, as we argued above.",

This observation underscores the importance to distinguish between firm performance and risk severity as well as how risk propagation impacts both. While others in the literature have suggested that there is a greater impact to firm performance due to endogenous risks when compared to exogenous risks (DuHadway and Carnovale, 2019), our results indicate that there is no such difference in magnitude to severity. Rather, there is a distinction of magnitude of impact based on whether the risk had manifested within a firm's boundaries (yet, the risk itself still being considered as \"exogenous\") or from outside. Our results indicate that severity is greater when risk emanates within the firm's boundaries rather than from outside. Hence, our results can be considered as an extension of the extant literature with respect to the consequences of endogenous/exogenous risk and disruption.",
