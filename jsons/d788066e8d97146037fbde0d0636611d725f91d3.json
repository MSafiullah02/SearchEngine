The predominant visceral macroscopic changes in fatal SARS-CoV cases have been edematous lungs with increased gross weights and multiple areas of congestion, enlargement of lymph nodes in the pulmonary hila and the abdominal cavity, as well as a diminished spleen size and reduced spleen weights. 7, 8 Morphological changes were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. 7 The histological feature in the early phase of pulmonary SARS-CoV infections is commonly associated with acute diffuse alveolar damage, while later phases of the disease demonstrate a combination of diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. 9 Large numbers of SARS-CoV particles and genomic sequences were detected within circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the intestinal mucosa, the epithelium of renal distal tubules, neurons in the brain, and tissue-resident macrophages residing in different organs. 10 Co-localization of SARS-CoV RNA and cellular cytokeratins within the lung was evident by immunofluorescent in situ hybridization, suggesting that pneumocytes become infected. 11 Accordingly, electron microscopic examinations also showed SARS-CoV virions and nucleocapsid inclusions in pneumocytes. 12 Additionally, SARS-CoV may occasionally be identified in the alveolar macrophages of the lung. 12 ",

Extensive lung damage in SARS-CoV-infected patients appears to be associated with high initial virus titers, 13 increased monocyte, macrophage, and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs, 7 and elevated levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 14 High serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, Interferon \u03b3 [IFN-\u03b3], and transforming growth factor-\u03b2) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-8) were found in patients with SARS with severe disease compared to individuals with uncomplicated SARS. 14, [16] [17] [18] In addition, the early induction of CXCL10 and IL-2, as well as the subsequent hyperproduction of IL-6 with a coinciding lack of IL-10 production are thought to contribute to the immuno-pathological processes involved in lung injury during SARS-CoV infection. 17 Additionally, robust and persistent expression of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b3 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) accompanied early SARS sequelae. 19 It has also been shown that SARS-CoV infections result in a delayed expression of type I IFN. 20 The delayed-type I IFN signaling, which was accompanied with robust virus replication, was found to promote the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte/ macrophages, resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus-specific T cell responses. 21 ",

            "text": "December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported by the local health facilities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1 In early January 2020, the causative agent of mysterious pneumonia has been identified as a novel coronavirus by several independent laboratories located in China. The causative virus has been temporarily named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization. 2 According to the daily report of the World Health Organization, the epidemic of 2019-nCoV so far caused 45,171 laboratory confirmed cases and 1114 death in China, as well as 441 confirmed cases and 1 death in 24 other countries by 12th February 2020. Coronaviruses are distributed broadly among humans and animals and cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. So far, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. Preceding the 2019-nCoV epidemic, the 21st century has already seen outbreaks caused by two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These outbreaks result from zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier and causing high morbidity and mortality in human populations. 3,4 The 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV show several similarities regarding the clinical presentations, which can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome. 5,6 Therefore, our current knowledge of the biology and pathology of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may provide clues for ongoing and future research efforts concerning the investigation of the 2019-nCoV. In this review, we try to apply our current understanding of the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV for the characterization of 2019-nCoV.",

However, the field is rapidly moving forward. Nevertheless, findings from several reports await independent confirmation and have to be regarded with precautions. The genome of 2019-nCov was sequenced very early during the outbreak. 5 This enabled rapid development of point-of-care real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests specific for 2019-nCoV.",
