Filamentous virions are 55 nm to 85 nm in diameter and can reach up to 1 \u03bcm in length. Virions have spikes at the surface ~7\u201310 nm long, which make their surface look \u201cfuzzy\u201d in ultrathin sections. They contain a helically packed nucleocapsid which in cross-sections looks like tubules ~10 nm in diameter with ~15 nm periodicity. At earlier stages of infection, cells can contain intracytosolic inclusions consisting of nucleocapsid strands 10 nm to 15 nm in diameter (Figure 1B).",

Virions bud from host cell membranes either from the plasmalemma into extracellular space (Figure 2A,B) or into intracellular vacuoles of varying sizes (Figure 2C,D). Inside vacuoles, virions can be packed in stacks of up to 1 \u00b5m (Figure 2D). Some rhabdoviruses, especially in animal models, form intracytoplasmic inclusions consisting of nucleoprotein, sometimes with intravacuolar virions [16].

Immature virions are larger in size (~60 nm) and are located inside the cisterns of granular endoplasmic reticulum within infected cells (Figure 5). Replicating flaviviruses induce formation of characteristic intracytoplasmic membraneous structures: convoluted membranes (Figure 5C), paracrystalline arrays and smooth membrane structures (SMS) within usually expanded cisterns of granular endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 5A,B), visible in conventional (epoxy plastic-embedded) ultrathin sections, or vesicle packets in ultrathin cryo-sections [60]. These structures apparently are connected with each other and the membrane system of the cell (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) and serve as sites of virus RNA replication and processing thus representing flavivirus replication complexes [61,62]. The presence of even one of these structures can serve as an identifier of an infection of the cell with a flavivirus. SMS can be spherical, 50\u201365 nm in diameter, or slightly elongated (Figure 5A,B) but in some viruses they can be extremely long, up to 2 \u03bcm (Figure 5D).",

Family Reoviridae includes two subfamilies, Spinareovirinae and Sedoreovirinae, according to morphology of virion surface which can be visualized in negatively stained preparations of purified viruses. Virions of viruses assigned to the Spinareovirinae have short flat spikes or turrets. In Fako virus (unassigned; probable genus Dinovernavirus), recently isolated from mosquitoes in Cameroon [29], these turrets are ~7 nm tall and ~15 nm wide (Figure 6A). In the Sedoreovirinae, virions are devoid of spikes but can display round surface capsomere subunits ~7 nm in diameter (Figure 6B). Reoviruses reproduce in cytoplasmic inclusions \u2013 virus factories, or viroplasms which appear in ultrathin sections as medium density masses composed of fine fibrils and granules and containing virus particles of different stages of maturity and empty shells (Figure 6C,D and Figure 7A). In coltiviruses (genus Coltivirus) and orbiviruses (genus Orbivirus), virus factories are often associated with randomly distributed fibrils and/or microtubules as demonstrated by F.A. Murphy [58,63].",

Alphavirus replication complexes are associated with specific vesicles - spherules formed as invaginations of either plasma membrane (in vertebrate cells), [64] or limiting membranes of endosomes (occasionally in vertebrate but mostly in mosquito cells) [65,66]. These spherule-loaded endosomes (and/or lysosomes) are termed \u201ctype 1 cytopathic vacuoles\u201d [67] and are very characteristic for alphavirus infection (Figure 7D) although recently they have been encountered in negevirus-infected C6/36 mosquito cells (Figure 8D). Alphavirus dense nucleocapsid cores ~40 nm in diameter can accumulate around cytopathic vacuoles [64] and can be found in the cytoplasm close to plasma membrane (Figure 7C, arrows). Alphavirus virions form by budding from the plasma membrane and can form paracrystalline arrays at the cell surface (Figure 7C). Electron microscopy was instrumental in the recent discovery of the insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat virus (Figure 10B,C), which cannot replicate in mammalian cells [68], allowing it to serve as a safe platform for vaccine development [69,70].",

Some infected cells had intravacuolar paracrystalline arrays consisting of empty and full virus particles but with less electron density than mature virions.

            "text": "Insect-specific viruses isolated recently from mosquitoes and phlebotomine sandflies have been characterized and proposed to represent a new genus (Negevirus) related to genera of mite-infecting plant viruses (Blunervirus, Cilevirus, and Higrevirus) in the new family Kitaviridae [49,73], or novel members of Entomobirnavirus, family Birnaviridae (Figure 10D). They appear to be very common and widespread in insect populations on different continents as isolates have been obtained from pools of mosquitoes and sandflies collected in Israel, North and South America, Africa, and Indonesia. In negatively stained preparations of Piura virus, isolated from Culex sp. mosquitoes in Peru, spherical particles with diameters of ~45 nm and ~55 nm were found. The striking feature of negevirus infection of C6/36 mosquito cells are the cytopathic effects \u2013 enormous expansions of perinuclear space \u2013 a granular endoplasmic reticulum system which becomes filled with vesicles and/or microtubules (Figure 8C, Figure 9A,B andFigure 10A). They have a diameter of 20\u201325 nm but can be of different lengths. The shortest can resemble a rice grain in morphology and can be arranged in rosettes in cross-sections of ER. Others can be very long, reaching up to several micrometers (Figure 8C and Figure 9A,B). Expanded perinuclear space can occupy almost the whole cytoplasm of the cell. Some negeviruses cause long protrusions of the nucleus and deep invaginations of perinuclear membranes leading to the fragmentation of the nucleus (Figure 9B). Another peculiarity of negevirus infection of C6/36 cells is the formation of cytopathic vacuoles with spherule-like structures 45\u201355 nm in diameter at the inner periphery of their limiting membrane (Figure 8C,D). These vacuoles can reach 1.4 \u00b5m in diameter and are morphologically similar to type 1 cytopathic vacuoles in alphaviruses. They have been found in all 10 described negeviruses [49] and later in many others that have not yet been fully characterized. Their role in negevirus replication is not known.",

Three viruses have also been observed to infect the same culture: Bontag Baru virus (unclassified; probable genus Alphamesonivirus), an unknown flavivirus and an unknown rhabdovirus, the latter budding into an ER cistern occupied by a flavivirus virion. It is most likely that these viruses originate from different individual mosquitoes in the pool, but the possibility of a co-infection of one mosquito with several different viruses cannot be excluded.",
