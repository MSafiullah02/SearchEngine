            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). To date, no antiviral drug has been approved to treat EV71 infection. Due to the essential role that EV71 3 C protease (3C pro ) plays in the viral life cycle, it is generally considered as a highly appealing target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we present a transgene-encoded biosensor that can accurately, sensitively and quantitatively report the proteolytic activity of EV71 3C pro . This biosensor is based on the catalyzed activity of a pro-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-enterovirus 3C pro cleavage site-Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) fusion protein that we named i-3CS-GLuc. GLuc enzyme is inactive in the fusion protein because of aggregation caused by pro-IL-1\u03b2. However, the 3C pro of EV71 and other enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus can recognize and process the canonical enterovirus 3C pro cleavage site between pro-IL-1\u03b2 and GLuc, thereby releasing and activating GLuc and resulting in increased luciferase activity. The high sensitivity, ease of use, and applicability as a transgene in cell-based assays of i-3CS-GLuc biosensor make it a powerful tool for studying viral protease proteolytic events in living cells and for achieving high-throughput screening of antiviral agents.",

As shown in Fig. 2C , with or without EV71 3C pro , the negative control iGLuc generated similar bioluminescence of (3.06 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10 5 and (3.20 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10 5 (N = 3) in HEK293T cells. In contrast, when we co-expressed EV71 3C pro with our biosensors, which led to the cleavage of fusion proteins, bioluminescence increased significantly. For i-3CS-GLuc1, the signal increased from (2.82 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10 5 to (7.04 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10 5 (N = 3) in the presence of EV71 3C pro . For i-3CS-GLuc2, a more significant increase of GLuc signal from (2.92 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 5 to (25.71 \u00b1 0.34) \u00d7 10 5 (N = 3) was measured. These results indicate that EV71 3C pro -mediated cleavage relieved the suppression of GLuc catalytic activity by pro-IL-1\u03b2 in both biosensors. Thus, both biosensors can monitor the activity of EV71 3C pro . However, the i-3CS-GLuc2 construct showed a higher sensitivity and signal to background ratio (SBR). Because no identified conformation analysis result was available for full length mouse pro-IL-1\u03b2 or GLuc, the conformation of i-3CS-GLuc constructs were predicted by I-TASSER server mainly based on homology to mature human IL-1\u03b2 using default parameter [22] [23] [24] . As shown in the top predicted models (Fig. S2) , the 3C pro cleavage site in i-3CS-GLuc2 is exposed on the surface, whereas the 3C pro cleavage site in i-3CS-Gluc1 is partially surrounded by other domains of i-3CS-Gluc1, which may prevent the access of 3C pro . Since the threading templates used for prediction has only 33% coverage of the full length of i-3CS-GLuc proteins, the quality of predicted models is low Figure 1 . Working principle of the luciferase-based biosensor for EV71 3C pro activity. The biosensor i-3CS-GLuc consists of mouse pro-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, an EV71 3C protease cleavage site and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) lacking N-terminal secretion signal peptide. In living cells, GLuc activity is suppressed by protein aggregation caused by pro-IL-1\u03b2. EV71 3C pro can recognize and process the cleavage site between pro-IL-1\u03b2 and GLuc, thus releasing and activating the GLuc enzyme.",

In 2013, scientists found that Rupintrivir also functions as a high-affinity inhibitor of EV71 3C pro 27 . Thus, we used Rupintrivir to determine whether our biosensor could be used to measure the inhibition of EV71 3C pro . To test whether Rupintrivir is toxic to human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cells, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed. Rupintrivir at concentrations from 25 nM to 2 \u03bcM showed no obvious toxicity to HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A) . In the absence of Rupintrivir, EV71 3 C pro cleaved and activated the biosensor i-3CS-GLuc2 to increase the GLuc signal from (4.07 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10 5 to (44.40 \u00b1 4.49) \u00d7 10 5 (N = 3), with a SBR of 10.92 (Fig. 3C) . However, upon treatment with 1 \u03bcM of Rupintrivir, EV71 3C pro only led to a slight increase in signal from (4.42 \u00b1 0.58) \u00d7 10 5 to (5.16 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 10 5 (N = 3), with an SBR of 1.17.

The assay data of representative samples were shown in Fig. 5F . According to the formula described in the previous research 28 , Z factor was calculated to be 0.62, indicating our system could provide excellent HTS assays (1 > Z > 0.5) 28 . 29 and was used to validate an EV71 3C pro -dependent bioluminescence imaging assay for anti-viral screening in a previous study 30 . Herein, GW5074 was selected to further validate the efficiency of HEK293T-i-3CS-GLuc2 cells for screening anti-EV71 agents. First, the cytotoxicity of GW5074 on HEK293T cells was tested using CCK-8 assays. Treatment with GW5074 up to 20 \u03bcM showed no significant influence on cell viability (Fig. S3) . To assess the anti-EV71 effects of GW5074, HEK293T-i-3CS-GLuc2 cells were infected with the EV71 BrCr-TR strain at an MOI of 4 and treated with different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcM) of GW5074. As shown in Fig. S4 , obvious CPEs were observed at 24 h post infection without GW5074 treatment, whereas the CPEs in the cells treated with GW5074 were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. To assess the anti-EV71 effect of GW5074 using the i-3CS-GLuc2 biosensor, GLuc bioluminescence was measured 24 hours after infection. As shown in Fig. 6A , treatment with GW5074 significantly decreased the resulting bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, WB assays showed that GW5074 treatment decreased EV71 VP1 expression (Fig. 5B) and RT-qPCR assay showed that GW5074 treatment decreased the EV71 VP1 mRNA level (Fig. 5C) . The viral TCID 50 was also decreased by GW5074 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D) . The consistency of these experiments further indicates that HEK293T-i-3CS-GLuc2 cells could be used for antiviral drugs screening. In the Enterovirus family, some viruses share the same 3C pro cleavage site. Thus theoretically, the i-3CS-GLuc biosensor could be used for some other enteroviruses whose 3C pro can recognize the EALFQ\u2193GPPK site. To test this possibility, the CVA9 Griggs strain, the CVB3 Nancy strain and the poliovirus vaccine strain Sabin 3 were used to infect HEK293T-i-3CS-GLuc2 cells at an MOI of 0.5. At 24 hours post infection, cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 7 , all three viruses activated GLuc and increased bioluminescence. The SBRs of CVA9, CVB3, and poliovirus infection were 3.60, 3.36 and 4.45 (three replicates each), indicating that the biosensor is also effective for mearing 3 C pro activity in other viruses of the Enterovirus family.",

Briefly, peptides bearing protease cleavage sites and FRET donor-receptor pairs were used as substrates for in vitro purified proteases to analysis their activity. FRET signals were activated when cleavage of peptides separated the fluorescent donor from the acceptor. This strategy has been applied to multiple viral proteases for inhibitor screening, including NS2B-NS3 of West Nile Virus 32 and 3C or 3C-like protease of Picornaviruses, Noroviruses, and Coronaviruses 33 . However, in vitro assays are often unable to reliably reflect the actual cleavage events that occur in complex milieus such as living cells and animals. In this study, both the biosensor and the reporter cell line allowed the monitoring of viral protease activity in living cells instead of in vitro. Numerous reports have demonstrated that the GLuc reporter can be used in small animal models as a marker to monitor different in vivo biological events such as tumor growth and proliferation, viral infection and replication as well as cell circulation [34] [35] [36] . Thus theoretically, our biosensor could also be used in animal models to monitor viral protease activity.",

The sensor protein should be expressed in the same intracellular location with the viral protease to ensure it could be cleaved to generated active GLuc. In our case, both proteins were expressed in the cytosol. But some viral proteases may localize to different subcellular structures, for example, dengue virus NS2B-NS3 is bound to the ER membrane.
