According to different antigenic characteristics of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) on the surface of virus, influenza A viruses can be classified into several subtypes. HA acts like a key to unlock the door of the host cells for the invading viruses, while NA contributes to destroy the cell receptor, which renders free transmission of the viruses in the body of the host. Both enzymes are highly variant, and the defined influenza A viruses, so far, are nominated based on different combinations of 16 types of HA (H1-16) and 9 types of NA (N1-9), such as H1N1, H1N2, H5N1, etc. Among all the subtypes, HA 1\u20133 can cause pandemic of human influenza, and H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are common and fixed virus phenotypes causing human influenza. In human history, three pandemic outbreaks of influenza occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968. The prevailing influenza virus in the pandemic of 1918 was influenza A (H1N1) virus. Due to common existence of most influenza A (H1N1) virus strains in pigs, the WHO once nominated the influenza as swine influenza at the beginning of its outbreak.",

As a new mutate of influenza virus, influenza A (H1N1) virus differs from those causing human seasonal H1N1 influenza for years in many aspects, such as genetic and antigenic properties. Evolutionary analysis has revealed that the virus is composed of gene segments from three different influenza viruses: avian influenza virus, swine influenza virus, and human influenza virus. The eight different gene segments are originated from different strains of influenza virus, showing genetic properties of NA and M segments of Asian swine influenza virus, PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS segments of North American triple reassortant swine H1 influenza. Humans are generally susceptible to influenza A (H1N1) that can spread from human to human. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that influenza A (H1N1) virus cannot only affect respiratory epithelial cells but also infect dendritic cells (DC) and mononuclear macrophages (MC).

At the early stage of the disease, ground-glass opacities may be integrated as multiple scattering consolidation opacities. Some of the consolidations are not integrated at the onset, but will be integrated within the following several days. The multiple scattering patchy opacities can change into light thin small flaky opacities and gradually disappear.In some cases, the above lesions are accompanied by small quantity of pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenectasis (Fig. 4.12).\n\n",
