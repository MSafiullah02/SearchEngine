When we are talking about a surgery, surgeons and other operating room medical personnel are at risk of infection at the same time. Postponing all unnecessary surgeries during COVID-19 pandemic has become a standard of care today, but there are still many cases in which it is not possible to delay surgery. It makes sense that as much as we care about the patient, we care about the health of the staff. Under normal circumstances, laparoscopic approaches may be of great benefit to the patient, but in a crisis caused by a respiratory infection, the situation will definitely be different. The major rout of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory droplets and the most dangerous situation for health care workers is laryngoscopy and intubation. Therefore, avoiding general anesthesia, which requires airway management (e.g. intubation), is one of the most important ways to protect them.(2, 3) Thus, local methods such as neuraxial blocks are superior to general techniques of anesthesia. Because most laparoscopic surgeries require requirements such as Trendelenburg positioning, which is best done under general anesthesia, laparoscopic approaches cannot be insisted on as much as before for surgeries.",

            "text": "On the other hand, we are at risk of the virus spreading due to the process itself. It is true that due to restrictions on feasibility of research, no case of virus transmission through surgical plume or smoke has been proven yet, but no research has been conducted that refutes such a possibility. The presence of the virus RNA in the stool has been proven nearly half of patients even after the patient has recovered.(4) Furthermore the possibility of virus shedding in urine is another concern.(5) In this way, no space in the abdominopelvic cavity can be considered virus-free and importing a laparoscopic trocar to any point of this space carries the risk of spreading the virus throughout the operating room by gas insufflation. However, in the interaction between the anesthesiologist and the surgeon if the benefits of this technique outweigh the potential harms, laparoscopy can be performed by considering appropriate precautions which is mentioned in the article to reduce the risk of virus transmission as much as possible.",
