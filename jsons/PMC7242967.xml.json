            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The disease has advanced into a pandemic, started with small chains of spreading, further culminating into larger chains of spread in many countries resulting in the widespread transmission consequently across the globe affecting all the continents (Anderson et al., 2020). The fatality case of COVID-19 risk is around 1% and that it can kill healthy adults, as well as the elderly people with, existing health problems (Gates, 2020). According to Worldometers (2020), 14 May 2020, with the total coronavirus cases rising to 4,490,958, and total deaths 301,616, USA is the worst affected country from the COVID-19 pandemic with 86,098 deaths. It took 67 days from the first reported of COVID-19 to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000, and just four days for the third 100,000 (WHO, 2020a, WHO, 2020b). The accelerating spread of the COVID-19 and its outcomes around the world has led people to fear, panic, concern, and anxiety (Ahorsu et al., 2020), panic buying of surgical masks (Wang et al., 2020), stigma, depression, racism, and xenophobia. Besides, as there is no medication and vaccination yet, wrong use of disinfectant liquids, methyl alcohols, garlic, lemon tea is amongst the many misinformation to cure COVID-19. Moreover, the fear of infection, quarantine, social isolation, a lack of self-care even leads individuals to suicide. Predictably, any contagious epidemic outbreak has deleterious effects on individuals and society (Duan and Zhu, 2020).",

The government of Bangladesh (GoB) deployed armed forces from 24 March to facilitate the social-distancing and prevention of the disease. Emergency healthcare services and law enforcement services were exempted from this announcement. Nevertheless, just after the announcement of lockdown, more than 11 million people left Dhaka to be in their home districts and commenced the risk of COVID-19 infection to the entire 64 districts in Bangladesh. On 15 May 2020, with 20,065 confirmed cases, 298 deaths (Figure 1\n) Bangladesh is within the top 30 affected country. With only 41 labs located in the urban areas, it is not easy to be tested for COVID-19 and often the tests are done after the patients had expired. Moreover, at present Bangladesh has 1,169 ICU beds, totalling to 0.72 beds/100,000 citizens. Of these 432 beds are in government hospitals and 737 in private hospitals. Likewise, there are only 550 ventilators in the country (IEDCR, 2020).",

The primary healthcare treatments in the hospitals and private clinics were disrupted in the lockdown. Moreover, many emergency service providers such as frontline doctors, healthcare staffs, caregivers, police and armed forces, bankers and government authority were infected, isolated and even died. Private practitioners, clinics, and hospitals in suburban and rural areas were shut down due to the fear of infection. Moreover, the healthcare workers who have treated the patients and infected have been socially hatred and stigmatized. Besides, the deceased was even denied burial in the local graveyards which are basic human rights and, in most cases, handled by the government authority (TBS, 2020a). The price hike of the daily necessities was observed due to low supply and shopkeepers and suppliers stopped working fearing infection. Middle-income, lower-income and daily-wedge earners fell into a severe financial shortfall due to loss of jobs, incomes. With their last savings spent, they are plunged to be ultra-poor.",

Besides, Bangladesh hosts the largest refugee camps in Cox's Bazar which is also about to embrace the COVID-19 pandemic, where, it will have catastrophic outcomes (Hopman et al., 2020). Despite the precautions taken by the government and other international aid bodies, on 14 May 2020, the Coronavirus cases were detected in Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps (TBS, 2020b). Moreover, miscommunication among the government ministries, policymakers, advisers and the country's apex trade organizations such as Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) and the trade organization of the ready-made garment (RMG) manufacturers Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) led industry workers to return to the industrial districts due to the message of reopening at least two times first on 4th April and later on 11th April. To save their jobs, thousands of RMG workers travelled back to Dhaka and its surrounding districts on foot, in a truck, or covered vans without social distancing while ensuring further transmission. The district of Dhaka and its Upazilas Savar and Ashulia, Gazipur, Narayanganj, and Chittagong remained the highest infected clusters of COVID-19 infection (IEDCR, 2020). The latest extension period declared by the GoB is until 30 May 2020. Yet the RMG factories and other industrial operations resumed from 26 April 2020. Moreover, as the biggest Muslim festival Eid-Ul-Fitr approaches, mass people are gathering in the shopping centres despite the risk of spreading human transmission. It is utterly depicting the scenario of overlooking risks of the pandemic by unaware citizens while social anxiety and fear of the pandemic in concerned citizens. Both should be immediately dealt with by the Government along with the alliance groups with proper risk communication.",

PCA is one of the population data reduction techniques that indicate each potentiality of variables and their significance level in a huge sample size.

The results of the KMO >0.5 (the KMO value was 0.903 in this research) and the significance of Bartlett's sphericity test at p < 0.01 verified our datasets to be fitted for the PCA (Islam et al., 2020). The number of factors chosen was based on the Kaiser's normalization principle, where the only factors with eigenvalues>1.0 were regarded.

However, the reported case numbers are given by the Bangladesh Government certainly underestimates the actual number of infected persons given the shortages or unavailability of test kits (Ebrahim et al., 2020). The laboratory facilities for testing are only accessible in the urban areas and 33 testing laboratories are still a few numbers in a country of 165 million population. The fear of getting the virus-infected along with the administrative procedure of testing and reluctance of other private clinics and hospitals to admit patients is a sign of weak governance in the healthcare of Bangladesh. In this scenario, other critical care patients are denied admittances, negligence, and often left to die without treatments. After the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Bangladesh, at least 929 + death cases having COVID-19 like symptoms were reported in the different national daily newspapers until 10 May 2020, which is 3 times higher than the reported deaths by the GoB. This indicates a serious level of community transmission is occurring in Bangladesh.",

Moreover, the administrative procedure of the deceased to burial put another confusion and religious fear in the minds of the common people as the victims to COVID-19 are buried without Muslim funeral procedures of baths and the presence of family members and relatives. In this scenario, it is imperative to deal with the peoples' fear and anxiety by the government. Proper information should be circulated to get the people out of confusion.

Yet weeks of being in isolation, quarantine, physical trauma creates further loneliness and anxiety and issues of a mental health crisis that have been mostly overlooked. At the individual level and the government level, proper risk communication is required. Special attention should be given to combat child and women abuse. Necessary action should be proposed for the post-recovery phase, suicide prevention, and mental health management (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Gunnell et al., 2020; Mamun et al., 2020). Several cases of suicide were reported due to the fear and stress of COVID-19 infection symptoms, job-loss, sudden fall to extreme poverty, economic crisis, hunger, and unable to cope with social hatred. This kind of traumatic situation should be dealt with immediately by the government through proper community counselling.",

The urban COVID-19 testing facilities, long serial to be tested, lowest facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients hampered the other critical patients to get healthcare services. It was a good decision by the government to recruit 6000 doctors and nurses to combat this pandemic. The government needs to take decisions to implement testing facilities for both public and private clinical laboratories all over Bangladesh. As with the COVID-19 outbreak, other critical care patients and infectious diseases such as dengue testing are being affected and patients are being deprived.

The recommendations collected in the perception study can be summarized as to increase COVID-test rate and medical facilities. The strengthening and decentralization of the COVID-19 medical facilities and treatment are especially important for all 64 districts as the disease spread to entire Bangladesh.
