From the IC they are typically transported to the cisternal stacks of the Golgi apparatus, prior to their delivery to the different organelles of the endomembrane system or secretion to the extracellular space. Bidirectional ER\u2013Golgi trafficking involves the sequential operation of membrane-bound coat protein II (COPII) and COPI coats (Aridor and Balch, 1996, Scales et al., 1997, Stephens et al., 2000). ER-derived COPII vesicles mediate forward (anterograde) transport, while IC- and Golgi-derived COPI vesicles are thought to act in the opposite (retrograde) direction (Lee et al., 2004, Rabouille and Klumperman, 2005). Retrograde transport also involves COPI-independent routes (Kano et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Despite the conservation of the transport machineries (such as the COP coats), the organization of the ER\u2013Golgi interface varies in different eukaryotic cells. For example, in plants, certain yeasts, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the individual Golgi stacks lie next to the widespread ERES, establishing units for short range ER\u2013Golgi communication. By contrast, in animal cells the Golgi stacks are linked together into a continuous ribbon around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)/centrosome, whereas the ER extends throughout the cytoplasm. Hence, a large proportion of the ERES reside at the cell periphery and ER\u2013Golgi trafficking depends on the long distance movements of the IC elements along MT tracks (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013, Day et al., 2013, Saraste and Svensson, 1991, Presley et al., 1997, Scales et al., 1997). Thus, it has been proposed that the IC represents a late evolutionary invention, which developed to meet the special sorting, transport and recycling requirements of the large-sized animal cells, but lacks lower eukaryotes. However, results showing that the IC constitutes an extensive membrane system that can be compared with the endosomal network in complexity, are questioning this view.",

By light microscopy (LM) the proteins were localized at 15 \u00b0C to scattered globular structures in the cytoplasm, a pattern distinct from that of ER or Golgi (Kuismanen and Saraste, 1989). The transport block was readily reversible, and the proteins entered the Golgi stacks and reached the PM following the transfer of cells from 15 \u00b0C to 28 \u00b0C, showing that these structures are normal transport intermediates.",

Like the SFV proteins, the G-protein was found to maintain its ER-type high-mannose glycans at 15 \u00b0C, indicating lack of processing by Golgi enzymes. Furthermore, cell fractionation experiments showed that newly synthesized secretory proteins are arrested in a post-ER location when pancreatic exocrine cells are kept at 16 \u00b0C (Saraste et al., 1986). Live cell imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) equipped with an ER targeting signal (ssGFP) and EM studies of procollagen and growth hormone constructs verified that the transport of membrane and secretory proteins is similarly affected at 15\u201316 \u00b0C (Blum et al., 2000, Volchuk et al., 2000, Trucco et al., 2004). In addition, the transport of virus glycoproteins and cholesterol appears to be blocked at the same site at this temperature (Urbani and Simoni, 1990, Heino et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The discovery of the lys-asp-glu-leu tetra-peptide (KDEL)-motif in abundant, lumenal ER proteins lead to the proposal that the 15 \u00b0C/budding compartment is the post-ER site from which these proteins are retrieved to the ER (Munro and Pelham, 1987, Warren, 1987, Pelham, 1989). The first mammalian KDEL-receptor, a multispanning membrane protein, was identified and shown to predominantly localize to the IC and cis-Golgi (Lewis and Pelham, 1990, Tang et al., 1993, Griffiths et al., 1994, Orci et al., 1997). Also, KDEL proteins, such as the immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP/GRP78), glucose-regulated protein of 94 kDa (GRP94), protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and calreticulin (CR), are present in the IC (Griffiths et al., 1994, Connolly et al., 1994, Zuber et al., 2001; Ying et al., 2002, Breuza et al., 2004). Following binding to their receptor, the proteins are retrieved to the ER in COPI vesicles (Orci et al., 1997, Mart\u00ednez-Men\u00e1rguez et al., 1999, Majoul et al., 2001). Attachment of the KDEL-motif to lysosomal enzymes and the use of the 15 \u00b0C block suggested that the enzyme that initiates the formation of their lysosomal targeting signal (mannose-6-phosphate) resides in the IC (Pelham, 1988, Lazzarino and Gabel, 1988, Dittmer and von Figura, 1999). The cytoplasmic tails of certain type I integral membrane proteins were shown to contain dilysine (KKXX)-motifs, which by directly interacting with COPI coats result in their retrieval from the IC/cis-Golgi to the ER (Nilsson et al., 1989, Jackson et al., 1990, Jackson et al., 1993, Cosson and Letourneur, 1997).",

At 15 \u00b0C the recycling of p58/ERGIC-53 to the ER is inhibited and the proteins pile up in the same pre-Golgi structures that contain the SFV or VSV membrane proteins (Schweizer et al., 1990, Saraste and Svensson, 1991, Plutner et al., 1992), verifying that the p58/ERGIC-53 compartment (Figure 1, Figure 4\n) is equivalent to the site where cargo is arrested at low temperature.",

COPI vesicle budding depends on the activation of small GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family (Popoff et al., 2011). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of these Arfs, GBF1, is the master regulator of COPI recruitment and the target of BFA (Niu et al., 2005). It localizes to the IC and cis-Golgi and plays a key role in ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Kawamoto et al., 2002, Garcia-Mata et al., 2003, Zhao et al., 2006, Szul et al., 2007). GBF1 knock down or specific inhibition by Golgicide A releases COPI coats and arrests the VSV G-protein in the IC, indicating its involvement in anterograde IC-to-Golgi transport (Manolea et al., 2008, S\u00e1enz et al., 2009). However, the prevailing view is that the main function of COPI vesicles is to recycle membrane and selected proteins to the ER. In pancreatic exocrine cells approximately 70% of the coats associate with the VTCs, suggesting that the IC represents the main point for recycling (Mart\u00ednez-Men\u00e1rguez et al., 1999).",

Both interact with multiple effectors suggesting that they coordinate successive transport steps (Barnekow et al., 2009). The association of Rab1 with the cytoplasmic surface of IC and cis-Golgi membranes, and its absence from the ER, has been demonstrated by EM (Griffiths et al., 1994, Saraste et al., 1995, Satoh et al., 2003, Marie et al., 2012; Figure 2\n). The two Rab1 isoforms, Rab1A and RAB1B (93% homology), are recruited to IC membranes at ERES, show similar localizations by LM (Mochizuki et al., 2013; Figure 3(a)\n), but seem to play distinct roles in tubular and vesicular (long and short range) trafficking within the IC. Accordingly, live cell imaging and cell fractionation have shown that Rab1A mainly associates with IC tubules (Sannerud et al., 2006, Marie et al., 2009), while Rab1B interacts with GBF1 and evidently modulates COPI recruitment to globular IC domains (Alvarez et al., 2003, Monetta et al., 2007; see below). Also, Rab1A is specifically phosphorylated at mitosis (Bailly et al., 1991), correlating with the cessation of tubular IC dynamics, whereas COPI-mediated vesicular transport continues (Marie et al., 2012). Rab1A can functionally replace Ypt1, which coordinates two-way ER\u2013Golgi trafficking in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Haubruck et al., 1989, Segev, 2001, Kamena et al., 2008).",

Besides the IC/cis-Golgi tethers GM130 and GMAP-210 (Rios et al., 2004), Rab2 has been shown to interact with medial- and trans-Golgi tethers, suggesting a more widespread function (Short et al., 2001, Sinka et al., 2008). The Rab1 effector p115 is functional already at the peripheral ERES (Alvarez et al., 1999), while GM130 (bound to its membrane anchor GRASP65) cycles between central IC and cis-Golgi (Marra et al., 2001) and regulates membrane tethering at a later transport step (Alvarez et al., 2001, Marra et al., 2007). Rab1 also interacts with the transmembrane tethers golgin-84 and giantin, which appear to act in COPI vesicle trafficking at the lateral rims of the Golgi stacks (Diao et al., 2003, Malsam et al., 2005, Barnekow et al., 2009, Munro, 2011).",

The determination of the exact fusion steps is complicated by the continuous cycling of the SNAREs in COPI vesicles (Hay et al., 1998, Martinez-Men\u00e1rguez et al., 2001). In analogy to yeast, Rab1 (Ypt1) has been suggested to recruit p115 (Uso1p) to COPII vesicles at ERES (Allan et al., 2000), followed by the formation of a SNARE complex (Sec22B, membrin, Bet1 and syntaxin 5), which mediates either homotypic fusion of COPII vesicles or their heterotypic fusion with the stationary IC (Zhang et al., 1997, Xu et al., 2000; see below). Another SNARE complex (syntaxin 5, GS28, Bet1 and Ykt6) is involved in a later cis-Golgi transport step (Zhang and Hong, 2001).",

Thereafter, they move in a MT- and dynein-dependent (Burkhardt et al., 1997) \u2018stop-and-go\u2019 fashion to the Golgi region, where they either fuse with or transform into cis-Golgi cisternae (Figure 7(a)\n). In other words, the IC elements are transient structures which are first formed de novo at ERES and then consumed at cis-Golgi. These mobile structures (speed of about 1 \u00b5m/sec) corresponding to saccules or more complex, pleiomorphic elements (Mironov et al., 2003) appear to consist of subdomains enriched in antero- or retrograde cargo, or COPI (Shima et al., 1999, Stephens et al., 2000).

It proposes that the IC consists of stationary, long-lived membrane clusters, located close to the ERES, which communicate with the ER and Golgi via distinct transport carriers (Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006). Thus, in a two-step transport process cargo is first transfered from ER to the IC via heterotypic fusion of COPII vesicles. The IC then generates novel (possibly COPI-coated) anterograde carriers (ACs) that move along MTs to the cis-Golgi. The recycling of GFP-ERGIC-53 to the ER evidently occurs mainly from the ERES-associated IC, since it was not detected in the ACs containing soluble, Golgi-destined cargo. The identification of a motif in the neuronal GABA transporter, that seems to be required for its exit from the IC, supports the stable nature of the IC (Farhan et al., 2008).",

In cells displaying centrosome motility, for example, cells that are migrating or entering mitosis, the centrosome-targeted membranes can be resolved as a separate compartment, called the pericentrosomal IC (pcIC), which is distinct from the cis-Golgi-adjacent IC domain (Marie et al., 2009, Marie et al., 2012; Mochizuki et al., 2013; Figure 3(a)). Live imaging further showed that the separated pcIC and the Golgi communicate via tubular and globular carriers. The pcIC contains its own pool of COPI coats, and mediates the BFA-induced, COPI-independent backflow of Golgi enzymes to the ER, suggesting that forward pcIC-to-Golgi transport depends on COPI coats, and thus is blocked by BFA (Marie et al., 2009).",

The observed major concentration of soluble secretory proteins within the IC (Oprins et al., 2001) could be explained by similar geometry-based sorting, namely, their exclusion from vesicles and tubules, which recycle lipids and membrane-bound proteins back to the ER (Mart\u00ednez-Men\u00e1rguez et al., 1999). Membrane recycling is a major function of both the IC and endosomes in mammalian cells. Due to the similarity of the tubular domain of the IC with the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), its \u2018mirror compartment\u2019 next to the centrosome, it has been designated as the biosynthetic recycling compartment (BRC; Saraste and Goud, 2007, Marie et al., 2009).",

The pH-sensitive interactions of the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein (LRP) and procollagen with the chaperones RAP and Hsp47, respectively (Bu et al., 1995, Satoh et al., 1996), and partial co-localization of DAMP (a marker for acidic compartments) and p58/ERGIC-53 in central IC elements (Palokangas et al., 1998), are in accordance with this idea. The pH of the ER and cis-Golgi has been estimated to be about 7.2 and 6.5\u20136.7, respectively (Paroutis et al., 2004, Vavassori et al., 2013).",

The role of COPI in anterograde transport has been considered for some time (Hosobuchi et al., 1992, Pepperkok et al., 1993, Peter et al., 1993, Orci et al., 1997, Malsam et al., 2005).

The route between the IC and the leading edge or growth cone of motile fibroblasts or neurons, respectively (Figure 5, Figure 6), could participate in cholesterol and integrin trafficking (Urbani and Simoni, 1990, Sannerud et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2010) or correspond to the BFA-resistant ER-IC-PM route that supports phagocytosis (Becker et al., 2005, Saraste and Goud, 2007; see below). Direct pericentrosomal communication between the IC and the endosomal system seems to be used by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) during its Golgi-independent transport to the cell surface (Yoo et al., 2002, Marie et al., 2009, Gee et al., 2011). Further, the presence of the IC in neuronal dendrites may provide a Golgi-independent satellite pathway for local dendritic trafficking (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1995, Sannerud et al., 2006, Ehlers, 2013).",

The cycling of cis-Golgi proteins to the IC could be a constitutive event (Lin et al., 1999, Marra et al., 2001, Jarvela and Linstedt, 2012).

The presence of quality control machinery in the IC and the finding that the ER-associated degradation of certain proteins requires their ER export is in accordance with this idea (Zuber et al., 2001, Anelli and Sitia, 2008). The PDI family member ERp44 and p58/ERGIC-53 cooperate in the IC/cis-Golgi in sequential assembly of IgM polymers (Anelli and Sitia, 2008). Unassembled IgM or T-cell antigen receptor subunits bound to ERp44 or BiP, respectively, can be retrieved to the ER by the KDEL-receptor in a pH-dependent manner (Yamamoto et al., 2001, Vavassori et al., 2013), similarly as the overexpressed, misfolded VSV G-protein (Hammond and Helenius, 1994) and mutant V2 vasopressin receptors (Hermosilla et al., 2004). Additional proof for a post-ER checkpoint is provided by studies showing the accumulation of the deletion mutant \u0394F508 of CFTR (Gilbert et al., 1998), misfolded MHC class I proteins (Hsu et al., 1991, Raposo et al., 1995), and proinsulin (Zuber et al., 2004) in expanded IC elements.",

In dendritic cells the delivery of certain proteins \u2013 such as the peptide transporter (TAP), CR and tapasin \u2013 from ER to the phagosome is required for antigen cross-presentation. This pathway depends on the interaction between Sec22B and the PM SNARE syntaxin 4 and involves efficient recruitment of the integral IC components sec22B and p58/ERGIC-53 to the phagosomes (Cebrian et al., 2011), in accordance with the idea that the IC provides an important membrane source for their formation. The presence of CR, tapasin, and functional TAP in the IC/cis-Golgi support this possibility (Kleijmeer et al., 1992, Howe et al., 2009, Ghanem et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The IC plays a role in the Golgi-independent trafficking of CFTR (see above). Mutations in p58/ERGIC-53/LMAN1, or its partner MCFD2 (multiple coagulation factor deficiency protein 2) result in an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder called combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII. They disrupt the lectin mannose-binding protein 1 (LMAN1)-MCFD2 receptor complex, thereby inhibiting the secretion of these factors and reducing their serum levels (Nichols et al., 1998, Zheng and Zhang, 2013). Parkinson\u2019s disease-related cytotoxic protein, \u03b1-synuclein, has been suggested to interfere with ER\u2013Golgi trafficking and to arrest autophagy by inhibiting Rab1 function (Cooper et al., 2006, Winslow et al., 2010). Many phagocytosed bacterial pathogens, such as Legionella, hijack the ER-to-IC-to-phagosome pathway during their intracellular replication (Isberg et al., 2009, Arasaki et al., 2012; see above). In addition to coronaviruses, the IC has been implicated in the replication of bunya-, entero-, flavi-, picorna, and vacciniaviruses (J\u00e4ntti et al., 1997, Risco et al., 2002, Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008, Hsu et al., 2010). Surprisingly, p58/ERGIC-53 interacts in a lectin-independent manner with fusion proteins of a number of membrane viruses and participates in different stages of their life cycle (Klaus et al., 2013).",

(b) The IC consists of stationary membrane clusters located close to ERES.
