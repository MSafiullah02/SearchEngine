This toxicity has been ascribed to the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF),\ninterleukin (IL)\u20106 or other cytokines by B lymphocytes, following the binding of rituximab to CD20 [19]. To prevent these reactions, the FDA recommends slow infusion rates, especially for the first\nadministration of rituximab (initial rate of 50 mg/h with an increase of 50 mg/h every 30 min, to a maximum of 400 mg/h unless\nsigns of infusion reaction occur). Subsequent infusions can be accelerated to 100 mg/h increasing to 400 mg/h by steps of 100 mg/h\nevery 30 min. Recent protocols with 90\u2010minute infusion rates do not seem to increase the incidence of infusion reactions in\npreviously treated patients [13, 15,\n19, 20]. Moreover, premedication with\nantihistamine, steroids and acetaminophen prior to rituximab infusion is often sufficient to prevent infusion reactions\n[13].",

In these cases, it is noteworthy that the tumor lysis syndrome occurred in the\ncontext of high burden lymphoproliferative disorders (bulky lymphadenopathies or high white blood cell [WBC] count) [22].

The drug is administered as curative treatment,\nalone or in combination with chemotherapy, as well as in preventive and maintenance therapy. Therefore, the exposed population is\nlarge and increasing, making these toxic events likely to present in our ICUs. Critical care specialists must be aware of the\ndrug\u2019s different potentially serious adverse effects, which may occur immediately, or short\u2010 or long\u2010term after rituximab\ninfusion, depending on the mechanism of toxicity. The toxicity of more recently released anti\u2010CD20 antibodies is less\nknown. Nonetheless, ofatumumab (used in CLL) or obinutuzumab (used in both CLL and follicular lymphoma) seem to share toxicities\nwith rituximab (e.g., infusion reaction, late cytopenia, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy or HBV reactivation\n[82]), prompting careful surveillance of patients receiving new anti\u2010CD20\nantibodies.",
