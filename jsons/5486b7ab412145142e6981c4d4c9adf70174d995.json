Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS-CoV emerged, swept around the globe via routes of international air travel, and caused 8,098 SARS cases in 26 countries with 774 deaths. This strained the healthcare system in the countries with infections and led to travel restrictions and signifi cant effects on the global economy (WHO 2004a ). On July 5, 2003, the WHO declared the chain of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV in the epidemic broken (WHO 2003c ) . Since July 2003, SARS infection has been documented on several occasions. Three incidents were attributed to breaches in laboratory biosafety. The fourth incident involved four communityacquired cases attributed to animal or environmental exposure in three and an undetermined source of infection in the fourth (Liang et al. 2004 ) .",

They emerge in winter and spring and demonstrate periodicity with epidemics occurring at 2 to 3 year intervals. They primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections that are more common in children than in adults, and they account for an estimated 15 % of adult colds and up to 35 % of upper respiratory tract infections during peak viral activity. Less commonly, they are associated with lower respiratory tract disease in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly (Gerna et al. 2006 ; Principi et al. 2010 ; van der Hoek 2007 ) . In late 2012, HCoV-EMC was isolated in a 60-year-old male who presented with acute pneumonia, subsequently developed renal failure, and had a fatal outcome (Zaki et al. 2012 ) . From discovery to mid-September 2013, HCoV-EMC, renamed MERS-CoV, (de Groot 2013 ) caused 132 laboratory-confi rmed cases of severe acute pneumonia including 58 deaths. (WHO 2013 ) .",

In the absence of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV anywhere in the world, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection should be considered only in patients who require hospitalization for radiologically confi rmed pneumonia and who have an epidemiologic history that raises suspicion of SARS-CoV infection. Suspicion is heightened when the patient, within 10 days of onset of illness, has a history of recent travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with ill persons with a history of travel to these areas, or is employed in an occupation at risk for SARS-CoV, or is part of a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is available, including antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the positive predictive value of a diagnostic test is very low in the absence of personto-person transmission worldwide, and the CDC recommends testing be performed judiciously and in consultation with local or state health departments (CDC 2005 ).",

The greatest risk of recurrence is from emergence or introduction of SARS-CoV from laboratories and emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses from wildlife or other animal reservoirs. If SARS recurs, early detection of infected individuals is essential to contain local spread of infection and prevent international dissemination. Primary responsibility for risk assessment and management of SARS is with national health authorities, for example, the CDC in the United States. However, in its role coordinating global and regional surveillance, the WHO has revised its guidelines for global surveillance and reporting of SARS and has provided a framework of activities at national and international levels for risk assessment of SARS (WHO 2004b , c ).",

Notably, the domains of the S glycoprotein that allow for viral infection have been identifi ed, ACE2 has been determined to be a surface receptor for binding the S glycoprotein, and the regions of interaction between the S glycoprotein and ACE2 have been mapped. All of these present targets for vaccine development. However, much of the immunology and pathogenesis of SARS is incompletely understood. Of particular concern is the potential for a SARS vaccine to trigger immunopathogenic mechanisms which could lead to more severe disease in vaccines, as has been observed with some veterinary coronavirus vaccines. Additionally, coronaviruses are notorious for their frequent mutations which further complicate development of a suitable vaccine. Currently there are no licensed vaccines for use in SARS (NIAID 2012 ).",

Four of the non-SARS coronaviruses mainly cause upper respiratory tract infections that are more common in children than in adults. The fi fth non-SARS coronavirus, MERS-CoV, reportedly causes severe acute pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV has been identifi ed as the etiologic agent for SARS, which caused 8,098 infections in 26 countries with 774 deaths during the 2002-2003 epidemic. Initial signs and symptoms of SARS are nonspecifi c and common, thereby generating a wide differential diagnosis of more commonly occurring lower respiratory tract pathogens. SARS primarily targets the lungs and produces a viral pneumonia with a high mortality rate. DAD is the histopathologic hallmark of SARS and the phase of DAD varies with the duration of illness: acutephase DAD is seen in illnesses of 10 days or less, whereas organizing-phase DAD is associated with illnesses greater than 10 days in duration. SARS has no vaccine and no treatment.",
