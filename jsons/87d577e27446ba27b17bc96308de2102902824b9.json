Therefore, residents would be able to use these data for automated estimation of the potential risks of contacts combined with the location information stored in their mobile phones.

Accordingly, public health authorities are not capable of efficiently alerting the potential contacts about the risk associated with the infectious agents, who are mostly unconcerned. We consider that sharing the open data on the patient location information can be used to efficiently bridge this gap by personalizing the alerts for each resident through the automated estimation of potential intersections between the resident and the infected patients based on the location history stored in their own mobile phones. Such approach can be helpful, particularly, when patients have visited various places, and when the number of patients has increases to a certain threshold exceeding the capacity of ordinary people to process the trace information corresponding to all patients.",

These data can be publicly used to perform mapping of patient traces and estimate the risks of potential contacts for individuals (5) .

Conventionally, these data need to be handled by authorized independent systems. In this regard, analyzing the geospatial information has gained less attention in the information retrieval field. Even concerning the systems with an extension to perform geospatial estimations, the interoperability between systems is not guaranteed [21] . To address the problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) proposed a framework that can consistently handle qualitative and quantitative information in in terms of geospatial knowledge called GeoSPARQL [22] . GeoSPARQL has been implemented as an extension to the resource description framework (RDF) [23] and SPARQL [24] , a query language available in RDF, which was standardized by the W3C. GeoSPARQL can be used to realize the representation and retrieval of information in terms of both qualitative and quantitative data and to enable inference operations on the knowledge, providing the foundation for facilitating the representation of patient tracing.",

In this regard, announcements by public health authorities in English-speaking countries are deemed to have similar characteristics, concluding from the twelve announcements we found by using search engines.

For the evaluation, we analyzed 39 press releases issued in the period from Jan 16, 2020 to Feb 11, 2020 and arranged the available information according to the PLOD model by using RDF (in the turtle format). The metadata of the press release itself, the patient information, and the patient trace information were successfully expressed for all cases by using PIDs issued for each entity considered as a Subject. However, we confirmed that the information corresponding to Objects became empty for the cases in which the detailed data were not provided in the corresponding release. Among the considered 39 press releases, 23 included the patient information, and 8 out of those 23 represented the trace information of patients, including date and location. To estimate the contact risk using the PLOD model, it is essential to include the origin of a trace or a destination, preferably, together with the detailed information about the visited places. To obtain the detailed description of the trace information, we extracted the steps from each case report, and 21 steps were identified on the basis of the 8 releases. Among these steps, 10 included the origin or destination data with varying granularity: 8 were described at the prefecture level, 1 as \"oversea\", and only 1 contained the facility-level specific information that could be converted into the coordinates (latitude and longitude).",

Second, several included cases of the profession information, such as \"a bus guide\" and \"a driver\", indicated the possibility of trips but not did not specify it in a manner sufficient to trace the case. Figure 4 illustrates a case corresponding to this category. Third, there were the releases that indicated traces in generic terms, for example, \"returning home with a child\", which could not be converted into the coordinates. Lastly, several releases referred to the other press releases that could contain the trace information, such as \"same as past case A\". It is hardly possible to convert the first and the second cases into the coordinates, whereas the third and the fourth cases might be processed to obtain the required data. For example, we may infer that the \"home\" is supposed to be in the city where the press release has been issued, and, similarly, the reference in the fourth case might be appropriately processed. Both cases can be organized as the best fit for the SPARQL-based queries that can infer the information even if it is not explicitly stated.",

In the Japanese health care system, each local government is responsible for control of infectious diseases, and therefore, public releases are issued by them either in HTML, or PDF format at their websites. In this setting, there are mainly two ways to provide mobile applications with access to the open data. The one approach is to establish a centralized model, in which a national public health authority, such as Ministry of Health, would perform the entire processing, such as collection of releases, conversion of formats, and distribution. The other approach is to implement a decentralized approach in which each local government would issue its announcement in the RDF format using the standardized vocabularies. In the latter case, there would be a need for a public RDF data repository providing mobile applications with the data they need. As both approaches necessitate the substantial coordination between organizations, a reasonable option would be to collect, convert, and distribute the open data via a third party organization, considering that the releases are publicly usable.",

Even a state-of-art RDF store may not be suitable to handle the surge of SPARQL queries from a large number of mobile phones. To mitigate this problem, we may also define a simplified query, equivalent to a full-fledged SPARQL query. SPARQL provides a flexible framework to retrieve various data at the cost of the overhead to process the complex query on the server side.
