They lead to high morbidity, impose high costs on the health system and are among the major obstacles for pilgrims to perform Hajj duties. The main aim of our study was to determine types, frequencies, etiologies, and epidemiologic factors of respiratory diseases among Iranian Hajj pilgrims and to suggest some preventive and treatment strategies. Methods: To determine the types and frequencies of respiratory syndromes, we implemented a syndromic surveillance method in Iranian health care system for Hajj during 5 consecutive years. To achieve the etiology of these diseases, we performed 4 concurrent before and after studies. We also evaluated efficacy of the flu and pneumovax vaccines among Iranian Hajj pilgrims in 2 studies. To determine some other epidemiological factors, we conducted 4 additional studies.",

Changes in routine activities (sleep, physiological habits and nutrition, etc.) as well as fatigue and anxiety resulting from traveling and performing pilgrimage ceremonies makes the pilgrims susceptible to diseases (1) . In addition, high density of population causes transmission of resistant respiratory organisms among pilgrims from different countries (2) (3) . Consequently, respiratory diseases are very prevalent during Hajj ceremony. They lead to high morbidity, impose high costs on the health system, and are among the major obstacles for pilgrims to perform Hajj duties (4) (5) (6) (7) .

Serum samples were gathered at the time of departure from the country and 3 weeks after their return to the country, and were kept at -20\u00baC.
