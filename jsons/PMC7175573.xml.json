            "text": "Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is an important parasitic zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum, endemic in the Mediterranean basin including Spain. The disease is transmitted by female blood-feeding phlebotomine sand flies, and dogs (Canis familiaris) are both its natural host and the major reservoir of infection for humans and other animals [1, 2]. The presence of L. infantum in felids and other animals has also been confirmed, although so far there are few data on these species despite being considered a potential secondary reservoir for the infection of humans and other animals [3\u20137]. The closest example is the largest outbreak of human leishmaniasis known in Europe occurring in 2009 in the southwest of Madrid [8] in which hares (Lepus granatensis) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were identified in xenodiagnostic and molecular diagnostic studies as reservoirs and held responsible for the transmission of human leishmaniosis [9, 10]. The epidemiological role of wildlife species has not yet been established [4, 11\u201313] yet several authors propose that these animals can act as sentinels as they indicate the risk of transmission to other animals (domestic and wild) or even to humans, highlighting the importance of the concept of \u201cOne Health\u201d for the control of leishmaniosis [14\u201316].",

However, complementary diagnostic tests such as blood tests (blood count and biochemical profile), urine tests (e.g. urinalysis, urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPC)), ultrasound, etc. are required to identify the clinicopathological abnormalities associated with the disease and thus assess the general disease status of the animal and monitor its clinical progression after treatment [2, 19, 20].",

Prevention is the best way to fight the disease, greatly helping to stop the spread of infection to other animals and humans. However, at present, no preventive measure offers 100% guarantee. Thus, recommendations are adequate control of the vector, early diagnosis, and the treatment of sick dogs according to their clinical stage depending on their clinical signs [2, 21, 22]. The development and appearance of new vaccines for CanL is a new strategy for the control of this important zoonosis [21, 23, 24].",

Nevertheless, other CVBD (e.g. dirofilariosis and piroplasmosis) were also reported. According to previous epidemiological studies, the presence of some vector-borne diseases is associated with geographical distribution [28\u201333]. Indeed, in this survey, dirofilariosis (South of Spain, East of Spain and Canary Islands) and piroplasmosis (North of Spain) were associated with this variable as suggested by others [29, 33\u201335]. According to these new results, CanL seems to be the most widely CVBD distributed in Spain. However, veterinarians working in areas showing a high or medium endemicity considered that the incidence of CanL remains stable, while those working in low CanL endemic areas indicated that cases of CanL have increased. This perception is similar to that described in other European countries that were until recently free of CanL, such as the UK or Germany [36\u201339]. The reason for this is unknown, but could be due to (i) the increased transfer of infected dogs from endemic areas, such as rehomed or hunting dogs; (ii) more dogs travelling overseas to Leishmania-endemic areas (e.g. taken there by their owners on holiday); (iii) other non-vector routes of transmission such as vertical, venereal, blood transfusion or dog-to-dog [40\u201343] which may be contributing to the spread of autochthonous cases.

These rates are significantly higher than those of our previous survey [25], and indicate the improved clinical management of CanL as suggested by the LeishVet group [2, 21]. Regarding the use of urinalysis, ranges of 25.5\u201333.9% to 21.5\u201337.4% used urine strip and urinalysis, respectively. Also, 27.2\u201334.0% frequently or systematically, respectively, determined the UPC. This is important, as according to LeishVet and IRIS guidelines, UPC is a highly suitable biomarker for diagnosis of CanL because immunocomplex deposits in the renal glomerulus may induce immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. In sick dogs, this serious kidney lesion causes proteinuria with or without azotemia and chronic renal disease or even nephrotic syndrome of worse prognosis [68, 69]. Another important complementary diagnosis is abdominal ultrasound which was performed frequently during CanL follow-up by 6.4\u201314.6% of the veterinarians surveyed. These diagnostic methods (UPC and ultrasound) were not included in other surveys but the present responses suggest that veterinarians have access to this new information on the clinical management of CanL via the LeishVet guidelines, IRIS guidelines and specialized conferences [2, 21, 69, 70].",

The results of the present survey suggest veterinarians frequently use the combination of meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol, followed by miltefosine, in accordance with a previous questionnaire survey [47]. The long-term use of allopurinol, in combination with n-methylglucamine antimoniate or miltefosine, has proved to be effective for maintaining clinical and parasitological improvement and delaying relapses in treated dogs. Miltefosine is better tolerated with regard to liver and kidney function. There is scarce information regarding possible toxicity of antimonials, and some authors have suggested possible kidney and liver secondary effects [71\u201373]. It is also true, however, that disease relapse occurs much earlier in dogs treated with miltefosine [73, 74]. Therefore, although available data are controversial, miltefosine could be recommended for treatment of canine leishmaniosis patients with renal or liver disease, and/or when subcutaneous or parenteral therapy may not be administered or is not indicated [73\u201376].",

In this survey, 87.6% replied they recommended vaccination as a preventative measure. Further, it is remarkable that the most common vaccine used by veterinarians surveyed is LetiFend\u00ae and not Canileish\u00ae. This lower use than initially expected could be because its percentage effectiveness is c.70% [83]. In addition, Canileish\u00ae needs to be given for primovaccination as three consecutive doses three weeks apart to develop an adequate immune response while LetiFend\u00ae is a single dose even for primary vaccination. This vaccine is also a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccine, allowing to discriminate vaccinated from infected dogs. For all these reasons, LetiFend\u00ae is at the first-line vaccine option over Canileish\u00ae, as reflected in the results of other surveys [84\u201386].",

However, a high percentage of veterinarians stated they never performed any test before revaccination so it cannot be known if a dog has been infected during the inter-vaccination period. This test is strictly necessary since vaccines do not protect 100% [83]. On the other hand, the results of the present survey indicate that more veterinarians carry out rapid tests before vaccination. Although rapid tests have a good sensitivity and specificity, quantitative techniques are considered more sensitive. Thus, a quantitative test is always recommended before vaccination to ensure the vaccination of healthy animals, as sometimes dogs with low antibody titres are not detected using qualitative techniques [83, 89] due to their lower sensitivity.",

The educational role of veterinarians is essential to explain the life-cycle of the parasite and how other animals or people could acquire the infection, highlighting the importance of control and prevention measures [21, 22].
