The evidence came from the investigation of the 1977 outbreak in Zaire [10]. A serum sample obtained from a physician was found to be seropositive. In 1972, that physician developed a febrile illness associated with sore throat, headache, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, rash and leukopenia about 2 weeks after he lacerated his finger during an autopsy on a Zairois student who died from hemorrhagic illness.",

In a study testing blood samples collected from 4349 individuals from 220 randomly selected village in Gabon between 2005 and 2008, 15.3% of samples were found have ebolavirus-specific antibodies using ELISA [16]. Ebolavirus-specific antibodies can also be found in individuals from areas without apparent EVD outbreak. For example, ebolavirus-specific antibodies, detected using indirect immunofluorescence slide test, were found in 13.4% of healthy individuals from a rainforest area of Liberia in the early 1980s [17]. Though these serological test results have not been confirmed by neutralization antibody study, it is highly likely that asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections are much more common than severely symptomatic and fatal illness.",

The index patient was a 2-year-old child with fever, black stool, and vomiting, with symptom onset on December 2, 2013, and died 4 days later. The disease then spread to other villages of the Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou district, and also Macenta and Kissidougou district. The first peak occurred in March 2014 when patients were diagnosed with EVD in Liberia. The second peak occurred in May and June 2014, coinciding with the first report of cases from Sierra Leone. Contact tracing found that the initial cases in Sierra Leone attended a funeral of a highly respected \u201ctraditional healer\u201d, who has treated patients with EVD in Guinea [6], [18]. There was a large increase in cases since July 2014. The first case in Nigeria was a traveler from Liberia, who has caused an outbreak involving 19 laboratory-confirmed cases from July to September [19]. Senegal and Mali reported the first imported cases on August 29 and October 22, 2014, respectively [20]. The first case of EVD diagnosed outside Africa was confirmed on September 30, 2014 [3]. The patient, from Liberia, arrived in USA on September 20, and developed symptoms on September 24. A separate EVD outbreak, also caused by Zaire ebolavirus, has occurred in DRC since July 2014 [21]. As of October 25, 2014, the DRC outbreak has involved 67 cases with 49 deaths [22].",

Phylogenetic analysis using the whole genome sequences of 99 ebolavirus strains from 78 patients revealed that the 2014 West Africa EVD outbreak is caused by a Zaire ebolavirus lineage that is most closely related to the one causing the 2007 EVD outbreak in DRC [2]. Molecular dating suggested that this 2014 West African lineage likely diverged from the Central African lineage in 2004 [23]. Analysis of the ebolavirus strains from Guinea and Sierra Leone showed that they are highly similar, which is in agreement with the findings from contact tracing (Fig. 1\n). However, there are two distinct lineages of ebolavirus in Sierra Leone which were estimated to have diverged in April 2014. This finding suggests that the virus has further mutated either in Guinea or in Sierra Leone [23]. On the other hand, the ebolavirus strain causing the DRC EVD outbreak in July 2014 is another Zaire strain most closely related to 1995 DRC outbreak Zaire strain [21], confirming that this is a separate outbreak.",

            "text": "Humans can acquire the infection from infected animals or infected persons. The index patients of EVD outbreaks are usually persons working in forests, caves or mines. Many of these index patients are bushmeat hunters with direct contact with animals. In the natural setting, transmission from animals usually involves direct contact with the animal or handling of the carcasses. However, most humans acquire the infection through direct person-to-person transmission that can occur via direct contact with body fluids. Many clusters occurred when people attended the funeral of an infected patient [6], [18]. A case\u2013control study showed that household contacts with direct physical contact with the ill patient or cadaver and exposure to body fluids were risk factors for acquiring infections [25]. Ebolavirus can be transmitted directly through broken skin or mucous membranes from the blood, body fluid, and secretions of the infected person, as the virus could be detected in blood, urine, saliva, seminal fluid, breast milk, tears, stool, skin, and swabs from vagina, rectum and conjunctiva [26]. Virus shedding can be prolonged. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remained positive in the blood for up to 21 days, in the vaginal, rectal and conjunctival swab for up to 33 days, and in the seminal fluid for up to 101 days [27]. Live virus could be isolated from a patient's seminal fluid 82 days after symptom onset. Transmission through environmental surfaces is possible. It was shown that live ebolavirus can survive on dried glass or plastic surface for up to 50 days [28]. Studies have shown that lower temperature and higher absolute humidity are associated with EVD outbreaks [17]. Animal studies showed that other routes may be possible. Reston ebolavirus can be transmitted from pigs to cynomolgus macaques without direct contact, suggesting that ebolavirus can be transmitted from animal reservoirs to humans without direct contact [32]. Studies in rhesus macaques showed that ebolavirus given orally can cause fatal infections [33]. Aerosol transmission in macaques has been documented [34], but this route of transmission has not been documented in humans. Almost all cases in the current outbreak are related to person-to-person transmission. The effective reproduction numbers for the 2014 outbreak were estimated to be 1.71 for Guinea, 1.83 for Liberia, 1.20 for Nigeria, and 2.02 for Sierra Leone [5].",

The 3\u2032 end of the viral genome consists of a non-coding region, followed by 7 genes (nucleoprotein [NP], virion protein 35 [VP35], virion protein 40 [VP40], glycoprotein [GP], virion protein 30 [VP30], virion protein 24 [VP24], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [L]), and then a non-coding region at the 5\u2032 end. Each gene encodes one protein, except for the GP gene, which encodes three glycoproteins. The full-length GP is produced by RNA editing, in which the two reading frames are joined together by slippage of viral polymerase at an editing site, generating an mRNA transcript that allows read-through translation of GP. GP contains GP1 subunit for host cell receptor binding and the GP2 subunit for cell-virion membrane fusion. The soluble GP (sGP) is generated by an unedited transcript, which is much more abundant than GP [49]. A third protein, called small soluble GP (ssGP), is produced via RNA editing [50]. GP, VP24 and VP40 are associated with membrane, while NP, VP35, VP30, and L protein bind to the viral genome, which are required for viral genome replication and transcription. VP24 is also required for the assembly of nucleocapsid.",

            "text": "The viral life cycle starts when GP1 attaches to cell surface receptors [51], [52]. Although ebolavirus can bind to host cell surface dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (SIGN) (DC-SIGN), liver and lymph node SIGN (L-SIGN) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing 1 (TIM1), it is currently unclear which cell surface receptor is most important. After attachment, viral entry occurs via macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis [53]. After entry, the virus is then trafficked into endosome. Inside the endosome, several factors are required for the fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane to occur, including acidification of the endosome, and priming and triggering of the GP. Priming of GP occurs when GP1, which is bound to GP2, is cleaved into the 20 kDa GP1 by cathepsin L and then to 19 kDa by cathepsin B. Triggering occurs when the 19 kDa GP1 undergoes conformational change to expose the fusion loop [52]. Another important event in the fusion step is the binding of the endosomal membrane protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), to cleaved GP1 [54]. Viral genome replication and transcription then take place in the cytoplasm, which require the viral polymerase L protein, VP35, VP30 and NP. VP24 is required for nucleocapsid formation and assembly. Viral transcription is also regulated by VP40 [55]. The GP, after modification in the Golgi, is trafficked to the plasma membrane, where it is associated with other proteins. Virus budding and release then occur, and require the matrix protein VP40.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that the sGP is important in the modulation of host inflammatory response and immune defense. In vitro, sGP can inhibit the neutralizing activity of anti-GP antibody [58]. sGP also subverts anti-GP immune response by inducing a host antibody that competes for the binding site of anti-GP antibody [59]. sGP can also interact with neutrophils, although the receptor for this interaction is controversial [60], [61]. On the other hand, sGP may limit the virulence of the virus. Recombinant ebolavirus without sGP are less cytotoxic than those with sGP [56]. sGP can protect endothelial cells from TNF-\u03b1 [62]. sGP can also bind to GP2, but the importance of this finding requires further study [63]. VP35 also inhibits the innate immune RIG-I signaling, interferon(IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 production, and dendritic cell maturation [64]. VP24 is important in the inhibition of IFN signaling [65], [66].",

Hemorrhagic phenomenon then appears, which can include petechiae or ecchymoses, uncontrolled oozing from venipuncture sites, and mucosal hemorrhages. However, it should be noted that massive hemorrhage occurs in fewer than half of patients and is seldom the cause of death. In the 2014 outbreak, unexplained bleeding was reported in only 18% of patients [5]. Hypovolemia can develop rapidly. As in other causes of severe sepsis, complications including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and multi-organ failure can occur. Death usually occurs between days 7 and 16 after symptom onset.

Antigen-capture ELISA can also be used on blood samples, but is less sensitive than RT-PCR [93]. A rapid immunochromatographic assay for the detection of ebolavirus antigen, which claimed to provide result in 15 min, was recently announced by the France's Atomic Energy Commission [95]. Viral culture from the blood using Vero E6 is usually positive in the acute stage, but should not be performed except in biosafety level 4 facilities. Viral particles may be seen in the serum under electron microscope, which was used in the confirmation of the first cases in the current outbreak [2]. Other than blood samples and oral fluids, the virus can also be detected in other body fluids, but these are not usually used for diagnosis. Serum IgM is useful during the convalescent phase, but is not useful in the acute setting. Serum IgG is not reliable, as one study showed that 4 out of 18 survivors did not have detectable IgG levels at the time when viral antigen was no longer detected [93].",

            "text": "There are currently no licensed antiviral drugs to treat EVD. Before the 2014 outbreak, specific therapy has been used in humans with some success. During the 1976 EVD outbreak, a male investigator pricked himself while transferring homogenized liver from an infected guinea pig [30]. Six days after the injury, he developed fever, central abdominal pain and nausea. On the same day, he started to receive a 14-day course of human IFN 3 million units every 12 h administered intramuscularly. The human IFN was prepared by stimulating peripheral lymphocytes with Sendai virus in vitro. On day 8 after the injury, he received 450 ml of convalescent sera which was obtained from infected people from Zaire, and the viral load was reduced from 104.5 guinea-pig infective units per ml to 3-10 guinea-pig infective units per ml. On day 11 after the injury, he received the 2nd infusion of convalescent sera. He eventually recovered. Subsequently in the 1995 ebolavirus outbreak in Kikwit, 7 of 8 patients who received blood donated from 5 convalescent patients survived [97]. Both convalescent plasma and IFN-\u03b2 were later tested in rhesus macaques, but only convalescent plasma was found to improve survival [98], [99]. In the 2014 EVD outbreak, convalescent plasma has been given to several patients, but the efficacy of convalescent plasma remains to be determined.",

            "text": "In addition to convalescent plasma and IFN-\u03b2, several experimental treatments have been shown to improve survival in non-human primates (Table 3\n). The first strategy employs the antiviral effect of neutralizing antibodies, either through direct administration of the antibodies or through active immunization. Monoclonal antibody cocktails targeting different sites of the ebolavirus were shown to protect primates [68], [82], [83]. ZMapp, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies that are originally contained in the preparation MB-003 (consisting of human or human-mouse chimeric mAbs c13C6, h13F6 and c6D8), and ZMab (consisting of murine mAbs m1H3, m2G4 and m4G7 targeting GP) have been shown to protect rhesus macaques from lethal challenge when given up to 5 days post infection [82]. Post-exposure vaccine, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine, can elicit anti-GP antibodies and improve the survival of rhesus macaques when given 20\u201330 min post infection [100]. The second strategy is to inhibit the activity of virus proteins. Antisense oligonucleotides target the viral L protein and VP proteins, can also improve survival of infected rhesus macaques [101], [102]. The third strategy aims to ameliorate the deleterious host immune response. Recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 and recombinant human activated protein C could alleviate the coagulopathy and improve survival in animal models [103], [104]. However, the clinical efficacy of recombinant human activated protein C is questioned because a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study did not show survival benefit in patients with septic shock [105]. Among these experimental treatments, monoclonal antibody cocktail (ZMapp) and small interfering RNA (Tkm-Ebola) have been used in patients during the current 2014 outbreak [106], [107]. Both antibody and RNA-based therapy might be limited to a particular species, and may become ineffective if there are mutations affecting the related antigenic epitopes or gene targets. The efficacy of these experimental treatments in humans remains to be determined.",

The IC50 of clomiphene, chloroquine and imatinib are above the peak serum level in humans, and therefore these are unlikely useful clinically. Both toremifene and favipiravir had peak serum levels above the IC50, and both of these drugs have shown to improve survival in mouse models [109], [110]. Toremifene can achieve plasma concentrations of about 10 \u03bcM at a high dose of 600 mg/day that are inhibitory in cell culture (IC50 1\u20134 \u03bcM in Vero cells). However the murine model utilizing a high dose of 60 mg/kg initiated at 1 h post infection can only achieve a 50% survival [109]. Moreover prolonged QTc changes have been reported at a dose of 300 mg once daily [114]. Thus clinical trials should consider dosage adjustment, cardiac and electrolyte monitoring. Favipiravir also appears effective in mice model, and has been administered to a patient in France [115]. Although the efficacy of these drugs in humans is uncertain especially when non-human primate treatment data are not available, they may be considered when better options are not available and the benefit-risk ratio is favorable.",

They are required to put on the PPE in the following sequence, from N95 respirator, water repellent cap or hood, full length shoe cover or boot, water resistant gown, face shield, and long nitrile gloves. If the patient has hemorrhagic symptoms, double nitrile gloves should be worn. In view of the high virulence and mortality, patients suspected to have EVD should be isolated in airborne isolation room in the developed countries, although WHO allows cohorted nursing in the designated areas with dedicated instruments, where access should be restricted in the developing countries with limited isolation facilities [123].",

On August 8, 2014, WHO declares the EVD outbreak in West Africa a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d. Preparedness and response plan were made available in most of the health authorities all over the world. The aim is to detect the first imported case for early isolation in order to prevent local transmission in the community and healthcare setting. Risk assessment in the port health, emergency room, and outpatient clinics for any patient fulfilling both clinical and epidemiological criteria for EVD is important. For the clinical definition, patient suffering from a sudden onset of fever with over 38 \u00b0C, or having at least one of the following signs including inexplicable bleeding, bloody diarrhea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin or eye, or hematuria should be alerted, while the epidemiological definition includes close contact with a confirmed or probable case of EVD or resided in or history of travel to an affected area or countries within 21 days before onset of symptoms. For healthcare workers working in volunteer medical services or non-government organizations, who have direct contact with patients in the affected areas or countries, should also perform medical surveillance for at least 21 days after leaving the affected areas or countries. They are required to seek medical advice promptly if there are any symptoms of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash or bleeding during medical surveillance.",

Many patients with symptom did not seek medical care because of the fear of contracting the disease from the hospital [124]. Therefore, the local governments and health authorities should focus on the health education and give a clear instruction to the person for seeking early medical attention in the unaffected areas of Africa. However, when the community transmission of ebolavirus is uncontrolled, implementation of home quarantine for up to 21 days (one incubation period) can be considered. Home quarantine measure had been used to control the community spread of SARS in Beijing, Taiwan, Singapore, and Toronto [125]. However, the public health staff is expected to face unprecedented challenges in implementing an extensive quarantine policy, as they have a dual role of monitoring compliance and providing support of daily necessities to people in quarantine. The countries next to the affected areas require implementing border control measures to screen for any suspected case of ebolavirus. Although these measures may adversely affect the international travel and economy, it may be worthwhile to implement such a strict measure to control this re-emerging infectious disease with high mortality and psychological fear in a timely manner.",

One of the major differences from previous outbreaks is that it has affected crowded major cities in West Africa where the infrastructure has been heavily damaged due to civil wars. The rapid spread is facilitated by the efficient person-to-person transmission due to high viral loads in blood, bodily secretions and the contaminated environment. The large amount of virus particles shed in body fluid makes this virus very contagious, even among healthcare workers who are already equipped with PPE. Whole genome study showed that the current West Africa ebolavirus strain is phylogenetically distinct from previous outbreak strains, and this current ebolavirus strain has higher mutation rate than previous strains.
