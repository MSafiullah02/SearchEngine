The use of botulinum toxin as a bioweapon would cause \"inhalational botulism,\" which in essence is an \"intoxication\" rather than an infection, and therefore will not be discussed here.",

In this regard, the scientific community is in the presence of great challenges and unprecedented opportunities. The outcome of the renewed scientific initiatives on bioterrorism will undoubtedly be a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and host interactions of these pathogens, as well as the identification of new targets for the development of efficacious prophylaxis and therapeutics.

            "text": "Anthrax is caused by the Gram-positive bacterium B. anthracis. In nature, anthrax is a disease that herbivores or other mammals acquire after contact with B. anthracis spores present in soil. Human disease results from contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, or after exposure to accidentally or intentionally released spores. Anthrax was originally called Woolsorter's disease because it occurred most frequently in people who worked in animal textile mills. B. anthracis derives its name from the morphology of the microscopic bacterium (baculum, Latin for rod), and the dry, black appearance of cutaneous anthrax lesions (anthrakis, Greek for coal). Beginning in 1972, nations around the globe signed a treaty at the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention banning the research of biological weapons for offensive purposes. Despite this written agreement, many nations secretly continued to develop bioweapons (Cole, 1996) . In April and May of 1979 a military facility in the northwest region of Sverdlovsk, U.S.S.R. (now Ekaterinburg), accidentally released B. anthracis spores into the air. Prevailing winds carried the spores into the nearby town resulting in 96 reported cases of pulmonary anthrax and at least 64 deaths (Meselson et al., 1994) . Russian officials initially claimed that most of the cases were gastrointestinal anthrax acquired as a result of consumption of contaminated meat; however, subsequent laboratory analyses of patient samples and epidemiological studies concluded that the infections resulted from inhalation of aerosolized spores originating from the nearby military base (Bezdenezhnykh and Nikiforov, 1980; Meselson et al., 1994) . This was the first known incident of human infection resulting from weaponized B. anthracis spores. Most recently, in October 2001, 22 individuals became infected with anthrax after the intentional release of spores through the U.S. mail. As a result, 11 confirmed cases of inhalation anthrax and 11 confirmed or suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax were diagnosed. There were 5 fatalities, and prophylactic antibiotics were recommended to approximately 10,000 people (Shepard et al., 2002) . The fifth and final pulmonary anthrax fatality occurred months after the initial cases in a 94-year-old Connecticut woman who could not be directly linked to a known infectious source (Jernigan et al., 2001) . Since this chapter deals specifically with agents of biowarfare capability, the majority of this section will focus on pulmonary anthrax.",

            "text": "Three distinct clinical forms of anthrax disease can develop in humans depending on the mode of infection (Figure 1 ). Cutaneous anthrax is the most common type of infection, usually acquired by people who are in frequent contact with infected animals or animal products. Disease results after entry of infectious spores into abrasions or cuts in the skin. Initially the infection appears as a small painless lesion that resembles an insect bite. The lesion is often pruritic, and develops into a larger inflamed papule. The raised area results from local fluid accumulation, caused at least in part by the action of anthrax toxins. As the tissue becomes necrotic, a dry black eschar forms and eventually dries and sloughs off a few weeks after formation (Kalamas, 2004) . Antibiotic treatment confers a 99% survival rate for patients diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax (Karwa et al., 2003) . Dissemination to the bloodstream can occur in the absence of treatment, but is very rare if treatment is sought promptly. Gastrointestinal anthrax results from the ingestion of meat contaminated with B. anthracis spores. The infection is characterized by the presence of ulcers, massive edema, and necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. This is the rarest form of anthrax and, although treatable when diagnosed promptly, death can occur due to intestinal perforation and systemic dissemination of the toxins. FIGURE 1. Bacillus anthracis endospores reach a primary site in the subcutaneous layer, gastrointestinal mucosa, or alveolar spaces. For cutaneous and gastrointestinal anthrax, low-level germination occurs at the primary site, leading to local edema, necrosis and, occasionally, to systemic spread. In cases of pulmonary anthrax, peribronchial hemorrhagic lymphadenitis blocks pulmonary lymphatic drainage, leading to pulmonary edema. Death results from septicemia, toxemia, or pulmonary complications. The action of Edema toxin and Lethal toxin are shown on the right. (Reproduced with permission from Dixon et al., 1999.) Pulmonary anthrax is the most serious manifestation of the disease and results from inhalation of aerosolized B. anthracis spores. To induce a productive infection, the spores must reach the alveolar spaces of the lung where resident macrophages phagocytize them and germination occurs. To reach the alveolar spaces and avoid the mechanical innate barriers of the host, spores must be between 1\u00b5m and 5\u00b5m in diameter (Hatch, 1961) . This requirement represents one of the major technological hurdles for the \"weaponization\" of B. anthracis and may be one of the reasons why weaponized anthrax can only be produced with considerable financial and technological resources. Pulmonary anthrax is the most likely outcome in instances of biological warfare, since once the microscopic spores are released in the environment they can be rapidly disseminated and inhaled by humans (Jernigan et al., 2001; Meselson et al., 1994) . Although pulmonary anthrax is highly fatal and easily contracted from aerosolized spores, it has not been shown to be transmissible from person to person and is thus limited in its ability to cause mass casualties. This is in contrast to pneumonic plague, which can be acquired after inhalation of aerosolized infectious bacteria and subsequently disseminated from infected individuals to close contacts.",

From studies in a murine model it was determined that germination begins within 1 h of intranasal or intratracheal inoculation, and after 5 h vegetative bacilli can be found in regional lymph nodes (Lyons et al., 2004) . Some of the sporecontaining macrophages migrate to the peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes where vegetative bacilli continue to replicate and induce initial hemorrhagic mediastinitis (Abramova et al., 1993) . Once outside macrophages, the bacilli multiply rapidly, and synthesize copious amounts of toxins that are hematogenously disseminated, leading to the clinical manifestations and the mortality associated with the disease. Pulmonary anthrax has been described as a biphasic illness in which the initial symptoms occur within days of infection (Abramova et al., 1993; Brookmeyer et al., 2005) . Symptoms in the first phase are nondistinct, resemble a mild flu infection, and include fever, chills, headache, cough, and malaise. The second phase is a fulminant disease characterized by chest pain, and significant respiratory distress evident by severe cough, shortness of breath, and harsh, labored respiration (Kalamas, 2004) . In the absence of treatment, death often follows 2-3 days after onset of the severe symptoms. Characteristic clinical presentations of pulmonary anthrax include pleural effusions and mediastinal widening observed on chest Xradiograms Jernigan et al., 2001) . Death apparently results from multiorgan failure similar to systemic shock.",

Plasmid pXO1, originally named pBA1, is 184 kb and contains the genes necessary for synthesis of the three components of the anthrax toxins. Also present on pXO1 is the atxA gene, which encodes a transactivator protein involved in the regulation of many B. anthracis genes (Bourgogne et al., 2003; Dai et al., 1995; Uchida et al., 1993) . Experimental evidence indicates that the primary determinant of anthrax virulence is the presence of lethal factor (LF) and protective antigen (PA) which together form LeTx (Beall et al., 1962; Cataldi et al., 1990; Ezzell et al., 1984; Klimpel et al., 1994; Park et al., 2002; Pezard et al., 1991; Pitt et al., 2001; Reuveny et al., 2001) . The other virulence plasmid, pXO2, contains the genes responsible for synthesis of the bacterial capsule (Green et al., 1985) .",

Although the exact role of the capsule in infection has not been elucidated, it is known to be effective at preventing phagocytosis by macrophages and is also necessary for bacterial systemic dissemination (Drysdale et al., 2005; Makino et al., 1989) . The enzymes responsible for capsule synthesis are encoded by the genes capA, capB, capC, and capD located on the 96 kb pXO2 virulence plasmid (Makino et al., 1989 (Makino et al., , 2002 . Collectively these four genes make up the capBCAD operon. A strain with the capBCAD operon deleted is highly attenuated in a murine model of inhalation anthrax (Drysdale et al., 2005) . Since the capsular material has been shown to be poorly immunogenic, it is believed that the capsule is necessary to avoid recognition by antibodies in vivo, and therefore the lack of capsule can result in accelerated clearance by the host (Leonard and Thorne, 1961) . It has been postulated that pXO2 may carry other genes important for the virulence of the organism. Transposon mutagenesis of pXO2 produced mutants that synthesized wild-type levels of capsule in vitro but exhibited reduced virulence when injected subcutaneously in mice (Welkos, 1991) .",

EdTx and LeTx conform to the classical model of bacterial A-B toxins, since both are composed of a receptor-binding B subunit and a catalytically active A subunit. Unlike most binary toxins, the two components are not covalently linked, but instead exist as three separate proteins, before binding to the host cell. Initial binding to the host cell receptor is accomplished by the 83 kDa protective antigen (PA) protein encoded by the pagA gene located on virulence plasmid pXO1 (Vodkin and Leppla, 1983) . The recently identified receptors for anthrax toxin are the tumor endothelial marker (TEM8) (Bradley et al., 2001) and the capillary morphogenesis pro-tein2 (CMG2) (Scobie et al., 2003) . These receptors are present in a broad range of tissues and contain a common extracellular von Willebrand factor type A domain, also called integrin-like domain (I-domain), which constitutes the PA binding site. The crystal structure of the interaction between PA and its receptors has been described in detail (Santelli et al., 2004) .",

The larger peptide (63 kDa) left on the cell surface, assembles into heptamers that can bind to either of the two A subunits: edema factor (EF) or lethal factor (LF); or some combination of the two (Pimental et al., 2004) , producing a functional toxin molecule. PA-deficient strains of B. anthracis are avirulent in animal models attesting to the importance of the binding subunit in toxin-mediated pathogenesis (Cataldi et al., 1990; Pezard et al., 1991) . When a molecule of LF attaches to a bound, activated molecule of PA, the complex is referred to as LeTx (lethal toxin). If a molecule of EF binds, the resulting complex is called EdTx (edema toxin). B. anthracis is unique in this respect since both catalytic proteins share the same binding subunit. Current evidence suggests that a maximum of three ligand molecules can bind per each heptamer, although it is not known if both EF and LF can bind simultaneously to one heptamer Mogridge et al., 2002; Mourez, 2004) . Following binding of the EF or LF subunits, the cell engulfs the PA/LF/EF complex via receptormediated endocytosis (Gordon et al., 1988) . Each member of the PA heptamer then inserts a \u03b2-barrel hairpin loop into the vesicle membrane forming a pore that allows the translocation of the catalytic subunit(s) to the cytosol where they initiate their toxic effects (Nassi et al., 2002) . Acidification of the endosome has been shown to be essential for the toxic effects in vitro suggesting that formation of the pore and/or translocation of the A subunit is pH-dependent (Friedlander, 1986; Milne et al., 1994) . The insertion of PA into the membrane seems to occur soon after the toxin complex is internalized, while the delivery of LF or EF to the cytosol is a later event in the endocytic pathway (Abrami et al., 2004) (Figure 2 ).",

These residues make up the HExxH consensus sequence, a motif that is common to many metalloproteases (Klimpel et al., 1994) . It is likely that the PA subunit of LeTx exists Protective antigen binds to a cellular receptor and is activated by a furin-like protease. The PA 63 fragment oligomerizes on the cell surface to form a ring-shaped heptamer, which binds lethal factor (LF), edema factor (EF), or both. The complexes are endocytosed and trafficked to an acidic compartment. Subsequently, the heptamer inserts into the membrane and forms a transmembrane pathway for transfer of EF and LF to the cytosol, where they catalyze their respective reactions. PA, protective antigen; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

In 1986 Friedlander observed that LeTx could induce rapid lysis of certain murine macrophages, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Friedlander, 1986) . This observation gave rise to the hypothesis that macrophages play an important role in the progression of the disease and that a cascade of macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines was responsible for the shock-like effects observed in toxin-challenged animals. However, this theory is currently the subject of intense debate, because it is now known that humans or certain animals that are very sensitive to both anthrax infection and anthrax toxin have macrophages that are resistant to the action of the toxin in vivo (Cui et al., 2004; Friedlander et al., 1993a; Moayeri et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 1998) . Therefore, LeTx-mediated death cannot be explained solely as a result of macrophage cytotoxicity. The observations that (1) LF negative strains of B. anthracis are avirulent in animals and (2) catalytically inactive LF mutants fail to cleave MAPKK members in vitro suggest that a strong correlation exists between the disruption of intracellular signaling events by LF and the mortality caused by LeTx (Duesbery et al., 1998; Pezard et al., 1991) .",

Direct injection of purified EdTx into animals results in local fluid accumulation and swelling (Stanley and Smith, 1961) . It has been suggested that an important function of EdTx may be the functional suppression of neutrophils. This was demonstrated when EdTx-treated neutrophils showed a decreased ability to phagocytose killed and opsonized B. anthracis (O'Brien et al., 1985) . Theoretically, this would aid in survival and spread of the bacteria, and in conjunction with LeTx would disable the first line of protection against infection. The contribution of EdTx to systemic anthrax is not known, but it is assumed that the most significant role for EdTx is in the cutaneous form of the disease. A possible synergistic effect of the two toxins on the host immune system has also been proposed (Pezard et al., 1991; Smith and Stoner, 1967 ).",

Consistent with the importance of atxA in toxin gene expression is the observation that an atxA-null mutant is avirulent in mice (Dai et al., 1995) . Shortly after atxA was identified, work by a separate group noted that temperature and CO 2 levels also influence toxin gene expression (Sirard et al., 1994) . This is not surprising since germination of spores in the lungs of susceptible individuals is closely followed by toxin production. It is very likely that bacteria use the change in temperature and CO 2 levels as stimulus to turn on molecular switches that upregulate genes necessary for vegetative growth and protection against immune effector cells. One possible explanation is that temperature and/or CO 2 levels affect atxA expression, which in turn leads to toxin production. A later publication reported that temperature affected production of the transactivator protein but CO 2 levels did not (Dai and Koehler, 1997; Dai et al., 1995; Uchida et al., 1993 ).",

It was licensed by the FDA in 1970 and is currently provided only to military personnel, individuals at high risk of occupational exposure, and to those recently exposed or suspected to have been exposed to aerosolized spores. The vaccine is derived from the cell-free filtrate of a nonencapsulated strain of B. anthracis. Although AVA contains multiple bacteria and media-derived components, the primary immunogen is PAadsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Ivins et al., 1996) . This vaccine is far from ideal because it requires multiple vaccine doses and it has been reported to induce adverse effects in some vaccinees (Belyakov et al., 2000; Kerrison et al., 2002) Patients receiving AVA are administered three subcutaneous injections at 0, 2, and 4 weeks followed by three more injections at 6, 12, and 18 months. In addition to the 6 injections, annual boosters are recommended for as long as immunity is required. Since immunological memory to PA in the absence of anti-PA antibodies is not necessarily protective in animal models, annual boosters are recommended to prevent titers from falling below minimal protective levels, which could leave vaccinated individuals at risk of infection. Intramuscular vaccination with AVA induces primarily a systemic immune response characterized by high serum IgG levels capable of efficiently neutralizing toxin in passive transfer experiments (Sawada-Hirai et al., 2004) . Studies in rhesus macaques have demonstrated that animals vaccinated with AVA were protected against aerosol challenge with 93 lethal doses (LD50) of the highly virulent Ames strain of B. anthracis (Ivins et al., 1998) . Challenge studies in nonhuman primates represent the most reliable data available regarding the efficacy of AVA in humans since there are no confirmed cases of AVA vaccinees being exposed to infectious spores.",

Both vaccines are administered parenterally (intramuscular injection) and provide robust systemic immunity but limited mucosal or cell-mediated immunity. Since most microorganisms typically enter via mucosal surfaces, it is believed that local immunity may aid in preventing the initial establishment of infection and, in combination with systemic immunity, increase the minimal infectious dose required to cause disease. Advances in protein purification, adjuvants, immunology, and vaccinology have provided opportunities for researchers to design more effective vaccines that can be administered through nonparenteral (needle-free) routes and that potentially provide both mucosal and systemic immunity to pathogens.",

Besides the obvious benefit of vaccinating people with well-defined formulations, expression of PA from vectors other than B. anthracis is safer and easier to standardize. In anticipation of phase I clinical trials, researchers at the National Cancer Institute have demonstrated successful adsorption and desorption of recombinant PA (rPA) to FDA-approved adjuvants with little loss of biologic viability (Jendrek et al., 2003) . Other researchers have characterized the immune response to intranasal immunization using rPA in combination with various experimental adjuvants (Boyaka et al., 2003) . Intranasal immunization of mice using cholera toxin (CT) as adjuvant elicited mucosal and systemic IgG responses as well as high levels of type 2 cytokines. Other novel approaches to vaccination include the use of transcutaneous immunization using a patchbased vaccine with Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT) adjuvant (Kenney et al., 2004) .",

Humans are accidental hosts and are commonly infected after the bite of an infected flea or via respiratory droplets from animals to humans or between humans. Y. pestis is believed to be responsible for the great epidemic of \"Black Death\" which killed millions of people in Europe in the Middle Ages.

Although many unconfirmed records of ancient plague epidemics abound in the literature, it is known that the first recorded pandemic or \"Justinian\" plague (AD 541-767) started in Egypt and spread to Europe and Africa. The second pandemic, known as the 'Black Death' (1346 to the early 1600s) spread from the Caspian Sea to Europe, and the third pandemic began in 1855 in the Yunnan region of China and spread globally via ships leaving from Hong Kong (Achtman et al., 1999; Perry and Fetherston, 1997) .",

Pneumonic plague is transmitted from human to human through respiratory droplets or by artificially generated aerosols. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis are transmitted orally and enter the lymphatic system through the M cells of the small intestine. (Reproduced with permission from Wren, 2003.) The bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease and occurs following a bite from a flea that has previously taken a blood meal from an infected animal (Brubaker, 2003) . Y. pestis disseminates from the initial site of infection and drains to the local lymph nodes, especially axillary or inguinal, which rapidly become swollen, necrotic and painful. The swollen lymph nodes, known as \"buboes\", can get larger than a golf ball and constitute the classical pathognomonic feature of bubonic plague. Bacteremia often develops as bacteria from the bubo spill into the bloodstream, and large numbers of bacteria can be usually cultured from the blood (Butler, 1989; Crook and Tempest, 1992) .",

When a flea ingests blood containing Y. pestis, the bacteria start multiplying rapidly in the midgut of the insect. Two days after ingestion of infected blood, the stomach of the fleas have large masses containing fibrin, hemin, and bacteria, which continue to grow over a period of about 1 week. This produces a \"blockage\" that prevents the flea from ingesting food. To avoid starvation the insect needs to get rid of the blocking material by regurgitating the Y. pestis-laden mass. As the flea takes its next meal, it delivers the bacteria onto the wounded skin of the host (Gage and Kosoy, 2004).",

In 1994, Motin demonstrated passive immunity mediated by antibodies against a staphylococcal A-LcrV fusion (PAV) (Motin et al., 1994) . He also showed that injection of PAV prevented upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 by LcrV-deficient mutants, providing additional evidence that this protein blocks the inflammatory response (Nakajima et al., 1995) . It has since been shown that V-antigen serves two broad functions. First, V antigen (along with YopB and YopD) is responsible for selective targeting of effector proteins into the cytosol of infected cells by the type III secretion system (Cornelis, 2000; Cornelis et al., 1998) . Second, V antigen is secreted into the environment (Fields et al., 1999) , and can act on macrophages to induce the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 (Sing et al., 2002a) .

Circulating anti-F1 and anti-V antibody presumably functions to bind surface-exposed or secreted Y. pestis proteins. It is known that innate immune responses are necessary to resolve the necrotic lesion(s) caused by a natural Y. pestis infection (Brubaker, 2003) . However, upon Y. pestis infection, the V antigen inhibits innate immunity by inducing upregulation of IL-10 and downregulation of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, thereby preventing granuloma formation and instead allowing the development of necrotic lesions (Moore et al., 2001; Wang et al., 1995) . This dramatic decrease of Th1 cytokines is shown to be very characteristic of plague. Studies have shown that passive administration of anti-V serum prevents the downregulation of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 (Nakajima and Brubaker, 1993; Nakajima et al., 1995) . A vaccine that generates a type 2 antibody response against V antigen could conceivably protect against disease by neutralizing the physical and chemical effects of the V antigen on innate immunity. A positive correlation between decreasing levels of antibody titers, especially IgG1, and decreasing protection against challenge has been established .",

Of these, the subspecies tularensis is the most virulent, with an infectious dose of less than 10 CFU and a mortality rate of 5-30% in the absence of treatment. Subspecies holartica and mediasiatica have low virulence, and subspecies novicida is only reported to cause disease in immunocompromised humans (Ellis et al., 2002; Titball et al., 2003) .",

Infection might occur after: the bite from an infected insect, handling infected animal carcasses, drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated meat, or inhaling infectious aerosolized droplets. The route and site of transmission, the virulence of the infecting organism, and the immune status of the host determine the clinical presentation of the disease. The incidence of tularemia is higher in people with an occupational risk, such as hunters, butchers, farmers, and laboratory workers Feldman et al., 2001; Lawler, 2005) . The six clinical types of tularemia described have significant symptomatology overlap between them (Lamps et al., 2004) . The clinical presentations are: ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoidal, and septic tularemia. The pneumonic form is the most severe and has the highest rate of mortality, but most clinical types can include pulmonary involvement.",

Francisella LPS displays phase variation in vitro, producing phenotypically distinct colonies. However, the significance of this LPS change to virulence and to human disease is not known (Cowley et al., 1996) .

Although many of the potential biothreats have this capacity, the most feared biowarfare agents are those that are highly infectious and can disseminate from person to person. Among the three category A bacterial pathogens discussed here, Y. pestis is the only one that can be spread by aerosol droplets between humans. 4. Considering that several bacterial biowarfare agents are easily obtainable from nature, why do you think there have not been many instances of successful mass bioterrorism using these agents?",
