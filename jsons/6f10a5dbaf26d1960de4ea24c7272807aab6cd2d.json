But, following complaints from families and campaigners, NICE has said it will reissue its guidance. NICE's national guidance for the NHS, published on Friday, advised doctors on how to choose who gets life-saving intensive care treatment such as ventilation in the event of critical care services being overwhelmed during a surge of Covid-19 patients. It included a frailty score that told hospitals to \"assess all adults for frailty, irrespective of age and Covid-19 status\" using a nine-point frailty scoring system with people \"completely dependent for personal care, from whatever cause\" scoring seven. Anyone scoring higher than five was said to have uncertainty around the benefits of critical care. Despite NICE accepting the guidance is wrong, at the time of publishing, it had yet to remove the incorrect documents from its website.\"",

A health care system or a professional body such as the BMA, which prioritizes \"a higher survival probability,\" or an influential advisory body such as NICE which formulates a points scoring system for eligibility for treatment, and which stipulates that \"anyone scoring higher than five\" would have doubtful benefits from critical care, are both, to put it politely, playing fast and loose with the concepts of \"benefit\" and of what constitutes health improvement. Even for a moment to include \"patients with learning disabilities, autism, and other limiting conditions as scoring high for frailty\" when NICE classes \"frailty\" as a treatment disqualifying factor, the effect is to remove 'frail' citizens from the ambit of moral and professional concern, to exclude them from the rule of rescue. 3 To be sure, interventions confined to the easiest and cheapest to treat and to those most likely to recover, are well calculated to have impressive survival rates for their treatment regimes; successes perhaps second only to regimes that only accept patients who are entirely without injury or disease! No rational or halfway decent person will want or accept the terrible moral and human cost of abandoning those who need their assistance most; least of all those whom they have committed to treat by accepting them as patients or by assessing them in \"Accident and Emergency,\" the \"Emergency Room\" or clinic, and knowing that something can be done to improve their condition.",

Moreover that it does not and cannot justify deliberately bringing about the death of one individual to preserve the life or lives of others. This case involved the deliberate and callous sacrifice of the cabin boy, the weakest of a party of starving shipwrecked sailors. In July 1884, Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens were adrift in a tiny boat with two other survivors, the cabin boy Richard Parker and a fourth man Edmund Brooks. When the cabin boy fell into a coma and was much weakened and likely to die, Dudley and Stephens decided to kill him for food to save their own lives and that of Brooks (who took no part in the plan). They apparently believed they could not wait for him to die because killing Parker before his natural death would better preserve his blood to drink and hence give the others a better chance of survival. Not long after the cabin boy had been killed and eaten (probably 4 days later), the survivors were rescued. On return home, Dudley and Stephens were tried for murder and sentenced to hang; but were eventually reprieved (though not exonerated) and in fact served only 6 months in prison.",

But the temptation to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called necessity. Nor is this to be regretted. Though law and morality are not the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it\u2026\"",

This thing is of course 'the rest of our lives'. So long as we do not know the date of our deaths then for each of us the 'rest of our lives' is of indefinite duration. Whether we are 17 or 70, in perfect health or suffering from a terminal disease we each have the rest of our lives to lead. So long as we each wish to live out the rest of our lives, however long that turns out to be, then if we do not deserve to die, we each suffer the same injustice if our wishes are deliberately frustrated and we are cut off prematurely. 6 As Mars Jones insisted, people value particular events within their life disproportionately to the time required to experience those events. Without having available the vast detail of each person's life and their hopes and aspirations within that detail, we cannot hope to do justice between lives. The only sensible alternative is to count each life for one and none for more than one, whatever the differences in age and in other quality of life considerations. It is this outlook that explains why murder is always wrong, and wrong to the same degree, regardless of the age or health state of the victim. When you rob someone of life you take from them not only all they have, but all they will ever have. This is a difference in degree so radical that it makes for a difference in the quality of the act. However, the wrongfulness consists in taking from them something that they do not want to lose, and usually dread losing more than anything else they value.",

Other methods, including the ones so recklessly advocated by the BMA, and espoused by NICE give opportunities for prejudice and arbitrary preference free rein. 7 It is an extreme irony that the BMA, who have for so long resisted voluntary physician assisted death for people who actually wish to die and who have good reasons to fulfil that wish, should now be suggesting the legitimacy of withholding or withdrawing treatment from people who have no wish to die. In this crisis, we all need good fortune, but what we do not need or, I suggest want, is the dice to be deliberately loaded against us. We may be more ill than someone else, but if treatment is \"stabilizing\" or \"improving\" our condition, then treatment is by no means a waste of time or of resources, and all are entitled to an equal chance of receiving that treatment, even if all cannot actually receive it.",
