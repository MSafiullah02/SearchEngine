One day after transfection, the cells were mixed to allow cell-cell fusion, and medium was supplemented with PCI at 1 \u00b5M final concentration.

Quantification of infectious particles was done by plaque assay, using Vero B4 cells as published elsewhere [6]. Briefly, 10-fold dilutions of supernatants were tested in duplicates, using cell monolayers of Vero B4 cells. After 1 hour of virus adsorption, cells were washed and overlayed with a 1.2% avicel resin. After 3 days, the plates were fixed with 7% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet solution. To investigate the influence of PCI on the formation of MERS-CoV\u2013induced cytopathogenic effects, Vero B4 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 and fixed with 7% paraformaldehyde 42 hours after infection. MERS-CoV antigen detection was performed by incubation with a serum specimen from a patient with MERS as described elsewhere [30].

            "text": "Inspection of the sequences located at the border of the S1 and S2 subunits of MERS-S revealed the presence of 4 RXXR sequences (Figure 2A), which might represent recognition sites for proprotein convertases [22]. To determine the importance of these motifs for MERS-S cleavage, we changed the arginine residues in 626-RXXR-629, 691-RXXR-694, 748-RXXR-751, and 884-RXXR-887 to alanine residues, creating the potential cleavage site mutants PCM1, PCM2, PCM3, and PCM4 (Figure 2A). All S protein mutants were expressed with the same efficiency as wild-type MERS-S in transfected cells (Figure 2B). The only exception was PCM2, for which consistently no expression was detected (not shown). Importantly, mutation of potential cleavage sites 3 and 4 alone impacted S protein processing: the presence of the 90-kDa band was reduced in cells expressing PCM3, and a band with a molecular weight slightly higher than 90 kDa was observed upon expression of PCM4 (Figure 2B). Processing of PCM1 was comparable to that seen for MERS-S wild type. However, combined mutation of potential cleavage sites 1 and 3 (PCM1 + PCM3) abrogated S protein processing (Figure 2B), suggesting that also potential cleavage site 1 contributes to S protein cleavage in this experimental setting. Similar effects were seen when potential cleavage sites 3 and 4 were simultaneously altered (PCM3 + PCM4) or when all 3 potential cleavage sites were mutated in parallel (PCM1 + PCM3 + PCM4). Collectively, these results indicate that MERS-S cleavage is reduced or altered upon mutation of potential cleavage sites 1, 3, and 4.\n",

For this, we investigated whether S protein cleavage can be blocked by a cell-permeable tripeptide derivative containing an Arg-X-Arg motive, which is known to inhibit several proprotein convertases, including furin [31]. Treatment with this PCI reduced the production of the 90-kDa band in cells transfected to express MERS-S (Figure 3). Moreover, the presence of PCI diminished processing of the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) into GP1 and GP2 (Figure 3), which depends on the activity of the proprotein convertase furin [32]. In contrast, processing of the glycoprotein of Lassa virus (LASV-GPC), which is mediated by the proprotein convertase SKI-1/S1P [33], was not suppressed (Figure 3). This finding is in keeping with the known differences in substrate specificity (and thus inhibitor sensitivity) of SKI-I/SIP, compared with proprotein convertases with specificity for basic amino acids, like furin [34]. Collectively, these results show that the activity of proprotein convertases is essential for MERS-S processing in transfected cells.\n",

In contrast, infectivity of particles bearing LASV-GPC or EBOV-GP was not affected (Figure 4B), in keeping with the findings that processing of LASV-GPC is not inhibited by PCI (Figure 3) and that processing of EBOV-GP by proprotein convertases is dispensable for GP-driven virus-cell fusion [36, 37]. Of note, no inhibitory effect was detected when 293T cells transfected to express DPP4 were chosen as targets (Figure 4B), indicating that S protein processing in virus-producing cells might be dispensable for infectivity when target cells express robust amounts of DPP4. In sum, these results suggest that proprotein convertase activity is largely dispensable for MERS-S\u2013driven cell-cell and virus-cell fusion, at least when target cells produce high levels of DPP4.",

However, PCI treatment did not reduce MERS-CoV propagation, as determined by the amount of viral RNA (Figure 5B and data not shown) or infectious units (Figure 5B and data not shown) present in culture supernatants. Similarly, treatment of MERS-CoV\u2013infected cultures had little if any effect on the formation of cytopathic effects, as demonstrated by comparable destruction of the cell monolayer (Figure 5C).

However, TMPRSS2 might not be the only cellular protease that constitutes a potential therapeutic target in the context of coronavirus infection. Thus, cleavage of MERS-S during biogenesis in infected cells might be required for subsequent cleavage and activation of the S protein by TMPRSS2 during viral uptake into target cells. Such a scenario would not be unprecedented, given that entry mediated by the glycoproteins of certain bunyaviruses depends on glycoprotein processing during synthesis in the constitutive secretory pathway and, as suggested by a recent report, during viral uptake into target cells [42]. Alternatively, it is conceivable that processing of MERS-S in infected cells is dispensable for virus-cell but required for cell-cell fusion, which results in formation of syncytia, a feature of MERS-CoV pathogenesis [5].",

The finding that MERS-S is efficiently cleaved in transfected or MERS-CoV\u2013infected cells is in keeping with several studies examining MERS-S expression for other purposes [16, 43, 44]. One report showed that MERS-S is not cleaved in transfected cells [17]; however, a MERS-S variant with a truncated cytoplasmic tail was examined, and it is conceivable that this deletion interfered with S protein exposure to or recognition by proprotein convertases. Alternatively, the cells used for S protein expression might have produced only low amounts of proprotein convertases. Robust S protein processing by proprotein convertases has also been reported for mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 [45, 46] and IBV [18, 47], while cleavage of SARS-S by these proteases is inefficient [48\u201350]. Thus, MERS-S belongs to the subgroup of coronavirus S proteins that are substrates of proprotein convertases, and MERS-S processing in different cellular systems, including the colon-derived cell line Caco-2, is robust.",

The finding that RXXR motifs located at the predicted border between S1 and S2 subunit are important for MERS-S processing by proprotein convertases might therefore not be unexpected. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that at least 2 RXXR motifs had to be mutated in parallel to markedly reduce S protein processing. This suggests that the processing enzyme(s) can recognize >1 cleavage site. Indeed, the S2 fragment produced upon cleavage of PCM4 showed a slightly increased molecular weight relative to the fragment generated from MERS-S wild type, which would be in keeping with use of an upstream cleavage site, most likely potential cleavage site 3. Alternatively, the integrity of the RXXR motifs located at the border of the S1 and S2 subunit might be required to present a single cleavage site in a protease sensitive configuration.",

            "text": "Interference with ebolavirus glycoprotein processing by proprotein convertases is compatible with robust viral spread in vitro and in vivo [36, 37]. In contrast, proprotein convertase activity is required for full activity of certain MHV and IBV S proteins in cell-cell and virus-cell fusion reactions [18, 45\u201347]. Moreover, processing of the HIV envelope protein by proprotein convertases is essential for viral infectivity, and it has been suggested that processing of SARS-S, although being inefficient, is still required for full viral spread and for the establishment of cytopathic effects in infected cultures [48]. The present study provides evidence that efficient blockade of MERS-S processing by PCI has no appreciable effects on S protein activity in cell-cell fusion assay and does not modulate MERS-CoV spread in susceptible cells. In contrast, inhibition of MERS-S processing markedly reduced MERS-S\u2013driven fusion of virions with 293 T cells expressing low amounts of endogenous DPP4. It is therefore conceivable that processing of MERS-S by proprotein convertases is required for optimal spread of MERS-CoV in target cells expressing low levels of DPP4. Such a scenario would be in keeping with the observation that inefficient SARS-S\u2013driven cell-cell fusion due to limited receptor expression can be rescued by directed expression of S protein\u2013activating proteases and vice versa [50].",
