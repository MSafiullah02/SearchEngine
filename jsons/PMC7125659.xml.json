Despite a clear reduction in TB incidence between 2010 and 2011, post-TB pulmonary sequelae remain under-recognized in most countries. The direct link between the number of TB episodes and lung damage is well documented [2]. In addition, widespread lung destruction may occur in spite of effective anti-tuberculous therapy. Subsequent healing may result in extensive fibrosis, bronchostenosis, pleura remodeling with loss of pulmonary volume and traction bronchiectasis [3]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Cambodia was the country with the highest documented TB prevalence worldwide at 817/100 000 population in 2012 [1]. Other under-treated bacterial infections such as pulmonary abscesses or purulent pleurisies may also cause pulmonary and/or pleural sequelae. Finally, bronchiectasis may result from acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) with both tuberculous and severe non-tuberculous pathogens, which are highly prevalent in Cambodian children [4].",

Chronic pulmonary disease was often very advanced and associated with Gram-negative bacilli and S. pneumoniae.

Our results are consistent with other studies conducted in Thailand and in China, where P. aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenza were also the two most frequent pathogens in patients with steady-state bronchiectasis [19], [20]. Pseudomonas colonization of bronchiectasis is associated with forced expired volume decline [20], increased courses of oral antibiotics, increased hospital admissions [21], and subsequent alteration of the quality of life [22].

A short prevalence assessment from the same prospective study performed in 2010 among 138 consecutive patients showed that 21 (15%) were infected with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (i.e Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, M. scrofulaceum, M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, Mycobacterium spp.) in at least one of three consecutive sputum samples (Institut Pasteur in Cambodia unpublished data). Of these 21 patients, nine presented with ALRIPS. It has been shown that patients with bronchiectasis and post-TB sequelae have a higher risk than other chronic respiratory diseases to develop non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis [24]. Nevertheless, the pathogenicity of atypical mycobacteria is difficult to establish in this study and environmental contaminations cannot be excluded [25]. Clinicians, however, have to be aware of such diseases that could overestimate the TB burden. Developing mycobacteria culture and identification throughout the country could help to address this issue.",

However, 42% of isolated H. influenzae and all P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to this antibiotic. Cambodian antibiotics guidelines for ALRI are currently under revision and will be adjusted to the local epidemiology. In theory, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, or fluoroquinolones are possible choices for first line therapy. There are, however, two major obstacles to the broad use of fluoroquinolones as first-line empirical treatment in Cambodia. On one hand, ofloxacine and ciprofloxacine are not effective as anti-pneumococcal drugs and 13% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to ciprofloxacine in our study. On the other hand, fluoroquinolones currently remain active in TB. [26]. Generalization of fluoroquinolones use could therefore delay TB diagnosis, and trigger widespread emergence of resistant TB strains [27]. Since the presentation of the ALRIPS patients was less severe on admission, fluoroquinolones could be proposed in this group only as a second-line therapy if the first-line treatment is found to be ineffective upon re-evaluation and after the results of AFB screening.",

However, chest radiographs have limited sensitivity to detect mild abnormalities, and especially bronchiectasis. Some cases with mild bronchiectasis could have been classified in ALRIHL group. In a Thai study on bronchiectasis, 10% of the patients with bronchiectasis detected by computed tomography (CT) scan had a normal chest radiograph [19]. CT scan would have been a better diagnosis tool than chest radiograph in this case, but unfortunately it is not available in Cambodian provincial hospitals.",
