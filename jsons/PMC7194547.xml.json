A central focus of this research area is on the dynamics of regional development and the roles of local actors, policy settings and market forces in development pathways (Plummer et al., 2018). Much of this research has been focused on the resources sector and particularly mining and energy extraction and how host communities can retain benefits locally (Halseth et al., 2014; Tonts et al., 2012). At the heart of this research is the extent to which host regions are affected (positively and negatively) from extracting resources. This includes, for example, changes to the structure of the economy, employment, income distribution, gender balance, demographic profile, infrastructure and services (Argent 2013; Measham et al., 2016; Fleming et al., 2015; Ryser et al., 2019).",

These inquiries have brought together diverse sets of stakeholders, putting forward multiple and often contrasting perspectives on appropriate mechanisms for benefit retention. Some of these include \u2018corporate social responsibility\u2019 initiatives such as local supply chain procedures (Esteves and Barclay 2011) and local labour hire requirements (Jones et al., 2007). Others have recommended benefit-sharing schemes such as the state-operated \u2018royalties for regions\u2019 program aimed at redistributing public revenues to regional communities (Argent 2013; Plummer et al., 2018; van Staden and Haslam McKenzie, 2019), either in addition to or separate from corporate social responsibility initiatives. The effectiveness of these mechanisms will vary between contexts, depending to a large extent on what else is going on in the regional economy.",

Moreover, the magnitude of the backward and forward linkages depends on the capacity of the local economy to supply the inputs required by the mining industry or to use the outputs of the industry in a feasible and desirable way (Fleming and Measham 2014). Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to assess the desirability, likelihood and potential economic benefits of using a locally extracted resource (natural gas) within the region.",

            "text": "When seeking to conceptualise the driving forces influencing the sustainability of regional communities in large, resource-rich countries with relatively low populations such as Australia and Canada, several authors have found evolutionary economic geography to be a useful concept (Plummer et al., 2018; Tonts et al., 2014). This approach emphasises the importance of history and spatial relationships in understanding the development of regional economies and their trajectories for future development. This concept follows a resurgence of interest in ideas from evolutionary and institutional economics which stress the importance of path dependency and the role of institutions in shaping economic development trajectories rather than simply market forces (MacKinnon et al., 2002; 2009; Nelson and Winter 2002). Evolutionary economic geography highlights core-periphery dynamics. At the national scale, resource-rich peripheries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada have evolved historically along a path of supplying food, fibre and minerals, to distant economic cores such as England and more recently Japan and China (Tonts et al., 2012; Hayter, 2008). On this basis, evolutionary economic geography has been described as a lens through which to view and understand change within economies. Social, political and economic arrangements become embedded around spatially and temporally-bound economies. These can include distinct supply chains, infrastructure investments, labour forces and technologies (Halseth et al., 2014).",

The model of regional economic resilience used in this paper has four components (Martin 2012). The first is resistance, representing the degree of sensitivity of a region to economic downturn. The second is recovery, referring to the speed at which a regional economy can bounce back from a downturn. The third is re-orientation, encompassing the extent to which a regional economy can adapt to new circumstances, and the fourth is renewal which refers to the extent to which a regional economy can resume to grow (Martin 2012.)",

Lock-in isn't necessarily good or bad, but within the context of regional development, path dependence reflects the notion that processes are locally contingent and that initial events can have long term effects through positive feedback responses at the regional scale. Once established, these processes tend to \u2018lock\u2019 a region into a particular development trajectory. Once \u2018lock-in\u2019 is established a strong change in policy settings is required to shift the development path of a region (Tonts et al., 2012). Some authors have argued that the focus on \u2018lock-in\u2019 is at odds with the notion of evolution, because it implies a stable state (Martin 2010). At its heart evolution implies change over time, influenced by historical circumstances and new opportunities due to changes in demand and technology. Therefore \u2018lock-in\u2019 is not absolute in a static sense (Martin, 2010). For this reason, we see in Australia, that regions that have been shaped by similar forces can have quite different outcomes (Tonts et al., 2014; Plummer and Tonts, 2013).",

In particular, to what extent do regional development policies promote sustainable rural economies in the context of broader market trends? Are these interventions contributing to the sustainability of rural areas or rather providing a band-aid approach with limited effectiveness against broader structural forces that fundamentally constrain the economic resilience of rural regions (Plummer et al., 2018). In general, regional economists have emphasised the need to understand the extent to which institutional change is required to develop new growth paths in regions (Boschma, 2015). However, in settler societies such as Australia and Canada, geographers argue that attention to even basic infrastructure needs may be required before new economic strategies can be pursued due to decades of missed investments through neoliberal policies (Tonts et al., 2014; Ryser et al., 2019).",

Since 2018, Australia overtook Qatar as the largest exporter of natural gas (Jaganathan, 2018). As Australian gas exports have soared, domestic wholesale gas prices have risen from around $4 per gigajoule in 2012 to around $10 per gigajoule in 2018. Strong demand for gas exports has raised concerns over potential gas shortages for domestic markets (Grafton et al., 2018; Longbottom, 2019). Increasing domestic gas prices have put pressure on other parts of the economy and the manufacturing sector, which requires a reliable and affordable energy supply. In resilience terms, manufacturing businesses have been close to a threshold of collapse and in some cases have passed it. In the context of meeting global gas export market demands, arguments have been put forward to protect domestic manufacturing from disruptions in gas supply and to keep prices affordable for manufacturing industries in the national interest (Stanford, 2016).",

The region comprises local government areas of Grant, Mount Gambier, Wattle Range, Robe, Naracoorte and Lucindale, Kingston and Tatiara. The largest town in the region is Mount Gambier, recognised for its famous groundwater-fed Blue Lake, which attracts tourists for its impressive colour and supplies drinking water for the town (Alexander et al., 2010). Another important town is Penola surrounded by Coonawarra vineyards. This town is where Mary MacKillop founded a Catholic school and established a religious congregation resulting in her being recognised as a Saint by the Catholic Church. The economy of the region is diverse, including a range of agricultural industries including cereal crops, grape growing, livestock grazing (beef and sheep) and dairy farming. Forestry also plays a substantial role in the form of pine plantations. Manufacturing in the form of food processing and packaged food production is a substantial part of the regional economy. A wide range of household food items are produced in the region on the site of the former Kraft factory, subsequently operated by global food company \u2018Mondelez\u2019. Philadelphia cream cheese from this factory is distributed throughout Asia and the Middle East from the factory in Mount Gambier. A milk processing factory exports powdered milk directly to China. In addition, the region hosts the only remaining Australian factory operated by Kimberly-Clark, supplying paper and fibre products to domestic and international markets.",

Part of the geological basin stretches under the Limestone Coast region in the South East of South Australia. The first commercial conventional gas discovery was made at Katnook in 1987, South of Penola, followed by the discovery of the Ladbroke Grove field in 1989. As a result of these discoveries, the southern part of the Limestone Coast had an active onshore gas industry during the 1990s and the 2000s. Demand for gas from Kimberly-Clark played an important role in developing the South East Pipeline System (SEPS) to connect to the local paper mill and supply the energy needs of this facility. Initially, the gas plant and the associated pipeline infrastructure was a completely closed system operating separately from any other pipeline in the country. Gas supplied locally was used by local businesses including timber milling, pulp and paper milling, commercial food preparation, for gas-fired power generation and for domestic use in the Limestone Coast region. Industry activity diminished in 2010 with the official closure of the local Katnook Gas Plant in 2013. The local pipeline was subsequently connected to interstate pipeline infrastructure, which has supplied local gas users since the closure of the Katnook plant (Fig. 1\n).",

The initial set of background materials comprised around 20 charts and tables and was deemed too detailed for use in communicating with stakeholders.

Consumers of outputs can be the producing industry itself, other industries or final consumers. Following this principle, the RISE model is used to estimate effects of different levels of intermediate and final demand by 2030 on two key indicators of regional economic performance: GRP and full-time equivalent employment (FTE). Intermediate demand is the total of all inputs, from all industries, that go into the production of an industry's products. Final demand is the sum of regional household and government consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, changes in inventories, tourism expenditure and exports. The GRP indicates the total value of outputs minus the cost of production inputs per industry (i.e. the added value). This information can be used to measure the net industry contribution to the performance of a regional economy. Changes in the size and distribution of the regional workforce across economic activities were assessed through changes in FTEs.",

Annual data for these variables were converted to compositional time series data by dividing each industry value by the total value for all industries in the study region. Afterwards, a log-ratio transformation was applied using Other services as a normalising industry (any industry can be used to generate ratios without changing the results). The resulting log-ratio time series were analysed through exponential smoothing state space (ETS) models (Hyndman, Koehler, Ord, and Snyder, 2008). Fitted ETS models were used to project trends and 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) for the selected regional economic indicators from 2018 to 2030, which informed the parameterisation of industry changes in the RISE model.

Other industries follow the upper boundary line of the 95% confidence interval trend projections. As scenario 2 Gas and General Industrial Expansion describes a case where growth in the Limestone Coast Region of economic activity occurs across all industries, for the model input this is interpreted as an evolution of the local industries along with the upper boundary trend. Scenario 3, Gas Supply Chain Expansion, projects a continued growth of the gas industry and industries that were previously heavy users of gas. Growth is also expected in industries that could benefit from capital investment for infrastructure development, that is the local construction industries and exploration and other mining support services. This latter industry, for exploration and mining services contributed almost 20% of its output in 2015\u201316 to the oil and gas extraction industry, which represents 5% out of the total industrial input into that industry for 2015\u201316. Thus, the parametrisation of this scenario uses the upper boundary trend for the gas industry and industrial gas users, while the input data for other industries follow the average trend.

In other words, the model incorporates price sensitivity, which accounts for the possibility of non-linear production (EconSearch, 2017; West and Jackson, 2005). This means that an industry may be able to increase output in the short term without increasing wages and employment. The outcome of price adjusted models is more conservative in the projections of flow-on effects on GRP and employment. Given the underlying RISE model IO data is for the financial year of 2015\u201316, to carry out the forecast for the 10 year period from 2021 to 2030, the change modelled in the first year was an average of the dollar value changes in the GRP for the six-year period between 2016 and 2020.",

If the growing economic relevance of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing businesses continues at observed trends, by 2030 around 40% of the regional added value would be generated by this industry (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, the contribution of the Health Care and Social Assistance Services industry has gradually increased from 2000 to 2017 \u2013 possibly due to an increasing demand for services for an ageing population (Fig. 3C).

The quantitative modelling strongly aligned to the principles of forward and backward linkages and their role in regional development outcomes (Watkins 1963, 1977; Gunton, 2003). Specifically, the modelling clearly demonstrated that the preferred scenario, where gas development fuels a diverse regional economy, would indeed lead to the greatest increases in jobs and regional economic growth.

Unlike the development experience of export-oriented mining towns such as Roxby Downs in South Australia, Port Hedland in Western Australia or the towns scattered across the Surat Basin in Queensland, Mount Gambier and the surrounding Limestone Coast region are considering very different options. The policy incentives provided by the South Australian Government through the PACE Program which are intended to tie the extraction of the gas to local users supports an important alternative path compared to those regions locked into overseas supply chains. The potential for an alternative narrative is partly due to previous investments in local infrastructure during the 1990s before the gas industry wound down from 2010. With renewed potential for gas to play in important role in the regional development, this aging infrastructure needs to be updated and expanded to fully realise local benefits. State Government policies have gone a long way towards re-opening the gas industry and encouraging local distribution, however the assumption is that infrastructure upgrades will be provided by the private sector. The lessons from other contexts show that infrastructure investment to underpin regional development has experienced a degree of market failure, with some regions struggling even to supply basic infrastructure (Tonts et al., 2014; Ryser et al., 2019), leave alone regional pipeline networks to support gas users such as food and fibre processing facilities.",

In the case of the Limestone Coast, the economy is continuing to grow, however stakeholders were concerned about the degree of resistance to future downturns. Following the stakeholder workshop conducted as part of this research, regional stakeholders looked for ways to build resistance and to encourage re-orientation and how the gas industry can increase resilience in these key dimensions. In particular, stakeholders conducted a regional infrastructure audit which highlighted the role of increasing gas distribution networks as emphasised in the stakeholder workshop (RDA Limestone Coast 2019). In so doing, they sought to reduce path dependence for the region (Boschma and Frenken 2006; Tonts et al., 2012).",

The former Kraft factory currently owned by Mondelez with headquarters in Illinois USA, manufactures an astounding range of products found on supermarket shelves in many countries. All of these linkages are vulnerable to multiple influences affecting international supply chains including foreign exchange rates and more recently global disease pandemics such as the Coronavirus COVID-19 (Manolo et al., 2015; Oxford Analytica 2020).

The potential to use resources within the region through value-adding industries remains an elusive goal for many countries, including Australia and Canada. The research presented in this paper suggests that using locally extracted gas is plausible scenario for the Limestone Coast region of Australia. Moreover, modelling results show that the scenario in which gas is used locally, and thereby providing an additional energy source to local manufacturing industries, would provide more benefits in the form of jobs and economic growth compared with scenarios where gas would develop in isolation of those industries. To increase gas supply to local markets, new infrastructure would need to be developed. State Government policies have already gone a long way towards re-opening the gas industry, and regional stakeholders aspire to seeing policy settings extended to support gas distribution infrastructure to increase the use of gas locally in order to fuel growth in other sectors of the regional economy.",
