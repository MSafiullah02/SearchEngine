            "text": "ABSTRACT: There is growing evidence that requirements for particular AA increase when pigs are kept under low sanitary conditions. The extent to which reduction in growth performance is related to these increased requirements is unclear. To evaluate this relationship, an experiment (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement) was performed with 612 male pigs (9 per pen) kept under low sanitary conditions (LSC) or high sanitary conditions (HSC) and offered ad libitum access to either a normal CP concentration diet (NP; 17, 15, and 15% CP for the starter, grower, and finisher phase, respectively) or a low CP concentration diet (LP; 20% CP reduced relative to NP for each phase), each of which containing a basal AA profile (AA-B) or a supplemented AA profile (AA-S). The supplemented diet type contained 20% more Met, Thr, and Trp relative to Lys on an apparent ileal digestible basis compared with the basal diet type. Pigs were followed for a complete fattening period and slaughtered at a targeted pen weight of 110 kg. Haptoglobin concentrations in serum (0.92 g/L for LSC and 0.78 g/L for HSC) and IgG antibody titers against keyhole limpet hemocyanin (3.53 for LSC and 3.08 for HSC) collected in the starter, grower, and finisher phases and pleuritis scores at slaughter (0.51 for LSC and 0.20 for HSC) were greater for LSC pigs compared with HSC pigs (P \u2264 0.01), illustrating that sanitary conditions affected health conditions. The ADG and G:F were greater for HSC pigs compared with LSC pigs (P \u2264 0.01). The number of white blood cells (WBC) was higher in (AA-S)-fed pigs compared with (AA-B)-fed pigs when kept at LSC but not at HSC [SS (sanitary conditions) \u00d7 AA interaction, P = 0.04]. Pigs fed NP had a lower number of WBC compared with pigs fed LP (P = 0.02). The number of platelets in pigs fed AA-S diets was higher compared with pigs fed AA-B diets (P \u2264 0.01). A 20% reduction in dietary supplementation of Met, Thr, and Trp relative to Lys decreased G:F more in LSC pigs than in HSC pigs (interaction, P = 0.03), illustrating that dietary requirements for these AA differ depending on sanitary conditions. This study, performed under practical conditions, shows that AA requirements are dependent on sanitary conditions. Furthermore, supplementation of diets with particular AA may improve performance, especially under poor hygienic conditions. Dietary protein concentration as well as Met, Thr, and Trp supplementation can modify immune status, which may influence resistance to subclinical and clinical diseases. trients, such as AA. If the enhanced requirements are not compensated for by greater intake, repartitioning of dietary protein or AA away from development and growth tissues occurs (Le Floc'h et al., 2009) toward use by the immune processes. This shift of nutrients, together with an often-observed reduction in feed intake in case of immune stimulation, reduces pig performance (Klasing and Johnstone, 1991; Pastorelli et al., 2012a) .",

            "text": "Despite the growing evidence that particular AA requirements are dependent on immune system activation, it remains unclear to what extent reduced performance during (subclinical) infections is related to changes in AA requirements and whether dietary supplementation of these AA can reverse the performance loss. Moreover, most evidence for increased AA requirements is obtained in studies in which pigs were repeatedly challenged with lipopolysaccharide (lPS; e.g., Kim et al., 2012; de Ridder et al., 2012; Rakhshandeh et al., 2010) or Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Kampman-van de Hoek et al., 2015; Le Floc'h et al., 2008) , and it can be questioned to what extent these results can be extrapolated to pigs in commercial conditions (Pastorelli et al., 2012b) . Therefore, we studied, under practical conditions, if the performance and immune status of pigs kept under different sanitary conditions is influenced by protein intake and AA supplementation. We hypothesized that increased provision of Met, Thr, and Trp would increase performance of pigs, particularly when kept under low sanitary conditions and low dietary protein intake.",

All values were expressed in the same units for a pig of 50 kg BW with an assumed protein deposition of 138 g/d. The Met + Cys (45% of AID Lys) and Trp (15% of AID Lys) concentrations in AA-B diets, obtained in this manner, were adjusted to 51% Met + Cys and 18% Trp based on results from Knowles et al.

The supplemented AA profile (AA-S) was derived from the AA-B profile by increasing the Met, Thr, and Trp ratio relative to Lys by 20%. These AA were increased in particular as they are believed to be important as building blocks for proteins, for example, acute-phase proteins, synthesized in case of immune system activation Le Floc'h et al., 2008 , 2012 Rakhshandeh et al., 2010) , because of their function as precursors for important immune related components and antioxidants, and also because of their effects on several immune processes. Methionine is known to be an important methyl donor (Burke et al., 1951) and antioxidant (Wu, 2009) , Thr plays an important role in mucus synthesis for gut integrity and immune function (Wu, 2009) , and Trp is known as a precursor of melatonin and serotonin, both known to inhibit inflammatory cytokines (Wu, 2009) .",

            "text": "The KLH antigen is a relevant antigen to measure Nab levels as pigs had no previous exposure to KLH. Natural antibodies are defined as antigen-specific antibodies that are present in the absence of intentional immunization with specific antigens (KLH, in this case; Star et al., 2007) . The IgG titer against KLH was greater for LSC pigs than for HSC pigs. Because Nab play a role in the first line of defense against pathogens, the increase in Nab levels might be an adaptive response of the pigs to the higher infection pressure at LSC. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific antibodies were shown to be cross-reactive with antigens of pathogens (Hamilton et al., 1999) . Therefore, it can not be excluded that antigenspecific Nab are products of adaptive immune responses and cross-reactive with structurally related antigens. Specific memory B cells were shown to be activated in a polyclonal but antigen-independent way (Lanzavecchia et al., 2006) . This way of activation is triggered by nonspecific microbial-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide or bacterial or viral nucleotide motifs. This B cell activation mechanism is likely responsible for the lifelong presence of circulating specific antibodies, which forms an important part of the first line of defense. It can easily be envisaged that memory B cells of pigs under LSC become more activated by microbial associated molecular patterns than under HSC, resulting in higher levels of KLH-specific IgG levels. For IgM titers against KLH, there were no differences between LSC and HSC pigs. In the study of Ploegaert et al. (2010) , a similar result in IgM and IgG Nab was found. Ploegaert et al. (2010) studied genetic and phenotypic correlation of Nab titers in dairy cattle and found greater estimates for environmental variation in the IgG than in the IgM isotype of Nab. Most probably, the LSC in the present study, as an environmental factor, stimulated KLH-specific IgG responses. Immunoglobulin M titers are believed to be influenced by genetic factors (Ploegaert et al., 2010) , which explains the absence of differences in IgM against KLH between sanitary regimes.",

In general, it is perceived that use by the immune system has a high priority (Humphrey and Klasing, 2004; Le Floc'h et al., 2004) . From a metaanalysis, Pastorelli et al. (2012b) concluded that the major portion of the reduction in ADG (12.2% lower ADG of the total 16.3% lower ADG in pigs in poor housing conditions compared with unchallenged animals) was related to a decreased feed efficiency (in Pastorelli et al. [2012b] , indicated as \"maintenance\") rather than to a decrease in feed intake. This was also observed in the present experiment, where G:F was affected but ADFI was not influenced by sanitary conditions.

Differences in ATTD for N correspond with results by Kampman-van de Hoek et al. (2016), who found a reduction in ATTD for N of 3.7% in LSC growing pigs compared with HSC pigs (P \u2264 0.01). The reduced ATTD for N might be due to intestinal infections, intestinal damage, or an increased digesta passage rate (Sandberg et al., 2006; Pastorelli et al., 2012b ).

It should be noted, however, that this effect was not yet present in the starter phase. Our results are in accordance with other studies that show that immune stimulation by different challenges lead to increased requirements for specific AA compared with unchallenged pigs (Grimble and Grimble, 1998; Le Floc'h et al., 2004; Klasing, 2007; Rakhshandeh et al., 2014) . As a consequence, these animals require more AA for their immune system. The increased demand for these AA (Met, Thr, and Trp) for LSC pigs was expected to be greater for pigs fed the LP. This interaction, however, was absent. Therefore, the results of our study do not confirm our hypothesis that at low levels of protein intake, the requirements for Thr, Trp, and Met relative to Lys are increased. As illustrated by the meta-analysis by Pastorelli et al. (2012b) , the type of challenge has a major impact on the response of pigs. The contrast in sanitary conditions, as applied in our study, illustrates that also in absence of clinical disease, requirements for Met, Thr, and Trp are persistently affected over the entire weight range. This is in agreement with observations by Kim et al. (2012) for Met, using a repeated LPS model, but not in a study by de Ridder et al.

High sanitary condition AA-S pigs had greater ADFI compared with HSC AA-B pigs, whereas pigs in LSC ate the same amount, regardless of AA supplementation. The greater ADFI for HSC AA-S pigs resulted in a tendency for ADG in the same direction as the change in ADFI. This result illustrates that pigs in HSC were probably more limited in their growth by the AA-B profile than LSC pigs receiving the same profile, which was expected to be the other way around due to the effect of immune stimulation of pigs housed in LSC. We speculate that 1 of the 3 supplemented AA, probably Met, has restricted growth, particularly inhibiting HSC pigs to exploit their full ADG potential following a period of restricted growth before the start of the trial. Methionine is thought to be the limiting AA because the Met:Lys ratio deviates most from recommended values (e.g., CVB, 2011) compared with Thr and Trp. The growth restriction in HSC pigs before the start of the trial was possibly caused by the vaccination strategy and illustrated by a lower BW of HSC pigs at the onset of the trial. The AA profile of the basal diets may not have been sufficient to support compensatory growth following a period of growth restriction.",

This may reflect a sensitive response of acute-phase proteins to protein scarcity (Houdijk et al., 2007) or a high priority for the use of AA for protein gain in young pigs, occurring at the expense of the synthesis of haptoglobin. It is unexpected that this interaction was not observed for WBC counts, which were consistently higher for LP pigs compared with NP pigs (P = 0.02), being unaffected by SC. Possible differences in migration of WBC into the lymphatic system or tissues complicates clear conclusions on this point (Ganusov and Auerbach., 2014; Marelli-Berg et al., 2010) .",

Although increasing the dietary protein concentration reduced monocyte counts, supplementation of Met, Thr, and Trp increased monocyte counts, regardless of SC. Elevated levels of Trp in the AA-S-fed pigs might have stimulated production of monocytes, as Trp is known to play a role in functionality of monocytes and lymphocytes . The administration of 300 mg Trp to rats increased monocyte phagocytosis and the innate immune response (Esteban et al., 2004) . Overall, there was no clear interaction for sanitary conditions and AA profile present on the measured blood parameters.",

Low sanitary conditions increased pleuritis scores at slaughter and increased indicators for the innate immune response and serum haptoglobin concentrations. The vaccination strategy for the HSC pigs in early life may have triggered a compensatory performance response (particularly ADFI) during the starter phase. Dietary supplementation of Met, Thr, and Trp improved the G:F, particularly under LSC, illustrating that dietary requirements for these AA are affected by sanitary conditions. Furthermore, this study provides indications that dietary protein concentration and Met, Thr, and Trp supplementation modify immune status.",
