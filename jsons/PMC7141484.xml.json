Although telemonitoring cannot solve every problem, it is well suited to the context of Covid-19, and organisations that have already invested in telemedicine are well positioned to expand them and ensure that patients with Covid-19 receive the appropriate care. This decision tree allows not only a collection of data but also a secured organisational process for patient orientation and an optimal physician medical time. Our experience could help other cancer centres, or even healthcare organisations, to implement a rapid effective programme with healthcare professionals monitoring patients at distance while being less exposed. Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute should provide for free the Capri Covid app worldwide to help Covid-infected patients with cancer.",
