            "text": "Three major structurally distinct classes of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are recognized as the lycorane, galanthamine or crinane types (Jin, 2005), while several other less common structural variants are also known (Kornienko and Evidente, 2008). These structural types are related as a consequence of their common biogenesis from the amino acid-derived precursor norbelladine 1 (Scheme 1\n). Representatives from each of the major series include lycorine 2, galanthamine 3 and crinamine 4, respectively, illustrating the remarkable structural diversity that Nature has evolved from 1. The plethora of biological properties exhibited by these compounds is not surprisingly as equally diverse (Bastida et al., 2006). Of the galanthamine class, galanthamine 3 itself is the first of the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids to be approved as a pharmaceutical in the treatment of a human disease. Its remarkable ability to reversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase, of relevance in Alzheimer\u2019s and other neuro-degenerative diseases, has very recently led to its approval as a prescription drug under the generic name Reminyl (Houghton et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Alkaloids of the crinane series have been shown to exhibit a range of biological activities (Tram et al., 2002). For example, crinamine 4 is known to be cytotoxic to the malarial parasite and to a series of tumor cell lines (Likhitwitayawuid et al., 1993), while the activity of 6-hydroxycrinamine against mouse melanoma cells has been documented (Nair et al., 1998) and haemanthamine (the C-3 epimer of crinamine) is known to inhibit protein synthesis and have anti-proliferative action (Jimenez et al., 1976, Hohmann et al., 2002). We recently demonstrated the potent apoptosis-inducing ability of the \u03b1-ethano bridged crinane alkaloids crinamine 4 and the C-3 epimeric haemanthamine. These compounds were shown to be significantly more active than the \u03b2-ethano bridged compounds (McNulty et al., 2007a, McNulty et al., 2009) demonstrating the critical structural requirements in the vicinity of the C-ring. In the lycorane series, pancratistatin 5, and its analogues such as narciclasine (Kornienko and Evidente, 2008), are known for their potent and selective anticancer properties as well as their synthetically challenging structures. Synthetic efforts in this area involving a complementary pair approach and pharmacophore minimization (McNulty and Mo, 1998, McNulty et al., 2001, McNulty et al., 2005, McNulty et al., 2007b, McNulty et al., 2008, Rinner and Hudlicky, 2005) disclosed the strict requirements of the free hydroxyl groups in ring-C of the compounds for potent apoptosis-inducing activity. We have shown that pancratistatin induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells with minimal effect on normal cells and that mitochondria are the site of action (McLachlan et al., 2005). Evidence for the apoptotic mode of death in cancer cells was related to early activation of caspase-3 followed by flipping of phosphatidyl serine (Kekre et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The interesting structural requirements for apoptosis-inducing activity in the pancratistatin-type of lycorane derivative drew our attention to alkaloids of the lycorine subclass. Lycorine 2 is by far the most common alkaloid within the Amaryllidaceae family. This compound exhibits a vast array of biological properties. It is active against poliovirus (Hwang et al., 2008), vaccinia smallpox virus (Deng et al., 2007) and SARS-associated coronavirus (Li and Tan, 2005). Furthermore, it exhibits antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Del Giudice et al., 2005), is fatal to the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (Mackey et al., 2006) and is more potent than indomethacin as an anti-inflammatory agent (Citoglu et al., 1998). In addition, lycorine 2 has been shown to have insect antifeedant activity (Evidente et al., 1986), inhibit ascorbic acid biosynthesis (Arrigoni et al., 1975) and inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase of significance in motor neuron disease (Lopez et al., 2002). The fact that it has an inhibitory effect towards cell division and cell elongation in plants suggests that it may inhibit either (or both) RNA and protein synthesis (De Leo et al., 1973, Jimenez et al., 1976). As a potential chemotherapeutic, it has shown most promise as an antiproliferative agent of a number of cancer cell lines (Likhitwitayawuid et al., 1993). Investigation into the in vitro mode of action in a leukemia (HL-60) cell line model established that lycorine 2 suppressed tumor cell growth and reduced cell survival via cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis (Liu et al., 2004). Further investigation of the effect of lycorine 2 on severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice inoculated with HL-60 cells showed that it decreased tumor cell growth and increased survival rates with no observable adverse effects on treated animals (Liu et al., 2007). Arrest of cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction was also the demonstrated mechanism of action of lycorine 2 on multiple myeloma (KM3) cells (Li et al., 2007).",

The reaction of lycorine 2 with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and pyridine in dichloromethane (DCM) (Scheme 2) was therefore investigated. To our delight, this reaction afforded the novel monosilyl ether 7 (in 82% yield), most likely due to the greater reactivity of the allylic pseudoequatorial 2-hydroxy group over the axially-orientated C-1 hydroxyl. The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 (see Section 3) had the H-2 signal at \u03b4 4.29 (dd), upfield-shifted from \u03b4 5.37 (dd) where it resonates for lycorine (2) while COSY contours were established between H-2 and both H-1 (\u03b4 4.43, dd) and H-3 (\u03b4 5.42, dd).

Fig. 1\ndepicts the apoptotic index of Jurkat cells treated for 72 h with 1, 5 and 10 \u03bcM final concentration of alkaloids 2,6 and 7\u201310 respectively. The control cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) so the final concentrations in the culture media was 0.1, 0.5 and 1%, respectively, to match the volume of vehicle added to treated cells. Generally, mammalian cells tolerate 0.1\u20130.5% DMSO, but 1% DMSO can show toxicity over 72 h. It is not surprising then, that the 10 \u03bcM (10 \u03bcL/ml of 1 mm stock solution of compounds) equivalent of vehicle control (1% DMSO) caused an increase in apoptotic cells. The index for lycorine 2 and pseudolycorine 6 is striking with over 85% of cells appearing apoptotic after 72 h treatment at 10 \u03bcM. Interestingly, 1-acetyllycorine 9 was apoptotic up to \u223c45% at 10 \u03bcM while the other analogues (7,8,10) exhibited indices at control levels. Nuclear morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis were visualized by Hoechst staining (Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n), by which condensed nuclei of cells affected by the treatment are more fluorescent and fragmented in appearance. In parallel with Hoechst staining, cells were also treated with Trypan Blue, to evaluate the extent of necrotic cells, and subjected to Annexin-V binding assays as a further indication of the induction of programmed cell death (data not shown). The mild activity (\u223c45%) exhibited by 1-acetyllycorine 9 indicates that a small substituent at C-1 is partly tolerated. Overall, it is clear from these results that a free ring-C 1,2-diol is required in the lycorine series (lycorine and pseudolycorine) for potent apoptosis-inducing activity since both the monosubstituted silyl ether 7 as well as disubstituted analogues (8 and 10) were all inactive.",

The presence of a C-1,C-10b double bond in the pancratistatin series, such as narciclasine, is known to have no detrimental effect on its anticancer activity profile (Rinner and Hudlicky, 2005). We have also demonstrated the mildly modulating influence of the C-1,C-2 double bond in the \u03b1-crinane compounds (McNulty et al., 2007a, McNulty et al., 2009). The introduction of a sp\n2 hybridized carbon at the ring junction appears to introduce only a minor conformational effect on the pharmacophore. The C-3, C-4 double bond in lycorine 2 may play a similar conformational role to that in the crinane and pancratistatin series since dihydrolycorine derivatives have also been shown to possess activity (Jimenez et al., 1976).",

However the 1,2-dihydroxy groups present in lycorines 2 and 6, which we now show to be required for activity, have the opposite absolute configuration to analogous positions as found in pancratistatin. Furthermore, the C-4a and C-10b ring junction in lycorines 2 and 6 is also opposite in configuration to that found in pancratistatin. Given the strict requirements of the ring-C hydroxyl groups that are known for activity in the pancratistatin series, it is remarkable to note that ent-pancratistatin derivatives have also been shown to have only slightly reduced anticancer activity (Hudlicky et al., 2002). While removing a single hydroxyl group may result in inactive compounds, changing the absolute configuration of the entire molecule can result in retention of activity. These results demonstrate the importance and high sensitivity of the ring-C region in modulating cytotoxicity and heightens the possibility that all of these compounds (pancratistatin, ent-pancratistatin, narciclasine and now also the lycorines), may act upon the same biological receptor.",

Comparisons are drawn between this activity and that demonstrated by the pancratistatin/ent-pancratistatin structural types that may indicate a common pharmacophore, drawing attention to the critical nature of the ring-C region (stereochemistry and functionality) and subtleties that are manifest. Further structure-activity studies and biological assays aimed at elucidating the mechanism of action of these derivatives is in progress in our laboratories. Based on the structural similarity of the active compounds to that of pancratistatin, one can hypothesize that these compound could trigger apoptosis by activating Fas-associated Caspase-3, or by destabilizing mitochondria in Jurkat cells as has been previously observed (Griffin et al., 2007, McLachlan et al., 2005).
