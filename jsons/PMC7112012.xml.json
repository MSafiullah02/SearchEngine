The genome organization is similar to those of other coronaviruses [2]. The most common presenting symptoms in SARS patients are fever, chills, rigor, myalgia, cough, headache, and dizziness [4]. Less common symptoms include sputum production, sore throat, coryza, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea [4].",

Previously, a platelet count of < 150 \u00d7 109/l was documented in 44.8% of the SARS patients (n\n = 138) in our hospital [4]. A prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time greater than 38 s was noted in 42.8% of the SARS patients, whereas the prothrombin time remained normal in most cases. In 45.0% of the SARS patients, the D-dimer level was also elevated [4]. In one of our later reports, the common hematological changes found in SARS patients (n\n = 157) included thrombocytopenia (55%), thrombocytosis (49%), and isolated prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time > 40 s (63%) [5]. The mechanism of how coronavirus causes thrombocytopenia and subsequent thrombocytosis have not been well understood, neither does the role TPO play in the process. In this study, TPO levels in plasmas from SARS patients, the effect of these plasmas on in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis, and whether SARS-CoV can directly infect hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytic cells are investigated.",

It is found that plasma from active SARS patients had an inhibitory effect on CFU-MK formation (42 \u00b1 8 colonies/2 \u00d7 105 cells, n\n = 7), comparing to that from convalesced SARS patients (66 \u00b1 10 colonies/2 \u00d7 105 cells, n\n = 10, p\n = 0.01) and normal control (58 \u00b1 6 colonies/2 \u00d7 105 cells, n\n = 10, p\n = 0.04). Previous studies showed an increased TGF-\u03b2 level in active SARS patients [13], [14], suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 related cytokine storm triggered by viral infection might be involved in the inhibition of megakaryocytopoiesis, which lead to thrombocytopenia. To test this hypothesis, anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibodies were added to the plasma clot culture system. We observed that the inhibitory effect of the plasma from active SARS plasma on CFU-MK formation could be neutralized (55 \u00b1 8 colonies/2 \u00d7 105 cells, n\n = 7, p\n = 0.05) by the antibodies, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 may be involved in this inhibitory process.",

This is likely due to the fact that platelets express TPO receptor c-mpl, through which TPO can be removed from the circulation [17]. Under disease conditions, the production of TPO can be enhanced by inflammatory mediators, which increase TPO transcription and production from the liver and bone marrow stromal cells directly [17], suggesting that the TPO level is more under the influence of productional control than the platelet numbers. Consistent with these observations, we also found an increase of TPO levels in SARS patients with an increase of platelet counts. The plasma with increased TPO promoted in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis, explaining the frequent occurrence of thrombocytopenia and subsequent thrombocytosis in SARS patients, possibly after the release from TGF-\u03b2 related inhibition during the recovery phase.",

Elucidation of the mechanisms of how coronavirus infection causes cytopenias is important for better management of this disease. In general, virus may directly infect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, inducing their growth inhibition and apoptosis, although we were unable to observe an active infection of blood cells by the virus in our study. Furthermore, a general virus infection may cause immune damages to the blood cells by inducing auto-antibodies and immune complexes [6]. In the case of thrombocytopenia associated with SARS-CoV infection, another potential mechanism may also be involved. Specifically, the lungs of SARS patients showed diffused alveolar damage [4]. The damaged lung tissue and pulmonary endothelial cells may cause the activation and entrapment of platelets in the lungs, along with the thrombi formation at the sites of the injury, may lead to the consumption of platelets subsequently [20], [21]. In addition, the lungs may also be the sites of platelet release from mature megakayocytes. In this case, the damaged lungs may result in pulmonary fibrosis and pathological changes, affecting the lung megakaryocyte fragmentation and platelet production [20], [21]. Taken together, the increased consumption of platelet or/and the decreased production of platelet may lead to thrombocytopenia.",
