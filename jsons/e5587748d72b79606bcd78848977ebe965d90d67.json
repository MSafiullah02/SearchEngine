Methods Nasal lavage and induced sputum were collected prior to inoculation (day 0) and 2, 4 and 17 days later. Differential cell counts were performed and supernatant was assayed for IL-8, IL-5, IFN-g, and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP). Results There was no difference between the two groups in any measurement at baseline. In both groups, during colds the volume of nasal secretion increased as did leucocyte counts in both upper and lower respiratory tracts. A modest increase in nasal neutrophil count was seen in both EVW and control groups with symptomatic colds on day 2 (median (quartile) difference from baseline 5.4 (0.0, 11.0) and 1.8 ( \u00c0 1.1, 2.2) \u00c2 10 4 /mL of secretions, respectively). The change in nasal neutrophil counts in all subjects correlated with nasal symptom scores. A significant relative increase in sputum differential neutrophil count was seen on day 4 in the EVW group with a cold but not in controls (mean difference (95% confidence interval) 20.4 (9.6, 31.1)% and 3.1 ( \u00c0 8.2, 14.5)%, respectively, Po0.01); however, this increase did not correlate with lower respiratory tract symptom scores. IL-8 increased in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts in both EVW and control subjects with colds, the largest change being seen on day 4 in the sputum of those with EVW (mean difference from baseline (95% confidence interval) 2.5 (0.55-4.46) ng/mL). Only modest changes were seen in IFN-g and no changes were seen in IL-5 or ECP. None of the results was influenced by the atopic status of the subjects in either group. Conclusions EVW wheeze is characterized by neutrophilic inflammation in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts without eosinophilia (even in atopic subjects).

HCoV, the second most prevalent common cold virus, is known to be associated with exacerbations of asthma in children [16] and with pre-school wheeze [17] . Also, symptoms may be virusdependent [18] , so it is important to study viruses other than HRV.

We now report further analysis of this model to test the hypotheses that during symptomatic experimental URTI with HCoV 229E (1) a qualitative or quantitative difference in lower respiratory tract cellular infiltration distinguishes subjects with EVW from controls, (2) cellular changes seen in the LRT are qualitatively similar in nature to those seen in the URT, and (3) there is an association between the quantitative changes in the LRT and both symptoms and change in bronchial responsiveness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 573, "end": 577, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 605, "end": 609, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 649, "end": 653, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 897, "end": 900, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study design, symptom scores and physiological measurements have been reported elsewhere [4] and will be described briefly.

This neutrophilia was associated with the LRT symptoms as previously reported [4] . Both groups had evidence of increased leucocytes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts during colds, although the small number of controls makes quantitative comparisons insensitive.
