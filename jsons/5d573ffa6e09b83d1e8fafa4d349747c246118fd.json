At first, we shall try to look for answers to some of the most important questions regarding the connection between intelligent systems and healthcare. What are intelligent systems? How can they be used in healthcare? Have they got benefits and prospects? Let us highlight some of the decisive factors for a successful deployment of intelligent systems in healthcare, including intelligent clinical support and intelligent patient management.",

            "text": "To have a more comprehensive understanding of this concept, let us to go back to the year 1950, and see what A.M. Turing said about the 'thinking machines'. In Turing [1] , Turing had to answer the following question \"Can machines think?\" Analyzing different aspects related to this 'simple' question, he concluded that the problem should be reformulated as follows: \"The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game'. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is B\" or \"X is B and Y is A\". The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B\", with the answers, ideally, typewritten; the question is related to sex \"C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?\" In this context, Turing brought up the issue: \"We now ask the question, 'What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?'. Summarizing the above, if we assume that we have a person, a machine, and an interrogator, then the object of the 'imitation game' for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the person, and which is the machine. However, the story does not end here, because \"The question we put \u2026 will not be quite definite until we have specified what we mean by the word 'machine.'\" Turing concludes that \"We are the more ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in 'thinking machines' has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called an 'electronic computer' or 'digital computer'. Following this suggestion we only permit digital computers to take part in our game.\" Starting from this presentation, we come to the phrase \"The Turing test\", as a way of answering the question whether machines can think or not. An interesting fact, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [2] , is the idea that the Turing's test has deeper roots in history. Thus, it is suggested that the Turing test is foreshadowed in R. Descartes' \"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting one's Reason and Seeking Truth in the Sciences\", or, shortly \"Discourse on the Method (1637)\". Finally, let us mention that there are currently opinions that say the classical Turing test is out of date and that we need to find other ways to measure the machines' \"intelligence\" [3] [4] [5] [6] . In this context, different approaches have emerged to assess the Turing test capacity to detect the presence of consciousness. We can mention the Chinese room argument [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy], which is an experiment of John Searle [7] designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the 'room' can behave or function as a conscious mind would ( Fig. 1.1) .",

If we consider that a computer is deemed to have Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, if it can mimic human responses under specific conditions, everything is clear, but (AI) is more than a question of imitation, it is a matter of understanding. There are many ways to describe the concept of AI. According to Encyclopedia Britannica [Encyclopaedia Britannica], AI means \"the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings\", having thus the capabilities of \"developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.\" It is noteworthy that Turing has provided the earliest significant work regarding AI, the first manifesto, all modern computers being considered as \"Turing machines\". In an unpublished 1948 report, entitled \"Intelligent Machinery\", he introduced many of the central concepts of AI. More details about A. Turing and his substantial contribution to AI, including the report mentioned above, are to be found in Copeland [8] .",

In this regard, let us mention the \"Dartmouth AI Project Proposal\", by J. McCarthy (Dartmouth College), M. L. Minsky (Harvard University), N. Rochester (IBM Corporation), and C.E. Shannon (Bell Telephone Laboratories)- August 31, 1955 , states that \"We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial (http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html accessed November 24, 2017). \u2022 A milestone for the use of AI in real-world applications was the idea of creating a 'perfect machine translator', funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Unfortunately, two reports (Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report-1966, and Lighthill report-1973) \"concluded negatively about the possibility of creating a machine that could learn or be considered intelligent\". \u2022 Another landmark in AI history was the occurrence of the \"expert systems\" in the eighties, giving a 'breather' to the field by UK and Japan funding. It is noteworthy that expert systems first emerged in the early 1950s when the Rand-Carnegie team of Newell, Shaw, and Simon developed a General Problem Solver that dealt with theorems proof, geometric problems and chess playing. \u2022 Another revival of the AI field began in 1993 with the MIT \"Cog\" project, aiming to build a humanoid robot, and with the Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool (DART), aiming to optimize and schedule transportation of supplies or personnel and solve other logistical problems, used by U.S. military. \u2022 We now reach February 10, 1996, when \"Deep Blue\", the chess-playing super computer developed by IBM, won its first game against a world champion, Garry Kasparov. Overall, Kasparov defeated Deep Blue by a score of 4-2. However, in 1997, after a heavily upgrade, Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in a rematch, the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions (score 3.5/2.5). It is noteworthy that C.E. Shannon was the first to think about developing a chess-playing program. Then, until 2012, the AI development has materialized mainly through academic  research, with no significant practical impact. The milestone was December 4,  2012, when a convolutional neural network was presented at the Neural  Information Processing Systems-NIPS 2012 Conference (Advances in Neural  Information Processing Systems 25) . Since then, the AI development trend has been steadily increasing.",

Among the leading global publishers of AI journals (books) that serve and support the research community, we can quote Springer, Elsevier, Wiley, IEEE, ACM, etc. Because of the substantial significance related to the AI field, both from theoretical and Since in the past and, mainly, in the recent years, we have been experiencing an exponential growth of the AI/IS development, every year many prestigious international conferences, covering the most diverse aspects of the field, take place in the most diverse locations worldwide. As examples of such recent events, we mention the following ones: The impetuous development that AI has known, led to the emergence of an intensely debated issue today by well-known scientists as well as ordinary people. The question is: What scares us when we see the unprecedented development of AI? Most people worry about the occurrence of the \"singularity point\", that is the milestone in history when AI will surpass human intelligence and its consequences. Below we list the opinions of some famous people in this area. To conclude, the AI's existential risk resides in the possibility that substantial progress in AI could someday result in human extinction, or some other unrecoverable global catastrophe (see also Wikipedia: \"Existential risk from artificial general intelligence\") (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_ artificial_general_intelligence#Reactions-accessed November 24, 2017)",

This complex interaction includes empathy, information management, application of expertise in a given context, negotiation with multiple stakeholders, and unpredictable physical response in special situations, such as surgery or post-op, some actions taking place in real time (for instance, patient on the operating table or patient in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit)). In this context, we are wondering: \"Are these important real-life aspects viable AI-applications or not?\" Obviously, these are not AI-applicable functions. Thus, according to a study regarding the way a physician spends his/her time at work (U.S. ambulatory care in four specialties in four states) [106] , it resulted that physicians spent 27.0% of their total time on direct clinical face time with patients and 49.2% of their time on EHR (Electronic Health Record), and desk work during the office day. Under these circumstances, physicians have less time to directly practice medicine, do necessary research, master new medical/ AI technology, and improve their skills in order to become better doctors. To conclude, apart from the measures that need to be taken to increase the doctor-patient interaction time against the clerical work, it will be important for physicians and patients to understand and engage the evolution of automation in medicine in order to optimize the patient care. Physicians must be open to the rapidly advancing AI technology, and, more importantly, they should embrace this opportunity rather than fear it. In this sense, there are many concerns of the medical staff on this subject, due to recent news in the media. Thus, in the near future, robots and AI technologies in healthcare could lead to a doctorless hospital [107] . Although hospitals have been slow in adopting AI technologies and robotics, these new approaches took their place gradually, fundamentally changing the landscape. Thus, doctors in near future will have to have new skills vs. today's doctors (e.g., computer skills, robotics), to successfully compete with the new technologies. Let us hope that we will not turn the current hospitals into robot-factory hospitals. It is noteworthy to mention in this sense, that financial pressures will inevitably force the recognition of the fact that the medical robots, powered by the AI technology, will be the only way to help doctors provide a significantly higher medical service than the current one. If driverless cars are going to reduce traffic accidents and congestion, but under human supervision, then we may hope that the intelligent systems grafted in the hospitals of the future will one day save more lives and reduce the cost of healthcare, without removing doctors from the medical activities and decisions ( Fig. 1.9 ).",

The effectiveness and speed of diagnosis-making differ significantly from a resident with a few years of practice under the supervision of an attending physician to an experienced doctor with many years of medical practice, in which he/she has seen numerous cases.

Thus, we have to tackle datasets with a huge number of variables (attributes), therefore becoming \"suffocated\" by the richness of information.

Starting with the Turing's test to assess the machines' intelligence\", the interaction between human and computers through the natural languages has remained a very important and topical issue even today. In the context of healthcare supported by ISs/AI, we are interested in how to apply NLP to unstructured data. By unstructured data, or unstructured information, we broadly understand information that either does not have a pre-defined data model and/or does not fit well into relational tables. We can mention as unstructured data: health records, documents, images, audio/ video files, analog data, sentiments about a given topic, etc. In the healthcare field, it is very important to have direct information about data or, indirectly, data about data, that is, metadata. For instance, grammar (syntax) is metadata. Both structured languages (e.g., Java), and unstructured languages (e.g., the English language) have grammars, describing them (data about data) by clarifying, for example, the relations between words in a sentence. On the other hand, we may be interested by the meaning/interpretation of words or groups of words within a certain medical narrative context, in order to better understand some symptoms declared by the patient (semantics). For more details regarding natural language understanding of unstructured data, see Trim [111] . There are different NLP techniques for extracting information/knowledge from unstructured data, depending on their type (e.g., texts, images, audio, sentiments, etc.). In the healthcare case, there are both structured and unstructured data, clinical data, for instance, being either in structured or unstructured form. There are clinical data presented in some templates (e.g., tables), i.e., structured data, which can be processed directly by different ML techniques. There are also unstructured clinical data in the form of free text narratives (e.g., observations and/or thoughts regarding the patient, obtained during the doctor-patient dialogue) that can only be addressed with the NLP techniques [92] . The traditional approach to support clinical decision-making by NLP in the case of free text narratives is a two-fold process. Firstly, there is text processing enabling the discovery of disease-relevant keywords in the unstructured data. Secondly, the validated keywords through a sensitivity analysis focused on their effects on the classification of the normal and abnormal cases are used to supplement the available structured data. A well-known example of a computer system, which has been directly applied in NLP for healthcare, is the famous \"IBM Watson\" (https:// www.ibm.com/watson/). IBM announced in 2013 the application of IBM Watson at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City. Watson Oncology is a cognitive computing system designed to support the oncology community of physicians as they consider treatment options with their patients. Concretely, it interprets cancer patients' clinical information and identifies individualized, evidence-based treatment options (https://www.mskcc.org/about/ innovative-collaborations/watson-oncology). Let us also mention, in this context, the natural language application-programming interface (API) from Google-Google Cloud Natural Language (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/). Of the most popular NLP applications we mention just the following ones:",

            "text": "\u2022 Classical and Modern ML/DM Algorithms. ML is a very important topic of Computer Science that study theories, algorithms, and related real-life applications that give computers the ability to learn like humans, in other words, acting without being explicitly programmed. While DM can be seen as the science of exploring big data (large or even huge datasets) for extracting implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information, ML represents the underlying technology to accomplish this task. Depending on the learning paradigm, ML may be broadly classified into learning with a teacher and learning without a teacher. Briefly, learning under the supervision of a 'teacher', or supervised learning, seen as a 'past experience' of the model, means the process of establishing a correspondence between an input and an output, using a training dataset. The purpose of supervised learning is to predict the output value for any new input after completion of the training process, done under the supervision of a 'teacher'. Metaphorically speaking, this is the case of a student who learns from his/her teacher through a question-answer process. The (supervised) classification process represents a classical example of the supervised learning. Unlike supervised learning, in learning without a teacher there is no 'teacher' to monitor the learning process. There are two categories of such a learning paradigm. Firstly, reinforcement learning which aims to connect situations to actions by maximizing a reward (reinforcement) signal. The learning of an input-output mapping is performed by repeated interactions with the environment, in order to maximize the performance, and a \"supervisor\" does not conduct the student's learning process. Secondly, self-organized learning or unsupervised learning which operates with no external 'teacher' (or referee) to monitor the learning process. In the unsupervised learning, the model is adapted to observations, being distinguished by the fact that there is no a priori output (the learner is fed with only questions without answers, therefore, no teacher). Classical examples of unsupervised learning are the clustering process, or outlier detection. In this context, we cannot fail to mention the statistical learning. Briefly, statistical learning (SL) refers to various tools to model and understand complex datasets by using both statistics techniques and ML algorithms. As in the ML case, there is both supervised and unsupervised SL. While supervised SL builds a statistical model for predicting/estimating an output based on one or more inputs, unsupervised SL deals with inputs without supervising output. More about DM, ML, and SL can be found, for instance, in Gorunescu [112] , James et al. [113] , Sugiyama [114] . Below we will provide more details about the mechanisms of DM/ML/SL, along with some healthcare problems they can efficiently solve. \u2022 Classification/Decision-Making. First, let us explain from a theoretical point of view the notion of classification/decision-making, also known as pattern recognition, class prediction or discriminant analysis. Thus, (supervised) classification represents a specific regression analysis from the statistical modeling point of view. Based on one or more independent variables (called predictor variables), this particular type of regression has to predict a categorical dependent variable (called grouping variable). From the AI/ML point of view, the predictor variables represent the object's features, while the grouping variable represents the class label. To conclude, given a set of features, one has to guess the class label, this 'guess' being called a decision, and the process itself is called decisionmaking. In this context, the process of automatic diagnosis, supported by ISs, represents practically a classification issue. Taking into account the signs and symptoms of a patient, he/she must be classified into one of the possible classes corresponding to the different types of possible diseases which can cause these signs/symptoms. The process of classification is based on four basic components:",

The idea behind this paradigm is to build many trees using random objects sampled from a dataset. Seen as an extension of CART, RF builds a multiple CART model with different sample and different initial variables. A random vector is generated for the kth tree, independently from the random vectors corresponding to the (k -1) past trees, and the remaining data are used for class prediction. In this way, we can consider RF like bootstrapping algorithm with CART model. Among the main advantages of RF let us mention the ability of managing a large number of variables (features), performing a sensitivity analysis (i.e., ranking variables according to the impact on the class variable), providing information about the relation between the variables and the classification, handling missing values, no overfitting, detecting interactions between variables, etc. Instead of growing a single tree, RF grows many trees. To classify a new (still unclassified) object, corresponding to an input vector, we assign the vector to each of the trees in the forest. Then, just like in a voting system, each tree \"votes\" for a certain class and RF chooses the classification having the most votes over all the trees in the forest [115] , (https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/*breiman/RandomForests/).",

            "text": "\u2022 Artificial Neural Networks. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or, simply, neural networks (NNs) may be regarded as non-programmed (non-algorithmic) adaptive information processing systems. NNs learn from examples and behave like the human brain. While the network through the learning process acquires knowledge, the (synaptic) weights, quantifying the intensities of the inter-neuron connections, are used to store the gained knowledge. Once the learning/training process is completed and the synaptic weights are set up, the network is used to classify new objects without known class/label. NN is composed of a large number of interconnected processing elements (artificial neurons), working in parallel to solve a specific problem. Basically, NN consists of the input units fed with information from the environment, the computational units within the network (hidden neurons), controlling the actions in the network, and the output units, which synthesize the network's response. Perhaps the most known and used type of NN is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), consisting of multiple layers of computational units, usually interconnected in a feed-forward way. Each neuron in one layer is directly connected to the neurons of the subsequent layer, and the computational units use a certain activation function, usually a hyperbolic tangent function. It is noteworthy that, according to the universal approximation theorem for NNs, just a one hidden layer MLP (3-layer MLP) can approximate arbitrarily closely every continuous function, mapping intervals of real numbers to some output interval of real numbers. The way NN is used for classification is relatively simple. In the training phase, the correct class for each record is known (supervised training), and the output nodes can assign correct values or not. Then, one compares the network's computed values for the output nodes to the target values, after that it calculates an error term for each node. The errors are then propagated back through the network. The errors are used to adjust the synaptic weights so that, during the next iteration, the output values will be closer to the target values. The iterative learning process consists in the presentation of the training samples to the network one at a time, and the weights associated with the input values being adjusted each time, this process being often repeated a certain number of epochs. The idea behind this learning paradigm is that the network is trained by adjusting the synaptic weights in order to predict the correct class label of input samples. Once the NN architecture has been designed (structure complexity and parameters), the network is ready to be trained. To start this process, the initial weights are chosen randomly and the training process begins. Once the learning phase has been completed and the synaptic weights have been adjusted, the network is ready to classify new (unlabeled) cases. Advantages of NNs include the high tolerance to noisy data, as well as the ability to classify patterns on which they have not been trained (unsupervised NNs). For more details, see Gorunescu [112] , Haykin [117] . \u2022 Deep Learning. NNs, developed in the 1950s, attempted to simulate the way the brain worked in greatly simplified form due to the computational constraints at that moment. It has been demonstrated that \"shallow\" NNs, i.e., feedforward NNs with a single hidden layer of finite size have the capacity to approximate continuous functions, result subsequently generalized to feed-forward multi-layer architectures (see universal approximation theorem). As it is well known, the basic idea underlying the continuing development of NNs was to build an algorithm attempting to mimic the activity in layers of neurons in the neocortex, a part of the cerebral cortex where the thinking occurs (higher-order brain functions, such as sensory perception, cognition, spatial reasoning and language, etc.). However, NNs have led to many disappointments as compared to other breakthroughs. Rapid development of modern computing tools, and improvements in mathematical formulas, enable computer scientists to build up NNs with a large number of layers than ever before, which is infeasible for classical ones. Under these circumstances, deep learning (DL) is a modern extension of the classical NNs paradigm. Simplifying, one can view DL as a NN with many layers, in an attempt to mimic better the human neocortex. The other reason for the recent popularity of DL is the increase of the data volume and complexity (big data). Among the most popular DL applications we can mention automatic speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, image restoration, healthcare, etc. Medical records such as doctors' reports, test results and medical images are a gold mine of health information for DL. A clear majority of DL techniques is used in imaging analysis, which makes sense given that images are naturally complex and high volume. Medical images such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays are among the most important tools doctors use in diagnosing diseases ranging from spine injuries to heart disease and cancer. Analyzing medical images can often be a difficult and time-consuming process requiring thus predominant use of DL. In the medical applications, the commonly used DL algorithms include convolution neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, deep belief network, and deep neural network. CNN has been developed as a much better alternative to the classical ML algorithms when handling high dimensional data, i.e., data with a large number of traits. In the classical approach for high-dimensional image analysis, the solution is to perform dimension reduction. Firstly, preselect a subset of pixels as features, and, secondly, perform the ML algorithms on the resulting lower dimensional features. However, the usual feature selection procedures may lose information from the images. Alternatively, the inputs for the CNN are the properly normalized pixel values on the images. CNN then transfers the pixel values in the image through weighting in the convolution layers and, alternatively, sampling in the sub-sampling layers. The final output is a recursive function of the weighted input values. The weights are trained to minimize the average error between the outcomes and the predictions [118] . The implementation of a CNN has been included in popular software packages such as Caffe from Berkeley AI Research, CNTK from Microsoft, TensorFlow from Google, Keras. https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep_learning_software. \u2022 Support Vector Machines. Suppose we dispose of a set of objects, and we want to separate them into two distinct classes. Imagine a pasture with many sheep grazing, some white, some black, mixed together. The shepherd who looks after them wants, at some point, to divide them by color. If, ideally, the two types of sheep are well separated by an imaginary straight line (i.e., the white ones placed on one side, the black ones placed on the other side), then the (linear) separation issue for the shepherd is completely solved. Unfortunately, in the real-world case, they are well mixed, and the shepherd's problem becomes much more complicated. The support vector machines (SVMs) bring an efficient solution to this problem, i.e., the linear separation of non-linear mixed objects [112, 117, 119, 120] . In order to understand this solution, the shepherd should know what it means to 'teleport' an object in another space, as in the \"Star Trek\" movies. The idea behind the SVM paradigm is to consider a separation hyperplane (in a higher dimensional space than the one containing the original objects), such that the margin of separation between different types of objects (e.g., white sheet and black sheet) is maximized. To summarize, if the original objects are linearly separable, then there exist a (linear) hyperplane, which separates them. If, as in real-world situations, the original objects are not linearly separable, then the kernel SVM is used based on a separation hyperplane in a high-dimension (kernel space). Thus, SVM employs the kernel trick, i.e., a clever solution to a non-linear separation problem by mapping the original non-linearly separable points into a higher-dimensional space, where a linear classifier exists. For the shepherd's problem, the sheep are 'teleported' into a high-dimensional space where they can be (linearly) separated. In brief, a non-linear classification in the original space is equivalent to a linear classification in the new space, so the main problem remains the linear separation of objects. Under these circumstances, assume the objects are linearly separable. Consequently, there is a linear hyperplane, which separates the two types of objects (e.g., white sheep and black sheep). There could be infinitely many possible such hyperplanes in the absence of additional constraints. For a given hyperplane, the separation between it and the closest object is called margin of separation. The goal of SVM is to find the particular hyperplane, which maximize the margin of separation, the so-called optimal hyperplane (or optimal decision boundary). Let us finally see where the name of SVM comes from. Thus, the \"support vectors\" are those objects that lie closest to the optimal hyperplane. It can be said that they are 'on the border', so they are difficult to classify, but, on the other hand, they play an essential role for SVM. \u2022 k-Nearest Neighbors. Imagine that we are on the edge of a pond and we see more birds on the water. How do we figure out which ones are ducks? A handy solution: using the inductive reasoning of the 'duck test': \"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck\". Returning to the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for pattern recognition, the classification is performed by labeling a new object taking into account the resemblance with the k closest neighboring objects. Given a training dataset and a new object to be classified, a certain similarity \"distance\" between the new object and the training objects is first computed, and the nearest (most similar) k objects are then chosen. The new object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k nearest neighbors according to the similarity. Unlike other classifiers, there is no training phase for k-NN. For this reason, k-NN is considered a lazy learner because it does not learn a discriminative function from the training data, but just \"memorizes\" the training dataset instead. In addition, k-NN is a non-parametric classifier because it does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution. We only need three elements to use it: (a) a set of stored records (training dataset), (b) a similarity 'measure' to compute the resemblance between objects, and (c) the value of k, representing the necessary number of (neighboring) objects for comparison, based on which we will achieve the classification of a new object. Next, computing the 'similarity' between all the training records and the new object, we identify the k nearest objects (most similar k neighbors), and assign the label that is most frequent among the k training records nearest to that object (\"majority voting\"). k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all ML algorithms, being insensitive to outliers, versatile in applications (both classification and regression), having (relatively) high accuracy, and non-parametric feature (no assumptions about data). On the other hand, it is computationally expensive, requires high memory, is sensitive to irrelevant features and the scale of the data, and the prediction speed might be slow for large k. k-NN is particularly well suited for multi-modal classes as well as applications in which an object can have many class labels. \u2022 Genetic Algorithms for Classification/Feature Extraction. The genetic algorithms (GAs) are based on the modern theory of evolution, with roots both in the Darwin's natural selection principle presented in the famous \"Origin of species\" [121] , and in the Mendel's genetics regarding the discreet nature of the hereditary factors transferred from parents to children (\"Versuche uber Pflanzenhybride\"-\"Research about plant hybrids/Experiments in plant hybridization\" (1865)). GAs are considered as the most popular case of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). They represent a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, based on a population of potential solutions and using specific mechanisms inspired by the biological evolution, such as: chromosomes, reproduction, mutation, recombination, selection, and survival of the fittest. GAs consist of a population of chromosomes, and multiple operators: selection according to fitness, crossover to produce new offspring, and random mutation of new offspring. A GA algorithm has the following steps.",

A rule-based classifier uses a set of IF-THEN rules to classify objects in different classes. The process of rule-based classification uses a training dataset of labeled objects from which classification rules are extracted in order to build the classifier. The set of rules are then used in a given order to classify new (unlabeled) objects. The IF part of the rule is called rule antecedent or precondition. The THEN part of the rule is called rule consequent. The antecedent part consists of one or more attribute tests that are logically connected by AND. The consequent part consists of class prediction. Mathematically speaking, a rule is an implication of the form X ! Y, where X represents the rule antecedent (a conjunction of attributes values), and Y represents the rule consequent, representing the class label. Rule-based classifiers have some advantages as compared to other classification algorithms: high expressiveness and performance, easy to interpret, easy to generate, and high classification speed. \u2022 Logistic Regression. Logistic regression (LR) is a statistical classification model, which aims to determine a certain outcome given by a dichotomous variable with two possible states, based on a dataset containing one or more independent predictor/explanatory variables. To understand the logistic regression, let us briefly recall the regressive model. The basic model is the simple linear regression (SLR). SLR is represented mathematically by a linear equation connecting the response (dependent) variable Y with the predictor (independent) variable X Y \u00bc b \u00c1 X \u00fe a \u00f0 \u00de . It is interesting to mention in this context that the regression paradigm has its roots in the work of the famous geneticist Sir Francis Galton regarding \"regression towards the mean\" (\"Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature\", 1886). According to this theory, the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a 'mediocre' point (the mean, actually), opposed to the assumption that extreme characteristics in parents are passed on completely to their offspring. Instead of analyzing bivariate data as in the case of SLR, in most real-life issues the multivariate data are being analyzed. Thus, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model is represented mathematically by a linear equation connecting the response (dependent) variable Y with the predictor (independent) variables X 1 ;",

In different real-world circumstances, such as clinical investigations, there are many situations where several known quantities potentially affect a certain outcome (e.g., patient prognosis). Statistical models are frequently used to analyze survival with respect to several factors simultaneously, providing at the same time the effect size for each factor. In many medical, biological or engineering researches a common issue is to determine whether or not certain continuous (independent) variables are correlated with the survival or failure times. In this context, the first idea that comes to mind is to apply a multiple regression model, but we will end up with two major issues. On the one hand, the dependent variable of interest (i.e., survival/failure time) is most likely not normally distributed, violating thus an assumption for ordinary least squares multiple regression. On the other hand, some observations will be incomplete, the so-called censored data. One of the most known and used survival regression models is the popular Cox's proportional hazard model (Cox PH model). It is the most general survival regression model because it is not based on any assumptions concerning the nature or shape of the underlying survival distribution. No assumptions are made about the nature or shape of the hazard function, the model assuming that the underlying hazard rate, rather than survival time, is a function of the independent variables (covariates). The standard Cox PH model assumes time independent variables, i.e., variables not changing over time (e.g., sex). A more general approach requires an extension to time dependent variables. One of the advantages of the Cox model is its ability to encompass covariates that change over time. The extension of the Cox model to the case of covariates that change over time is known as the Cox's Proportional hazard model with time-dependent covariates. \u2022 Cluster Analysis/Clustering. Cluster analysis or clustering, also called segmentation or taxonomy analysis, is an exploratory data analysis that aims to identify structures within the data. By clustering we mean the technique of dividing a set of data into several groups, called clusters, based on certain predetermined similarities. It is noteworthy that the classification process is different from the clustering process. When we classify a certain object, we assign a certain label to that object, while in clustering we group a set of objects in a certain number of clusters, such that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Given a measure of similarity and a set of objects, each of them characterized by a set of attributes, the clustering issue is how to divide them into groups (clusters) such that:",

In Bellman [124] , has first introduced the term of \"curse of dimensionality\", referring as a phenomenon which often occurs when applying ML algorithms to high-dimensional data. In this situation, \"the number of samples needed to estimate an arbitrary function with a given level of accuracy grows exponentially with respect to the number of input variables (i.e., dimensionality) of the function\" [125] . In the ML practice, there is a maximum number of features in the database, above which the algorithm's performance will decrease rather than increase. To avoid such a situation, one can use the dimensionality reduction technique, obtaining a reduced amount of time and memory required by data processing, better visualization, elimination of irrelevant features and possible noise reduction. As techniques for dimensionality reduction, we can mention typical multivariate exploratory techniques such as factor analysis, principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, canonical correlation, etc. There are usually two different approaches for dimensionality reduction: (a) feature selection (FS), and (b) feature extraction (FE). FS uses different methods for selecting a subset of the existing features, the most significant ones for the proposed purpose (e.g., classification, regression). In this way, the selected subset of variables from the input can efficiently describe the input data. As a result, the effects from noise or irrelevant variables are reduced, and this approach provides prediction at least as good, but with a much lower computing effort. So far along, we may think that IS in healthcare is a real miracle. But can we actually trust its results? Is it possible to measure the machine's performance and if so, can we take comfort in the fact that the measurements are accurate? Fortunately, since 1800 we have Statistics to rely on. Data scientists use statistical methods for comparing classifiers. This is not an easy task to tackle. As stated before, there is no single classifier that works best on all given real-world problems. No classifier offers a 'short-cut'. We can say that this phenomenon is related to David Wolpert and William G. Macready theorem 'No-free-lunch'. Each classification algorithm plays the role of a 'restaurant', providing a certain 'dish' at a certain 'price', thus its up to us to determine the 'smart-deal' [126] .",

For this, we must time travel back on December 7, 1941. We are located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. We are during the World War II, in Pearl Harbor. The radar picked up some unusual behavior, described as a flock of birds. The famous reply concerning this situation was: \"Don't worry about it\". The primitive radar failed to differentiate between enemy aircrafts and birds. 2,403 Americans died that day. 1,178 were wounded. Electrical and radar engineers started developing ROC curves. Since then, they have been used in various applications in medical research [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] .",

A ROC curve is a two-dimensional graph, which plots on the X-axis the FP rate, and on the Y-axis the TP rate. This way we can find the trade-off between the benefits and costs. Now that we see how a ROC curve looks like, we need to interpret it. In order to obtain a good interpretation, we can use the following rule: one point in space is better than another if it is situated to the northwest of the square. Practically, if the TP rate is high and FP rate is low, or both at the same time, the prediction is better. In fact, using the line of no-discrimination, one can say that if the points are above the line, the classification is good, otherwise is poor.",

Still, the estimates have a considerable false-positive rate. Another non-invasive test is the cell-free DNA, but the costs are very high. The same trained ANN can diagnose Turner syndrome also. An automatic ventilation system using AI was developed for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is hard to diagnose, because it has to be differentiated from pneumonia or congestive heart failure. ARDS has no cure and can leave the survivors with diminished functional capacity, mental illness and low quality of life; medical personnel just provide life support for the patient until the lungs start functioning again.

In 1984, the US government started this plan, but the project was launched in 1990 and completed in 2001. In 2003, the human genome sequence, 3 billion DNA bases, was determined. The ultimate goal of the project was to identify correlation between certain gene variations and human diseases. The scientists were looking for the answers to questions such as: Why do some people have cancer or Alzheimer? If you could have your human genome analyzed in order to foresee which disease you will suffer from during your lifetime, would you want to know? Surprisingly enough, it has been found that human disease is rarely linked to specific genetic mutations [157, 158] . This led to the idea that personalized medicine is a combo box of genetics, behavior, environment, family history, life and treatment experiences.",

Yes, there are two AI nurses, Molly-http://www.sensely.com/ -accessed May 5, 2018-developed by the Startup Sense.ly and KidsMD-a new skill created for Amazon Alexa-enabled devices. Molly is a digital nurse that monitors patient's condition and follow up with treatments between patient's visits to the doctor. It is specialized in chronic illnesses. KidsMD is developed by Boston Children's Hospital and answers questions like \"My child has 101.3 fever. What should I do?\" The app answers which medications should be taken and if a doctor's visit is required. Somehow similar, when GOOGLE is told that you have a fever, it points on GOOGLE Maps the closest hospitals. \u2022 Reading X-rays, CT Scans, EKG, EEG, etc. Analyzing these images is time consuming and tiring. Using AI for this, the doctor has the time to focus on the more complicated cases. \u2022 Medication Management.
