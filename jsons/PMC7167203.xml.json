Respiratory tract infections due to hMPV are very common in young children worldwide [Falsey et al., 2003; Maggi et al., 2003; Ebihara et al., 2004; Pierangeli et al., 2007; Carneiro et al., 2009]. Retrospective analyses of nasopharyngeal specimens have identified hMPV as the etiological cause of a significant portion of \u201corphan\u201d acute respiratory\u2010tract infections. The clinical symptoms of hMPV are similar to those caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), ranging from upper respiratory disease to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Caracciolo et al., 2008]. Human MPV has a seasonal distribution with a high prevalence mostly in the winter\u2010spring period [Kashiwa et al., 2004; Caracciolo et al., 2008].",

Children were eligible for inclusion if younger than 15 years of age and if admitted for acute respiratory infection or an acute respiratory disease with a symptom onset fewer than 5 days before hospital admission. The acute respiratory disease classification was based on World Health Organization guidelines [WHO, 1992]. Samples (n = 846) that tested negative for RSV A and B; influenza viruses (FLU) A and B; parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, and 3; and adenoviruses (AdV) based on immunofluorescence studies (Light Diagnostics\u2122, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), as well as for the presence of human rhinoviruses (HRV) by a reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were tested for the presence of hMPV RNA.

All the sequences in the dataset were aligned using CLUSTAL X software, then edited manually with the Bioedit software (version 7.0.9). The phylogenetic tree was estimated using the PAUP* package. The Tamura\u2010Nei (TrN93) model of nucleotide substitution, incorporating maximum likelihood estimates of base composition and the shape parameter (\u03b1) of a gamma distribution (\u0393) model of among\u2010site rate variation was used as it consistently gave a much higher likelihood value using Modeltest v.3\u20137 implemented in PAUP*. A maximum likelihood tree was estimated under this model using tree bisection\u2010reconnection branch swapping. The statistical robustness and reliability of the branching order within each phylogenetic tree were confirmed by bootstrap analysis using 1,000 replicates for the Neighbor\u2010Joining tree and by the Zero Branch Length Test for the maximum likelihood tree [Posada and Crandall, 1998]. The software MEGA 4.1 allowed us to calculate the genetic distances among different clades using the model of nucleotide maximum composite likelihood, including transitions and transversions. The substitution rates were defined as equal among sites, but different among lineages. Gaps were treated by pairwise\u2010deletion, that is, ignoring only the gaps involved in the comparison of a pair of sequences.",

In some cases, coinfections might not have been detected because the respiratory samples were not tested for other potential pathogens such as Coronaviruses and Bocaviruses. In addition, in contrast to the PCR method used for hMPV detection, the other respiratory viruses in the present study were examined by immunofluorescence assays. In general, PCR assays are more sensitive than antigen detection methods [Herrmann et al., 2001].

            "text": "Phylogenetic analyses performed on a partial sequence of the F gene indicated that all hMPV subtypes circulated in Brescia during the study period. The data from the present study confirmed five distinct genetic lineages of hMPV, designated A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2. Most of the strains in Brescia belonged to the A2 lineage. In particular, of the 62 strains analyzed philogenetically, 11 were classified as A1 lineage, 29 as A2 lineage, 12 as B1 lineage, and 10 as B2 lineage. In addition, hMPV sublineages A2a and A2b, originally proposed based on hMPV sequences from specimens obtained in Germany [Huck et al., 2006], were also detected in the present analysis (17 and 12 isolates, respectively). Other studies performed in Europe as well as in other countries [Ljubin\u2010Sternak et al., 2008; Arnott et al., 2011] demonstrated the presence of these sublineages, suggesting their worldwide circulation. Many factors potentially influence the circulation of hMPV strains, including virus infectivity, preexisting immunity in the population and antigenic variability; in particular, the extent of antigenic variability between hMPV subgroups is not clear in animals or humans, but the presence of multiple hMPV strains in a single season could affect the design of vaccines or prophylactic antibodies. If antigenic variability leads to partial immune escape, antigenic variation might have an important role in the ability of different virus strains to escape the preexisting immune response. The present analysis of the mean genetic distances revealed that clade A2 was more heterogeneous than the others. Further investigation of clade A2 is needed, especially because a study by Vicente et al. [2006] suggested that genotype A is more pathogenic than genotype B, thereby causing greater clinical severity in children. A correlation between the infecting subtype and disease severity has also been hypothesized for RSV infection. A postulated mechanism for the alternating circulation of different hMPV subgroups is population immune pressure [Oliveira et al., 2009]. Long\u2010term, prospective, population\u2010based surveillance is needed to establish whether different subgroups of hMPV vary in virulence and whether circulation patterns are the result of immune pressure.",
