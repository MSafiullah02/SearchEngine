Two specific embedded proteases, papain-like (PLpro) and 3C-like (3CLpro), mediate processing of 1a and 1ab precursors into 16 nsps (termed nsp1\u2013nsp16). Phylogenetic tree analysis of CoV genomes indicates HCoV-NL63 forming a subcluster with HCoV-229E, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and Bat-CoV, assigned to the alphacoronaviruses.3 Among all genes, HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid (N) shows a low percentage of nucleotide and amino acid identity compared to other CoVs.2\n",

Reference sequences were chosen from GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). Genotypes and genotypic relationships for HCoV-NL63 1a genes were identified by BioEdit 7.0.8 program (North Carolina State University at Raleigh, NC, USA, http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) to align sequences with reference sequences. Resulting datasets constructed phylogenetic trees for HCoV-NL63 1a genes, using MEGA version 5.2 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/). After maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses in 1000 bootstrap replicates, branch bootstrap values > 60% or p values < 0.05 clustering with specific genotype strains were determined. Cluster robustness could not all be statistically rated at 75% bootstrap due to the large size and high genetic similarity of the data sets, thus, we used 60% to identify epidemic clusters. For further support of lower bootstrap values in cluster node, the maximum likelihood (ML) tree confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.05) in each cluster node.",

The Ct values were 30 for two copies, 27 for 20 copies, and 24 for 200 copies of HCoV-NL63. Melting curve analysis revealed HCoV-NL63 N-specific amplicon melting at 81\u00b0C. The PCR products were separated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, where a 251-bp band was clearly observed in the PCRs with 20 copies and 200 copies of HCoV-NL63 post gels stained with ethidium bromide. The results indicated that the detection limit of the two-step real-time RT-PCR assay was around 20 copies of HCoV-NL63. In addition, cultured supernatants of coxsackie virus 16, enterovirus 71, and influenza viruses were not detectable using two-step real-time RT-PCR assay with HCoV N-specific primers. Therefore, the two-step real-time RT-PCR assay with HCoV N-specific primers had high sensitivity and specificity, as applicable for high-throughput detection of HCoV-NL63 infection.",

All swabs were screened, using rapid diagnostic tests to detect HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses. In hospitalized patients, positive rates of real-time RT-PCR detection were 8.4% (9/107) for HCoV-NL63, 15.9% (17/107) for influenza A/H1N1, 8.4% (9/107) for influenza A/H3N2, and 4.7% (5/107) for influenza B (Table 1\n, Figure 1\nA). Importantly, co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was identified in three hospitalized patients. However, HCoV-NL63 infection was not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness (Table 2\n, Figure 1B). Lower positive rates of influenza A/H1N1 (13.1%), A/H3N2 (2.9%), and B (0.6%) were discovered in outpatients. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 positive cases ranged from 3 years to 79 years (Figure 1A). Interestingly, the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 was the second highest among adults aged 76\u201385 years (1/7, 14.7%), and the highest among young people aged 16\u201325 years (1/5, 20.0%; Figure 1A). In contrast to HCoV-NL63, the positive rates in hospitalized patients were the highest among adults aged 66\u201375 years (3/10, 30.0%), and the lowest among groups aged < 5 years (0/16, 0%) for influenza A/H3N2 infection, as well as the highest among adults aged 36\u201345 years (4/14, 28.6%), second highest among adults aged 56\u201365 years (3/13, 23.1%), and lowest among the group aged 16\u201325 years (0/14, 0%) for influenza A/H1N1 infection (Figure 1C). In addition, positive rates of influenza A/H1N1 in outpatients ranked the highest among adults aged 26\u201335 years (1/5, 20.0%), second highest among children aged 2\u20135 years (17/92, 18.5%), and lowest among the group aged > 36 years (0/18, 0%; Figure 1D).

The proportion of HCoV-NL63 infection in each age-specific group indicated HCoV-NL63 as a high risk factor for pneumonia patients aged 16\u201325 years and 26\u201335 years. Prevalence of HCoV-NL63 was predominant in late winter; co-infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was associated with pneumonia in older adults. Phylogenetic analysis indicated HCoV-NL63 strains in Taiwan were in one of two major clusters based on 1a gene sequences of global strains, showing a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global strains. Transmission of HCoV-NL63 in older adults causes severe low respiratory tract diseases. Our results yield a better understanding of the epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan and contribute information necessary for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.",
