Based on the cut-off values of CPDI, respectively 47.0% and 14.1% of the Iranian adults experienced mild to moderate and severe psychological distress, compared to 29.3% and 5.1% respectively in China.In Iran, females experienced more distress (\u03b2=-3.62, p=0.000), similar to China.Participants' age (\u03b2=0.81, p=0.170) and education level (\u03b2=0.37, p=0.286) did not predict distress as in China (S.. Adults with more children (\u03b2=-1.07, p=0.048) or exercised more (\u03b2=-2.14, p=0.000) felt less distress. Adults who were unsure whether they There is no significant difference between those who were Covid-19 positive and the rest, possibly due to the small number (7) of positive Covid-19 cases in the sample.Our findings suggest that the predictors of distress may vary across countries. While gender and exercise hours predicted distress in both Iran and China, age and education predicted distress in China but not in Iran. Moreover, Iranian adults who worked from home, at the office, or had not worked during and before Covid-19 all reported lower distress that those who suspended working. In comparison, in China, only individuals who went to workplace reported significantly lower distress than those who suspended working(S. Zhang et al., 2020).",
