From the love of splendor, from the indulgences of luxury and from his fondness for amusement, he has familiarized himself with a great number of animals, which may not originally have been intended for his associates. The wolf disarmed of ferocity is now pillowed in the lady\u2019s lap. The cat, the little tiger of our island, whose natural home is the forest, is equally domesticated and caressed.\u201d I assume Dr. Jenner would be amazed, if not appalled at the number and variety of pets owned by people on his island and world wide \u2013 and how pets, wild animals that have contact with pets and people travel, meet and exchange microorganisms. In evaluating the epidemiology of zoonoses there are four major factors to take into account; Geography, the Home, Occupation and together, Habits and Hobbies. Transmission of infections from humans to nonhuman pets has been observed with associated illness. It should be considered especially when either host could be a carrier with reinfection occurring (\u201cping-pong infections\u201d). Two other methods of exposure, Bioterrorism and xenotransplantation, will not be discussed in this chapter.",

An example of this is West Nile Virus that came from the Middle East to New York City and then moved across the continent to the west coast of the United States. It has been postulated that the trip across the Atlantic was via mosquitoes on a plane and that the transcontinental trip was by infected crows or humans or other birds. In addition, wild birds migrating over thousands of miles may bring organisms from and to domesticated or wild avian species and thus to humans.",

Both the organisms are sensitive to beta lactams and augmentin. The most important feature of bites, however, is that anaerobes may flourish in the presence of dead tissue so that drainage is all important. Prevention is dependent on education of children and adults about caution with strange dogs and with their own pet dogs, which may bite because of fear often combined with surprise such as stumbling on the pet. Other infections from dogs may be from organisms carried in their gastrointestinal tracts and hygienic measures must be stressed in all potential hosts, but especially those who are immunocompromised. Particular care should be taken with dogs with loose stools. Dog saliva or sputum may carry Bordetella bronchiseptica, an opportunistic pathogen, which can produce a whooping cough-like illness in the immunocompromised patient. Dog saliva can also be colonized with Yersinia pestis. Leptospira spp. can be passed onto humans from dog urine producing leptospirosis. An increase in incidence of this infection has been reported in humans in suburban areas. Dog fleas and ticks should be controlled as indicated in Table 42.1 as part of routine veterinary care and if found should be removed immediately using tweezers or gloves and dropped in alcohol, a toilet or a campfire.\n",
