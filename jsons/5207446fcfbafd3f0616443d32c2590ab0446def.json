As an in-hospital preparation, JZ-1 has been used in Tongji Hospital for many years to treat various infectious diseases of the lower female genital tract, including cervicitis, vaginitis, genital herpes and condyloma acuminatum. Our previous studies have shown that JZ-1 has curative effects on Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections. Aim of the study: Genital herpes is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and is mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). Current therapies can relieve symptoms in patients but do not cure or prevent the spread of the virus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection and its mechanism, which is based on autophagy induction, to provide new ideas and a basis for the study of antiviral drugs. Materials and methods: Evaluation of the antiviral activity of JZ-1 was conducted by MTT assay and western blotting. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, observations through transmission electron microscopy and experiments with the recombinant lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B were used to monitor autophagic flux in VK2/E6E7 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JZ-1 regulates autophagy, western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression of phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and to detect changes in critical molecules in the pathway after the application of a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, were measured with qRT-PCR. Results: HSV-2 infection inhibited autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells. Further study revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by HSV-2 infection may result in the blocked autophagic flux and inhibited autophagosome and autolysosome formation. JZ-1 exhibited significant antiviral activity in the VK2/ E6E7 cells, which showed increased cell vitality and reduced viral protein expression, namely, earliest virusspecific infected cell polypeptides 5 (ICP5) and glycoprotein D (gD). We found that JZ-1 treatment inhibited the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and promoted autophagy to combat HSV-2 infection, while PI3K inhibitor pretreatment prevented the enhanced autophagy induced by JZ-1. Moreover, JZ-1 attenuated the increase in inflammatory cytokines that had been induced HSV-2 infection. Conclusion: Our results showed that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 infection, and this beneficial effect may be mediated by inducing autophagy via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Genital herpes is one of the most common, persistent and highly contagious sexually transmitted diseases in the world and is mainly caused by HSV-2. HSV-2 affects approximately 16% of the world's population in the age range of 15-49 years (Looker et al., 2008) , and it has been shown to increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sexual acquisition (Freeman et al., 2006) . Currently, antiviral drugs are mainly based on three nucleoside analogs: acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir. These drugs significantly inhibit virus replication and improve symptoms in patients, but cannot cure the infection or prevent the spread of HSV-2, and the problem of drug resistance is becoming increasingly pronounced. Patients with impaired immune function may not benefit from the treatment. Besides, the HSV-2 vaccine efficacy trials with individuals with recurrent HSV-2 infection were mostly unsuccessful (Hofstetter et al., 2014) . Therefore, the development of new antiviral drugs continues to be explored by scientists and technicians.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 260, "text": "(Looker et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 372, "end": 394, "text": "(Freeman et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 922, "end": 947, "text": "(Hofstetter et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "As a cellular defense mechanism, autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic pathway, has received increasing attention in the defense of microbes. Autophagy is a cell homeostasis process that is maintained by fusion of autophagosomes, consisting of intracellular protein aggregates and damaged organelles coated with a double layer of isolated membrane, with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Autophagy reportedly removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, protects cells from nutrient deprivation and microbial infections, and prevents metabolic, heart and neurodegenerative diseases (He et al., 2017) . Increasing evidence suggests that host cells attempt to control herpesvirus infection by activating autophagy (Cavignac and Esclatine, 2010) . In addition, a number of studies have shown that viruses and intracellular bacteria have evolved to antagonize autophagy initiation or autophagosome maturation, evade autophagy recognition molecules and block autophagic flux (Levine et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014) . Since autophagy can promote innate and adaptive immunity and eliminate intracellular pathogens (xenophagy) (Deretic et al., 2013) , enhancing autophagy may be a potential means of fighting viral infection, including herpes virus infection. While many studies on Herpesviridae subfamilies have focused on HSV-1, VAV and HSMV, few studies have been conducted on HSV-2 (Cavignac and Esclatine, 2010) , which is the cause of genital herpes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 589, "end": 606, "text": "(He et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 719, "end": 749, "text": "(Cavignac and Esclatine, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 977, "end": 998, "text": "(Levine et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1016, "text": "Liu et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1148, "text": "(Deretic et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1415, "text": "(Cavignac and Esclatine, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), genital herpes and its complications fall under the categories of \"sore of vulvae\" and \"erosion of vulva\". According to TCM theory, genital herpes is mainly caused by attack of the wind, dampness and heat, an overload of liver fire and kidney deficiency. It is well accepted that various factors may invade the human body to disturb the normal circulation of qi and blood and block the meridians, the damp heat of the liver meridian down to the genital area, eventually leading to a \"sore of vulvae\". The onset stage is dominated by dampness and heat, while the remission stage is dominated by deficiency because recurrent attacks cause heat injury to body fluids, causing Yin deficiency. Therapeutically, it is essential to disperse the wind, resolve the dampness and clear the heat in the early stage, and strengthen the kidney and nourish the Yin during repeated attacks (Kuang et al., 2016) . Yihuang Tang is a classic prescription composed of Dioscorea opposita Thunb. (Dioscoreae Rhizoma), Euryale ferox Salisb. (Euryales Semen), Phellodendron chinense Schneid. (Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex), Plantago asiatica L. (Plantaginis Semen) and Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgo Semen), which is mainly used for female leukorrheal diseases caused by spleen deficiency and damp heat. Some experimental, clinical, and observational studies have shown that Yihuang Tang exerts a satisfactory effect on genital mycoplasma infection caused by dampness and heat (Tan, 2017; Zhou and Gao, 2018) and damp-heat syndrome vaginitis (Wang et al., 2016) . Genital herpes is mostly in the damp-heat syndrome stage, showing typical symptoms of dampness and heat. Therefore, strengthening the application of heat-clearing and dampness-resolving prescriptions is necessary. JZ-1 is derived from Yihuang Tang As an external preparation, JZ-1 has been used in Tongji Hospital for many years, and has had a definite effect on female genital tract infections, such as vaginitis and cervicitis. In addition, we have already conducted clinical trials of 310 patients whose symptoms include vaginal congestion, cervical erosion, abnormal leucorrhea, genital itching, and frequent urination to verify and confirm the protective effects of JZ-1 on cervicitis caused by U. urealyticum (Wei et al., , 2008 . Our previous research showed that JieZe-2(composed of JZ-1 and the spermicide nonoxynol-9 (N-9) can prevent C. albicans and T. vaginalis infection in vivo and in vitro (Chen et al., 2009a (Chen et al., , 2009b (Chen et al., , 2009c . Taken together, these results suggest that JZ-1 is a valid prescription for dampheat syndrome, with an action similar to that of Yihuang Tang. Furthermore, some studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicines that can clear heat or remove dampness have an excellent effect on HSV-2 infection (Cheng et al., 2008a (Cheng et al., , 2008b Chin et al., 2010; Sheng, 2010) . Therefore, we investigated the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection in vitro, and fond it to be a potent anti-HSV-2 herbal medicine. Our previous experiments showed that JZ-1 decoction could protect human vaginal epithelial cells against HSV-2. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 is superior to that of berberine or penciclovir, and the effect is mainly achieved by augmenting the host cell defenses ability and blocking the adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 (Duan et al., 2019) . In a model of HSV-2-infected VK2/E6E7 cells, the expression of the HSV-2 envelope protein gD increased gradually over time, and JZ-1 reduced this gD expression but had no effect on HVEM in the human vaginal epithelial cells infected by HSV-2 (Ai and Chen, 2017; Qiao and Chen, 2016) . Moreover, the mechanism involved in the anti-HSV-2 action of JZ-1 may be related to the regulation of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and likely is promoted by the secretion of interferon and other downregulating inflammatory factors (Huang and Chen, 2018) . However, the related antiviral mechanism of JZ-1 is not fully understood and needs further explanation. Recent studies have shown that HSV-2 blocks autophagic flux but host cells increase autophagy levels to inhibit viral infection in the later stages of the viral replication cycle (Kristen et al., 2015; Petrovski et al., 2014) . Therefore, this study explored the underlying mechanisms of JZ-1 in treating HSV-2 infection by inducing autophagy. Our study provides the basis for further development of this formulation as a Chinese herbal therapeutic agent for the treatment or prevention of genital herpes caused by HSV-2 infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 913, "end": 933, "text": "(Kuang et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1498, "text": "(Tan, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1518, "text": "Zhou and Gao, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1571, "text": "(Wang et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2308, "text": "(Wei et al., , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2479, "end": 2498, "text": "(Chen et al., 2009a", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2499, "end": 2520, "text": "(Chen et al., , 2009b", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2542, "text": "(Chen et al., , 2009c", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2863, "text": "(Cheng et al., 2008a", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2886, "text": "(Cheng et al., , 2008b", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2887, "end": 2905, "text": "Chin et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2918, "text": "Sheng, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3372, "end": 3391, "text": "(Duan et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3636, "end": 3655, "text": "(Ai and Chen, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3656, "end": 3676, "text": "Qiao and Chen, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3922, "end": 3944, "text": "(Huang and Chen, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4230, "end": 4252, "text": "(Kristen et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4253, "end": 4276, "text": "Petrovski et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1817, "end": 1821, "text": "Tang", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "JZ-1 consists of 10 traditional Chinese medicines, and the details of the herbal ingredients are shown in Table 1 .

Changes in LC3B provide a handy marker of autophagy that can be monitored by immunofluorescence and western blotting. In addition, as autophagic flux increases, SQSTM1/p62, another autophagy marker, is recruited to autophagosomes (Klionsky et al., 2016) .

Increased LC3B-II levels may be the result of autophagy activation or reduced autophagic turnover due to defects in the late stages of autophagic degradation. Was the increased LC3B-II level induced by HSV-2 infection due to the activation of autophagy or reduced autophagy-related protein turnover? Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) was used to determine the cause for the increased level of LC3B-11. Baf A1 is a V-ATPase inhibitor that inhibits autophagosome degradation by blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and we used it to monitor changes in autophagic flux (Shacka et al., 2006) . The immunofluorescence and Western blot data showed that the numbers of LC3B puncta and the LC3B-II and SQSTM1/p62 protein expression levels were both decreased in the Baf A1+HSV-2 treated group compared with puncta numbers and expression levels in the Baf A1 group (Fig. 2) , suggesting that autophagosome turnover was blocked in the HSV-2-infected cells. Consistently, the protein expression of autophagy-related Atg5 in the HSV-2-infected cells was decreased compared with that in the control group cells. To better study the effect of HSV-2 infection on autophagic flux, the VK2/E6E7 cells were transfected with the mRFP-GFP-LC3B lentivirus, which served as a reporter of autophagic flux (Kimura et al., 2007) . Since the GFP signal is pH sensitive, this method can be used to quantify the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. The yellow spots represent overlapping red and green spots, indicating autophagosomes that have not fused with lysosomes, while the red spots correspond to autolysosomes (Klionsky et al., 2016) . Twenty-four hours after infection, we found a marked increase in the number and proportion of yellow puncta in the cells infected with HSV-2 compared with the number and proportion in the nontreated cells (Fig. 3B) .

The results from qRT-PCR assays and Western blot analyses showed that, compared with that of the control, the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR (p-Akt and p-mTOR) in the HSV-2-infected cells were significantly increased, and these proteins all were decreased significantly in the JZ-1+HSV-2 group (Figs. 5B, Fig. 7C ).

Journal of Ethnopharmacology 254 (2020) 112611 host cells following the key steps: virus entry, viral gene expression, viral DNA synthesis, and assembly/egress of progeny virions (Taylor et al., 2002) . The virus is taken into the cell by direct fusion with the cell membrane (independent of pH changes) or by endocytosis mediated by specific cell receptors. Both gD and the ICP5 of HSV play essential roles in the two uptake processes described above (Spear et al., 2000) . Regardless, the binding of viral glycoproteins to cell attachment sites, usually heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), mediates the entrance of HSV-2 (Shukla and Spear, 2001) . It has been reported that glycoproteins B and C (gB and gC) of HSV-2 are also necessary for the initiation of virus-to-cell attachment. Therefore, the expression levels of the related viral proteins can represent the degree of virus infection and the activity of antiviral drugs. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process involving the formation of a bilayer membrane structure called an autophagosome that phagocytoses cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles and delivers them to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy can be divided into three classic types: chaperone-mediated autophagy, microautophagy and macroautophagy, the most extensively studied autophagy (simply referred to as autophagy) (Deretic et al., 2013) . As one of the body's immune mechanisms against pathogen infection, autophagy selectively recognizes and removes invading pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses (Sui et al., 2017) . Upon induction, phagophores elongate and subsequently enclose a portion of the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of autophagosomes. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome (forming the autolysosome), in which the contents of the autophagosome are degraded. In this process, the At-g12-Atg5-Atg16 complex binds to the outer membrane and then dissociates upon completion of the autophagosome. Upon receiving the signal to induce autophagy, Atg7 and Atg3 mediate the conjugation of LC3-I to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3B-II. LC3B-II integrates into both the outer and inner membranes of the autophagosome and facilitates membrane elongation and closure. SQSTM1/p62 is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes through direct binding to LC3; at the end of autophagy, both proteins are effectively degraded. The total cellular expression level of SQSTM1/p62 inversely correlates with autophagic activity, while the LC3B-II level positively correlates with autophagic activity (Mizushima et al., 2010) . As mentioned in the Introduction, autophagy pathways and autophagy proteins play crucial roles in combating viral infections. Several studies have found that repression of autophagy led to increased viral replication and pathogenesis (Orvedahl et al., 2010) , whereas its activation decreased virus infection (Clark et al., 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 661, "end": 720, "text": "Shao, et al.

The function of Dictamni Cortex is to clear heat and eliminate dampness, induce detoxification, clear hurricane and itching. The function of Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma is dehumidification and detoxification. Moutan Cortex has the function of clearing heat, cooling blood and removing blood stasis. It is used in TCM as a hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory herb, which can effectively prevent the entry of HCV and the related Zika flavivirus virus (Behrendt et al., 2017; Poon et al., 2011) . Menthae Haplocalycis Herba has the effect of dispelling wind and heat, relieving sore throat, promoting eruption. All these medicines are used together to treat abnormal leukorrhea and erosion of the vulva of genital herpes caused by attack of wind, dampness, heat and toxin, and can achieve good antiviral effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 475, "end": 493, "text": "Wang et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 672, "end": 690, "text": "(Kim et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1113, "text": "(Yoshikawa et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1263, "text": "(Haruyama and Nagata, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1510, "text": "(Javed et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1758, "text": "(He et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2929, "end": 2946, "text": "(Li et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3398, "end": 3421, "text": "(Behrendt et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3422, "end": 3440, "text": "Poon et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2185, "end": 2191, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our results showed that JZ-1 could significantly reduce the expression of the viral proteins gD and ICP5 in HSV-2-infected VK2/E6E7 cells, suggesting that it also exerts a significant anti-HSV-2 effect. As the main active ingredient in Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex, berberine can induce autophagy by activating the AMPK pathway to inhibit mTOR signaling (Fan et al., 2015) . Dandelion root extract has the potential to induce autophagy (Ovadje et al., 2012) . It has been shown that paeonol (2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone), isolated from the Moutan Cortex, can up-regulate autophagy by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, and the autophagy inhibitor CQ notably attenuates paeonol-induced autophagy . Cao et al. proved that Ginkgo Semen leaf extract can restore autophagy through inhibition of mTOR signaling (Cao et al., 2017) . Based on this evidence, we postulate that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 by inducing autophagy, a supposition confirmed in our later experiments. The TEM images, the mRFP-GFP-LC3B lentivirus reporter observations and results from applying autolysosome inhibitor Baf A1 showed that JZ-1 induces autophagy flux. To confirm whether JZ-1 exerts antiviral effects by regulating autophagy, we treated cells with the autophagy inducer Rapa and inhibitor 3-MA, which are widely used at the early stage of autophagy. 3-MA inhibits class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) as well as class III PtdIns3Ks. Class I enzymes generate products such as PtdIns (3,4,5) P3, which inhibit autophagic sequestration, whereas the class III product (PtdIns3P) generally stimulates autophagic sequestration. 3-MA has different temporal patterns of inhibition, causing long-term suppression of the class I PI3Ks but only transient inhibition of the class III form of the enzyme. Therefore, the correct concentration and incubation times are important for interpreting the final results. We conducted many treatment duration and concentration experiments and pretreated the cells with 2.5 mM 3-MA for one-half hour finally.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 373, "text": "(Fan et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 437, "end": 458, "text": "(Ovadje et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 713, "end": 730, "text": "Cao et al. proved", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 821, "end": 839, "text": "(Cao et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "One hypothesis has suggested that the antiviral response of autophagy is controlled by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Shelly et al., 2009) , which is known as a key regulator of autophagy. Research has shown that HSV-2 infection results in the activation of PI3K and Akt in the host cells, and BX-795 (a PI3K inhibitor) treatment inhibited HSV-2induced Akt phosphorylation and activation, thus decreasing viral replication . mTOR is a downstream target of the PI3K/ Akt pathway, and other studies have confirmed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibits autophagy (Wullschleger et al., 2006) . This evidence suggests that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may be a regulatory mechanism of autophagy during HSV-2 infection. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy induction by JZ-1 in the HSV-2 infection model, we assessed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in our study. Our results showed that the autophagy induced by JZ-1 might be mediated upon inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The use of LY, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, to block the JZ-1induced autophagy confirmed this molecular mechanism. Some limitations of our study are noted. For example, after using LY, the expression of the HSV-2 virus proteins gD and ICP5 could have been further explored to clarify the relationship between the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway and the virulence of the infection and the replication rate of HSV-2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 139, "text": "(Shelly et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 581, "end": 608, "text": "(Wullschleger et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The present study demonstrated that JZ-1 is effective in combating HSV-2 infection, and the potential mechanism is associated with inducing autophagy through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
