            "text": "areas. An earlier study using a GFP-expressing Escherichia coli (GFP-E. coli) as a model 23 organism demonstrated dispersal from drain biofilm in contaminated sinks. The present study 24 further characterizes the dispersal of microorganisms from contaminated sinks. Replicate hand-25 washing sinks were inoculated with GFP-E. coli, and dispersion was measured using qualitative 26 (settle plates) and quantitative (air sampling) methods. Dispersal caused by faucet water was 27 captured with settle plates and air sampling methods when bacteria were present on the drain. In 28 contrast, no dispersal was captured without or in between faucet events amending earlier theory 29 that bacteria aerosolize from P-trap and disperse. Numbers of dispersed GFP-E. coli diminished 30 substantially within 30 minutes after faucet usage, suggesting that the organisms were associated 31 with larger droplet-sized particles that are not suspended in the air for long periods. Retrospective and prospective surveillance investigations affirm that hospital sinks provide 48 habitats for several opportunistic pathogens, raising serious concerns (8, 24, 26, 28) . It is not the 49 mere presence of these drug-resistant pathogens in the hospital wastewater that is of concern, but 50 the ability of these organisms to colonize biofilms on the luminal surfaces of wastewater 51 plumbing and thereby withstand routine cleaning practices. While several gammaproteobacteria 52 detected from the sinks in hospitals have been linked to healthcare-associated infections, 53 opportunistic pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and 54 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are typically known to be found in water environments (29) (30) (31) . In 55 contrast, emerging pathogens such as the carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, many 56 having fecal origin, may survive within the biofilm formed on sink surfaces and wastewater 57 premise plumbing(32, 33). Often by acquiring mobile resistance elements through horizontal 58 gene transfer, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) infections are especially 59 threatening because they are more frequent causes of highly antibiotic resistant infections with 60 reduced treatment options.",

Using a model of sink 66 colonization with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli (GFP-E.coli), we 67 recently demonstrated the source and the degree of dispersion from sink wastewater to the 68 surrounding environment(34).

Clarity regarding 78 aerosol versus droplet mediated dispersion in the context of sinks is critical. In the present study, 79 we aim to further define several outstanding knowledge gaps: i) dispersion mechanism of 80 bacteria, aerosol sized particles or droplets, from biofilms in handwashing sinks, ii) factors 81 triggering dispersion from a colonized sink drain and iii) role of biologically active aerosols 82 spontaneously dispersing from drain or P-trap without a triggering event. GFP-E. coli as the 83 surrogate organism for Enterobacteriaceae was used in this model study to investigate these 84 questions. E.coli (10 9 CFU/ml) was added into the P-trap water (~150ml) through the lower-most sampling 109 port on the tailpiece using a 60ml syringe attached to silicone tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, 110 6 IL). The inoculum was mixed with the P-trap water by repeated withdrawal and injection of the 111 inoculum, with precautions taken to avoid unintentional inoculation of drain (strainer) or sink 112 bowl (bowl). For the drain inoculation, a 10ml mid-log phase culture of GFP-E.coli (10 9 113 CFU/ml) was evenly applied on the surface of the drain using a sterile pipet. For establishment 114 of GFP-E.coli P-trap biofilm, a 10 ml mid-log phase culture of GFP-E.coli (10 9 CFU/ml) was 115 added into an unused P-trap and following inoculation, 25ml TSB and 25ml (x2) 0.85% saline 116 was added on a daily basis through the drain for 7 days to facilitate biofilm growth on the bowl (set at 6L/min for 50min) to collect a 300L air sample (Fig 2b) . In a biological safety 172 cabinet, the liquid from the impinger was transferred to a sterile tube, vortexed, filtered through plates were processed and counted at University of Virginia. Paired with air sampling particles in 179 size range 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 \u00b5m were measured using particle counter (GT-526, Met 180 One Instruments, Inc. Grants Pass, OR) placed 12 inches from the sink bowl (Fig 2. ). With a 181 runtime of 660 seconds each, 3 successive runs of particle counter were performed, first run 182 coinciding with t=0. Particle counter also recorded relative humidity and air temperature. water, plugged, and shipped by overnight courier to CDC for analysis. Swab sampling from the 203 tailpipe and P-trap, and sponge wipes were processed as already described to recover and 204 quantify biofilm organisms. Samples were plated on TSA and R2A media, and counted, as (Table 1) . So were the water and air temperatures ( Table 2 ). In comparison, the relative humidity (Table 2) . Dispersion detected by settle plates across the three sinks ranged from 35-107 CFU/plate. GFP-220 E.coli levels were higher on the counter space surrounding the sink bowl compared to lower 221 counts near the faucets (Fig 4b) . Dispersion was not detected on side-splatter shields. With the 222 exception of the detection of 1 CFU/m 3 at t=60 min using the impaction, dispersion of GFP-E. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mechanism of bacterial dispersion 264 from handwashing sinks, using a GFP plasmid-containing E. coli strain as a surrogate for assessed using a gravity method, and bioaerosol production was not evaluated.",

However, under favorable conditions bacteria can grow or mobilize from the 303 P-trap into the drain piping (tailpiece) and colonize the sink drain surfaces, with the potential for 304 a dispersion event to occur. This further underlines the importance of sanitary hygiene practices, 305 strategic surveillance paired with hand washing only use of hand-washing sinks in the patient 306 care environment to reduce the risk of hand-washing sink contamination by the multi-drug-307 resistant microorganisms that can colonize ICU patients(8).

Settle plates were 320 found to be a reliable method to assess the large-droplet dispersion from sinks. In this study 22 321 settle plates (=11.24 m 2 ) were used which accounted for a defined surface area and locations on 322 the sink counter. Dispersion could have been higher in locations of the sink counter other than 323 those chosen in the present study, and the dispersion load recorded in this study may not be the 324 absolute value. Of the three methods investigated for air sampling, impaction and filtration were 325 found to be reliable and consistent.

This rationale behind testing mannequin hands was to 330 simulate hand washing, but in reality the water would be flowing before, after and during a hand 331 washing event. In other words, an actual handwashing event is more dynamic than static 332 mannequin hands and there is likely direct impact of water on the sink drain at least for brief 333 periods when the water is running. There is also the scenario where the sinks and faucets may be 334 used outside of hand washing (e.g. dumping liquid wastes) (5, 8, 23) . This finding we think 335 further defines and supports another important dynamic that may minimize dispersion in 336 healthcare settings (i.e., avoid faucet water flow directly onto drains to minimize dispersion). All 337 of these findings must be taken in the context of an experimental water stream which directly hits 338 the drain which is outside FGI guidance but thought to be frequently found in health care sink 339 design.",

Each dispersion experiment lasted at least 12h, therefore it was not 342 possible to maintain precisely the same conditions with regards to air flow velocity, air 343 temperature, relative humidity, and bacterial and/or fungal burden in the laboratory space 344 harboring the sinks. These parameters may have direct or indirect influence on the dispersion 345 pattern and load recorded across experiments(47). To address this issue, we monitored the 346 heterotrophic plate counts, relative humidity and particle concentration in the air. Particle counts 347 recorded in the absence of faucet event (control) were higher or equal to that in the presence of 348 faucet event (test). This observation implies that particle concentrations in the air were driven by 349 relative humidity and/or temperature of the air. This trend was observed in all the experimental 350 methods (Drain, P-trap inoculation and Drain colonization) (Supplemental Figure S1 ). In other 351 words, particle counts were largely consistent across the day for a given experiment (control 352 preceding test). Further particle counter used in the study could not resolve or measure particles 353 >5\u03bcm, which defined droplet particles. Another limitation was that air samples were collected at 354 only one location relative to the sink bowl, so it is not possible for this data set to define a 355 \"splash zone\" pattern without additional measurements collected from various positions and 356 distance from the source of dispersed organisms. 357 We have provided data to support the position that microorganisms will disperse from 358 contaminated sink bowl and drain surfaces primarily as large droplets that are generated during 359 faucet usage.

With increasing antimicrobial resistance limiting therapeutic 37 options for patients, better understanding of how pathogens disseminate from sink drains is 38 urgently needed. Once this knowledge gap has decreased, interventions can be engineered to 39 decrease or eliminate transmission from hospital sink drains to patients. The current study further 40 defines the mechanisms of transmission for bacteria colonizing sink drains. 41 INTRODUCTION 43 Recent reports have implicated hand-washing sinks as a primary reservoir of antibiotic 44 resistant pathogens within patient-care environments(1-27). Many of these reports have been 45 published since 2016 highlighting the global recognition that biofilms located in and on sinks can 46 have in disseminating clinically important drug resistant gram-negative bacteria(14-27).",

A steel tube discharging the soap was held in a clamp attached to the faucet and positioned 95 directly below the discharge of the faucet water. Water flow rate from the faucet was 8 L/min. In 96 one experiment, mannequin hands (Dianne Practice Hand, D902, Fromm International, Mt. 97 Prospect, IL) attached to a metal rack and positioned between the faucet head and sink drain 98 were used (Figure 1). To facilitate access to the luminal surface of the drain line, sampling ports 99 were drilled along the length of the tailpiece (between the P-trap and the drain), and the trap arm 100 (between the P-trap and the common line).

TSA plates were incubated overnight 120 at 37\u00baC and colony-forming units (CFUs) fluorescing under UV light were enumerated. All 121 preparatory culturing of GFP-E.coli took place in a separate room from the sink gallery to avoid 122 unintentional contamination. 123 Sampling and Enumeration of GFP-E.coli. To monitor the growth of GFP-E.coli within the 124 plumbing, sterile cotton swabs (Covidien\u2122, Mansfield, MA) presoaked in 0.85% sterile saline 125 were inserted through sampling ports and biofilm samples were collected by turning the swab in 126 a circular motion on the inner surface (~20 cm 2 ). Sample swabs were pulse-vortexed in 3ml 127 saline and serial dilutions were plated on TSA. The entire surface area of the drain, faucet 128 aerator, and sink bowl surfaces were sampled using environmental sponge wipes (3M Sponge-129 stick with neutralizing buffer, 3M, St. Paul, MN) using overlapping and multidirectional 130 motions. The sponge-wipes were expressed in 90 ml of Phosphate Buffered Saline containing 131 Tween 80 (0.02%) (PBST) using a Stomacher (400 Circulator (Seward Ltd., UK). The eluate 132 was concentrated by centrifugation and plate counts were performed on TSA and R2A agar 133 7 (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). TSA plates were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 134 48hr and fluorescent CFUs were enumerated; R2A plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 7d and 135 CFUs were counted. 136 Experimental Approach for Dispersion Studies. Each dispersion experiment comprised a 30 s 137 faucet event repeated three times at 60 min intervals (Fig. 2). Each experiment also comprised a 138 control (without faucet events) followed by a test (with faucet events). Three sinks were tested 139 concurrently but staggered by a few minutes, to account for the variability in dispersion driven 140 by faucet water flowrate, air flow dynamics in the room, contact angle and wastewater drainage / 141 water backup rate. 142 Sampling Droplet Dispersion. TSA settle plates were used to capture the droplet dispersion. 143 Numbered TSA plates were laid out radially around the sink bowl. A fixed layout and number of 144 settle plates around the sinks was used for each dispersal experiment (Fig. 3). The counter space 145 of each sink was thoroughly disinfected with Caviwipes-1 (Metrex Research, LLC, Orange, CA) 146 prior to each experiment. TSA plates were then positioned on the sink counter surrounding the 147 sink bowl. Additional plates were attached to the faucets, plexiglass partitions, and faucet 148 handles using adhesive tape. Plates were not placed in the sink bowl. TSA plates were also 149 placed >3 m away from the sink as negative controls. Lids of the TSA plates were removed only 150 for the duration of the dispersal experiment. Dispersion per defined area (CFU/cm 2 ) for settle 151 plates was determined by dividing the CFU counts in the TSA plate by the surface area of the 152 plate.",

Individual sink sampling was staggered by a few minutes to provide time for air 157 sampler installation and sampling of each sink. A control experiment period, in which faucets158    were not activated for the entire 120 minutes was also performed for each sink. Three air 159 sampling methods were tested: impaction, impingement, and filtration. For the impaction160 method, two SAS90 air samplers (Bioscience International, Rockville, MD) containing one TSA 161 plate and one R2A plate each were positioned 12 inches from the sink bowl and set for a 300L 162 sample (at 90L/min for 200 seconds) (Fig. 2a).

Prior to each experiment, 500 mL 193 of first-catch faucet water and a 500 mL sample collected after two minutes of flushing were 194 collected in sterile bottles containing sodium thiosulfate (0.18 g/l) for dechlorination. Samples 195 were plated on TSA and incubated at 35\u00b0C for 48 hours to test for GFP-E.coli in the faucet water 196 supplied to each sink and to ensure cross contamination of GFP-E.coli had not occurred. First-197 catch and two-minute flush samples were diluted and plated on R2A, which were incubated at 198 25\u00b0C for 7 days and counted. After the experiment was completed, samples were collected and 199 processed to detect GFP-E.coli in the sink plumbing.
