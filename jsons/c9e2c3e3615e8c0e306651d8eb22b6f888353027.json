Based on our experience, we focused primarily on strategies related to multidimensional protein identi fi cation technology (MudPIT) approach (Mauri and Scigelova 2009 ) , (Fig. 9 .1 ). In particular, we have explored methods, algorithms, and procedures used for biomarker discovery, by means of label and label-free methods. In this context, we then introduce the main advances of the targeted proteomics (Lange et al. 2008 ) by investigating the bioinformatics aspects concerning the identi fi cation of proteotypic peptides (Craig et al. 2005 ; Kuster et al. 2005 ) . In the second part of the chapter, we discuss recent advances regarding clinical proteomics application for discriminating sample, such as diseased and healthy. Finally, since most known mechanisms leading to disease involve multiple molecules, we conclude with a discussion of the integration of proteomic data with network datasets, as a promising framework for identifying subnetwork that underlines the emergence of speci fi c phenotypes. Fig. 9 .1 Multidimensional protein identi fi cation technology represents a fully automated technology that simultaneously allows separation of digested peptides, their sequencing, and identi fi cation of the corresponding proteins. Peptides are separated by means of strong ion exchange ( SCX ), using steps of increasing salt concentration, followed by C18 reverse phase ( RP ) chromatography, using an acetonitrile gradient. Finally, eluted peptides are directly analyzed by MS and raw spectra processed by speci fi c algorithms and bioinformatics tools (see Supplemental Information Table 1 ). In this way, MudPIT permits simultaneous identi fi cation of hundreds, or even thousands, of proteins without limits related to pI, MW, or hydrophobicity. This huge amount of data represents a rich source of information, and their content may be exploited for discovery and classi fi cation approaches",

Accordingly, quanti fi cation is achieved by measuring the ratio of the signal intensities between the unlabeled peptide and its identical counterpart enriched with isotopes (further details on stable isotope-labeling methods are reported in Supplemental Information ). Absolute measurements of protein concentration may be achieved with spiked synthetic peptides, as in QconCAT (Mirzaei et al. 2008 ) , AQUA (Gerber et al. 2003 ) , SISCAPA (Anderson et al. 2004 ) , VICAT (Lu et al. 2007 ) , and PC-IDMS ( Barnidge et al. 2004 ) . Quanti fi cation is obtained by adding into the sample a known amount of an isotopically labeled peptide. In this way, the level of the endogenous form of peptide can be calculated. Of course, the identity of the peptide must be known prior to analysis by MS. Sometimes, if the m/z ratio of the spiked standard is the same of other peptides, it may lead to an inaccurate quanti fi cation. In this case, the ambiguity of the results may be minimized combining these approaches with the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (Lange et al. 2008 ) .",

As opposite, a simpler alternative concerns label-free approaches (Zhu et al. 2010 ) . They are basically based on counting of peptides identi fi ed by means of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) or by evaluating the signal intensity of peptides. Spectral sampling is directly proportional to the relative abundance of the protein in the mixture and therefore represents an attractive methodology, thanks to their intrinsic simplicity, throughput, and low cost.",

One of the most diffused approaches uses the spectral count (SpC) value (Liu et al. 2004 ) and is based on the empirical observation that more is the quantity of a protein in a sample and more tandem MS spectra may be collected for its peptides. In this context, the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF), or its natural log transformation, has been used for the quantitative evaluation with t-test analysis (Zybailov et al. 2006 ) . Other authors have used the protein abundance index (PAI or emPAI) that is calculated by dividing, for each protein, the number of observed peptides by the number of all possible detectable tryptic peptides (Ishihama et al. 2005 ) , while Zhang and colleagues processed SpC values by means of the statistical G-test as previously described (Zhang et al. 2006 ) .",

For this purpose, the STEPP software contains an implementation of a trained support vector machine (SVM) (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor 2000 ; Vapnik 1999 ) that uses a simple descriptor space, based on 35 properties of amino acid, to compute a score representing how proteotypic a peptide is by LC-MS (Webb-Robertson 2009 ) . Similarly to STEPP, a predictor was developed, called Peptide Sieve (Mallick et al. 2007 ) , by studying physicochemical properties of more than 600,000 peptides identi fi ed by four different proteomic platforms. This predictor has the ability to accurately identify proteotypic peptides from any protein sequence and offer starting points for generating a physical model describing the factors that govern elements of proteomic work fl ows such as digestion, chromatography, ionization, and fragmentation. Other authors, like Tang et al., used neural networks (Riedmiller and Braun 1993 ) to develop the DetectabilityPredictor software that uses 175 amino acid properties (Tang et al. 2006 ) . In the same way, arti fi cial neural networks were used to predict peptides potentially observable for a given set of experimental, instrumental, and analytical conditions concerning multidimensional protein identi fi cation technology datasets (Sanders et al. 2007 ) . Finally, random forest (Breiman 2001 ) was used to develop enhanced signature peptide (ESP) predictor. It was speci fi cally designed for facilitating the development of targeted MS-based assays for biomarker veri fi cation or any application where protein levels need to be measured (Fusaro et al. 2009 ) .",

Inadequate performance could be attributed to different reasons (e.g., insuf fi cient or redundant features, inappropriate model classi fi er, few or too many model parameters, under-or overtraining, and code error, as well as presence of highly nonlinear relationships, noise, and systematic bias). Thus, with the purpose of testing the adequacy/inadequacy of a classi fi er, after learning is completed, its performances are evaluated through validation set, previously unseen. For this purpose, various methods, such as k -fold cross-validation, bootstrapping, and holdout methods, have been used (Ressom et al. 2008 ) . The most common performance measures to evaluate the performances of classi fi ers are a confusion matrix and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The fi rst one shows information about actual and predicted classi fi cations of a classi fi er and assesses its performances using standard indices, such as sensitivity, speci fi city, PPV, NPV, and accuracy values (see Supplemental Information ). On the other hand, ROC is a plot of the sensitivity of a classi fi er against 1-speci fi city for multiple decision thresholds.",

Before the advent of -omics technologies, reductionism has dominated the biological research for over a century by investigating individual cellular components. Despite its enormous success, it is more and more evident that most molecular functions occur from a concerted action of multiple molecules, and their investigation implies the examination of an ensemble of elements (Barab\u00e1si and Oltvai 2004 ) . In fact, biomolecular interactions play a role in the majority of cellular processes that are regulated connecting numerous constituents, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. Data abstraction in pathways or networks is the natural result of the desire to rationalize knowledge of complex systems. More recently, their use has changed from purely illustrative to an analytic purpose. In fact, even if it is purely virtual and not related to any intrinsic structure in the cell or organism, understanding how, where, and when single components interact is fundamental to facilitate the investigation of experimental data by taking into consideration the functional relationship among molecules.",

Thanks to this relevant amount of data, researchers are characterizing the discovery processes by integrating large set of experimental data into models used to generate hypothesis for testing. For this purpose, systems biology approaches provide a powerful strategy for linking biomarker expression with biological processes that can be segmented and linked to disease presentation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is emerging also as a powerful approach suitable to face clinical questions. Even if it is an area of still unrealized potential, clinical proteomics offers the promise of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic follow-up of human diseases. However, given the current status of measurement reproducibility and lack of standardization, further comparative investigations are of great importance.",

In particular, the relevant amount of data produced by the high-throughput proteomics technologies require powerful informatics supports for their organization and interpretation. In this context, several topics concerning data storage, their processing, their visualization, and their interpretation have been faced. However, the need of standards is considered fundamental, and some projects for sharing experimental data between research groups have been launched (e.g., MIAPE, CDISC, and HL7). These should increase meta-analysis, by using raw data from different centers, for helping the development that was grossly underestimated in the initial studies. In addition, as a proteomics community, we believe proteomics methodologies mature for tackling future challenges in clinical proteomics. However, the production of valuable data should rise in step with cooperation with medically focused groups. ",

They include isotope-coded af fi nity tags (ICAT), where free cysteine residues are tagged by a reagent containing eight or zero deuterium atoms (Gygi et al. 1999 ) . Tags are linked to the biotin which may be exploited for enriching the labeled peptides using af fi nity puri fi cation prior to MS analysis. Although this strategy reduces the complexity of the peptide mixture, proteins that do not contain cysteine are excluded from the analysis. For this reason, other approaches use reactive residues that occur more frequently in proteins. At this class belong the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) (Ross et al. 2004 ) , the tandem mass tags (TMT) (Thompson et al. 1999 ) , and the isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) . In particular, iTRAQ approach is widely used and it is based on the covalent labeling of the N-terminus and side chain amines of peptides. Multiplexing tagging allows the analysis of up to 8 samples per experiment (Choe et al. 2007 ) . In fact, samples differently tagged are pooled and usually fractionated by LC and analyzed by MS/MS. However, problem of co-elution of peptides with similar mass could interfere with the quanti fi cation. Finally, as for enzymatic tagging of peptides, recently trypsin-catalyzed 18 O labeling has grown in popularity due to its simplicity, its cost, and its ability to universally label peptides. Both C-terminal carboxyl group atoms of tryptic peptides can be enzymatically exchanged with 18 O providing a labeled peptide with a 4-Da mass shift from the 16 O-labeled sample (Qian et al. 2011 ) .",

He has been involved in the study of the bioavailability of several drugs in humans and animals.He has set up a proteomics laboratory based on both traditional proteomic technologies (2D gel and off-line identi fi cation LC-MS/MS) and innovative approaches. In particular, he is among the fi rst Italian researchers to use the MudPIT methodology (2DC-MS/MS) and a parallel computing system for proteomics. The latter instrumentation allows for the proteomic pro fi ling of biological samples, without limitations, according to protein molecular weight, pI, or hydrophobicity, and guarantees high productivity. Using this methodology, secreted proteins from tumor ( FASEB 2005) and immune system cells have been characterized. Furthermore, direct analysis of biological samples ( JMS 2007) , enzymatic complexes ( Biochimie 2006), development of novel methodological approaches for studying switch-redox proteins ( JBC 2005 , JMB 2006 , and structural and functional characterization of proteins ( Biol. Chem. 2004 , FEBS 2006 have been performed.In addition, he has developed analytical methods for qualiquantitative characterization of natural bioactive compounds (such as polyphenols and terpenes from Ginkgo biloba and other medicinal plants), and bioavailability studies in human and animals have been performed. He is coauthor of more than 100 scienti fi c publications; he has participated in numerous international congresses and has taught in several metabolomic and proteomic courses.",
