The procaryotic GST-ORF3 recombinant fusion protein was used to raise a monospecific antiserum in rabbits. By Western-immunoblotting with PRRSV-infected cell extracts, the ORF3 encoded protein had an estimated molecular mass (M r ) of 42 kDa, similar to that of the protein expressed by the adenovirus vector. Endoglycosidase F digestion showed that the ORF3 encoded protein occurs in an highly glycosylated form (GP 3 ) in the infected MARC-145 cells. Pulse-chase and radioimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the GP 3 protein was present in amounts equivalent to those of the N, M, and GP 5 proteins in the infected cells, whereas no GP 3 could be detected in purified virions. During the first 30 min of chase, the GP 3 undergoes a gradual downward shift of its apparent M r , thought to result from trimming of the mannose-rich glycan structures. Tested convalescent pig sera that were found to be seropositive to PRRSV by indirect immunofluorescence reacted positively with the recombinant GST-ORF3 fusion protein by immunoblotting. Data indicated that the ORF3 protein of the Quebec reference strain of PRRSV is a highly glycosylated and antigenic protein, which is nonstructural.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is responsible for reproductive failure in sows and gilts (late-term abortions, increased numbers of stillborns, mummified and weak-born pigs), and respiratory problems in pigs of all ages [12] . PRRSV is a member of a new group of small enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses, presently classified within the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) [3, 6] . The viral genome is approximately 15 Kb in length and contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) which are transcribed in the cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs [25, 26] . The major structural proteins consist of a 25 kDa envelope glycoprotein (GP 5 ), an 18-19 kDa unglycosylated membrane protein (M), and a 15 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively [21, 22, 27] . Recent findings on characterization of the structural proteins of Lelystad virus (LV), the European prototype strain of PRRSV, indicate that expression products of the ORFs 2 and 4 are also incorporated in virus particles as additional minor membrane-associated glycoproteins designated as GP 2 and GP 4 , respectively [28, 35] . The ORF3 product of LV has been also characterized as a highly glycosylated structural protein (GP 3 ) of the virion [35, 37] . However, it is noteworthy that i) the ORF3 product of LDV has been recently characterized as a nonstructural protein [8] , and that ii) the ORF3 of North American strains of PRRSV has been reported to encode for a highly glycosylated protein (6 potential-linked glycosylated sites) that presents less than 55% amino acid (aa) sequence identity with that of its European counterpart and lacks at least 10 aa residues at its C-terminal region [16, 21] . The latter region of the GP 3 is hypervariable and carries epitopes responsible for antigenic differences between European and North American strains [7, 16] . Further, there is no evidence that the homologous protein of EAV is structural [6] .",

Following cloning of the enzymatically amplified ORF3 in the pGEX-4T-1 vector, a recombinant ORF3 protein fused to GST (GST-ORF3) was synthesized by transformed E. coli cells. The latter accumulated within the cells in the form of inclusion bodies, which could be solubilized in the presence of lysosyme, Triton X-100 and 8M urea, then separated by SDS-PAGE. The electroeluted GST-ORF3 was tested by Western immunoblotting for its reactivity with serum of a pig that has been experimentally-infected with the homologous IAF-Klop strain [19] . A protein with an approximate M r of 52.3 kDa was revealed (data not shown), in agreement with the M r of the ORF3 product estimated from the aa sequence (26.3 kDa) in addition to the M r of GST which is about 26 kDa. Using acetone-fixed MARC-145 cells that have been infected with the autologous virus, IIF antibody titer of 1:1024 was determined for the rabbit \u24233 monospecific antiserum. However, this antiserum failed to neutralize CPE induced in MARC-145 cells by 100 TCID 50 of the virus. When reacted by Western immunoblotting with proteins of the concentrated crude viral preparation (contaminated by cellular proteins), the \u24233 monospecific antiserum specifically recognized a 42 kDa protein (Fig. 1C , lane 1), which was also weakly recognized by the autologous anti-PRRSV pig (Fig. 1A, lane 1) , but not by the pre-immune rabbit and pig sera (data not shown). As expected, the autologous anti-PRRSV pig serum also revealed the three major structural proteins of PRRSV, N, M and GP 5 from the crude viral preparation (Fig. 1A, lane 1) , their identity being confirmed using a pool of the \u24235, \u24236 and \u24237 monospecific antisera (Fig. 1B, lane 1) .",

As the protein expressed by the recombinant adenovirus displayed exactly the same electrophoretic profile (Fig. 1A and 1C, lanes 3) , it can be assumed that the overall glycosylation process of the recombinant protein in 293 cells is very similar to that occurring in MARC-145 cells.",

At 0 min of chase (following pulse), the three major viral proteins N, M and GP 5 were efficiently precipitated from infected cell lysates and migrated in the gel with the expected mobility. The ORF3 product was first detected in the infected cell lysates as a major band of 42 kDa which underwent a gradual decrease to a 39 to 40 kDa protein by the end of the 240 min-chase period. At that time, most of the GP 3 has been lost from the cells, but there was also a decrease in the amounts of other proteins that co-precipitated, namely a protein with an approximated M r of 30 kDa which was also detected throughout the 240 min-chase period. In further experiments, this additional intracellular protein was identified as GP 4 on the basis of its reactivity with a rabbit monospecific anti-GST-ORF4 serum [10] . On the other hand, when RIPA was performed with the concentrated extracellular virions (Fig. 4A, medium) of chased cells, N, M and GP 5 , but not the 39 to 42 kDa protein, were obviously precipitated all together after 60 min, and increased as the chase period continued.

To confirm the validity of the above findings, extracellular virus was highly purified, and only the most infectious fraction of the isopycnic CsCl density gradient was used for immunoprecipitation. Since GP 3 could not be detected immunologically from highly purified and concentrated virus (Fig. 4B ), but only from concentrated crude viral preparations contaminated by cellular membranes, we postulated that GP 3 of PRRSV is most probably a non-structural glycoprotein, as recently reported for the ORF3 encoded protein of LDV [8] . This finding is in contrast to previous conclusion by others that the GP 3 of the reference European strain LV of PRRSV is another putative envelope glycoprotein of the virion. The data obtained were unexpected since the ORF3 proteins of all the arteriviruses possess similar structure, notably the lack of a potential transmembrane segment, except for a signal peptide [8, 34] . Although the overall charges of the N-terminal region of the GP 3 of LV and IAF-Klop strains are different, they possess the same number of hydrophobic peaks [21] . Since sequence analyses did not reveal notable differences in the aa sequences of the GP 3 of the IAF-Klop strain, the discrepancy noted with the LV strain is most probably due to the procedure used in the present study to avoid contamination of purified viral preparation with cellular membranes to which may be associated envelope viral glycoproteins. One may hypothesize that failure of the \u24233 monospecific antiserum to precipitate GP 3 from purified extracellular virions is possible because the latter was raised using an unglycosylated E. coli expression product, but this is unlikely since pulse chase experiments demonstrated that it precipitated efficiently GP 3 from PRRSV-infected cell lysates despite modifications of its sugar residues. This antiserum also immunoprecipitated the GP 3 expressed by the recombinant adenovirus and the nonglycosylated product (P3) obtained following treatment of PRRSV-infected cell lysates with glyco F, an enzyme mixture which hydrolyzes N-glycans of the high mannose-and complex-type. The P3 protein displayed a molecular mass of approximately 27 kDa, consistent with that predicted from the aa sequence of the ORF3 apoprotein [21] .",

Although a serological survey using an unglycosylated E. coli expression product is relatively meaningless, data obtained indicate that GP 3 contains linear antigenic determinants, which are independent of the glycosylation process that trigger the immune system of PRRSVinfected pigs to produce specific antibodies. On the other hand, the monospecific \u24233 antiserum raised in rabbits was not neutralizing, in agreement with previous findings by others on the biological activities of anti-GP3 monoclonal antibodies to the Lelystad virus [7] , and the demonstration that the carboxyterminal portion of PRRSV ORF3 encodes a non-neutralizing peptide [16] . This is also consistent with the fact that antibody titers of naturally-infected pigs to GP 3 , as determined by ELISA using E. coli-expressed recombinant GST-ORF3 fusion protein as antigen, seemed not to correlate with neutralization titers [11] . At present, only antibodies to either the GP 4 or the GP 5 of PRRSV have been described as neutralizing [29, 30] . In view of recent findings by other that baculovirus-expressed ORF3 protein may confer partial protection in pregnant sows against reproductive disorders [31] in the absence of a noticeable neutralizing humoral response, the exact role of anti-GP 3 antibody response and the role of GP 3 in the induction of a cellular immunity remain to be determined.",

            "text": "Even if the exact roles and functions of the ORF3 product of Arteriviruses are still to be determined, it is noteworthy that i) the ORF 3 product of EAV has not been characterized as a structural protein [34] , and ii) a recent report indicates that the LDV ORF3 protein is a highly glycosylated, nonstructural protein that most likely is produced in a soluble and membrane-bound glycoprotein that elicits a strong antibody response in infected mice [8] , properties that seem to be shared by the GP 3 of North American strains of PRRSV. Such findings have been already described for few positive-stranded RNA viruses. In the case of Flaviviruses, the NS1 proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus [5] and Dengue virus [32] are known as secreted non-structural proteins that are highly glycosylated and antigenic, and able to induce protective immunity [33] . Furthermore, the membrane-associated E3 protein of Sindbis virus, a member of the Alphavirus genus, is also another example of a nonstructural, soluble glycoprotein encoded by an RNA virus [36] . In pulse-chase experiments, an intracellular reduction of GP 3 of the IAF-Klop strain was observed during the 240 min chase period which may suggest loss of cellular integrity (due to CPE) or release from the cells in soluble form into the medium. At the time when the pulse-chase experiments were performed (24 h post-infection), trypan blue staining of PRRSV-infected cell monolayers revealed not more than 1 to 2% of cell death, a level which was similar to that obtained with mock-infected cells (data not shown). This finding ruled out the possibility that the loss of ORF3 protein during the 240-min chase period was due to intensive cell damages. Data obtained from recent studies on the intracellular processing and fates of the GP 3 expressed by the AdCMV5/ORF3 virus substantiated the hypothesis that the GP 3 must be released from the infected cells in a soluble form [23] .",
