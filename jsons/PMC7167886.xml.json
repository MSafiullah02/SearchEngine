A retrospective cohort study evaluating 75 children with CF had similar challenges with sample size with RSV hospitalizations in 3 out of 35 palivizumab recipients and 7 out of 40 non\u2010recipients.18 Results of a survey ascertaining utilization pattern of palivizumab in CF reported that 14 out of 143 infants with CF received palivizumab across responding CF centers.19 One of the palivizumab users versus 15 of the 129 non\u2010users had been hospitalized due to RSV. Finally, one study20 compared 91 CF infants receiving palivizumab in the Palivizumab Outcomes Registry with two historical cohorts.10, 11 With none of the prophylaxed CF infants hospitalized as a result of RSV, the authors concluded that palivizumab has significantly reduced RSV\u2010caused hospitalizations.

To place the observed incidence rates into context, we found an age\u2010adjusted incidence rate of 2.1 RSV hospitalizations per 1,000 season months (1.5% per season assuming 5 season months) across all 0\u20132\u2010year\u2010old children, compared to 4.5 RSV hospitalizations in children with diagnosed CF (2.3% per season), and 9.7 for children who met the palivizumab indication for CHD (11.4 when adjusted for palivizumab exposure using the clinical trial efficacy estimate, equating to 5.7% per season). Published RSV hospitalization incidence estimates from prospective CF cohorts range from 8.8% per 2\u2010year follow\u2010up (approximately 4.4% per season)10 to 10% per season (estimated based on three events).9 The key palivizumab efficacy trial reported incidence rates of 16 and 26 per 1,000 season months for the placebo group with prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, much higher than any report in CF patients.5 Of note, the protocol of the clinical trial and the prospective CF cohorts assured testing for RSV when children were hospitalized with respiratory problems, while standard clinical practice may not always test for RSV and thus assign non\u2010pathogen\u2010specific diagnoses, resulting in lower RSV incidence rates.

The analysis of ARI\u2010related outcomes suggested no or little effect of palivizumab immunoprophylaxis. Of note, the study was powered sufficiently to allow detection of a 55% reduction in ARI\u2010hospitalization incidence, similar to palivizumab efficacy estimates in clinical trials of other high\u2010risk patients (alpha = 5%, power = 80%). One could argue that little effect might be expected considering the composite nature of our endpoint, including infections that would be unaffected by palivizumab prophylaxis. Interestingly, the unadjusted incidence estimates for RSV\u2010hospitalization for palivizumab exposure were smaller than those for unexposed periods, while this relationship was reversed for ARI\u2010hospitalizations. Thus, palivizumab users were sicker with respect to a greater propensity for respiratory problems, which, however, did not seem to be true for RSV\u2010hospitalizations, further supporting a potentially beneficial effect of immunoprophylaxis.",

It should be noted that the lung epithelia in patients with CF are normal at birth and decline over time, which might support the notion that patients with CF in infancy have similar RSV risk than healthy children.8 Conversely, it has been shown that RSV can serve as a coupling agent between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the lung epithelia suggesting a possible role for the increased risk of early acquisition of P. aeruginosa infections in early infancy.25\n",
