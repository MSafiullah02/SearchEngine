It is particularly distressing that outbreaks of infection have developed rapidly in many nursing homes, where staff have been completely neglected by health authorities and can offer only little protection to many frail and needy older people.",

At the first crisis, the system thus met with serious difficulties. Today is time only to reduce the suffering of the present; at the end of the drama, planning the functioning of nursing homes in a different way must be essential.",

Loneliness, therefore, is the general condition in these nursing homes, where nobody enters and nobody exits. The prevailing feeling is that of living in a trap, in a generally modern residence, where everything happens in the most complete closure, to defend those who are inside from the risk of contagion and those who are outside from the possibility of witnessing the progressive, unavoidable, and unmodifiable shutdown of many lives.",

An attempt has been made to replace direct contacts with the use of tablet computers. However, this provision has limited effectiveness on residents with dementia, who need a caress, a massage, and a nearby voice. In many cases, this attempt has caused serious discomfort, which manifests itself as delirium superimposed on dementia, in particular a hypokinetic type, with the consequent refusal of food and the difficulty of getting out of bed.2 We are not yet able to measure the frequency of these reactions, but empirical observation indicates a prevalence of over 50% of the residents.3 Older residents who are cognitively intact also breathe the atmosphere of anxiety and anguish, even if staff try not to convey their worries and fears.",

One relative told us, \u201cif I had not put my dad in the nursing home, he would still be with me and in these dramatic moments I could make him understand all my affection\u201d. In others, aggression towards nursing home managers arises. All are dominated by fear and anguish because the messages filtered by the staff regarding the condition of their loved ones do not eliminate anxieties for the future. This feeling is aggravated by television and newspaper reports that residents cannot be transferred to emergency hospital facilities because these are too overcrowded. Family members feel like they are left outside the walls of a castle, without knowing anything about what is going on inside.",

Doctors feel exhausted and unable to make good clinical predictions: some patients seem to be seriously ill and recover, whereas others appear to be fine then die.

Moreover, every time a resident dies, a bond that has been built in months of closeness gets broken; this loss causes a pain that most of the time cannot be shared with anyone because the numbers of staff on duty have decreased because of contamination with the virus. Psychological support services for staff have been abolished during the epidemic. In some cases, staff have been provided accommodation that is separate from those of their families, which creates an additional castle effect, provoking, in turn, complex dynamics between care team members, who frequently lack effective leadership.",

This lack of connectivity is unprecedented. Dead people disappear without any contact with those who previously knew them and loved them. Because there is no more room in the local cemeteries and no cremation can be done nearby, military trucks have transported the coffins of dead people to other regions. Television pictures of these scenes have made a huge impression on all Italian citizens. From the besieged castles desperate appeals for help frequently emerge. Overwhelmed by the magnitude of the catastrophe or unable to find adequate answers, nobody answers.",
