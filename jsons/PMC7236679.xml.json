In response to this situation, between March 9th and 13th there was a progressive closure of schools and universities. On March 14th, the Spanish government declared a nationwide state of alert and population lockdown was imposed as of March 16th. For many Spaniards, this is the first experience of an emergency with an imperceptible agent, leading to great uncertainty and significant adverse consequences for mental health (Hawryluck et al., 2004; Shigemura et al., 2020).",

For instance, in a recent study focusing on Chinese medical college students, higher levels of anxiety were associated with factors strongly related to COVID-19, such as acquaintance with a COVID-19 diagnosed patient (Cao et al., 2020). Likewise, data from international students have shown an increase in concerns not only for their education, but also for the well-being of their families in case of their return home because of suspended in-person classes (Zhai and Du, 2020).",

Longitudinal studies are needed to analyze the long-term impact of this situation on the psychological state of their members and to draw conclusions about the cause and effect relationships between the variables involved. Secondly, we adopted a convenient online survey in only one university from Spain, which may contribute to some bias in the study results. Larger scale surveys in different universities should be conducted in order to extend and generalize the findings. Thirdly, our results indicate the need of incorporating additional aspects in future studies. For example, it is important to explore why younger students are suffering a greater psychological impact, which could be related to factors such as their perception of the future, their way of consuming information media, etc.",

Students from the SS&L and A&H fields were more affected than students from other areas, particularly with respect to E&A students. This study suggests that mental health from university students and employees should be carefully monitored during this crisis, and that universities should provide psychological services oriented and adapted to these circumstances to mitigate the emotional impact on university members.",
