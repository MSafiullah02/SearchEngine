Each stage of the cell cycle is regulated and controlled by both positive and negative regulators, for example cyclins and their partner molecules, the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and associated inhibitor complexes (CDKIs) [3]. Many viruses interact with the cell cycle to promote favourable conditions for virus infection and for disrupting host cell proliferation and function [4]. However, the alteration of the host cell cycle by RNA viruses has not been described as extensively when compared to DNA or retroviruses.",

Infection of cells with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a G2/M phase arrest [6], with changes in the amounts of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as a reduction in cyclin D1 [6]. In the case of the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infection results in an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle with a resulting decrease in the D\u2010type cyclins [7]. Over\u2010expression studies indicated that a component of the viral replicase could arrest cells in this phase of the cell cycle [8]. On the other hand, in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus hepatocytes have been reported to accumulate in mitosis [9] and this is in contrast to a number of SARS\u2010coronavirus proteins that when over expressed lead to an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle [10, 11]. For example, the SARS\u2010coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein has been reported to block S phase progression [12] and prolong the G0/G1 phase and shorten the S phase [13]. Likewise, when over expressed the IBV N protein delays cell growth and results in aberrant cytokinesis [14, 15], which is also observed in infected cells [6, 15].",

Like all cyclins, levels of cyclin D1 fluctuate depending on the particular stage of the cell cycle, with levels of cyclin D1 accumulating in the G1 phase. Cyclin D1 is then rapidly degraded via the cellular proteosome during S phase allowing DNA synthesis to occur [16]. Levels then begin to rise again during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Regulation of cyclin D1 expression is controlled by the abundance of cyclin D1 mRNA, sub\u2010localisation and degradation [17]. In this study the reduction of cyclin D1 was investigated in IBV infected cells.",

Cyclin D1 levels then begin to rise again in the G2/M phase. Therefore, we investigated the effect on cyclin D1 mRNA and protein in IBV\u2010infected cells which had been enriched at either the G1/S or G2/M phase border. Vero cells were enriched in these phases using, either a double thymidine block or nocodazole treatment [6]. After treatment, cell cycle profiles were determined using dual flow cytometry and the data indicated that the cells had been enriched at the G1/S or G2/M phase border (Figs. 3\nA and 4\nA, respectively). For double thymidine treated cells there were an average of 88% of cells in the G1 phase, 3% in S phase and 9% in the G2/M phase, and in cells treated with nocodazole, there were an average of 20% of cells in G1, 23% in S phase and 57% in the G2/M phase, as described previously [6]. The cells were then simultaneously released and treated with either UV\u2010inactivated virus or infected with IBV and the levels of cyclin D1 protein (determined by Western blot) and mRNA (determined by TaqMan as per above) compared to that of mock\u2010infected cells at 24 h post\u2010infection and release. The data indicated that the amount of cyclin D1 protein was reduced in IBV\u2010infected cells compared to mock\u2010infected or UV\u2010inactivated virus treated cells for both cell cycle conditions (Figs. 3B and 4B). There was no significant difference in the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA for both conditions (Figs. 3C and 4C). This mirrored the observations of cyclin D1 protein and mRNA in asynchronously growing and G0 enriched Vero cells, and indicated that reduction in cyclin D1 levels by IBV was not dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of infection. Interestingly, in the cells enriched in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle whilst the amount of cyclin D1 protein was greater in mock\u2010infected cells at 24 h post\u2010infection compared to 0 h, in infected cells the amount of cyclin D1 remained unchanged compared to that at 0 h. This result could be attributed to the fact that in uninfected cycling cells cyclin D1 is rapidly degraded in S phase and then increases again in the G2 phase [31], whereas IBV arrests cells in the early G2 phase of the cell cycle [6] and therefore cyclin D1 levels may not have started to increase.",

To test whether this was the case in IBV\u2010infected cells, mock and infected cells were treated with the CRM\u20101 inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB). To confirm that the LMB treatment was active in these experiments, an RNA export assay was used based on the export of HIV\u20101 REV that utilizes the CRM1 pathway [19]. A luciferase gene was placed within an inefficiently spliced intron that contained the REV response element (creating plasmid pLUCSALRRE). The pre\u2010mRNA is normally retained in the nucleus and the exported, spliced mRNA lacks the luciferase gene. Export is facilitated through co\u2010expressing HIV\u20101 Rev protein under the control of a CMV promoter (plasmid pRev), which ensures that the pre\u2010mRNA is actively exported through the CRM1 pathway and luciferase activity would therefore be detected. The presence of LMB would inhibit the REV\u2010dependent mRNA export, confirming that LMB treatment of cells was effectively blocking the CRM1\u2010dependent export pathway. Therefore, in order to assess the activity of LMB Vero cells were transfected with pLUCSALRRE with or without LMB and also in the absence and presence of pRev (Fig. 7\nA). The data indicated that in the absence of pRev there was no significant difference in luciferase activity between LMB treated or untreated cells, and this level was taken as background activity. In contrast, when the pRev protein was present, the level of luciferase was 70% less in LMB treated cells compared to untreated cells, indicating that LMB reduced CRM1\u2010mediated export.",

This inhibitor has been used to investigate ubiquitin mediated degradation of cyclin D1 in coxsackie virus infected cells [38]. Western blot analysis was used to detect cyclin D1, GAPDH and IBV proteins. The data indicated more cyclin D1 protein in MG132 treated cells compared to untreated (Fig. 8\nA), which was confirmed by immunofluoresence analysis of both mock and infected cells in the presence and absence of MG132 (Fig. 8B).

One candidate viral protein, could be the IBV N protein which can traffic between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm [22, 26] and interactions with the nucleolus and its proteins may be one mechanism by which RNA viruses can disrupt the cell cycle [39]. IBV N protein is a phospho\u2010protein which binds RNA with high affinity [40, 41]. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), N protein has been shown to interact with cyclin D1 in cells expressing N protein [12]. To investigate whether IBV N protein could interact with cyclin D1 co\u2010localisation studies using confocal microscopy and pull down studies were performed. However, no co\u2010localisation was observed in cells expressing IBV N protein tagged to the fluorescent fusion protein, EGFP (Fig. 10\nA). This may have been due to the fact that IBV N protein localises principally to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, rather than the nucleus [26, 42], which is in contrast to cyclin D1 which is predominately nuclear, therefore the two molecules could not interact. To test this hypothesis a mutant EGFP\u2010tagged N protein was used in which the nuclear export signal had been deleted and whose localisation was nuclear and nucleolar [26]. However, no co\u2010localisation was observed (Fig. 10B). Likewise, cyclin D1 was tagged N\u2010terminally with ECFP, which resulted in the accumulation of the fusion protein predominately in the cytoplasm. Transfection of cells with this plasmid and also expressing EGFP\u2010IBV N protein indicated that no co\u2010localisation was observed between these two proteins in the cytoplasm (Fig. 10C).",
