            "text": "During recent decades, porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) infection has become of major economic importance to the pig industry. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that the presence of PCV-2 can be traced back to 1962 in Germany (Jacobsen et al., 2009) and since then the number of diseases associated with this infection has rapidly expanded (Carman et al., 2006, Opriessnig et al., 2007). In addition to post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephritis syndrome (PDNS), PCV-2 infection has been associated with proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (Chae, 2005), cerebellar vasculitis (Seeliger et al., 2007), granulomatous enteritis (Chae, 2005), reproductive failure with abortion and premature farrowing (West et al., 1999, Allan and Ellis, 2000, Park et al., 2005) and neonatal losses with tremor (Stevenson et al., 2001) or myocarditis (West et al., 1999, Mikami et al., 2005). Pigs infected with PCV-2 often develop concurrent infections with agents such as porcine parvovirus (PPV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Morin et al., 1990, Ellis et al., 1999, Larochelle et al., 1999, Harms et al., 2001), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV; Harms et al., 2001), Aujezsky's disease virus (Rodriquez-Arrioja et al., 1999), Chlamydophila (Carrasco et al., 2000) or fungi such as Pneumocystis carinii (Clark, 1997).",

It is recognized as the third leading cause of death caused by food-borne diseases in people in the USA (Jones et al., 2001). Among meat producing animals, pigs are considered to be the most important source of human infection with Toxoplasma gondii in the USA (Dubey, 1986). In most porcine cases, infection with T. gondii is subclinical, while systemic toxoplasmosis has been reported only rarely in pigs (Weissenb\u00f6ck and Dubey, 1993). Affected animals show dyspnoea, cyanosis and fever. Morphological lesions comprise interstitial pneumonia, non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing hepatitis, adrenalitis and lymphadenitis. In other species, such as dogs with canine distemper virus infection, systemic toxoplasmosis often follows underlying immunosuppressive disease (Ehrensperger and Pospischil, 1989, Beineke et al., 2009); however, such primary infection has not been shown in the pig. The present report describes the clinical, morphological and aetiological findings in a pig with a concurrent PCV-2 infection and associated systemic toxoplasmosis.",

These changes are collective evidence of immunosuppression, which facilitates the development of coinfections (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2004). In the present case, primary PCV-2 infection may therefore have predisposed to the development of secondary systemic toxoplasmosis. Alternatively, stimulation of the immune system by vaccination or concurrent infection, in this case with T. gondii, may have resulted in proliferation of target cells allowing extensive replication of PCV-2 (Krakowka et al., 2001, Jacobsen et al., 2009).",

After ingestion of oocysts by intermediate hosts, tissue cysts are formed in 5\u20137 days (Dubey, 1997, Dubey et al., 1997). Man and animals become infected mainly by ingesting tissue cysts or oocysts. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat products containing T. gondii tissue cysts (bradyzoites) or ingestion of food or water contaminated with infectious oocysts (sporozoites) from cat faeces are risk factors associated with T. gondii infection (Hill et al., 2006).",

A similar situation occurs in animals with acquired immunodeficiency including dogs with canine distemper virus infection (Ehrensperger and Pospischil, 1989, Beineke et al., 2009). Toxoplasma encephalitis has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS, ranging between 5\u201310% in the US and 25\u201350% of AIDS patients in Europe (Suzuki, 1993). In man, congenital infection can lead to abortion and stillbirth in 10% of affected fetuses, or blindness and mental retardation of children (Hill and Dubey, 2002). Due to the fatal outcome in human patients, detection and removal of infected swine carcasses from the food chain is considered an important food safety issue (Hill et al., 2006). T. gondii infection is highly prevalent among pigs in many countries. With respect to the increased numbers of PCV-2 infections worldwide, systemic toxoplasmosis should be considered as a potential PCV-2 associated disease in pigs.",
