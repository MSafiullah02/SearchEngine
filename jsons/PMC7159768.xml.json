M. pneumoniae causes upper and lower RTI and has been shown to be the most common bacterial pathogen for community\u2010acquired pneumonia together with Streptococcus pneumoniae \n2, 3. M. pneumoniae\u2010associated RTIs are most often mild and self\u2010limiting in nature, and severe courses of disease are not common 4, 5. In the past, the detection of pathogen\u2010specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum has been the standard diagnostic test for M. pneumoniae RTI. However, elevated M. pneumoniae\u2010specific serum antibodies have been shown to persist for several months after infection and are also common in asymptomatic children, thus limiting their use for detection of an acute infection 6. Molecular methods for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae have therefore emerged and are now being used in clinical practice. However, the relationship between the detection of M. pneumoniae by nucleic acid amplification testing from a nasopharyngeal specimen and disease has been questioned in the light of evidence that it is also commonly detected among asymptomatic children 6. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of M. pneumoniae in routine nasopharyngeal specimens from children with a RTI and to detail clinical characteristics and management of M. pneumoniae\u2010positive patients.",

This is in line with findings from two previous studies in England/Wales and Germany in which M. pneumoniae was detected by PCR in 0.5\u20134% of patients with RTI 10, 11. These studies were performed before the occurrence of the most recent M. pneumoniae epidemics in Europe in 2010\u20132012 and other recent studies describing much higher rates of M. pneumoniae detection in children with RTI 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. For example, a study in the Netherlands including children aged 3 months to 16 years from July 2008 to November 2011 showed that 16% of children with RTI (mean age 2.7 years) and 21% of asymptomatic children (mean age 5.6 years) were positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR 6. Importantly, the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in children with RTI was lower in the years 2008/2009 compared to 2010/2011, with 4\u20137% and 21\u201324%, respectively, suggesting a considerable year\u2010to\u2010year variation likely influenced by the presence of local or national M. pneumoniae epidemics. The lower prevalence of M. pneumoniae in our study might be explained by an absence of an M. pneumoniae epidemic between 2010 and 2014 in our region. Such a diverse regional prevalence of M. pneumoniae seems possible as other European regions or countries in the same time interval also did not report an increasing M. pneumoniae prevalence 18. Unfortunately, Switzerland has no national surveillance of M. pneumoniae\u2010related RTI and it remains therefore difficult to confer our data to the whole country.",

A study from Italy including children admitted to hospital with RTI with a mean age of 5.2 years showed a M. pneumoniae prevalence of 23% 12. Similarly, in a study in Chile including children with community\u2010acquired pneumonia at a mean age of 4.9 years, 26.4% were positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR 13. A recent study in the United States showed only 3% M. pneumoniae prevalence in children below five years of age with community\u2010acquired pneumonia, compared to 17 and 24% in children aged five to nine years and 10\u201317 years, respectively 21. In our study, the median age of children included was 1.3 years and therefore lower than in all previous published studies.

However, the proportion of other pathogens identified was low in the group of M. pneumoniae\u2010positive children. This strongly suggests that the detection of M. pneumoniae in the nasopharyngeal specimen as a single organism increases the likelihood of causality for the RTI. This notion is supported by another study reporting that over 40% of symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae detected had no other pathogen identified in their nasopharyngeal specimen 6. There are limited data comparing sensitivity of upper versus lower respiratory tract samples for M. pneumoniae. However, the available evidence indicates that in most cases, both specimens are positive. Thus, the detection of M. pneumoniae in the nasopharyngeal specimen of a symptomatic child with lower RTI strongly implicates this pathogen as the cause of the pneumonia 23, 24. This interpretation is also in line with evidence showing the narrowing of the microbiota present in nasopharyngeal specimen from children with RTI 25. Further to this, CXR was more frequently performed and abnormal in the group of children with M. pneumoniae detected in nasopharyngeal specimens compared to those with negative results. This suggests an association of pneumonia in those with positive results.",

Interestingly, in our study, no short\u2010term treatment benefit such as reduced oxygen requirement or shorter hospital stay was found when comparing patients with empiric administration of a macrolide and those with prescription 48 hours later after M. pneumoniae infection had been confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing.

A further limitation is the potential lower sensitivity of multiplex PCR assays. However, retesting of stored samples with an independent M. pneumoniae\u2010specific nucleic acid amplification testing did not suggest lower sensitivity in line with recent results 29. However, sensitivity may also be influenced by the storage itself, which cannot be excluded in the current study setting. The study was done in a limited region and time frame, and this may limit generalisability of the study results. Further to this, results and comparisons of results from the group with negative M. pneumoniae testing require cautious interpretation as they represent only a small and potentially nonrepresentative group of M. pneumoniae\u2010negative patients.",
