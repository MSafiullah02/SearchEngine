This finding inferred that no major residual E coli proteins existed in the purified antigens used in the antibody assays. After initial screening by the nucleocapsid ELISA, potentially false-positive results caused by cross-reaction with minute amounts of residual E coli proteins, not detectable by Coomassie blue staining, were eliminated by the nucleocapsid western-blot assay. Potentially false-positive findings due to antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses were further eliminated by the spike western-blot assay.",

Results showed that none of the 21 and seven pairs of serum samples from patients with OC43 and 229E infections, respectively, were positive by the nucleocapsid ELISA, nucleocapsid western blot, and spike western blot, although four showed false-positive results on the ELISA, three of which also showed bands by the nucleocapsid western blot (unpublished data).",

As for the different sampling populations, it is interesting to see that seroprevalence varies from 0\u00b7009% to 1\u00b78%.3, 4 In the study that showed a seroprevalence of 1\u00b78%, all 17 positive samples were confirmed with the viral neutralisation assay.",
