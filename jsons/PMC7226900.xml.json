While the boundaries of this principle continue to evolve, particularly as new threats emerge ranging from avian flu to Zika virus, it was preventing the international spread of cholera that first brought nations together to lay the foundations of international health law over 160 years ago. Cholera was in turn the sole subject of the first binding multilateral agreement in international health law\u2014indeed, the first three such agreements\u2014and the disease has remained a constant thread woven throughout the history and development of international health law to the present day. The Haitian epidemic thus serves as a reminder both of why the international community first came together to address the shared threat of cholera using the tool of international law, and the deadly consequences of ignoring this longstanding principle.",

This is readily apparent in the early development of international law around cholera and will be discussed in detail later in this chapter; for the time being, it suffices to say that while acceptance of the principle that evidence-based measures should be taken to prevent the international spread of cholera is widespread and longstanding, the precise measures thought capable of doing so have necessarily evolved alongside changes in scientific knowledge and understanding. The evidentiary aspect has implications not only for what measures might be considered sufficient, but also those that might be deemed excessive; as discussed below, one of the key goals of adopting international standards relating to the spread of cholera has been to avoid undue interference with international trade through overzealous application of measures like quarantines or import bans. As such, adherence to the underlying principle of preventing the international spread of cholera cannot be assessed by determining whether the practice of states or other international law actors is the same as it was a century ago; rather, it must be by whether their practice at any given time has been guided by contemporaneous evidence-based standards in the service of that principle. Nevertheless, while our understanding of the manner in which the international spread of cholera could be prevented has evolved considerably over the last 160 years, certain elements of our knowledge have changed more drastically than others. Some central concepts, such as the importance of clean water and proper sanitation, have long been well understood; others, such as the utility of vaccination as a preventative measure, have fluctuated over time, as new vaccines, and evidence of their efficacy, emerge. Furthermore, collection and sharing of accurate information has also historically been a core component both of the law (particularly in the recording and notification of cases) and of the broader science that informs what measures the law should either require or, in cases where overreaction is a concern, permit, in fulfilment of the principle of preventing the international spread of cholera. Although international health law has expanded over the past 160 years, these core elements, and cholera itself, remain constant. All these elements come into play in what unfolded in Haiti.",

European contact brought diseases like smallpox that devastated the original indigenous inhabitants, removing a source of manual labour for the colonial powers and leading to their replacement with African slaves. In turn, yellow fever first brought from Africa as an inadvertent by-product of this human cargo later took a serious toll on soldiers freshly dispatched from France, playing a valuable supporting role in making Haiti the first and only modern state to gain independence through a successful slave revolt.7 It has even been suggested that popular perceptions associating Haiti with the emerging HIV epidemic in the early 1980s caused a drastic reduction in American tourists, in turn leading to a drop in income that helped destabilise and eventually topple the Duvalier regime.8 The bitter irony of these events is that historical records indicate Haiti was one of the few countries to escape the scourge of cholera during the nineteenth century epidemics that propelled the very development of international health law that forms the focus of this chapter.9\n",

It was here that a MINUSTAH base had recently welcomed a contingent of soldiers from Nepal, a cholera-endemic country in the midst of its own outbreak. At least one of these soldiers was carrying Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera.12 Cholera is spread through water contaminated with infected faeces. It causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, and can cause death by dehydration within as little as a few hours if left untreated. Due to improper sanitation practices, infected faeces from the MINUSTAH base entered the Artibonite river system, which is relied upon by tens of thousands of Haitians for farming, bathing and drinking.13 The disease spread rapidly throughout the country, and was found in all ten regions of the country by the following month, as well as over the border in the Dominican Republic.14 It subsequently spread into Cuba and Mexico.15\n",

A combination of basic shoe-leather epidemiological investigation and high-tech genetic analysis of disease samples demonstrates conclusively that the Haitian strain of cholera has its origins in Nepal and arrived via the MINUSTAH base.19 Had the UN adhered to the longstanding international law principle of preventing the international spread of cholera, this tragedy could have been prevented.",

Such links have continued until the present day.27 In particular, its spread was tied directly to the increasing size and speed of international trade, which was itself rapidly redefining international relations. In turn, striking the balance between preventing the spread of cholera and minimizing disruption to burgeoning international trade has been a constant theme in the development of the law. Other conditions in the nineteenth century helped facilitate its spread as well. Unlike many other diseases that increasingly drew the attention of European politicians and scientists in the age of colonial expansion, cholera was readily adaptable to life outside the tropics. It was spread through poor sanitation, meaning it could be passed on as readily, if not more readily, in England or France as in its historical home in the Ganges Delta. Rapid European urbanisation in the era of industrialisation fuelled precisely such conditions; crowded slums with inadequate sanitation proved a fertile breeding ground. Ultimately, as one commentator describes it, \u201cAsiatic cholera has a good claim to be regarded as the classic epidemic disease of the nineteenth century, above all of Europe in the age of industrialisation.\u201d28 Taken altogether, these factors ensured that cholera became the focus of the Conference.",

However, as discussed in detail below, it was not ultimately disagreement over the value of preventing the spread of cholera that created the delay in agreeing upon the concrete and codified steps to address it. Rather, it was lack of understanding of what those measures should be, hindered by the dearth of basic knowledge such as what caused cholera and how it was spread. Interestingly, the balance of the medical and the political was struck in the delegations for each participating country, with each team of two consisting of a diplomat and a physician. As Howard-Jones notes, the voting system at the first Conference allowed these two members to vote separately, even contradictorily.31 Under such circumstances, it is difficult to know what to make of the knowledge that \u201c[i]n his address at the closure of the first conference, the French Minister of Agriculture and Trade congratulated the participants on their discretion and wisdom in divorcing themselves not only from all questions of politics - but also of science.\u201d32 Ultimately, despite the involvement of an increasingly large and diverse set of countries over subsequent Conferences, a scientific consensus on cholera and its causes was not quickly forthcoming. Nevertheless, Birn argues that the meetings themselves, \u201cfar more than the elaboration of the germ theory, the identification of vectors and microorganisms, or the signing of conventions best characterise success in this initial stage.\u201d33 This is fortunate, given that it would take another six meetings over 41 years before sufficient consensus was found to permit a binding agreement to be reached.",

This moment did not even occur until three years after the initial International Sanitary Conference. In 1854, Doctor John Snow mapped cholera cases during an epidemic in London\u2019s Soho district. His map allowed him to trace the source of the epidemic back to a well in Broad Street, demonstrating that the disease was transmitted through contaminated water.37 Despite justified acclaim today, the medical establishment of the era was not so accepting of Snow\u2019s theory that cholera was waterborne; for decades afterwards, other theories on the origins of cholera continued to hold sway at the Conferences, ranging from airborne transmission to some unique property of the soil, or to elaborate combinations of such factors. Even after Robert Koch, the founder of modern microbiology, identified the cholera bacterium in 1884, helping advance the germ theory of disease in the process, widespread acceptance of the cause of cholera was not immediate. One of the most influential proponents of alternative theories, the famed German hygienist Max von Pettenkofer, would hold onto them until the end of his career.38 Indeed, as a further illustration of the fickle integration of scientific discovery into mainstream medical thought, Vibrio cholerae had already been isolated and identified as the cause of cholera, to virtually no acclaim, by Filippo Pacini in 1854, the same year that Snow had the handle removed from the Broad Street pump.39 In the end, unanimous acceptance of cholera as a waterborne disease would not come until the Eleventh Conference in 1903.40 As a result, the desire to take effective steps to prevent cholera transmission was initially hampered by a lack of scientific knowledge, further exacerbated by the slow mainstream acceptance of new discoveries.",

This increasing internationalisation was due in large part to the fact cholera itself had become a truly global problem over the same period, affecting almost all corners of the globe. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the world suffered through the third (approx. 1852\u20131860) and fourth (approx. 1863\u20131875) cholera pandemics, and it was in the midst of a fifth (approx. 1881\u20131896) by the time the first binding multilateral agreement on preventing international transmission of disease was signed at the seventh International Sanitary Conference in Venice.",

Its focus was the Suez Canal, which had shortened the travel time between Europe and the Indian Subcontinent considerably since it opened in 1869.

Once sown, however, the seeds of international health law sprouted quickly. In quick succession, subsequent International Sanitary Conventions yielded the first expansions of the field of international health law, or, perhaps more precisely in the earliest years, the field of international cholera law. Measures agreed upon in Dresden (1893) included expanding the geographic scope of the agreement and adding notification provisions.42 The next agreement, this time in Paris (1894), dealt specifically with the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, continuing the emphasis on keeping \u201cAsiatic cholera\u201d out of Europe.43\n",

At times, politics came to the fore; plans to combine the two were undone by objections of the United States, a member of OHIP but not the League.51 These organisations were complemented by regional bodies like the International Sanitary Bureau, the precursor to the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO). This organisation was in fact the oldest of all international health bodies, having been formed in 1902; it would promptly address cholera within its own regional Convention in 1903.52 Concern for cholera was evident at all levels. For instance, a 1920 report from a League of Nations delegation highlights the role of foreign soldiers\u2014foreshadowing events in Haiti\u2014in spreading cholera from Russia to Poland.53\n",

In the process, it has moved towards creating a truly global approach to health, shifting away from the Eurocentric viewpoint of the early Conventions towards a more universalist outlook in line with the objectives of the UN system. Furthermore, from its inception, the WHO has had more power than its predecessor organisations. In particular, Article 21 of the WHO\u2019s Constitution gives the organisation the authority to create regulations to address \u201csanitary and quarantine requirements and other procedures designed to prevent the international spread of disease\u201d.54 Further enhancing its reach is its \u201copt-out\u201d model for such regulations, replacing the opt-in nature of traditional treaties such as the International Sanitary Conventions, thus ensuring the near-universal reach of its rules.55 It is also important to note that in addition to its legal function, the WHO also plays a key role in promoting international standards for cholera prevention and control from a scientific perspective.56 Although not themselves legally binding, these standards influence national policy and international responses, including around proper measures for the prevention of cross-border spread.

Nonetheless, after the initial adoption of the International Sanitary Regulations, evolution over the next half century would be slow; as Fidler notes, one of the only large-scale changes was to cut back drastically on the number of restrictions governing religious pilgrimages.58 Still, the ISR were revised and re-christened as the International Health Regulations (IHR) in 1969, at which time typhus and relapsing fever were removed from the list of diseases, leaving only four: cholera, plague and yellow fever, plus smallpox.59 At this point, improved sanitary standards had largely removed cholera as a concern in the European states that first gathered in 1851, but it remained a threat in many parts of the world.",

In turn, the decision to keep cholera in the IHRs, while modifying the specifics of the response, highlights the international consensus on the importance of maintaining binding legal rules hindering its international spread.62 At the same time, the resulting modifications reflect how emerging scientific evidence resulted in changes to the measures to be taken to prevent that spread. The biggest modification to the IHRs at the time was to remove requirements around cholera vaccination, including the right of countries to demand a vaccination certificate from incoming travellers. What had once been considered an appropriate action was now judged an overreaction not supported by scientific evidence of its public health efficacy.

This objective was highlighted early in the first Conference by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, who stated that \u201cthe imbalance created in the international system and trade by having separate sanitary regulations has to be eliminated.\u201d79 When Fidler outlines the \u201cclassical regime\u201d of the first century of international health law, he describes it as having \u201ctwo basic parts: obligations on States Parties to (1) notify each other about outbreaks of specified infectious diseases in their territories; and (2) limit disease-prevention measures that restricted international trade and travel to those based on scientific evidence and public health principles.\u201d80 These issues are reflected throughout the development of international health law. For instance, the International Sanitary Convention (1903) notes, \u201cNo merchandise is capable by itself of transmitting plague or cholera. It only becomes dangerous when contaminated by plague or cholera products.\u201d81 Similar debates around the effectiveness of cholera prevention measures and their impact on trade have surfaced much more recently, particularly in the context of states imposing excessive, scientifically unsupported measures on others to prevent the importation of cholera. The economic consequences can be severe; as one example, it is estimated the 1991 epidemic cost Peru hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade and tourism.82 As such, highlighting the need for proportionate, evidence-based responses is important in order to help minimise the possibility states will cover up epidemics for fear of the economic consequences.",

This is not simply a matter of historical inertia; cholera has been inserted explicitly into new agreements in a variety of fields of law, while the need to retain it during the reform of existing instruments has been explicitly debated and its presence reconfirmed. At the same time, ongoing discussion has ensured that both the minimum precautions that need to be taken to prevent the international spread of cholera, and the maximum measures that scientific evidence will support, have evolved over time. At a minimum, the development of international health law over the past century and a half shows a clear recognition by international law actors that the principle of prevention of the international spread of cholera is an important one.

For a cholera outbreak to occur, two conditions must be met: (1) there must be significant breeches [sic] in the water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure used by groups of people, permitting large-scale exposure to food or water contaminated with Vibrio cholera organisms; and (2) cholera must be present in the population. While the current water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure in Haiti would certainly facilitate transmission of cholera (and many other illnesses), cholera is not circulating in Haiti, and the risk of cholera introduction to Haiti is low. Most current travelers to Haiti are relief workers from countries without endemic cholera, and they are likely to have access to adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities within Haiti, such that any cholera organisms they import would be safely contained.

            "text": "However, it is clear that risks arose even before the infected peacekeepers arrived in Haiti. One fundamental problem arises from the fact that at the time the epidemic began, the Medical Manual for UN Peacekeeping then in use focused entirely upon preventing peacekeepers from falling ill, without considering what threats peacekeepers might introduce into the populations they are meant to protect.95 Much like the Fortress Europe approach of the early International Sanitary Conventions, this is an archaic approach treating disease as a one-way threat emanating from certain populations to menace others. This is despite both hundreds of years of history of soldiers serving as vectors for disease, and the more recent fact that UN peacekeeping presents a unique set of risk factors for introducing outside diseases into vulnerable populations.96 Recall the CDC briefing document highlighted earlier, which states \u201c[m]ost current travelers to Haiti are relief workers from countries without endemic cholera\u201d.97 By contrast, the current model of UN peacekeeping relies heavily on troops from lower income countries which themselves face higher domestic burdens of infectious disease. In turn, peacekeeping brings these troops into contact with vulnerable populations in interactions that would otherwise be unlikely to occur. Here, trade serves to illustrate the unique international interactions facilitated by United Nations peacekeeping. Given that, according to Nepalese Government statistics, bilateral trade with Haiti in 2010 amounted to roughly US$10,000, peacekeeping appears to have been responsible for creating an interaction that would not have happened outside the auspices of the United Nations.98 This is not to suggest for a moment that such interactions are undesirable; it is simply to note the importance of ensuring that the accompanying risks are evaluated and addressed. Indeed, as international cooperation between countries of the global south increases outside the UN framework, it is important that the potential health ramifications are considered by both national governments and nongovernmental organisations.",

For instance, Edmond Mulet, then Under-Secretary-General in charge of MINUSTAH, told media that peacekeepers were tested for cholera before deployment to Haiti, something repeatedly demonstrated to be untrue.100 The lack of any such pre-deployment measures was confirmed by the Nepalese Army\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, among others.101\n",

At the same time, it rejects the recommendations on screening and prophylaxis.110 The fact sheet does not provide the evidence relied upon to support this decision, instead referring to a closed-door PAHO/WHO Expert Consultation on Pharmacological Measures for Prevention of Cholera Introduction in Non-endemic Areas; although a final report was generated in this consultation, it has never been publically released.111 Thus, while the actual results of the Expert Consultation may indeed be compelling, it is impossible to evaluate them. Concealing from public and expert scrutiny what is presumably an objective evaluation by scientific experts of prospective methods of preventing cholera transmission is not in any way conducive to preventing the international spread of cholera in future. By contrast, where further research has been conducted and shared publically, very different conclusions have been reached. Modelling from Yale University suggests that not only would screening and prophylaxis be effective, but that they would be more cost-effective than vaccination.112 The UN has yet to directly engage with this study and its implications.",

In turn, this poses the threat of the introduction, or re-introduction, of malaria into malaria-free areas, or the introduction of drug-resistant strains into areas where those drugs are still effective.116 This latter scenario is of particular concern given that peacekeepers from countries where resistance to artemisinin-based drugs has emerged are frequently deployed in regions of Africa where the burden of malaria is especially high and those drugs remain a vital public health tool.117 This is a key example of the need for further practical reforms in the aftermath of Haiti.",

With a history stretching back over 160 years, including over a century of binding multilateral obligations, it is evident that preventing the international spread of cholera is a robust and longstanding international legal principle. It is also clear that the UN violated it. It is less clear what the practical implications of this principle and its violation are for the people of Haiti going forward. The term \u201ccholera forcing\u201d was pejoratively coined to refer to the idea that \u201ccholera epidemics, both in the nineteenth century and today, were and can be the key stimulus for procurement of safe water and sanitation.\u201d120 This has not been the experience in Haiti, where the introduction of this previously unknown disease has only exacerbated serious pre-existing problems with access to water and sanitation. As of the time of this writing, a series of plans to address cholera has come and gone, with none of them ever raising even close to the funds required to carry them out.121 The more recent package accompanying Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s apology in December of 2016 remains drastically underfunded.122\n",

And while the UN has taken some steps to prevent a similar public health disaster from occurring in the future, it is not yet clear if these steps will be sufficient, or indeed whether they are being taken in practice as well as on paper. By contrast, the West African Ebola outbreak, which claimed a similar number of lives but garnered considerably more media coverage, has attracted not only vastly greater sums of money but also drawn far more international attention to failures to implement the IHRs, as well as broader questions about the capacity of the WHO, and the wider international community, to effectively tackle the international spread of disease.123 The difference in attitude towards the two diseases was hammered home in the midst of the Ebola outbreak, when the UN was quick to suspend the rotation of peacekeepers from the affected countries to MINUSTAH in Haiti.124 Ebola, perceived as a danger by wealthy and influential countries that have not felt threatened by cholera for decades, may yet direct the course of changes of international law around the transmission of disease. For Haiti, however, a tragic first encounter with cholera, occurring a century and a half after it served as the initial catalyst for states to come together to establish legal measures to prevent the international spread of disease, has resulted in much legal debate but little justice.",
