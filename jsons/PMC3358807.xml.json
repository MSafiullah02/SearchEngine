Human diseases originating from a nonhuman animal reservoir are referred to as zoonoses. Some recent emerging and re\u2010emerging viral zoonoses include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, rabies virus, avian influenza viruses (AIV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus, hantaviruses, and West Nile virus. The two strains of HIV, HIV\u20101, and HIV\u20102, evolved from two simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) carried by the chimpanzee and Sooty mangabey, respectively (Bengis et al. [2004]). Outbreaks of Ebola virus in humans have been associated with disease in chimpanzees, and the 2003 SARS outbreak originated from the masked palm civet (Bengis et al. [2004]). The source of Nipah and Hendra viral outbreaks have been traced to bats, whereas hantaviruses are carried by wild rodents, primarily rats and mice (Bengis et al.

Mathematical models of infectious diseases in wildlife have been used to increase our understanding of these mechanisms and to test hypotheses about effective methods for prevention and control of infectious diseases in wildlife and humans. The collection of work in the books edited by Grenfell and Dobson [1995] and Hudson et al. [2002] summarizes some of these modeling efforts. Our goals are to provide a review of some of the mathematical modeling frameworks developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and to provide references for more detailed analyses. A recent survey of 442 modeling studies of zoonotic pathogens by Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. [2009] found few dynamical models that account for multi\u2010host pathogens, multiple pathogens, within\u2010host pathogen dynamics in zoonotic transmission and pathogen evolution. In this review, we highlight these gaps and others in the modeling process that need to be filled to address important questions about viral zoonoses in wildlife. We examine some of the factors governing viral maintenance and transmission in the primary animal reservoir, how these factors have been accounted for in mathematical models and where additional modeling efforts are needed.",

When the disease is maintained in the reservoir population, the stages are cyclic (1) \u2192 (2) \u2192 (3) \u2192 (4) \u2192 (1). A viral infection begins with contact or exposure of an animal host with a particular pathogen. At the first stage, environmental conditions including climate, seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, landscape, and resources (i.e., habitat, food, water) may individually or collectively determine whether there is contact between host and pathogen (Altizer et al. [2006], Previtali et al. [2010]). In addition, the host\u2019s intrinsic characteristics, its population and social structure, mobility, behavior, and susceptibility may modulate the extent of its exposure. In the second stage, the within\u2010host and cellular level, the virus must overcome physical barriers of the host, and must be compatible with cell receptors to gain entry into a target cell. After viral entry, the third stage, viral replication depends on host and viral genetics as well as host factors, such as the immune response, prior exposure, nutritional status, co\u2010infection, age, sex, and reproductive status. Establishment of an infection in one host does not necessarily mean transmission to another host, as it may be a dead\u2010end host. Transmission, the fourth stage of infection, depends on viral load, mode of viral shedding, host factors, and the community intra\u2010 and inter\u2010host ecological interactions. These latter interactions are also affected by the spatial environment and anthropogenic factors.",

Mathematical models and techniques developed for spread of disease in humans often apply to wildlife populations but there are key differences. For example, the wildlife reservoir has adapted to the specific viral infection while this is not the case for humans. In addition, environmental effects and anthropogenic disturbances have a much greater impact on diseases in wildlife than in humans. Mathematical models developed for diseases of wildlife often concentrate on the population level, omitting steps (2) and (3) (Grenfell and Dobson [1995], Hudson et al. [2002]). Preventive and control measures (e.g., vaccination or culling) are often studied in terms of stages (1) and (4), whereas the effectiveness of treatment strategies (e.g., drug treatment) are studied within stages (2) and (3). In Section 3, we summarize some of the mathematical modeling efforts for stages (1) and (4), and models for stages (2) and (3) in Section 4.",

            "text": "Although the within\u2010host and population dynamics are often modeled separately, host\u2010pathogen interactions at the within\u2010host level can influence the dynamics of the system at the population level in a number of ways. The pathogen may alter the host by changing its reproductive, movement or social behavior (Murray et al. [1986], Murray and Seward [1992], Klein et al. [2004], van Gils et al. [2007]). A pathogen may shorten the host lifespan, e.g., H5N1 influenza virus in chickens (Chen et al. [2006]). A better understanding of the behavior of the pathogen within\u2010host will lead to better models and more accurate parameterization for host\u2010pathogen interactions on a population or evolutionary level (Mideo et al. [2008]). For instance, knowledge of within\u2010host biology tells us if we need to address time since infection or changes in immunity, persistently infectious individuals versus short\u2010term infection resulting in recovery and possibly immunity. Host biology may tell us that infectivity is age\u2010dependent or that infection alters behavior, e.g., hantavirus infection in male rodents increases aggression (Klein et al. [2004]), rabies infection in foxes increases erratic movement (Murray and Seward [1992], Murray et al. [1986]), low pathogenic avian influenza infection in swans delays migration (van Gils et al. [2007]). Host or pathogen biology may differ in space or time (seasonality) and the environment may play a significant role in the contact process, especially in an animal reservoir, e.g., spatial overlap of habitats leading to spill over of hantavirus infection in rodents (Allen et al. [2009]). Multiple hosts may amplify or dilute the pathogen effects or multiple pathogen co\u2010infection may decrease the effectiveness of the immune response. That is, increased biodiversity in bird species reduces spillover of West Nile virus in humans (Swaddle and Calos [2008]), reduced species diversity increases infection prevalence of Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Dizney and Ruedas [2009]), micro\u2010 and macro\u2010parasitic co\u2010infection induces antagonistic immune responses (Fenton et al. [2008]). In summary, the within\u2010host biology leads to a particular choice of model at the population level, such as an SI model with susceptible and infectious stages or an SIR model with susceptible, infectious, recovered and immune stages. Alternately, an SI\n1\nI\n2 model with susceptible and two infectious stages could be applied if the infection modifies the behavior of some individuals, such as those in infectious stage 2 but not stage 1. These types of models are discussed in more detail in the following sections.",

The flow diagram of an SIR model, S\u2192I\u2192R, means a susceptible individual becomes infectious then recovers and is immune. The model is the same as the well\u2010known SIR epidemic model, but the term \u201cepizootic\u201d is used in place of \u201cepidemic\u201d to emphasize that we are applying these models to outbreaks in animal populations. The term epizootic refers to a single outbreak, whereas enzootic implies persistence of the disease in an animal population. If there is no immunity, then re\u2010infection may occur and the model is known as an SIS model; whereas if immunity wanes, then the model is known as an SIRS model. The simplest type of model assumes homogeneous mixing. That is, all susceptible individuals are equally likely to become infectious depending on the number of contacts (c) per unit time of an infectious individual with other individuals in the population and the probability (q) that a contact results in an infection.",

Here 1/(\u03b3+\u03b1) is the average infectious period, and  is the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual introduced into an entirely susceptible population during an individuals\u2019 infectious period (Hethcote [2000]).

For a few systems where data are available, either standard or mass action incidence, have provided reasonable fits to observed data in wildlife. For example, standard incidence was fit to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) data from feral cats (Fromont et al. [1997]) and mass action incidence (plus transmission of the virus via the environment) was fit to avian influenza data from wild birds from the Camargue, France (Roche et al. [2009]). Estimates for the transmission rate for FeLV were obtained from the \u201ctime between the first contact with a contagious individual and the onset of infection\u201d (Fromont et al. [1997], Pedersen et al. [1977]). The reciprocal of this value gives an estimate of \u03b2 in the case of standard incidence ranging from 3.08 to 11.76 per year, with population densities ranging from 120 in rural settings to 1100 in urban settings (Fromont et al. [1997]). The contact rates for avian influenza, reported in Roche et al. [2009], were varied (with non transmission parameters kept fixed) to find the best fit of the model results to data. Contact rate was not calculated explicitly but the transmission rate was calculated. The value of N was in the region of 105, large enough to use a deterministic model, and was calculated from ornithological data. Other possible incidence rates are discussed by McCallum et al.

The basic stochastic SIS and SIR models include variability due to transmission, recovery and disease\u2010related deaths. Stochastic SIS and SIR models can be used to predict the probability of an outbreak, the final size distribution of an epizootic, the expected duration of an epizootic or the limiting stationary or quasistationary probability distribution. For example, an approximation to the probability of an outbreak, PO, in either discrete\u2010event, stochastic SIS or SIR models depends on the initial number of infected individuals, I\n0, and on the basic reproduction number , as defined in (2) or (3):\n\ngiven .

Although there has been much theoretical research in stochastic SIR and SIS epidemic models, fewer stochastic models have been applied to zoonotic diseases and even fewer to viral zoonoses in wildlife populations. Thresholds in wildlife populations are more difficult to assess than in human or domestic animal populations due to lack of sufficient data (failed outbreaks are often not observed), possibility of alternative but unknown reservoirs and the differences in the types of thresholds (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al.

Reproductive differences between species can be introduced through the birth rates, that is, births can occur at a constant rate through the year, as is often modeled for human populations (Anderson and May [1992]), or as a seasonal pulse, which is often more probable in animal populations (Keeling and Rohani [2008]). The former case will provide (assuming no vertical transmission) a constant stream of new susceptibles into the population, whereas seasonal births will provide an influx of new susceptibles at a given time each year. The implications can be a sudden change in the  value for the population with a corresponding change in the level of vaccination required for herd immunity. Behavioral differences in the sexes where male rodents\u2019 aggressive behavior when infected with hantavirus (Klein and Calisher [2007], Klein et al.

Analyses of the models revealed distinct thresholds that depend on these sexual differences. Age structure or age since infection can be accounted for in models through either discrete or continuous ages and through multiple infectious stages indicating time since infection (Keeling and Rohani [2008]). Models with juveniles and adults whose behavioral differences may affect the disease dynamics have been considered in wildlife diseases, e.g., spread of rabies (Suppo et al. [2000]) but data are limited on age\u2010structure or times since infection in wildlife populations. Addressing the heterogeneity in the host population has not been well studied but it clearly has implications for the maintenance and spread of viral pathogens. The best illustration of the importance of heterogeneity in host response to pathogens is the incidence of superspreaders (Woolhouse et al. [1997], Galvani and May [2005]), in which 20% of a host population contributes to 80% of transmission (20/80 rule).

The parameter \u03b1j is a measure of pathogen virulence. The preceding result implies that it is to the pathogen\u2019s advantage to evolve to reduced virulence, that is, to evolve so that \u03b1j is small and  is large (Bremermann and Thieme [1989], Levin and Pimentel [1981]). A well\u2010known natural experiment of myxoma virus in rabbits supports this hypothesis (Fenner and Ratcliffe [1965], Fenner and Myers [1978], Levin and Pimentel [1981]). The European rabbit, introduced into Australia in the mid 1800s, rapidly increased to very high densities causing a serious problem to agriculture. To control the rabbit population, a lethal strain of myxoma virus was introduced in the mid 1950s. The initial mortality rate in infected rabbits was estimated at 99.8% (Fenner and Myers [1978], Levin and Pimentel [1981]). But over time, the mortality decreased, the virulence level of the virus decreased in the rabbit population. The relationship between reduced virulence and disease persistence is not as simple as a decrease in pathogen reproduction number with virulence, \u03b1j (see e.g., Ackleh and Allen [2003, 2005], Anderson and May [1992], Bremermann and Thieme [1989], Day [2002], Day and Burns [2003], May and Nowak [1994, 1995], Pugliese [2002]).

This model has been extensively investigated with respect to human infectious diseases, in particular HIV\u20101 (e.g., Nowak and May [2000], Perelson and Nelson [1999]).

The death rate of infected target cells exceeds that of healthy cells, \u03b4I > \u03b4T.

Two important cellular components of the adaptive immune response are B cells and T cells. The B cells are responsible for generation of antibody molecules and T cells are responsible for production of cytokines and killing of infected cells. In response to a viral pathogen, B cells are activated to produce antibodies, molecules specific to a particular virus particle. Antibodies bind to a specific virus particle so that it can be recognized and cleared by multiple mechanisms, including by macrophages, which can then present antigen to T cells. Natural killer cells also are activated by receptors on the surface of infected cells. They bind to these receptors and release chemicals inside the cell that may either kill the infected cell or cause the infected cell to stop replication of the virus particle.

[2008]). When a virus jumps to a naive host, the immune response may be very strong. For example, in some viral infections, the CTL response can lead to tissue damage and if severe enough, host death (Wodarz [2007]). Wodarz [2007] refers to this latter type of response as CTL\u2010induced pathology. In addition, the immunological response and infection length are influenced by current infections and infection history (Telfer et al. [2008]). Pedersen and Fenton [2007] emphasize the importance of understanding the community ecology at the level of the within\u2010host, that is, a tri\u2010trophic level interaction among the immune system, pathogen community and their respective target cells. The differences in the immune response to a viral pathogen by a reservoir as opposed to a spill over species needs further investigation. These differences in responses are key to understanding host\u2010switching and cross\u2010species pathogen transmission (Childs et al. [2007], Hochberg and Holt [1990], Parrish et al.

Regardless if one uses the concept of quasispecies to describe intra\u2010host variation of RNA viruses or population theories, it is well supported that RNA viruses have a high mutation rate and lack error\u2010correcting mechanisms. This lack of error correction results in a greater diversity and distribution of the viral genetics that may be selected upon within the host following a successful infection. Insight into the mechanism in which viruses adapt to new hosts is critical since many new viral zoonoses are RNA viruses, such as hantaviruses, avian influenza viruses, Nipah virus and SARS CoV.

[2010] model the epidemiological dynamics as the first tier via a stochastic SiIiRi model for each antigenic variant, then the genetic sequence evolution as the second tier to model production of new antigenic variants. The modeling simulations can be related to phylogenetic diagrams of virus lineages (e.g., influenza A and B) (Koelle et al. [2010]).",

            "text": "Gaps exist in modeling of wildlife viral zoonoses that need further investigation to move the field forward. Models that can evaluate the genomic trajectory of particular RNA viruses in reservoir host species are essential to understanding how viral zoonoses are maintained in nature. Additionally, models that incorporate selective pressures (e.g., resources such as food and water, predators, breeding cycles), infection history and the heterogeneity in an animal\u2019s ability to maintain and amplify a pathogen can be used to probe how viruses are maintained in their reservoirs and to determine what drives spill over into new nonreservoir species. There is a need for increased surveillance of wildlife diseases and inclusion of this data in model formulation and analysis. Difficulties encountered due to case acquisition and underreporting, and lack of existing wildlife surveillance infrastructure and validated diagnostic tests need to be overcome (Stallknecht [2007]). Modeling is crucial given that the successful spill over event is rare, and can help drive hypothesis testing that can capture such events in controlled experimental or field settings. With respect to immunological pressures, many unanswered questions need to be addressed with models. For example, what are the mechanisms of the immune response in the wildlife host that lead to a persistent infection or to the possibility of a superspreader? How and why does it differ in the spill over dead\u2010end host that either dies or has no productive infection? How does the immune response differ when a host is infected with a single versus multiple pathogens? What effects do seasonality or climate change have on the immune response and disease susceptibility? What are the drivers of host\u2010switching events that lead to emergence of new disease? Formulation and analysis of more detailed within\u2010host models to existing population level model structures will be necessary to accurately evaluate and predict risk of infection and development of disease in animal populations.",

The models described are mathematical, deterministic and stochastic, and are therefore limited in scope. We did not discuss statistical models or statistical techniques that are valuable in the study of viral zoonoses and that are especially important in fitting models to data. We mentioned briefly some of the computationally intensive models that use information about geography, landscape and environment to identify factors associated with high prevalence of disease in wildlife or to model disease spread.
