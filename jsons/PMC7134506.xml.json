A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen and provisionally designated 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).1 As of February 10, 2020, 42,638 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed in China, with 21,675 suspected cases and 1016 deaths. There are still more than 3000 confirmed cases every day, involving people living in or visiting Wuhan, as a subsequent characteristic of human-to-human transmission. 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world and has been reported in other countries such as the United States.2 Hospitals in all provinces and cities across China have taken effective measures to control the spread of 2019-nCoV.",

We did not, however, completely halt the services to some patients who need to visit the dermatology outpatient department during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. At the same time, to meet the medical requirements and reduce the flow of patients to the skin clinic, we began free online and telephone consultation by providing free dermatology consultations. The dermatology outpatient department in West China Hospital was scheduled to run on January 28, 2020, mainly for critical care patients. Patients who had made an advanced appointment for obtaining medical service but chose not to visit received a full refund of registration fees.",
