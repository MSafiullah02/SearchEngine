Robust CDS systems must be derived and validated via creation of multi-reviewer adjudicated gold standard datasets. Manual annotation of physiologic data such as mechanical ventilator waveform data (VWD) can be time-consuming, and lacks methodological consistency in dataset development. To address these issues, we have created a system for annotating and adjudicating VWD called the Annotation PipeLine (APL) to optimize VWD annotation by expert reviewers. APL combines visual assessment of waveform characteristics with metadata display, enabling inclusion of quantitative thresholds into annotation decisions by reviewers. APL also includes specific features for resolving multireviewer disagreements and generating gold standard data sets. APL's unique combination of methods and open source framework may accelerate the creation of CDS algorithms for ventilator management, and may serve as a model for future research into physiologic waveform annotation systems.",

By utilizing expert-derived rules and machine learning, algorithmic classifiers can support CDS systems that can function with complex data types, and patient and disease heterogeneity. High-performance model development requires well characterized datasets annotated for salient events by expert clinicians through a process of multi-reviewer adjudication.(1-3) Accurately and reproducibly annotating data requires substantial investment of effort from time-limited, expert reviewers, which to date has limited the size and generalizability of validated datasets.

(8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . To develop and validate high performance classifiers, clinicians have historically been required to manually annotate large volumes of ventilator waveform data (VWD) by visually analyzing the shape and magnitude of air flow and pressure data. (7) (8) (9) (10) 13) However, this process is time-consuming, subjective, and has been marked by low inter-rater agreement due to visual classification criteria based on \"expert opinion\", as well as data management challenges resulting from the high volume of data and the laborious manual annotation process. (7, 10, 17) Previous groups have developed waveform annotation software that can handle large volume data and output categorization results, but these efforts lack the specific functionality necessary for overcoming problems inherent with annotating VWD. (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . These challenges are: 1) consistent annotation workflows do not exist for VWD annotation, which has led to the creation of datasets that are potentially non-reproducible across medical centers (17), and 2) large, high-quality, multi-reviewer adjudicated datasets of VWD are highly timeconsuming to generate for expert clinicians. (7) With these challenges in mind, we sought to address gaps in the field of VWD annotation by developing the Annotation PipeLine (APL). APL supports expert annotation of ventilator data and builds on concepts from existing platforms for annotating data other than VWD. (31, 32) Utilizing APL, we have been able to annotate and provide dual clinician validation for over 315,000 ventilator recorded breaths across two different datasets. These data comprise some of the largest recorded breath-level, multi-clinician adjudicated datasets for use in developing algorithms to improve the delivery of MV.(1,7,9,10,13,33) APL's fundamental design features allow for consistent and efficient annotation of VWD, and may be broadly applied in future research to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and fidelity of medical waveform annotation and classifier development.

Each breath is processed to generate clinically relevant metadata pertinent to the classification of VWD using ventMAP ( Figure 1 ).(1, 38) Examples of metadata generated include the inspiratory tidal volume (the volume delivered by the ventilator with each breath) and the expiratory time (the duration of each exhalation). All derived metadata were determined to be clinically relevant by four critical care clinicians (JYA, BTK, ICP, JN). Metadata are cached in a CSV file and then retrieved by Flask to generate a breath-level drop-up table that displays breath-specific metadata and annotation options. Display of metadata in a drop-up table mimics the user interface of a mechanical ventilator and was designed to facilitate use of APL by expert reviewers (Figure 2 ).",

Incorporation of quantitative and qualitative methods into a web-based visual annotation interface may reduce reviewer subjectivity in VWD classification, and enables efficient resolution of reviewer disagreements to generate gold standard data sets to drive classifier development. Using these methods, our team has annotated 318,676 dualadjudicated breaths for use in development of VM and PVA detection algorithms, which represents one of the largest existing collections of multi-reviewer annotated VWD. (1, 7, 15, 17, 39, 40) Historically, VWD annotation has been performed either by hand, use of electronic spreadsheets, and most recently by the web-based ExpertLabeler system.(41) A major limitation of these methods is that classifications are performed by visual criteria alone which are subject to high inter-rater bias due to reviewer subjectivity and local practice pattern. (17) APL addresses this limitation with the development of methods to support the simultaneous use of waveform morphology and metadata derived from VWD in classification decisions. To our knowledge, no MV-specific annotation package exists that is able to compute breath level metadata, display it on-screen, and allow multi-reviewer annotation and adjudication of events.",

(26, (46) (47) (48) (49) Our work is limited by use of data and clinicians from a single center, and APL is presently limited to processing VWD from a single ventilator. Future work will generalize APL's data processing capabilities to other ventilators and medical devices by exploring the use of emerging waveform encoding standards. (51) In addition, APL has only been used by four clinicians to date and further modifications may be required to meet the needs of other researchers. Changes to APL may also enable additional investigation into the reproducibility of waveform classification, and may facilitate the development of consensus guidelines for annotating VWD. (17, 52, 53) To promote further research, we have freely released our code on GitHub so that the wider research community may modify our work.",

In order to create generalizable datasets, researchers will also need consensus definitions for MVrelated phenomena. To satisfy these needs we developed APL, the first open-source, multireviewer MV visualization and annotation platform that allows for the use of multi-epoch annotation to speed the classification process, customizable annotation views to constrain and standardize class assignments, reconciliation of inter-rater classification disagreements, and the simultaneous display of waveform morphology and breath level metadata to reduce classification subjectivity. While APL is specific to MV, the concepts APL utilizes can be applied to other types of high volume, physiologic waveform data. In summary, APL represents a new, effective tool to improve the consistency and speed of generating multi-reviewer gold-standard VWD datasets that will help drive the development of novel CDS systems.",

Data were collected from Puritan Bennet Model 840 TM (PB-840) ventilators (Covidien, Dublin, Republic of Ireland) and stored in multiple sequential files up to two hours in length.(34,35) APL uses an open source stack including: ventMAP software for extraction of waveform metadata, the Python Flask web framework, the JavaScript library Dygraphs for graphing of VWD, Redis for storage, and Docker for APL deployment.(1,36,37) APL's source code and install instructions are available on GitHub for modification or use of APL.",
