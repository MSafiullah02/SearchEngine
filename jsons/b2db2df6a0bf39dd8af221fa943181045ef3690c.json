CT scan is required before considering emergency surgery for acute appendicitis. CT-scan was called for in order to diagnose acute appendicitis in accordance with current recommendations (2) . As the patient's appendix appeared normal, the examination highlighted the inaccuracy of the original, provisional diagnosis ( Figure 1 ). The radiology team then decided to obtain images of the thorax and changed the diagnosis to one of covid-19 ( Figure 2) (3). The patient was not operated. Abdominopelvic CT-scan. Normal appendix (arrow).",

During this pandemic period, it is important to consider it as a possible diagnosis, even in the event of an abdominal pain syndrome suggesting acute appendicitis. Screening for a co-infection prior to emergency surgery can modify the patient circuit and lead to reassessment of the therapeutic proposal. In some cases, it may even yield a differential diagnosis necessitating not surgery, but pronouncedly different medical treatment.A 63-year-old female patient having had an ischemic stroke and with AHT history, non-insulindependent diabetes and a BMI of 45, presented in an emergency department for abdominal pain during a period of SRAS-CoV-2 pandemic. The pain evolved for 4 days, occasionally associated with diarrheal stools. A single vomiting episode was reported. Prior to arrival in emergency, her temperature at home was 38.1\u00b0.Rendered difficult due to plethoric abdomen, clinical examination localized the febrile abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa. No extra-digestive manifestations or signs of respiratory distress syndrome was reported. The hemodynamic constants were normal, as was the patient's temperature on admission to emergency. Biological analysis objectified a moderate inflammatory syndrome with CRP at 89 and 5900 GB (absence of leucopenia and lymphopenia).",
