            "text": "Telocytes (TCs) have been found widely spreaded in a large number of organs and tissues of mammals, including atrial and ventricular myocardium, bladder, lung skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract, eyes, and others. TCs communicate with neighboring cells by homo- and heterocellular contacts and transfer genetic information and signaling molecules to influence other cells [1, 2]. Shoshkes-Carme et al. [3] recently demonstrated that TCs can be the major source of Wnt signaling, and play dependent roles in proliferation of intestinal stem cells and epithelial renewal. This particular study provides solid evidence that forkhead box L1-positive TCs contribute to the formation of the subepithelial plexus of the intestine, support the entire epithelium, and provide niche signals to intestinal stem cells, by producing Wnt ligands and maintaining Wnt signal pathway. Although TCs are often allocated within the stem cell niche, pulmonary TCs have different genetic profiles and biological functions from stem cells, fibroblasts, alveolar type II cells, airway basal cells, proximal airway cells, and T cells from bronchial lymph nodes or from lungs, respectively [4\u20137]. TCs functionally and constructively support and connect tissue cells, function as signal massage carriers, and benefit gene and cell therapies [8\u201312].",

With rapid development of gene editing technology, the precision and efficacy of gene modification are improved significantly [13, 14]. Safety profiles of gene modification as part of limitations require more preclinical and clinical evidence. The present study investigates potential effects of gene modification on morphological phenomes, biological behaviors and functions, as well as responses to inflammation in lung TCs. An anti-aging gene from Simian vacuolating virus 40 was transferred as the target gene into primary TCs isolated from mouse lungs to improve the longevity of cells, since primary TCs hardly survive in the in vitro system for a few weeks or months [5\u20137].",

Lung TCsSV40 were mainly located in cell cycle phases of S and G2, while primary lung TCs in sub-G1 phase (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, Fig. 5c demonstrates the alterations of cell cycle phases of Lung TCsSV40 compared with primary lung TCs. We found that the number of proliferation (Fig. 6b1\u2013c1) or differentiated TCsSV40 (Fig. 6b3) significantly decreased in LPS administration at 1 or 0.1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. LPS at 1 \u03bcg/ml caused a significant cell death (Fig. 6b2). Administration with SB216763 significantly inhibited the cell death (Fig. 6b2) or differentiated number (Fig. 6b3) of TCsSV40 treated with LPS at doses of 1.0 or 0.1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, while could prevented LPS high dose-decreased proliferating as well as induced cell death (Fig. 6c1, c2).

Figure 7 demonstrates that the ratio of TCsSV40 proliferation, death, and dividing after cells were challenged with vehicle or TNF\u03b1 at different concentrations of 0.2, 20, or 200 \u03bcg/ml and treated with vehicle, SB216763 or LY294002. The number of proliferating cells significantly reduced 48 h after administration with TNF\u03b1 at doses of 200 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 7b1, c1).

            "text": "TCs play an important role in the occurrence and progression of acute and chronic lung injury, asthma, and lung cancer [1, 10, 12], responsible for the highest mortality and morbidity of patients. TCs can directly communicate with a large number of cells within organ and contribute to tissue repair and regeneration, as potential alternative of cell therapies [10]. We initially isolated and purified TCs from human lung and airway tissues [16], and defined the special identity and genomic phenomes of lung TCs, different from lung stem cells, fibroblasts, alveolar type II cells, airway basal cells, proximal airway cells, CD8+ T cells from bronchial lymph nodes, and CD8+ T cells from lungs [4, 5, 17]. Our previous studies have proved the independence and specificity of human lung TCs at genomic levels and proposed TCs as a major source to connect cells, e.g. between TCs per se, or between TCs with other cells. The immunocytochemical markers of TCs include CD34, vimentin, c-kit, CD34/c-kit, CD34/vimentin, or PDGFR\u03b1 [3, 10, 16, 17]. The specificity of TCs and telocytes-specific biomarkers for the identification are still to be furthermore defined, since there are a large number of telocyte heterogeneities on source, preparation, pathway, duration, and measurable variables. There are obvious differences of TCs among tissues and organs, dependent upon biological functions and characters of TC-connected tissues and organs. TCs in lung have the specificity of connection with air\u2013liquid epithelial cells, tolerance to movement and pressure, and flexibility among barriers. In order to overcome those limits and difficulties, the present study develops a mouse lung telocyte cell-line by gene editing with lentivirus particles containing the anti-aging gene from Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) gene. In the present study, we found morphology, immune biomarkers, and ultrastructure of SV40-positive TCs are similar and coincident with those of primary TCs directly isolated from mouse lungs or cultured for days. Dynamic observations of bio-behaviors demonstrated that TCsSV40 proliferation obviously increased, rather than cell movement. The capability of TCs SV40 proliferation declined by increased consecutive passages and became more stable at the 50th passage, which was still significantly higher than the primary TCs. TCsSV40 provides a repeatable and stable cell tool for deep investigation of biological roles.",

SV40 as a polyomavirus with icosahedral capsids of 45 nm and a 5.25 kb-long circular double-stranded DNA can replicate in macaques as its natural host, leading to chronic asymptomatic infections. SV40 small and large T antigen was transduced using lentivirus to immortalize primary cells [18]. SV40 has been strongly considered as a clinical candidate of gene delivery, replacement, or therapy, due to the lack of immunogenicity in humans and capacity to induce immune tolerance to transgene proteins. Toscano et al. [19] used the current SV40 vector genome to generate Vero-based packaging cell vector particles and expresses a large amount of the SV40 large T antigen. It indicates that SV40 delivery can be an approach or alternative of clinical gene therapy. In the present study, mouse lung TCs were transduced and immortalized with a sequence of SV40 small and large T antigen in lentivirus. Excepted for increased capability of cell proliferation, we found that morphology, measured biomarkers, movement, and ultrastructure of TCsSV40 are the same as primary TCs directly harvested from lungs. However, we did find a number of gene expression in TCsSV40 were different from primary TCs, although the meaning and values of altered gene expression profiles in TCsSV40 remain unclear.",

Although the aim of the present study to establish a mouse lung telocyte cell-line for deeply understanding molecular mechanisms of TCs, it should be aware the regulation and translational ethics of preclinical activities for the genome editing [20]. Gene-edited TCs in the present study do not need to perform the large-scale cross-platform comparisons of safety and specificity of those edited TCs as discussed for the potential of clinical applications [21], while we noticed a clear off-target effects of mouse lung TCs on the survival time and passage of TCs. The second passage of TCsSV40 had the strongest capacity of cell proliferation, while such capacity declined with the increase of telocyte passage. We found the characterizations of phenomes and functions of TCsSV40 were more stable between consecutive passages 5 and 30. Our finding is similar to the report from Taciak et al. [22] that the phenotype and functional stability of the RAW 264.7 cell line were evaluated from the 5th to 50th passage and suggested the RAW 264.7 cell line could remain stable between 10th and 30th passage. Both studies strongly suggest that it should be extremely careful to apply more than the 30th passage of the telocyte cell-line and RAW 264.7 cell line for preclinical research, in order to avoid the questions of data reliability.",

We selected LPS as a stimulus of infection and inflammation and TNF\u03b1 as an inflammatory mediator at different concentrations treated with or without signal pathway inhibitors and found the proliferative capacity of TCsSV40 declined with an increased concentration of LPS or TNF\u03b1, similar to responses of primary TCs [23]. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a family of related intracellular signal transducer enzymes to phosphorylate the 3-position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol, perform cellular functions (e.g. cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival), and regulate cell responses to drug therapy [24]. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase to regulate the addition of phosphate molecules onto serine and threonine amino acid residues, carry out biological function (e.g. cellular proliferation, migration, glucose regulation, and apoptosis), and help cellular reprogramming for clinical cartilage repair [25]. TCsSV40 were sensitive to therapeutic effects of both PI3K and GSK3 inhibitors on prevention of LPS or TNF\u03b1-reduced proliferation. Of those pathways, GSK3 seems more dominate in telocyte response to challenges. However, more basic and pre-clinical studies are still needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of gene-edited cells before clinical application. Standard and strict application for clinical research ethics must be carried out before the implementation of clinical research. We suggest that lung TCsSV40 can be applied for further studies to understand molecular mechanisms by which TCs communicate with other cells.",
