In cases where the child was admitted to a RCH ward post ED discharge, basic hospitalisation data will also be collected, including; primary and secondary diagnoses, length of stay, clinical investigation data and respiratory medicine consultations.

As the prevalence of persistent cough amongst children with ARI is unknown, an estimated prevalence of 50% was used for sample size calculation to produce the highest estimate. To address the primary objective and detect a prevalence of 50% per year (\u03b1=0.05 and 95% confidence interval) assuming a 30% loss-to-follow-up, an annual minimum of 500 children with complete data at day 28 is required.

This definition is consistent with both prior research [8,14,15] and the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for evaluating cough in children [19]. A break in cough of greater than 3 consecutive days was incorporated into our definition to ensure that children who recover but subsequently become unwell with a second cough illness are not misclassified as having chronic cough. The continued participation of children until day 28 regardless of cough persistence will elicit data on the frequency of cough reoccurrence post ARI recovery and allows a more comprehensive comparison of children who do and do not continue to cough during the follow-up period.",

The collection of bilateral anterior nasal swabs on all study children will identify viral and bacterial pathogens associated with ARI and cough at both the time of ED presentation and specialist review. An extended panel of known respiratory pathogens (previously discussed) was chosen to ensure that pathogens excluded from routine respiratory PCR testing in the ED were included for analysis and contribute to the literature on pathogens for which the association between nasal detection and clinical illness is still being explored (e.g. polyomaviruses) [32].
