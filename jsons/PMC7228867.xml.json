            "text": "Gene therapy is designed to introduce genetic material into the cells of patients to compensate faulty genes or deliver therapeutic transgenes. Over the past three decades, gene therapy has progressed from initial human gene transfer experiments to approved clinical therapies [1]. Successful gene therapy trials have led to approval of a number of gene therapy products by drug regulation bodies across Europe and the USA. These include Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec), a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) product for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in 2012 [2], and Exondys51 (eteplirsen), an antisense oligonucleotide compound to restore the reading frame in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2016 [3]. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gene therapy product, Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec), which is an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy for the inherited retinal disease RPE65-associated Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis (LCA) [4], marking an historic landmark in gene therapy for eye diseases. Since the efficacy and safety of AAV-based gene therapy for hereditary eye diseases has been established in clinical trials, interest has grown in the use of gene therapy to treat complex polygenic eye disorders such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is an increasingly prevalent chronic condition with complex pathogenesis that is incompletely understood. Gene therapy interventions could potentially provide longer-term treatment with fewer side effects than current therapeutics; however, there are still several barriers to overcome before such a DR treatment could reach clinical trials. This review will provide an overview of the development of gene therapies for DR.",

Severe stages of DR include proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), resulting from abnormal growth of new retinal blood vessels, and diabetic macular edema (DME), where retinal vascular leakage and edema occur in the central part of the retina [5]. It is estimated that there are 17 million and 21 million patients with PDR and DME, respectively [6]. With an increased prevalence of diabetes from 415 million in 2015 to nearly 642 million by 2040, the prevalence of DR is expected to rise accordingly [7].",

Although these treatments are available, no treatment is yet to fully attenuate clinical progression to reverse damage to the retina. Our previous review detailed several canonical biochemical pathways triggered by hyperglycemia in DR [8]. Despite microcirculatory impairment traditionally being regarded as the main feature of DR, emerging evidence clearly shows retinal neurodegeneration occurring before clinical signs of DR, with subsequent microvascular dysfunction [9\u201311]. A growing body of evidence highlights the significant role of retinal neuronal dysfunction and death in DR, causing functional deficits such as decreased dark adaptation, contrast sensitivity, color perception, and visual field [10, 12, 13].",

            "text": "Treatment for both DME and PDR has been revolutionized by the availability of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. Such agents bind VEGF therefore preventing VEGF pathway and suppressing neovascularization [29]. However, there are shortcomings with regard to variable response to therapy and lack of efficacy in a subgroup of patients. VEGF is an evident therapeutic target for DR gene therapy studies. Various experiments have attempted to interfere in the intraocular VEGF pathway, both extra- and intracellularly. sFlt-1, a soluble splice variant of the VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1 or Flt-1), acts as a decoy VEGF receptor in the extracellular space, and has been investigated as a potential target to suppress retinal neovascularization in experimental animal models [19, 22, 23, 26, 28, 30]. Flt23k, an anti-VEGF intraceptor, is a recombinant construct of VEGF binding domains 2 and 3 of VEGFR-1 coupled with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal sequence lysine-aspartic acid-glutamic acid-leucine (KDEL) [29]. Flt23k can thus intervene VEGF pathways and degrade VEGF intracellularly. A study reported a clear reduction of choroidal neovascularization in an animal model after injection of AAV-mediated Flt23k, providing indirect evidence of potential of AAV-Flt23k in impeding retinal neovascularization [31]. Future studies targeting VEGF with AAV as a delivery vector should examine its efficacy and safety in animal models with DR. Other strategies, such as the injection of siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting VEGF, have also showed an effective reduction of VEGF expression, inhibiting retinal neovascularization in animals in early days of gene therapy [21].",

A study using AAV to deliver PEDF in the retina demonstrated decreased VEGF levels and reduced expression of angiogenesis-related fibrosis factors, such as matrix metalloproteinases and connective tissue growth factor in transgenic mice designed to develop progressive neovascularization [18]. Angiostatin is a fragment of plasminogen with the capability of inhibiting endothelial proliferation [32]. In a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), a rodent model of retinal neovascularization, lentiviral vector-encoded angiostatin was shown to be a potent inhibitor of neovascularization, although therapeutic safety was not examined [25]. Like angiostatin, endostatin is proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII and a potential therapeutic target for neovascularization owing to its antiangiogenic properties [33]. An earlier study injecting endostatin molecules in animals exposed to OIR showed a marked decrease of VEGF and integrin \u03b23 levels, both of which are strongly related to angiogenesis [34]. In addition, retinal vascular architecture has been partly preserved in those mice injected with AAV expressing endostatin [17]. Retinal transduction of AAV encoding other endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors such as tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-3 or CAD has also been found to reduce retinal neovascularization in OIR mice [16, 27].",

A critical in vitro study conducted 4 years earlier showed evidence of siRNA-induced off-target effects, generating a measurable phenotype [61]. Published clinical trial data for the treatment of AMD using bevasiranib produced consistent short-term outcomes, but the lack of long-term endpoints means the lasting efficacy of this treatment is not yet established. Compared with none of clinical trials for gene therapy for DR, there are several closed and ongoing trials designed for wet AMD where AAV is used as the delivery vector. Previous gene therapy trials for wet AMD were discontinued due to inconsistent efficacy, but importantly, they reported no safety concerns [62]. The understanding of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease amenable to gene therapy has advanced significantly with time. Improvements in viral vectors, better selection of transgenes, refined surgical skills to deliver vectors and advanced outcome measures may improve outcomes in future clinical trials for non-inherited eye diseases.",

In contrast to many gene therapies in clinical trials that target monogenic eye disease, DR is a polygenetic and relatively heterogeneous disorder. This means gene therapy for DR may need to target a variety of gene candidates that are implicated in the pathogenesis of DR. Additionally, DR is a progressive disease with several staging classifications based on the severity of the symptoms over the disease course, which convolutes patient selection criteria. Furthermore, it may not be appropriate for participants with the same clinical classification to undertake the same therapy given the diverse range of genetic polymorphisms that can contribute to a similar clinical picture. This complexity starkly differs from the relative simplicity of the pathogenesis of LCA, an inherited retinal dystrophy attributable to mutations in a single gene, RPE65, with clinical features evident from birth and for which there is currently gene therapy commercially available [63]. The complicated pathogenesis of DR contributes to the difficulty of creating an appropriate animal model, which further hinders the translation of gene therapy research for this condition.",

Over the past two decades, studies have increasingly used AAV instead of adenovirus or lentivirus in both basic and clinical research of gene therapy for eye diseases. Compared with other viral vectors, AAV is less immunogenic and only a small portion undergoes genome integration, although major limitations include its relatively small transgene packaging capacity and high cost for clinical-grade manufacturing (Table 4). Our previous review has detailed the differences between these vector modalities [8]. AAV2 is currently the most-used viral vector in gene therapy clinical trials; however, its transduction efficacy in the retina is limited, and its target cell-type depends on the administration route due to physical and cellular barriers; for example, photoreceptors are transduced via subretinal injection whilst ganglion cells are transduced via intravitreal injection [64]. M\u00fcller cells, a key source of VEGF expression in DME and PDR, cross through all layers of retina, which are not well transduced by AAV2 with ubiquitous promoters, such as cytomegalovirus, chicken \u03b2-actin or cytomegalovirus early enhancer/chicken \u03b2-actin [8]. Glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, a glial cell-specific promoter that modulates transgene expression in AAV2, has been demonstrated to target M\u00fcller cells specifically and to supress retinal neovascularization significantly in OIR models [17].",

In contrast to conventional AAV, self-complementary AAV (scAAV) encompasses an inverted repeat gene sequence that is able to fold into a section of double-stranded DNA without the synthesis of a second DNA strand. An in vitro study showed the transduction efficacy of scAAV is 5- to 140-fold higher than conventional AAV [67].

Other approaches to regulate transgene expression may include specific enhancer or responding elements incorporated in the expression cassette, for instance enhancers bound to transcription factors upregulated during active DR progression, such as HIF-1 [72].

The outcome measures recorded need to be optimized according to the specific molecular target location within the eye.
