Transplantation of porcine organs has become an increasingly attractive approach as CRISPR/cas9 genome editing techniques have succeeded in reducing the rejection rate of transplanted organs.1 Transmission of infectious disease during transplantation is always a concern, and allogenic transplantation is associated not only with the reactivation of opportunistic infections from the recipient, but also infectious agents present in the donor tissue that is transmitted to the immunosuppressed hosts.2, 3 In the case of xenotransplantation, transmission of zoonotic infections, such as hepatitis E virus (HEV), or porcine infectious agents that might gain access to the human host during transplantation is an additional concern.4, 5 At present, the full spectrum of infectious agents with the potential for transmission to the human host, or that might produce pathology in transplanted porcine organs, has not been completely defined, but will improve over time. Going forward, ensuring the safety of these organs is of paramount importance, and the use of highly sensitive techniques to detect potential pathogens will help to minimize adverse events in xenotransplantation.",

A description of sequences targeted by each of the assays is shown in Table S1 and includes the sequence of all the primers and probes, the accession numbers from cognate agents, and genomic coordinates. Each plasmid contains multiple targets as well as sequences for herpes simplex virus (HSV) to facilitate the absolute quantification of each plasmid by a validated assay in a clinical laboratory by established primers and methods.16 Plasmids were synthesized, cloned, and sequenced by a commercial supplier to yield qualified stocks of target sequences (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Target sequences were concatenated to produce a single DNA sequence from multiple organisms, synthesized, and cloned into pUCIDT to yield control clones carrying the following sets of target sequences: pMP638, HSV, porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and porcine parvovirus (PPV); pMP639, HSV, norovirus genogroup II (Noro2), West Nile virus (WNV), bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); pMP640, HSV, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), seneca valley A virus (SVA), porcine reproductive, and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRV); pMP645, HSV, HEV, reovirus 3 (REO3), porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus 1 (PLHV1), and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus 3 (PLHV3); pMP646, HSV, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus 2 (PLHV2), porcine astrovirus (ASTV), sapovirus (Sapo), and human influenza B virus (IFB); pMP647, HSV, PCMV, porcine adenovirus (PAdV), mycoplasma haemofelis group (MycoF), mycoplasma haemominutum group (MycoM), porcine endogenous retrovirus C (PERV\u2010C), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV); and pMP652, HSV lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), rabies virus (RabV), swine influenza (IFA), reovirus 1 (Reo1), reovirus 2 (Reo2), and rotavirus (Rota). Each of the plasmids was diluted to yield control solutions with a low copy number and were quantified in a clinical laboratory by a quantitative qPCR assay used to measure viral loads in clinical specimens. The absolute copy number of target DNA in each of the solutions was further adjusted such that the copy numbers of all the plasmids were equivalent and again experimentally confirmed by the HSV qPCR assay in the clinical laboratory. Finally, the control solutions were mixed in an equimolar ratio to produce a control solution that served as a quantitative control for all the targets described above.",

Also, as the nucleic acids were prepared in the clinical laboratory, the samples were not spiked with influenza B virus, and as a consequence, the IFB controls were also negative as expected. Notably, none of the assays for porcine viruses detected any of the viruses in the human specimens. For instance, the primers for the porcine herpesviruses PCMV, PLHV1, PLHV2, and PLHV3 did not amplify any of the human herpesvirus sequences in the specimens including HSV, HCMV, VZV, EBV, or HHV6 even though two of the specimens tested contained more than 109 and 107 copies/ml of VZV and HSV, respectively.

It is also limited by the relatively small number of animals we described in detail in this report. However, the subsequent evaluation of more than 300 additional specimens has resulted in the detection of most of the targets including SVA, Noro, IFA, REO1, PHEV, PLHV1, PLHV2, PLHV3, PRRS, Rota, PCV1, PCV2, BVDV, PCMV, PADV, MycoF, MycoM, PERV\u2010C, P\u2010CYP, and specimens spiked with the EMCV. The detection of these targets in pig specimens provides reassurance that the analytical methods are functioning as designed, and there is no a priori reason why some targets might be more difficult to detect than others with the methods described here. Importantly, these data and the data in Table 3 also help document the analytical specificity of each of the assays in the infectious disease panel for porcine specimens; each specimen is evaluated with 30 separate assays for different viruses in parallel so the detection of one positive target typically occurs together with negative results for the remaining 29 targets. Ideally, the assay validation process would be similar to that used for assays for human viruses that are in clinical use and have been described in reports of clinical trials.17, 42 Continued efforts to evaluate large numbers of porcine specimens is expected to yield positive samples for most of these targets and will be valuable reagents as validation studies continue.",

As this assay is largely automated, it is possible for an individual to evaluate at least 30 specimens per day with this panel, and the assays could also be easily multiplexed by the addition of different fluorescent labels to the probes or coded sequences to the primers. The flexibility that this approach affords will be important moving forward as information on potential risks improves, and more targets are added to the set of agents described in this work. Nonetheless, the panel reported herein promises to provide data to enhance the safety of porcine tissues for xenotransplantation and will also be valuable in the evaluation of human specimens following xenotransplantation.",

A set of plasmids containing each of the target nucleic acid sequences was subjected to a set of 2\u2010fold dilutions to yield the absolute copy number shown on the horizontal axis of each XY plot. Each dilution was quantified in six separate experiments, and the average copy number was calculated and shown on the vertical axis of each plot with error bars representing the standard deviation values. Most assays yielded linear relationships with low standard deviation values and slopes approaching 1.0; however, some of the assays did not perform to a level required for quantitative assays including WNV, Noro, and Rota in panels A, E, and F, respectively. The assays for these three viruses did prove to be highly sensitive and are good qualitative assays. While most of the assays yielded similar amplification characteristics, differences in the specific amplification efficiencies can contribute to differences in both the slope and Y\u2010intercept for some of the assays",
