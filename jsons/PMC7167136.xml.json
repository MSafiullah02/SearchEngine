In addition to the widely used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010based detection, numerous amplification techniques were designed (Guatelli et al. 1990). Examples of popular methods used are nucleic acid sequence\u2010based amplification (Malek et al. 1994), self\u2010sustained sequence replication (3SR; Fahy et al. 1991) and strand displacement amplification (SDA; Walker et al. 1992). Each of these methods has a different set of requirements to initiate DNA synthesis. For instance, PCR involves heat to denature the double\u2010stranded target DNA into single\u2010stranded to initiate DNA synthesis. SDA uses strand displacement action of exo\u2010klenow to produce target DNA copies from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 and the procedure occurs at a single temperature (Walker et al. 1992). These methods are widely used in all fields of science to amplify the target sequence. However, they still suffer from insufficiencies and inadequacies. All these methods require a sophisticated instrument for amplification and detection or elaborate methods for performance (Fang et al. 2008). As a result, researchers and scientists have worked hard to overcome these limitations.",

The sample of interest, for example, saliva, blood, urine and other body fluids, is applied at one end of the strip (sample pad), which is conjugated with LAMP buffer mix and biotin, making the loaded sample suitable for interaction with the detection system. Most generally, lateral flow test was established using fluorescein in isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled DNA probes (which will recognize the specific region in the LAMP amplicon) hybridized with biotinylated LAMP amplicons (Thongkao et al. 2015; Fowler et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2017; Park et al. 2017). This complex would be captured by streptavidin on the biotin, forming another complex with anti\u2010FITC antibody coated on the gold nanoparticles. This would give a visible result on the test line. However, the biotinylated nontargeted product would not hybridize with FITC DNA probe (only specific to LAMP amplicon), nor forming complexes with gold\u2010labelled anti\u2010FITC antibody to react with streptavidin on the test line, generating no signal thus a negative result on the test line.

Furthermore, the product of LAMP results in a ladder pattern or smearing on the gel rather than a single band as in PCR, thus identification of a target by size of the band on a gel is not possible with LAMP (Wastling et al. 2010).",

Developing a mobile biosensor with LAMP technology application may result in a significant advancement. To date, LAMP was widely used as a diagnostic tool for the detection of human, livestock and plant diseases. However, there are few publications on the use of this technique for the direct detection of environmental pathogens. The development of a sensor that can detect the presence of pathogenic pathogens directly from an environmental sample may bring vast benefits, especially in diseases that are caused by environmental pathogens, such as Leptospirosis. Apart from that, LAMP could also be applied in the early detection of genetic diseases in a foetus, for instance, Down syndrome and thalassemia, as it has high specificity. The development of microfluidic devices with LAMP also comes with many advantages, such as easy to operate, palm\u2010sized, high output applicability, decrease in the consumption of expensive reagents and do not require electricity. LAMP microfluidic devices are commonly developed for food testing, cancer screening and virus detection. In summary, all of the features of LAMP prove that its straightforwardness is beneficial for the on\u2010site field or diagnostics in an everyday basis in a POC setting.",

LAMP is also a beneficial and valuable tool for use in developing countries due to its ease of performance without needing any advanced equipment or experts to operate it. In summary, LAMP could be the ideal diagnostic method, as it fulfils all criteria proposed by the WHO on ideal diagnostics.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Schematic representation of LAMP reaction and its principle. LAMP reaction involved reaction mixture consists of dNTPs mix, Bst polymerase, fluorescence dye, primers and DNA template. Primer design: Design of primer for LAMP reaction and is characterized by the use of four different primers specially designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target DNA. Forward Inner Primer (FIP) consists of a F2 region at the 3'\u2010end and an F1c region at the 5'\u2010end; Forward Outer Primer (F3 Primer) consists of a F3 region which is complementary to the F3c region of the template sequence; Backward Inner Primer (BIP) consists of a B2 region at the 3'\u2010end and a B1c region at the 5'\u2010end. Backward Outer Primer (B3 Primer) consists of a B3 region which is complementary to the B3c region of the template sequence. LAMP reaction: The amplification starts when F2 region of FIP hybridizes to F2c region of the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis, follow by F3 primer that hybridizes to the F3c region of the target DNA and extends, displacing the FIP linked complementary strand. This displaced strand forms a loop at the 5'\u2010end. This single\u2010stranded DNA with a loop at the 5'\u2010end then serves as a template for BIP. B2 hybridizes to B2c region of the template DNA. DNA synthesis is initiated leading to the formation of a complementary strand and opening of the 5'\u2010end loop. Subsequently, B3 hybridizes to B3c region of the target DNA and extends, displacing the BIP linked complementary strand. This results in the formation of a dumbbell\u2010shaped DNA. The nucleotides are added to the 3'\u2010end of F1 by Bst \nDNA polymerase, which extends and opens up the loop at the 5'\u2010end. The dumbbell\u2010shaped DNA now gets converted to a stem\u2010loop structure (refer a and b). This structure serves as an initiator for LAMP cycling, which is the second stage of the LAMP reaction. Loop primers can be added as well for exponential amplification of LAMP. The final products obtained are a mixture of stem\u2010loop DNA with various stem lengths and various cauliflower\u2010like structures with multiple loops. Fig. 1 was modified from Notomi et al.
