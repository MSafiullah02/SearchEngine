A general understanding of COVID-19 characteristics in this population is urgently needed to inform management guidelines and identify high-risk individuals during the pandemic.",

Despite the recognised track-record of high-quality observational drug safety research in rheumatology within multiple national biological registries,8 immediate data on COVID-19-specific outcomes would need to be collected to address this demand. Therefore, the international rheumatology community mobilised at an unprecedented pace to create the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance. In less than 1 week, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance successfully developed online portals and case report forms to enable health-care providers around the world to enter information on individuals with rheumatic disease who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.",

Duplicate entries might occur across different providers, although our data analytics teams carefully examine and address data quality on a regular basis. Also, despite including individuals from across the world, specific adjusted analyses might not be possible due to sample size. Finally, as the whole denominator of individuals with rheumatic diseases who acquire COVID-19 is unknown, the database will be unable to provide accurate estimates of the risk of specific outcomes across the entire rheumatic disease population or in association with specific treatments. With time, existing patient registries and administrative databases will provide these data, but likely not until the current pandemic has ended, thus strengthening the current and critical role of this database.",
