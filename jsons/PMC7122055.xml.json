As early as the fourth century BCE, Herodotus wrote of Scythian archers dipping their arrows into the decomposing cadavers of humans and snakes prior to firing them at their enemies. The intentional use of smallpox as a weapon of war against Native Americans was historically attested during the French and Indian War. Organized biowarfare programs, with full knowledge of Koch\u2019s postulates and the germ theory of disease, began on a small scale during the First World War but expanded dramatically during the interwar years and into the Second World War. The Japanese imperial government is known to have released pathogens directly over regions of China, while Nazi Germany performed human experimentation into biowarfare but did not appear to have utilized them in combat [2].",

Despite the BWC, however, nations continued to conduct research into bioweapons, as demonstrated by the accidental 1979 release of Bacillus anthracis in the town of Sverdlovsk in Russia [3]. In more recent years, non-state entities, such as rogue individuals, cults, and terrorist movements, have come to play a larger role in the use of bioterrorism, most notably the intentional mailing of B. anthracis spores in the United States in 2001 [4].",

Gastrointestinal anthrax is highly lethal, with necrosis developing throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract with resulting pain, fever, nausea, dysentery, visceral perforation, and sepsis. In the oropharyngeal form, pseudomembranes are seen in the oropharynx, and upper airway obstruction can develop.

The typical clinical course of inhalational anthrax is biphasic, with an initial nonspecific syndrome including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and myalgia that may resemble a typical viral respiratory infection. After 2\u20133 days, severe illness follows, with hemorrhagic mediastinitis, respiratory failure, and shock [14]. Mediastinal widening and large pleural effusions are common findings; airspace opacities on chest radiography are less frequent, although a hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonitis has been noted on autopsy\nspecimens [15]. Clinically significant pericardial effusions and ascites occurred in 17% and 21% of victims in the Sverdlovsk outbreak, respectively, and may require drainage [16].

After entering the body through a fleabite,\nbacteria migrate via cutaneous lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes. After evading host defenses, Y. pestis replicates within lymph nodes, with the resulting lymphadenitis producing the signature lesion known as the \u201cbubo.\u201d Most buboes develop in the groin, axilla, or neck. These enlarged lymph nodes are necrotic and contain dense\nconcentrations of bacteria [48, 49]. Endotoxin and other virulence factors subsequently contribute to disease progression, bacteremia, sepsis, and often death [35\u201337, 50\u201354]. Patients with suspected bubonic plague should be managed with strict contact precautions, including the\nuse of gowns, gloves, and surgical masks by clinical staff (Fig 6.3).\n",

In Europe, the incidence of\ntularemia is considerably higher, with over 1000 cases per year in Hungary and the Czech Republic and over 4000 cases per year in Sweden and Finland.

Based on the site of\ninitial infection and presenting syndrome, tularemia may be described as primary pneumonic, typhoidal, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, or septic. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common form of the infection, typically following with a week of a vector bite or animal contact. A majority of patients present with fever (85%), with chills (52%), headache (45%), cough (38%), and myalgias (31%) occurring in many. Other nonspecific constitutional symptoms occur with variable frequency, such as chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The hallmark lesion is a tender papule at the site of initial inoculation which subsequently ulcerates, with painful enlarged\nlymphadenopathy proximal to the ulcer. This lesion may clinically resemble a plague bubo, and plague must be considered in the differential diagnosis. A purely \u201cglandular\u201d form, with lymphadenopathy but no visible ulcer, can occur as well. In cases of ingestion of contaminated material, an exudative pharyngitis and tonsillitis may develop, with subsequent pharyngeal ulceration and cervical lymphadenopathy. Inoculation of the eye will lead to oculoglandular tularemia, also with accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy. Cases of systemic tularemia without clinically apparent lymphadenopathy are known as typhoidal tularemia. Fever, diarrhea, shock, and meningeal signs are typical (Figs. 6.5 and 6.6).\n\n",

Respiratory symptoms were absent in nearly half of patients in a recent series from Finland, however [78]. Pleural effusions are common and may be unilateral or bilateral. Pneumonic tularemia can progress rapidly to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, and eventually multiorgan failure [9, 74]. Virtually any organ may be involved in severe tularemia, including peritonitis, pericarditis,\nappendicitis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis, although such presentations are less frequent than the more \u201cclassic\u201d forms.
