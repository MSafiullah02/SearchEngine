However, there is already a POCT for a biomarker, namely C-Reactive protein (CRP), and there are no known other biomarkers that have better prognostic properties in this setting. A test to detect viral pathogens, which, if known by a treating clinician to be present, might rule out the need to prescribe antibiotics and might rule in the need for antiviral treatment, would be the next most useful test for enhancing the management of these presentations in primary care. During pandemics, viral identification becomes more important as targeted antiviral therapy may be recommended. For example, during the recent H1N1 pandemic, more people received oselatmivir than were infected with the virus in primary and secondary care. As with overuse of antibiotics, over-use of antiviral agents is associated with developing resistance. An etiological diagnosis can guide decisions about other aspects of management apart from pharmacological treatment such as the decision about whether or not patients need to be isolated, and can help patients and clinicians make plans in the light of improved prognostic information.",

In patients assessed in hospital with possible CAP, a rapid POCT could influence patient outcome by aiding prompt imitation of appropriate antibiotics, with a favourable impact on mortality, antibiotic resistance, and cost (e.g. shortening the length-of-stay, decreased antibiotic consumption). The sooner appropriate antibiotic treatment is started in patients with CAP, the better the outcomes for patients. At the present time, two broad-spectrum antibiotic agents are usually started empirically for patients with CAP. Clinical outcomes and impact on resistance may be improved by a POCT that guides more specific therapy from the start of treatment. POCTs could also guide steeping down treatment to narrower spectrum (but equally effective) agents after treatment has already been started.",

Patients with CA-LRTI showed 28-fold higher average loads of S. pneumoniae than colonised individuals. 13 Results (using nasopharyngeal swab samples) obtained with a semi-quantitative culture method showed good correlation with real-time PCR, although this study was small. However, it is difficult to clearly define an quantification threshold that differentiates invasive pneumococcal disease from colonisation and so the practical use of this measurement should be further evaluated. 14 Despite this, it should be considered that the prescription of antibiotics to a person 'colonised' rather than infected with S. pneumoniae is perhaps of less importance than the number of patients treated with antibiotics for a viral infection.
