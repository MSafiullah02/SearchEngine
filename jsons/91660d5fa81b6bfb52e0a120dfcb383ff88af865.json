Prediction about the number of infected and death cases may help to take immediate action to prevent the epidemic as well as control the situation of a country. The ongoing debate about the climate factors may need more validation with more studies. The climate factors of the top-five affected countries and three south Asian countries have considered in this study to have a real-time forecast and robust validation about the impact of climate variables. Methods: The ARIMA model have included to model the univariate cumulative confirmed and death cases separately. The MLP, ELM and likelihood-based GLM count time series also considered as they consider the external variables as exogenous regressors. As the death count includes zero itself, zero-inflated count time series model has included instead of likelihoodbased GLM. The better fitting of the ARIMA model will validate the under-whelm of meteorological factors was the initial hypothesis. The best model has identified through the application and comparison with the real data points.",

However, a few weeks later, it rapidly spread all over the globe as the humanto-human transmission is an often event in this era of the global village. So far the data on the date of May 8, 2020 reveal that 4,000,282 persons have infected across the world with 275,323 death and 48,455 critical severe cases where the proportion of total cases and penalties for each million population is 513.2 and 35.3 percent (Worldometer, 2020; WHO, 2020) . To control the outbreak of the pandemic, the identification and isolation of infected individuals or making social distance, are the most implemented methods since now. But the identification of the contact person is the most crucial part of this method; this is why the feasibility of making social distance home quarantine is also in a state of trepidation (Hellewell et al., 2020) .",

Until now, Italy, the USA, Spain, Germany, Iran, France, Switzerland, Iran, UK, and South Korea are the top affected countries after China, where most of them belong to the region of Europe. Among the top affected countries USA, Italy, Spain, France, and Iran are grappling the worst turmoil after the original one with an exponential increase of deaths. The novel coronavirus is similar to another epidemic named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but the total deaths and cases in COVID-19 already exceed multiple compared to the outbreaks of SARS in 2002 -2003 (Lai et al., 2020 WHO, 2020) . The outbreak of this pandemic influenced by several underlying factors. The debate of daily influences of the weather variables for the transmission of epidemic comes to an end after some recent studies. Moreover, the recent study indicates that wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity have a high correlation with the outbreak of the pandemic where another research specifies diurnal temperature is positively, and relative humidity is negatively associated with mortality or death count. Another study relates the climate variable with the doubling time where temperature show positive and evaporation show the inverse relationship (Oliveiros et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) . 3 When it comes to the point of forecasting the count, several methods were already applied to have real-time forecasting. The short-term forecasting methods include generalized logistic growth model, Richard model, and sub-epidemic wave model applied to the data of 34 areas, including provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities' cumulative cases in a current study (Roosa et al., 2020) . Another study uses the symmetric and Gauss function to identify and forecast the infected, suspected, and deaths in Hubei and China (Li et al., 2020) . Moreover, the use of modified auto-encoders forecasting (Hu et al., 2020) , several non-parametric model implementations in case of forecasting the spreading the pandemic at China, Italy, and France (Fanelli and Piazza, 2020) , and the application of ARIMA base models also noticed to have the forecast of the epidemic (Benvenuto et al., 2020) . All the mentioned study involves only the cumulative or infected case, new cases, and deaths of different province and country for forecasting, where most of the research goes through the univariate modeling approach.",

Among the machine learning algorithm, Multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) and Extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for time series forecasting have considered for making the comparison to other models. It needs to mention that the deep learning forecasting algorithms such as Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural network, also applied to forecast the epidemic. Still, the considered data for the individual country are small in volume, and the results also show a large quantity of error for the pilot study, which has no way to engage with included models. In contrast, the conventional Poisson and Negative-Binomial distribution base count time series models may be the most accurate way of presenting the analysis and forecasting as the projected data consist of the integer value. Besides, among the bunch of count time series models, likelihood-based generalized linear models with Poisson and Negative-Binomial conditional distribution is considered for this study, as it found usable in the literature compared to some recurrently used count time series model (Liboschik et al., 2017) . Conversely, handling the zero in count data is also an important task. The cumulative death data found for this study consist of many zero as initial days of pandemic do not report any death at most of the country. Thus, data-driven methods of count time series or zero-inflated model also included in the study for giving access to the zero in the forecasting.",

Among the machine learning algorithms, MLP seems to have better forecasting accuracy as MLP shows lower MSE for both confirm and death cases except France (see , Table 1 ). Machine learning (ML) is a procedure of learning from the data, and the learning scheme makes the difference between the algorithms. The distinction of algorithms through MSE or any other accuracy measurement may fail to identify the real one, as ML is a learning procedure from the data. Hence, there is a prerequisite for further demonstration for detecting the best algorithm.",

The idea of these types of models are available in the literature since the application count regression model, but the proposed data driven model of Yang, Zamba, and Canavag (Yang et al., 2013) gives new influence over the count time series modeling. Proposed method allows the probability () t W with a time varying GLM logit link and the conditional mean () t \uf06c is model through logistic regression model which also vary over time.

The univariate ARIMA model has considered for the comparison with no inclusion of external regressors.
