The harbinger of the third zoonotic coronavirus epidemic in as many decades [1], was Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, who died following infection with COVID-19 [2,3]. It was thought he was infected during examination of a patient with angle closure glaucoma in the second week of January 2020. He suspected an outbreak after seeing patients with SARS-like symptoms and the system failure to heed his warning may well have changed the course of world history. The second instructive case is that of the respiratory physician Guangfa Wang [4]. Days before pneumonia onset, his earliest symptoms related to left conjunctivitis, then catarrhal symptoms and fever which developed after 2\u20133 h, slower than might be expected from older studies tracing the passage of bacteria through the lacrimal drainage system [5]. While an N95 respirator was worn, offering protection from infection via oro-nasal pathways, eye protection was not.",

            "text": "Dr Li Wenliang's death and the apparent high infection rate in ophthalmologists (and ENT surgeons) [11], attributed to the high viral shedding from the nasal cavity, should not be unexpected. A high initial viral load is associated with poor prognosis [12] and ophthalmologists are particularly at risk, since ophthalmic practice involves very close ophthalmologist-patient physical proximity. This is necessitated by optical imperatives to optimise image quality by close alignment of imaging devices to the eye. Slit lamp biomicroscopy is the cornerstone of ophthalmic practice and the slit lamp is also used to carry out surgical procedures. The back focal distance (the distance of the subject from the front lens surface of the microscope), is set to give the surgeon sufficient space for manipulation \u223c 11 cm (Fig. 2\nA). With the instrument body length added, the distance from patient to the surgeon's eye is at a convenient working distance of \u223c28\u201330 cm. This proximity and the possibility of cross infection between examiner and examinee has long been recognized and a protective, transparent, typically Perspex\u00ae \u201cbreath shield\u201d was added to slit lamps. It is evident in slit lamps from as early as 1919 [13] and may well have gained popularity during the era of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The necessity for such shields is readily apparent from studies in which exposure between two face-to-face breathing manikins is measured [14] \u2013 Fig. 2b, Fig. 2c\nB and C. Tracer gas experiments to investigate the range of exhalation, either by mouth (2B\u2032) or nose (2C) show that at \u223c30 cm, one would be within the \u201cline of fire\u201d. This study concluded that air exhaled from human respiration contains contaminants and is able to penetrate the breathing zone of other nearby persons. Of interest is that exhalation flow may stratify in a horizontal layer at breathing zone height under certain conditions. Thus, with slit lamp examination, the layer of air between patient and ophthalmologist may remain stable, exposing both individuals for the entire time of the examination. Breath shields are often missing from slit lamps either because they are not fitted or because, as they get in the way, are removed.",

            "text": "That slit lamps and their accessory lenses are a source of infection transmission has long been known [15]. In epidemic adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis ((AKC), shipyard/eye hospital eye) [10,16], ophthalmologists are not infrequently infected although this is not well documented [17,18]. While AKC can cause considerable incapacity and has resulted in some risk-minimization measures, unlike coronavirus it does not usually result in death. The earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic resulted in recommendations for how to manage eye facilities and include advice in relation to slit lamp cleaning and eye protection for staff [19,20]. Slit lamp biomicroscopy is an almost optimal method of transferring material in breaths between two individuals, short of actual facial contact. A very recent study provides evidence for human-to-human transmission [21]. Pathways include direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission as well as contact transmission including contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes [22]. SARS-CoV-2 aerosol and fomite transmission is highly likely, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on different surfaces up to days [23]. While transmission of coronaviruses occurs via an airborne route [24], because infected, symptomatic patients tend to develop severe lower, as opposed to upper respiratory tract infections, it has been supposed that airborne agent virus has to be small enough to penetrate directly into the lower respiratory tract to preferentially replicate there before causing disease. That transmission could occur via the ocular-nasolacrimal pathway was not considered.",

            "text": "Human eyes are located at a coign of vantage in the body, simultaneously providing information from our highest bandwidth sense but also being exposed to risk of exposure including to airborne virus. The surface area of the eye(s) is large compared to that of the mouth and nares \u2013 (Fig. 2\nD) and was recognized early as a target for \u201cpromiscuous spraying\u201d whereby coughing could project material at least 10 feet away [5]. Since this 1919 study [5], a number of other studies have investigated ocular surface area and reported as a total (for two eyes) as 226\u2013426 [25] and 300\u2013640 mm2 [26], indicating that the figure from Maxcy's early study [5] was a good estimate (Table 1\n) of the \u201cvisible\u201d ocular surface. The later study [26] also explains variability in measurements, since palpebral aperture is dependent on eye gaze direction. However, the total ocular surface area has been estimated at \u223c1600\u20131869 sq. mm/eye [27,28], including the cornea, this representing a maximal absorptive area of \u223c3738 sq.mm, accounting for the tarsal conjunctiva and including the palpebral fornices. Even this consideration underestimates the potential ocular/periocular landing zone for a viral particle. It is not an uncommon observation that makeup, applied around the eye, can \u201cmigrate\u201d onto the ocular surface [29], similar to the phenomenon by which noxious agents in minute quantities are easily transferred from fingertip to periocular skin and then the eye. This may be due to subtle actions of Riolan's muscle [30]. In fact, this mechanism of transport of agents from the periocular eye lid skin to the eye (obviating the need for eyedrops) has been termed supracutaneous and has been developed as an efficient delivery system for management of dry eye syndrome [31]. This supracutaneous mechanism, might provide a substantial periocular area in which viral particles could land and be \u201cfunnelled\u201d onto the ocular surface and beyond. Table 1 provides available information on the size of the orbital opening (32 and reviewed in 33), which likely underestimates the area of eyelid skin. We have estimated eyelid skin to be \u223c4000 mm2 and that of the brow to be \u223c3000 mm2, so that in total with the ocular surface area, a landing site of \u223c10,000 mm2 would be available, \u2013 2 orders of magnitude greater than for the nares and mouth. This does not take into account the surface area that could be attributed to the hair of the eyebrows or the eyelashes, for which estimates have not been made. Eyelash aerodynamics may also play a role [34]. Eyelashes have been shown to divert airflows, acting as a passive ocular dust controlling system. They reduce evaporation and particle deposition up to 50%. In a comparative study [35], Asian eyelashes had lower lift-up and curl-up angles, fewer numbers and a thicker transverse diameter as compared to Caucasian eyelashes. Whether these differences play any role in influencing the rate at which particles land on the ocular surface is unknown. However, it is possible that a deficiency in this mechanism could increase the risk of infection.",

Efforts in directly targeting the ACE2 receptor in this way are limited [64]. Potentially, blocking the ACE2 receptor would deprive coronaviruses from their main point of tissue binding. P4 and P5 peptides and NAAE, a small molecule targeting ACE2 have been developed but there have been concerns about a narrow spectrum of activity and effects on blood pressure regulation [65]. This strategy has previously been employed, using antibodies [66] - anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication in a model system. Blocking of TMPRSS2 protease and cathepsin B/L activity could also be considered, however it appears that ACE2, rather than protease activity, may be the viral entry rate limiting factor [45].",

ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of systemic diseases including hypertension and are generally well tolerated [67]. This class of drugs has not previously been considered as having an anti-viral role. Crystallography studies demonstrate that while the ACE inhibitor lisinopril binds in a region near the centre of the receptor [68,69], the virus binding sites are on the outer surface of the receptor near the N terminal [39], so direct blocking by lisinopril of the virus attachment site seems unlikely. However, the potent ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 induces a large receptor conformational change, a hinge bending motion, important for both inhibitor binding and catalysis and could prove to be unfavourable for viral binding to the receptor and/or syncytial formation [69]. It was thought that metallopeptidase inhibitors such as MLN-4760 may prove useful for prevention of viral binding to ACE2 [70].",

The drug can be effective either before or after exposure to the virus, so could act both therapeutically and prophylactically. Several mechanisms have been proposed but of particular interest is that the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of ACE2 [[87], [88], [89]]. Chloroquine also has immuno-modulatory effects [86,90], suppressing the production/release of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 6, which may mitigate the severe inflammatory cascade associated with severe COVID-19 disease [86]. Recently, hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [91], fortuitous, since it appears that lower toxicity has been attributed to this derivative [92].",

One such study, a pilot observational study [93] showed that use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin demonstrated apparent improved clinical outcomes in 65/80 patients, expanding earlier work suggesting that combined therapy resulted in rapid reduction in viral load. Clearly, more robust clinical studies are needed and have been called for [74].",

The well-known association with irreversible visual loss due to retinal toxicity is considered a late manifestation [95], however early-onset (\u223c2 months) has been reported in a case where the ideal dosage was exceeded for one month [96]. A number of predisposing factors to retinal toxicity include genetic [97] - polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 gene, drug interactions [98] and racial factors [99]), may play a role. Chloroquine's anticancer activity in concert with zinc have been explained by the fact that chloroquine acts as a zinc ionophore [100], significantly, inhibiting cellular autophagy and enhancing apoptotic cell death via inhibition of lysosome function. It transpires that zinc inhibits coronavirus polymerase activity [101], blocking viral replication. For this reason, combination treatment for Covid-19 with chloroquine and zinc has been suggested [102], although this intervention has yet to be formally reported.",

In this class of drugs, agents such as telmisartan are long acting, with a mean half-life of 24 h [105]. Zinc has traditionally been used in astringent eye drops or as an excipient, zinc sulphate (0.25%) [83]. Since chloroquine and ACE2 inhibitors seem to act at different parts of the receptor, in combination, synergy is possible or at the very least an additive effect, permitting a reduction in dosage and risk of potential side effects. However, another issue is that ACE2 inhibitors may upregulate this receptor [106], perhaps increasing the risk of coronavirus infection. Early reports have suggested that hypertension may be a risk factor for infection but these are unconfirmed [107]. Azithromycin has also previously been safely used topically in the human eye as a 1\u20131.5% solution to treat ocular infections [78,79]. In the case of hydroxychloroquine, preliminary calculations suggest that with topical application, a dosage one to two orders of magnitude higher than plasma levels (reached with systemic treatment [108]) could be achieved.",

            "text": "At this point, clinical studies are needed expeditiously to investigate the safety and efficacy of local prophylactic regimens following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For instance, investigations can include initial local delivery of a combination of chloroquine, zinc and azithromycin to the eyelids and ocular surface with eye drops or a spray/aerosol. This would potentially inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the likely major entry point into the human body, would reduce the risk of systemic side effects and conserve drugs that may become scarce, since the dosage required would be much less than for systemic treatment. A spray or aerosol preparation would also allow treatment of the nasal passages [45] and mouth [109], given high ACE2 receptor populations in these locations. However, if the virus is truly oculotropic, this may be superfluous. If a patient has active infection of the respiratory tree, then this combined medication could also be given in an inhaled form. The advantage of this ACE2 targeting approach is that ACE2 receptors from the outer cornea, through the lacrimal drainage system to the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems as well as both nasal and oral cavities, are directly accessible to a high topical drug dose. Thus, the portals that make us susceptible to coronavirus attack and invasion can be used to provide protection that is likely to be safe, extensive, convenient and at low cost. The ocular surface, offering all of the benefits of local treatment familiar to ophthalmologists, may thus provide a convenient testing ground for rapid, safe and likely cost-effective trials of newer drugs that may be developed to combat this modern plague.",
