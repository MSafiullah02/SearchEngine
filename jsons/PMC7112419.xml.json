            "text": "In the literature, ACE2 isoforms were described with molecular mass ranging between 70 and 130 kDa. Donoghue and collaborators were able to express a 90 kDa recombinant ACE2 in the extracellular medium and cellular lysate using transfected CHO cells [1]. The same molecular mass was described for the enzymes identified in rat and mouse tissues [1], [14]. However, ACE2 expressed in mammal cells has a molecular mass of 120 kDa reduced to 85 kDa after enzymatic deglycosylation [2]. Other study also described ACE2 isoform with molecular masses ranging from 120 to 130 kDa in rat kidney [16]. The authors suggest that these differences could be explained by post-transductional modifications. An ACE2 presenting a molecular mass similar to the enzyme described in this study, 70 kDa, was purified from astrocyte cell culture, and was able to convert Ang II into Ang 1\u20137, suggesting that this protein is a secreted form of the enzyme [25]. Therefore, the lower molecular mass of purified ACE2 described by this study may be explained by deglycosylation process or this enzyme could be a secreted ACE2 isoform.",

The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by Cl\u2212 at concentrations ranging from 1 M to 1.5 M, differing from the data described by Yan collaborators that showed maximal enzymatic activity at 1.5 M NaCl at pH 7.5 for purified ACE2 from transfected SF21 cells [26] and also from Vickers and collaborators that reported an optimum activity for recombinant ACE2 from SF9 cells in the presence of 1 M NaCl at pH 6.5 [4]. Guy and collaborators showed maximal activity at pH 7.0 in the presence of 300 mM NaCl [27]. ACE2 has conserved both chloride ligands essential for its activity similar to ACE [28], suggesting that on other loci, such as renal tubular brush borders, is exposed to large ion fluxes and may be regulated in a such manner. The result revealed that the purified ACE2 from mouse mesangial cells had totally different NaCl dependent catalytic properties, but still has hydrolysis activity to Ang II, which means the purified product has ACE2 activity. We believe the purity of this enzyme could be a reason for different properties revealed in this study.",
