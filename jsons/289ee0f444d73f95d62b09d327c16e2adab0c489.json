Methods: Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high fat diet comprising of standard laboratory rat chow 84.3%, lard 5%, egg yolk powder 10%, cholesterol 0.2% and bile salt 0.5% for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the animals were kept in an overnight fast and injected with low dose of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.w). Results: Theaflavin (100 mg/kg b.w /day) was administered orally to diabetic rats for 30 days. At the end of the experimental period, diabetic control rats showed significant increase in plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with concomitant decrease in plasma insulin, total hemoglobin and body weight. The activities of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes, glycogen content and glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase were also altered in diabetic rats. Discussion: Oral administration of theaflavin to diabetic rats significantly ameliorated all the biochemical alterations to near normal levels.

Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes is associated with long term damage, dysfunction and eventually the failure of organs, particularly the eyes, kidneys, nerves and cardiovascular system [2] . In addition to hyperglycemia, several other factors such as dyslipidemia or hyperlipidemia are also involved in the development of cardiovascular complications in diabetes which are the major causes of morbidity and mortality [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 220 million people worldwide have diabetes and this number would be likely to more than double by the year 2030 [4] . The management of diabetes with insulin and synthetic oral hypoglycemic drugs can produce serious side effects and in addition, they fail to prevent diabetes related complications in many patients. Therefore, new diabetic management strategy is obligatory nowadays which should be more effective and have less side effects than the synthetic drugs [5] .

The observed decrease in the activity of Pyruvate kinase in the liver and kidney of streptozotocininduced diabetic rats readily accounts for the decreased utilization of glucose (glycolysis) and increased production of glucose (gluconeogenesis) by liver and kidney indicating that these two pathways are altered in diabetes [55] .

Thus, increased activity of LDH interferes with normal glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in the \u03b2 cells of pancreas and it may therefore be directly responsible for insulin secretory defects in diabetes due to the high fat diet and streptozotocin induced oxidative stress mediated cellular damage. Besides, the elevated levels of LDH in hepatic and renal tissue indicate the cell damage.
