The act of speaking generates oral fluid droplets that vary widely in size,1 and these droplets can harbor infectious virus particles. Whereas large droplets fall quickly to the ground, small droplets can dehydrate and linger as \u201cdroplet nuclei\u201d in the air, where they behave like an aerosol and thereby expand the spatial extent of emitted infectious particles.2 We report the results of a laser light-scattering experiment in which speech-generated droplets and their trajectories were visualized.",

These droplets produced flashes as they passed through the light sheet (Figure 1). The brightness of the flashes reflected the size of the particles and the fraction of time they were present in a single 16.7-msec frame of the video. The number of flashes in a single frame of the video was highest when the \u201cth\u201d sound in the word \u201chealthy\u201d was pronounced (Figure 1A). Repetition of the same phrase three times, with short pauses in between the phrases, produced a similar pattern of generated particles, with peak numbers of flashes as high as 347 with the loudest speech and as low as 227 when the loudness was slightly decreased over the three trials (see the top trace in Figure 1A). When the same phrase was uttered three times through a slightly damp washcloth over the speaker\u2019s mouth, the flash count remained close to the background level (mean, 0.1 flashes); this showed a decrease in the number of forward-moving droplets (see the bottom trace in Figure 1A).",

Panel A shows the flash count during each frame of a video produced at a rate of 60 frames per second, with and without a damp cloth covering the speaker\u2019s mouth. Green indicates spoken words. The number of flashes was highest (arrow) when the \u201cth\u201d sound in the word \u201chealthy\u201d was pronounced. The trace offset below the graph shows that when the speaker\u2019s mouth was covered with a damp cloth, there was no qualitative increase in the flash count during speech over the background level observed before the first trial of speech. The flash count during the silent periods between the spoken phrases remained above the background level, a finding that suggests that some of the speech droplets lingered inside the box for some seconds. Panel B shows frame 361 from the video, which corresponds to the red arrow in Panel A and to the highest number of speech droplets visualized in an individual frame of the video recording. The spots vary in brightness because of the differences in the size of the particles. Some of the spots are streaked, which suggests that the rate of 60 frames per second was insufficient to freeze the motion of the droplets. The feature highlighted by a dashed yellow circle corresponds to the tip of a very thin wire positioned just behind the light sheet; this wire provided a reference for setting the camera focus and gain before recording.
