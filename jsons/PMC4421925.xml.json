Although these are multiple non-physiological contact activators, this reaction forms the basis for the activated partial thromboplastin time clotting assay (aPTT). This assay is routinely used to evaluate defects in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, such as hemophilia A and B. Recent studies have identified endogenous activators of contact system, such as polyphospahte, collagen, misfolded protein aggregates, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), glycosaminoglycans, and nucleic acids [5]. Very recently, we reported that phosphatidylserine may also serve as an activator of contact system in vivo [4].",

            "text": "The physiologic, negatively charged surface for contact system activation is actually the assembly of these proteins on biologic surfaces, ie, cell membranes [1]. The specific interactions with biologic membranes of endothelial cells, platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes indicate that assembly and activation of this system takes place in a physiologic milieu. Contact system proteins can assemble on cell membrane, via binding to their receptors and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of proteoglycans including heparan sulphate (HS) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) [12,13]. Detailed investigations of the proteins of the contact system interacting with cells have led to understanding of how this system is physiologically active. The pivotal protein for contact system assembly on cell membranes is HK [14]. HK actually has three domains that fit into the putative kininogen receptor(s) on endothelial cells. Three receptors have been shown to mediate the binding of HK on cell surface, uPAR, gC1qR and cytokeratin-1 [1]. We have reported that HK binds to uPAR via its D5 in membrane rafts of endothelial cells [15], and the D3 and D5 of HK stimulate monocytes via uPAR and Mac1 to produce cytokines and chemokines [16]. Besides healthy cells, apoptotic cells may also provide surface for assemble and activation of contact system [4]. Recently, we have reported that HK bridges uPAR on monocytes/macrophages and phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, leading to engulfment of apoptotic cells, and assembly and activation of contact system on apoptotic cell surface [4]. Because efferocytosis is essential for regulation of immune responses and tissue homeostasis, the involvement of HK in recognition and binding of apoptotic cells reveals a novel role of contact system in \u201capoptotic\u201d innate immunity. Cell surface GAGs expose vast numbers of specific binding sites for contact system. HK and FXII bind with high affinity (KD \u2264 144 nM) to endothelial GAGs in the presence of zinc ions, thereby modulating contact system-driven BK formation [17].",

Indeed, the contact system is highly conserved among mammalian species. Besides, FXII-gene-deficient mice are protected from cerebral ischemia related to reduced fibrin formation in the microvasculature of the ischemic tissue, consistent with an essential role of FXII for thrombus formation in thromboembolic disease [25]. Mice lacking FXI are similarly protected from vessel occlusive fibrin formation [26]. Thus, the contact system is critical in pathologic clotting via the activation of intrinsic pathway [27].

While the human kininogen gene has a single copy, the mouse genome contains 2 homologous kininogen genes, Kng1 and Kng2, which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner [20]. Merkulov et al. found that mKng1 is expressed primarily in the liver, the Kng1-deficient mice lacked plasma HK and low-molecular-weight kininogen (LK), as well as Delta-HK-D5, a kininogen isoform that lacking Kng1 domain 5 [30]. Similar to FXII deficient mice, Kng1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a significantly prolonged time to carotid artery occlusion following Rose Bengal administration and laser-induced arterial injury [30], suggesting that plasma HK contributes to arterial thrombosis in mice. Kng1\u2212/\u2212 mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion developed dramatically smaller brain infarctions and less severe neurologic deficits without an increase in infarct-associated hemorrhage [31]. This protective effect was preserved due to reduced thrombus formation in ischemic vessels and improved cerebral blood flow [31]. Since Kng1 deficient mice also showed less severe blood\u2013brain barrier damage and edema formation, and the local inflammatory response was reduced compared with controls, Kng1 appears to be instrumental in pathologic thrombus formation and inflammation but dispensable for hemostasis [31].",

Besides, platelets release FXII-activator polyphosphate, which leads to activation of the contact system and fibrin production on activated platelet surfaces in the developing thrombus.

Genetic and pharmaceutical studies also demonstrate that the contact system plays a critical role in venous thrombosis. In a mouse FeCl3 injury model, PK-deficient mice exhibit reduced venous thrombosis thrombosis by 50% [28]. Selective knockdown of prekallikrein in mice using antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology also results in an antithrombotic phenotype in stenosis-induced inferior vena cava thrombosis model [29]. Similarly, depletion of FXII or XI in rabbits using ASO significantly attenuates catheter-induced venous thrombosis [33]. von Bruhl et al. found that genetic ablation of FXII confers protection against DVT amplification in mice [34]. In their model, thrombus-resident neutrophils binds FXII and supports its activation through the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [35], which is indispensable for subsequent DVT propagation [34]. When polyP is intravenously applied, it activates FXII and leads to lethal pulmonary embolism in wild-type mice, which was prevented by either FXII-deficiency or FXII inhibitor, suggesting a critical role of contact system [6,36]. Recombinant Ixodes ricinus contact phase inhibitor (Ir-CPI) is a Kunitz-type protein expressed by the salivary glands of the tick Ixodes ricinus, specifically interacts with activated human FXIIa, FXIa, and kallikrein and prolongs the aPTT in vitro [36]. Intravenous administration of Ir-CPI in rats and mice caused a dose-dependent reduction in venous thrombus formation [36].",

For example, selective depletion of factor XII with antisense oligonucleotides attenuates catheter thrombosis in rabbits [33]. Inhibition of FXII activation using the peptide-based inhibitor PCK in mice also provides protection from cerebral ischemia, without causing excessive bleeding at a surgical injury site.

            "text": "Besides the activation of intrinsic coagulation pathway, one of the downstream events of contact system includes fibrinolysis. Activation of plasminogen in vivo can reproducibly be studied by a short lasting infusion of desamino D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). Levi et al. found that the formation of plasmin upon the DDAVP stimulus as reflected by circulating plasmin-a2-antiplasmin complexes was lower in FXII-deficient patients than in healthy volunteers, suggesting that activation of the contact system occurred after DDAVP infusion in healthy volunteers [38]. The plasminogen activating activity in normal plasma after infusion of DDAVP was only partially blocked (by two-third) with specific antibodies to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type PA. The residual activity could be quenched by an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against FXII and was absent in FXII-deficient patients [38]. Thus, activation of the contact system contributes to fibrinolysis. The impaired fibrinolytic activity in FXII deficient patients may explain the occurrence of thromboembolic complications in these patients. Patients deficient in factor XI suffer from abnormal bleeding. The Ashkenazi Jewish probands with severe FXI deficiency had an increased proportion of episodes of bleeding complications after surgery at sites with enhanced local fibrinolysis, such as the urinary tract, or during tooth extraction, suggesting that FXI plays a role in the downregulation of fibrinolysis [39]. In consistence with this hypothesis, systemic incorporation of anti-factor XI antibodies resulted in an almost twofold increase in endogenous fibrinolysis compared with a control antibody, indicating a novel role for the intrinsic pathway of coagulation [40]. In a static in-vitro coagulation model in which clotting is initiated in recalcified citrated plasma by tissue factor coated on the bottom of microtiter plates, when larger clots (200\u2013300 microl plasma) were formed, FXI not only increased prothrombin activation and the fibrin formation rate but also inhibited fibrinolysis. Thus, in addition to enhancement of tissue factor-initiated coagulation, FXI inhibits fibrinolysis to stabilize the formed clot [22].",

Activation of the contact system is a major part of plasma host-defense systems and plays a crucial role as the first line in host defense against pathogens. A growing number of studies indicated that the contact system is important in host defense against infection by bacteria, parasitic protozoan, and virus [20,41,42]. As mentioned above, bacteria may activate the contact system directly through physical interaction, or indirectly by the releases such as proteases and polyP. Similarly to cell surface, contact system proteins bind to bacteria, directly mediating the assembly and activation of the contact system on bacterial surface [43]. Proteinases secreted from bacteria such as staphophains released from Staphylococcus aureus directly cleave HK. Some proteinases such as from Porphyromonas gingivalis indirectly cleave HK by proteolytic activation of FXII or PK [44]. Polyphosphate from bacteria also activates FXII, initiates BK formation and BK-mediated vascular leakage and induces pain sensations. Activation of contact system contributes to host defense against bacterial infection [43]. Both kallikrein and FXIIa activate the complement system, leading to killing of bacteria. Bradykinin may recruitment neutrophil and macrophages to the site of infection, and activate innate sentinel cells via the bradykinin receptor B2R pathway [45]. However, persistent bacteria-driven contact system activation may lead to pathological plasma kinin levels concomitant with consumption of contact factors. In patients, abundant production of BK may induce hypotension and vascular leak, exerting disadvantage effects and contributing to multiple organ failure. Indeed, in severe sepsis patients, the kinin system is activated as exemplified by elevated plasma bradykinin and consumption of prekallikrein and FXII. However, in a double-blind randomized multicenter study, a B2R antagonist showed no improvement in outcome in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis [46]. This result represents the complexity of the role of contact system in inflammatory cascades.",

Trypanosoma cruzi binds HK and cleaves HK by cruzipain, to liberate bradykinin, which is increased up to 35-fold in the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans [47]. The liberated kinins activate innate immunity by potently stimulating dendritic cell maturation via the B2R. However, excessive bradykinin leads to persistent parasitism in the edematous tissues. A recent study has shown that activation of contact system is also critical in virus-induced endothelial cell permeability [48]. Hantavirus infection causes vascular leakage due to alterations of the endothelial barrier. Incubation of plasma proteins with hantavirus-infected endothelial cells results in HK cleavage, increase in enzymatic activities of FXIIa and kallikrein and liberation of bradykinin, leading to dramatic increases in endothelial cell permeability [45]. Another virus HSV1 directly binds to FXII and mediates its activation in the presence of PK. An inhibitor of activated FXII, anti-FXII, anti-kallikrein and anti-FXI Abs inhibit HSV1-initiated clotting [20]. Thus virus can trigger and amplify coagulation through the contact phase and intrinsic pathway, suggesting an additional mechanism that contributes to vascular pathology in virus infection.",

In patients with RA, elevated levels of plasma kallikrein and bradykinin are detected in synovial fluid and plasma, and positively correlated with the degree of joint pain and inflammation. Bradykinin receptor expression also increased in circulating and synovial neutrophils of RA patients. The concept that the KKS is important in the pathogenesis of arthritis is supported by the observations in animal models. Lewis rats have a mutation in HK (S511N) rendering it susceptible to cleavage by plasma kallikrein, the administration of streptococcal cell wall polymers peptidoglycan - polysaccharide (PG-PS) induces systemic inflammatory response including arthritis in Lewis rats, but not in other strains such as Buffalo and Fischer rats. Accompanied with synovitis and joint erosion in Lewis rats, there is a decrease in plasma prekallikrein and HK, likely due to consumption of the precursor proteins following KKS activation. A specific kallikrein inhibitor prevents arthritis and the systemic complications in the PG-PS model [49]. The Brown-Norway-Katholiek (B/N/Ka) rat strain has a severe deficiency of both plasma kininogens (HK and LK) due to a single point mutation, Ala163Thr, which results in defective secretion of kininiogen from the liver. Kininogen-deficient rats on a Lewis genetic background exhibit attenuated acute and chronic inflammatory arthritis [50], demonstrating that plasma HK is a key mediator of inflammatory diseases.",

Recently we report that the inhibition of plasma kallikrein ameliorates arthritis in two Lewis rat models, PG-PS model and collagen-induced arthritis model, the effect of plasma kallikrein is probably through bradykinin [51]. Bradykinin has two receptors, constitutively expressed B2R and inducible B1R both belong to G protein-coupled receptors. A recent study by Song et al. demonstrated B2R deficiency did not attenuate arthritis in a mouse model of anti-collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) [52]. However, using the same CAIA model, we found that the double deficiency of B1R and B2R significantly inhibits the development and severity of CAIA [53]. A decrease in plasma HK level was observed at early stage of CAIA [53], suggesting the activation of the KKS and generation of bradykinin at acute phase of the disease. These observations provide the first genetic evidence showing that bradykinin is critical in the pathogenesis of CAIA and B1R is likely a key receptor that mediates the proinflammatory effect of bradykinin in arthritis.",

First, the KKS components can enter synovial joint space either by transudation from the plasma or from degranulating neutrophils chemotactically attracted into the synovium. Excessive release of kinins in the synovial tissues may stimulate the synthesis of second wave of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2,IL-6, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and histamine) to enhance inflammatory joint disease. Upregulated expression of bradykinin receptors in joints may increase cytokine production. Second, upregulated bradykinin receptor expression in circulating monocytes may enhance systemic inflammation and their homing to inflamed synovial tissue. The expression of B1R in CAIA can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1\u03b2, IL-6, and likely occurs as part of an proinflammatory feedback mechanism. B1RB2R deficiency significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA expression, but not that of TNF\u03b1 mRNA, suggesting that bradykinin receptors differently regulate these cytokine expressions, and their role in the pathogenesis of CAIA is, at least in part, through the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6.",

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) participate in synovial neovascularization in arthritis [56,57]. Thus, how EPCs are recruited to the inflamed synovium and participates in synovial neovascularization becomes an important issue. Recently, we have demonstrated that HKa regulates EPC functions in vitro [58,59], revealing the connection between the KKS activation and EPC biology. In rodent model of arthritis, we found another role of the KKS in the homing function of EPCs in arthritis [51]. In Lewis rat model of arthritis, EPCs are recruited to inflamed synovium and form new vessels, which was blocked by specific plasma kallikrein inhibitor; Bradykinin stimulates transendothelial migration of EPCs by selectively upregulating expression of homing receptor C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) [51]. Our study provides novel evidence that activation of the KKS is associated with synovial recruitment of EPCs at acute phase of arthritis, EPCs are likely a new target for bradykinin in the setting of acute arthritis. The multiple function of contact system in arthritis demonstrates that therapeutic approaches targeting the KKS activation have considerable potential in arthritis.",

Plasma KKS activation has been observed in patients with IBD [60]. In active ulcerative colitis patients, a significant decrease of plasma prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and C1 inhibitor levels was observed as compared with controls. The decreases in KKS components results from the consumption by activation. Activation of the KKS may mediate inflammation in the active phase of ulcerative colitis. In Crohn\u2019s disease patients, plasma levels of prekallikrein, factor XI, HK and its cleaved form were normal. However, they had significantly higher levels of antigen and functional Cl-inhibitor. The undetectable contact system activation in peripheral blood might be related to the high plasma levels of Cl-inhibitor, an important inhibitor of the contact system in the circulation [61]. Both B2R and B1R proteins are expressed in the epithelial cells of normal intestines and those from patients with UC and CD. B1R protein is localized in macrophages at the center of granulomas in CD. B2R protein expression in the apexes of enterocytes in the basal area and intracellularly in inflammatory tissue is similar with normal tissue. In contrast, B1R protein is localized in the basal area of enterocytes in normal intestine but in the apical portion of enterocytes in inflamed tissue. Compared with normal controls, B1R protein is significantly increased in both active UC and CD intestines [61]. In patients with active UC, B1R mRNA is significantly higher than B2R mRNA. However, in inactive UC patients, the B1R and B2R mRNA are comparably expressed. Thus, increased B1R gene and protein expression in active IBD provides a structural basis of the important role of bradykinin in chronic inflammation, and may reflect intestinal inflammation.",

Consumption of the precursor proteins PK and HK in Lewis rats indicates activation of the plasma contact system and closely correlated with chronic intestinal inflammation. In another indomethacin induced enterocolitis model, rat displayed KKS activation manifested by a significant decrease in plasma prekallikrein and HK functional levels, and by HK cleavage [62].

Colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) is associated with tissue damage, neutrophil infiltration, which can be reduced by the selective B1R antagonist SSR240612 and B1R deficiency [64]. Although these results suggest the role of B1R in the pathogenesis of IBD, this effect seems model-specific. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, colitis was significantly exacerbated in B1R\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment with a selective B1R antagonist, DALBK or SSR240612, had no effect on DSS-induced colitis [64]. In contrast, a selective B2R antagonist prevented the exacerbation of colitis in B1R\u2212/\u2212 mice. B2R mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in colonic tissue from the B1R\u2212/\u2212 mice after DSS administration. Thus, exacerbation of DSS-induced colitis in mice lacking B1R is through compensatory up-regulation of B2R. Although this study suggests that B2R is a major receptor mediating the role of bradykinin in IBD, B2R\u2212/\u2212 mice is not protected from the disease in the same DSS model [65]. Thus, the role of bradykinin and specific involvement of its two receptors in the pathogenesis of IBD is very complex, more work is warranted to evaluate their dynamic cooperation and distinct involvement in the development and progression of the diseases.",
