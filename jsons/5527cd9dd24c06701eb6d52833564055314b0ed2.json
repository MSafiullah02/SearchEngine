An outbreak of dengue-like illness (DLI) that occurred in April 2016 prompted this study, which aimed to determine the population's immunity status and identify the arboviruses circulating in the country. Methods: A household survey, involving 188 participants in two urban areas (Honiara and Gizo), and a parallel hospital-based clinical survey were conducted in April 2016. The latter was repeated in December after a surge in DLI cases. Arbovirus IgG ELISA were performed on the household blood samples to determine the prevalence of arboviruses in the community, while qPCR testing of the clinical samples was used to identify the circulating arboviruses. Dengue virus (DENV)-positive samples were further characterized by amplifying and sequencing the envelope gene.",

The qPCR positivity rates of the clinical samples collected in April 2016 were as follows: DENV 39.6%, Zika virus 16.7%, and chikungunya virus 6.3%, which increased to 74%, 48%, and 20% respectively in December 2016. The displacement of the circulating serotype-3, genotype-1, with DENV serotype 2, genotype cosmopolitan was responsible for the outbreak in 2016. Conclusions: A DENV outbreak in Solomon Islands was caused by the introduction of a single serotype. The high prevalence of DENV provided transient cross-protection, which prevented the introduction of a new serotype from the hyperendemic region for at least 3 years. The severe outcomes seen in the recent outbreak probably resulted from changes in the causative viruses and the effects of population immunity and changes in the outbreak pattern. Solomon Islands needs to step up surveillance to include molecular tools, increase regional communication, and perform timely interventions.",

            "text": "Dengue fever (DF) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection in tropical and subtropical regions. It is estimated to cause 50-100 million symptomatic infections annually [1] . The complex interactions between the virus and the human population have resulted in an unpredictable disease evolution and variable clinical outcomes associated with the infection. The majority of infections are mild and self-limiting, but a small number progress to severe clinical manifestations, which can lead to severe organ complications and even death [2] [3] [4] . Dengue virus (DENV) is a Flavivirus from the Flaviviridae family. Its RNA genome is approximately 11-kb long and contains an open reading frame, which codes for three structural and five non-structural proteins. The virus has four distinct antigenic serotypes and several genotypes, which produce different outcomes during outbreaks [5] [6] [7] .",

On the other hand, in SE Asia all four DENV serotypes are circulating, and a 3-year wave-like outbreak pattern, in which the disease emanates from a central metropolitan city, is seen. There have been very few quality descriptive studies of DF conducted in the PICTs, resulting in a paucity of information about the magnitudes and drivers of DF epidemics in this region. The available studies were mostly based in a clinic setting or involved specific groups like a blood donor population [9, 10] .

This outbreak was unique, as it lasted longer than usual, i.e., previous outbreaks lasted 2 years, but the 2013 outbreak lasted until early 2016.

The virological investigations involved 2-weeklong blood sample collection periods (in April or December 2016), during which blood samples were collected from DLI patients that visited the hospitals in Honiara and Gizo. The household seroprevalence study was performed in April 2016 in Gizo (Western Province) and a community settlement (Tuvaruhu) that was representative of Honiara. Each of the subjects that gave their consent filled out a questionnaire, before approximately 500 \u03bcL of blood was collected in a pediatric tube, containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), using the finger prick method (Becton Dickinson collection system). The blood samples were brought back to the hospital laboratory and processed by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min to separate the plasma.

The templates were amplified using TksGflex TM DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) and previously described overlapping primers for DENV-2 and DENV-3 [20] . The PCR products were then cycle-sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (version 3.1), before being sequenced on the ABI3130xl automated sequence analyzer (Thermo Table 1 The primers used in the qPCR screening of the arbo-viruses Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The final 1485-bp sequence for DENV-2 and the final 1479-bp sequence for DENV-3 were obtained by manually assembling the overlapping sequences in BioEdit (version 7.19) [21] . Our study sequences were uploaded to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under accession numbers LC440471 to LC440484. These sequences were combined with those circulating SE Asia, Australia, and PICTs (from GenBank) to construct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood (ML) method in the software MEGA (version 7) [22] . Multiple full-envelope nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W, which is integrated into the MEGA software, while evolutionary distances were computed using the recommended Tamura-Nei + G model. The reliability of the ML analysis was evaluated via a bootstrap test of 3000 replications. A different genotype from that of the interest group was set as an outgroup in each of the dengue trees.",

Based on the syndromic data obtained in 2013, the high anti-DENV IgG antibody prevalence rate found in our study before the 2016 surge must have arisen during the first 3 months of an outbreak. This would have resulted in at least two-thirds of the population being exposed and becoming immune to the circulating serotype. A study conducted in Bangkok suggested that such exposure induces 3 years transient cross-protection against other DENV serotypes [29] . This would have provided herd immunity, which would have helped control the outbreak and could have been responsible for the alternative serotype outbreak pattern seen in the country [30] . It was also suggested that DENV-immune individuals are cross-protected against ZIKV [31] , which would probably explain the low prevalence of ZIKV in April 2016 despite its circulation in the country in 2015 (GenBank KX 216632) [32] .",

The DENV responsible for the new infection will trigger antibody production from preexisting plasma cells, but these antibodies will not be able to neutralize the newly introduced serotype. The non-neutralizing binding of the antibodies to the virus results in the formation of a complex that binds to the Fc\u03b3 receptor, which is expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, to facilitate antibodydependent enhancement [35] .

Secondary infections and the DENV serotype are important factors affecting the diagnostic sensitivity of NS1-based RDT [37, 38] . In our study, the NS1-based RDT was found to have lower sensitivity for the DENV-2 serotype than for the previously reported DENV-3.",

This successful introduction was unique, as it was the first time that two serotypes were found to be co-circulating in the country. The cocirculation of multiple serotypes is a feature of endemic settings and was also recently reported in neighboring PNG [39] .

The DENV has probably been introduced into the PICTs multiple times from multiple sources.

The sample size was small, as it was based on the high DENV positivity rate (approximately 30%) seen during the last outbreak. It was therefore not ideal for investigating the ZIKV or CHKV, which have low prevalence rates. As the clinical study was initially only planned to involve molecular virological surveillance, it lacks demographic and clinical information. This also explains why the April 2016 samples were not subjected to serological testing. However, this study provided important information that will aid understanding of the unique outbreak pattern seen in this small population.",

The displacement of a single serotype (DENV-3) by a newly introduced one (DENV-2) was the predominant cause of the 2016 DLI outbreak, but there was evidence of ZIKV and CHKV co-circulating. The outbreak pattern suggests that natural population immunity is still the main control mechanism and that the population will always be vulnerable to vector-borne diseases. There is a need to step up vector-control activities and community mobilization to reduce the threat of such diseases in Solomon Islands. We recommend that Solomon Islands needs to increase its capacity for disease surveillance to include molecular screening of different arboviruses and some capacity to perform regular sequencing of the envelope genes of viral isolates. We also recommend the surveillance of disease vectors and their insecticide-resistance status. The communication of this information within the region will enable each country/ territory to prepare as best as they can for the next outbreak. ",
