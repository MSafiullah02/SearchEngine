The coronaviral nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) has been implicated in viral replication, polyprotein cleavage, and host immune interference. We report the structure of the C domain from the SARS-Unique Domain of bat CoV HKU4. The protein has a frataxin fold, consisting of 5 antiparallel \u03b2 strands packed against 2 \u03b1 helices. Bioinformatics analyses and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were conducted to investigate the function of HKU4 C. The results showed that HKU4 C engages in protein-protein interactions with the nearby M domain of nsp3. The HKU4 C residues involved in protein-protein interactions are conserved in group 2c CoVs, indicating a conserved function.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known as single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses which possess positive-sense RNA genomes. 1 They are responsible for potentially lethal infections related to the human respiratory system, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Additionally, CoVs cause other types of infections, including acute respiratory distress and acute lung injury syndrome; upper and lower respiratory disease ranging from mild to severe; and gastrointestinal disease. 2 While SARS and MERS CoVs are similar to other CoVs in genomic composition, they belong to two different phylogenetic lineages. Betacoronaviruses can be divided into 4 lineages known as A, B, C, and D. The SARS CoV belongs to the lineage B, 3 while the MERS CoV belongs to the C lineage. These two types of betacoronaviruses are predicted to originate zoonotically from bats, which are known to be a reservoir host for CoVs. 3 Additionally, some bat species such as the lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) can act as hosts for the bat CoV HKU4, which is a betacoronavirus in the C lineage. 4 Since this virus exhibits a high similarity to MERS with respect to the spike protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, and nucleocapsid protein, HKU4 is a relative of the MERS CoV. 5 CoVs contain one of the largest RNA genomes, which encodes two important polyproteins known as the replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab. 6 Viral proteases catalyze the cleavage of these polyproteins into several nonstructural proteins (nsp) which are involved in the formation of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC). This complex carries out RNA synthesis, RNA processing, and interference with the host cell innate immune system. 7, 8 The largest nsp present in this complex is nsp3 which is the most variable region in the CoV genome. 9 nsp3 is a complex protein which may contain one or several macrodomains, several conserved uncharacterized domains, a papain-like cysteine protease, and transmembrane regions. Therefore, it can be identified as a multifunctional protein. 10 The macrodomain is known to be a conserved region of nsp3 present in different viral species including CoVs. 8 This macrodomain plays a major role in the virulence of CoVs since they can infect through protein-protein interactions related to host immune system. 11 There is an additional macrodomain called the SARS-unique domain (SUD) which contains two divergent domains and a conserved domain. This three-domain structure is capable of binding G-quadruplex nucleic acids 10, 12 and of interacting with p53 to target it for degradation by stabilizing the RCHY E3 ligase. 13 We report here the first structural study of the HKU4 SARS-unique region.",

The first cycle of the calculation resulted in a fold that was consistent throughout the remaining cycles of the calculation. The completion of more cycles of the calculation showed a decrease in target function and RMSD of the ensemble of 20 conformers. The ensemble was then energy-minimized through simulated annealing using CYANA. 39 Validation of the structure was performed using ProCheck 3.5.4, 40 Protein Data Bank validation suite, 41, 42 Protein Structure Validation Software, 43 and MolMol v1.0.7. 44 The input and output of UNIO calculations were also evaluated in addition to the agreement of the structure with NMR observables.",
