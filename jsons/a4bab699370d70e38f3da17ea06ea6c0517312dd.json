Predictably, policy makers and business leaders feel anxious as they struggle to marshal and mobilize their talent pool through this global health crisis. Unlike other global crises, this exogenous shock has speeded up the adoption of social and physical distance and remote working and may be pointing the way to the future of global talent management. The increased IT capacity and a move away from traditional work arrangements make talent more mobile, which means cities and business compete for the best employees globally. This is in particular true for geographic locations in which demographic trends drive talent shortage, such as in Dubai.",

            "text": "While Dubai is not a country, but one of the seven emirates within the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it is a locality with own national characteristics. Its dynamic economic activities, originally mainly rooted in pearl fishing and merchandising, and then in oil and more latterly tourism, drove Dubai's progress prior to its becoming a part of the UAE in 1971. While there are no official statistics about the population in 1950, it is estimated that the total population then consisted of around 20,000 individuals. Its population grew by 2019 to an astounding 3,355,900. Table 1 summarizes the number of the population by nationals and expatriates from 2017-2019, a development that was almost exclusively due to the increasing number of expatriates (Haak-Saheem and Brewster 2017). Most recent government reports show that Dubai has been particularly successful in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in advanced technology and specialized talent via the international labour market. In addition to the rapid growth of FDI inflows, domestic firms (e.g. Emirates Airlines) made significant progress in becoming internationally more competitive. These domestic companies are, almost by definition, owned by local Emiratis but employ a high number of expatriates. The organizational hierarchy reflects to a great extent the social order in the Emirates, with Western expatriates reporting directly to the Emirati bosses, then Arab and Asian middle managers and a high number of mainly Asian blue-collar workers (Haak-Saheem and Brewster 2017).",

Consequently, the region has seen various politically led nationalization strategies designed to encourage and support the employment of nationals in preference to expatriates. However, research reveals that 99% of the employees in the private sector are foreigners (Al Waqfi and Forstenlechner 2014) and the public sector remains the prime employer of nationals across the Gulf States. The vast majority of these expatriates is, at their different status levels, economically driven. They come to Dubai because of the attractive salary packages, compared to those they could have received at home, no income tax, and for all but those at the lowest levels of society, the comfortable living conditions (Ewers 2017) . Fundamental to the legislation in Dubai is that expatriates' employment and their residency visa are intricately bound up together, so that losing one means losing the other. This, of course, gives the employer considerable leverage and given the importance of the income to these workers leads to acquiescence rather than complaint.",

Understandably, it creates concern and uncertainty among individuals and organizations.

Full or partial lockdown measures affect around 2.7 billion workers, representing around 81% of the global workforce (UN 2020). In addition, travel restrictions and border closures affect the mobility of talent across the world. The government of Dubai has started to implement measures to absorb the devastating impact of this global health crisis. ",

Unlike in the past, where employees' career decisions were bound to employers' sponsorship, the Virtual Labour market provides greater flexibility and autonomy to expatriates to switch jobs. While firms in need of temporary workers are expected to use this platform to announce job vacancies, current job seekers can also apply through the system. The Ministry manages the Virtual Labour Market as an electronic platform to manage expatriates' movement by issuing temporary work permits for those employees who transfer their employment to another employer.",

To remain competitive, the ability to attract and retain new skills and competencies will remain critical. The introduction of new measures, such as the Virtual Labour Market, will most likely remain in place post Covid-19. The combination of a lower degree of central control and a higher level of flexibility may be the renaissance of global talent management in Dubai's labour market. Working remotely and more independently will become a new norm to be addressed in labour market structures post Covid-19. Taking it all together, the new level of flexibility introduced into Dubai's employment market is likely to result in (1) stronger competition for jobs and talent, (2) increased flexibility of work, space and time, (3) active support to assist individuals to find jobs and (4) increased investment in talent retention.",
