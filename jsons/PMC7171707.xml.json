Moreover, alveolar damage and smudge cells have been observed.35 One study reported histopathologic changes during hMPV infection in young patients.33 The bronchoalveolar lavage samples and lung biopsy specimens of these patients displayed epithelial cell degeneration or necrosis with detached ciliary tufts and round red cytoplasmic inclusions, frequent neutrophils, and mucus.",

The majority of vaccine candidates that used live, attenuated viruses have shown good immunogenicity and have guaranteed protection against subsequent infections in animal models.129 Recently, a wild-type recombinant hMPV strain has been approved as a parent virus for the development of live, attenuated hMPV vaccine candidates because it has been shown to be infectious in a trial that involved 21 healthy adults.130\n",

Despite this progress, other goals remain to be achieved. More work is required to understand the role of hMPV antigenic variability in human populations, to clarify the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity after infection, and to confirm the existence of a real and long-lasting cross protection against different hMPV genotypes after first contact with the virus. The results obtained from additional studies focusing on these aspects may offer a true perspective on the future of the development of effective therapeutic and preventive measures against hMPV.",
