            "text": "AHF often leads to worsening renal and hepatic function. Cardiorenal syndrome and hepatic congestion can rapidly progress to irreversible stages. While no single test is an optimal predictor of recovery following heart transplantation, current guidelines recommend assessing renal function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance. Evaluation often includes 24-hour proteinuria assessment, renal ultrasonography, and consultation with a nephrologist. The liver is more challenging than the kidney to predict degree of irreversible damage. Screening tools such as assessment of hepatic synthetic function (e.g., international normalized ratio [INR], platelets, albumin) are often misleading. Imaging of the liver, including abdominal ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT), can often yield inconsistent results. The liver biopsy is being debated as a gold standard. Optimal liver biopsy specimens still have up to a 25% rate of discordance for fibrosis staging and an inherent risk of sampling bias.11 Newer imaging techniques\u2014such as ultrasound elastography/fibroscan, perfusion imaging with CT, and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) may improve disease assessment.

            "text": "Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is the most common cause of pulmonary hypertension worldwide. Pulmonary hypertension increases the risk for right ventricular failure during the perioperative period and significantly worsens mortality.12 Patients under consideration for heart transplantation should undergo right heart catheterization (RHC). Several key parameters are determined at the time of RHC, including pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), transpulmonary gradient (TPG), and the diastolic pulmonary gradient. Pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure greater than 50 mm Hg and a TPG greater than 15 mm Hg or a PVR greater than 3 Wood units is a class I recommendation to perform a vasodilator challenge. If these parameters can be corrected during initial hemodynamic measurement (e.g., with the administration of intravenous nitroprusside or an inotropic agent), it can safely be assumed that these abnormalities are secondary to the marked degree of cardiac dysfunction. Many AHF centers use indwelling PA catheters to allow for inpatient hemodynamic optimization. Select patients with severe cardiac dysfunction may require temporary MCS (tMCS) to fully unload the LV and allow for optimization of hemodynamics. This strategy may improve patient selection for durable MCS and, ultimately, patient outcomes. Durable MCS has been successful in lowering LV filling pressures over months, leading to negative remodeling. This strategy may provide marginal candidates the opportunity to become acceptable for heart transplantation. RHC should be routinely performed on patients based on risk factors and the clinical severity of disease in those who are being considered for heart transplantation. During episodes of decompensation or if patients are found to have unacceptably high PA pressures, admission to the CICU with PA catheter placement for medical optimization can be very helpful prior to transplantation. Young donor hearts with a na\u00efve right ventricle (RV) have limited exposure to elevated pulmonary pressures and are at high risk for acute RV failure when transplanted into individuals with pulmonary hypertension. Patients with irreversible pulmonary hypertension may be considered for combined heart-lung transplantation.",

The critical importance of immunosuppression immediately postoperatively leaves little room for error. It is routine to consult with an infectious disease specialist prior to transplantation if there are any active infectious concerns. Inpatient transplant candidates are particularly at risk for the development of a nosocomial infection. Meticulous attention to ongoing indications for indwelling lines or Foley catheters can help to avoid preventable infections. Practicing consistent sterile precautions while performing line maintenance can help prevent catheter-related infections. Using a very low threshold at the first sign of fever or leukocytosis to initiate a thorough investigation is recommended. At times, it is necessary to defer a patient's candidacy or downgrade a patient's listing status. An extensive infectious workup is performed on all potential transplant candidates. Finally, a thorough dental examination should be conducted before listing to identify patients with poor dentition and subclinical sources of infection. It is also important to recognize that patients who test positive for cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or prior tuberculosis (TB) infections can still be considered for heart transplantation. A transplant infectious disease physician can be instrumental in guiding therapy for this patient population, especially after the initiation of immunosuppression.",

Frailty is an independent predictor of increased all-cause mortality in patients with AHF who are referred for heart transplantation.14 The difficulty with evaluating frailty is a lack of standardization. Flint et al.15 raise concern that not all frailty can be considered the same.

These strategies should have been used earlier in the course of the disease, but in a recent review34 of over 1000 consecutive patients listed for heart transplant, only 51% of the patients had an ICD in place at the time of being listed. Patients who suffer decompensation due to arrhythmia may benefit from an electrophysiology evaluation. Options include ablative procedures, optimization of antidysrhythmic regimens, and, in some cases, surgical sympathectomy to treat potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. If loss of sinus rhythm is thought to have been a precipitant of the decompensation, a robust attempt should be made to establish and maintain sinus rhythm. Based on the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, amiodarone and dofetilide are the preferred antidysrhythmic drugs largely based on their neutral effect on mortality in the HF population.Box 48.6Acute Precipitants of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure\nDietary indiscretion: high salt intakePulmonary infectionsMedication changes or nonadherenceArrhythmias and antidysrhythmic medicationsAnemiaThyroid dysfunction\nAlt-text: Box 48.6Data from Tsuyuki RT, McKelvie RS, Arnold JMO, et al.

In general, systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg, serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dL in men and greater than 2.0 mg/dL in women, or a serum potassium level greater than 5.0 mmol/L should give pause to clinicians when considering initiation of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, ARNI, or aldosterone antagonist.

Cardiorenal syndrome may require support from inotropic infusions or the use of tMCS to help relieve congestion and improve renal function.

Although it is common for the initiation of GDMT to lead to a rise in creatinine, diuretics should not be withheld. Many effectively treated patients will experience an increase in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, often by as much as 50%, which is acceptable. One strategy to deal with worsening renal function is to slow the rate of diuresis if the patient is no longer volume overloaded and to avoid excessive vasodilation.

In general, the adverse effects of these medications are duration dependent and dose dependent; combining agents at lower doses may help avoid adverse events. Patient dependence upon continuous IV inotropic support is a poor prognostic indicator and signals the very final stages of AHF. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status listing acknowledges the increased morbidity and mortality associated with continuous IV inotropes; thus these patients are given higher priority on the waiting list. Caution must be exerted when transitioning off inotropic support. Patients frequently become overly sensitive to afterload reduction in the setting of intravascular depletion or while titrating down inotropic support. Therefore, special attention should be given to assessing the patient's volume status and tolerance of vasodilators. The role for PA catheter-guided management of hemodynamics with special attention to the SVR can help avoid this clinical scenario. Renal vascular vasodilation and renal vascular congestion can both lead to a rise in serum creatinine. Anticipating and differentiating between these events can help prevent patient mismanagement. \u201cStart low and go slow\u201d is an appropriate strategy when it comes to oral vasodilator dosing prior to discontinuation of inotropic therapy. In the clinical scenario in which inotropic weaning is unsuccessful, a plan for palliative care, bridge to MCS, or bridge to transplantation should be put in place. When a patient is discharged on inotropic support that is not palliative, ICD placement should be considered given the increased risk for arrhythmia-related, sudden cardiac death.",

The UNOS is the only nonprofit organization that has ever run the OPTN and has been managing it since the initial contract was awarded in 1986. The UNOS has helped to develop an organ-sharing system in which donor hearts are allocated based on degree of illness in the recipient, blood type compatibility, size disparity, and length of time that the candidate has been actively waiting for transplantation. The algorithm for listing patients has evolved over the years: in 1988 there were two tiers; in 1989, there were three tiers; and in 2006, the system was modified for broader organ sharing. The current heart allocation system is based on 3 tiers of medical urgency: status 1A, status 1B, and status 2. Status 1A is given the highest priority on the waiting list; status 2 represents the more stable candidate, generally awaiting transplant at home. The field of heart transplantation has recognized the need to decrease time on the waiting list and related mortality. In 2015, a new system with six tiers was proposed and has undergone public comment and expert refinement.43 As of 2017, the OPTN and UNOS approved the revised adult allocation system with ongoing modification.

The cardiac physiology in a denervated heart is unique and deserves special attention.46 Normal cardiac physiology involves both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation by the autonomic nervous system. During heart transplantation, there is complete transection of neural axons to the heart, resulting in loss of cardiac norepinephrine reserves. Afferent denervation impairs the response to changes in cardiac filling pressures. Sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation is diminished by efferent denervation, resulting in an elevated resting heart rate and decreased inotropic and chronotropic responses to exercise. Normal sinoatrial (SA) node activity is often impaired after heart transplantation. Initially, many patients suffer from relative sinus bradycardia. This is often a result of trauma to the SA node following surgery, prolonged ischemic time, or amiodarone use in the recipient prior to heart transplantation. This is often treated with temporary cardiac pacing through surgically placed epicardial pacing wires. Terbutaline has been used with mixed results to temporarily increase resting heart rates following weaning from inotropes. Most patients are able to discontinue terbutaline within the first month after transplant; less than 5% of patients will require pacemaker implantation.",

When refractory hypotension is present despite optimal vasopressor support, methylene blue has been used to treat VS following heart transplantation.53 Methylene blue can be given as a single infusion over 20 minutes, typically 2 mg/kg as described by Leyh et al.54 Following infusion of methylene blue, patients may develop greenish discoloration of the urine and, occasionally, the skin.

Increased RV afterload or preload leads to ventricular dilatation and tricuspid valve insufficiency. Patients who are bridged to heart transplant with MCS are at increased risk for perioperative RV failure because of the technically more challenging surgical approach, increased blood product requirements, and prolonged ischemic time. Focal cardiac tamponade, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the presence of pulmonary hypertension can all cause acute RV failure. The failing RV often results in worsening venous congestion and subsequent renal, hepatic, and intestinal dysfunction. Treatment of RV failure includes volume optimization, inotropic support, afterload reduction, and mechanical circulatory support. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is commonly used postoperatively for heart transplant patients with elevated pulmonary pressures and RV dysfunction. The normal dose of iNO is 20 to 40 ppm and is typically weaned off prior to extubation. iNO can be very effective in the short term but has limitations with longer-term use. Therefore, other modalities to unload the right ventricle (such as milrinone, isoproterenol, nesiritide, and sildenafil) are also utilized.",

Box 48.8\nprovides a comprehensive list of risk factors. Universal acceptance of the PGD definition has allowed the development of targeted treatment modalities with the goal of reducing mortality (Table 48.3\n).

Studies have demonstrated that for every 1 mg/dL increase in creatinine, there is a 58% increase in graft failure at 1 year.59 Data from the UNOS registry suggest a serum creatinine greater than 2.5 is associated with twice the mortality risk at 1 year. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly encountered in the CICU following heart transplantation. Over 30% of patients develop clinically significant AKI following cardiac surgery.60 The pathophysiology of AKI following cardiac surgery is multifactorial, including, but not limited to, cellular ischemia leading to tubular and vascular endothelial injury, loss of autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate at mean arterial blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg, initiation of a systemic inflammatory response, and hemolysis-related kidney injury due to the generation of plasma-free hemoglobin and iron. Furthermore, anemia, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and the need for surgical reexploration can potentiate AKI. Preservation of kidney function and maintenance of adequate urine output is one of the most critical jobs of the cardiac intensivist. In the setting of escalating dosages of diuretics, there may be a role for short-term nesiritide to promote diuresis and maintain urine output. Intensivists must avoid nephrotoxic medications, prevent hypotensive episodes, and maintain euvolemia to help ensure successful recovery of kidney function following heart transplantation. Preservation of kidney function allows for optimization of immunosuppression and enhances graft survival. Despite best efforts, transplant patients may require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or even intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Most patients will regain renal function within 6 months. Long-term hemodialysis can significantly decrease quality of life. Individuals with an eGFR less than 30 prior to transplant should be considered for dual organ (heart/kidney) transplantation.",

CAV is a unique process with a pathophysiology different from traditional atherosclerosis. CAV occurs along a spectrum but continues to be a leading cause of long-term mortality beyond the first postoperative year.63 The development of CAV within the first 12 months confers a much higher mortality compared to individuals with no evidence of CAV. Early CAV is typically a diffuse process, affecting the distal vessels in the coronary vascular bed with little hope for successful intervention. Late development of CAV is much more likely to involve the proximal vessels and to be focal in nature. The pathophysiology suggests that both acute and chronic rejection play a significant role in the development of CAV. While many programs have various prophylactic regimens for CAV, the guidelines provide class I recommendations only for statin therapy and strict control of cardiovascular risk factors.62 The treatment of CAV with percutaneous intervention and, in rare situations, coronary bypass surgery is largely dependent on lesion location and length. Treatment beyond revascularization includes optimization of immunosuppression and the use of PSIs. Sirolimus and everolimus decreased progression of CAV; CAV is a clear indication to switch a patient from antimetabolites to PSIs. Patients with progressive CAV may develop such severe graft dysfunction that retransplantation is the only therapeutic option.",

The development of infection is delayed by prophylaxis and accelerated by intensified immunosuppression, drug toxic effects that may cause leukopenia, or immunomodulatory viral infections, such as infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). At the time of transplantation, a patient's short-term and long-term risk of infection can be stratified according to donor and recipient screening, the technical outcome of surgery, and the intensity of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection. Subsequently, an ongoing assessment of the risk of infection is used to adjust both prophylaxis and immunosuppressive therapy.
