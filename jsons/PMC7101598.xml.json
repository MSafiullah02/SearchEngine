            "text": "In April 2009, Mexico reported Influenza A virus outbreak. The virus was recognized as a novel reassorted H1N1 (swine-flu), also known as Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 or 2009 H1N1 Influenza A. Similar cases were subsequently reported worldwide [1]. By June 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert due to rapid spread of the virus [2]. By August 2009, over 254,206 cases worldwide had been reported, resulting in 2,837 deaths. Given that countries are no longer required to report individual cases, it is highly probable that the reported cases represent an underestimation of the actual incidence of this disease [3]. In contrast to seasonal influenza, mortality from Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 appears worse in infants and young adults and those with morbid obesity. In addition, pregnant women appear to be at higher risk of mortality [3, 4]. The French Institute for Public Health Surveillance epidemic intelligence team evaluated the characteristics of 574 Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1-related deaths showing that pregnancy and obesity are particularly concerning [4].",

During the late 1990s, multiple strains, including H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2, whose genes include combinations of avian, human and swine, were detected among North American pig herds [6]. Genetic analysis of the 2009 pandemic Influenza A H1N1 viruses suggested that introduction into humans was either via a single event or via multiple events leading to a combination of genetically similar viruses with a new Influenza A H1N1 as a new strain [7, 8].",

Early introduction of oseltamivir in the course of infection improves outcome, especially when Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 is sensitive to the drug. For instance, the patient in case 1 was treated within 24 h of presentation, whereas, the patient in case 2 was treated with levofloxacin before receiving oseltamivir. In fact, her CXR had shown signs of respiratory inflammation likely related to ongoing viral replication. Identification of Aspergillus (Case 2) also raises concern about prolonged immunosuppression and already existing lung damage. She died due to overwhelming ARDS. Machado et al. has described the beneficial effects of early administration of antiviral therapy in AHCT recipients showing that administration of oseltamivir up to 48 h from initial symptoms is likely to prevent influenza, albeit non-2009/H1N1 Influenza A, complications [9]. Chemaly et al. [10] showed that neuraminidase inhibitor therapy in patients with leukemia improves outcome of influenza infections.",

[16] reported outcomes of 21 episodes of influenza (influenza A = 8, influenza B = 13) in 19 hematopoietic allograft recipients. In their series, 18 (86%) of 21 episodes were treated with oseltamivir 75 mg twice a day for a median of 11 (interquartile range = 8\u201314) days and all of them survived [16]. Kobayashi et al. described a patient who developed influenza A 5 days prior to hematopoietic cell allografting. Interestingly, despite oseltamivir treatment at a dose of 75 mg twice a day for 5 days, the patient had recurrence of influenza A (by rapid diagnostic test) on post-transplant day +7 manifesting as upper respiratory symptoms accompanied by fever [17]. Subsequent treatment with oseltamivir for seven additional days resulted in resolution of symptoms and a negative influenza A rapid diagnostic test. The authors suggest that patients who develop influenza infections during the immediate pre-transplant period should be treated with antiviral therapy at least until successful engraftment is achieved [17].",

This could be minimized by early recognition of symptoms and emergency preparedness by oncology and bone marrow transplant services. It is essential that a framework of preparedness outlining steps to follow in the event of an outbreak is developed. A vigorous immunization campaign for household contacts and early therapy may be crucial. In the midst of an outbreak, it is essential to promptly identify patients with suspected infections and establish early treatment guidelines to prevent serious complications [18].",
