In light of this potential issue, the ABOS has modified its approach for the 2021 Case List collection process. This modification was designed to help those individuals whose practice caseloads have been negatively affected by the pandemic, ensuring each Candidate every opportunity to reach the caseload minimum and effectively represent their typical practice pattern. Based on the past year's applicant case logs, we estimate that more than 200 candidates would have failed to meet the minimum number of surgical cases performed in 6 months (35) to be eligible to sit for the examination. Thus, the case collection period has been expanded to make up for low volume months. The case collection period will be back dated to January 1, 2020, and extended until September 30, 2020. Starting with the first day in January, Candidates must collect and submit all consecutive surgical cases that they perform as primary surgeons for a minimum of six consecutive months. At that point, if the candidate has reached 250 or greater surgical cases, they can cease collecting. If not, they will continue to collect until 250 cases or the date September 30 is reached, whichever comes first.",

Orthopaedic surgeons have reached out to the ABOS offices inquiring as to opening the ABOS WLA Assessment window sooner than the expected date April 15 so that they could begin answering the assigned questions for their 15 Knowledge Sources. In response to the pandemic and our Diplomates' needs, we extended the time to participate by opening the examination window earlier (April 1, 2020) and making it available until June 1, 2020.
