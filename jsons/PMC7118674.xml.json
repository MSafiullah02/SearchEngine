From an immunological perspective, the Latin-American environmental condition characterized by a higher frequency of rains (like in Colombia and other tropical countries without the classic seasons), associated with a higher frequency of viral respiratory infections, caused by different types of viruses, could be related with a persistent exposition and training of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which allows an efficient response to respiratory viral infections, with better clinical evolution and, therefore, lower complications and mortality.7, 8, 9, 10\n",

Therefore, there is a widespread fear of the high impact on morbidity, mortality and social costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. However, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean. Some differences support this hypothesis in favor of Colombia, such as: a) a lower percentage of the population at risk (by age); b) a possible better immunological capacity (due to the greater exposure to outbreaks of respiratory infections during the year); c) the characteristics of tropical regions that reduces the speed of virus transmission, and d) earlier implementation of preventive health policies. Finally, it is essential to highlight the difference between being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presenting the COVID-19; in Colombia, as of March 19, 2020, only 8% of the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 required hospitalization, and no patients have required intensive care unit (Fig. 1).",
