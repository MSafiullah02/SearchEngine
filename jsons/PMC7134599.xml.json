            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory disease which was first identified in China's southern province of Guangdong. SARS is not merely a local endemic disease: it poses a serious risk to the medical community, is a threat to international travelers, is having a substantial negative economic impact in parts of East Asia and is spreading world-wide. The serious danger SARS poses to the medical community is illustrated by the numerous cases of transmission to health-care workers. Startlingly, the man who awakened the world to the dangers of SARS, Dr. Carlo Urbani, succumbed to the disease. Cases of transmission between aircraft passengers are suspected, and relatively short visits to epidemic regions have resulted in infection. The most striking feature of SARS, however, has proven to be its ability to rapidly spread on a global scale. One man with SARS made seven flights: from Hong Kong to M\u00fcnich to Barcelona to Frankfurt to London, back to M\u00fcnich and Frankfurt before finally returning to Hong Kong (Bradsher, 2003a). Another individual, a 26-year-old airport worker, appears to have transmitted the disease to 112 people (McNeil and Altmann, 2003). Clearly, there is an unfortunate interaction between the incubation period of the virus, the widely distributed severity and infectiousness of SARS in different people and the speed and volume of passenger air travel. The adverse economic impact in parts of East Asia far exceeds the disruption of previous outbreaks of avian influenza, earning comparison with the 1998 financial market crisis in that part of the world (Schoen, 2003; MSNBC News Service 2003a, MSNBC News Service 2003b). Although the causative agent of SARS has been determined (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003), a detailed understanding of the causative virus\u2019 pathogenticity and routes of transmission and the dynamics of the epidemic is still at a very early stage. It is uncertain how the virus is transmitted: by droplet or airborne transmission or person-to-person contact. The recent development of laboratory tests promises to improve the epidemiological situation somewhat (Gerberding, 2003).",

Its symptoms are similar to pneumonia or other respiratory ailments and include a high fever (\u2a7e38\u00b0C), shortness of breath, dry cough, headache, stiff or achy muscles, fatigue and diarrhoea (Stein, 2003b). These symptoms, however, are not uniform. In the US, for example, the disease seems to be a milder one than in Asia (Sloan, 2003).

However, it could also be transmitted through contaminated objects, air or by other unknown ways (CDC, 2003a).

            "text": "In this article, a simple model for SARS outbreaks is formulated (see Anderson and May, 1991 or Brauer and Castillo-Chavez, 2000). The model is used in conjunction with global and local SARS data to estimate the initial growth rate of the SARS epidemic. These rates are used to estimate SARS\u2019 basic reproductive number, R\n0, the classical epidemiological measure associated with the reproductive power of a disease. R\n0 estimates the average number of secondary cases of infection generated by a typical infectious individual in a population of susceptibles (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000) and hence, it is used to estimate the initial growth of a SARS outbreak. We estimate (using data from Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore) that R\n0 is about 1.2. This value is not too different from past estimates of R\n0 for influenza (see Castillo-Chavez et al., 1989) despite the fact that superspreaders of SARS have been identified. In fact, the parameter values resulting on this R\n0, on our population-scaled model, can lead to extremely high levels of infection. We show, via simple extrapolation, that the estimated rate of growth is consistent with the reported date for the first cases of SARS in Hong Kong, however the first cases in Toronto may be several weeks earlier than the February 23 date of the first case reported by the Canadian Health Ministries (Canadian Ministry of Health, 2003). Our best \u201crough\u201d estimate for Toronto is that the first case occurred sometime around January 29th, and not later than February 28th. The data for Hong Kong are fitted by fixing the parameters k, \u03b4 and \u03b3\n1 based on estimates of the observed rates for the corresponding processes. The growth rate \u03b2 is estimated from observed \u201cmodel-free\u201d exponential growth in Singapore and Hong Kong. The average diagnostic rate \u03b1 and the measure of heterogeneity between the two susceptible classes p and the effectiveness of patient isolation measures (related to l) are then varied to fit the initial data for Hong Kong and Singapore. To model the data in Toronto, we must postulate that the parameters describing the rate of diagnosis (\u03b1) and isolation (l) in the Canadian outbreak changed radically on March 27. Two hospitals in Toronto were closed about that time: Scarborough Grace Hospital on March 25th and York Central Hospital on March 28th (Private Communication, April 21st, 2003). The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 4 introduces the basic model and gives an R\n0 expression for the basic reproductive rate; Section 5 describes the results of simulations and connections to data; and, Section 6 collects our final thoughts.",

            "text": "Here we describe a model that incorporates, in a rather crude way, some of the important characteristics suggested in the literature (unequal susceptibility, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, mode of transmission, superspreaders, etc.) (CDC (Centers for Disease Control) 2003a, CDC (Centers for Disease Control) 2003b, CDC (Centers for Disease Control) 2003c; International Society for Infectious Diseases, 2003b). The goal is to use the results for single outbreaks as a first step in our efforts to gauge the global impact of SARS. Hence, we focus on three \u201cclosed\u201d populations (Southern Ontario (Toronto), Singapore and Hong Kong) and postulate differences in the degree of susceptibility to SARS (McNeil and Altmann, 2003; Stein, 2003b). These differences may be due to variations in contact rates, age-dependent susceptibility or \u201cunknown\u201d genetic factors. This last assumption is handled (in a rather crude and arbitrary way) via the introduction of two distinct susceptible classes: S\n1, the most susceptible, and S\n2, less so. Initially, S\n1=\u03c1N and S\n2=(1\u2212\u03c1)N where \u03c1 is the proportion of the population size N that is initially at higher risk of SARS infection. The parameter p is a measure of reduced susceptibility to SARS in class S\n2 (Stein, 2003b; McNeil and Altmann, 2003). E (\u201cexposed\u201d) denotes the class composed of asymptomatic, possibly infectious (at least some of the time) individuals. Typically, it takes some time before asymptomatic infected individuals become infectious. The possibility of limited transmission from class E is included, in a rather crude way, via the parameter q (see Table 1). The class I denotes infected, symptomatic, infectious, and undiagnosed individuals. I-individuals move into the diagnosed class J at the rate \u03b1. Individuals recover at the rates \u03b3\n1 (I class) and \u03b3\n2 (J class). The rate \u03b4 denotes SARS\u2019 disease-induced mortality. The classes R is included to keep track of the cumulative number of diagnosed and recovered, respectively. Furthermore, it is assumed that diagnosed individuals are handled with care. Hence, they might not be (effectively) as infectious as those who have not been diagnosed (if l is small). The parameter l takes into account their reduced impact on the transmission process (small l represents effective measures taken to isolate diagnosed cases and vice versa). Table 1 includes parameters\u2019 definitions and the initial values used. Our SARS epidemiological model is given by the following nonlinear system of differential equations:(1)\u1e601=\u2212\u03b2S1 (I+qE+lJ)N,\u1e602=\u2212\u03b2pS2 (I+qE+lJ)N,\u0116=\u03b2(S1+pS2) (I+qE+lJ)N\u2212kE,\u0130=kE\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b31+\u03b4)I,J\u0307=\u03b1I\u2212(\u03b32+\u03b4)J,\u1e58=\u03b31I+\u03b32J,which is referred to as \u201cSEIJR,\u201d after the variables used to name the classes (see Fig. 1).\n",

We did not explore the sensitivity of the model to variations in p and q because they are not known and cannot be controlled. All other parameters were roughly estimated from data (Canadian Ministry of Health, 2003; World Health Organization, 2003) and current literature (CDC (Centers for Disease Control) 2003a, CDC (Centers for Disease Control) 2003d; Fire Chief Magazine, 2003; C Health, 2003). In particular, the transmission rate \u03b2 is calculated from the dominant root of the third-order equation obtained from the linearization around the disease-free equilibrium (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000). The parameters l and \u03b1 were allowed to vary when fitting the data for each location (Singapore, Hong Kong and Toronto). Some restrictions apply, for example, the value of \u03b1>\u03b3\n1. We also require that 1/\u03b3\n2=1/\u03b3\n1\u22121/\u03b1, a statement that members of the diagnosed class J recover at the same rate as members of the undiagnosed class I. 1/\u03b3\n1 has been reported to be between 7 and 10 days (International Society for Infectious Diseases, 2003a; C Health, 2003). From the second generator approach (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000), we obtain the following expression for the basic reproductive number:(2)R0={\u03b2[\u03c1+p(1\u2212\u03c1)]}qk+1\u03b1+\u03b31+\u03b4+\u03b1l(\u03b1+\u03b31+\u03b4)(\u03b32+\u03b4)which can be easily given an epidemiological interpretation. The use of parameters estimated from Hong Kong (Table 1) gives a value of R\n0=1.2 (Hong Kong) and R\n0=1.2 (Toronto, assuming exponential growth) and R\n0=1.1 (Singapore).",

We assume that the population at major risk of SARS infection lives in Ontario's southern part (particularly Toronto), and is approximately 40% of the total population (\u03c1=0.4 in our model). It is worth pointing out that this value of \u03c1 is not critical (that is, the most sensitive) in the model. The \u201cmodel-free\u201d approximately exponential growth rates for the various regions of the world are roughly similar except for Canada from March 31st (day 61) to April 6th (beginning the day of the jump in the number of reported Canadian cases), the number of diagnosed cases grew \u223cexp (0.081t), where t is measured in days. This rate is substantially higher than elsewhere in the world. In the subsequent week (beginning April 7th, day 68) the number of probable or suspected Canadian cases rapidly rolls over to a smaller growth rate not too far from the rest of the world. We conclude, based on the coincidence of the Canadian hospital closures, the jump in the reported number of Canadian SARS cases on March 31st and the rapid rise in recognized cases in the following week, that Canadian doctors were rapidly diagnosing pre-existing cases of SARS (in either class E or I on March 26th). If we make the assumption that the fundamental disease spreading parameters other than \u03b1 and l are roughly constant throughout the world prior to March 26th, we can reach two important conclusions. Beginning on March 26th, in Toronto:\u2022\n\u03b1 changed from a number 1/\u03b1\u22481/\u03b3\n1\u22122\u22486 days to 1/\u03b1\n1\u2a7d3 days, and\u2022\nl changed from an uncertain and relatively large value l>1/2 to l\u2a7d0.1.\nIf we assume that the fundamental growth rate \u03b2 is essentially constant from one region of the world to another, it is difficult for our model to produce growth rates r well above the world average, except as a transient response to differences in diagnostic rate \u03b1 (due to delays in response or change in policy). Similarly, the SEIJR model requires fairly small values of l to achieve a rapid roll-over in the growth rate of recognized cases. The parametric details of how a \u201csecond\u201d initial condition for Toronto on March 26th is generated do not affect the qualitative aspect of this argument: the Canadian data prior to March 31st (the day of the large jump) are probably not as meaningful as data after that date, and hence only bound the model from below prior to March 26th. The essential aspect of this before-and-after hospital closure argument is that there were substantially more undiagnosed people in classes E and I than in class J on March 26th. This is a reasonable assumption given that the number of cases reported by Canadian officials more than double from March 30th to March 31st. The introduction of behavioral changes starting on March 26 (t=57 days), alters the fate of the disease in a dramatic fashion (see Fig. 3,\nTable 3).\n",

We then use our SEIJR model to examine the non-exponential dynamics of the Toronto outbreak.

The fitting of data shows that the initial rates of SARS\u2019 growth are quite similar in most regions leading to estimates of R\n0 between 1.1 and 1.2 despite the recent identification of superspreaders. Model simulations are fitted to SARS reported data for the province of Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore. Good fits are obtained for reasonable values of \u03b1, the rate of identification of SARS infections; \u201creasonable\u201d values of the control parameters l (a measure of isolation); possible values of p, a crude measure of reduced susceptibility (due to genetic factors, age or reduced contact rates); q a crude measure of the relative degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals; possible values of \u03c1 a measure of initial levels of population heterogeneity; and, reasonable values of N the effective population size. It is worth noting that for values of N larger than 100,000 the predictions (proportion of cases at the end of the outbreak, etc.) are roughly the same. The introduction of behavioral changes that follow the identification of the first case (reduce values of l at the time of the identification and moving aggressively to identify cases of SARS by increasing 1/\u03b1) result in a dramatic reduction in the total number of cases and on mortality in Toronto. Given the fact that SARS appears to kill between 3% and 7% of infected (diagnosed) cases (BBC News, 2003), it seems quite appropriate to isolate diagnosed people. Although we do not examine the effect of quarantine by varying q, it seems intuitive that quarantining those who came into close contact with positively diagnosed individuals will reduce the total number of cases.",

Recent disclosures (Pomfret, 2003c) reaffirm the importance of carrying out the analysis excluding data from China. We have redone the analysis including the data collected up to April 25 and, our conclusions, remain the same. Current data seem to support higher values for SARS induced mortality rates (BBC News, 2003). However, our model is most sensitive to the parameters l (effectiveness of isolation) and (\u03b1) diagnostic rate. It is not as sensitive to changes in \u03b4. In fact, the consideration of a 7% mortality (\u03b4\u22480.01) rather than 4% reduces the number of cases by about 12%. In Toronto, we have estimated 612 diagnosed cases with (l=0.05 and \u03b1=1/3 after March 26th). Perfect isolation after March 26th (l=0.00) reduces this number to 396 diagnosed cases. The assumption of homogenous mixing implies that our model is likely to overestimate the size of the outbreak. Hence, the situation in Toronto seems to support the view that this outbreak is being contained. Obviously, the case of the crude model (by design) cannot handle high levels of variability (a stochastic model would be desirable). This possibility is tested (as it is often done in deterministic models) by looking at the sensitivity of the model to parameters (\u03b1 and l being the most critical). Such sensitivity analyses can also help \u201cestimate\u201d the variability in R\n0.",
