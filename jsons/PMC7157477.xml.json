Next, we emphasize two aspects of model refinement, loop modeling and side-chain modeling, due to their relevance in ligand docking and rational drug discovery. We then discuss the errors in comparative models. Finally, we describe the role of comparative modeling in drug discovery, focusing on ligand docking against comparative models. We compare successes of docking against models and X-ray structures, and illustrate the computational docking against models with a number of examples. We conclude with a summary of topics that will impact on the future utility of comparative modeling in drug discovery, including an automation and integration of resources required for comparative modeling and ligand docking.",

The accuracy of a sequence\u2013structure match is assessed by the score of a corresponding coarse model and not by sequence similarity, as in sequence comparison methods.21 The scoring scheme used to evaluate the accuracy is either based on residue substitution tables dependent on structural features such as solvent exposure, secondary structure type, and hydrogen bonding properties,58\n,\n66, 67, 68 or on statistical potentials for residue interactions implied by the alignment.69, 70, 71, 72, 73 The use of structural data does not have to be restricted to the structure side of the aligned sequence\u2013structure pair. For example, SAM-T08 makes use of the predicted local structure for the target sequence to enhance homolog detection and alignment accuracy.74 Commonly used threading programs are GenTHREADER,66\n,\n75 3D-PSSM,76 FUGUE,68 SP3,58 SAM-T08 multitrack HMM,67\n,\n74\n,\n77 and MUSTER.78\n",

It is not necessary to select only one template. In fact, the use of several templates approximately equidistant from the target sequence generally increases the model accuracy.83\n,\n84\n",

For example, a method should allow for an easy recalculation of a model when a change is made in the alignment; it should be straightforward to calculate models based on several templates; and the method should provide tools for incorporation of prior knowledge about the target (e.g., cross-linking restraints and predicted secondary structure).",

In this range of overall similarity, loops among the homologs vary while the core regions are still relatively conserved and aligned accurately. Loops often play an important role in defining the functional specificity of a given protein, forming the active and binding sites. Loop modeling can be seen as a mini protein folding problem because the correct conformation of a given segment of a polypeptide chain has to be calculated mainly from the sequence of the segment itself. However, loops are generally too short to provide sufficient information about their local fold. Even identical decapeptides in different proteins do not always have the same conformation.111\n,\n112 Some additional restraints are provided by the core anchor regions that span the loop and by the structure of the rest of the protein that cradles the loop. Although many loop-modeling methods have been described, it is still challenging to correctly and confidently model loops longer than approximately 10\u201312 residues.105\n,\n113\n,\n114\n",

Improvements in implicit solvation models, such as the Generalized Born solvation model, motivated their use in loop modeling.

However, CASP assesses methods only over a limited number of target protein sequences, and is conducted only every 2 years.109\n,\n194 To overcome this limitation, the new CAMEO web server continuously evaluates the accuracy and reliability of a number of comparative protein structure prediction servers, in a fully automated manner.195 Every week, CAMEO provides each tested server with the prerelease sequences of structures that are to be shortly released by the PDB. Each server then has 4 days to build and return a 3D model of these sequences. When PDB releases the structures, CAMEO compares the models against the experimentally determined structures, and presents the results on its web site. This enables developers, non-expert users, and reviewers to determine the performance of the tested prediction servers. CAMEO is similar in concept to two prior such continuous testing servers, LiveBench194 and EVA.196\n,\n197\n",

In fact, comparative models have been used in virtual screening to detect novel ligands for many protein targets,201 including the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR),210\n,\n212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223 protein kinases,224, 225, 226, 227 nuclear hormone receptors, and many different enzymes.228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241 Nevertheless, the relative utility of comparative models versus experimentally determined structures has only been relatively sparsely assessed.212\n,\n224\n,\n225\n,\n242, 243, 244 The utility of comparative models for molecular docking screens in ligand discovery has been documented245 with the aid of 38 protein targets selected from the \u2018directory of useful decoys\u2019 (DUD).246 For each target sequence, templates for comparative modeling were obtained from the PDB, including at least one holo (ligand bound) and one apo (ligand free) template structure for each of the eight 10% sequence identity ranges from 20% to 100%. In total, 222 models were generated based on 222 templates for the 38 test proteins using Modeller 9v2.35 DUD ligands and decoys (98 266 molecules) were screened against the holo X-ray structure, the apo X-ray structure, and the comparative models of each target using DOCK 3.5.54.247 The accuracy of virtual screening was evaluated by the overall ligand enrichment that was calculated by integrating the area under the enrichment plot (logAUC). A key result was that, for 63% and 79% of the targets, at least one comparative model yielded ligand enrichment better or comparable to that of the corresponding holo and apo X-ray structure.245 This result indicates that comparative models can be useful docking targets when multiple templates are available. However, it was not possible to predict which model, out of all those used, led to the highest enrichment. Therefore, a \u2018consensus\u2019 enrichment score was computed by ranking each library compound by its best docking score against all comparative models and/or templates. For 47% and 70% of the targets, the consensus enrichment for multiple models was better or comparable to that of the holo and apo X-ray structures, respectively, suggesting that multiple comparative models can be useful for virtual screening.",

Li et al.231 subsequently used similar methods to develop nanomolar inhibitors of falcipain that are active against chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria. In a study by Selzer et al.232 comparative models were used to predict new nonpeptide inhibitors of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases in Leishmania major. Sixty-nine compounds were selected by DOCK 3.5 as strong binders to a comparative model of protein cpB, and of these, 21 had experimental IC50 values below 100 mmol l\u2212 1. Finally, in a study by Que et al.,240 comparative models were used to rationalize ligand-binding affinities of cysteine proteases in Entamoeba histolytica. Specifically, this work provided an explanation for why proteases ACP1 and ACP2 had substrate specificity similar to that of cathepsin B, although their overall structure is more similar to that of cathepsin D.",

The comparative model employed thrombin as the template, sharing only 34% sequence identity with the target sequence. Moreover, some residues in the binding site are significantly different; a trio of charged Asp residues in matriptase correspond to 1 Tyr and 2 Trp residues in thrombin. Thrombin was chosen as the template, in part because it prefers substrates with positively charged residues at the P1 position, as does matriptase. The National Cancer Institute database was used for virtual screening that targeted the S1 site with the DOCK program. The 2000 best-scoring compounds were manually inspected to identify positively charged ligands (the S1 site is negatively charged), and 69 compounds were experimentally screened for inhibition, identifying the 15 inhibitors. One of them, hexamidine, was used as a lead to identify additional compounds selective for matriptase relative to thrombin. The Wang group has also used similar methods to discover seven new, low-micromolar inhibitors of Bcl-2, using a comparative model based on the NMR solution structure of Bcl-XL.233\n",

            "text": "The applicability of structure-based modeling and virtual screening has recently been expanded to membrane proteins that transport solutes, such as ions, metabolites, peptides, and drugs. In humans, these transporters contribute to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, and often, mediate drug-drug interactions. Additionally, several transporters can be targeted directly by small molecules. For instance, methylphenidate (Ritalin) inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and, consequently, inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine, is used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).261 Schlessinger et al.262 predicted 18 putative ligands of human NET by docking 6436 drugs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG DRUG) into a comparative model based on ~ 25% sequence identity to leucine transporter (LeuT) from Aquifex aeolicus. Of these 18 predicted ligands, ten were validated by cis-inhibition experiments; five of them were chemically novel. Close examination of the predicted primary binding site helped rationalize interactions of NET with its primary substrate, norepineprhine, as well as positive and negative pharmacological effects of other NET ligands. Subsequently, Schlessinger et al.263 modeled two different conformations of the human GABA transporter 2 (GAT-2), using the LeuT structures in occluded-outward-facing and outward-facing conformations. Enrichment calculations were used to assess the quality of the models in molecular dynamics simulations and side-chain refinements. The key residue, Glu48, interacting with the substrate was identified during the refinement of the models and validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Docking against two conformations of the transporter enriches for different physicochemical properties of ligands. For example, top-scoring ligands found by docking against the outward-facing model were bulkier and more hydrophobic than those predicted using the occluded-outward-facing model. Among twelve ligands validated in cis-inhibition assays, six were chemically novel (e.g., homotaurine). Based on the validation experiments, GAT-2 is likely to be a high-selectivity/low-affinity transporter. Following these two studies, a combination of comparative modeling, ligand docking, and experimental validation was used to rationalize toxicity of an anti-cancer agent, acivicin.264 The toxic side-effects are thought to be facilitated by the active transport of acivicin through the blood\u2013brain-barrier (BBB) via the large-neutral amino acid Transporter 1 (LAT-1). In addition, four small-molecule ligands of LAT-1 were identified by docking against a comparative model based on two templates, the structures of the outward-occluded arginine-bound arginine/agmatine transporter AdiC from E. coli\n265 and the inward-apo conformation of the amino acid, polyamine, and organo-cation transporter ApcT from Methanococcus jannaschii.266 Two of the four hits, acivicin and fenclonine, were confirmed as substrates by a trans-stimulation assay. These studies clearly illustrate the applicability of combined comparative modeling and virtual screening to ligand discovery for transporters.",

Even the successful efforts appear to rely strongly on visual inspection of the docking results. Much work remains to be done to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of docking against comparative models. Despite assessments of relative successes of docking against comparative models and native X-ray structures,225\n,\n244 relatively little has been done to compare the accuracy achievable by different approaches to comparative modeling and to identify the specific structural reasons why comparative models generally produce less accurate virtual screening results than the holo structures. Among the many issues that deserve consideration are the following:\u2022The inclusion of cofactors and bound water molecules in protein receptors is often critical for success of virtual screening; however, cofactors are not routinely included in comparative models\u2022Most docking programs currently retain the protein receptor in a rigid conformation. While this approach is appropriate for \u2018lock-and-key\u2019 binding modes, it does not work when the ligand induces conformational changes in the receptor upon binding. A flexible receptor approach is necessary to address such induced-fit cases267\n,\n268\n\u2022The accuracy of comparative models is frequently judged by the C\u03b1 root mean square error or other similar measures of backbone accuracy. For virtual screening, however, the precise positioning of side chains in the binding site is likely to be critical; measures of accuracy for binding sites are needed to help evaluate the suitability of comparative modeling algorithms for constructing models for docking\u2022Knowledge of known inhibitors, either for the target protein or the template, should help to evaluate and improve virtual screening against comparative models. For example, comparative models constructed from holo template structures implicitly preserve some information about the ligand-bound receptor conformation\u2022Improvement in the accuracy of models produced by comparative modeling will require methods that finely sample protein conformational space using a free energy or scoring function that has sufficient accuracy to distinguish the native structure from the nonnative conformations. Despite many years of development of molecular simulation methods, attempts to refine models that are already relatively close to the native structure have met with relatively little success. This failure is likely to be due in part to inaccuracies in the scoring functions used in the simulations, particularly in the treatment of electrostatics and solvation effects. A combination of physics-based energy function with the statistical information extracted from known protein structures may provide a route to the development of improved scoring functions\u2022Improvements in sampling strategies are also likely to be necessary, for both comparative modeling and flexible docking\n",

For the comparison of the model with the actual structure (filled circles), two C\u03b1 atoms were considered equivalent if they belonged to the same residue and were within 3.5 \u00c5 of each other after least-squares superposition. For comparisons between the template structure and the actual target structure (triangles), two C\u03b1 atoms were considered equivalent if they were within 3.5 \u00c5 of each other after alignment and rigid-body superposition. The difference between the model and the actual target structure is a combination of the target\u2013template differences (green area) and the alignment errors (red area).
