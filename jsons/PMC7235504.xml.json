            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), the virus that causes COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID19; often written COVID\u201019), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China (Wu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Rapid, global spread of the virus is presently causing a pandemic. Currently, no drugs or antivirals are available and countermeasures are limited to non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Nucleic acid\u2212based tests for detection of the virus during acute disease are in use worldwide (Chu et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020). However, the development of serological assays is lagging due to lack of suitable reagents. Serological assays are needed to perform serosurveys aimed at determining the real infection rate and infection fatality rate in a given population. Furthermore, they are useful to characterize the immune response to the virus in a detailed qualitative and quantitative manner. Serological assays are also of immediate practical use. They can be used to identify individuals who were infected (including severe, mild, and asymptomatic cases) and who are now potentially immune. A recent study in non\u2010human primates showed that re\u2010infection, at least in the small number of animals used in the study, does not occur (Bao et al., 2020) once antibody responses have been mounted. Infection with coronaviruses circulating in human populations, such as HKU, NL63, etc., also leads to immunity that protects from re\u2010infection for months to years (Callow, Parry, Sergeant, & Tyrrell, 1990). Therefore, individuals who have mounted an immune response to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are likely immune, which means that they are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. As an example, healthcare workers who are immune could potentially care for COVID19 patients with minimal risk to themselves, their colleagues, and other patients. In addition, the use of convalescent plasma may serve as a valuable treatment option for patients with severe COVID19, especially in the absence of other options. A serological assay is critical for identifying potential plasma donors.",

Antibodies binding to the spike protein, and especially to the RBD domain, can neutralize SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Therefore, we used different recombinant spike protein preparations as the antigens for our ELISA. We reported in our earlier work that individuals not exposed to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are completely na\u00efve to the spike protein, and their serum samples show little or no reactivity in an ELISA (Amanat et al., 2020). It is, therefore, easy to distinguish between exposed/immune and na\u00efve individuals.",

We believe that these protocols will be useful not only for research laboratories around the globe, but also for testing in diagnostic/clinical laboratories. The described protocol setup works well for us, but it can easily be modified, adapted to local needs, and improved by the research community in the future. Not every aspect of these protocols has been optimized in detail, and we provide notes and comments whenever further optimizations and testing are recommended. Mammalian expression plasmids for the generation of the recombinant proteins are available from the corresponding author and from BEI Resources.",

Expression levels of the RBD are very high in our hands (>20 mg/L culture), while expression levels for the full\u2010length spike are lower (approximately 4 to 5 mg/L). Therefore, we use the recombinant RBD for initial screening ELISAs and the full\u2010length spike for confirmatory ELISAs (as described in Basic Protocol 2). The expression vector constructs were described previously (Amanat et al., 2020). In brief, the sequences used for both proteins are based on the genomic sequence of the first isolate, Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101, which was released on January 10, 2020 (GenBank: MN908947.3). Sequences were codon\u2010optimized for mammalian cell expression. The full\u2010length spike protein sequence was modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site, which is recognized by furin, and to add a pair of stabilizing mutations (Figure 2). These two modifications were included to enhance the stability of the protein based on published literature (Amanat et al., 2020). The plasmids are grown in E. coli at 37\u00b0C (or 30\u00b0C) at 225 rpm in Luria\u2010Bertani (LB) broth with ampicillin (LB\u2010amp) in shaker flasks overnight. High\u2010quality plasmid DNA can be obtained using commercially available maxiprep kits (ideally with an endotoxin\u2010removal step). Importantly, other cell lines (293T, CHO, etc.), other media, transfection reagents, and more sophisticated protein purification methods might be used as alternatives if available.",

This is followed by a second stage (\u2018b\u2019 steps below) in which positive samples from the first stage undergo a confirmatory ELISA against the full\u2010length spike protein (which is harder to express; therefore there is usually less available). For the second stage, a dilution curve is performed. Typically, if only one operator is available, screening ELISAs can be run in the morning (760 samples/10 plates per run) and confirmatory ELISAs can be run in the afternoon (140 samples/10 plates per run). Of note, we describe the assay here as it is set up in our laboratory. We use a plate washer and a plate reader, but no automated system. The protocol can be adapted to use with an automated liquid handler. In addition, one of the difficulties in setting up the assay is the availability of appropriate negative and positive controls. Negative controls are easier to come by, and can be serum pools taken before 2020. Positive controls can be convalescent samples from COVID19 patients or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) like CR3022 (ter Meulen et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2020). If no human sera or mAbs are available, mouse mAbs, mouse sera against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, other animal sera against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, or anti\u2212His tag antibodies (the proteins are His\u2010tagged) can be used. However, in this case, a different secondary antibody for the species from which the primary antibody is derived is needed for the positive control. Also, we recommend generating large batches of positive controls, which can be used for many runs. The positive control should be selected to result in a strong signal (recommend OD490 of about 2.0), and should be clearly distinguishable from the negative controls. ELISAs can be run with either serum or plasma.",
