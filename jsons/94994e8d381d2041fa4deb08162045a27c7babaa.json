As the sulfonamides and antibiotics were brought into medical and veterinary practice, resistance against these agents began to emerge. Resistance to antibacterial and antimalarial drugs is now widespread, and increasing resistance to antifungal and antiviral drugs is also a major concern. Our intention in this chapter is to give an outline of the genetic background to the problem of drug resistance; in Chapter 9 we describe the major biochemical mechanisms that give rise to resistance.",

As a result, we now have a fairly complete picture of the genetic factors underlying the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial populations. Although the study of the genetics of resistance in pathogenic fungi and protozoa is less developed, advances in DNA sequencing technology should bring about significant improvements in our understanding of these organisms. The depressingly rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants of the human immunodeficiency virus during the chemotherapy of AIDS has given a powerful impetus to the study of the genetic and biochemical basis of resistance to antiviral drugs. The early studies on the genetics of drag resistance were bedeviled by an exhausting controversy. On the one hand were those who believed that the development of a resistant cell population could be explained by the phenotypic adaptation of the ceils to an inhibitory compound without significant modification in their genotype. The opposing faction tooli the view that any large population of ceils which was sensitive overall to a drug was liliely to contain a few genotypically resistant cells. The continued presence of the drag resulted in the expansion of the numbers of resistant cells by a process of selection.",

There is also a mutator phenotype in some bacteria which ensm'es a much higher mutation frequency thannomial. An interesting example is that of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancers. As many as 33% of Helicobacter pylori strains show an abnomially high rate of mutation to antibiotic resistance. The nature of this high mutation frequency is not known at present, but it is of potential relevance to the clinical challenge of eliminating Helicobacter pylori from the stomach by treatment with antibiotics. When the vast numbers of organisms in microbial populations are considered, the probability of even low mutation rates causing drug resistance is quite high. The simple and elegant technique of replica plating convincingly demonstrates that spontaneous mutations to drug resistance can occur in drug-sensitive bacterial populations in the absence of drags (Figure 8 .2). A spontaneous mutation may occasionally cause a large increase in resistance, but resistance often develops as a result of numerous mutations, each giving rise to a small increase in resistance. In this situation, highly resistant organisms emerge only after prolonged or repeated exposure of the microbial population to the drug.",

The loss of sensitivity to an inhibitor can be associated with reduced catalytic efficiency, which places the virus particles at a competitive disadvantage compared with viruses with unimpaired enzyme. However, the reduction in enzymic efficiency may be compensated by further mutations which progressively restore enzymic activity. A recent alarming discovery is that under laboratory conditions, AZT and lamivudine adversely affect the fidelity of reverse transcriptase, thus further increasing the frequency of mutations. The clinical significance of this finding has yet to be explored. As discussed in Chapter 4, the clinical approach to coping with the rapid acquisition of drug resistance by HIV is to treat patients with a combination of drugs. In this way, the emergence of resistant viruses can be delayed by months or even years. Even so, the eventual emergence of viral populations resistant to multidmg therapy may be inevitable.",

The origins of drug resistance in HIV lie in the high rate of viral replication and the ease with which spontaneous mutations arise in its RNA genome. As a single-stranded RNA virus, HIV lacks a proofreading mechanism to eliminate sequence eiTors resulting from the low fidelity of HIV reverse transcriptase. As a result, mutations occur with high frequency. During the course of an infection, the combination of high replication and mutation rates pemiits rapid and extensive evolution of the viral population in response to immunological and chemotherapeutic challenges to its survival. For example, within weeks Originally it was believed that spontaneous mutations followed by the selection of resistant organisms in the presence of a drug explained the emergence of drugresistant populations. However, while this appears to be true in the case of HIV, the discovery that bacteria can acquire additional genetic material by conjugation, transformation and transduction led to the conclusion that spontaneous mutations make an important but not exlusive contribution to the emergence and spread of drug resistance in bacteria. Mutations underlie the upregulation of drug efflux pumps and the reduction or loss of porin function in many bacteria as well as the increased expression of constitutive p~lactamases in pathogens such as Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freiindii. Spontaneous mutations also lead to the progressive modification of p-lactamases, enabling The teclinique of replica plating reveals the existence of drug-resistant cells in a population that is overall drug-sensitive. A plain agar plate is heavily seeded with cells from the drug-sensitive culture and incubated until growth occurs. Cells ai'e transferred by a velvet pad to a plate containing the antibacterial drug; this plate is then incubated and the position of any colonies noted. The area on the drug-free plate cori'esponding to the location of the resistant colony on the drug plate is picked off and cultured in drug-free medium. Although still contaminated with sensitive cells, this culture will contain many more resistant cells than the original culture. Plating out of the ' enriched' culture on a plain plate followed by replication to a drug plate therefore reveals a higher number of drug-resistant colonies. The experiment shows that drug-resistant mutants occur in a bacterial population not previously exposed to the drug.",

Understandably, therefore, there is considerable interest in the origins of the genes that variously encode druginactivating enzymes, drug efflux pumps, enzymes that depress dmg sensitivity by the covalent modification of drug targets and proteins that block the binding of drugs to their targets. Antibiotic-producing bacteria, such as the streptomycetes, protect themselves against the toxic effects of their own antibiotics with enzymes that inactivate aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and p-lactams. In addition, many streptomycetes express p-lactamases even though they do not produce p-lactams, presumably as a protective measure against Plactams synthesized by other organisms in the microenvironment. Genes encoding the pumped efflux of tetracyclines, proteins that protect ribosomes against tetracyclines, and the enzymic modification of ribosomal RNA associated with resistance to erythromycin, have ail been identified in streptomycetes. Nucleic acid and protein sequence data support the suggestion that genes for aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes found in aminoglycoside-resistant clinical isolates may have originated from streptomycetes.",

In addition to point mutations, deletions and insertions, there is also the remarkable phenomenon of mosaic genes which arise by interspecies genetic recombination. By far the most common mechanism of resistance to p-lactam antibiotics is that of antibiotic hydrolysis by p~lactamases, which are probably of ancient origin. However, p-lactam resistance in several important pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, can also be caused by penicillin-binding proteins (Chapter 2) with reduced affinity for p-lactams. This type of resistance is relatively rare because the killing action of p-lactams depends on drug interactions with several high-molecular weight PBPs, and resistance therefore necessitates reductions in p-lactam affinity in each PBP. Although it is conceivable that such reductions in affinity could have arisen gradually from incremental changes in protein structure that were due to the accumulation of mutations in the PBP genes, it is clear that recombination amongst PBP genes from different species is a major cause of the low-affmity PBP phenotype in bacteria.",

The mosaics are created when regions essentially identical with those from penicillin-sensitive bacteria recombine with regions that have significantly divergent sequences. The mosaic genes encode PBP2 variants with decreased affinity for penicillin. Sequence information obtained from bacterial DNA databases show that the divergent regions in the mosaic genes originate from Neisseria flavescens and Neisseria cinerea. PBF2 prepared from specimens of Neisseria flavescens presewed from the preantibiotic era has a much lower affinity for penicillin than PBP2 from either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Neisseria meningitidis. The mosaic genes are thought to have arisen by interspecies recombination following transfoixnation by DNA released from lysed cells (see later discussion) amongst these bacteria. Mosaic genes encoding lowaffinity PBPs la, 2x, 2b and 2a have been isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to both penicillins and cephalosporins. Pneumococci are also readily transformable, and the divergent regions of the mosaic genes appear to have originated from several other bacterial species. However, not all low-affmity PBPs are the result of mosaic gene formation. An important example is that of PBP2a, which is encoded by the rnecA gene responsible for the notorious methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus. The mecA gene is located on a large (~50 kilobases) DNA element inserted into the bacterial chromosome. This so-called resistance island encodes proteins that are homologous with transposases and integrases (see later discussion) which probably catalyze both excision and integration of the mecA gene. Staphylococcus aureus may have acquired mecA by gene transfer from another organism.",

Evidence that drug resistance could be transferred from resistant to sensitive bacteria came from combined epidemiological and bacterial genetic studies many years ago in Japan. The first clue was provided by the isolation, from patients suffering from dysentery, of strains of shigella resistant to several drags, including sulfonamides, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Even more striking was the discovery that both sensitive and multiresistant strains of shigella could occasionally be isolated from the same patient during the same epidemic. Most patients harbouring multiresistant shigella also had multiresistant Escherichia coli in their intestinal tracts. This suggested that drug resistance markers might be transferred from Escherichia coli to shigella and vice versa. Subsequently it was confirmed that Gram-negative bacteria can indeed transfer drug resistance not only to cells of the same species but also to bacteria of different species and genera. As we shall see, the phenomenon of horizontal gene transfer, as it is now termed, is not confined to Gram-negative bacteria but also occurs in Gram-positive organisms. However, before we describe the transfer of drug-resistance genes between bacterial cells, we must first consider the movement of genes within the bacterial genome itself.",

This permits the exchange of genetic information only between closely related genomes. However, such a restricted phenomenon seemed unlikely to explain the widespread distribution of specific resistance determinants. It is now clear that the acquisition of genetic material by plasmids and chromosomes in both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria is not limited by classic recA-dependent recombination. Replicons, known as transposons, can insert themselves into a variety of genomic sites that often have little or no homology with the inserting sequence, although such transposition events are rare, one in 10^^-10^ cells per generation. Because there are many possible transposon, insertion sites in the bacterial genome, a higher frequency of insertion would probably result in too great a rate of gene disruption and mutation, in the simplest transposons, the whole of the genetic information is concerned with the insertion function. Insertion sequences (IS elements) are sequences of approximately 750-1600 base pairs encoding a specific endonuclease called a transposase. The IS elements are flanked by inverted repeats of 15-20 base pairs that are characteristic of individual transposons. Immediately adjacent to the inverted repeats are short direct repeats (5-11 base pairs) whose sequences depend on the target site where the transposon is inserted.",

These genes are again bounded by inverted repeats which in turn are flanked by short direct repeats (Figure 8 .3a). Tn3 (Figure 8 .3b) is a class 2, complex transposon which contains the genes for the transposase and for resolvase, an enzyme that catalyzes recombination between the insertion sequences.

The interaction between the cells triggers cleavage of a specific strand of the donor R-plasmid in the origin-of-transfer site (oriT) within a protein-DNA complex called the relaxosome, which contains the DNA strand-cleaving, or relaxase, enzyme. Only one strand, the T-strand, which is unwound following plasmid cleavage at the oriT, is transferred in a 5' to 3' direction from the donor to the recipient cell. Deteimining how the T-strand leaves the donor cell and penetrates the recipient has been a major research challenge. The extrusion of DNA from donor cells has some features in common with the secretion of toxins and virulence proteins referred to as the type IV secretory process. So-called coupling proteins are involved in transferring the exported proteins across the complex cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria into the external environment. A recent suggestion is that in a typical plasmid such as R388, after generation of the T-strand of DNA, the relaxase protein, TrwC, serves as a pilot to guide the T-strand into the type IV secretory pore. A coupling protein, TrwB, then 'pumps' the DNA strand through the transporterpore system, which perhaps involves ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. The details of the final transfer into the recepient cell remain shrouded in uncertainty, although the model suggests a possible role for the surface pili in breaching the peixneability baniers of the recipient cells. It must be emphasized, however, that this proposal is speculative and is supported mainly by circumstantial evidence on the nature of the coupling and pilot proteins and the effects of loss-of-function mutations in these proteins on the DNA transfer process. Once inside the recipient cell, the ends of the transfen-ed strand are ligated to produce covalently closed circular DNA. Finally, DNA replication, catalyzed by DNA polymerase III, generates doublestranded plasmid DNA from the single-stranded molecules in both donor and recipient cells.",

Resistance to these and to many other drugs is increased by the induction process. The MarA protein encoded in the operon belongs to a family of transcriptional regulators and controls the expression of numerous other genes, probably in concert with MarR, a regulator protein, and the MarB protein, whose function is currently unknown. The mar operon, when induced, upregulates the multidrug efflux pump AcrB and its linked outer membrane component, TolC (Chapter 7). The mar operon also increases the expression of niicF, an RNA molecule which slows the expression of the OmpF porin channel protein.

For example, there is a point mutation (R467K) which replaces lysine with arginine at position 467. Analysis of azole-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans showed that resistance was high when both gene copies canied the R467K mutation compared with heterozygotes in which only one allele was mutated. Resistance to the nucleoside analogue, 5-fluorocytosine in Candida albicans is also modulated by allelic differences. As described in Chapter 4, 5~FC is first converted in the cells to 5-flu~ orouracil by the enzyme cytidine deaminase. A mutation in one allele for this enzyme results in partial resistance to 5-FC because the unaffected allele continues to express the wild-type enzyme. The generation of cells homozygous for the disabled gene via mitotic recombination causes high-level resistance to 5-FC. In contrast, the haploid yeast Candida neoformans can acquire high-level resistance to 5-FC in a single step because there is only one copy of the gene for cytidine deaminase.

A plain agar plate is heavily seeded with cells from the drug-sensitive culture and incubated until growth occurs. Cells ai'e transferred by a velvet pad to a plate containing the antibacterial drug; this plate is then incubated and the position of any colonies noted. The area on the drug-free plate cori'esponding to the location of the resistant colony on the drug plate is picked off and cultured in drug-free medium. Although still contaminated with sensitive cells, this culture will contain many more resistant cells than the original culture. Plating out of the ' enriched' culture on a plain plate followed by replication to a drug plate therefore reveals a higher number of drug-resistant colonies. The experiment shows that drug-resistant mutants occur in a bacterial population not previously exposed to the drug.",
