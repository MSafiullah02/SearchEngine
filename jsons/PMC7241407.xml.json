Therefore, this research follows two objectives, development of a general microsatellite discoverer which can be used for different genomes, and analysis of the structures of both SARS-CoV-1 and that of Coronavirus-Covid-19 using this tool and revealing their differences. The final results will assist future investigations towards drug and vaccine design.

They are classified into three classes, microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites. Different researchers and practitioners disagree where to draw the separating line between microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites; however, the number 7 appears very often as the longest length of the core subsequences of microsatellites [3]. The core subsequence of microsatellites will be called motif, from here on. Another important feature of microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites is the number of repeats of the corresponding motifs. Once again, there is no clear-cut lower bound for the minimum number of repeats.",

The focus of this research is finding microsatellites with both a fixed number of tandem repeats and those in which the number of repeats vary in different individuals. The variability of the number of repeats in both microsatellites, which is called the number of repeats polymorphism, is a good candidate for an individual's DNA signature [6,7]. Could it be the case for different varieties of the coronavirus? This has to be investigated after at least the microsatellites are all detected and reported.",

The need for research is growing, and its priorities are being set [11]. With respect to urgent drug discovery, the immediate effort is focused on repurposing drugs (Y [12]. In this respect, the study of virus-host and human-human protein-protein interactome networks is said to be essential [13]; Y [12]. Another direction is the discovery of known patterns which have been the source of other diseases, in the genome of the Covid-19. It is estimated that there are 4.6 million microsatellites in the human genome [14]. Amplification of many of these microsatellites have been used for many purposes such as disease diagnosis or human observable characteristics segregation. Numerous researches have reported the association between different diseases and certain microsatellites [15,16]. For example, the instability nature of repeats in the microsatellites is associated with many kinds of cancer and a variety of disorders related to the nervous system's degeneration, such as Huntington's disease [17]. Even a repeat polymorphism in one of the genes, i.e., IL-lra, is shown to be associated with an increased possibility of osteoporotic fractures [18,19]. Having said so, accurately and efficiently locating microsatellites in a given genome or genomic sequence has been and still is an important issue.",

Generally speaking, the goal is either to find all kinds of tandem repeats [20] or a subset of classes of tandem repeats such as microsatellites [17] with a variable number of repeats in different individuals or without it. From a different point of view, the outcome is either exact or inexact and for the case of inexact, it could be statistical [21], fuzzy [22], based on distances such as Hamming or edit distance [20]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no document with a complete classification of methods for finding tandem repeats and the first objective of this research is presenting a new approach to finding these repeats and not reviewing and classifying existing methods.

It has the capability of using a seed-and-extend concept to detect similar repeats. To check the atomicity of the core sequence, it searches a long list of possible core sequences, which is a time consuming process. Although we noticed it does not detect microsatellites with overlapped cores, it is a good candidate for the comparison with the method which is developed here. However, it is a deficiency for sensitive situations such as Covid-19's genome study.",

A feature of mreps is that it can tolerate errors between repeated copies [20]. With the generality, of course, comes slowness, usage complexity, and inaccuracy. For the case of Coronavirus which is composed of a short genome, fuzziness and inexactness is a weakness of the method. However, the reason for including fuzziness in the search seems to be to decrease the time requirement. For this reason it is decided to include this software in the comparison part to show the superiority of our method even with respect to time.",

It is based on the preparation of a repeated set in advance, and comparing all possible subsequences of the input sequence against this set, and then perform further processing, if a match happens. In the default option of this tool, all microsatellites of core lengths 1 to 6 are detected. To build the repeat set, all possible combinations of k-mers, for k = 1 to 6, are generated, and each one is extended by contiguous repetition of the k-mer to 12 characters. A moving window with length 12 is initialized with the 12 first characters of the input sequence, and it searches in the repeat set. If it is found, further processing will follow to find all repeats; otherwise, the moving window is pushed one place forward and the process continues. The main difficulty with this approach is the search time in the repeat set, especially if microsatellites of longer core sizes are of users\u2019 interest. For example, if the core length is seven nucleotides, 47 rows have to be added to the repeat set. One other difficulty is that the tool is not capable of detecting microsatellites with a low number of repeats. For example, it would not be able to detect microsatellites with core size 1 in which the number of repeats are less than 12. It is possible to change the default values but, a high search time will persist and other problems may arise.",

The length of the input sequence could be as long as the whole genome and as small as a few nucleotides. The problem is to find all successive tandem repeats of the same core sequence, i.e., same motif. The core sequences of microsatellites are considered to be of length 1, 2, \u2026, or 7 nucleotides.

Therefore, the storage requirement forces the software to rely on the secondary storage which makes the time requirement intolerable. Besides, processing the links is another factor which adds to the computation time. In this research, a novel idea was developed which removes all the linked lists and instead, for each k-mer includes only three values in the KMHI table.

This 6-mer points to row number 3035 of the KMHI table. Suppose the same 6-mer is repeated 4 positions later, i.e., in Positions 409 to 414. This will point to the same row number 3035 of the KMHI. With respect to this row, we can guess that perhaps a microsatellite, actually GTTC, is forming, because two of them have been already observed.

For example, when a microsatellite with core subsequence TCG with 20 times repetition is reported, geneticists can easily interpret that for example, there is a microsatellite with core sequence CGT which is repeated 19 (or 20) times, and there is no need to highly increase the number of reported microsatellites.

The timing of all methods are measured with an Intel Xeon E5-6695 v3 2.3Gigahertz processor with a 64 GB main memory module.

In some cases, it is 3600 times faster, and in the worst case it is at least 2.6 times faster than the state-of-the art method. This offers a great advantage, because most genomic sequences are very long and previous methods may not be capable to perform their tasks in a tolerable period of time. The same discussion is true for main memory utilization; however, since other methods did not reported the memory utilization of their algorithms and the source codes (not the executable code) are not available, comparison is not possible.
