Our report is structured around four legal determinants of health, each of which powerfully affects health outcomes. We use the term legal determinants of health because it demonstrates the power of law to address the underlying social and economic causes of injury and disease. These four legal determinants show how law can substantially influence health and equity. We do not endeavour a systematic review of law in global health, but rather to advocate for, and demonstrate, the crucial value of law in advancing global health with justice. Finally, drawing on identified areas for reform, as well as principles of good governance and the right to health, we offer seven concrete recommendations for action.",

By embedding equity and accountability in all health systems, the law and the rule of law can achieve health coverage that is truly universal\u2014delivering the Sustainable Development Goals' promise to leave no one behind.5Although the ability to enforce compliance with international legal obligations is generally limited, and largely dependent on power dynamics and political will, creative mechanisms can foster compliance and help establish impetus for action.6Law can address the pressing health concerns of the 21st century, across diverse areas. From tobacco control, non-communicable diseases, and road safety, to health emergencies, law can implement fair, evidence-based interventions to save lives. The global health community should champion evidence-based legal interventions and build the research case for legal action.7Laws that stigmatise or discriminate against marginalised populations are especially harmful and exacerbate health disparities. The global health community must oppose laws that undermine the right to health and to equity.8To realise the full potential of law to advance global health with justice, the global health community should build legal capacity and establish a sustained dialogue with legislators, regulators, judges, civil society, and researchers.\n\n",

With the ability to effect real change at the population level, we argue, law should be considered among the key tools of the global health community. By providing insight on the legal determinants of health, our aim is to empower the global health community to strengthen its legal capacity, and to use law more strategically in the pursuit of health and equity. Globalisation has heightened risks to our health, but it also presents unprecedented opportunities to confront global health threats collaboratively, drawing on expertise and lessons learned within and among nation states.

Although many global health professionals will be familiar with legal measures as an emergency response to health crises, this is only one facet of law.5 Less well understood is the role of law in governing global health institutions, in resolving disputes, and in health promotion and protection. Even less visible are those uses of law that, while not necessarily designed to affect health, have a profound impact upon it. Understanding these forces, and how to harness them, will be vital to improving population health in the 21st century.",

The impact of law is felt not only in individual decisions (eg, of courts and tribunals) but also in statutes and regulations that operate at the population level (eg, agricultural subsidies, Universal Health Coverage [UHC], or mandatory seatbelt usage). As such, law can be a powerful tool for securing and advancing health and equity.

Whether driven by animus or unsupported by scientific evidence, bad laws can undermine individual and population health, while entrenching inequalities. They can exclude, stigmatise, and inappropriately punish individuals. Furthermore, they can constrict the space for dissent and debate, for an independent press, and for social action. In such cases, law reform is crucial\u2014but often difficult. The process of overturning old national legislation or adopting revised or new treaties often involves bitter and drawn-out struggles. New or better health laws can threaten the interests of powerful actors, including states, businesses, and lobbyists, who will vigorously oppose reform.

Therefore, the Commission has had to be selective, and, for this reason, is necessarily limited in scope. Our concept of legal determinants is not the only way to frame the topic. Rather, it reflects the Commission's views of what constitute the major dimensions of law in global health, in the present era.

Law can help to achieve the SDGs' unifying vision for global health and development. We illustrate the potential of law in advancing the SDGs through a case study on UHC. The second legal determinant is that law can strengthen the governance of national and global health institutions. The field of global health is complex, comprising a web of institutions, norms, and processes at the global, national, and subnational levels. Weak governance undermines leadership and coordinated action for health. Law can strengthen health governance, including transparency, benchmarks, and monitoring, with ongoing evaluation, civil society engagement, and accountability. The third legal determinant is that law can implement fair, evidence-based health interventions. Evidence-based public health laws\u2014effectively implemented and enforced\u2014can create the conditions for healthy populations. We offer key examples of effective laws across three health domains: infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries. We also show how law can undermine health and justice. The final legal determinant is that law can be used to build legal capacities and reinforce all the legal determinants of health. All the aforementioned determinants require stronger, mutually reinforcing linkages between law and health. Effective health laws are guided by science and translate the best available evidence on health improvement. Legal capacity building includes stronger legal institutions (legislatures, agencies, and courts), expanding the evidence-base with research evaluating the effectiveness of laws, and training key actors in law -making and law-implementing skills.",

International health-related rights\u2014such as the rights to health, privacy, and non-discrimination\u2014are enshrined in many regional and domestic legal frameworks, including national constitutions.41, 42 To fully realise the right to health, governments must implement measures through domestic law and regulation (panel 3\n). Broad international guidance requires detailed national policy making.Panel 3Case study of legal responses to infectious disease (hepatitis C)Despite enormous gains in the treatment of disease, the increasingly globalised nature of the world nowadays has made the spread of infectious diseases across borders a persistent, global public health challenge. In seeking to contain the spread of infectious disease, countries leverage a broad array of tools at their disposal. One important tool is the law, which poses unique challenges and opportunities in its role to help contain infectious disease. The global response to hepatitis C exemplifies some of these challenges and opportunities.Worldwide, approximately 70 million people live with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.43 In the last decade, the development of direct-acting antivirals has provided an effective cure in the form of oral, well tolerated treatment regimens for people with chronic hepatitis C virus infection; cure rates of over 95% have been achieved with direct-acting antiviral regimens.44 Despite the existence of an effective cure, the number of people treated for hepatitis C still remains a relatively small fraction of those infected or diagnosed.45, 46 Patent-related barriers that keep prices high substantially contribute to this problem.46\nDirect-acting antivirals have a wide range of patents, covering the chemical molecules, manufacturing processes, methods of treatment, and formulations.47 Patents covering various aspects of direct-acting antivirals prevent the entry of competitors, allowing originator companies to select the price for the market.48 Although these patents cover a broad range of features, the reality of country-specific patent regimes means that a patent granted in one country might not be granted by, or even filed in another country. In countries where patents are not filed or granted, local production or importation of generics is possible, and the competition from these generics, in turn, drops the price and increases access to the drug. An example of this was observed in Georgia and Morocco;49 in both countries, primary patents for the direct-acting antiviral sofosbuvir were not filed. As a result, generic companies could produce that drug, enter the market, and decrease the price of the drug.In countries where patents are issued, another set of options have been utilised by groups and countries to mitigate patent-related barriers. For example, some non-governmental organisations have been attempting to systematically test or undermine patents issued in certain countries to facilitate competition and access.46 Many national patent regimes provide the opportunity for third party filings, which serve as a way to register concerns about whether the compound has sufficiently met the requirements of patentability. Non-governmental organisation attempts to undermine patents have led to the rejection of key patent applications for direct-acting antivirals in Brazil, China, Egypt, and Ukraine.46, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58\nWhere patents exist and have been unsuccessfully challenged, another option available to groups and countries is voluntary licence agreements. These agreements formalise originator companies' permission to manufacture and sell generic versions of their drug regimens in specific countries or regions. As a result, countries included in originator companies' voluntary licensing agreements are able to access generic direct-acting antivirals from licencees at lower prices.53 For example, one manufacturer licenced its products to eleven generic manufacturers in India, facilitating the sale of generics in more than 100 countries.53\nCountries not included in voluntary licence agreements can still increase competition and access by way of other strategies. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS),54 an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization, acts to constrain actions for countries with respect to patents. However, countries do have the right under TRIPS to grant government use or compulsory licences in certain circumstances.54, 55 In September, 2017, Malaysia became the first country to issue a compulsory licence for a direct-acting antiviral.46, 52 After issuing the licence, Malaysia was then included in the voluntary licence agreement of some manufacturers.56\nThe net effect of this global patchwork of patent laws and policies is, on the one hand, a steep price cut in low-income and middle-income countries, and, on the other hand, a slowly declining price trend in upper middle-income and high-income countries.46 The former is promising because more than 60% of people with hepatitis C nowadays live in a country that could access generic direct-acting antivirals.46 However, not all countries that can access more affordable generic treatments do, and, still more troubling, although some competition has altered prices in upper middle-income and high-income countries, high prices of direct-acting antivirals continues to impede access to an effective cure.46\n",

However, judges have limited facts and perspective: they must adjudicate according to the parties and evidence in front of them, rather than considering issues at the population level. Are judges better placed to decide on the allocation of scarce health resources than elected officials? When is it appropriate for a court to decide that an individual litigant is entitled to access pharmaceuticals not listed on the government's or WHO's essential medicines registries?",

In Minister of Health versus Treatment Action Campaign (2002), the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that government limits on the public sector provision of nevirapine were unreasonable and unconstitutional. Nevirapine halves perinatal HIV transmission rates. The Court found that limiting access was a breach of the right to health care, which was not consistent with a positive state obligation to progressively realise the rights of mothers and infants to essential health services.60 Similarly, the Venezuelan Supreme Court (1999) required the State to provide HIV treatment and to develop social awareness campaigns.61 In 2000, the Argentine Supreme Court found that the \u201cright to health falls within the right to life\u2026the first natural right of the individual\u201d, and directed the government to provide HIV treatment.62 These cases, along with other right to health litigation, have contributed greatly to social movements.63\n",

Modelled on the cases described above, individuals have increasingly launched health rights litigation around the world on issues including reproductive rights, mental health, and smoking in public places.64 Notably, this litigation often occurs in the context of democratic failure: litigants turn to the courts because corruption, autocratic practices, and the dominance of powerful interests provide little opportunity for changing policies through the political system.65 Although gaining traction,66 the justiciability of the right to health (ie, the question whether or not a court can adjudicate a claim brought on the basis of the right to health) remains a contested issue in many jurisdictions.64 The long-term effects of litigation on equity and justice are not yet clear,64 and are dependent on context. For example, one study of litigation in a southern Brazilian state concluded that \u201cjudicialization largely serves the disadvantaged who turn to the courts to secure a wide range of medicines.\u201d67 However, in other cases, courts have granted individuals access to expensive medications, some of which have little demonstrated value. When courts override careful policy assessments by the legislature, they might divert resources for health that could otherwise have been used for more cost-effective interventions. Consequently, scholars have noted: \u201cCourts in adjudicating health human rights need to frame the right in the context of the larger equity and solidarity goals of a public health care system\u2026one danger with a rights-based approach is that it can reinforce the individual demands for high-priced treatments, thus exacerbating the difficulties governments have in running fair and efficient health care systems.\u201d68\n",

The 1991 Constitution enshrined economic and social rights, establishing a Constitutional Court as a specialised tribunal to oversee the new constitutional jurisdiction. This gave individuals the right, when economic and civil rights were not being met, to take the government to court through a writ called a tutela.69\nTutelas give citizens an avenue to ensure that the government actively provides for their constitutional rights, including rights to health care.However, health-related tutelas rapidly overwhelmed the tribunal. According to a report by the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, between 1999 and 2008 there were 674 612 actions for protection of constitutional rights in relation to health issues.70, 71 Additionally, rather than creating a more equitable dispute resolution system for all Colombians, tutelas were often exploited by members of the wealthier class.72 The Colombian Constitutional Court subsequently issued a sweeping decision to improve the equity and oversight of the health system and stem the tide of litigation.73\nThe decision provided necessary definition and limits to the right to health for Colombia. Moreover, the Colombian Court had to carefully assess the practical and financial burden its decision would have on the government. As scholars have noted, \u201cif health-related rights are treated as unconditional and not limited by resource capacity, this can put an unsustainable burden on public insurers and undermine the ability to [act] as wise stewards of public resources through negotiating prices or resisting patent extensions and so forth\u201d.68\n",

A mandate refers to the explicit, implied, and customary powers and responsibilities of an organisation.82 A state's constitution defines the government's obligations to safeguard the public's health and to protect personal freedoms and rights. Constitutions often establish branches of government, allocating power among them (and setting limits on those powers), and delineating responsibilities. Statutes establish a country's key agencies, such as the Ministry of Health, defining its mandate and powers, while allocating funds for its operations. Treaties establish and govern international institutions, such as WHO. The WHO constitution is a legally binding treaty that defines the organisation's mission, scope of its organisational activities, and the responsibilities of its organs (assembly, executive board, regional and country offices, and secretariat). A corporation's mandate\u2014that is, the purpose for which the corporation has been established\u2014is set out in its charter or founding documents, such as a Memorandum of Association. Corporations are formed under provincial or federal laws that specify their fiduciary duties, duties to report and pay tax, and other responsibilities. Statutes and regulations can define the activities, structure, and limitations of a not-for-profit organisation with a global health mission. Non-governmental organisations must abide by the legal parameters set for their operation. The proliferation of institutions working in global health has added a new level of complexity, which includes the overlapping mandates of public, private, and non-governmental organisations, and public\u2013private partnerships.

Under this principle of government, \u201cseparate branches are empowered to prevent actions by other branches and are induced to share power.\u201d83 The law specifies the powers of each branch and the ways in which each branch can limit the powers of the others. The actions of legislatures and agencies are often subject to judicial review, but the legislature can override decisions of judges (other than with constitutional rulings). Checks and balances are crucial to the rule of law (panel 5\n).84\nPanel 5Checks and balances and the rule of lawThe rule of law is central to achieving health with justice, and systems of checks and balances are central to the rule of law. Although checks and balances are often codified, this is not always the case. The World Justice Project notes: \u201cgovernmental checks take many forms; they do not operate solely in systems marked by a formal separation of powers, nor are they necessarily codified in law. What is essential, however, is that authority is distributed, whether by formal rules or by convention, in a manner that ensures that no single organ of government has the practical ability to exercise unchecked power\u201d.84\n",

In response, governments have devised mechanisms to balance intellectual property protection with greater access to medicines.85 Therefore, national legislation on medicines procurement or patentability criteria, as well as TRIPS flexibilities, have sought to expand social goals, while recognising private rights.86 Yet further scope remains for countries to use the flexibilities that TRIPS provides to enable greater access to medicines.87\n",

The discrepancy for women was nearly as wide at 9\u00b75 years.121 The WHO views UHC as among its highest priorities.8, 117, 122, 123, 124, 125 In 2005, the 58th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted a resolution for sustainable health financing, universal coverage, and social health insurance, calling on countries to plan for the transition to UHC.126 Since then, UHC has become a global priority and a central element of WHO's efforts to strengthen health systems and improve the quality and distribution of health and health services.127, 128, 129 With the UN General Assembly adopting the SDGs in September, 2015, UHC became a global target, which will be reinforced by the UN high-level meeting on UHC in 2019.130 SDG 3\u00b78 views UHC as \u201cfinancial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all\u201d.113 SDG 3\u00b78, if fully implemented, would help realise the universal right to health.",

First, independent statutory authorities are tasked with reviewing clinical and epidemiological evidence and providing advice to governments about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments and technologies\u2014for example, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Second, administrative agencies are tasked with determining which medications are placed on formularies, and the amount or extent of any government subsidy. Third, legislation can specify which services, or categories of services should be provided under a UHC scheme. Finally, courts and tribunals can make de-facto decisions on service prioritisation. In South Africa, the Constitutional Court required access to antiretroviral medication for pregnant women,60 while in Brazil the judiciary has ruled on numerous claims of denial of access to medicines.

However, the potential to deliver health with justice is weakened by multiple governance challenges: fragmentation and overlap, poor compliance and enforcement, and disjunctions between actors with great influence over global health and the regimes intended to govern them. In this section, we have built on the work of the Lancet-Oslo Commission, specifically identifying ways in which law could strengthen good governance for global health. We have identified measures to harmonise institutional mandates, mechanisms for review of decisions, forums for ensuring international policy coherence on health, and innovative compliance-enhancing arrangements. In each of these ways, law can address vital governance challenges in global health. Specifically, recommendation 3 proposes that the UN set good governance standards for UN specialised agencies and programmes, including WHO. This proposal is supported at the national level by recommendation 4, which states that governments should develop legal frameworks establishing principles of good governance throughout national health systems and policy making.",

            "text": "Countries are adopting population-level salt reduction strategies to achieve WHO's 30% reduction target by 2025. Many of these focus on reductions at the manufacturing level (reformulation), complemented by public information campaigns and nutrition labelling. The strategies also use diverse regulatory forms. In 2006, the UK became the first country to set salt targets for food composition. Using a voluntary approach, but with strong government leadership and oversight, UK manufacturers agreed to progressive reduction targets for around 80 categories of processed foods. Their reformulation efforts were supported by consumer education and improved food labelling. The approach was highly successful, resulting in a 15% decrease in salt intake across the population.239 South Africa was the first country to set legislatively mandated salt reduction requirements across a wide range of processed foods. In March 2013, the South African Minister of Health issued the Regulations Relating to the Reduction of Sodium in Certain Foodstuffs and Related Matters.240 The requirements took effect on June 30, 2016, with more stringent maximum levels coming into force on June 30, 2019.240 Argentina has used a combination of voluntary and mandatory salt reduction techniques. Initially, the Ministry of Health and large food companies signed a voluntary agreement in 2011 to gradually and progressively reduce sodium in processed foods.241 Voluntary targets were set according to the category of food, with reductions ranging between 5\u201318% over a 2-year period, and a government campaign supporting and encouraging behaviour change. In 2013, to build on the success achieved through the voluntary scheme, Argentina enacted a national law regulating the sodium content of processed foods. As of 2019, 83 countries have salt reduction strategies in place or planned, including 35 countries with voluntary targets and nine with mandatory, legislated targets. Almost all countries use a multifaceted regulatory approach, with 70 counties implementing, or planning to implement more than one type of strategy, and 33 countries incorporating legislative initiatives such as taxes, maximum limits, or warning labels.242 Programmes are now being implemented in countries across all WHO regions and across countries with a broad range of income levels.242 An example of these changes is described in the case study of the regulation of sugar-sweetened beverages (panel 7\n).Panel 7Regulation of sugar-sweetened beveragesSugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), generally defined as liquids with added sugars (soft drinks, sports beverages, energy drinks, sweetened waters) are a known contributor to a variety of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, tooth decay and cavities, and gout.243 In response to the non-communicable disease epidemic, countries have begun to regulate SSBs, primarily through excise taxes, which add a per ounce fee to the SSB sales price, although traditional sales taxes have sometimes been employed.244, 245 The trend toward taxation has increased substantially over the past decade, and particularly during the past 5 years. As of 2019, more than a dozen countries, including France, the UK, Norway, Portugal, Chile, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and Mexico, along with numerous localities, have adopted sugar taxes of varying scope and size.246\nTwo of the most studied tax cases were in Mexico and Berkeley, California. Mexico was among the first countries to implement a substantial tax on SSBs, in 2014, levying a 10% excise tax on all SSBs except milk. Researchers found an immediate reduction in SSB consumption during the following years, with sales of SSBs falling by 5\u00b73% in 2014 and 9\u00b77% in 2015, while sales of untaxed beverages increased in 2014 and fell by only 1% in 2015.247 In Berkeley, which adopted a 1 cent per ounce tax on SSBs, researchers found that SSB sales decreased by 9\u00b76% while untaxed beverage sales increased by 3\u00b75%, driven primarily by a 15\u00b76% increase in sales of bottled water.248 Importantly, the tax did not seem to meaningfully affect overall consumer shopping habits, as average grocery bills did not increase, and Berkeley store revenue did not decrease compared with control cities. Multiple studies (in addition to those in Mexico and Berkeley) found that SSB taxes lead to moderate reductions in consumption, which could support positive downstream health outcomes.249\nWHO supports adoption of SSB taxes as a strategy to help combat non-communicable diseases, particularly obesity and diabetes, citing evidence that an SSB tax that increases consumer prices by 20% can lead to an approximate 20% reduction in consumption.249 Crucially, researchers have cautioned that SSB taxes must be relatively high to reduce consumption; at lower levels retailers could elect to absorb the cost of the tax in order to retain customer business, particularly if customers are readily able to purchase comparable goods from a nearby retailer in a location without such a tax.250\nSupporters of SSB taxes often argue that improved population health resulting from SSB taxes will eventually reduce health-care costs. WHO cites estimates that, over 10 years, a tax on sugary drinks of 1 cent per ounce in the USA would result in more than US$17 billion in health-care cost savings.249 Supporters argue that the revenue generated by SSB taxes can offset health-care expenses. For example, WHO cites estimates that an SSB tax of \u00a51 (US$0\u00b716) per litre in China would generate an estimated \u00a573\u00b76 billion (US$11\u00b78 billion) in revenue.249\nAs policy makers have become more interested in taxation and other regulation of SSBs, so too has the beverage industry, adopting creative techniques to forestall new regulation. For example, in response to local efforts to implement SSB taxes within California (the largest state in the USA, with over 39 million residents), the beverage industry engaged in an aggressive and ultimately successful strategy to preempt local taxation authority. In California, the generally liberal state government would normally be unlikely to adopt a state wide ban on new soda taxes. However, in 2018, the beverage industry deployed a two-pronged effort to curb local SSB taxing authority, first, by financing a ballot initiative in support of a sweeping preemptive tax law251, 252 that would have been devastating to localities, and later, by agreeing to withdraw the proposed initiative if a more narrow food and beverage tax ban bill passed, a move that was characterised by some legislators as \u201cblackmail\u201d and \u201cbeing held hostage\u201d.253\nThe industry's forceful techniques were effective. In June, 2018, the California legislature passed a bill preempting any new local food or beverage taxes for 12 years,254 joining Michigan and Arizona in adopting state wide bans on new soda taxes. Several other states in the USA have considered such bills, and the industry appears likely to continue to lobby in support of their passage in the USA and globally.The California example is emblematic of the challenges facing policy makers and health advocates. Although research shows that SSB taxes are an effective legal tool to help combat the non-communicable disease epidemic, the industry has mobilised to defeat any important new regulation. With industry willing to spend heavily in support of its objectives, public health advocates must be prepared for a more difficult path toward adoption of future SSB taxes.",

Such interventions include energy-absorbing crumple zones on cars, passive restraints, visible roads with clear lane markings, traffic separation (eg, oncoming vehicles or bicyclists), and traffic calming (eg, roundabouts and speed bumps). However, few countries have systematically implemented laws that target behavioural risk factors and design features, or laws that implement best practices. In particular, low-income and middle-income countries often have substandard laws, and poor compliance and enforcement.267\n",

The following year, the UN General Assembly adopted its own resolution, A/60/5, similarly calling for mandatory seatbelt legislation.

The UK and many US states have had such laws in place since the late 1960s and early 1970s; however, many states in the USA have since repealed their helmet laws, which has significantly increased head injuries. Helmet laws have been proven to be highly effective, reducing the risk of head injuries by 69% and the risk of death by 37%.271 In 1997, Taiwan introduced legislation making it compulsory to wear a motorcycle helmet. The government supported this legislation with, on one hand, a public information campaign, and on the other, strict fines for both riders and passengers.272 The results have been powerful: between 1991 and 2008, motorcycle-related deaths almost halved (from 7322 to 3646), despite an increase in both motorcycle use and crashes during the same period. In 2007, Vietnam introduced a similar law,273 supported by large fines for non-compliance. The Ministry of Health in Vietnam and WHO reported that road traffic head injuries and deaths had decreased by 16% and 18%, respectively, 3 years after the law was introduced.274\n",

The international legal drug control system is comprised of three treaties: the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. Countries have a two-pronged obligation: to ensure adequate availability of drugs for medical and scientific purposes, while also preventing illicit production, trafficking, and use of such drugs.278 Although the drug conventions require governments to take steps to reduce supply and demand for controlled drugs, these efforts must be balanced with countries' human rights obligations,279 including their citizens' rights to health, dignity, and freedom from arbitrary detention.The UN Office on Drugs and Crime has stated that the UN drug conventions do not require penalisation of drug use or drug possession for personal use,280, 281 and the system is grounded in a health framework explicitly stating that the \u201chealth and welfare of mankind\u201d is its overarching concern.282 Despite this, countries across the globe use criminal law measures to try and address the reduction of demand prong of their obligations\u2014including 33 countries that maintain the death penalty for drug-related offences.283 In many countries, sentences for minor drug dealing are longer than sentences for serious acts of violence such as murder, rape, or armed robbery,284 and people imprisoned on drug-related charges make up a substantial proportion of prison populations worldwide.282 In many countries, punitive drug control efforts have resulted in serious human rights abuse, including torture and ill treatment by police, mass incarceration, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and denial of essential medicines and basic health services.282\nThe criminalisation of drug use has facilitated the spread of blood-borne viruses, particularly HIV, among drug users. Some of the most severe drug-related harms are associated with injecting drug use. Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, up to 30% of all new HIV infections occur among people who inject drugs with unsafe injecting practices.285 In fact, HIV prevalence in countries that rely on punitive approaches is substantially higher (37\u201342% vs less than 5%) than countries that use public health approaches to drug use.275 Furthermore, criminalisation has also been used to limit access to treatment options. Drug control efforts often have a disproportionate effect on vulnerable groups and marginalised communities, including indigenous populations, the poor, and racial or ethnic minorities.286 In some countries, including the USA, treatment for hepatitis C has been restricted on the basis of a person's active injecting status. Criminalisation has also resulted in reduced access to disease prevention interventions, and proliferation of high-risk drug use behaviours in the absence of accessible harm reduction technologies.",

Beyond lack of any therapeutic intent, incarcerating people with a mental health disorder results in further marginalisation and discrimination of an already vulnerable group (panel 9\n).Panel 9Law as a tool to support improvement of mental health disordersWHO defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which every individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community\u201d.288 The WHO and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation category of mental health and substance use disorders encompasses several conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual developmental disability, and alcohol and drug use disorders.Globally, the burden of mental health disease is substantial. Approximately 15\u201320% of the world's population have one or more mental or substance use disorders;289 in 2016, approximately 1\u00b71 billion individuals had a mental or substance use disorder. Some argue that the true burden of mental health and substance use disorder is even higher because of factors such as difficulties in accurate measurement and reporting, along with challenges in categorisation of overlapping conditions.290\nMental health is neglected in most countries, particularly in relation to physical health conditions. Individuals with mental health disorders face pervasive stigma and discrimination, resulting in considerable disparities between the services available for physical and mental health, with decreased availability, accessibility, and quality of mental health services.290\nAlthough countries vary widely in access to mental health services, even the best performing systems have yet to meet the need, leaving a wide treatment gap between the need for treatment and actual service delivery. Estimates range from 76% to 85% of people with mental disorders not receiving treatment in low-income and middle-income countries, compared with 50% of comparable individuals in high-income countries.291\nWHO has identified the development of mental health policies and laws that promote human rights as crucial to the protection of people with mental health disorders, observing that such policies and laws are inadequate in most countries.292 WHO's Mental Health Action Plan 2013\u201320 set a target that 50% of countries should have developed or updated their mental health laws in line with international and regional human rights instruments by 2020.293\nAlthough successful mental health policy involves myriad components, a foundational issue is access to affordable, quality mental health services, which requires laws supporting such access along with adequate funding for services. Historically, countries devoted their scarce mental health resources almost exclusively to high-cost inpatient services for relatively few acute cases, which has contributed to the treatment gap. As evidence has shown the effectiveness of community-based outpatient treatment and integration of mental and physical health services, countries are slowly transitioning their laws and policies accordingly.A notable example is the UK's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. Initiated in 2008, the IAPT programme provides evidence-based outpatient services to people with anxiety or depressive diagnoses. The programme has several unique features, including mandatory use of standardised evidence-based protocols with intensive clinical supervision and, crucially, providing the services free of charge at the point of care.294 The UK invested \u00a3400 million in the programme from 2011 to 2015, and data indicate that about 950 000 people per year access IAPT for an initial assessment, of whom more than 537 000 receive therapy.295 This increase in access has helped narrow the treatment gap by improving treatment rates for adults with anxiety or depression from 24% in 2007 to 37% in 2014.294, 296\nAnother example of a law designed to improve mental health is India's Mental Healthcare Act of 2017, a broad bill that seeks explicitly to comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. India has traditionally underfunded its mental health services, spending only 0\u00b706% of its total health expenditures on outpatient mental health care,297 and has a severe shortage of mental health providers, even when compared with other low-income and middle-income countries.298, 299 Among the new law's provisions is a requirement that insurers cover mental and physical health services in parity, which supporters hope will help combat the stigma surrounding treatment and lead to improved mental health outcomes.The ongoing stigma surrounding mental health conditions and continued shortfalls in funding mean that change will come slowly, but the actions of countries such as the UK and India show that targeted laws can help speed progress toward improved mental health outcomes, particularly when coupled with adequate resources.",

            "text": "Laws in other realms can also adversely affect the public's health. Many countries ban or restrict access to health services for non-nationals\u2014particularly, but not only, undocumented immigrants. The law can also undermine the health of migrants in other ways. For example, immigration laws often require deportation of non-citizens infected with tuberculosis, which drives the population underground (panel 10\n).Panel 10The effect of international law on the health of refugees\u2014the case of tuberculosisNowadays, the world is facing the highest levels of displacement on record.307 With an unprecedented 68\u00b75 million people around the world forced from their homes\u2014of whom, nearly 25\u00b74 million are refugees and 10 million are stateless people\u2014the origins and consequences of the displacement crisis remain some of the most formidable challenges of our modern time.307 Attempting to address the myriad challenges that face refugees and asylum seekers across the world, the international community, by way of international law and treaties, has sought to foster norms on how countries treat refugees. The core instruments of international refugee law\u2014the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1967 Protocol308\u2014provide protection for refugees by prohibiting refoulment of refugees, or forcible returning of refugees to places where they fear for their lives or freedom.309\nAlthough the law has taken important steps to protect the wellbeing of refugees, profound gaps persist and negatively affect the rights and experiences of refugees, particularly with respect to health. Yet even more troublingly, laws and policies themselves can hinder health outcomes and contravene well established public health principles. This twin dynamic of unmet need and avoidable harm is exemplified in national laws and policies surrounding refugees and tuberculosis.310\nFrom the start of the journey, through to arrival at the country of asylum, refugees and others who are subject to forced migration are susceptible to contracting tuberculosis. This vulnerability begins with refugees' experiences in their home country, where health-care infrastructure might be lacking or have broken down because of war. For example, before the 2011 crisis began, Syria had a relatively low burden of tuberculosis.311 Although data regarding tuberculosis in Syria remains elusive, reports show a rapid rise of the disease in the country, which is still believed to only be a fraction of the actual burden.311, 312\nAfter refugees leave their home country, the journey exacerbates their susceptibility to tuberculosis. Economic, social, and legal barriers increase the likelihood that tuberculosis will spread along the way and block access to care for those who contract it. These barriers, in turn, can lead to increases in the prevalence of tuberculosis in countries of asylum. Lebanon has been a country of asylum for Syrian refugees from the start of the conflict in 2011.313 In the first year of receiving Syrian refugees, Lebanon saw a 27% increase in tuberculosis cases.311\nReflecting this dynamic, countries enact national laws and policies regarding migrants and tuberculosis. For instance, some countries will not provide essential medical services to migrants with tuberculosis, some have legal requirements that individuals with tuberculosis undergo treatment as a condition of attaining legal status, and many detain and deport individuals who have or develop tuberculosis, frequently without providing necessary treatment.310 In the USA, active tuberculosis is still one of the communicable diseases that trigger inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act, though a waiver may be possible.314 These national restrictions based on tuberculosis claim public health as a justification, but directly contravene established public health principles and violate international law.The WHO emphasises that screening of migrants, including refugees, for active or latent tuberculosis \u201cshould always be done with the intention to provide appropriate medical care, and never to exclude or preclude entry\u201d.315 Because tuberculosis is preventable, treatable, and curable, public health principles guide the international community towards identifying and treating every individual with active tuberculosis, regardless of location, immigration status, or socioeconomic status.310 This approach builds on the experience of countries' HIV and AIDS responses and the International Health Regulations, which call for any measure to prevent the spread of an infectious disease to use the least restrictive means possible.316\nWith respect to international law, countries have a right to exercise their sovereignty in imposing immigration restrictions.317 However, international law requires that states only undertake measures that are consistent with human rights and other international obligations. These obligations include non-discrimination on the basis of other status, which includes health status. If states do indeed opt to limit rights, states must show that the limitations are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, that the means achieve the stated aim, and that they are the least restrictive means.318\n",

Secondly, new and emerging health hazards might require new legislative frameworks. Public health laws are often introduced reactively, and then stay on the books for decades. In the face of emerging threats\u2014whether novel pandemics, or new paradigms such as non-communicable diseases\u2014these laws might not be fit for purpose. Conversely, an ambitious goal like achieving UHC calls for forward planning and proactive regulation. The WHO capacity building report also stated that governments might lack the legislative and regulatory tools to discharge their public health and human rights responsibilities effectively. Public health officials need a wide-ranging set of powers to carry out their responsibilities to safeguard the population. At the same time, the law must protect the civil and political rights of individuals, as well as their social, economic, and cultural rights, including non-discrimination and equal protection under the law.

Colleges and universities are uniquely positioned to address this problem, but these institutions alone are insufficient to foster the necessary health law ecosystem. Building the empirical evidence base for effective health laws first requires building disciplinary bridges: mutual understanding, collaboration, common terminologies, and an appreciation of how different skill sets can be applied to public health problems. It also requires genuine interdisciplinary (or even transdisciplinary)16 research, drawing on the expertise of legal scholars, epidemiologists, clinical scientists, policy analysts, behaviour change experts, and anthropologists, amongst others, working together.",

The complex negotiations over the FCTC, the IHR, or the PIP Framework all provide good examples of the need for skilful health diplomacy.
