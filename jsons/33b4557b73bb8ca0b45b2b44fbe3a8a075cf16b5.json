            "text": "Background: Perfectly formed duplex elements in RNA occur within folding units, often as a part of hairpin motifs which can be reliably predicted by various RNA folding algorithms. Double helices with consecutive Watson-Crick base-pairing may also be formed between distant RNA segments thereby facilitating long-range interactions of long-chain RNA that may be biologically functional. Here we addressed the potential formation of RNA duplex motifs by long-range RNA-RNA interactions of distantly located matching sequence elements of a single long-chain RNA. Results: We generated a Python-based software tool that identifies consecutive RNA duplex elements at any given length and nucleotide content formed by distant sequences. The software tool, dubbed RNAslider, is built on the theoretical RNA structure prediction algorithm Mfold. Source code and sample data sets are available on demand. We found that a small ratio of human genes including the Argonaute (Ago)-like gene family encode mRNAs containing highly GC-rich non-hairpin duplex elements (GC-helix) of equal to or more than 8 base pairs in length and we provide experimental evidence for their biological significance.",

            "text": "Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and viral functions, i.e. regulation on the level of genespecific RNAs usually involve structural and functional domains of cellular mRNAs or viral transcripts. For example, the TAR element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a sequence stretch of approximately 60 nucleotides within the 5 0 -region of genomic HIV-1 RNA as well as the 5 0 -portion of viral mRNAs, adopts a thermodynamically stable stem/loop structure that is functionally involved in the regulation of elongation of transcription [1] . Further, internal ribosomal entry sites, mostly found in viral sequences, form defined structural elements that are necessary for translation of protein-coding transcripts (for review see. [2, 3] . On the level of cellular genes, an extra-stable local folding unit of the 5 0 -untranslated region of the murine p53 mRNA seems to be involved in post-transcriptional control of its level of protein translation [4] . In summary, structural and functional RNA modules, often located upstream of the translational initiation site or overlapping with it, are known to be involved in the regulation of protein biosynthesis. Such regulatory local RNA folding units may interact with modulators such as complementary RNA sequences in case of microRNA or antisense RNA-mediated control of gene expression (for review see: [5] ), RNA-binding proteins (for review see: [6] ), or low-molecular metabolites like in case of ribo-switches [7] . In most cases regulatory RNA units are composed of consecutively neighbouring sequence segments and only in rare cases long-range interactions seem to be involved in the formation of regulatory local structures like in IRES elements (e.g. [8, 9] ) or certain classes of catalytic RNA (e.g. [10] ). Particularly simple regulatory modules of limited length such as the TAR element, the RRE element, or packaging signals of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) often adopt structural domains that coincide with local minimal energy states [11, 12] . Studies on the biological role of Argonaute (Ago) genes in human cells indicate a potential post-transcriptional control step involved in regulating endogenous levels of the family member Ago2 [13] . Further, preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory indicate specific binding of RNA sequences surrounding the AUG start codon of the Ago2 mRNA with proteins involved in RNA interference (Sczakiel, unpublished data). This attracted us to study the 5 0 -UTR of mRNA Ago2 with regard to potential RNA cis-elements. Initial computational RNA folding studies indicated the existence of two helices formed by consecutive GC base pairs within the 5 0 -UTR and upstream coding sequences which seemed to represent a rare case. Here we studied whether the occurrence of GC-rich helices could be biologically relevant. Systematic computational and phylogenetic studies as well as experimental evidence in a mammalian cell system support the view that GC-rich duplex motifs formed by distant RNA segments, unlike typical hairpin elements, could bear biological functions.",

Hence we first defined two prerequisites, a minimal distance of 40 nt between two helix strands and a minimal number of 16 bp within this intersegment region to differentiate helices from hairpin elements as it requires RNA structure at a position where a loop is found in hairpin elements. First screens indicated that these conditions result in a very small number of predicted long-range duplexes at a duplex length of greater than or equal to 8 bp. It should be noted that the software tool created in this study also accepts any other kind of duplex settings including (i) the base composition, (ii) different characteristics of the inter-segment sequence which may be longer, shorter or adopt other structures, (iii) and the number of consecutive base pairs included in the duplex of interest.

The software tool described and applied here is written in Python version 2.6.1 and, additionally, integrates the pyExcelerator library (http://pyexcelerator.sourceforge.net). The source code and a sample data set are available for academic users on request. In this study, Mfold version 2.3 was used for mRNA secondary structure prediction, additionally we used Mfold 3.4 (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu) and Sfold 2.2 (http://sfold.wadsworth.org) [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, generally most other RNA secondary structure prediction software can be used with our tool as well. Mfold 2.3 was chosen because we found the best match for the structure-function relationship of antisense oligonucleotides (asON) and siRNA, respectively by Mfold version 2.3 versus a number of six alternative folding software tools [18] . When considering that mRNAs (polII transcripts) usually serve as target RNA for asON and siRNA one might conclude that this Mfold version predicts local structures of mRNA in a reliable fashion [19] .",

Predicted local structural elements that occur at high frequency in a large number of folded relevant windows, regardless of neighbouring sequences, turn out to have a greater chance of being meaningfully related to the biology of corresponding RNA elements. This approach of analysing RNA secondary computationally turned out to produce clearly more reliable results compared with a single fold of the complete long-chain RNA sequence of interest.

We studied the occurrence of non-hairpin duplex elements including GC-rich or AU-rich helices in a library of human mRNA sequences by using this software tool. We consider the library of human RNA sequences as representative because they were chosen randomly and include mRNA from transcription factors, metabolic regulators, receptors, enzymes, ion channels, carrier proteins, glycolproteins, structural proteins, heat shock proteins as well as yet uncharacterised cDNA sequences. Firstly, we retrieved sequences matching the above criteria (Additional file 1: Table S2A ) and performed secondary structure predictions as described in Methods (2.3) using a window size of 800 nt and a step width of 20 nt. Finally, the results were screened for duplex elements, i.e. helices according to the definitions described in 2.1. Human mRNAs vary in total length which is also true for their domains, i.e. the 5 0 -UTR, CDS, and 3 0 -UTR. To account for these variations in length, we describe the helix frequency per 100 nt. When non-hairpin duplexes composed of 8 or more consecutive base pairs were considered, a frequency of 1.774 duplexes per 100 nt was found in the examined mRNA population. In 21 of the evaluated structures (32%) one or more GC-helices were found. The overall GC-helix frequency was 0.01 helices / 100 nt. In comparison, AU-helices occur at about the same frequency and were found in 23 of the scanned structures (35%). In summary, the sequences analysed in this study showed an average length of non-hairpin double helices of 9 \u00b11.5 bp (S.D).",

The nucleotide composition of these domains of the human mRNA sequences studied here is summarised in Figure 1C . Systematic computational analyses of the human mRNA sequences and their predicted structures show that GChelices predominantly occur within the 5 0 -region of mRNAs (0.084 per 100 nt versus 0.006 in the rCDS and 0.002 in the 3 0 -UTR, respectively) while AU-helix frequency is much lower and AU-helices predominantly occur within the 3 0 -UTR ( Figure 1D and E). The distribution of predicted duplex elements within mRNAs can be found in Additional file 2 and a detailed listing of all predicted GC-helices in relation to the start codon is provided in Additional file 3. In contrast, the occurrence of duplex elements with mixed base compositions seems to be more balanced between the three regions (1.738, 1.915 and 1.565 per 100 nt for 5 0 -region, rCDS, and 3 0 -UTR, respectively; Figure 1F ). Replacing the 5 0 -region by 5 0 -UTR and hence rCDS by CDS (i.e. the complete coding region) does not alter these figures substantially. Likewise, the distribution of GC-rich helices is similar to that of classical GC-rich stem loops (data not shown). The uneven distribution of GC-and AU-helices between the three defined regions might be related to a certain extent to the base composition of these regions ( Figure 1C ) but it seems to be unlikely that this fully explains the sharp differences of their local occurrence. To test this, we searched for GC-and AU-duplex motifs in randomly shuffled RNA sequences. Here, GC-duplex frequencies are lower than found in the mRNA population and their location within the three sequence domains is balanced in the pool of shuffled mRNA. The preferred occurrence of GC duplexes in the 5 0 -region of mRNAs was not be observed in case of shuffled mRNAs (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). Also AU-duplexes occur in a balanced fashion within the three sequence domains in contrast to the mRNA sequences, where AU-duplexes are preferably located in the 3 0 -UTR. It should be mentioned that the position of GC-rich helices does not coincide with CpG islands on the level of chromosomal DNA. In the following we focused on double helices predominantly or exclusively composed of GC base pairs.",

Out of 49 orthologous Argonaute sequences, 10 were GC-helix positive. The ten hits share two criteria: they are of vertebrate origin and their gene class is AGO-like Argonautes: Bos taurus Ago1 and Ago2 (two variants), Mus musculus Ago2 (two variants) and Ago4, Rattus norvegicus Ago4, Pan troglodytes two Ago-like (Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly), as well as, Gallus gallus Ago4. As there exist only few complete non-human Argonaute mRNA sequence files, we additionally evaluated 13 predicted sequences. However, since they were not determined experimentally, but are estimated from homologue sequences by GNOMON (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/gnomon.shtml), we separated these results from the rest.

The local energy minimum related to the folding unit between positions 20 and 80 (minimum at position 20 at a window size of 60 nt; (Figure 2A ) coincides with the 9 bp GC-helix depicted in Figure 2B . In order to test whether this GC-helix could be involved in regulation of Ago2 gene expression in functional terms we studied the role of this element in gene expression studies in cell culture as well as its characteristics in protein binding studies in vitro. Firstly, we cloned recombinant plasmids containing the Renilla luciferase open reading frame fused downstream to the 5 0 -UTR of mRNA Ago2 termed pRL-Ago2 ( Figure 2C and Additional file 1: Table S3 ). For control purposes we used the parental luciferase-harbouring plasmid (pRL) or a variant of pRL-Ago2 in which the GC-helices were destroyed by nucleotide exchanges (pRL-Ago2mut, Additional file 1: Table S3 ). In order to study possible effects of over-expression of Ago2 on the 5 0 -UTR Ago2 -luciferase fusion mRNA we co-transfected either of these plasmids together with an established recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid for Ago2 (pNHA-Ago2; [27] ) into human ECV304 cells. The results shown in Figure 2D indicate an up-regulation of the 5 0 -UTR Ago2luciferase fusion by over-expressed Ago2 protein but not in the presence of the parental Ago2-negative plasmid termed 'contr'. Further, basal expression levels of the 5 0 -UTR Ago2 -luciferase fusion seem to be higher than the levels of controls ( Figure 2D , open bars) which is consistent, to a certain extent, with the assumption that endogenous Ago2 increases its expression via the 5 0 -UTR Ago2 .",
