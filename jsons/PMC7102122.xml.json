It can be associated with poor quality of life, reduced longevity and increased mortality. In addition, diabetic neuropathy is the major cause of non-traumatic amputation (Figueroa-Romero et al. 2008). Hyperglycemia, which is known to be a hallmark of diabetes, initiates neuronal tissue damage processes by activating polyol, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), hexosamine and diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways resulting in aconsequent overproduction of ROS (Brownlee 2005).",

They have demonstrated several pleiotropic effects which include restoring endothelial dysfunction, inhibiting proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, reducing platelet aggregation, and increasing stability of atherosclerotic plaques among many others (Istvan and Deisenhofer 2001; Rikitake and K-i 2009). Their neuroprotective effects have also been shown in many studies to be due to their modulation in isoprenylation and myelination processes, immune response, reduction in inflammatory and oxidative responses and increased expression of glutamatergic transporters (B\u00f6sel et al. 2005; Butterfield et al. 2011; Cui et al. 2010; D\u00e9ry et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2010; Zacco et al. 2003). Furthermore, several previous reports have attributed the beneficial effects of Statins to reduction of oxidative stress and correcting the impaired function of nitric oxide in nerves and vasculature (Ii et al. 2005; Matsuki et al. 2010; Nangle et al. 2003). It has been recognized that Atorvastatin attenuates high glucose-induced superoxide formation that is mediated by NOX in coronary arteries (Christ et al. 2002). However it is not clear whether the neuroprotective effect of Statins is mediated by NOX inhibition.",

We hypothesize that NOXs may have a major role in activating the pathways that lead to neural cell injury by increasing the glucose level. In addition the effect of NOXs on cell injury may be sub-type dependent. On the other hand, Atorvastatin and its proven anti-oxidative effects may modulate NOX activity and thus indirectly protect the neural cells from high glucose-induced cell injury. Therefore, this hypothesis was examined by cellular and molecular methods in vitro.",

ROS generation by enhancing glycolytic process could be considered as a major factor in progressive nerve damage (Greene et al. 1999; Pop-Busui et al. 2006). NOXs, as the major contributors of ROS formation, mediate the transfer of electrons across plasma membranes to oxygen and generate superoxide and other downstream ROS (Kakehi and Yabe-Nishimura 2008; Lambeth 2007; Vincent et al. 2004). High glucose has previously shown to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells (Sharifi et al. 2009; Sharifi et al. 2007). Excessive NOX activity is an important factor which causes apoptotic cell death and contributes to a large number of pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration (Abramov et al. 2004; Abramov and Duchen 2005; Meischl et al. 2006; Ryter et al. 2007).",
