The occurrence of post-transplant pneumonia adversely impacts both graft and recipient survival, as well as the cost of care for SOT recipients. 1 Numerous micro-organisms can cause pneumonia in the SOT recipient with some etiologies resulting in self-limited infection and others causing significant morbidity and mortality. As a result of the varied clinical presentations and etiologies of pneumonia in SOT recipients, arriving at a specific microbiologic diagnosis can be challenging but is important for optimal care, especially with complicated or refractory pneumonias. In this section, the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, diagnostic testing, and empiric antimicrobial treatment of pneumonia in SOT recipients are reviewed. Pathogen-specific sections within the AST ID Guidelines are referenced for further information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of specific pathogens that cause pneumonia in this vulnerable population.",

Clinical presentations and differential diagnosis for pneumonia in the solid organ transplant recipient are reviewed. A two-tier approach is proposed based on the net state of immunosuppression and the severity of presentation. With a lower risk of opportunistic, hospital-acquired, or exposure-specific pathogens and a non-severe presentation, empirical therapy may be initiated under close clinical observation. In all other patients, or those not responding to the initial therapy, a more aggressive diagnostic approach including sampling of tissue for microbiological and pathological testing is warranted. Given the broad range of potential pathogens, a microbiological diagnosis is often key for optimal care. Given the limited literature comparatively evaluating diagnostic approaches to pneumonia in the solid organ transplant recipient, much of the proposed diagnostic algorithm reflects clinical experience rather than evidencebased data. It should serve as a template which may be modified according to local needs. The same holds true for the suggested empiric therapies, which need to be adapted to the local resistance patterns. Further study is needed to comparatively evaluate diagnostic and empiric treatment strategies in SOT recipients.",

An understanding of infectious etiologies in these patients is driven by epidemiologic investigation of both transplanted [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and otherwise healthy adult and pediatric patients. 13, 14 In earlier eras, studies of pneumonia in SOT recipients were focused on the high incidence of opportunistic infections such as invasive mold infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV). 12 With improved infection prevention strategies, better diagnostic tools, and newer immunosuppressive strategies, the importance of community-acquired bacterial and viral infection in SOT-associated pneumonia has been increasingly appreciated. 2 The differential diagnosis of pneumonia in SOT recipients depends upon a multitude of non-specific factors including but not limited to age and timing post-transplant, net state of immunosuppression, specific organ transplanted, environmental exposures, site of pneumonia acquisition (community vs. healthcare/hospital-acquired), and radiographic infiltrate pattern. The risk of pneumonia in SOT recipients is determined by the degree/depth of immunosuppression. 15 Healthcare and/or ventilator-associated pneumonia are frequently diagnosed in the early post-transplant period. In two series, early onset pneumonia post-liver transplant was dominated by bacterial etiologies, the majority of which were Gram-negative bacilli. 7, 8 The majority of pneumonia episodes occur later post-transplant with 50% occurring >1 year post-transplant 9 in renal recipients and 70.4% of episodes occurring at >6 months post-transplant in a multicenter point prevalence study. 2 The type of organ transplanted influences the incidence, timing, and microbiologic spectrum of pneumonia in SOT recipients. 16 Lung transplantation poses unique challenges given the potential for donor-derived infection and recipient airway colonization to impact the occurrence and microbiology of pneumonia. In a prospective, multicenter study of pneumonia in lung transplant recipients, pneumonia incidence was 72 episodes per 100 lung transplants per year. 3 Though bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent etiology, fungal ",

Diagnostic strategies must consider numerous factors including post-transplant timing, degree of immunosuppression, environmental/community/hospital exposures, and seasonal epidemiology. Empiric treatment is in large part determined by local epidemiology and resistance patterns. Novel diagnostic techniques and future prospective studies will continue to impact the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in SOT recipients.",

However, data are limited in SOT recipients and the specific clinical in scenarios in which to apply procalcitonin testing are not clear. With pneumonia established by imaging and selected laboratory evaluation underway, empiric therapy as discussed below should be started (see Empiric Initiation Treatment section). Clinicians should progress to the second tier of evaluation (Figure 1) if, despite empiric therapy, the clinical situation does not improve in the first 24 to 48 hours or deteriorates and no diagnosis was made following the first tier of diagnostic evaluation (Figure 1). Second tier testing should be performed with focus on each of four areas-repeating of selected tests from the first tier as appropriate; imaging studies to further define the location and nature of pulmonary involvement; expanded diagnostic evaluation as guided by exposures, radiographic results, and clinical course; and invasive testing with the goal of securing a microbiologic diagnosis for targeted treatment (Figure 1).",

The degree of immunosuppression and pace of illness onset (acute, subacute, chronic) are significant determinants in the breadth of empiric antimicrobial therapy provided to an individual patient. Except during influenza season, where empiric therapy may include an agent directed against influenza, antibacterial therapy is the cornerstone of the initial empiric therapy for pneumonia in the SOT recipient. 108 Empiric antifungal chemotherapy is rarely initiated early, except in instances where the clinical and radiological presentation strongly suggests a fungal origin. The choice of the initial therapy will depend on the following considerations: \u2022 Empiric treatment regimens for pneumonia in the SOT recipient should take into account each individual patient's known microbial colonization as well as prior antimicrobial resistance patterns of specific colonizing or pathogenic organisms with special emphasis on multi-drug resistant bacteria colonizing the airway in lung transplant recipients (strong, low). \u2022 During influenza season, empiric administration of an antiviral drug active against influenza is recommended in SOT recipients with influenza-like illness, including pneumonia, while awaiting results of influenza-specific testing unless there is access to PCRbased detection methods with rapid turnaround time (strong, moderate) 54,83 (See RNA Respiratory Viruses section of 4th edition of AST ID Guidelines).",
