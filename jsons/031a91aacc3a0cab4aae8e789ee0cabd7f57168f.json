Moreover, they found that compared with patients who did not require ICU admission, those requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, suggesting that the cytokine storm might affect the disease severity [2] . We noticed that the plasma IL-6 level was increased dramatically in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cardiac injury. Moreover, death was associated with the cardiac damage induced by fulminant myocarditis (FM). Considering that a cytokine storm is also the core pathophysiological mechanism in FM-which is often fatal, especially in patients with severe multiple organ dysfunction-SARS-CoV-2-associated FM should be given more attention.",

The current Chinese publication on \"Life support-based comprehensive treatment regimen\" demonstrated a mortality rate of less than 5% [22] . This treatment regimen included the early application of sufficient doses of immune-modulation drugs, e.g., sufficient doses of steroids and i.v. immunoglobins, neuraminidase inhibitors, and active mechanical lifesupport treatments. The life-support treatments comprised the application of mechanical respirators and circulatory support systems, of which intra-aortic balloon pulsation (IABP) or Impella implantation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as well as cardiac pacemaker are part of the current therapeutic armamentarium [23] . The important and life-saving role of IABP, Impella, and ECMO has been underlined also by European and American centers [24] [25] [26] . These measures follow the hemodynamic principle of unloading the inflamed myocardium [27] .",
