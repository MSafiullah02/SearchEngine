Here we show the results of the characterization of the five best compounds from this screen. The data presented include the determination of the binding mechanism, the thermodynamic dissection of the process and the selectivity against a panel of other proteases. Our results indicate that a 1000-fold improvement in affinity towards 3CL pro can be achieved by modifying the halogenation of this warhead and the substitution at the P1 position, and by reducing the compound size. Of particular interest is Compound 4, which inhibits the protease by forming an initial reversible complex followed by a much slower irreversible reaction between Cys 145 and the adjacent halomethyl resulting in a thioether linkage. The crystallographic structure of 3CL pro in complex with Compound 4, indicates novel Pn-S n interactions.

The naphthalene substitution at the P1 position of Compound 2 reduced the potency to a K i of 371 \u20ac 15 nM. The addition of fluorine at the para position of the phenyl ring at P1 did not change the potency of Compound 3 (K i = 380 \u20ac 31 nM). Although Gln is traditionally present at this position, a hydrophobic moiety is also highly tolerated. This tolerance is consistent with previous studies where the modifications to the P1 position included a lactam ring in the S stereochemistry (19) , keto-glutamine analogs with a phenyl group at P1 (39) and a,b unsaturated ester (40) ; all of which showed a stark improvement in the inhibitory potency of the compounds to the protease.
