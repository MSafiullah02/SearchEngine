A recent cryo-EM structure of a native full-length trimer without any stabilizing mutations had the same core structure, but revealed new insights and features. A more comprehensive and higher resolution understanding of the glycan shield has also emerged, enabling a more complete representation of the Env glycoprotein structure. Complexes of Env trimers with broadly neutralizing antibodies have surprisingly illustrated that most of the Env surface can be targeted in natural infection and that the neutralizing epitopes are almost all composed of both peptide and glycan components. These structures have also provided further evidence of the inherent plasticity of Env and how antibodies can exploit this flexibility by perturbing or even stabilizing the trimer to facilitate neutralization. These breakthroughs have stimulated further design and stabilization of Env trimers as well as other platforms to generate trimers that now span multiple subtypes. These Env trimers when used as immunogens, have led to the first vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies for structural and functional analyses.",

Even for influenza hemagglutinin, a robust recombinant expression system that could provide sufficient quantities for structural studies was not developed until 2004. 8 Despite the best efforts from the community worldwide, it was not until the development of stabilized Env trimers by John Moore, James Binley and Rogier Sanders that a promising solution was found for HIV-1 Env. Engineering of a disulfide (SOS) between gp120 and gp41 to covalently hold the subunits together 9, 10 and an isoleucine to proline mutation in the HR1 region of gp41 to aid in trimer formation led to a stabilized trimer called SOSIP 11 that finally enabled a soluble, cleaved Env trimer to be assembled and expressed (reviewed in this issue by Sanders and Moore). 12 But it took another 11 years to find a candidate Env with optimal solubility, stability, as well as sufficient expression levels, for high-resolution structures to be undertaken by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 13 and by X-ray crystallography. 14 Other viral glycoproteins have proved equally challenging and production of recombinant and engineered proteins were also essential to determine their three-dimensional structures. Some examples include the F glycoprotein parainfluenza virus 5, 15 glycoprotein G from vesicular stomatitis virus, 16 the fusion protein from respiratory syncytial virus, 17, 18 the Ebola virus glycoprotein, [19] [20] [21] an E2 core protein from hepatitis C virus, 22, 23 the human coronavirus spike glycoprotein, 24 the prefusion glycoprotein of LCMV, 25 full-length herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein B, 26 the Phleboviral envelope glycoprotein, 27 the Puumala virus Gn glycoprotein, 28 and hemagglutinin-esterases from rat coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus. 29 Many of these are very recent structures that illustrate the significant advances that have been made in structure determination of viral glycoproteins.",

[37] [38] [39] Low resolution snapshots of the Env trimer of the surface of both SIV and HIV 37 generated controversy over the exact nature of the trimer configuration and whether the base resembled a tripod 38 or a trimeric helical bundle, 39 a question that still remains unanswered.

            "text": "and Fab 17b (a CD4i antibody) were bound to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs). 40 The flexible nature of the trimers thus became apparent from this early cryo-ET work and further studies by cryo-EM revealed multiple conformations of the Env trimer that were related to the conformational rearrangements that the trimer must undergo to attain its fusion-active form after receptor binding 41 as well as a structure of the prefusion form. 42 Importantly, some antibodies were shown to stabilize the prefusion, closed form of the trimer. 41 For soluble forms of the trimer, structure determination proceeded slowly despite the advent of the SOSIP trimer. In our own lab, we tried to crystallize the original clade B JR-FL SOSIP trimer in collaboration with John Moore and Rogier Sanders starting in 2002. It was not until much later that we found out why that did not work (see below). A change of the Env sequence to a clade A KNH1144 strain in complex with Fab 17b led to Rob Pejchal in the Wilson lab obtaining beautiful crystals with excellent morphology that indeed diffracted x-rays, but only to 17 \u00c5 resolution. It became clear that aggregation of the trimer was a problem with this construct and, after considerable experimentation, truncation of the hydrophobic MPER at residue 664 instead of at residue 681 in the original construct substantially improved the biophysical properties and eliminated the micelle around the gp41 base as clearly visualized by negative-stain EM. 43, 44 The resulting crystals from this material now diffracted to 7.7 \u00c5 in complex with a different Fab, PGT123, which interacts with the high mannose patch centered around glycan N332. To further improve Env properties, SOSIP constructs were made for many different strains. Electron microscopy led to a critical advance here as, of all the constructs screened, a clade A BG505 SOSIP trimer looked the best in negative-stain EM in terms of trimers that were compact, properly folded, and emulated trimers on the surface of the virus. 45 Thus, this BG505 trimer was selected for further immunological and structural studies and was found to be very stable with a melting temperature (Tm) of 68.1\u00b0C, bound all known broadly neutralizing antibodies (except MPER Abs as MPER was not present in the construct), and was highly homogeneous and folded into a native-like structure as evaluated quantitatively by negativestain EM. 46 The importance of cleavage between gp120 and gp41 for attaining a native conformation was also demonstrated to be critical. 47 This soluble, cleaved BG505 SOSIP trimer then became the template for achieving the long-awaited Env trimer structure. Broadly neutralizing antibodies were also to play a crucial role in the structure determination, both by X-ray crystallography and by cryo-electron microscopy. Until 2008, only a handful of bnAbs were available to facilitate crystallization of the highly glycosylated trimer, but significant advances in methods for isolating human monoclonal antibodies against HIV [reviewed (48) ] either by direct neutralization screening of single B cell cultures 49, 50 or from antigen-specific B cell sorting 51, 52 provided a rich and plentiful assortment for structural and functional studies. Indeed, the recombinant BG505 SOSIP trimer itself was later used to select for some of the most potent antibodies to date against the Env trimer. 53, 54 As a result, many antibodies became available to aid in crystallization of the Env trimer. However, heterogeneity of the glycosylation on Env was still a problem until partial deglycosylation of the antibody-SOSIP trimer complexes using EndoH was able to create more homogeneous specimens, 14 as we used previously for Fab PGT135/gp120 complexes. 55 Diffraction-quality crystals were then obtained by Jean-Philippe Julien in the Wilson lab after making a myriad of complexes of the BG505 SOSIP Env with 50 different Fabs, deglycosylating, then setting up over 100 000 crystallization trials, and screening >1000 crystals to find a crystal that diffracted sufficiently well to determine the Env structure. Thus, after more than 10 years from the first attempts to crystallize the JR-FL SOSIP trimer, suitable crystals were obtained for the BG505 SOSIP trimer.",

The Ward lab had been using EM to select and characterize suitable Env trimers for structural study. 43, 45 However, while these EM studies were initially intended to aid the Env structural work by x-ray, major advances in cryo-EM suggested the possibility of now determining structures from single particles at sub-nanometer resolution. 56 To facilitate the detection and alignment of the Env particles, CD4bs antibody PGV04 was complexed with the soluble BG505 SOSIP trimer and, after considerable effort to overcome sample aggregation and preferred orientations, a cryo-EM structure was determined by Dmitry Lyumkis in the Ward lab at approximately 5.8 \u00c5 resolution. Furthermore, the low resolution EM envelope of BG505 bound to PGT122 was crucial for the molecular replacement solution of the X-ray structure. 14 Thus, EM not only caught up, but in a sense surpassed X-ray to achieve the structure of this challenging glycoprotein as the first views at high resolution came from cryo-EM. Also, as no crystallization was required, all of the native glycans could be left on the Env protein enabling visualization of a more native-like and complete glycan shield in addition to the protein components. The resulting structures of BG505 SOSIP by cryo-EM in complex with PGV04 (CD4bs) 13 and x-ray in complex with PGT122 (high mannose N332 glycan patch) 14 at 5.8 \u00c5 and 4.7 \u00c5 resolution, respectively, provided the first atomic-level views of a soluble Env trimer. These structures disclosed the intimate association of the gp120 and gp41 components, the prefusion helical structure of gp41 with its central triple coiled-coil HR1 helices and the close interaction of the hypervariable V2 and V3 loops around the Env trimer apex (Figures 1   and 2 ). Furthermore, broadly neutralizing epitopes for the CD4 binding site and the high mannose N332 patch were visualized in the context of the trimer, illustrating why it was so difficult to raise bnAbs from individual components of the trimer, such as gp120, because antibodies can approach gp120 in ways that are not permitted in a trimer context (i.e. non-neutralizing antibodies are usually generated using gp120 or malformed trimers as an immunogen 57 ). Both EM and X-ray structures highly complemented each other and laid the foundation for understanding the intrinsic beauty and sheer complexity of the Env trimer structure and then for how to design other versions of soluble trimers from different strains and subtypes. 58",

Closer distances between neighboring glycans splayed them apart, whereas intermediate distances allowed them to be more upright and interact at their tips, much like the canopy of a dense forest. Longer inter-glycan distances did not permit such ordered glycan-glycan interactions and, hence, fewer sugar moieties were observed at such sites. Such an extensive and ordered network of interactions appeared to fly in the face of carbohydrate modeling on the Env surface, where they were previously observed to rapidly flicker as if on off hot coals. 35, 68 Prior to the structures mentioned above, cryo-EM was also again used to visualize the glycan shield-this time with all native glycans that include complex, hybrid and high mannose glycoforms 69, 70 -at atomic resolution. One of these, an almost full-length native structure was determined by Jeong Hyun Lee in the Ward lab using cryo-EM with no stabilizing mutations (Figure 3 )-the membrane proximal external region (MPER) and membrane-spanning region were intact, and only the cytoplasmic tail was deleted from the construct. 69 Extensive complex tri-and tetra-antennary sugars were seen in gp41, particularly those that interacted with the PGT151 bnAb that was used to extract and stabilize the trimer from membranes, but not the extensive glycan canopy in gp120 seen in the x-ray structures.",

In the EM structure, the glycans are much more diverse and heterogeneous and would lead to fewer glycans being visualized as multiple glycoforms are present at many positions, especially those that mainly consist of complex and hybrid glycans. 71 But, for the high mannose patch on gp120, which should be relatively homogeneous in both, 71-73 fewer sugars and glycan interactions were seen in the EM structure. Natural glycan processing may to some extent account for this as it depends on the entire constellation of glycans surrounding each and every glycan-even the high mannose patch has complex or hybrid sugars interspersed between and surrounding the high mannose clusters that may make them more heterogeneous in the native versus high mannose glycoproteins. Completely homogenous high mannose sugars may also have a greater tendency to cluster and form defined interactions, but that has still to be verified. The x-ray structures were also complexed with antibodies that interact with and help order glycans as noted in previous x-ray 14, 59, 63 and EM 13 studies. In the x-ray structures, 67 two antibodies are bound to gp120 and one to gp41, whereas in the cryo-EM structure, 69 only one antibody PGT151 is bound asymmetrically (and only two per trimer) at the gp120/gp41 interface. Thus, nine antibodies are bound per trimer in the x-ray structure and only two per trimer in the EM structure. Notably, the most ordered glycans in gp120 in the x-ray structure, as well as the complex glycans in gp41 in the cryo-EM structure, are proximal to where the antibodies are bound. A further x-ray structure of BG505 SOSIP with three 8ANC195 G52K5 Fabs bound per trimer also showed highly ordered high mannose glycans surrounding the bound antibody. 62 Thus, it is now well-appreciated that, when antibodies bind to their glycopeptide epitopes, they can help order the glycans that are part of or proximal to the epitopes. Finally, it might it possible that crystallization can select out more ordered glycoforms, or the crystallization buffer and low pH may artificially promote glycan-glycan interaction.",

            "text": "Notwithstanding, a great swath of supple sugars, numbering around 1000, covers the HIV Env surface and forms a protective glycocalyx 74 An outstanding question that remained is the exact composition of the glycans or the glycoforms at individual glycosylation sites within the Env trimer ( Figure 4) . In order to construct more complete models of the Env trimer than include the glycan shield, it is essential to know what are the specific glycans or collection of glycans that can be built into the x-ray electron density or the EM reconstructions. It has been known for some time that a high level of glycan homogeneity existed in a region known as the high mannose patch [75] [76] [77] (Figure 4) , due to steric crowding that impeded secondary processing from high mannose sugars to more complex glycoforms by glycosidases. 73, 75 This secondary processing takes place in the golgi after the protein is fully folded and hence reflects either the capability or inability of glycosidases to access their glycan substrates on the Env protein [see figure 4 of (72)]. Thus, the tightly crowded high mannose patch on the outer surface of gp120 is essentially independent of the cell line used for protein expression. 73 In gp41, as the glycan sites are further apart (Figure 4 ), more complex or hybrid glycans predominate and the glycosylation then becomes cell-line dependent due to the differential activities of glycosidases in different cell lines. 73 Another important feature is that cleavage of the trimer is critical in attaining proper native-like glycosylation-uncleaved trimers have more processed glycoforms 73 indicating that structure is not folded into the closed native conformation. 47 Indeed, non-native uncleaved gp120 proteins also contain aberrant disulfide bonds. 78 Thus, a substantial breakthrough was required to quantitate the glycan composition at individual glycosylation sites and that was achieved recently by using mass spectrometry to analyze the glycoforms on the Env trimer. 71 The site-specific glycosylation separated into sites that were essentially all high mannose, those that were complex, and other site where mixtures of glycoform types were present. The high mannose patch extends like a belt around the central region of gp120 on the trimer and the more complex forms are mainly located at the trimer apex and the gp41 base with mixed forms scattered more sparsely throughout ( Figure 4) . Thus, this new glycan information is invaluable for not only constructing the best models of Env glycoproteins but also for design of immunogens that more accurately mimic the viral Env. [79] [80] [81] and indeed have been used effectively as immunogens to elicit autologous tier 2 neutralizing antibody responses in animal models. 82 The Kwong group has similarly used this platform to construct trimers from clades B and G. 67 Thus, the SOSIP trimer platform has now been successfully applied to many different strains and subtypes (Figures 1 and 2) and thus is of general utility for producing soluble Env trimers for structural and vaccines studies.",

We will not discuss here the expression of uncleaved trimers containing foldon and Leu-zipper domains as these trimers do not fold into native-like configurations. 47, 83 We will focus on more recent platforms where native-like Env conformations have been obtained using different designs. Two of these designs modify the cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 ( Figure 3 ). One of these designs, termed native flexibly linked (NFL), replaces the natural cleavage sequence REKR with Gly 4 -Ser linkers between the natural C-terminus of gp120 and N-terminus of gp41, 84 where two such repeats were optimal. This more flexible linker, which also increases the distance between the normal C-terminus of gp120 and N-terminus of gp41, appears to allow the uncleaved trimers on BG505 and JR-FL backbone to achieve native-like configurations in the absence of cleavage by furin. However, the I559P mutation that was necessary for stabilization of SOSIP trimers was also required here. This NFL platform has now been used to express Env proteins for other B and C subtypes by incorporating residues from BG505 that are important for trimer formation [called trimer-derived residues (TD)]. 85 A similar design also experimented with inserting Gly-Ser linkers in place of the cleavage sequence on a BG505 backbone where a linker of 15 residues gave optimal properties. This construct maintained the SOSIP mutations (SOS: A501C-T605C and IP: I559P). 86 Thus, these designs resulted in soluble Env trimers that did not need furin for cleavage to achieve native-like conformations and, hence, could potentially simplify the expression of Env trimers.",

However, viral fusion glycoproteins in general are metastable and undergo complex conformational rearrangements in transitioning from the prefusion form that binds receptor to the postfusion form that is able to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane to transfer the viral genome into the cell for replication. However, it appears that the HIV-1 Env protein is more unstable than its counterpart on influenza virus, where its envelope glycoprotein (hemagglutinin) can be readily cleaved from the virus 2, 6 or expressed as a soluble, highly stable protein. 6 The RSV protein is also quite unstable and readily adopts a postfusion form even on the surface of the virus before cell entry. 15 Recent studies from Walther Mothes and colleagues using singlemolecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have vividly demonstrated that unliganded HIV Env is intrinsically dynamic and that it flickers between three distinct conformation on the viral surface. 89, 90 Binding of bnAbs, as well as the natural receptor CD4, can influence the relative distribution of these conformations. 89 Thus, it is not surprising that the recombinant forms of the Env protein also have similar but dampened dynamic character, as they are inherent to the protein itself and not on the engineering or expression system used.",

The available peptide surface on Env outside of the CD4bs is typically very small and most bnAbs have long CDR H3 loops that can navigate through the glycan shield and contact the underlying protein residues to access an epitope composed of both glycan and peptide residues. Recently, immunization of rabbits with the BG505 SOSIP trimer resulted in a neutralizing antibody response that was directed to a breach in the glycan shield where glycans were not present in BG505 as in some other strains and subtypes. 93 BG505 has three glycans that are absent compared to more glycosylated Env proteins and the antibodies seem to be able to access this \"glycan hole\" more readily. 93 within an individual after infection, and the months to years before bnAbs evolve, perhaps allows the immune system more time to target many other sites in addition to the receptor binding site and fusion domain. Many broadly neutralizing antibodies also target the high mannose patch, which because of the homogeneity in glycans, is more conserved than one might have imagined given normal glycan heterogeneity. Some of the antibodies also appear to be effective in stabilizing prefusion versions of the Env trimer and thereby prevent the conformational changes and rearrangements associated with receptor and co-receptor binding and fusion. 97 ",

A combination of different factors contributed to these recent successes and included the critical development of a stable soluble trimer that was native-like and amenable for high-resolution structural studies. 46 An equally important component for structure determination was the diverse assortment of human broadly neutralizing antibodies that became increasingly available after 2008. [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] The Fabs from these antibodies could be exploited in a combinatorial manner using high-throughput crystallization screens with Env trimers, and robotic systems [e.g. see (98) ] to improve the odds of forming a crystal lattice that minimized contacts with the heterogeneous glycosylation of the Env trimer and could produce crystals that diffract to high resolution. These antibodies were also not only important for crystallization, but also for providing appropriate mass and features for single particle cryo-EM. Furthermore, these antibody complexes have elucidated the structure and features of the broadly neutralizing epitopes in the context of the trimer and accelerated the design of immunogens as vaccine candidates. The soluble Env trimers from the BG505 strain have provided the majority of the structures determined to date, but this SOSIP platform has turned out to be transferable to other strains and subtypes (Figures 1 and 2) . These breakthroughs inspired the design of other platforms that capitalized on the stabilizing mutations that proved critical in the SOSIP constructs ( Figure 3 ). While it became clear that uncleaved trimers did not fold into compact trimers, 47 two groups explored replacing the cleavage site with a linker that would provide more flexibility and enable the uncleaved trimers to adopt a native-like prefusion trimer configuration [84] [85] [86] (Figure 3 ). The original I559P mutation that was essential to stabilize the SOSIP trimers is in a highly flexible loop that zips up into a helical structure in the postfusion form after receptor and co-receptor binding. This proline mutation reduced the propensity for such a conformational change. In another design effort, this loop was assumed to be a major cause of the trimer metastabilitythus, the HR1 N loop was shortened and modified in sequence to prevent such a helical postfusion conformation and, when combined with addition of a flexible linker between gp120 and gp41, led to a platform that produced good yields of soluble trimers for a diverse array of strains and subtypes 88 ( Figure 3) . Thus, within a short span of 2-3 years, new Env trimers were produced on different backbones with different platforms and with increased stability that clearly illustrated that such modifications did not perturb the conserved Env trimer fold and could accommodate the regions of sequence and structural hypervariability (Figures 1 and 2) .",

Notwithstanding, this region is still very flexible in the soluble trimers but is less so in native, almost full-length trimers as discussed below. In practice, this flexible region has also become a target for engineering alternate trimers, also discussed below. Furthermore, these new structures with potential precursors and intermediates of the heavy chain of the highly potentPGT121 lineage have provided valuable information on the evolution of different branches of an antibody lineage and how alternate solutions can arise even starting from a single unmutated common ancestor. 63,644 | HIV-1 GLYCOPROTEIN STRUCTURES-THE GLYCAN SHIELDThe glycan shield on HIV-1 has long been thought to act as an impenetrable barrier to the immune system. The 80-90 glycans that cover the surface of the HIV-1 Envelope protein (Env) are put on and processed by our own cells in the journey of the Env glycoprotein from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi to the cell surface and then into the virion itself. These self-glycans should protect the virus against an immune response through tolerance mechanisms, but the virus has gone overboard in almost completely covering the Env surface making it unlike any glycoprotein on the surface of our own cells or even on most other viral glycoproteins(Figure 4",

To circumvent some of the heterogeneity in the glycans for structural studies, the Env proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293S GnTI \u2212/\u2212 cells that produce high mannose glycans and no complex sugars. The glycans were then trimmed with the endoglycosidase EndoH-glycans that are protected within the three-dimensional structure or are proximal to the bound bnAbs are not cleaved by EndoH and can often be more readily visualized. The first X-ray trimer structure showed an extensive assortment of glycans covering the surface [seefigure 1of(14)] particularly around the high mannose patch and around the glycopeptide epitopes bound by the bnAbs. Further x-ray structures of BG505 SOSIP with different antibodies have reinforced this view that the ordered glycans are either closely clustered on the surface or interact with bnAbs. Indeed, a glycan at position 262 is particularly well ordered as it is intimately involved with the folding of gp120 and also helps buttress other glycans on the surface of Env.61 However, in the examples above, the glycans in the x-ray structures are much more homogeneous than on native virions due to expression in cell types such as mammalian HEK 293S cells that restrict the glycoforms to high mannose and which then can be partially trimmed by EndoH. One major advantage of electron microscopy is that the sample protein does not have to be crystallized. Hence, heterogeneous glycosylation can be accommodated in EM structure determination.The cryo-EM samples were therefore produced in HEK 293T cells with glycosylation profiles similar to that on the virus itself. Indeed, the first cryo-EM structure of the BG505 SOSIP trimer showed a great variety of glycans on the Env surface [seefigure S4of(13)].It became clear that EM had a major advantage for sample preparation and that the full complement of glycans, high mannose, hybrid and complex, can be present on the specimen for structure determination. Notwithstanding, the crystal lattice contacts of the BG505 SOSIP trimer with PGT122 and 35022 were made almost entirely by the Fabs and, therefore, provided an unexpected opportunity for fully glycosylated Env to potentially be visualized in the electron density maps of crystal structures. The Kwong group further modified the Env trimer complex by engineering in cysteine mutations in the gp120 and in the bound scFv or Fab VRC01 Fab (G459C in gp120 and A60C in the VRC01 heavy chain), that enabled crystallization of fully glycosylated trimers (high mannose) not only of clade A BG505 SOSIP, but also from clade G (X1193.c1 SOSIP.664) and clade B (JR-FLSOSIP.664)67",

Despite this shimmering sugar sheath, antibodies can in time, usually over a period around 2 years or more, evolve to insert between the glycans using rapier-like long CDRs that can attack the more vulnerable conserved regions of the Env protein below. Thus, most of these sites of vulnerability, or epitopes, on the Env trimer are composed of both glycans and amino acids from the Env protein. An increasing number of sites where antibodies can strike have been found, but these antibodies come too late in natural infection.

In fact, soluble BG505 SOSIP retains this plasticity and also only binds one or two antibodies per trimer, despite the stabilizing mutations.91 The fulllength structure also has a less well-resolved trimer apex, consistent with flexibility in V1/V2. The disordered region at the top of the long HR1 central helix (HR1 N ) connecting the fusion peptide region is however much more ordered and largely helical in the wildtype structure, further emphasizing the key role of the I559P mutation in the soluble SOSIP trimer in destabilizing the postfusion conformation by disrupting the helical propensity of this HR1 N region. This structure also contained the MPER, and binding of MPER bnAb 4E10 showed that the MPER was likely extracted from the membrane upon antibody binding resulting in an apparent elevation of the trimer off the membrane surface, further demonstrating the deformable nature of the trimer.",
