A recent commentary appeared in this journal has pointed out that a rapid way to develop new therapies could be the repurposing of Angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (Gurwitz, 2020) , commonly referred to as sartans and previously suggested by Sun, Yang, Sun, and Su (2020) . After a deep analysis and exhaustive illustration of both the rationale behind this tentative approach and related safety concern, Gurwitz suggested that data mining of clinical patient records survived to COVID-19 epidemic might be useful to assess the feasibility of sartans' repurposing as therapeutic treatment to decrease acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and reduce the aggressiveness from severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.",

This outcome was serendipitously reported since Ebola patients received the antimalarial combination artesunate-amodiaquine in lieu of the first-line antimalarial treatment (artemether-lumefantrine), which was incidentally lacking because of supply failure. Thus, the retrospective clinical analysis suggested the possible repurposing of certain antimalarials against Ebola virus (Garbern et al., 2019) . Interestingly, the antimalarial, amodiaquine analog chloroquine has been recently proposed (Gao et al., 2020) and debated (Touret & de Lamballerie, 2020) as an option in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the use of traditional Chinese remedies as a therapeutic approach for combating SARS-CoV has been well publicized (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003) and it was recently proposed for prevention of COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020) . Despite some warring aspects (Editorial, 2019), WHO has recently recognized traditional Chinese medicine in its influential global medical compendium (Cyranoski, 2018) . Recording which plant(s) was(were) used by Chinese survivors in the last few months could thus offer a golden opportunity to identify a possible source of new antiviral lead compounds .",
