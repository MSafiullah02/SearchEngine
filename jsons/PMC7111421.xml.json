And it has been tremendous sprite in pharmaceuticals as the major key ingredients in drugs to treat many diseases such as meningitis, cholera, plague, typhoid, bacterial skin infections, respiratory and nervous system problems etc., as per the Business Wire and A Berkshire Hathaway Company reports. The therapeutics and percentage of sales were presented to address the importance of chlorine chemistry in pharmaceutical drugs as what have been reported by HIS Applied Economics, Canada (Table 1\n). In United States, more than 88% of the pharmaceuticals were depended on chlorine chemistry including the drugs those have been used for the treatment of stomach ulcer, cancer, anemia, high cholesterol, depression, and epilepsy. As per statistics, the benefit from the chlorine chemistry was estimated to $450 billion per year. The net gain of the pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and Canada using chlorine is as high as $640 billion per year from the health care system reported by HIS Applied Economics, Canada [1]. According to the Business Wire and A Berkshire Hathaway Company reports, the estimating chlorine market for the period of 2018\u20132023 is approximately 4.8%. Some of the drugs presented with chemical structures containing chlorine (number of groups are different). One of the studies detailed that, 163 compounds among 233 approved drugs; nearly 73% of them contained single chlorine atom [2]. Of which, 23% of them possessed by two chlorines, 2.6% of them possessed by three chlorine atoms, 1.4% of them possessed by four chlorines, and 2.5% of them possessed by six chlorines in the compounds. Surprisingly, none of the drugs had been approved with five chlorine atoms yet. Also, among them, 98% were monosubstituted (CCl), only four were disubstituted (CCl2), and none of the approved drugs has trisubstituted (CCl3) groups. This interesting research gap suggests that, chlorine will further continue its industry ruler role to provide and benefit consumers of the pharmaceuticals in the future [1]. To improve the quality and advantage of chlorinated chemistry, scientists need to an advance understanding of the chlorine in the view of medicinal chemistry in the future (see Table 2).",

            "text": "The presence of chlorine atom played a pivotal role in a number of natural products such as the antibiotics clindamycin [3], vancomycin [4], chloramphenicol [5], and griseofulvin. Over the course of time it has been found empirically that the introduction of a chlorine atom into one or more specific positions of a biologically active molecule may substantially improve the intrinsic biological activity [6]. The properties of the carbon-chlorine bond (C-Cl) in organochlorines have been analysed by Henschler [4,5]. However, in the low-molecular-weight chemicals investigated in that analysis, the electrophilic reactivity of the carbon centre adjacent to the chlorine atom, which facilitates displacement of chlorine by (bio)nucleophiles, determines the observed biological properties [4,5]. The increase of lipophilicity of the whole molecule by a chlorine substituent leads to a higher partitioning of a chlorinated compound into the lipophilic phase of a cell membrane or lipophilic domains of a protein. This causes a higher local concentration of the compound near a biological target site, but, not necessarily a higher biological activity. The most important effect of a non-reactive chlorine atom in the biological activity of many compounds comes from chlorine as a substituent on an aromatic, heteroaromatic or olefinic moiety.",

This in turn may cause a tighter interaction or a loosening of the contacts to the amino acids close to the chlorine or in other parts of the active molecule. Either one may affect the function of the target protein and cause an increase or decrease of biological activity. In other cases however a chlorine substituent may have no specific effect on the primary biological properties of the molecule to which it is attached [7]. Chlorinated compounds are not necessarily toxic or dangerous. Highly reactive chemicals or polychlorinated compounds cannot be compared with regard to toxicological properties with unreactive compounds having a low degree of chlorination. The chlorine atom, as one of many possible substituents used in synthetic organic chemistry, will remain in the future one of the important tools for probing structure-activity relationships in life science research and as a molecular component in commercialized compounds, in order to provide safer, more selective and more environmentally compatible products with higher activity for medicine and agriculture [7].",

A number of infections caused by resistant organisms not succeed at responding to the conventional treatment and even the last choice antibiotics were also lost their power [12].

In the first step, three different chlorine-substituted pyridinium iodide salts (199) were synthesized in good yields by the heating of corresponding aryl methyl ketones (198) in the presence of iodine and pyridine at 140 \u00b0C for 3 h. In the second step, Al2O3 catalyzed condensation reaction was applied to prepare six aryl benzofuran-3(2H)-ones 202 by condensing benzofuran-3(2H)-one (200) with aryl aldehydes 201 in methylene chloride for 3 h at room temperature.

A mixture of aryl benzofuran-3(2H)-ones 202, pyridinium iodide salts (199) and NH4OAc in glacial acetic acid was heated at 100 \u00b0C for 12\u201324 h to afford compound 203 (\nScheme 15\n) in considerable yields.

The SAR results suggested that, the chlorinated compounds showed better anti-proliferative activity than those of corresponding non-chlorinated compounds. The chlorination at the 2-phenyl ring is important to inhibit the topo I and II activity. These results provided useful information for the development of benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridine derivatives as a novel class of topoisomerase-targeted anticancer agents [41].",

According to the estimated data obtained in 2010, around 285 million peoples were suffered from diabetes all over the world and it may increase to 439 million by 2030 [69,70]. Blood glucose changing due to the insulin resistance is regarded as the feature of being diabetic in 95% of the cases [71] which give raise to several problems like high blood pressure, heart problem, kidney failure, stroke and blindness [72]. Consequently, the inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase (EC. 3.2.1.20), a key carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme, could serve as an effective methodology in both preventing and treating diabetes through controlling the postprandial glucose level and suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia [73]. \u03b1-Glucosidase specifically performs the hydrolysis of \u03b1-glucopyranoside bond, resulting in the production of \u03b1 -d-glucose from the non-reducing end of the sugar [74]. Several \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors like acarbose, voglibose, and miglitol, have appeared in clinic for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus [75], however, number and intensity of side effects call for the development of potent, structurally diverse, safe and efficacious drugs for the effective treatment of diabetes mellitus.",

Deficits of acetylcholine (Ach), inflammation, \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposits, oxidative stress, dyshomeostasis of biometals, tau-protein aggregation are considered to be such pathophysiological factors [[93], [94], [95]].

Compound 362 was evaluated as a novel class of efficacious dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Compound 362 showed good enzyme activity against PI3K and mTOR (IC50 (PI3k\u03b1/mTOR) = 3.4/4.7 nM) and potent suppression of Akt and p70s6k phosphorylation in cellular assays. Furthermore, compound 362 also demonstrated significant in vivo efficacy in a PC-3M tumour xenograft model [125].",

The syntheses of target compounds was lengthy and it includes six chemical steps starting from 2-aminopyrazine 363. Commercially available 2-aminopyrazine 363 was diboration by selective displacement of the bromine in the 3-position with sodium methoxide to obtain 2-amino-5-bromo-3-methoxypyrazine 364. The bromine at 5-position was then removed by hydrogenation and coupling of the 2,3-dichlorophenylsulphonyl chloride with 2-amino-3-methoxypyrazine 365 to yield 366. A highly selective 5-position nitration of 366 followed by reduction of the nitro group 367 gave an amino-pyrazine 368 which was diazotized in the presence of hydrofluoric acid to give 369 in good yield (Scheme 52\n). The synthesized final compound and intermediates were screened for their CCR4 receptor inhibition activity. Compounds 366 (pIC50 7.8) and 369 (pIC50 8.6) were showed good potency against Human CCR4 receptor [126].",
