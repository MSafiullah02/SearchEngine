The profound impact that SARS had upon the people of Hong Kong can still be clearly seen seventeen years later; people habitually wearing protective facemasks, communally touched surfaces in public places being regularly disinfected, antibacterial hand gel dispensers located throughout all shopping centres, and public toilets that are amongst the cleanest in the world. The intent to prevent another SARS-like infection in Hong Kong is clear for all to see; however, that all changed at the end of last year with the emergence of novel coronavirus in Mainland China, Quickly, cases were confirmed in Hong Kong and the fear of another pandemic lead rapidly to a pandemic of fear. People were panic buying, prices were rising, and supermarket shelves were very quickly stripped of essential food items and basic cleansing products. It was impossible to turn on the television without being told about the importance wearing surgical masks, how to wear surgical masks, the surgical masks celebrities were wearing and the danger of wearing \"fake\" surgical masks. Interestingly, limited attention was being given to the effectiveness of wearing a surgical facemask in the face of viral infection. Surgical masks were, and still are, in very short supply and retail prices have increased sharply. One enduring television image of recent weeks has been the sight of older people standing in line overnight in cold weather to get a small package of surgical masks hoping to protect themselves from the virus. Perhaps, all of these activities mask the truly important public health message that good personal hygiene and effective handwashing is the most effective way to curb the spread of the virus. As clinical nurses, we all know that engaging in these actions will outweigh the benefits of wearing any surgical mask.",

The Journal of Clinical Nursing published several significant papers that highlighted the emotional impact of caring at the time of SARS and dealt with some of the other lessons that could be learnt from the outbreak, in terms of evaluating systems of care delivery and use of nursing care models (Watson, 2009) . It was hoped that research generated during this period would help the international nursing community be in a better position to deal more effectively with any subsequent viral outbreaks. With the emergence of COVID-19, that was about to be tested. Would healthcare managers and hospital administrators understand what is really needed to support nursing practice and ensure the provision of high quality of care? Would they deliver this time?",

This editorial sets out to examine some of these issues that are closely associated with the nursing profession. Howard Catton (ICN CEO) commended the courage and compassion that has been shown by Chinese nurses, stressing the importance of them having access to the correct safety equipment and clothing at this time. However, there have been numerous reports of shortages of even the basic personal protective equipment, such as masks and protective suits (ICN, 2020). It has even been reported that in some rural Chinese hospitals, clinical staff have resorted to wearing their raincoats and using plastic bags as a source of protection (Buckley, Wee, & Qin, 2020) . World Health Organization Director-General Mr Tedros hailed healthcare workers as \"the glue that holds the health system and the outbreak response together\" (WHO, 2020) . Indeed, the WHO provides very comprehensive guidelines for the protection of front-line healthcare workers when faced with such an epidemic. The question is how can nurses adhere to such guidance when they are starved of even the most basic personal protective equipment? How adhesive can \"the glue\" be in the face of such adversity?",

Healthcare-associated amplification of transmission of emerging viral infections is always a concern; surely, lessons should have been learnt about the importance of occupational protection during previous epidemics, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012. Clearly, some lessons have not been learnt, as clinical nurses in China who are battling the virus are working around the clock and some are not eating food so as to avoid the need for toilet breaks (Thiagarajan, 2020) . Nursing staff need to change their protective gear if they take a toilet break; therefore, some have resorted to wearing diapers and there are even stories of nurses shaving their heads to reduce spread of infection and to allow them to be able to change their protective gear more quickly (Farber, 2020) . Stories of nursing courage and compassion are bounteous; however, the narrative of Nurse Yao, captured by the BBC, is one which is particularly touching.

The WHO also provides \"Open WHO,\" which offers free and reliable health-related information to the world. In China, medical advertisers have not missed the opportunity to capitalise on the outbreak of COVID-19, reporting that one traditional Chinese herbal remedy may be effective in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 (Heymann & Shindo, 2020) . This remedy has now sold out across China, despite the fact that there is presently very limited evidence to support the claims; indeed due to the nature of the illness, it may actually produce counterproductive effects. It is also somewhat ironic that the most likely crossover of the virus took place at a wet market, selling the very foods and remedies that are used in traditional health practices to promote immunity and longevity.
