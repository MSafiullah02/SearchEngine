In such a challenging scenario demanding major efforts for the entire health system, measures were also required to address the medical needs of patients with cancer.

Ph1 study facility access excluded vendors, minimal ancillary services, all visitors and medical monitors and auditors. We established triage checkpoint outside the facility, clinic or office, with social distancing of at least six feet apart to screen patients and visitors for COVID-19 symptoms and fever before they enter. We converted any current open infusion suite to semi-private space with at least six feet distance between patients and/or use available curtains as a barrier between patients.

One of the most effective measures aiming to contain the pandemic spread is social isolation, including quarantine of entire areas and travel bans [6] . These norms can pose significant challenges to patients residing far from the study centre, demanding the implementation of flexibility in performing the experimental clinical procedures. Therefore, a set of solutions have been discussed with the sponsors. Overall, optional trial procedures (e.g. biopsies) have been withdrawn. Biochemical and radiological assessments, with the permission of the sponsors, have been performed in the accredited closest facility to the patients. We locally and centrally revised all scans to guarantee the high quality of data. In our experience, scheduled visits at clinical sites have been significantly impacted for patients outside our region. For certain investigational products, such as those distributed for self-administration, we agreed with the sponsors alternative safe delivery methods. For other investigational products normally administered in a healthcare setting (intravenous or subcutaneous treatments), we guaranteed on time administration for all local patients and we delayed, within the window of treatment, for patients with difficulties in accessing the facility. We implemented telemedicine for more intense safety active monitoring of patients [7] .",
