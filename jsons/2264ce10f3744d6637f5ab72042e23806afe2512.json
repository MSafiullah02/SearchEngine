With the advent of r-DNA technology, it is possible to construct vector with immunologically active genes against specific pathogens. Nevertheless, site-specific delivery of constructed genetic material is an important contributory factor for eliciting specific cellular and humoral immune response. Nanotechnology has demonstrated immense potential for the site-specific delivery of biomolecules. Several polymeric and lipidic nanocarriers have been utilized for the delivery of genetic materials. These systems seem to have better compatibility, low toxicity, economical and capable to delivering biomolecules to intracellular site for the better expression of desired antigens. Further, surface engineering of nanocarriers and targeting approaches have an ability to offer better presentation of antigenic material to immunological cells.

Similarly, Robinson proved the ability of DNA plasmids against influenza virus antigens (Fynan et al. 1993) . The capability of plasmids carrying HIV antigens or tumor antigens to generate immune responses and protection from tumor in mice has been described (Wang et al. 1993 ). Importantly, a DNA vaccine affects humoral as well as cellular immunity. The use of the DNA approach also promised to overcome the safety concerns associated with live vaccines-their reversion risks and their potential spread to unintended individuals, avoids the risks linked to the manufacture of killed vaccine (Ruprecht 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 389, "text": "(Ulmer et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 480, "end": 499, "text": "(Fynan et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 651, "end": 668, "text": "(Wang et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 986, "end": 1001, "text": "(Ruprecht 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Vaccines are generally composed of whole organism-either live and weakened or killed forms (first-generation vaccines). Live, attenuated organisms such as smallpox and polio vaccines are able to induce killer T-cell (T C ) responses, helper T-cell (T H ) responses, and antibody immunity (Fig. 1) . First-generation vaccines providing maximum protection but associated with a risk that attenuated forms of a pathogen can revert to a dangerous form and may still be able to cause disease, especially in immune compromised vaccine recipients (e.g., AIDS patients). Killed vaccines cannot generate specific killer T-cell responses and will be effective against limited diseases where cellular response is not essential (Alarcon et al. 1999 ). These were the reasons which initiated the research for second-generation vaccines. Second-generation vaccines were the subunit vaccines, consisting of defined protein antigens (such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoid), recombinant protein components (hepatitis B surface antigen), or surface proteins (influenza). These vaccines are able to generate TH and antibody responses, but not killer T-cell responses. This reason again restricted the utility of these vaccines to limited number of diseases. Today is the era of genetic immunization, which is nextgeneration vaccine (third generation), which seems to be highly effective till date. This strategy is based upon improved gene optimization, improved RNA structural design, novel formulations and immune adjuvants, and more effective delivery approaches (Alarcon et al. 1999; Robinson and Pertmer 2000) . At the cellular level, introduction of nanotechnology and the development of nanocarrier-based vaccines provide effective immunization through better targeting and by triggering antibody responses. In order to induce an effective protective immunity, these vaccines require boosting with agents called adjuvants. Adjuvants and delivery vehicles have shown to protect antigens from degradation.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of potent and safe adjuvants and delivery systems that can be used with new generation of vaccines. As shown in Fig. 3 , there are several ways in which antigen expression and immunogenicity can be improved for the DNA vaccine platform. There are lot of steps undertaken to modify immunogenicity and safety of DNA vaccines (Fig. 3) . Promoter is an important component of the plasmid that drives high levels of expression of the gene of interest. Various promoters have been utilized to improve the expression of vaccine genes. The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter has been extensively used for high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells (Boshart et al. 1985) . However, there are some drawbacks associated with CMV promoters like chromatin condensation by histone deacetylase. Recently, histone deacetylase inhibitors have been supplemented with CMV promoter-based plasmid that has shown increased expression of DNA vaccine antigens (Lai et al. 2010 immediate-early promoter one (ie1) have also demonstrated better gene expression in insect cells compared with CMV promoter (He et al. 2008 ). The porcine circovirus type 1 capsid gene promoter has enhanced the antigen expression and immunogenicity in a HIV-1 plasmid vaccine (Tanzer et al. 2011 ). Regulation of transcriptional termination is a key element in control of gene expression within the framework of a single transcriptional promoter (Barr et al. 2002) . So one of the most effective ways to increase protein production is through the use of codon optimization or by adopting species-specific codon changes (Gustafsson et al. 2004) . Plasmid backbone optimization has also been important contributory factor for DNA vaccine. Replacement of SV40t polyadenylation and splicing signals of the pAEC plasmid vectors by synthetic intron and synthetic rabbit beta globin-based termination/polyadenylation sequences and CpG motif have enhanced the cell-mediated IFN-gamma-secreting activity.

Viruses have evolved specialized molecular mechanisms to efficiently transport their genomes inside the cells they infect. Viral vector vaccines carry DNA into a host cell for production of antigenic proteins that can be tailored to stimulate a range of immune responses, including antibody, T helper cell (CD4 + T cell), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL, CD8 + T cell) mediated immunity (Draper and Heeney 2010) . Retroviruses, parvoviruses, adenoviruses, lentiviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and the herpes simplex virus are being investigated for their ability to transfer DNA. Gene expression with high transfection efficiencies in tissues, such as kidney, heart, muscle, eye, and ovary, has been achieved by using viral vectors.

Co-injection of plasmids encoding cytokines, chemokines, or co-stimulatory molecules like death receptors, growth factors, adhesion molecules, toll-receptor ligands can be used individually or in combination to maximize substantial effect on the immune response in the clinic, in both prophylactic and therapeutic studies to plasmid-encoded antigen. For example, boost the humoral and cellular response when antigen co-administered with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs in mice (Higgins et al. 2007) .

Among various improvement strategies, the incorporation of cytokine-expressing plasmids as molecular adjuvants has been widely studied in the past years, yet still without significant clinical application. This chapter reviews recent progress in the co-application of cytokine-encoding genes used for enhancement and direction of immunogenicity, as well as discusses their therapeutic potential for future applications. Coadministration of pro-inflammatory agents (such as various interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and GM-CSF) plus TH2-inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1-inducing cytokines decrease humoral responses and increase cytotoxic responses (which is more important in viral protection, for example).

Aqueous dispersions of MPL in isotonic buffers when admixed with soluble protein antigens can provide a strong adjuvant effect. An advantage of these MPL plus antigen is that they tend to be well tolerated and induce little or no local tissue reaction at the injection site (Qureshi et al. 1985) .

Advantage of the use of liposomal DNA is that it may be taken up directly by APCs such as dendritic cells, which results in transfection and MHC classes I and II expression, which stimulates the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells by antigenic peptide and induces CTL responses and also B cells to produce antibodies, whereas vaccination with naked plasmid DNA, the plasmid is taken up by the myocytes, which are transfected. Unfortunately, there are a number of problems associated with the use of conventional liposomes as genetic vaccine delivery vehicles. The relatively low transfectivity of liposomes, particularly evident with insufficient quantities of polynucleotide within liposomal formulations, can be overcome by adding positively charged amphipathic lipid moieties to liposomal formulations.

Gregoriadis et al. for the first time showed that intramuscular immunization of mice with pRc/CMV HBS (encoding the S region of hepatitis B antigen; HBsAg) entrapped into positively charged (cationic) liposomes leads to greatly improved humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Gregoriadis et al. 1997 ). These cationic liposome-entrapped DNA vaccines generate titers of anti-HBsAg IgG1 antibody isotype in excess of 100-fold higher and increased levels of both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 when compared with naked DNA or DNA complexed with preformed similar (cationic) liposomes. Further, modification of liposomal surface with polymer offers potential for oral administration of plasmid DNA and able to elicit markedly enhanced transgene-specific cytokine production following in vitro restimulation of splenocytes with recombinant antigen (Somavarapu et al. 2003) . Modification of lipid/DNA complexes by the polymer poly(D,L-lactic acid) was found to be consistently and significantly more effective than either unmodified liposomal DNA or naked DNA in eliciting transgene-specific immune responses to plasmid-encoded antigen when administered by the s.c. route (Bramwell et al. 2002) . Surface-modified mannosylated cationic liposomes were developed for targeted delivery of pDNA to APCs, and the results verified that Man lipoplex induces significantly higher pUb-M gene transfection into dendritic cells and macrophages than unmodified lipoplex and naked DNA and it also strongly induces CTL activity against melanoma, inhibits its growth and prolongs the survival after tumor challenge compared with unmodified liposomes (Lu et al. 2007 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 368, "text": "(Duzgunes et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 585, "end": 606, "text": "(Brigham et al. 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 776, "end": 791, "text": "Liu et al. have", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 880, "end": 896, "text": "(Liu et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1196, "text": "(Gregoriadis et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1748, "text": "(Somavarapu et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2070, "text": "(Bramwell et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2526, "text": "(Lu et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 650, "end": 657, "text": "(Fig. 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Cationic Liposomes"}, {"text": "An anionic lipid formulation called fluid liposomes was capable of delivering fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides into bacterial cells.

The ISCOM (immunostimulating complex) is a complex consisting of protein antigen, cholesterol, phospholipid, and the saponin adjuvant Quil A. A similar vaccine delivery vehicle and adjuvant has also been developed that uses the same material minus the antigen and is referred to as ISCOMATRIX \u00ae . The antigen can be added later to the ISCOMATRIX \u00ae during formulation of the vaccine. This material seems to work similarly to ISCOMs but provides for more general applications by removing the requirement for hydrophobic antigens (Pearse and Drane 2005) .

Adjuvant-active nonionic block copolymers that are flexible, linear structures, flanked on both ends by hydrophilic polyoxyethylene (POE) with a core of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene (POP) with variable ratios (Newman et al. 1998) . The block copolymers are useful as general surfactants and display enhanced biological efficacy as vaccine adjuvants.

Jain et al. evaluated a system of combined poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for the delivery of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

An outer shell form by PEG allows for prolonged release patterns and enhanced mucosal uptake to occur (Jain et al. 2009 ). Hunter et al. (1991) showed that the adjuvant activity of block copolymers varies with the lengths of the chains of polyoxypropylene (POP) and polyoxyethylene (POE).

First discovered in the early 1980s by Donald Tomalia and coworkers, these hyperbranched molecules were called dendrimers. Dendrimers are highly branched, synthetic spherical macromolecules with layered architectures that can be considered analogous to a globular protein. They have the potential for high loading capacities due to small diameters (1.5-14.5 nm) through mechanisms such as complexation or formation of chemical bonds at terminal branch points or other active sites (Wiwattanapatapee et al. 2000) . In addition, the low polydispersity of dendrimers should provide reproducible pharmacokinetic behavior in contrast to that of some polymers containing fractions with vastly different molecular weight within a given sample (Parekh 2007) . Several dendrimer-based products have been approved by the FDA and successfully commercialized for treatment and diagnosis of diseases, Including VivaGel\u2122 (Starpharma) designed as a topical microbicide, SuperFect \u00ae , (Qiagen Pvt Ltd.) used for gene transfection, and Alert Ticket\u2122 (US Army Research Lab) for anthrax detection (Merdan et al. 2002) . In the past decade, research has increased on polyamidoamine, polyethylenimines, polylysine, polypropyleneimine, polyaryl ether, polyester, polyglycerol and their derivatives for the design and synthesis of biocompatible dendrimers. Dendrimers form complexes by electrostatic interaction with all forms of nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides. The nature of the dendrimer-nucleic acid complexes (\"dendriplexes\") is dependent on the stoichiometry and concentration of the DNA-phosphates, dendrimer amines, bulk solvent properties (e.g., pH, salt concentration, buffer strength), and even the dynamics of mixing. High ionic strength interferes with the binding process and affects the nature of complexes formed by the different generations, for example, highergeneration PPI dendrimers in higher concentrations form water-soluble dendriplexes, whereas the G1 and G2 PPI dendrimers lead to the formation of electroneutral complexes (Tang and Szoka 1997) . Dendrimer-DNA complex is formed by simply mixing the components in an aqueous solution. Transfection property can be improved by the use of an excess of cationic dendrimer because the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA neutralize the positively charged amine groups on the dendrimer through electrostatic interaction and an overall positively charged system is important in cell uptake (Bielinska et al. 1999) . Immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA vaccines can be improved by physical conjugation of the PAMAM dendrimer to the MHC class II-targeting peptide. Therefore, dendrimers can be further explored for DNA-based vaccine development against malaria parasite (Pietersz et al. 2006 ). In a recent study, dendriplexes, complexes of dendrons and condensed plasmids containing the gene for protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis, were encapsulated in polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) particles using the double emulsion method. Studies indicated that the PLG-dendriplex particles produced superior levels of anti-PA IgG antibodies when compared to animals immunized with the PLG particles (Ribeiro et al. 2007 ). Conjugation of fifth-generation polyamidoamine (G5-PAMAM) dendrimers, a DNA-loading surface, with MHC class II-targeting peptides that can selectively deliver these dendrimers to APCs under conditions that enhance their immune stimulatory potency. DNA conjugated with this platform efficiently transfected murine and human APCs in vitro. Subcutaneous administration of DNA-peptide-dendrimer complexes in vivo preferentially transfected dendritic cells (DC) in the draining lymph nodes, promoted generation of high affinity T cells, and elicited rejection of established tumors. Taken together, our findings show how PAMAM-dendrimer complexes can be used for high transfection efficiency and effective targeting of APCs in vivo, conferring properties essential to generate effective DNA vaccines. Multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) dendrimer system is being used for vaccine and immunization purposes. MAP-based delivery can prepare by addition of multiple immune-functional components, like B/T-cell epitopes, cell-penetrating peptides, and lipophilic moieties or by controlled synthesis of nanomaterials like micelles, dendrimers, and nanoparticles (Fujita and Taguchi 2011) . A tetravalent multiple antigen peptide (MAP) dendrimer with four identical branches of a C-terminal peptide sequence of the rat GH-BP (GH-BP263-279) was synthesized and used as an immunogen in rabbits. The tetravalent rat GH-BP263-279 MAP dendrimer served as an effective immunogenic antigen in eliciting specific antibodies (Aguilar et al. 2009 ).

Oral delivery refers to absorption from the buccal through the rectal mucosa. Several barriers associated with genetic vaccination through the oral are generally attributed to (a) low permeability across biological membranes, (b) harsh gastric environment, (c) hepatic first-pass metabolism, and (d) chemical instability. The major drawback with oral route of administration is a higher concentration and is required for the vaccine to be effective due to dilution during the transport of the vaccine through the gastrointestinal tract. To date, most gene delivery strategies have concentrated on the parenteral route of delivery and oral administration has been largely ignored. Different nano-and microparticulate delivery systems using natural and synthetic lipid and polymers have been utilized to improve the stability and immunogenicity of oral DNA vaccines (Bhavsar and Amiji 2007) . Oral vaccination with DNA-chitosan nanoparticles has appeared interesting because of their great stability and the ease of target accessibility, besides chitosan immunostimulatory properties. Studies demonstrated that 47 % of protection against parasite infection after delivery chitosan nanoparticles loaded with DNA encoding Rho1-GTPase protein of Schistosoma mansoni (Oliveira et al. 2012) . Similarly, chitosan nanoparticles are used for DNA vaccine against Vibrio anguillarum through oral route.

This route has a number of advantages, such as the high permeability of the nasal epithelium, which allows a higher molecular mass cut-off for permeation of approximately 1,000 Da, as well as the rapid drug absorption rate. Accurate and repeated dispensing of vaccine, mucociliary clearance, presence of peptidases, proteases and nuclease enzymes in the mucus or associated with nasal membrane, variation in extent of absorption with the mucus secretion and mucus turnover and deposition of the formulated vaccine to all areas of the nasal mucosa (especially lymphoid tissues), potential of uptake of vaccine formulations by the primary olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity, local irritation and unpleasant taste from concentrated drug reaching the mouth are major challenges associated with intranasal delivery of vaccines (Oliveira et al. 2007; Sharma et al. 2009 ). These problems can be overcome by design of appropriate antigen carriers. Nanocarriers for nasal vaccines are able to facilitate the transport of the associated antigen across the nasal epithelium, thus leading to efficient antigen presentation to the immune system and provide the protection and stability of encapsulated genetic materials (Koping-Hoggard et al. 2005) . Further, use of mucoadhesive agents offers a strategy for the facilitation of increased residence time and increased vaccine efficacy (Alpar et al. 2005) .

There are several advantages of needle-free noninvasive gene administration such as limited toxicity, potential cell receptor-independent uptake, minimal DNA size restrictions, and the potential for multiple treatments via a relatively uncomplicated administration modality, thus improving patient compliance. Topically applied formulation, especially nanosystems have been shown to enter skin, accumulate in hair follicles, diffuse via dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes, and elicit antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Nasir 2009 ). A number of methods have been developed to perform noninvasive topical gene delivery, which includes passive diffusion of genetic materials between a skin patch and skin, as well as active processes such as iontophoresis, sonophoresis, electroporation, and chemically enhanced diffusion (Mehier-Humbert and Guy 2005). Topical vaccination has been achieved using topical application of naked DNA with or without tape stripping and DNA/lipid-based complex such as liposomes, niosomes, Transfersomes, or microemulsion (Cui and Sloat 2006) . Ethanol-in-fluorocarbonbased microemulsion has been for topically delivery of anthrax protective antigen (PA) protein-encoding DNA vaccine (pGPA). pGPA-loaded microemulsion has significantly enhanced the anti-PA antibody responses (Cui and Sloat 2006) .

Results revealed that DNA-loaded cationic transfersomes elicited significantly higher anti-HBsAg antibody titer and cytokines level as compared to naked DNA. It was also observed that topical application of DNA-loaded cationic transfersomes elicited a comparable serum antibody titer and endogenous cytokines levels as produced after intramuscular recombinant HBsAg administration (Mahor et al. 2007) . 40-or 200-nm sized polystyrene nanoparticles have been studied to target active compounds to the hair follicle and may result in a better penetration and higher efficiency of compound uptake by skin resident cells. Studies demonstrated that 40 and 200 nm NPs and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the green-fluorescent protein penetrated deeply into hair follicles and uptake by APCs and transport to the draining lymph nodes (Mahe et al. 2009 ). Nanoengineered genetic vaccine formulation has been developed for topical immunization comprising of emulsifying wax (oil phase), CTAB (cationic surfactant), Mannan (DC ligand), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (endosomolytic agents), and cholesterol. All pDNA-coated nanoparticles, especially the mannan-coated pDNA-nanoparticles with DOPE, have shown significant immune response (IgG titers; 16-fold over \"naked\" pDNA alone) (Cui and Mumper 2002) . Diffusion patches and tape stripping techniques are used for delivery of small (<500 Da) and large molecules, respectively. Liquid jet injector is an approach in which DNA vaccine is delivered around the Langerhans cells by a high-speed injector. (Chen et al. 2002) reported that particle-mediated gene-gun DNA immunization use similar mechanical devices to deliver DNA vaccines into viable epidermis (Chen et al. 2002) . Microneedle arrays is a set of needles of microscale length with their nanoscale tips coated with DNA and can accurately, efficiently and safely deliver biomolecules to the viable cells of the epidermis. Recently, Tran et al.

Various immunity responses were generated by different adjuvant like MF59 and MPL \u00ae generated Th1 responses, VLPs, virosomes, nondegradable nanoparticles, and liposomes generated cellular immune responses in humans. Viral vectors, ISCOMs and Montanide\u2122 ISA51, 720 and various nanoparticulate immunopotentiators and antigen delivery vehicles have shown CTL responses. The desirable responses can be achieved by using combination of various adjuvants. Systemic antibodies produced in humans when viral-vectored vaccines as well as proteasomes given IN. The clinical trials required for vaccine approval are often very long and difficult. Furthermore, since many vaccines are often administered to healthy individuals, and frequently to infants, it is critical that they are proven safe and well tolerated in nonhuman primates before entering human trials. While the development of novel vaccine delivery systems and adjuvant has been aided by nanotechnology, it must be necessary to perceived potential problems such as their high surface area and reactivity, the ability to cross biological membranes, slow biodegradability of some materials, its safety and tolerability before its approval. Many challenges must be met before new classes of vaccines become available like ability to stimulate humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses, longer duration response, easily metabolized of vaccine components in body, cost-effective production, and lesser risk and less invasive approaches for the administration of vaccinations. As these challenges are met, the prevention and therapy of many previously untreatable diseases should become increasingly possible.

Quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV)[types 6,  11, 16, 18]  recombinant vaccine (Gardasil \u00ae ; Silgard \u00ae ) is composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by self-assembly of recombinant L1 capsid protein from each of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The VLPs are highly immunogenic, inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the particular HPV types when administered to animals or humans (McCormack and Joura 2011). Human papillomavirus (HPV)-based gene transfer vectors (pseudovirions; PsVs) have been used to deliver SIV genes to the vaginal epithelium.
