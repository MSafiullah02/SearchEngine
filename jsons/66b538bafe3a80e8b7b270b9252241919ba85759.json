            "text": "Photosynthesis or use of simple growth media provides clear advantages for using plants to produce biomass and protein products at low cost [1] [2] [3] . The majority of posttranslational modifications important for many complex eukaryotic proteins can be performed by plants, whose species diversity offers variety in production platforms from in vitro cultures through field crops, all within established regulatory guidelines. Of particular benefit is that plants cannot harbor human and animal pathogens that can plague in vitro mammalian production systems, so plants provide major advantages in product safety, especially for therapeutics [4, 5] . Such safety advantages also reduce purification costs and minimize production shutdowns and facility decontamination, thereby affecting patient/customer demand. Costs to purify plant-produced proteins are comparable to microbial or mammalian cell culture systems, but plants offer key advantages with lower up-front capital costs and potential economies of scale. Direct use of cultivated plant cells, whole or minimally processed plants, or plant parts (e.g., seeds, dried leaves) is in development for industrial/bioenergy applications as well as for therapeutics and vaccines, thereby further reducing costs of recombinant proteins [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Boosting protein yields is always a challenge for economic feasibility [2, 5] as are regulatory considerations, some of which are unique to plant bioproduction systems [1, 13] . Plant expression platform diversity includes: whole plants, suspension cells, hairy roots, moss, duckweed, and microalgae. There are strengths and weaknesses to each platform with selection often determined by type of recombinant protein, market, scale, cost, and up and downstream processing constraints of the specific protein product. Within each platform is also a diversity of plant species that can host the protein product. Platform diversity provides flexibility in expressing novel recombinant proteins, enables customizing and meeting scale-up needs, and provides opportunity for oral-based delivery of proteins. However, such diversity also may complicate regulatory compliance, which prefers more uniformity. Here we summarize prospects and challenges associated with each type of plant production platform and production strategy, and where appropriate, comments are provided on important regulatory issues and progress toward commercialization.",

Transgenic field plants are particularly attractive for producing industrial proteins/enzymes because agricultural production is low cost, protein products stored in specific organs such as seeds are stable, scale-up is easy and relatively fast, and crude plant materials can often be used directly in industrial processes [6, 7] . Industrial proteins of most interest are hydrolases, including glycosidases (e.g., cellulase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS)) and proteases (e.g., trypsin). The first company to develop and commercialize plant-based recombinant proteins/enzymes, with GUS and avidin being their first two commercialized products, was ProdiGene Inc. (formerly in College Station, TX), which is unfortunately now out of business [3, 7, 27] . Corn seed is considered an ideal platform for industrial protein/enzyme production because this plant has the largest annual grain yield and relatively high seed protein content (10%), offering the highest potential recombinant protein yield per hectare [28] . Regulation is a major hindrance to using plant-made industrial proteins/ enzymes because a large acreage of transgenic plants is needed. Use of a food/feed crop for nonfood/feed products may also meet political resistance when, as projected, global food supplies become limited, therefore requiring new solutions.",

Although transgenic plants can produce fully functional mammalian proteins, including blood proteins, vaccine antigens, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cytokines, therapeutic enzymes, growth factors, and growth hormones [5, [29] [30] [31] , bioactivity requires proper folding, disulfide bond formation, subunit assembly, and often proteolytic cleavage and/or glycosylation. Plants can produce lower-cost, safer therapeutic proteins than mammalian cells [30] and may be the only production system available, e. g., for production of secretory antibodies (sIgAs) [2] . These recombinant therapeutic proteins are produced using many different plant-based platforms including cells and field crops; the most common production species is tobacco. Protein yields have reached well over 25% of TSP [32] 247 mg L \u00c01 [33] . Plants successfully perform N-linked glycosylation of proteins at the signature recognition motif (N-X-S/T) with subsequent processing in the Golgi complex. As a result, plant glycans differ from those found in mammalian cells. Using plants as hosts to produce therapeutic glycoproteins results in addition of plant-specific xylose and \u03b1-1,3-fucose sugars; these may alter bioactivity or immunogenicity in humans [34, 35] . The \u03b2-1,4-galactose or sialic acid residues synthesized in mammals are not naturally produced in plants [31, [35] [36] [37] , so RNAi strategies have been used to engineer more humanlike glycosylation machinery in plants by knocking down fucosyl-and xylosyltransferases in plant transgenic lines expressing a human or chimeric \u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase [38] [39] [40] . Furthermore, tobacco plants infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens produced human antibodies with humanlike N-glycans when co-expressed with a chimeric human \u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase [41] . The first human-injected therapeutic with greatest clinical experience (Protalix's taliglucerase alfa; discussed further below) did not trigger significant patient antibody production [42] [43] [44] . Indeed, plant-specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs) may offer opportunities for producing novel recombinant proteins with enhanced function and efficacy as well as biosimilars [45] . \"Second generation\" plant-made pharmaceutical proteins are emerging, wherein therapeutic targets are specifically engineered to enhance or produce new therapeutic proteins that integrate novel motifs or fusion to facilitate protein assembly, delivery, trafficking, protein stability, serum longevity, or protein solubility in either the production host or the target organism (e.g., [31, [46] [47] [48] [49] ",

In vitro culture allows for precise control over growth and protein production, batch-to-batch product consistency, and a production process aligned with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) [5] . Due to its relatively high cost of production, in vitro cultures are often used to produce high-value protein therapeutics. Compared with the other plant-based platforms, in vitro cultures are more acceptable to the pharmaceutical industry with fewer regulatory and environmental concerns [50] . Like other bioreactor-based culture systems, scalability of in vitro cultures is limited by bioreactor capacity. However, because recombinant proteins can be secreted into culture media, downstream processing of recovery and purification of the proteins becomes less expensive than from whole plants [51] . Indeed, the first licensed pharmaceutical protein derived from plants for human usetaliglucerase alfa (Elelyso\u2122)was produced in carrot suspension cells. Examples of representative recombinant proteins produced using in vitro cultures are shown in Table 2 .",

The production of recombinant proteins in plant cell culture was first demonstrated in 1990 with the expression of a human serum albumin in tobacco cells [78] . Since then, a wide array of biologically active proteins, including antibodies, vaccine antigens, growth hormones and factors, Chimeric super-promoter consisting of three copies of the octopine synthase activator (Aocs) and one copy of the mannopine synthase activator (Amas) located upstream of the mannopine synthase promoter (Pmas) cytokines, and therapeutic enzymes, have been successfully produced in plant cell culture. See recent reviews [5, 50, 79] . Plant suspension cultures integrate the merits of whole plant production with those of microbial fermentation and mammalian cell culture [80, 81] . Plant cell culture inherits most of the advantages of plant-based production systems, particularly the ability to produce complex proteins with correct posttranslational modifications without risk of contamination by human pathogens. Plant cell cultures also can be rapidly propagated in bioreactors as homogeneous suspensions for large-scale production, growing fast in simple synthetic media with doubling times as short as 16 h [5] . A breakthrough in plant cell culture technology was made in May 2012 by Protalix Biotherapeutics (http://www.protalix.com), an Israel biopharmaceutical company, for a plant cell-produced therapeutic enzyme \u00c0 taliglucerase alfa \u00c0 finally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an orphan drug for Gaucher's disease.

Bright Yellow 2) cells. BY-2 cells are robust and fast growing and can multiply !100-fold in a week. They readily undergo Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and cell cycle synchronization [5, 81, 82] . Other commonly used cell lines include rice (Oryza sativa), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and carrot (Daucus carota). In fact, these cell lines derived from common edible crops may be more favorable than tobacco cells in terms of by-product levels and regulatory compliance [81] . Rice cell suspension cultures are used almost as widely as tobacco BY-2 cells due to availability of the sugar-sensitive \u03b1-amylase promoter system (RAmy3D) [83] . This promoter is induced by sugar starvation and has enabled high-level expression of many pharmaceutical proteins in rice cells, e.g., \u03b11-antitrypsin (rAAT) [33, 83] , hGM-CSF [56] , interleukin-12 [59] , and human serum albumin [60] , with highest secreted protein yields reaching 247 mg L \u00c01 for rAAT [33] . While these production levels are impressive, growth rates, and general characteristics and stability of rice cell lines are inferior to those of tobacco BY-2 cell lines; rice cell viability is significantly decreased when cultivated in a sucrose-starvation medium [80] .",

In addition, moss N-glycans are free of core \u03b1-1,6-fucose, a sugar structure typically present on the N-glycans of mammalian cell-derived proteins. The moss-made IgG lacking this sugar moiety was more efficient in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) than the mammalian cell-made counterparts [101] [102] [103] .",

For example, moss mutants were engineered with genes encoding plant typical glycosyltransferases knocked out from the moss genome [72, 74] and further engineered to knock in the gene encoding \u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase into the xylosyltransferase or fucosyltransferase locus, respectively [104] .

On the other hand, the bubble column, balloon, wave reactors, and variations thereof seem to be more effective thus far for scaling up in vitro cultures. Plant cell suspensions have been grown in nearly all types of liquid-phase bioreactors. The bubble column reactor (BCR; Fig. 1b ) is easy to construct in-house with a variety of design variations. Gas enters at the base of the vertical cylinder through a frit forming small bubbles that rise through the chamber, resulting in aeration and mixing; gas vents through a sterile filter at the top.

Duckweed is propagated clonally without the need for pollen or seeds, which simplifies line management, propagation, and the process feed stream [32, 117] . Duckweed is safe, fast growing in simple inorganic media (doubling time ! 36 h), capable of making complex proteins, and easy to grow and harvest and has a high protein content (up to 45% dry weight) [85, 118] . Cultivation only requires inexpensive upstream facilities and is very scalable. The absence of pollen or seeds also makes duckweed environmentally safer than other transgenic flowering plants. Moreover, duckweed is edible, offering an attractive system for oral delivery [119, 120] . Duckweed can be transformed using either biolistics or A. tumefaciens. Efficient nuclear transformation protocols for two species of duckweed, L. gibba and L. minor, were established in 2001 [121] , and >20 recombinant proteins were produced with expression levels up to 25% of TSP [32] . Products include industrial enzymes, e.g., E1 endoglucanase [122] , and many therapeutic proteins, e.g., mAb [123] , plasminogen [124] , interferon \u03b12 [125] , vaccine antigen avian influenza including H5N1 hemagglutinin [126, 127] , and M2e peptide [117] .",

Options include open systems such as ponds and raceways and closed systems such as tubular or plate photobioreactors. While possibly suitable for low-value commodity or industrial products, for products requiring strict GMP compliance, open systems are not recommended because they can be contaminated with a variety of other species and particulates and do not provide production source material consistency. There are also issues regarding environmental release of genetically modified species grown in an open pond. Although tubular or flat plate photobioreactors would seem best, these also have challenges. While the development of more cost-effective LED lighting is now available, these reactors cannot exceed certain culture depths. As culture density increases, light does not penetrate beyond several centimeters, and thus as the culture increases in density, growth decreases significantly. Although cGMP industrial facilities now exist for moss cultivation, to our knowledge, there is none yet for microalgae [31] . For a more in-depth discussion of photobioreactor designs and limitations, see the review by Xu et al. [139] .",

Stable transformation advantages include (1) a heritable transgene, permitting establishment of seed stock for future use, and (2) protein production scalable to field production. However, establishing and characterizing stable transgenic lines can be costly and time consuming. Other challenges include gene silencing, position effects, and GMO environmental concerns [132, 140] . When establishing stable transgenic plant lines, choices are often made regarding the gene integration site (nuclear vs. plastid), the subcellular compartment for recombinant protein accumulation (e.g., cytosol, apoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuole), and the plant tissue expression target (leaves vs. seeds). Decisions depend on a variety of considerations, including posttranslational modifications needed for protein functionality, stability of the expressed foreign protein in the plant host, desired expression levels of product, and downstream purification costs, as well as size and cost constraints of the product market [85, 95] .",

Tobacco has emerged as the leading plant species for leaf-based protein expression [142] because it produces high biomass yields (~300 tons per acre), is genetically well studied, and is readily amenable to genetic engineering [15] . Importantly, tobacco is a nonfood, nonfeed crop, which minimizes regulatory barriers by eliminating the risk of plant-made recombinant proteins entering the food supply [143] . The first clinical trial of a plant-produced biopharmaceutical was the secretory antibody variant of Guy's 13 produced in field-grown tobacco leaves by Planet Biotechnology Inc. [144] . Besides tobacco, other leafy crops, e.g., lettuce, alfalfa, and clover, have also been exploited as an expression platform. Alfalfa is advantageous because it is a perennial that fixes nitrogen and displays notable homogeneity of N-glycosylated recombinant proteins [85, 145] .",

Except for exceptionally highlevel expression, therapeutic proteins accumulated in the chloroplasts of lyophilized plant cells can be stored for several months or years without a decrease in their functionality, thereby eliminating costs of cold storage and transportation [162] .

Compared to other cereals, maize has a larger grain size, a higher proportion of endosperm ( 82% of the seed), and a higher biomass yield per hectare at lower production costs [173, 183, 184] . Many industrial enzymes, including GUS, cellulase, laccase, and trypsin, have been successfully produced in maize seeds and marketed [27, 184] . Therapeutic proteins such as the HIV neutralizing antibody 2G12 [185] , influenza virus H3N2 nucleoprotein [186] , and \u03b1-galactosidase [187] in maize seeds were produced cost-effectively with simple downstream purification processes. Other seed-based platforms in commercial development include rice seed-produced human transferrin [188] by US-based Ventria Biosciences (www.ventria.com/) and barley grain-produced endotoxin-free growth factors and cytokines (Orfeus\u2122 expression system) [189] by Iceland-based ORF Genetics Ltd. (www.orfgenetics.com/). Seeds from some oil crops such as safflower and rapeseed have been used to develop a novel \"oleosin-fusion\" bioproduction platform, in which recombinant proteins are expressed as a fusion with oleosin, an endogenous protein that localizes within oil bodies of rapeseed and safflower [190, 191] . Fusion proteins accumulated in the oil bodies are easily separated in the lipid fraction from the bulk seed homogenate. SemBioSys Genetics, a Canadian biotech company, was developing and commercializing this technology for the low-cost \"biosimilar\" insulin [85] , but operations ceased in 2012 due to financial problems.",

Compared to the leaf-based platform, seeds have a relatively lower biomass and high possibility of gene leakage into the environment via the seed or from pollen dispersal [15, 192] . There is strong reluctance among scientists, regulators, and the general public to use seeds of major crops (e.g., maize, rice, and wheat) for recombinant protein production because of the possibility of contaminating the food chain [192] . Considerable time is also required to create high-expressing transgenic plant lines [155] . However, the stability of foreign proteins, post-harvest processing, and overall cost makes the seed-based platform suitable for many recombinant proteins produced on a large scale [193] .",

During transient expression, foreign genes are typically introduced into leaves of plants by vacuum infiltration of Agrobacterium containing genes of interest in an expression vector [85] . Recombinant protein production within the plant tissues (usually leaves) can be initiated quickly, within 24 h, continuing for several days depending on vector and target protein. Because a high copy number of foreign genes is introduced into each plant cell and free of \"position effect\" on gene transcription, the protein yields are usually higher in transient than in stably expressed plants [196] . Since there is no transgenic plant created, this also addresses regulatory issues and public concerns for GMO plants [197] . As a result, transient expression has been increasingly used for production of biopharmaceuticals, in particular, antigen vaccines and antibodies [195, 197] .",

Potato, green pea, Arabidopsis, lettuce, and other Nicotiana species (e.g., N. debneyi, N. excelsior, and N. simulans) also serve as alternative hosts for transient expression [85] . There are two basic strategies for introducing transgenes into host plant cells for bioproduction: nonviral vector based or viral mediated [199, 200] . Nonviral vector-based expression using common plant expression vectors enables rapid accumulation of recombinant proteins in plant leaves, typically 2-4 days post-infiltration, with protein yields of 0.1-200 \u03bcg g \u00c01 FW [85] . The viral-mediated expression process takes~2 weeks for protein expression, but generally produces higher levels of recombinant protein up to 5.0 mg g \u00c01 FW GFP [201] . Some effective viral vector-based expression platforms include Geneware \u00ae (Kentucky BioProcessing LLC) and magnICON \u00ae (Icon Genetics) based on a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA replicon and the geminiviral expression system based on a bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) DNA replicon (Arizona State University) [202] [203] [204] .",

Numerous therapeutic proteins, especially those addressing sudden viral epidemics (e.g., an outbreak of Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or influenza pandemic) have been successfully produced by a transient expression system [132, 205, 206] . For example, Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. (San Diego, CA) used the geminivirus technology to transiently express the humanized antibodies MB-003 (Mapp) and ZMab in tobacco leaves (http://mappbio. com/z-mapp/). An optimized cocktail combining the best components of the MB-003 and ZMab was ZMapp\u2122, which cured 100% of Ebola-infected rhesus macaques primates [207, 208] . In another example, plant-produced influenza vaccine candidates, such as VLP antigens against avian flu (H5N1) virus and swine flu (H1N1) virus, were developed by the Canadian biotech company Medicago Inc. (Quebec, Canada) and have undergone Phase I and II clinical trials with positive results (http://medicago.com/pandemic-flu/). Plant-produced influenza vaccines are regarded as quicker to develop and potentially cheaper than egg-produced vaccines. Many other therapeutic proteins reportedly produced by the transient expression platform include IgG and IgA antibodies [209, 210] , vaccine antigens against malaria, influenza and HIV [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] , and therapeutic enzymes treating lysosomal storage diseases [216] ; see recent reviews [140, 195, 217, 218] .",

Similarly there are concerns regarding the risk of unintended environmental contamination of native gene pools by genetically modified field crops. An alternative is the use of controlled environment agriculture (CEA), where the transgenic crop is grown in glasshouses. Of course this increases production cost substantially, but may be worthwhile if there is high product value, e.g., for a therapeutic. CEA is not subject to seasonal variation, providing greater control over cultivation conditions and thus the quality of the crop and its contents. A number of companies have developed more or less automated cultivation systems under glass where product quality is maintained and aseptically handled in its final form. Medicago has developed such a CEA system whereby they hope to produce a number of different products via transient expression in tobacco. The production system begins after there is a synthesized gene of interest (GOI) from, for example, a virus. Then young N. benthamiana tobacco plants grown in pots in contained greenhouses are handled robotically including the vacuum infiltration step. Large pallets of plants are inverted into a solution containing the GOI and vacuum infiltrated. Afterward the inverted plants are drained and rotated back into vertical position and then moved into another more stringent culture facility for a 4-6-day incubation for gene expression and protein synthesis. Plants are subsequently moved to a harvesting area where leaves are stripped by hand and then extracted. Using methods applicable to any other clinical grade in vitro or microbial product, the target protein is purified. The process is documented in this video: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=lAk_HkFi9-s.",

These include selection of a crop species platform suitable for industrial production; in industry a diversity of platforms is problematic because of the need for consistent and stringent regulatory compliance, especially for therapeutics. Subsequently there should be an early stage determination of field vs. CEA cultivation. Similar to in vitro or microbial production, master seed or tissue banks must be established and maintained to provide batch to batch consistency. Isolation of GM plant material, controlled seed stock, APHIS/BRS permits for field-grown plants, appropriate confinement for transport of source plant material from field/ greenhouse to production facility, control of harvested material and its transfer to the processing facility, waste biomass control, storage control, are all needed for production operations that can be validated.",

However, ProdiGene went bankrupt in 2002 due to mishandling US field tests of maize genetically modified to make pharmaceutical products and received more than a $250,000 fine from USDA. Since then, efforts on commercializing plant-made industrial proteins have declined. Most of the research is now focused on production of biomass-degrading enzymes for the biofuel industry, e.g., cellulase, hemicellulase, xylanase, ligninase, \u03b1-amylase, and laccase [181, [225] [226] [227] . For example, an Arkansas-based start-up company, Infinite Enzymes (http://www. infiniteenzymes.com/), has been developing a cost-effective maize seed production system for cellulase enzymes for cellulosic biofuel production. It is noteworthy that in 2011, a transgenic variety of maize expressing thermostable \u03b1-amylase was approved by the USDA for commercial use as an improved biofuel feedstock. This transgenic maize line, marketed as Enogen\u2122, was developed by Syngenta (http://www2.syngenta.com/en/index.html) to produce \u00c0 within the kernel \u00c0 an enzyme needed to break down starch for biofuel production. However, it sparked a controversy not only from anti-GMO organizations but also from some biotech supporters because of environmental and human health issues [228] .",

Despite Dow AgroSciences receiving the world's first regulatory approval by USDA in 2006 for a tobacco cell-produced vaccine against Newcastle disease virus in chickens, it only remained a proof of concept; Dow AgroSciences never intended to market the product [231] . However, since the scale of animal vaccination is so large, plant-based systems may represent the only cost-effective production platform on a scale for which other (non-plant-based production) methods are not competitive. Furthermore, plant-made veterinary vaccines, such as those made in seeds, fruits, and leaves, can be orally delivered as part of the animal feed, thus offering great convenience and economy in immunizing large populations of animals on farms [232] . In terms of commercialization potential, regulatory approval for the plant-made veterinary vaccines can be significantly less onerous than that for human vaccines [233] . Therefore, the most likely near-term possibilities for commercialization of plant-derived vaccines will be the veterinary products. Key examples of plant-produced vaccines tested in target animal species, including those against avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, diarrheal disease caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, and swine transmissible gastroenteritis, are listed in recent reviews [231, 234] . These antigens were expressed in potato tubers, rice seeds, corn seeds, and N. benthamiana leaves. With continuing efforts to optimize the bioproduction platform, successful commercialization of plant-made veterinary vaccines is imminent. The recent outbreak of avian and swine flu spurred development of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Medicago developed the Proficia\u2122 technology, a transient plant expression platform for rapid and high-yield production of vaccines and antibodies, in particular, the viruslike particle (VLP)-based antigen (VLPExpress\u2122 platform). Their products are at various stages of development. For example, the vaccine candidates against various influenza strains (e.g., H5N1 and H1N1) in Phase I and II human clinical trials were found safe and well tolerated, and potency was among the most effective of the industry (www.medicago.com). Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (Osaka, Japan) acquired Medicago in 2013 and announced that its tobacco-based flu vaccine could hit the market by 2018 or 2019. Fraunhofer CMB (Newark, DE) developed another type of plant-made VLP vaccine, Pfs25-VLP, for blocking malaria transmission [236] . The Phase I trial of Pfs25-VLP was completed in 2016 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01867463). One of the unique features of plant-made vaccines is that plants not only serve as the production \"bioreactor\" but can serve as the delivery vehicle for oral vaccines [236, 237] . Professor Charles J. Arntzen, a pioneer in plant-made oral vaccines at Arizona State University, has been developing plant-based oral vaccines including HBsAg (Phase I in lettuce and Phase II in potato), Vibrio cholerae vaccine, heat-labile toxin B subunit of E. coli, and the capsid protein of Norwalk virus (all are Phase I in potato) [1, 2, 85] .",

            "text": "Therapeutics targeted for enzyme replacement therapies have been mainly developed by the Israel biopharmaceutical company Protalix Biotherapeutics. They developed and commercialized several recombinant therapeutic proteins through their ProCellEx \u00ae plant cell-based expression system (www.protalix.com). In 2012 Protalix commercialized Elelyso\u2122 (taliglucerase alfa for injection), the very first plant-made therapeutic ever approved by the FDA for human use and has been marketed in the USA, Canada, and many Latin American countries (Uplyso\u2122 in Latin America). Elelyso\u2122 has comparable enzymatic activity and uptake in macrophages and is structurally homologous to Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase), manufactured in CHO cells by Genzyme [57, 238] . Elelyso\u2122, however, is~25% less expensive than Cerezyme \u00ae because the plant cell-synthesized enzyme does not require further modification of its N-glycans for clinical use after bioproduction (terminal mannose residues are already exposed) [57] . Protalix's development pipeline for therapeutic enzymes includes PRX-102, a pegylated version of a recombinant human \u03b1-galactosidase enzyme for the treatment of Fabry disease; PRX-110, a chemically modified DNase I for the treatment of cystic fibrosis; and PRX-112, an orally delivered glucocerebrosidase enzyme for treatment of Gaucher's disease. To date, Protalix has successfully completed a Phase I clinical trial of PRX-112 in Gaucher's patients. In June 2016, the company initiated its Phase III clinical trial of PRX-102.",

About twenty ISOkine\u2122 products, such as IL-3, GM-CSF, EGF, TNF, SCF, etc., are also on the market (http://orfgenetics.com/ISOkine/ProductList/). Commercialization of several moss-made human growth factors, including FGF7/KGF (keratinocyte growth factor), EGF, and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) intended for mammalian cell culture, has also been achieved by Greenovation [77] . FGF7/ KGF is the first commercially available moss-made human protein. In addition, PRX-106, an oral formulation of anti-TNF\u03b1 for treatment of immune and inflammatory-mediated disorders, is through Phase I clinical trial by Protalix, showing that the drug was safe and well tolerated and had gut biological activity and induction of regulatory T cells (www.protalix.com).",

So far, iBio Biotherapeutics runs the world's largest plant-based vaccine production facility with the capacity to process over 3500 kg of plant biomass per week (http://www.ibioinc.com/). With the advance in both technologies and manufacturing facilities, plant molecular farming is now reaching the stage at which it may challenge established microbial and mammalian bioproduction systems.

Since 1999 CaroRx\u2122 was subjected to Phase II clinical trials (topical) for dental caries in the USA under an FDA-approved Investigational New Drug Application[229], but was discontinued in early 2016. ZMapp\u2122, a cocktail of three mAbs produced in tobacco leaves by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. to combat the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Africa, underwent clinical Phase I and II trials in 2015 in the USA, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)[132]. In September 2015, ZMapp\u2122 was granted a fast-track status by the US FDA (http://mappbio.com). Although it has not yet received final approval by FDA, to date, ZMapp\u2122 is the only drug that has been effectively used to treat patients infected with the Ebola virus[206]. In addition, a tobacco-derived HIV neutralizing antibody 2G12, produced by an EU funded project, Pharma Planta, recently completed a Phase I clinical trial[147].",
