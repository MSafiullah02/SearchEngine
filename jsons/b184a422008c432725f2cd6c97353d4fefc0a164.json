The aim of 54 this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and 55 COVID-19 in two cohorts. 56 Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalized patients with TB and 57 COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and 58 clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB 59 and COVID-19 mortality. 60 Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). 61 Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. The study findings show that: 1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; 67 2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and 3) migrants had lower mortality, probably 68 because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where 69 advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, 70 higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.",
