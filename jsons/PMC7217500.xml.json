An important example is stochastic chemical kinetics, which describes the time evolution of chemically reacting systems by taking into account the fact that molecules are discrete entities that exhibit randomness in their dynamical behavior. A master equation [3,4] can be used to model this probabilistic process. The number of variables in this equation is large for all but the simplest systems, so analytical or direct numerical integration methods are usually impractical. Alternatively, Monte Carlo samples of the stochastic process can be numerically generated via stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) [5].",

At the population level, the intrinsic and extrinsic noise was recently studied in influenza [19]. Uncertainty quantification is the process of deterministically computing the effect of input uncertainty in equations of interest.

In a previous publication [23] we showed that high-order approximations of the intrinsic noise in the master equation yield quantitatively different solutions. Here we examine the role of extrinsic noise on the master equation. We couple a high-order expansion of the master equation with a stochastic collocation method and analyze various sources of uncertainty modeled with uniform, beta, and gamma distributions. We show that depending on the distribution of the extrinsic noise, the master equation yields quantitatively different results compared to using the expectation of the distribution for the parameter. The use of a gamma distribution is based on an empirical study on the basic reproductive number in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18]. In epidemiological terms, the results show that extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they effect the speed of disease breakouts and that the gamma distribution should be used to model the basic reproductive number.",

Rather, the method here converges linearly with respect to the number of molecules and exponentially with respect to the order of the polynomials used in the stochastic collocation calculation. We note that there are restrictions on the applicability of the method as well as assumptions in the underlying model. Restrictions on the applicability of the method are (1) the stochastic process must be a so-called L2 random variable, meaning that it must have a finite second moment [22] and (2) the error term incident to the expansion of the master equation is inversely proportional to the system size and therefore may be inaccurate for small systems. For example, a process with extrinsic noise from a Cauchy distribution would violate the L2 assumption. We also make assumptions on the validity of the underlying model. Since the underlying equations rely on a compartmental model for the species, we assume that the system is well mixed such that mass action kinetics are valid. Moreover, we assume that the system is memoryless and subject to exponential waiting times between reaction events.",

The discrete shift operators are expanded by means of a power series [3,8,9]:\n(7)Li\u03bc(\u03a0(\u03be,t;\u03b2,\u03ba))=\u03a0(\u03bei+\u03bc\u03a9\u22121/2,\u03be\\i,t;\u03b2,\u03ba)\n(8)=\u2211j=02\u03c1\u22121\u03bcj\u03a9\u2212j(1/2)j!\u2202j\u2202\u03beij\u03a0(\u03be,t;\u03b2,\u03ba)+O(\u03a9\u2212\u03c1),where \u03bc\u2208{\u22121,+1} and \u03c1 is the order of the expansion. Inserting the ansatz and shift operators [Eq. (8)] into Eq. (6) and then collecting terms in decreasing powers of \u03a9 yield the desired power-series equation. Using the computer algebra system Mathematica, we expanded Eq. (6) to O\u03a9\u22122:\n(9)\u2202\u03a0(\u03be,t;\u03b2,\u03ba)\u2202t=\u2211j=0\u03a9\u2212j/2F\u2212j/2(\u03a0(\u03be,t;\u03b2,\u03ba))+O(\u03a9\u22122).The particular form of the functions F\u2212j/2(\u00b7) is provided in the Supplemental Material [25]. We note that the lowest-order approximation is the classical Fokker-Planck equation [3], which also justifies the ansatz. In order to obtain the set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of the moments of the distribution \u03a0(\u03be,t), we first define the moments, namely, \u0398(\u03be;\u03b2,\u03ba)t=\u222bR3\u0398(\u03be)\u03a0(\u03be,t;\u03b2,\u03ba)d\u03be, where \u0398(\u03be)=\u03be1k1\u03be2k2\u03be3k3, where the powers k1,k2, and k3 determine the moments. The equations for the moments are found by multiplying both sides of the expansion by \u0398(\u03be) and integrating over the domain:\n(10)d\u03b8(\u03be;\u03b2,\u03ba)tdt=\u222bR3\u0398(\u03be)\u2202\u03a0(\u03be,t;\u03b2,\u03ba)\u2202td\u03be,which therefore requires repeated integration by parts on the terms kept in the expansion. The set of nonlinear equations that govern the evolution of the moments was derived analytically. Let \u03bet\u225c(\u03be1t,\u03be2t,\u03be3t)T, i.e., the first moments of the stochastic process; then the first-moment corrections to the solution of the continuum reaction rate equations are\n(11)nt=\u03a9\u03b6(t)+\u03a91/2\u03bet.We note that in the lowest-order approximation, the Fokker-Planck equation, \u03bet\u22610\n[3].",

Shown in the right panel in Fig. 1 is a simulation using \u03b1~=\u03b2~=100, i.e., a comparatively small variance around E[\u03c1(\u03c7)]=3/2. It can be seen that the simulation is essentially equivalent to using a constant parameter. This is to be expected since the intrinsic noise becomes a factor when the reproductive number is near unity. Since a beta distribution centered around 3/2 has a very small probability near R0=1, no noticeable difference is discernible. To analyze the influence of the extrinsic noise on the infectious species, we will define an error metric between two approximations for the infectious persons (i=2) as follows:\n(19)l2=\u222b0Tf\u2329\u03be2\u232at(E)\u2212\u2329\u03be2\u232at(S)2dt,where \u03be2t(E) represents the infectious population of a model using only intrinsic noise and \u03be2t(S) represents the infectious population of a model using both extrinsic and intrinsic noise. Additionally, we have let \u03b2~=\u03b1~. This norm represents the time average of the squared distance between the two models. Figure 2 shows this norm plotted against the value used for both \u03b1~ and \u03b2~ in the distribution for the model \u03be2t(S). Note that the deviation increases as the variance of the input distribution increases. Additionally, we observe a nonlinear dependence on the variance of the input distribution.\n",

Importantly, the steady state of the solution is considerably different as the susceptible population never decreases beyond the recovered population. This difference when using a gamma distribution for R0 is notable since both the time-dependent and time-independent dynamics differ even for the simplest SIR model. Moreover, we have included the standard continuum equations in Fig. 3 to emphasize the effects of both sources of noise.\n",

To analyze the role of extrinsic noise in a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, we used the uniform, beta, and gamma distributions. While the difference was small in the case of a uniform or beta distribution, the gamma distribution caused the infection to peak earlier in time and therefore caused the infectious individuals to go zero earlier than the continuum model and stochastic models without noise. This is of importance to the public health community since a faster disease progression observed in empirical data may lead to an erroneous estimation of the reproductive number in a continuum model without extrinsic noise. We showed that the deviation away from the expectation of the extrinsic noise scaled nonlinearly with the variance of the input distribution. In epidemiological terms, the results imply that both intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they may affect the speed of disease breakouts.",
