SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV, which Panel E shows BAL fluid from a mouse exposed to PG-VG, which contained fewer identifiable macrophages and had minimal to no specific staining by oil red O. Without lipid staining, it is more difficult to distinguish between small alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes in these preparations. Panels F and G show findings in lung sections. In mice exposed to VEA (Panel F), alveolar macrophages (arrowheads and circles) in residence among pneumocytes (P) lining the alveoli (A) contained abundant oil red O-stained lipid. In mice exposed to PG-VG, tiny oil red O-stained granules in the cytoplasm of cells lining the alveoli, including pneumocytes (arrows) and alveolar macrophages (arrowheads), were observed. B denotes bronchiole.",

            "text": "caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries in 2002-2003. 1 The epidemic of SARS-CoV was successfully contained through public health interventions, including case detection and isolation. Transmission of SARS-CoV occurred mainly after days of illness 2 and was associated with modest viral loads in the respiratory tract early in the illness, with viral loads peaking approximately 10 days after symptom onset. 3 We monitored SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in upper respiratory specimens obtained from 18 patients (9 men and 9 women; median age, 59 years; range, 26 to 76) in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, including 4 patients with secondary infections (1 of whom never had symptoms) within two family clusters (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The patient who never had symptoms was a close contact of a patient with a known case and was therefore monitored. A total of 72 nasal swabs (sampled from the mid-turbinate and nasopharynx) (Fig. 1A) and 72 throat swabs (Fig. 1B) were analyzed, with 1 to 9 sequential samples obtained from each patient. Polyester flock swabs were used for all the patients. From January 7 through January 26, 2020, a total of 14 patients who had recently returned from Wuhan and had fever (\u226537.3\u00b0C) received a diagnosis of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) by means of reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assay with primers and probes targeting the N and Orf1b genes of SARS-CoV-2; the assay was developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples were tested at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Pre- We analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Fig. 1C) . Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat. Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza 4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV. 3 The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection 5 and suggest that case detection and isolation may require strategies different from those required for the control of SARS-CoV. How SARS-CoV-2 viral load correlates with culturable virus needs to be determined. Identification of patients with few or no symptoms and with modest levels of detectable viral RNA in the oropharynx for at least 5 days suggests that we need better data to determine transmission dynamics and inform our screening practices.
