Since capillary flow is not maximal under resting conditions, capillary recruitment is an adaptive mechanism as well.

Mistransfusion is thought to occur with a frequency between 1:14,000 and 1:18,000. Most reactions occur during or shortly after a transfusion. Clinical manifestations include fever; chills; chest, flank, and back pain; hypotension; nausea; flushing; diffuse bleeding; oliguria or anuria; and hemoglobinuria. General anesthesia may mask some of the clinical manifestations, and hypotension, hemoglobinuria, and diffuse bleeding may be the only signs. It should be noted that the signs of a severe hemolytic reaction might be missed while the patient is under general anesthesia or attributed to another cause.\u25aa\nAnaphylactic reactions are caused by binding of IgE; present with bronchospasm, edema, redness, and hypotension; and require urgent treatment with epinephrine, fluid infusions, corticosteroids and antihistamines, and other therapies as indicated by severity and progression of symptoms.\u25aa\nFebrile reactions may be an early sign of hemolytic transfusion reaction (but other symptoms should be present) or bacterial contamination of the blood product. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions usually occur in patients who have had prior transfusions; headache, nausea, and malaise are associated symptoms. The reaction is caused by leukocyte antibodies, and leukocyte-depleted red blood cells may be indicated for these patients. Antipyretics may decrease the symptoms if given before the transfusion; meperidine may decrease the severity of chills.\u25aa\nTransfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is in the top three of transfusion-related deaths, having a mortality of 50%. A form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, TRALI is also immune related and is usually noted within 6 to 12 hours after transfusion. Symptoms include hypoxia, dyspnea, fever, and pulmonary edema; treatment is supportive.\u25aa\nUrticarial reactions secondary to mast cell degranulation do not require that the transfusion be stopped; antihistamines may be given.\u25aaThese transfusion reactions are compared in Table 6-1\n.\n",

The stromal components of erythrocytes are removed, and the hemoglobin molecule polymerized or liposome encapsulated to prevent rapid renal excretion and nephrotoxicity. Cell-free hemoglobin solutions have two major problems. First, they have low concentrations of 2,3-DPG. The lack of 2,3-DPG shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen increases, and oxygen cannot be off-loaded at the tissue level. Second, they are nitric oxide scavengers and produce excessive vasoconstriction. Pulmonary hypertension and myocardial ischemia are risks; in fact, reports of death from myocardial infarction have delayed release of these solutions for general use. These solutions also result in platelet activation; release of proinflammatory mediators; methemoglobinemia; and, because of their color, interference with laboratory tests.KEY POINTS:Transfusion Therapy \n1.There is no set hemoglobin/hematocrit level at which transfusion is required. The decision should be individualized to the clinical situation, taking into consideration the patient's health status.2.If blood is needed in an emergency, type O\u2013packed cells and/or type-specific blood may be used.3.There are numerous tranfusion-related reactions, and vigilance while administering under anesthesia is a must because many of the classic signs and symptoms might be missed in a draped patient under general anesthesia.\n\nWebsite American Society of Anesthesiologists\nhttp://www.asahq.org\n\n",
