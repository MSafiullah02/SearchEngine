Amplicons of \u2248600 bp were obtained for samples from 5 patients: 4 boys 2-11 months of age (BCH2859A, BCH2892A, BCH2894A, and BCH3034A) and a 30-year-old man (PUMCH12286). BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov) of sequences of these amplicons showed that the 590-nt sequences had 94.0% identity with that of the EV-C104 prototype strain CL-12310945 The tree was generated with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Neighbor-joining analysis of targeted nucleotide sequence was performed by using the Kimura 2-parameter model with the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software version 4.0 (www. megasoftware.net/). Each strain detected in this study is indicated by a black circle and a specific identification code (BCH/PUMCH), followed by the patient number. Enterovirus 68, cocksackievirus (CV) A2, and echovirus (E) 3 (GenBank accession nos. AY426531, AY421760, and AY302553) were used as outgroups. PV, poliovirus. EV-C denotes the EV species to which EV-C104 belongs. Scale bar indicates evolutionary distance.",

Our data also confirm a wide distribution of EV-C104. 1 (1) . In particular, we are troubled by the first paragraph. The dispatch opens by listing bites from rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as one of the many risks faced by military personnel deployed to Afghanistan. Although technically a true statement, it is misleading in its perspective. Since 2001, \u22482,000 US soldiers have died in Afghanistan and another \u224818,000 have been wounded in action (2) . The authors juxtapose this toll with minor injuries incurred by 10 soldiers who flouted explicit rules prohibiting contact with pet monkeys.",

Furthermore, we agree that risk for monkey bites should be considered in perspective with other risks faced by deployed personnel. We also believe that action taken to decrease macaque populations in response to risks mentioned would be irrational and inappropriate; in a country affected by war, wildlife conservation efforts are needed. We did not intend to imply that the rabiesassociated death mentioned in our article was caused by contact with a macaque (2) . As reported elsewhere, the patient likely contracted rabies from a dog bite (3) .Nonetheless, we believe that risk for monkey bites deserves the attention of deployed medical providers. Risks for bacterial infection and major local trauma are critical for any macaque bite. We acknowledge that risk for contracting viral disease (rabies or B virus infection) from macaques in",
