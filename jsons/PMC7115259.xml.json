Because the project is voluntary, selection bias is a concern because those who choose to participate are concerned with proper respiratory protection and therefore may be more likely to practice it than those who did not participate. Convenience sampling was employed to interview HCWs, as not to interfere with patient care. This nonprobabilistic method can result in an under- or over-representation of the population of interest. Site visits were conducted during regular weekdays and took approximately 4 hours to complete. Because of the time frame and limited resources, it was not possible to interview workers during evening and night shifts. Whereas HCWs were cooperative in participating in the respirator demonstration, we were unable to observe N-95 use during patient care activities. Therefore, we could not accurately assess whether proper control measures were undertaken when a patient with airborne, influenza, or contact precautions was identified. Although the primary focus of the study was on EDs, they can become busy quickly, and it was not always possible to obtain the number of interviews desired.

Although better than the national average, this is still below the \u201cHealthy People 2020\u201d goal of 90% coverage among HCWs.9, 11, 12 Making vaccines available to HCWs at no cost, along with other initiatives implemented by hospitals, have helped to increase vaccination coverage.9 Many managers and HCWs surveyed also reported the success of initiatives such as mobile vaccination carts and mandatory declinations.",

As previously stated, selection of the appropriate PPE for specific tasks and infectious disease was a common issue. We recommended that the hospitals have a reference sheet readily available in a common area where employees could look to determine the PPE needed (for example, a flyer posted in the nurses' station). Another recommendation we made was to verify that employees knew what model/size N-95 respirator for which they had been fit tested. The majority of ED staff was aware of the model/size they needed (because they use N-95 protection frequently), but staff on other units (medical/surgical, intensive care unit) would sometimes state they were unsure of the model/size for which they had been fitted because they use respiratory protection much less frequently. As a possible solution, we recommended that staff be given a sticker at the time of fit testing with their model/size N-95 information written on it. This sticker could then be placed on their ID card (or in their locker) for quick reference.",
