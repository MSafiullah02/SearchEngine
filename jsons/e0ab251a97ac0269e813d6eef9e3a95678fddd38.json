(1, 2) The lung contamination by SARS-CoV-2 is typically characterized by a major difficulty to oxygenate the arterial blood. (3) This severe hypoxemia is associated with preserved respiratory mechanical properties, in particular the pulmonary system compliance. As recently quoted by Gattinoni et al (4) , the COVID-19 pneumonia seems to have 2 different phenotypes: the early phase, with severe hypoxemia and close to normal respiratory mechanics with a moderate effect of PEEP on lung recruitment; the later phase, corresponding to the more \"classic\" ARDS alteration of respiratory mechanics such as a reduced compliance with chest CT Scan images of diffuse ground-glass opacities and condensations. The hypoxia during the early phase seems to mainly result from an important ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch(5) associated with an altered pulmonary vasoconstriction. The \"protective\" mechanism called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) normally reduces the blood flow in poorly or non-ventilated areas towards aerated zones leading to reduce the (VA/Q) mismatch. HPV seems poorly functional in COVID-19 severe patients in absence of \"cor pulmonale\". (2) Most of the publications on severe COVID-19 describe intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, installed in prone positioning as an adjuvant therapy to limit hypoxia. The prone positioning in ARDS is supposed to facilitate alveolar recruitment, and to decrease the heterogeneity of compliance.(6) In theory, this modality should have a limited effect during the COVID-19 early phase. The recent publications demonstrated that the majority of patients improved PaO 2 after prone positioning,(7) which suggests another mechanism to improve PaO 2 .",

The brutal COVID-19 outbreak with many severe hypoxic patients prompted intensivists to test iv almitrine to improve HPV(12, 13) and to reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. The use of ECMO is limited to trained centres, which could not meet COVID-19-related demands.

The best response in PaO 2 increase starting from baseline was found significant only in the almitrine-treated group (p = 0.01), while it remained stable in controls. Figure 2 shows the individual data for both PaO 2 and ScvO 2 in both groups, which significantly increased only in the almitrine group. Eight over 10 patients increased their PaO 2 with almitrine, with no clear relation with the level of infusion rate. Of note, when the drug was available to continue, the increase in PaO 2 associated with almitrine infusion persisted (3 patients), which permitted to reduce the number of positioning changes. During this short perfusion time no hemodynamic side effects were observed and lactate remained stable (<1.5 mmol/L) (data not shown).",

(5, 13) In the present pilot study, almitrine was used as a test to restore, even though partially, the HPV in supine or prone positioning (Fig 2B) . The combination of these conditions (prone and almitrine) could then be seen as a combination of gravitational and This case control series has several limitations in addition to the small size cohort (17 patients). First, although the \"control\" COVID-19 patients were selected on stringent criteria to match the studied group, it was not randomized and could be biased. The stability in PaO 2 during 8 hours reinforced the credence in an almitrine effect. In absence of a drug shortage, all of these patients would have received almitrine. This shortage resulted from the small national stock of almitrine facing an important demand during the pandemic. Second, although the data were prospectively collected, the overwhelmed care team capabilities in a dramatic context explains why some data were missing. Third, for the same reason, we were not able to administer the drug .

The recorded parameters were: the ventilatory settings unchanged along the protocol, including FiO 2 , PEEP level, tidal volume (VT), peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure; haemoglobin concentration, blood gases simultaneously sampled on the arterial catheter and on the central catheter to assess central venous oxygen saturation ScvO 2 , and arterial lactate, right atrial pressure; cardiac output when possible (Mostcare\u00ae, Vygon, Ecouen, France). Similar data were collected on a matched control group of COVID-19 patients, matched on gender, age, BMI and duration of mechanical ventilation, with serial measurements corresponding to the duration of almitrine testing.

The individual responses related to almitrine infusion varied in amplitude between patients (fig2A), but 8 over 10 patients responded in term of PaO 2 with an average of 80mmHg increase from baseline to the most efficient dose of almitrine. In our experience, the patients admitted in ICU with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 lower than 100 mmHg required a rescue intubation and mechanical ventilation at FIO 2 close to 1. Standard ventilatory settings were used as previously reported in COVID-19(3), including moderate PEEP with a VT close to 6 ml/kg IBW. Among the non-ventilatory method to improve oxygenation, the prone positioning is leading with frequent and rapid increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 .(6) As recently stated by ATS(6), prone positioning improves oxygenation mainly through respiratory mechanics improvement, limiting the heterogeneity of the gas volume partition. The apparent benefit of prone positioning on PaO 2 in \"early\" COVID-19 with almost normal respiratory mechanics(18) strongly suggests that prone positioning improves hypoxia and reduces the intra-pulmonary VA/Q mismatch by another mechanism. The absence of cor pulmonale despite severe ARF in COVID-19 indicates a relative dilatation of the pulmonary vascular bed with a \"normal\" pulmonary blood flow.(19) The logical hypothesis was that the prone positioning is changing the partition of pulmonary blood flow towards better ventilated areas by gravitation. The severe VA/Q mismatch in COVID-19 associated with pulmonary vasodilation indicates an alteration in HPV.(5) Years ago, we and",

The small cohort of patients does not allow concluding about any additional effect of these therapies. Worthy of note, in 3 patients the repositioning from prone to supine under almitrine prevented the loss of the benefit of prone positioning on PaO 2 values. The observed results with almitrine would not be related to the spontaneous evolution of the patients as suggested by the stable PaO 2 in the control COVID-19. The PaO 2 increase associated with almitrine infusion was concomitant with a significant increase in ScvO 2 . This observation confirms the absence of tissue hypoperfusion with no large peripheral O 2 extraction, as suggested by the low lactate levels. This ScvO 2 increase provides a greater reserve for O 2 extraction in case of acute desaturation, and increased the level of dissolved O 2 , the diffusible form of oxygen to the tissues.(20)",
