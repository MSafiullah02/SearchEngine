More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common\nserotypes of IBV in North America are Arkansas, Connecticut (Conn), Delaware 072,\nGeorgia 08 (GA08), Georgia 98 (GA98), and Massachusetts (Mass).16 This genetic\ndiversity leads to the emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete\ncross-serotype protection by vaccines.29 The correlation of IBV\ngenotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported45; therefore, accurate genotypic\nidentification of IBV is an important step to identify IBV in clinical respiratory\ncases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and\nto better understand the epidemiology of this global virus.",

A second database was constructed with all of the\navian coronavirus S1 sequences (n = 7,328)\navailable in NCBI (as of 2017.09.08) and the chicken genome (hereafter, All-IBV\ndatabase). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI\nC++ ToolKit, https://ncbi.github.io/cxx-toolkit/), and each IBV sequence was\nassigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus\nGammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST\n(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases were compiled using\ndefault settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was used to assign IBV\nlineages to each read, as appropriate. The All-IBV database was used to assign a\ntaxonomic ID to each of the IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.

For nanopore\nsequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for\ndownstream analysis. Briefly, nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using\nAlbacore v.2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with the following\nparameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads_fast5/ \u2013recursive -t 4 -s\n/Output_files \u2013flowcell FLO-MIN107 \u2013kit SQK-LSK108 -o fastq). Porechop\n(https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for\nadapter-trimming (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default\nsettings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides representing the\nS1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq\n\u2013extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed/). After barcode and adapter\nremoval, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol,\nwhich includes centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier24 using the\nsequences in the above-mentioned BLAST databases. Briefly, basecalled reads\n(FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input. First, the\nbasecalled reads were aligned to the IBV-lineage-typing database using BLASTn\nand reads were clustered based on the read sequence alignment to the respective\nprototype sequence of IBV lineage. These read clusters were used to interpret\nthe presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For the\nidentification of IBV types, the lineage-based read clusters were individually\naligned to the All-IBV database, which produced subclusters of reads. Each of\nthese read subclusters potentially represents a different sequence of IBV and\nwas further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high\nsequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data\nanalysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore,\nthese read subclusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software\nv.11.1.3. (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineage-typing\ndatabase (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each\nsubcluster. A minimum threshold for the number of reads per consensus sequence\nwas not set because in 2 samples (sample 4 in run 1 and sample 12 in run 2),\nonly 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus\nsequences were built from all of the available IBV reads per subcluster. The\nconsensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \u201ctop\nhit\u201d from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \u201csequence\nidentity\u201d and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \u201cminimum mismatches\u201d\nand \u201ccoverage\u201d of query or subject sequence. For each sequence, the BLASTn\noutput with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches was\nused as \u201ctop hit\u201d in the final results.",

Although there is room for improving\nour new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used\nwithout egg culture.

Although AmpSeq did detect all genotypes in 4\nsamples, in 3 cases not all of the genotypes of IBVs were detected. A potential\nexplanation of partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative\nabundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that\namplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-rtPCR assays is more\nefficient given the small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1,600 bp\nfor AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are\nused in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of\nour current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence27 was not\noriginally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such,\na high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the\nchicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the\noriginal report for these target sequences.28 Future studies to reduce the\nproportion of chicken reads may increase the sensitivity of this assay.\nAdditionally, it is possible that certain genotypes are better complemented to the\nS1 primers than others and may outcompete those IBV genotypes\nfor amplification in the AmpSeq protocol. Also, increasing the total number of reads\ncollected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all of the genotypes in a\ngiven sample. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain\nmore reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization,\nand work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.",

However, the\ninterpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary\ndiagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as Centrifuge,24\nKraken,50 QIIME,5 and Mothur37 have been used to identify and\nprofile microbial species; however, the high error rate20 of nanopore reads translates\nto poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de\nnovo3,26 or\nreference-based18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other\ndeep-sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory\ntests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize\nusage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance\nrequirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant\nresult). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing\nan equal number of representative IBV sequences per lineage to detect and classify\nthe IBV reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification of\nIBV reads by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally,\nlineage-clustered IBV read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician\nto result in reads available for consensus building. The use of a final consensus\nalignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION\nsequencing.3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo\nassembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to\nbuild, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain\nmore than one type of IBV (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number\nof significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory follow-up tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may\nbe needed when dealing with low numbers of reads in clinical samples; however,\nfuture testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such\nconfirmatory testing.",
