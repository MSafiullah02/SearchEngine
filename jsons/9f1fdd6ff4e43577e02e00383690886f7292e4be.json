However, in order to satisfy the needs of its citizens, the strictest containment measures can be only executed for short period. This article compares two types of containment strategies: a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period and an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time. When to implement the strictest measure is also of interest. A dynamic prediction model is proposed and a simple tool is developed for policy makers to compare different containment strategies. As an example, a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases is considered assuming a 4% mortality rate. We found that compared with a constant containment strategy, adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and executing the strictest measures early will cause less mortality.",

There are many prediction models available for this kind of modeling (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . In predicting local COVID-19 spread, there are two major challenges. Firstly, number of actual infected cases is usually unconfirmed and could be far larger than confirmed cases because there are significant number of infected cases in incubation period and test kits may be insufficient. Secondly, regions that experienced earlier outbreaks can provide valuable information, such as the distribution of cure time, death time, and mortality rate (15) , but it is not easy to integrate these dynamic parameters into many current models.",

Policy r t described in Figure 1(c) Smaller value represents stricter containment measures*. *r t can be interpreted as the average number of newly infected case communicated per infectious person per day on day t, if nearly all the population are uninfected. The model will adjust these inputs with percentage of infected cases across time, which produces R t . Containment strategy comparison using inputs of Table 1. Cumulative distribution functions of death time and cure time with 4% mortality rate within 40 days are plotted in subfigures (a) and (b). Sub-figure (c) demonstrates three different containment strategies across time. Strategy A (black) has a constant strict level while strict level is allowed to change weekly from strategies B (blue) and C (red). Strategy B is similar to strategy C but implements the strictest measures two weeks earlier. The averages of r t for strategies A, B and C are all 0.21, which means that they have the same overall strict level. From sub-figure (d) and (e), we observe that strategy B results in the smallest number of infected patients and deaths. Overall, the adaptive containment strategies, B and C, end the outbreak faster.",
