Thus, the distribution, biomass, and production of E. pacifica have been studied extensively off north\u2010eastern Japan.\n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n To clarify the distribution and abundance of other euphausiids is important because spatial and temporal changes of species composition may influence the energy flow through the food web. Distribution of euphausiids off north\u2010eastern Japan has been fragmentally investigated,\n22\n, \n27\n but quantitative studies have not been done until now. In the present study, seasonal changes in the distribution and abundance of euphausiids along the coastal waters off north\u2010eastern Japan were investigated and discussed in relation to the temporal and spatial changes of oceanographic conditions and several predators off north\u2010eastern Japan.",

Off south\u2010eastern Hokkaido, the stations were set at approximately 100, 200, 300, 500, 1500, and 1700\u2010m isobaths. The March survey was conducted only off Sanriku. The cylindrical\u2010conical nets were obliquely towed at a ship speed of 2 knots from 15 m above the sea bottom to 0 m where the sea depth was shallower than 300 m, and towed from 150 to 0 m where the sea depth was deeper than 300 m. A flowmeter (Rigosha, Tokyo, Japan) was mounted in the mouth of the net to register the volume of water that passed through the net. The net was towed only at night at all stations except at stations along the zigzag acoustic survey lines between 100 and 300\u2010m isobaths off Sanriku and Joban in March and April. Filtered volume ranged 211\u20132860 m3 and averaged 888 m3 (\u00b1 449 m3 standard deviation, SD). Water temperature and salinity from 0 to 300 m depth or 0 m to the near bottom at stations where the bottom depth was shallower than 300 m were measured by conductivity\u2013temperature\u2013depth (CTD) measurements (Sea\u2010Bird 9 plus, Sea\u2010Bird Electronics, Bellevue, WA, USA). Immediately after collection, samples were preserved in 5% formalin on board. Numbers of adult stage individuals for each species of euphausiid was sorted and counted for each sample in the laboratory. More details on methods of sampling and measurements, and the results of seasonal changes in oceanographic features are found in Taki.\n25\n\n",

It occurred up to near 15\u00b0C at 100 m in April (not figured) and October, and up to 16\u00b0C in August. Conversely, it was relatively scarce at <2\u00b0C compared to Thysanoessa species. The relationship between temperatures and the relative abundance for each subarctic species closely reflected the seasonal variations of geographic distribution (2, 3). Euphausia recurva occurred in the widest temperature range among warm\u2010water species but showed higher abundance at high temperatures (15.2\u00b0 and 16.2\u00b0C at 100 m) in October and December, respectively (Fig. 6). Euphausia mutica also occurred in the wider temperature range and was relatively abundant at 11.4\u00b0 and 13.3\u00b0C in October and December, respectively. Euphausia hemigibba occurred in a warmer range than these two species, and showed higher abundance at high temperatures (15.2\u00b0 and 16.2\u00b0C in October and December, respectively), as E. recurva did. Euphausia gibboides was relatively abundant at 11.1\u00b0C in October but occurred down to approximately 4\u00b0C in December, equal to E. recurva and E. mutica. Euphausia similis occurred in the 8.5\u00b0\u221214.6\u00b0C area in October and occurred only at 14.1\u00b0C in December. Euphausia tenera occurred in the highest temperature range among these six species. It occurred in the 11.1\u00b0\u221215.1\u00b0C and 14.1\u00b0\u221216.2\u00b0C areas in October and December, respectively. The West North Pacific group (including 8 species shown in Table 1) occurred in the widest temperature range among warm\u2010 and transitional\u2010water species (Fig. 7). This group occurred in the 5.4\u00b0\u221215.2\u00b0C and 4.0\u00b0\u221216.2\u00b0C areas at 100 m in October and December, respectively, but was relatively abundant at high temperatures (15.2\u00b0 and 16.2\u00b0C, respectively) in both months. It should be noted that occurrences at cooler temperatures mainly comprised E. recurva (Fig. 6). The Boundary group (3 species) also occurred in the wide temperature range. This group was relatively abundant at 11.1\u00b0C in October. The West Pacific coastal group (4 species) occurred in 8.5\u00b0\u221214.6\u00b0C and 12.5\u00b0\u221214.1\u00b0C areas in October and December, respectively. The Equatorial water group (4 species) occurred in the highest temperature range among warm\u2010 and transitional\u2010water species. This group occurred in the 11.1\u00b0\u221215.1\u00b0C and 14.1\u00b0\u221216.2\u00b0C areas in October and December, respectively.",

From the present study, the low biomass of E. pacifica off south\u2010eastern Hokkaido in spring (2, 3), probably caused by unfavorable temperature conditions (Fig. 5), is suggested to be a reason for the relative importance as food declined.

These species rarely occurred during summer and autumn in the total survey area in the present study (2, 3).

Therefore, the difference in annual distributional pattern of subarctic euphausiids might reflect that of cold water mass distribution.
