[2] [3] [4] Historically the most commonly stated causes of metabolic acidosis in diarrheic calves were fecal bicarbonate loss, electrolyte and water loss, and L-lactic acidosis. 5, 6 More recently, acidemia in sick calves, with or without diarrhea, was primarily attributed to hyponatremia accompanied by normochloremia or hyperchloremia, increased strong unmeasured anions particularly D-lactate ([D-lac \u00c0 ]), and to a lesser extent increased plasma protein concentrations. 7 Two approaches have been used to evaluate acidbase imbalances, the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach (H-H) 8 and more recently the physicochemical approach. 9, 10 The H-H centers on plasma bicarbonate ([HCO 3 \u00c0 ]) and extracellular base excess (BE (ecf) ) con-centrations as indicators of the metabolic components of acid-base balance. This approach is clinically useful for assessing acid-base disorders; but it is more descriptive than mechanistic and ignores the importance of relative strong electrolyte and protein concentrations in the determination of acid-base balance. 11, 12 The quantitative physicochemical approach emphasizes the importance of strong electrolytes (Na + , K + , Cl \u00c0 ), strong unmeasured anions (including L-lactate \u00c0 [L-lac \u00c0 ] and D-lactate [D-lac \u00c0 ]), pCO 2 , and the total plasma protein concentration (A tot ) in determining plasma pH and [HCO 3 \u00c0 ] . 9 This approach is mechanistic and provides additional information regarding the pathophysiology of acid-base imbalances.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 461, "end": 463, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 914, "end": 916, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1338, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1341, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1640, "text": "3 \u00c0 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Altered demeanor is associated with the degree of hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, hypothermia and dehydration.

Furthermore, dehydration correlates with blood [L-lac \u00c0 ] concentration. 19 There is an association between BE (ecf) and [HCO 3 \u00c0 ] and changes in the posture, behavior, and suckling reflex of calves with diarrhea. 15, 20 Increased serum concentration of [D-lac \u00c0 ] occurs in calves with diarrhea with or without signs of dehydration. [21] [22] [23] The variations in behavior and posture of diarrheic calves can be better explained by an increase in serum [D-lac \u00c0 ] rather than by a decrease in BE (ecf) . 24 In support of this, alterations in behavior and posture, impairment of the palpebral reflex, somnolence, and staggering gait occurs after intravenous administration of sodium [D-lac \u00c0 ] or isotonic D-L-lactate to healthy calves 25 ; whereas experimentally induced severe, uncomplicated, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis does not result in changes in posture or mental status. 26 These studies indicate that metabolic acidosis without an appreciable increase in [D-lac \u00c0 ] had only a minor influence on posture and behavior. 18 The routine measurement of plasma [D-lac \u00c0 ] is not currently a common practice in veterinary medicine. Clinicians assume that other frequently calculated acidbase parameters such as anion gap (AG) are sufficient for predicting changes in the concentration of the unmeasured anions. A useful clinical application of the physicochemical approach is calculation of the strong ion gap (SIG). SIG represents the difference between unmeasured strong ion cation concentration and unmeasured strong ion anion concentration in plasma or serum. SIG treats total plasma protein and phosphate concentration as variables, whereas AG assumes they are constants. 11 Both AG and SIG were intended to identify the presence of increased concentrations of unmeasured anions such as D-and L-lactate and uremic acids. 27 We hypothesized that increased plasma concentration of unmeasured anions are the major independent variable influencing changes in measured plasma pH and calculated plasma HCO 3 \u00c0 and that UAs and strong UAs, estimated by AG and SIG, respectively, are more strongly associated with alteration of demeanor in calves with diarrhea compared to other acid-base variables.

Acidemia was predominant because of an increase in the strong UAs concentration (increased SIG) and changes in the concentration of the mea-sured strong ion concentration (SID 3 ). Increase in the total plasma protein concentration resulting in weak acids acidosis only had a minor contribution to the acidemia in this group of calves. Stewart's major contribution to the understanding of clinical acid-base physiology was his proposal that plasma [H + ] is determined by 3 independent factors: pCO 2 , [SID], and A tot \u00c0 . 9 SID has 2 components: measured SID and unmeasured SID (SID um ). 7 The simplified strong ion approach quantifies the unmeasured strong ions by calculating the SIG from values of plasma or serum concentration of strong anions and strong cations, the total protein or albumin concentration, and experimentally determined values of A tot and pK a in calf plasma, and can be used interchangeably for SID um . 7, 10, 32 Theoretically, [SID] can be altered in several ways to produce metabolic acidosis, such as a reduction in [Na + ], an increase in [Cl \u00c0 ], endogenous production of strong anions (L-lactic acidosis), absorption of strong anions (D-lactic acidosis), and impaired excretion of unmeasured anions (uremic acids). 7,33,34 Plasma , bicarbonate; pCO 2 , partial carbon dioxide pressure; SID 3 , strong ion difference; SIG, strong ion gap; A tot , total plasma concentration of nonvolatile weak acids. P < .0001 for all the variables' coeffficients. electrolyte disorders including hyponatremia, in the presence of normochloremia or hyperchloremia, were observed in some of the calves in these data sets and were the likely cause of the decreased of the SID 3 . This finding confirms the important role of hyponatremia, attributed to excessive loss of sodium into the gastrointestinal tract and decreased milk intake because of anorexia, 6, 35, 36 in producing acidemia and strong ion acidosis in calves with diarrhea. 7 In this retrospective study in calves with diarrhea the major contributor to the changes in plasma pH and HCO 3 \u00c0 was an increase in unmeasured anions. Combined the SIG and SID 3 accounted for 77 and 93% of the changes in the measured venous pH and calculated HCO 3 \u00c0 in calves of DS1, respectively, whereas SIG and SID 3 accounted for 64 and 93% of the changes in the measured venous pH and calculated HCO 3 \u00c0 in calves of DS2, respectively. Similar results were reported previously in sick calves in which SID um and SID 3 accounted for 58-75% of the changes of the calculated pH; it was presumed that [D-lac \u00c0 ] was the predominant unmeasured anion. 7 Hyper-D-lactatemia occurs frequently in diarrheic calves. [21] [22] [23] [D-lac \u00c0 ] acid is a major contributor to anion gap acidosis, accounting for approximately 64% of the total increase in organic acids in plasma. 21 Malabsorption of nutrients in the small intestine of patients with short bowel syndrome and subsequent fermentation by colonic bacteria result in D-lactic acidosis in humans. 37 D-lactate concentrations are significantly higher in rumen content, feces, serum, and urine in diarrheic calves with acidemia as compared to normal calves. 22, 38 Our findings support the clinically useful application of SID theory in the calculation of the SIG to quantify the unmeasured strong anion concentration such as [D-lac \u00c0 ] and [L-lac \u00c0 ] in calves with diarrhea, and the calculation of SID 3 to quantify the effects of [Na + ] and [Cl \u00c0 ] on acid-base status. 39 Strong ion gap may also be reduced by an increase in the strong anions such as L-lactate. There is a strong evidence that neonatal diarrhea predisposes calves to septicemia. 3, 28, [40] [41] [42] One of the most important consequences of the septicemia is the compromise of organ perfusion because of the arterial hypotension. Furthermore, endotoxin impairs oxygen extraction by tissues. 43 As a result, anaerobic glycolysis, combined with direct inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by endotoxin, generates severe L-lactic acidosis. 44, 45 Contradictory results regarding the contribution of the concentration of [L-lac \u00c0 ] to the acidemia in diarrheic calves have been reported. In some studies, the contribution of [L-lac \u00c0 ] to the metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea has been attributed to the severity of the dehydration and the age of the calf, 19, 22 whereas other studies have shown that [L-lac \u00c0 ] was a minor contributor the acidemia in diarrheic or severely dehydrated calves. 22, 26, 46 The results of this study revealed that a high proportion of the calves were dehydrated and had strong ion metabolic acidosis, and that one-third were considered to be septicemic, 70% of which did not survive. These findings suggest that some of the calves were in a progressive or irreversible phase of hypovolemic or septic shock or both where hypotension and hypoperfusion develop, leading to an increase in plasma [L-lac \u00c0 ], which could have contributed in part to the increased concentration of the unmeasured strong ions detected by the calculation of the SIG. 47 L-lactate concentrations were not measured in the calves included in this study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1137, "end": 1139, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1143, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1167, "text": "[SID]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2076, "end": 2078, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2082, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2872, "end": 2876, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2877, "end": 2881, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2882, "end": 2886, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3369, "end": 3372, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3862, "end": 3864, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3868, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3869, "end": 3873, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3874, "end": 3878, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3879, "end": 3883, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4222, "end": 4225, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 4547, "end": 4550, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4684, "end": 4687, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4688, "end": 4691, "text": "26,", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Based on our results, we speculate that the causes for the strong ion acidosis in this group of calves include (1) increased loss of fluid with high [Na + ] and low [Cl \u00c0 ] through the feces; (2) increased plasma [L-lac \u00c0 ] caused by dehydration and septicemia; and (3) absorption of [D-lac \u00c0 ] from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings emphasize the importance of identifying the presence of strong UAs by calculating SIG when applying the physicochemical approach. Additionally, this study highlights the role of strong ions in the acid-base status of calves with diarrhea, and indicates that replacement fluid therapy in animals with diarrhea should be aimed at resolving volume deficits, improving peripheral perfusion, and correcting [Na + ] and [Cl \u00c0 ] imbalances. 48, 49 This retrospective study revealed that clinical scores for posture, attitude, and suckle reflex were influenced primarily by the magnitude of the increased plasma concentration of unmeasured strong anions (increased SIG and AG). Early studies demonstrated that demeanor and posture in calves with diarrhea were influenced by the degree of metabolic acidosis, 16 and that base deficit had the strongest correlation with alteration of demeanor, 16, 24 behavior, 24 and suckle reflex. 20, 24 Conversely, a recent study failed to demonstrate that severe, uncomplicated, hyperchloremic acidosis was associated with the demeanor abnormalities accompanying neonatal calves with diarrhea. 25 Calves with naturally acquired diarrhea have variations in behavior, posture, and palpebral reflex, but not in the suckle reflex, that could be better explained by increases in serum [D-lac \u00c0 ] than by decreases in base excess. 24 Both natural and experimentally induced hyper-D-lactatemia in calves produced an impaired palpebral reflex, somnolence, and a staggering gait, but no impairment of the suckling reflex. 18, 50 It has been suggested than metabolic acidosis without appreciable increase in [D-lac \u00c0 ] has only a minor influence on posture and behavior of calves with diarrhea 51 ; however, posture and especially demeanor normalized after correction of the acidemia with sodium bicarbonate despite a persistent increase in [D-lac \u00c0 ] concentration in calves with diarrhea and metabolic acidosis. 51 Moreover, in 1 study of calves with naturally acquired diarrhea and strong ion acidosis that were treated with intravenous solution of sodium, behavior was normalized despite of the persistent increases in [D-lac \u00c0 ] above 3 mmol/L. 30 In this retrospective study SID 3 and pCO 2 did not correlate with changes in attitude, suckle reflex and posture; additionally, A tot was not significantly correlated with attitude and suckle response although it did correlate with posture. This supports the hypothesis that unmeasured strong anions including [D-lac \u00c0 ], [L-lac \u00c0 ], and uremic anions can be the major cause for deteriorating demeanor parameters, and suggest that fluid volume replacement to re-establish tissue perfusion and diuresis with polyionic crystalloid alkalinizing solution is crucial for the treatment of calves with diarrhea.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 777, "end": 780, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 781, "end": 783, "text": "49", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1230, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1269, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1887, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There were several limitations to our findings, most notably the retrospective design, as well as the selected population being referred to the VTH, which would tend to be biased toward sicker patients.

A further validation of these results through a prospective study is warranted. Finally, 1 potential limitation of this study was the use of 2 different blood gas analyzers with 2 different values of S and pK 1 \u2032 for calculation of plasma HCO 3 \u00c0 from pCO 2 and pH values. 52 Assigned values for S and pK 1 \u2032 for DS1 were 0.0306 mmol/L/mmHg and 6.099 mmol/L, respectively; assigned values for S and pK 1 \u2032 for DS2 were 0.0307 mmol/L/mmHg and 6.095 mmol/L, respectively. However, the rearrangement of the H-H equation as pH = [(\u00c0log 10 K 1 \u00c0 log 10 (S)] + log 10 (HCO 3 \u00c0 /pCO 2 ) permitted the combination of the 2 constants into one, expressed as [pK 1 \u00c0 log 10 (S)].
