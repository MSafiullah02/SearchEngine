Nonetheless, as the pandemic seems to sustain and lead to prolonged social isolation and adverse economic effects, researchers and clinicians have expressed concerns regarding the potential negative effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general population (Ornell et al., 2020), with recent studies producing evidence supporting these concerns. For example, Wang et al. (2020) reported elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, and above-cutoff event-related symptoms of PTSD among the Chinese population during the first outbreak, with no significant reductions in anxiety and depression levels four weeks later at its peak. Similarly, Cao et al. (2020) reported that 21.3% of the student population in China were experiencing mild anxiety, 2.7% were reporting moderate anxiety, and 0.9% were suffering from severe anxiety. These findings suggest that the pandemic has an adverse effect on the population's mental health, thus stressing the need to investigate not only its scope, but also its origins.",

            "text": "One of the central factors which might produce elevated levels of stress and anxiety during the pandemic is the fear of COVID-19, and specifically the fear of either being infected, or of infecting loved ones. Colizzi et al. (2020) recently warned that the fear of infection may exacerbate pre-existing mental health disorders or elicit extreme anxiety reactions. They illustrated the effect of fear of COVID-19 by a case report of a 16-year-old adolescent presenting with COVID-19-like symptoms and extreme and persisting health preoccupations, triggered by the fear of being infected. Other studies have demonstrated that intense fear of COVID-19, and particularly being in the proximity of a close relative or friend with COVID-19, are significant predictors of posttraumatic stress (Sun et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Furthermore, Morelli et al. (2020) reported that ischemic strokes have almost disappeared from the emergency room in a general hospital in Milan (compared to an annual average of 612 new cases of ischemic stroke, and a monthly average of 51 cases), and suggested that this disturbing reduction is attributable to the fear of being infected. These findings stress the importance of reliably assessing the fear of COVID-19, so as to predict and control its effects on both healthy and mentally ill populations.",

            "text": "Measures aimed at evaluating specific fears of COVID-19 have recently begun to emerge. Qiu et al. (2020) developed the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), a broad self-report questionnaire assessing different aspects related to the pandemic, such as level of social functioning and frequency of anxiety, depression, and specific phobias. Utilizing this measure, they found that nearly 35% of the population in China experienced psychological distress. Recently, Ahorsu et al. (2020) developed a more concise tool to specifically address the fear of COVID-19 (Fear of COVID-19, FCV-19S). The scale consists of seven items generated by participant interviews, expert evaluations, and after a thorough review of various valid fear scales. Assessing its factor structure, the authors reported a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties. The scale has been adopted in India and the UK (Harper et al., 2020; Sakib et al., 2020), and was found to sustain its stable psychometric properties as well as to predict positive behavior change (e.g., improved hand hygiene, social distancing). Thus, as the pandemic seems to have struck many nations across the globe, the need to evaluate the scale's factor structure, its psychometric properties, as well as its associations with imperative and culturally-specific factors in different countries, has become eminent.",

Eighteen percent of the sample reported that they were in an at-risk group, and 0.6% reported that a family member of theirs had died of COVID-19.

The results of the exploratory factor analysis revealed a unidimensional factor structure which explained 53.71% of the variance, but when forced to a two-factor structure model, the two emerging factors explained 65.76% of the total variance. These factors included items representing emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Cronbach's alpha for the unidimensional model was 0.86, and for the two-factor models they were 0.77 and 0.80. An examination of the construct validity indicated that the scale was highly related to anxiety and stress, followed by depression. Furthermore, Factor 2 (symptomatic expressions of fear) was highly correlated with the anxiety scale of the DASS. Several demographic factors were associated with elevated COVID-19 fear, such that female participants reported higher rates of fear than did male participants, and participants who had a low SES reported higher rates of fear than did those with a high SES. Moreover, self-reported chronic illness, perceived increased risk for disease-related adverse outcomes, and having a death in the family due to COVID-19 were positively associated with the fear of COVID-19.",

Although past analyses of this scale pointed to a unidimensional model (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Sakib et al., 2020), our findings provide support for a two-factor structure model, separating emotional fear reactions from symptomatic expressions of fear. Together, these two factors explained a larger proportion of the variance, as well as indicated a differential pattern of association, with Factor 2 (symptomatic expressions of fear) highly correlating with the anxiety scale of the DASS (r=0.46, p<.001). As the fear of the pandemic can be considered a normal response to a life-threatening situation, and in some circumstances may benefit the individual by minimizing engagement in risky behaviors and promoting virus-mitigating responses (Harper et al., 2020; Pakpour & Griffiths, 2020), this division may allow researchers and clinicians to differentiate between fear and its associated symptoms. Such a distinction is important as past studies have shown that fear symptomology may lead to the development of common mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders (Asselmann et al., 2014).",

These findings correspond with recent studies which found the same trend of differential emotional distress reactions among male and female participants (Limcaoco et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Sakib et al., 2020). The higher rates of fear among women can be associated with gender differences in sensitivity to stress, as women display a higher vulnerability to stress, as well as an increased risk for developing mental disorders following stressful life events (Tolin & Foa, 2008). Higher fear was also observed among individuals with a low SES, a finding that resonates with past studies which reported a higher prevalence of psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity among this population stratum (Kun et al., 2009; Lorant et al., 2003). One potential explanation to account for this finding is that proneness to distress is associated with poorer coping styles, weaker social support, and poor access to healthcare, which are more prevalent in groups with a lower SES (Adler & Snibbe, 2003).",

These findings indicate that personal relevance of the pandemic facilitates a fear reaction among the study participants. In a recent study conducted by Mertens et al. (2020) among 439 participants from 28 different countries, personal relevance such as health risk for loved ones was found to predict fear of COVID-19. It may be suggested that personal relevance of the pandemic, such as personal increased risk or personal loss, can affect an individual's perceived coping potential, or the psychological resources needed to overcome a potential threat (Taylor & Stanton, 2007). Consequently, when the personal risk is perceived to be high, coping ability may be undermined, thus affecting the overall levels of fear. Such a potential exploratory path should be subjected to additional research.",

Moreover, identifying the levels of this specific fear among different populations and their associations with specific demographic variables (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status, pre-existing conditions, etc.) could assist in locating potential risk groups.

Future studies should aim to utilize other measures that would enable a more in-depth analysis. Second, although the sample assessed in the present study was large, convenience sampling may be limited in its ability to reach all strata of the population (for example, individuals with no internet, or the elderly population). Finally, the fact that a large percentage of the sample comprised female participants might affect the generability of our findings.
