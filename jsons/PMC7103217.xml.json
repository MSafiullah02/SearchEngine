They are highly diverse (>1000 species) and possess many unusual anatomical and physiological adaptations including flight, longevity, diverse thermoregulation, echolocation and constrained genome size (Calisher et al., 2006, Sulkin and Allen, 1974, Smith and Gregory, 2009). Bats are also known to harbour a huge range of viruses and have been increasingly implicated as carriers and/or natural reservoir hosts of numerous zoonotic viruses (Calisher et al., 2006, Wong et al., 2007). Fruit bats are known reservoir hosts of Hendra virus (Murray et al., 1995, Halpin et al., 2000), Nipah virus (Chua et al., 2000), Ebola virus (Leroy et al., 2005), Marburg virus (Towner et al., 2009), Melaka virus (Chua et al., 2007), and Australian bat lyssavirus (van der Poel et al., 2006, Speare et al., 1997), whereas microbats are known reservoir hosts of Rabies, and likely reservoir hosts of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Although many of the viruses carried by bats are highly pathogenic in other mammals, experimental infections and virus isolation studies have demonstrated that infected bats rarely display clinical symptoms associated with disease (Williamson et al., 1998, Calisher et al., 2006, Middleton et al., 2007, Towner et al., 2009). One unique aspect of bat biology that may be related to the role of bats as viral reservoirs was revealed in a recent study of bat DNA transposons. In contrast to other mammalian lineages, in which it was widely believed that DNA transposon activity had ceased at least 40 million years ago, multiple waves of extensive and recent DNA transposon activity were identified in the genomes of two microbat species. Speculating upon a possible connection with the ability of bats to withstand viral infections, the authors proposed either a general tolerance of bats for \u201cgenomic parasitises\u201d, or that the extensive acquisition of DNA transposons may in fact be a consequence of bats\u2019 tolerance of viruses (Ray et al., 2007, Ray et al., 2008). In contrast to bats\u2019 seeming ability to withstand viruses, some hibernating species are highly vulnerable to fungal infections, as seen by the emergence of white nose syndrome in North America (Blehert et al., 2009). As a result of these observations, the question has been raised of whether bat immune systems may be qualitatively different to other mammals, particularly in response to viral infections. However, few studies have examined the innate or adaptive mechanisms involved in resistance to viral infection in any species of bat.",

TLRs are considered by many to be the first line of defence, as they are located either extracellularly or in endosomal compartments, and thus are the first receptors to come into contact with invading microorganisms. TLRs are type-I integral membrane proteins characterised by a ligand binding, extracellular domain containing multiple leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions, a transmembrane (TM) domain and a highly conserved Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain which transduces signals and induces expression of innate immune response genes (Uematsu and Akira, 2007).",

In numerous cases vestigial TLRs are present as pseudogenes, such as TLR10 in mice (Hasan et al., 2005) and TLRs 11 and 12 in humans (Roach et al., 2005). TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 are located in endosomes, and are important for innate immune recognition of microbial nucleic acids (Xiao, 2009). TLRs 3, 7, 8 recognise viral RNA, whereas TLR9 recognises viral, bacterial and protozoan DNA (Xiao, 2009, Uematsu and Akira, 2006). TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are cell surface expressed and bind various protein, lipid and carbohydrate moieties in bacteria, protozoa and fungi (Uematsu and Akira, 2006, Yarovinsky and Sher, 2006, Roeder et al., 2004). TLRs 2 and 4 have also been demonstrated to bind viral proteins (Kurt-Jones et al., 2000, Bieback et al., 2002). Ligands for TLRs 10, 12 and 13 have not been identified, however TLR13 (as well as TLRs 3, 7 and 9), has been shown to interact with Unc93B1, a molecule involved in transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal compartments, thus indicating that it may be a virus-sensing TLR (Tabeta et al., 2006, Brinkmann et al., 2007).",

Preliminary alignments of nucleotide sequence data from P. alecto and P. vampyrus confirmed that the two bats were very closely related at the genetic level, and suggested that TLRs 1 and 6 had approximately 1000 bp of nearly identical sequence at the 3\u2032 end. To resolve this, 3\u2032 RACE primers for these genes were positioned upstream of the homologous region, and for all of the TLRs, the entire coding region was amplified by PCR as a single large product for sequence confirmation. As a result, it was shown that P. vampyrus TLR1 and TLR6 genes were miss-assembled in Ensembl, where they are represented as a single gene rather than two loci. The P. vampyrus gene identified in Ensembl as TLR1 is a chimera consisting of \u223c1300 bp from the 5\u2032 end of TLR1 followed by \u223c1000 bp of TLR6.

Based on the confirmed P. alecto mRNA sequences, it was possible to reassemble genomic DNA sequences for P. vampyrus TLRs using shotgun sequence data available in the GenBank trace file archive, enabling a more accurate comparison of P. alecto mRNA with P. vampyrus genomic DNA. Alignments of P. alecto mRNA and P. vampyrus genomic DNA were performed for each gene, to determine the intron\u2013exon organisation and splice sites of TLRs of the two pteropid bat species (Fig. 1\n). Due to gaps in some of the introns within the P. vampyrus genome, some of the intron sizes had to be estimated, however in all cases splice site consensus sequences were used as the basis for assigning intron\u2013exon junctions. TLRs 2, 6, 9 and 13 were each found to consist of two exons, while TLRs 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10 each consisted of three exons. TLR3 consisted of five exons.

To verify this, the domain architecture of the P. alecto TLRs were determined by SMART analysis, which combines homology searches with predictive algorithms to identify putative protein domains. Signal peptides, LRR domains and TIR domains were identified in P. alecto TLRs 1\u201310 (Fig. 3\n). TM domains were identified by SMART in all P. alecto TLRs with the exception of TLR9. SMART utilises a hidden Markov model for prediction of TM domains (TMHMM) and also fails to identify TM domains in TLR9 in other species, including human (not shown). An alternative method, HMMTOP, also failed to predict a TM domain, however TMPRED and hydrophobicity modelling enabled identification of the TM domain of P. alecto TLR9 (Fig. 4a). When P. alecto TLR5 was examined using the above methods, two putative TM domains were predicted with high probability scores using all three predictive models as well as hydrophobicity modelling (Fig. 4b). The second predicted TM domain was located within the TIR domain, explaining why it was not observed by SMART. Although the structure of TLR5 has not been solved, structures of human TLR1 and 2 TIR domains are available (Xu et al., 2000). Structural modelling of the TIR domain of P. alecto TLR5 based on the crystal structure of human TLR2 showed that the putative second TM domain corresponds to one of the central parallel \u03b2 sheets that form the hydrophobic core of the TIR domain (Fig. 4c).",

Each TLR is expected to contain one N terminal LRR domain and one C terminal LRR domain, flanking a variable number of regularly spaced LRR domains that form the ligand-binding region of these receptors. SMART was able to identify N terminal LRRs in TLRs 3 and 7 only and C terminal LRRs in TLRs 1\u201310 but not in TLR9. SMART also failed to detect a substantial proportion of the remaining LRRs, so structural modelling was performed to determine whether the number of LRRs could be predicted with greater accuracy (Fig. 5a\u2013d). Structural models of the ectodomains of P. alecto TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 were generated, based on the crystal structure of human TLR3 (Choe et al., 2005). This enabled the identification of additional LRR domains that were not detected by SMART. Mammalian TLR3 proteins typically have 25 LRR domains, whereas mammalian TLRs 7, 8 and 9 proteins typically have 27 LRRs (Matsushima et al., 2007). While SMART identified 20, 19, 18 and 19 LRR domains in P. alecto TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9, respectively, structural modelling enabled identification of 25 LRR domains in each case. In TLRs 7, 8 and 9, loops extending away from the main structure may contain additional LRR domains.",

Structural modelling enabled the identification of more LRR domains in P. alecto TLRs than homology searching using SMART, and the highest accuracy of LRR domain prediction appeared to be for P. alecto TLR3, due to the availability of the human TLR3 ectodomain structure, combined with the fact that P. alecto TLR3 is highly conserved. The predicted intron\u2013exon organisation of pteropid TLRs was found to be similar to that observed in other mammals, however varying numbers of 5\u2032 non-coding exons have been reported on occasion in some species. For example, bovine TLR1 is reported to have four non-coding 5\u2032 exons (Opsal et al., 2006) whereas only two were detected in P. alecto TLR1. The inability for automated gene assembly to detect many TLRs in the P. vampyrus genome, as well as significant miss-assemblies highlighted the need for laboratory confirmation of gene sequences mined from low-coverage genome assemblies.

Attempts to resolve the phylogenetic relationship of bats within this group in greater detail have produced varying results. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA placed bats within an existing subgroup of Laurasiatheria termed Fereuungulata (Carnivora + Perissodactyla + Cetartiodactyla) (Nikaido et al., 2000), whereas analysis of LINE-1 retrotransposon insertions argued against the existence of Fereuungulata as a natural grouping and instead suggested the creation of a new group termed Pegasoferae (Chiroptera + Perissodactyla + Carnivora + Pholidota) (Nishihara et al., 2006). Phylogenetic analysis of pteropid bat CD4, interferon-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b2 genes showed that they clustered within Laurasiatheria and were most closely related to sequences from pig, horse, cat and dog (Omatsu et al., 2006, Omatsu et al., 2008). The results of our phylogenetic analysis of P. alecto TLRs found that while bat TLRs 3 and 7 clustered with horse, cat and dog sequences, bat TLR8 was the least conserved sequence in Laurasiatheria, and bat TLR9 fell outside Laurasiatheria altogether. Despite this, the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 can be considered highly conserved in bats, consistent with them being capable of viral recognition similar to other species.",

Ka/Ks ratios <1 are interpreted as evidence of negative (purifying) selection pressure, meaning that evolution is selecting against mutations in that gene. In contrast, Ka/Ks ratios >1 (which are encountered much less frequently) are interpreted as evidence of positive selection, whereby mutations are favoured over conservative replication. Viruses and other parasites are under constant positive selection pressure to mutate in order to escape the immune responses of their host, and correspondingly some vertebrate immune genes are also under positive selection pressure in order to keep up in a so-called \u201cmolecular arms race\u201d (Nielsen et al., 2005). Analysis of the Ka/Ks ratio of P. alecto TLRs with other mammals suggested weak negative selection, supporting the findings of previous studies and consistent with selection to conserve important binding specificities (Roach et al., 2005, Nakajima et al., 2008, Barreiro et al., 2009).",

Analysis of P. alecto TLR5 using three predictive algorithms and three models of hydrophobicity predicted the presence of a second putative TM domain within the C terminal TIR domain. Structural modelling suggested that this region correlated with one of the parallel \u03b2 sheets located in the core of the TIR domain, however the model was based on the structure of human TLR2 (the TLR5 TIR domain structure has not been solved). The presence of this hydrophobic sequence may affect TLR5 signal transduction, and may suggest a functional region worthy of closer examination. The TM domain of P. alecto TLR9 was unable to be predicted by TMHMM, which is surprising as this method is reported to have a very low false negative prediction rate (Krogh et al., 2001), however using alternative methods we were able to identify a putative TM domain in P. alecto TLR9.",

Many questions remain about the functional significance of the TLR system in bats in relation to their role as carriers of zoonotic viruses. Unravelling the events that occur downstream of TLR signalling, such as induction of inflammatory cytokines and the potential for viruses to block TLR signalling pathways, depends firstly upon knowledge of which TLRs are present in the bat. It is hoped that this study fills that requirement and provides a prototype dataset that can be used to design functional assays. In summary, the fruit bat P. alecto appears to have a complement of TLRs resembling those present in humans and other mammals. It now remains to be determined whether the fruit bat TLR system functions the same or differently from other species during viral infections.",

P. alecto TLR13 is predicted to be a pseudogene due to the presence of three in-frame stop codons, as indicated by arrows. The figure is drawn to scale and distances are given in bp, however introns in TLRs 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 in the P. vampyrus genome assembly contained gaps so the actual sizes of these introns are estimates. The first exon of TLR5 was not represented in the P. vampyrus genome assembly and is therefore only assumed to be contiguous. Correspondingly, the first intron of TLR5 has been arbitrarily drawn at 1000 bp. In all other cases, intron\u2013exon boundaries were clearly identified by homology in other species, and by the presence of splice site consensus sequences.
