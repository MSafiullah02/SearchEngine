These investigations revealed that hematophagous animals have convergently recruited a series of molecules acting on different physiological stages of host hemostasis, including vasoconstriction, formation of both platelet plugs and fibrin clots and fibrinolysis [3, 5, 7, 9]. Platelet aggregation is the first stage of hemostasis, and is activated by collagen, thrombin, ADP and thromboxane A [9]. Secondary hemostasis, or blood coagulation cascade, consists of a series of enzymatic reaction where coagulation factors (inactive proenzymes) are converted in their active forms, generally proteases, that in turn activate the next proenzyme in the cascade, converging on a final common pathway concluded by thrombin that converts fibrinogen in fibrin clot. Generally speaking, hematophagous animals target the hemostatic system of the host at the level of both primary and secondary hemostasis, producing a number of proteins of different molecular masses, that act interacting with several targets and exert a variety of inhibitory mechanisms [3, 5, 7, 9].",

Neogastropoda include many familiar molluscs, such as cone snails (Conidae), purple dye snails (Muricidae), mud snails (Nassariidae), olive snails (Olividae), oyster drills (Muricidae), tulip shells (Fasciolariidae), and whelks (Buccinidae). The vast majority of neogastropods are carnivorous, with a degree of predatory activity that varies from actively seeking prey, scavenging, grazing on sessile invertebrates, or hematophagous parasitism. According to the fossil record, the adaptive radiation of neogastropods has been particularly rapid [17] and was accompanied by the diversification of their predatory lifestyles including a number of different trophic strategies. It has been thus hypothesized [17, 18] that evolutionary innovations related to the biochemistry of feeding were the main drivers of the rapid neogastropod radiation in the late Cretaceous, but such innovations have been investigated to date only in a few species of the venomous Conoidea [19-22].",

            "text": "The buccinoidean family Colubrariidae includes two dozen marine shallow-water species, probably all hematophagous, that inhabit rocky and coral environments in tropical, subtropical and temperate seas. At least six species (25 % of the family) have been documented in a parasitic association with different species of fish, mainly belonging to the family Scaridae [11, 23]. Both females and males are hematophagous: the blood meal is not related to any particular physiological state, and may occur at any time, although in nature is generally observed during the night time [11, 23]. The association is not species-specific, but seem to require a resting or slow moving fish (Modica & Oliverio, unpublished observation). Colubrariidae use a long and thin proboscis to feed on the blood of fishes [11, 23] (Modica & Oliverio, unpublished observation; Fig. 2). Specimens of the genus Colubraria Schumacher, 1817, which accounts for most of the species diversity of colubrariids, can extend their proboscis to a length exceeding three times the shell length. Initially, the extended proboscis contacts the skin of the prey, then, it gains access to the blood vessels of the fish. The radula is extremely minute in Colubraria, so that the genus was considered radula-less until very recently [15]. While a scraping action by such a reduced radula is still possible, the wounds observed in fishes seem to indicate the involvement of bioactive secretions (Fig. 2b). The snail then apparently takes advantage of the blood pressure of the fish to ingest its meal, congruently with the thin structure of the proboscis that is unlikely to exert an active suction [15]. Experimental observations on different Colubraria species (Modica and Oliverio, unpublished) suggest that adaptation to hematophagy involves the use of anesthetic and anticoagulant compounds. In fact, open wounds on the fish skin, often accompanied by bleeding, are evident on the fish skin after Colubraria detaching (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the fishes being fed on are generally resting and do not seem to be disturbed by the hematophagous activity of the colubrariid snail. It should be noted that anesthetization is reversible, as the fish usually recovers its full mobility in a few minutes after the snail disengages. This observation, indicating that the anaesthetic compounds used by the snail are not lethal to the prey, is in agreement with field observations that tropical colubrariids usually feed on fish sleeping in crevices of the reef (M. Oliverio unpublished observation, [11, 23]). Colubraria is a buccinoidean neogastropod, with some remarkable anatomical peculiarities, mainly regarding the structure of the anterior and mid-posterior oesophagous, described elsewhere for the type species C. muricata [15]. The anatomical structures responsible for anesthetic secretion have not been yet identified, however given the Colubrariidae foregut anatomy (Fig. 2e-f) anticoagulants are likely produced in the salivary glands. While the absence of accessory salivary glands, gland and valve of Leiblein are features quite common amongst buccinoideans [24-26], the glandularization of the posterior portion of the mid-oesophagous is a peculiar derived characteristic of colubrariids [15], worth of investigation since it may be related to the hematophagous lifestyle and it potentially shares some homology degrees with the toxoglossan venom glands [24-26].",

Most of the vWFA-like contigs possess a signal peptide and a stop codon, suggesting that they are complete and secreted proteins rather than fragments (Additional file 2: Figure S2). To better explore the similarities with human vWF domains, multidomain salivary proteins were split in domains that were aligned to human vWFA domains 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 6). Colubraria vWFA-like domains are considerably similar (pairwise identity 17-23 %; pairwise similarity 35-35 %) to domain A1 of the human vWF, which is responsible for binding platelet GpIb [43, 44]. Therefore, by competing with the vWF of their prey, they may bind thrombocytes preventing their interaction with collagen and thus inhibiting thrombocyte aggregation, with a resulting anti-hemostatic action. The alignment of Colubraria vWFA-like domains with human vWFA1 domain highlights the conservation of most residues responsible for platelet binding (Fig. 6), according to molecular studies of several von Willebrand disease phenotypes (reviewed in [44]) and to molecular modeling of the interaction with platelets [45, 46]. Moreover, several residues in vWFA1 domain were found mutated in Type IIB von Willebrand disease, resulting in an increased affinity for platelets [44]; interestingly, two of such gain-of-function mutations were observed in some of the Colubraria contigs (R543W or R543Q: [45, 47]; I546V: [48]). This observation suggests that the affinity for fish thrombocytes may be higher in Colubraria vWFA-like proteins than in native fish vWFA1.",

The latter is very similar to members of a hard-tick family of thrombin inhibitors that consist of pairs of Kunitz modules and include haemalin, amblin and boophilin [49, 55-57]. Although these molecules are only preliminarily characterized so far, a recent research highlighted their divergence from the antihemostatic factors identified in soft ticks (e.g. savigninin, monobin, ornithodorin) and evidenced their similarity to canonical Kunitz-type molecules such as BPTI [55]. The activity of haemalin, that is similar to contig comp105558_c0_seq3, was tested in vitro and resulted in the inhibition, even at low concentration, of plasma and fibrinogen clot, formation and platelet aggregation, indicating that haemalin is an anticoagulant for the common pathway of coagulation [49]. Boophilin, isolated from the whole body of Rhipicephalus microplus, is highly similar to haemalin, but it directly inhibits thrombin with a non-canonical mechanism, where a few N-terminal residues bind across the thrombin active-site cleft while C-terminal modules interact with the basic exosite I [57]. Amblin isolated from the haemolymph of Amblyomma hebraeum is quite different from other natural proteinase inhibitors, and its thrombin inhibitor activity still waits for an experimental confirmation [57, 58]. Although its activity remains to be tested in vitro, we can hypothesize that comp105558_c0_seq3 could act as a thrombin inhibitor in preventing blood clot formation to allow efficient feeding and digestion while passing through the oesophagus, as suggested for H. longicornis [49].",

In these species, the proposed activity for these molecules is the hydrolysis of adenosine, a molecule involved in pain perception [60, 65], thus reducing the perception of the parasite wound by the host. Additionally, the removal of adenosine produces inosine, a potent inhibitor of the production of inflammatory cytokines in vertebrates [61, 62]. Paradoxically, adenosine is also an immunosuppressive, vasodilatory and platelet aggregation inhibitor, and the presence of an enzyme that removes such a potentially useful molecule was explained in insects with the production of other more effective compounds counteracting these actions [60]. In C. reticulata, vasoconstriction apparently is not an issue, being instead advantageous to the parasite, while platelet aggregation can be counteracted by the action of ENPP5, Antigen-5 and vWFA-containing proteins.",

ACE also inactivates bradykinin, a vasodilator peptide, and thus contributes to blood pressure increase in mammals. In invertebrates, ACE-related genes have been cloned in a few insects [66-68], in the duck leech Theromyzon tessulatus [69], and recently ACE-encoding transcript was reported in the venom duct transcriptome of Conus victoriae [70], while the peptide was found in the proteomes of C. purpuranscens and C. ermineus [71]. For the cone snails it was suggested that the vasoconstrictory activity of ACE enzymes might play a role in envenomation, perhaps increasing the local concentration and effectiveness of the venom, or, more generally, interfering with cardiovascular homeostatic mechanisms as seen in other venomous animals. For a hematophagous feeder like Colubraria, ACE may play a role in the trophic physiology of the snail. In fact the proboscis in Colubraria is extremely thin and scarcely muscularized suggesting that it is not able to exert a strong suction [15]. Most likely, the passage of blood through the proboscis is due to the blood pressure of the fish, as confirmed by feeding observation (Oliverio & Modica, unpublished observations). In this context, increasing the blood pressure of the fish would maximize the blood income for Colubraria.",

However, after the detachment of the parasite the fish fully recovers without apparent damage. ShKT domain-containing proteins, which were found overexpressed in the snail salivary glands, are likely to take part in this reversible anesthetic action. ShK toxin is a potent inhibitor of voltage-gated and calcium-activated K+ channels. It has been hypothesized that, while ShK toxin per se is a potent blocker of ion channels in venomous animals, incorporation of the ShKT domain in other molecules (such as metalloproteases and serine proteases) may give rise to channel-modulatory enzymes [74]. K+ channels belong to the most abundant and diverse family of ion channels, and regulate a myriad of functions. Many venomous animal taxa have evolved potassium channel blockers, including cone snails and spiders [3, 51]. Several crucial differences may be highlighted in colubrarian transcripts with multiple ShKT domains: indeed, the number of cysteins may differ, as well as the conservation of key K/R residues, that have been considered crucial in the interaction with the K+ channel [73], may lack. However, the absence of these key residues in functionally active ShKT proteins was already described in snakes [75].",

Inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation has been recently reported for antigen-5 of the hematophagous Triatomine bugs Dipetalogaster maximus and Triatoma infestans, the vectors of Chagas disease [90, 91]. A recent study revealed that these proteins are Cu2+ antioxidant enzymes that are able to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation, ATP secretion and thromboxane-A production by a unique mechanism involving the removal of radical superoxide [92]. Moreover, scavenging of radical superoxide down-regulates a myriad of pro-inflammatory reaction, as it limits the production of inflammatory extracellular ROS by neutrophils, platelets and other cell types [92]. It can be hypothesized that antigen 5 protein could have the same activity in Colubraria, to reinforce anti-platelet-aggregation capabilities of the snail.",

Biological roles of the PS1 are extremely diverse, ranging from digestion to immune responses. The venom of several taxa of both vertebrates and invertebrates contains PS1 that are the dominant venom component in several species of cephalopods, in male platypuses, and in Remipedia [51, 96]. Activities of PS1 in the venom are diverse and are involved in pain, inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation and prevention of blood clotting. In Colubraria, members of PS1 family constitute only a reduced fraction of the salivary secretion, but include two well-differentiated putative proteins that may participate to the overall envenomation process, possibly exploiting an anticoagulant action. These proteins are the trypsin-like protein similar to cephalopods peptidases S1 and to echiurid fibrinolytic enzyme, and the chymotrypsin-like peptidase that is devoid of the conventional catalytic triad. Recent research identified in snake venoms a number of PS1 with unconventional catalytic triads that show activity towards a wide array of proteins involved in hemostasis, being able to degrade fibrinogen, fibrin, prothrombin, factor X and plasminogen [97].",

The molecular target of any framework IX-conopeptide has not been identified thus far. However, experimental evidences suggest, at least for some members of the P-subfamily, an action on glycine receptors [110], ligand-gated ion channels belonging to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family, which are important targets for neuroactive drugs [113]. Gly receptors are in fact widely distributed inhibitory receptors, that are involved in the regulation of the motor circuits of the spinal cord and have inhibitory synapses in afferent sensory neurons, including pain fibers [113, 114], being ideal targets for peripheral anesthetic compounds. The oesophageal overexpression of turritoxin-like contig comp109534_c9_seq2 is in agreement with the structural homology of Conoidean venom duct with the colubrarian mid-oesophagus [26]. The expression of other families of conopeptides in salivary glands was reported for Conus pulicarius [115], but no conopeptides were found in a recent transcriptome of salivary glands of C. geographus [20]. Expression of turritoxins does not appear to be restricted to gastropods, as it was also recently detected in the venom of the polychaete Glycera [75].",

Anticoagulant activities in the saliva, which is secreted both into the prey and along the extremely long anterior oesophagus, can be ascribed to the synergic action of several molecules, with a crucial role possibly played by the vWFA domain-containing proteins, encoded by numerous contigs overexpressed at the highest levels in the salivary subset. The mid-oesophageal transcriptome is apparently less complex than the salivary one and is dominated by transcripts encoding for a turritoxin-like protein and for a two Kunitz-domains protease inhibitor",

We hypothesize that the mid-oesophageal turritoxin is produced when the snail approaches the fish and, as in the case of the venomous cocktail of Conus geographus, it may be involved in the induction of a \u201chypnotic\u201d state in the fish. C. geographus, as other so called net-hunter cone snails, engulfs fish (or even a small school of fishes) with its highly extensible rostrum before stinging. Apparently, when the fish is approached by a cone snail, it remains in an almost hypnotic state until the snail is close enough to engulf it [22] displaying a behavior extremely similar to Colubraria predatory activity. The biochemistry of the induction of \u201chypnosis\u201d has not been investigated to date in Conus. In Colubraria the use of an oesophageal secretion in the external environment could be possible due to the loss of the valve of Leiblein, a structure that in neogastropod separates the mid from the anterior oesophagus and thus from the environment [15, 26].",

First, when the proboscis contacts the fish, the snail has to gain access to the blood. The massive secretion of porins, maybe assisted by the metalloproteases, probably elicit a potent cytolytic activity [79, 106], that associated with the scraping action of the radula allows the snail to open large circular wounds on the fish skin (Fig. 2B). Unquestionably, an anesthetic activity is crucial to efficiently accomplish blood-feeding in any hematophagous taxa. In Colubraria this anesthetic activity is likely due to the concerted activity of ShKT-containing proteins, especially the CAP-ShKT that act as K channel modulators [78], and ADA, that may reduce local pain perception by removing adenosine [60]. The anticoagulant action at the site of the wound and in the anterior digestive tract is mediated by the salivary production of a complex mixture of anticoagulant compounds. The vWFA-containing proteins, novel proteins here described for the first time, may act as platelet anti-aggregants and target primary hemostasis, throughout a mechanism still to be defined but probably including direct scavenging of thrombocytes. Anti-platelet activity can be assisted by the Antigen-5 protein, via a radical superoxide removal mechanism [92]. ENPP5 can participate to disarrange primary hemostasis, producing Ap4A that reinforce the inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation [100]. Secondary hemostasis may be targeted by the 4 Kunitz domain protein, similar to the tick Rhipicephalus pulchellus Tetralaris, a potent thrombin and TF/FVIIa complex inhibitor [52, 54], and to TFPI, that modulates factor Xa. Astacins and peptidases S1 also likely contribute to impair hemostasis, as described e.g. in snakes and spiders, due to the fibrinogenolytic activity of astacins [79], and to the hemorrhagic\u2013anticoagulant activity of PS1 that involves the degradation of several hemostatic factors [97]. Finally, salivary glands produce ACE that owing to its vasopressive activity can increase cardiac frequency in the fish and maximize blood income through the snail foregut, considerably reducing Colubraria feeding time. Vasoconstriction is a defense mechanism that is part of the hemostatic system, and is generally counteracted by hematophagous animals; interestingly, in a \u201cpassive feeder\u201d such as Colubraria it becomes advantageous to the parasite, explaining the recruitment of ACE enzyme in the venomous cocktail.",

Primary hemostasis is targeted by several molecules produced in different hematophagous species, that act at various stages, including salivary apyrases, epinephrine and serotonine binding molecules and nitrophorins in several arthropods; lipocalins in Rhodnius prolixus, triatomines and ticks; collagen binding proteins as antiplatelets in mosquitos and leeches; integrin antagonists in ticks and hookworms [6]. Inhibitors of secondary hemostasis are extremely variable as well, in their molecular masses, targets and inhibitory mechanisms, with thrombin and FXa being the most common targets [5, 7].",

The evolution of such arsenal could have been triggered by the high efficiency of the coagulation system in fishes that need to rapidly repair vascular damage, especially in the gills, where blood supply is maximum and very close to the external environment. In fact, although hemostasis in fish involves the same mechanisms and factors described in mammals (except for the presence in fish of nucleated thrombocytes instead of anucleated platelets), coagulation time is generally shorter, due to the high levels of coagulation factors contributing to high activity of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway [116]. Further molecular and biochemical studies on the anticoagulant secretions of other hematophagous parasites of fishes, such as fish lice and lampreys, could elucidate mechanisms of evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d between fishes and their parasites.",
