Peptides derived from the N-protein, were synthesised and conjugated with EDANS and DABCYL for FRET analysis. The FRET-labelled peptide substrates were incubated with N-protein, trypsin (positive control), or buffer (negative control). In this assay peptide cleavage would result in the liberation of EDANS and DABCYL and a concomitant increase in fluorescence [25]. In positive controls, incubation of both FRET substrates with trypsin resulted in increased fluorescence and demonstrated that the assay could detect proteases. However, in N-protein trials, no similar increase in fluorescence was seen (Fig. 4\n) indicating that contaminating proteases were unlikely unless in amounts below the detection limit of the assay (for trypsin, approximately 2.5 ng/ml). SARS N-protein present in the same mixture as these SR-containing substrates did, itself, undergo cleavage as evidenced by the appearance of A and B bands on SDS\u2013PAGE (data not shown), indicating that if the N-protein is responsible for its own cleavage (autolysis), it is unable to cleave FRET-labelled peptides containing the cleavage site. These data can be explained if the sequences for protease binding and subsequent cleavage are located in different regions of the N-protein. Separation of binding and cleavage sites on a proteolytic substrate has been reported previously [26] but it is not common for a protease to bind a substrate at a sequence remote from the scissile bond. Taken together, the results from the FITC-labelled casein, the refolding, and the FRET (EDANS/DABCYL) detection experiments strongly suggest that the SR-specific cleavage of N-protein is not the result of a contaminating protease activity.",

Ying and co-workers [24] observed three N-protein-related bands with apparent molecular size of 27\u201331 kDa and four at 16\u201323 kDa in addition to bands for the full-length protein. This hydrolysis attributed to the action of endogenous caspase-3 as N-protein incubation with exogenous caspases, resulted in similar cleavage products. The authors did not note that the SARS N-protein sequence lacks the canonical\u2014DXXD\u2014caspase-3 cleavage site. More recently, Diemer et al. [27] showed that caspase-6 can cleave SARS N-protein following residue 400 or 403, giving fragments of 44 and 2 kDa. The cleavage was cell-type specific and only observed in Vero-E6 or human epithelial and not Caco or N2a (murine neuronal) lines. In the current study, SDS\u2013PAGE results using E. coli-derived SARS N-protein showed similar cleavage to that detected by Ying et al., but in the absence of any caspases.",

Guruprasad and co-workers [28] report that certain dipeptide sequences are statistically more likely to be found in proteins with shorter in vivo half-lives than in those with longer in vivo half-lives. Both SR and RS (arginine\u2013serine) dipeptides (and the N-protein SR-rich region contains both) are among those found more frequently in \u201cunstable\u201d proteins. In vivo instability is usually linked to digestion by circulating or cellular proteases. Therefore, a database of proteases was searched to find an enzyme capable of the observed cleavages. Not only is the SR motif cleavage site is not a recognition site for any known E. coli proteases (consistent with our inability to detect protease contamination in our N-protein preparations), it is not recognized by any other protease in the database [29]. Several proteases do cleave following positively charged residues, including arginine (Arg-C and clostripain) or any arginine or lysine (trypsin); however, this cleavage is otherwise non-specific and does not require S in the P2 position.",

            "text": "The putative biological role(s) of this SR-rich region is not completely known, but it has been proposed that this region allows the SARS N-protein to form the dimers or tetramers [13], [17] thought to be essential in formation of the mature viral nucleocapsid and aiding in compacting the RNA/nucleocapsid complex [13], [14], [15], [30]. Deletion of the SR-rich region not only completely abolished the oligimerization of the N-protein but also resulted in a disordered distribution of N-proteins in mammalian cells [17]. Considering that the region responsible for self-association identified by these previous studies was identical to the cleavage region identified in this study, it is reasonable to speculate that the cleavage of this sequence may aid in the unpacking of viral RNA needed to allow this RNA to serve as a template for viral genome replication. If binding and subsequent lysis of the SR-rich amino acid region are inherent properties of the SARS N-protein, the SR-rich amino acid sequence presents a potential target for a SARS therapeutic and an agent that prevents its cleavage (perhaps a competitive inhibitor such as a mimetic of the SR-region) may prove effective in interrupting viral replication in SARS-infected individuals.",
