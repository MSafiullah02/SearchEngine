The majority of patients have respiratory symptoms. Laboratory examination shows that the absolute number of leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes decrease in most patients, while CRP increases significantly and procalcitonin is usually normal [7]. The main manifestations on CT are patchy/punctate ground glass opacities with a single lobe or multiple lobes involvement [8]. However, in our case, leukocytes, ratio of neutrophils and lymphocytes remains normal. These differences can be attributed to the relatively mild symptoms of patient.",

Meanwhile some critical residues in 2019 nCoV receptor-binding motif (RBM) also provide favorable interactions with ACE2 receptor in human cells [9]. Some researcher searched NCBI's open database and found that ACE2 receptor was highly expressed in the human small intestine, mainly in proximal and distal enterocytes. Studies showed that ACE2 receptor can control intestinal inflammation and diarrhea, so the virus may induce diarrhea by binding to ACE2 receptor, interfering with its normal function [5], [10]. Interestingly, although differences in RBD regions between SARS-CoV and 2019 nCoV do not significantly affect their ability to bind to ACE2 receptors, they have a significant impact on cross-reactivity of antibody, causing some antibodies that can bind SARS CoV to fail to bind 2019nCoV [11].",

This was a quite low rate compared with SARS, which reported to be 20-25% [12], and the mechanism remained unknown. Wan's research showed that 2019 nCoV recognizes human ACE2 less efficient than human SARS-CoV (year 2002), but more efficient than human SARS-CoV (year 2003) [9]. Different affinity with ACE2 receptor may lead to significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea, but more data is needed to explore and confirm this.",
