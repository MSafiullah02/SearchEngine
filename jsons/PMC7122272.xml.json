            "text": "This chapter focuses on the use of antioxidant liposomes in the general area of free radical biology and medicine. The term antioxidant liposome is relatively new and refers to liposomes containing lipid-soluble chemical antioxidants, water-soluble chemical antioxidants, enzymatic antioxidants, or combinations of these various antioxidants. The role of antioxidants in health and disease has been extensively discussed, and many excellent reviews and books are available (1\u20133). Antioxidant liposomes hold great promise in the treatment of many diseases in which oxidative stress plays a prominent role. Oxidative stress is a physiological condition in which the production of damaging free radicals exceeds the in vivo capacity of antioxidant protection mechanisms to prevent pathophysiology. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons, often highly reactive and damaging to biological systems. The biological membranes of subcellular organelles are a major site of free radical damage but proteins and DNA are also significant targets. Moreover, free radicals can alter cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Oxygen radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the single electron reductions of oxygen. \n1\n",

Moreover, ONOO\u2212 is likely to be generated during inflammation and the killing of bacteria. Free radicals are generated in both the aqueous and lipid compartments of cells and, to minimize their damaging effects, requires both lipid- and water-soluble antioxidants.

Antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and \u03b1-tocopherol have also been used to prevent the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid moieties in the phospholipids of liposomes during storage (14) or sonication (15). This chapter, however, focuses on the potential therapeutic uses of antioxidant liposomes. This is a rapidly evolving area of medical research not extensively reviewed. Most of the research to date has been accomplished using in vitro cell culture systems or animal models. Very few clinical trials have been attempted, yet obvious medical situations exist (as discussed later) in which antioxidant liposomes have enormous health-related significance. The preparation of antioxidant liposomes that can be targeted to specific sites in the body is also a promising area but awaits further research. Most chemical antioxidants are phytoceuticals whose properties have already been extensively studied and are generally regarded as nontoxic and safe for human consumption (1). In the following subheadings, we first review the varieties of antioxidants that have either been used in antioxidant liposomes or hold the promise of such utilization. We then focus on issues relating to the modes of administration and lastly describe the clinical uses of antioxidant liposomes for diseases in which oxidative stress plays a major role. Major emphasis is placed on the use of antioxidant liposomes for pulmonary diseases.",

Tocopherols can readily be incorporated into both monolayers of unilamellar liposomes in a monomeric form (16). Furthermore, tocopherol in liposomes can undergo spontaneous intermembrane transfer to an acceptor membrane without the fusion of the tocopherol liposome (16). This intermembrane transfer is more pronounced when the tocopherol liposome contains polyunsaturated fatty acids (16). R,R,R-\u03b1-tocopherol and R,R,R-\u03b1-tocotrienol are forms of vitamin E that have the same aromatic chromanol head group but differ in the structure of their hydrocarbon tails. R,R,R-\u03b1-tocotrienol is, however, a better peroxyl radical scavenger than R,R,R-\u03b1-tocopherol in phosphatidylcholine liposomes (26).",

Dihydrolipoic acid is somewhat unique because it can quench peroxyl radicals generated both in the aqueous phase and in membranes (34). Chemical antioxidants generally act by donating an electron to a free radical (thereby quenching the free radical) or by serving as a substrate for an antioxidant enzyme. Glutathione, for example, is itself an antioxidant (6) and can also function as a substrate for glutathione peroxidase, a key (selenium containing) antioxidant enzyme that converts lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) or H2O2 into the corresponding lipid alcohols (LOHs) or H2O. Chemical antioxidants can also be chelators of transition metal ions that catalyze lipid peroxidation reactions. Urate, which is present at very high concentrations in human plasma, is an excellent antioxidant that can both chelate transition metal ions and also quench aqueous free radicals (35). Recently, we have observed 50\u201360% protection by N-acetylcysteine in the generation of free radicals in lungs by mustard gas induced lung injury in guinea pigs (Das and coworkers unpublished observations).",

Turrens has reviewed the potential of antioxidant enzymes as in vivo pharmacological agents (36). The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to antioxidant enzymes increases their in vivo half-lives and their effectiveness in preventing pulmonary oxygen toxicity in rats (37). The various procedures for preparing liposomes with entrapped antioxidant enzymes have been evaluated by Aoki et al. (38).

The intravenous use of antioxidant liposomes has the potential for rapidly increasing the plasma and tissue concentration of antioxidants far beyond what oral administration could achieve. Moreover, the proteolytic and bioselective processes of the gastrointestinal tract do not limit the types of antioxidants that can be administered via intravenous antioxidant liposomes. For example, it is known that plasma levels of \u03b1-tocopherol are about 10 times higher than the levels of \u03b3-tocopherol despite the fact that dietary levels of \u03b3-tocopherol are at least two times that of \u03b1-tocopherol. Nevertheless, \u03b3-tocopherol has a unique chemical ability to detoxify peroxynitrite that is not shared with \u03b1-tocopherol (43). Peroxynitrite is a powerful oxidant formed by the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide radicals (see\nEq. 5) and may be an important mediator of acute oxidant tissue damage. It is reasonable to suspect, therefore, that medical situations could arise in which it would be desirable to rapidly increase plasma (and tissue) levels of \u03b3-tocopherol. The poor bioavailability of orally administered \u03b3-tocopherol makes this very difficult to accomplish. This limitation could, however, be overcome by the intravenous administration of liposomes containing \u03b3-tocopherol.",

This group found that \u03b2-carotene liposomes injected into the oral squamous cell carcinoma of the hamster caused a lysis of the tumor cells but not of normal cells (54). Retinoids have also been shown to be clinically effective in treating diverse premalignant and malignant conditions such as cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, leukoplakia, squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, and basal cell carcinomas (55,56). Several investigators have documented dramatic improvement in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia after treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (57-59). However, the side effects of oral all-trans-retinoic acid therapy are similar to effects seen with vitamin A: headaches, other central nervous system problems, and dryness of mucosal tissues, erythema, and desquamation of skin. When incorporated in liposomes, all-trans-retinoic acid-associated toxicity is markedly reduced whereas antitumor properties, that is, growth inhibition and differentiation induction of all-trans retinoic acid are maintained or even enhanced (60,61). Phase I and phase II clinical studies found that plasma levels of all-trans-retinoic acid were maintained at high concentrations even after prolonged treatment of patients with all-trans-retinoic acid-liposomes (62). In general, the use of retinoids is safe and induces complete remission in 80\u201390% of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. However, chronic oral administration results in reduced plasma levels associated with disease relapse in the majority of patients; this can be circumvented by using all-trans-retinoic acid liposomes.",

Surfactant is necessary to maintain proper expansion of the small air sacs in the lung. If surfactant levels are low, the small air sacs in the lungs collapse resulting in poor oxygen delivery (hypoxia) to tissues. Infants deficient in surfactant therefore require treatment with high levels of oxygen to prevent damage to their vital organs. Unfortunately, premature infants are often deficient in antioxidants that are necessary to protect organs from injury caused by high concentrations of oxygen. The combination of surfactant deficiency and the presence of oxygen free radicals promote the development of chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD). BPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. An estimated 50% of all neonatal deaths result from BPD or its complications. In the adult form of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine are recognized for their role in reducing the duration of acute lung injury (75,76). The rationale for using antioxidant liposomes to treat respiratory distress in premature infants or adults is certainly compelling and supported by the animal models detailed below. However, almost no clinical trials have been initiated.",

These authors point out that the delivery of drugs to the lung via liposomes is particularly useful because it can minimize extrapulmonary side effects and potentially result in increased drug retention time. In addition (as discussed previously), liposomes for delivery by inhalation or instillation can encapsulate enzyme and/or chemical substances that cannot be delivered by an oral route. Smith and Anderson (78) demonstrated that intratracheally administered liposomes (with phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and stearylamine) have a long retention time (> 5 d) in the mouse lung. Liposomes with entrapped Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase and catalase (Cu,ZnSOD+CAT liposomes) were intratracheally instilled in rabbits and the alveolar distribution of the antioxidants measured after 4 and 24 hours (79). The results indicate that Cu,ZnSOD+CAT liposomes could increase both SOD and CAT activities in distal lung cells, including alveolar type I, alveolar type II cells, and macrophages. More recent studies by Walther et al. (80) have shown that intratracheal administration of CuZn\u2212CAT liposomes to premature rabbits can increase the lung SOD activity and protect against hyperoxic lung injury. Moreover, intratracheal delivery of SOD liposomes or CAT liposomes does not down-regulate mRNA synthesis of these enzymes in the premature rabbit lung (81).",

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) has often been used to induce neutrophil-mediated lung injury in animal models. It is significant, therefore, that liposomes (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) with \u03b1-tocopherol are able to counteract some PM\u03b1-induced lung injury in a rat model (91). In contrast, rats pretreated with blank liposomes (no \u03b1-tocopherol) showed no protection from PM\u03b1-induced lung injury (91).",

Suntres and Shek (4) have compared the ability of \u03b1-tocopherol liposomes (TOH liposome) or liposomes with both \u03b1-tocopherol and glutathione (TOH+GSH liposome) to inhibit paraquat-induced lung damage in a rat model. Lung damage was assessed by increases in lung weight (caused by edema) and decreases in lung activities of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) that reflects damage to endothelial and alveolar type II epithelial cells. These investigators found that both TOH liposomes and TOH+GSH liposomes were equally effective in preventing loss of lung ACE activity but that TOH+GSH liposomes were more effective in preventing injury to alveolar type II epithelial cells (4). Interestingly, neither antioxidant liposome was effective in preventing lung edema (4).",

Liposomes encapsulated with superoxide dismutase (SOD liposomes) or with lower levels of CAT (50 U or 70 U) did not prevent the chronic lung changes.
