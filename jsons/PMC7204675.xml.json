In their dataset of 1,151 patients who were mechanically ventilated, 3% were discharged alive, 25% had died, and 72% were still in the ICU(8). Therefore we can estimate the mortality is somewhere between 25% and 97%. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Center in the United Kingdom documented a lower mortality rate when including non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. In their population, patients who required advanced respiratory support, inclusive of BIPAP, CPAP and mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal respiratory support, 67% were dead at the end of their critical care stay(13). Caution is warranted when looking at these data as they are biased towards reporting patient outcomes of those who died or recovered quickly, and may underreport those with a long duration of mechanical ventilation.",
