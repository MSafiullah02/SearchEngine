In vivo systems, which involve the whole animal provides the most natural experimental conditions. However, the in vivo systems have many unknown and uncontrollable interactions that add ambiguity to the interpretation of empirical data. The study of the immune system in vertebrates requires a suitable animal model. For most basic research in immunology, mice have been the experimental animal of choice. To control experimental variation caused by differences in the genetic background of experimental animals, immunologists work with inbred or knock-out or knock-in strains that are genetically identical animals produced by inbreeding. Hundreds of different strains of mice are available these days, e.g. CBA, BALB, C57BL/6, etc.",

This feature enables relating any damage that appears in the course of an infection to host immune responses against the virus. Another important feature of the LCMV model system is the existence of several well-characterized viral strains that differ in their replicative capacity, host range (cell tropism and mouse strain) and experimental routes of infection (intracranial versus intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intravenous (i.v.)) and thus show different infection outcomes. This enables directly linking easily measurable viral dynamic properties to pathogenic consequences and studying the kinetic mechanisms of chronic infections.",

            "text": "With the use of the LCMV infection model system, a large number of conceptual discoveries in immunology have been made, which are as follows:back in 1974/75, Zinkernagel and Doherty demonstrated that cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize foreign antigens only in the context of proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [5, 6]. For this finding of MHC restriction, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1996.with the help of knockout mice, the mechanism of CTL-mediated destruction of LCMV-infected target cells in vivo was directly linked to perforin, a pore-forming protein contained in granules of this cell type [7, 8].fundamental properties of \u2018memory\u2019 of the adaptive immune response have been understood, in particular, the requirements for CTL memory to prevent the establishment of a persistent LCMV infection [9].NK cells of the innate immune response have been recognized as an important regulator of the helper T-cell support for antiviral CTL [10].a critical role of organized secondary lymphoid organs in the induction of naive T and B cells and subsequent virus control was established [11].the concept of immunopathology, that is the damage of tissues and organs due to the antiviral immune response rather than the infecting virus itself, was established. Mediators of immunopathology include CTL, macrophages, neutrophils and interferons [12\u201314].based on the amino acid similarities between viral antigens and host proteins, the so-called molecular mimicry, viral infections can trigger autoimmunity and influence the course of subsequent infections with other viral pathogens [15\u201317].important observations towards an acute versus a persistent infection outcomes were made as shown in Fig. 4.1 [18\u201321].\n\n",

As CTL exhaustion can be reversed by antibodies against PD1 or PD-L1 that block the negative signalling pathway, novel immunotherapeutic modalities arose which show exciting promises as antiviral and anticancer therapies [22\u201324].",

The mathematical model of antiviral CTL response developed previously [1] is based upon assumptions reflecting general mechanisms of the virus\u2013host interaction: (i) virus-specific CTLs are primarily responsible for control of infection with non-cytopathic viruses; (ii) the virus population stimulates clonal expansion and differentiation of the specific CTL precursors (CTLp) into effector cells; (iii) a high viral load leads eventually to inhibition of CTL responses via anergy and activation-induced cell death by apoptosis; (iv) in the absence of viral antigens the homeostasis of naive CTLs reflects a balance between the input of the precursor CTLs from thymus and their death at the periphery; (v) virus replication in the host exhibits a logistic-type growth, whereas the elimination follows a second-order kinetics.

Hence, the stability is always determined by a finite number of roots. The rightmost (stability determining) characteristic roots are approximated using a linear multi-step method applied to variational equation (4.8), see [34\u201336] for details. A steplength heuristic is implemented to ensure accurate approximations of the roots with real part greater than a given constant. The approximations thus obtained are corrected using a Newton iteration on the characteristic equation.",

The stability of the steady state can change during continuation whenever characteristic roots cross the imaginary axis. Generically a fold bifurcation (or turning point) occurs when a real characteristic root passes through zero and a Hopf bifurcation occurs when a pair of complex conjugate characteristic roots crosses the imaginary axis. Once a Hopf point is detected it can be followed in a two-parameter space using an appropriate determining system [34].

The extent of reduction needed depends on the responder status of the host, in particular, the lifespan of CTL memory subsets, duration of CTL division cycle, activation thresholds of CTL for proliferation, and differentiation. Since the virus remains the same during acute and persistence phase (it should not acquire attenuating mutations) we propose that the reduction in LCMV replication rate resulting in the low-level persistence could be either due to changes in the host cells, e.g. mediated by type I interferons, or intrinsic features of the virus replicatory cycle [39], which slow down the virus growth.

This depends on the extent of virus distribution in peripheral tissues as well as the relative kinetics of the CTL response and is an important determinant of the outcome of infection. Virus-induced CTL responses represent heterogeneous populations of cells in different activation and differentiation states: activated cycling, cytolytic effector and quiescent memory cells. These subsets differ essentially in their function and ability to migrate to peripheral sites of infection. Because LCMV is non-cytopathic, virus clearance from the host through CTL-mediated perforin-dependent destruction of infected cells is always associated with a varying degree of immunopathology. Under small infectious doses virus replication is localized mainly to the spleen so that virus-triggered CTL-dependent destruction of infected antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) is manifested as acquired immune suppression [48, 49]. Large doses of systemic or any peripheral infections lead to a wider spread of the virus in the host and can induce other types of immunopathology, depending on the tissue damage involved (e.g. choriomeningitis). The type of pathology in natural and experimental systems depends onthe route of infection (intravenous, intracerebral, intrahepatic, etc.),tissue tropism of the virus,the dose of infection andimmune status of the host.\n",

Reliable input from experimental or clinical research in terms of precise and comprehensive data sets is a core part of an interdisciplinary modelling approach. The data set for model-driven analysis was generated using established protocols [55, 63]. Briefly, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers complexed with the immunodominant CTL epitope (gp33) derived from the glycoprotein of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-GP) were used to follow activation of gp33-specific CTLs after immunization with DC. DCs derived from transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the first 60aa of LCMV-GP including gp33 (H8-DC) were injected intravenously into naive C57BL/6 recipient mice. At the specific time points following immunization, the densities of the following cell populations as a function of time t were determined:Activated CD8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^+$$\\end{document} 62L\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^-$$\\end{document} T-cells staining with the gp33-tetramer (tet+) in spleenQuiescent CD8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^+$$\\end{document}CD62L\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^+$$\\end{document}tet\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^+$$\\end{document} cells in spleen \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$E_m(t)$$\\end{document};The availability of adoptively transferred DC for productive interaction with T-cells within secondary lymphoid organs was quantified.

A critical feature for the systemic response is that CTL transfer rates from spleen to blood appear to be DC-density dependent. To describe the observed CTL kinetics, one needs to consider the possibility of the DC-dependent retention of T cells. Thus, the model predicts a trapping effect, which reduces the export rate of CTLs to blood by about tenfold above a threshold of about 10 H8-DCs present in the spleen and equally applies to quiescent and activated CTL.

This allows one to quantify the individual decay rates, the virus\u2013target cell interaction parameters and the protective effect of IFN-I.
