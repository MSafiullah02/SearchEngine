Assessment of thought and mood is contingent upon the understanding we derive from the Gestalt view of the whole person in front of us (Martin, 1990) . Patients in turn present with a broad range of social communication difficultieswhile individuals with schizophrenia may not be able to read emotions very well and thus perceive threat easily, persons with depression may not say much, but the face will reveal a depressed affect. In contrast, for someone who has gone through trauma, a trustworthy and empathic face of the psychiatrist and appropriate verbal messages breaks the barrier.

In parallel to motoric and proprioceptive contributions to ataxia, socio-emotive incoordination (difficulties in expressing and perceiving emotions and mental states in others) can involve expressive and receptive components. For instance, access to a select set of non-verbal cues (i.e. expression of emotions exclusively through eyes) as well as altered verbal communication (muffled voice) can potentially breed ambiguity and hence accentuate biased inference of other\"s mental state in both the psychiatrist and the patient. Indeed, veiled faces have been shown to bias the perceptual inference toward more negative and less positive emotions (Fischer et al., 2012) . Moreover, wearing a face-mask can alter the sensory feedback of the motoric gesture as we communicate. We may hear our voices as muffled, or may not be able to make the full range of facial expressions. Studies from individuals receiving botulinum toxin treatment of the facial musculature (and impaired feedback systems thereof) report facial emotion recognition difficulties, based on the theory of embodied emotions (Lewis, 2018) . Together, these receptive and expressive impairments can critically impair efficient social reciprocity, which is rooted in moment-to-moment appraisals of social cues within a transactional framework between two individuals.",

Therefore, psychiatrists may need to learn new ways of communicating and assessing emotions during clinical encounters. To begin with, making the patient and the mental health professional wear transparent masks will overcome not only challenges posed by visual sensory deprivation but also help us interpret what the other person is speaking more efficiently (Atcherson et al., 2017) . Using the eyes, eyebrows, hand gestures and appropriate body posture to more effectively communicate will help to improve the patient\"s comprehension of what we want to communicate. Taking time to understand the information in its entirety and then responding or moving ahead in the conversation will enable tapping into the mentalizing brain and facilitate better interpretation of the patient\"s mental state. Having fewer mental health professionals communicating with the patient (preferably one-toone) so that the patient does not have to switch between team members and understand different levels of muffling voices. When appropriate, harnessing digital technology-based virtual assessments or electronic expressions (emojis) may circumvent some of the challenges. Undergoing training from speech and language therapists specifically to use the right intonation and prosody to speak clearly through a mask may yield additional benefits.",

Nonetheless, the bottom line is that a clinician-patient relationship is built on mutual trust and a warm and caring environment beyond the interview room. Taking adequate steps to ensure this environment will also go a long way in overcoming this unique challenge we are faced with today. To surmise, the \"obstacle\" of the \"mask\" may very well be the \"path\" to re-discover the value of \"personalized, empathic communication\" which, unfortunately, has been gradually fading in contemporary psychiatry.",
