Hence, it is extremely important that we develop resources and tools that can be used to parse out useful information from free-text written in any language. In this paper, we investigated whether the standard insights extraction pipeline is sufficient when applied to a single language family indigenous to Africa, Bantu languages, using the following questions: (1) how well does the standard insights extraction pipeline apply to Bantu languages; and (2) if found to be inadequate, why, and how can the pipeline be modified so as to be applicable to Bantu languages?",

Bantu languages have an agglutinating morphology, where words consist of several morphemes, and each affix agglutinated with the root word carries meaning such as tense and aspect [21]. The writing system of Bantu languages is either conjunctive or disjunctive [25]. In the former case, several orthographic words, \u2018I love them\u2019, are written as a single word, for example, Mbakunda in Runyankore (a language indigenous to Uganda). The latter case writes different orthographic words as separate words. For example, the same translation for \u2018I love them\u2019 is Kea ba rata in Sepedi (a language indigenous to South Africa).",

A simple noun comprises a prefix and a stem [11]; for example, omuntu, \u2018person\u2019 in Runyankore, can be analyzed as the prefix o-mu- and stem -ntu. However, not all Bantu languages have the initial vowel on the prefix [11, 17]; for example, \u2018person\u2019 in Sepedi is motho, with prefix mo- and stem -tho. Noun classes are also at the heart of an extensive system of concordial agreement that governs grammatical agreement in verbs, adjectives, possessives, subject, object, etc. [11, 25]; this is a pivotal constituent of the whole Bantu sentence structure [25].",

The scope here is limited to social media data, specifically textual data, and more so, Twitter data, because the vast amount of content generated and shared through social media contains rich knowledge and covers a wide spectrum of social dynamics [33]. In their socio-semantic analysis of Twitter data, Lipizzi et al. [15] stated that the following processes are necessary to extract complete and valuable insights from data: (1) preprocessing the text, (2) identifying and classifying opinions in the network, (3) analyzing the sentiment of individual or groups of text, (4) visualization of the large amounts of data; and (5) extracting conversational maps from social streams.

Because text documents are high dimensional objects, effectively visualizing such data requires it to be projected to a lower-dimensional space [18]. Thus, dimensionality reduction, which involves transforming high-dimensional data into a meaningful representation of reduced dimensionality, is an essential part of text mining [6, 31]. However, for the lower dimensional representation to be meaningful, it must be a good approximation of the original document set given in its full space [6]. The commonly used techniques for dimensionality reduction are: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which both minimizes information loss and increases interpretability [6, 10]; Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a stable and robust technique [9]; and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), which is particularly well suited for the visualization of high dimensional datasets [30].",

The live tweets were archived based on the trending hashtags during the period of data collection. The six Bantu languages targeted were IsiZulu, Luganda, Runyankore, Sepedi, Sesotho, and Setswana.

The mixed Bantu language dataset comprised three conjunctively written languages (isiZulu, Luganda, and Runyankore) and three disjunctively written languages (Sepedi, Sesotho, and Setswana). As explained in Sect. 2, Bantu languages are written either conjunctively or disjunctively, and therefore, there is a need to differentiate between them in order to perform the appropriate preprocessing. Taljard and Bosch [25] identified that a word-class tagger is sufficient for disjunctively written languages, while a morphological analyzer is required for the conjunctively written languages. This is because the disjunctive system of writing requires bound morphemes to be written as orthographically distinct units (Kea ba rata \u2018I love them\u2019 in Sepedi), thus making morphological information explicit in the orthography [25]. On the other hand, the conjunctive writing style requires a morphological analyzer to make the different morphemes in the orthography explicit [25], for example from Mbakunda to m-ba-kunda \u2018I love them\u2019 in Runyankore. The authors concluded that the differences in writing systems necessitate the use of different architectures specifically for part-of-speech tagging. The need for part-of-speech tagging was identified as crucial during text preprocessing and therefore, the type of writing style first needs to be identified before this can be performed.",

While this difference is not significant, we emphasize the agglutinative structure of Bantu languages presented in Sect. 2, where a word consists of several morphemes, and each affix agglutinated with the root word carries meaning such as subject, object, tense, aspect, negation, etc. [21]. As a result, for the conjunctive writing style, an entire sentence can be represented as a single word.

From measuring the number of tokens below the recommended threshold count of three in both datasets, we found that 72.04% of tokens in the mixed Bantu language dataset were below this threshold, compared to 0.00% in the English dataset.

Losing such morphemes would in turn skew the results on sentiment analysis further down the pipeline.",

Further, it is performed after part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis, in order to avoid the ambiguity of the negation morpheme identified for some disjunctively written languages, while also making the negation morpheme explicit for conjunctively written languages.Finally, during topic modeling, without stemming verbs and adjectives, the threshold counts should not be applied because a significant amount of the dataset will be excluded.\n",

Seven processes were identified as belonging to the standard pipeline (text preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, visualization, clustering, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and network graphing) and tested for their effectiveness on two datasets of 20,000 tweets each, one composed of English and the other a mixture of English and six Bantu languages. Results showed that: conjunctively written languages should be distinguished from disjunctively written languages, because they require different preprocessing steps; verbs and adjectives, but not nouns, should be stemmed; threshold counts should be revised during topic modeling; and sentiment analysis should be done before verb stemming, in order to prevent the loss of the negation morpheme. Future work will include implementing these recommendations and assessing their effectiveness.",
