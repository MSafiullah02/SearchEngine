There also will be considerations related potentially to the exclusion of visitors, unreliable availability of blood products, and a reduction in the healthcare workforce due to the consequences of the pandemic. However, ambulatory surgery accounts for 74.7% of surgical cases performed on regular workdays (i.e., non-urgent) [7, 8] . Essential and high-priority elective surgery that can expand earliest comprise procedures that can be performed safely in free-standing buildings, whether in hospital outpatient departments or at facilities unaffiliated with hospitals [9] .

In the asymptomatic patient, radiographic changes (in the lung) are present, but the patient lacks any symptoms or has symptoms attributed to a different process (e.g., occasional cough in a patient with thoracic disease) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . Recognizing this potential hazard, the \"American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, and American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants recommend as optimal practice that all anesthesia professionals should utilize personal protective equipment appropriate for aerosol-generating procedures for all patients when working near the airway\" [20, 21] . We presume that all operating room staff (i.e., anesthesia providers, surgeons, and nurses) would be using some version of droplet precautions for all such patients [20, 21] . Other authors have discussed the implementation of barrier protection strategies, such as the use of traditional surgical mask and face shield, well fit N95 mask and face shield, etc. For our purposes of considering the economics of ambulatory surgery in the COVID era, we correspondingly partition ambulatory surgery into three categories: (section #3) no aerosol production by both the surgical procedure and the anesthetic, (#4) aerosol production by tracheal intubation and extubation, and (#5) aerosol production by the surgical procedure and general anesthetic.",

Therefore, we expect that all patients undergoing anesthesia will have RT-PCR testing the day before surgery. Early in the disease, viral load is predominantly that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f JCA_2020_582R1, Page 6 of the upper airway (nasopharynx, oropharynx) [22, 23] . RT-PCR testing of the oropharynx (subsequently referred to as \"COVID-19 testing\") has high sensitivity [22, 23] . The negative predictive value probably is effectively 99.9%, and patients would be receiving topical viral decolonization preoperatively (see section 3). Therefore, we expect limited economic effects of COVID-19 from presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients not undergoing general anesthesia. However, during progression of the disease, there is a substantial false negative rate of oropharyngeal testing [24, 25, 26, 27] . Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens have detectable SARS-CoV-2 for more samples (93%) than sputum (72%), and much more than oropharyngeal swabs (32%) [28] . Consequently, as we address in sections 4 and 5, we expect large economic effects of COVID-19 from patients receiving general anesthesia.",

Consequently, there would not be a need for airborne precautions [31] . Restricting many operating rooms from aerosol producing surgical procedures and general anesthesia would be practical because ambulatory surgery visits in the USA in 2006 were performed without general anesthesia for 69% of visits [32] . Anesthetics performed without general anesthesia accounted for 72% (SE 2%) of the anesthesia minutes among ambulatory surgery procedures performed in the USA in 2010 with an anesthesiologist and/or nurse anesthetists [33] . These statistics are functional overestimates because some aerosol producing procedures (e.g., upper gastrointestinal endoscopy) [30] are coded as being monitored anesthesia care even though the patient is \"deeply\" sedated for at least a portion of the procedure. Nevertheless, the point is that more than half of ambulatory surgery is performed without general anesthesia. There also are many common interventional During anesthesia, bacterial and viral contamination of the anesthesia workspace routinely occurs, largely due to activities of the anesthesiologist and/or nurse anesthetist caring for the patient throughout the case [1, 37, 38, 39, 40] . Multiple steps can be followed to mitigate this risk, as follows. (a) Decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes, two doses of nasal povidone-iodine [41] within 1 hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47] . In the unlikely event of an upper respiratory sample for COVID-19 being false negative among patients with presymptomatic disease, SARS-CoV-2 will have been inactivated [48] . (b) Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas [49] . (c) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the intravenous pole to the left of the providerspatial orientation matters [50] .",

Potentially, some anesthesia machines may be out of service awaiting terminal decontamination due to their use for COVID-19 patients who developed respiratory failure. However, sedation, peripheral nerve blocks, and spinal anesthetics can be performed safely, although not ideally, in the absence of an anesthesia machine. Regardless, essential surgery needs to be completed. To reduce the progressively growing surgical queues, shifts should be as long as reasonable (e.g., 12 hours) [1] . Considerable data show that with this approach, ambulatory surgery centers have underutilized capacity; extending working hours [24] , 29% (15/51) [25] , 41% (413/1014) [26] , and 63% (384/610) [27] ; pooled 48% (818/1710). The estimates are heterogeneous because upper airway involvement declines as the disease progresses [22, 23] . Bronchioalveolar lavage (93%) and sputum samples (72%) have lower false-negative rates than oropharyngeal samples (32%) [28] . Asymptomatic patients will cause environmental contamination not only during tracheal intubation [83] but after extubation. can survive for at least 3 days on a variety of materials commonly encountered in ORs (e.g., stainless steel, plastic) [85] . COVID-19 infectivity cannot be accounted for, population-wise, without including environmental contamination [86] . The necessary environmental cleaning [58, 59] applies to the area around the patient, including the phase I post-anesthesia care unit.",

Additionally, there would be multimodal environmental decontamination after each case [1] . This process includes treating operating rooms using a source generating ultraviolet-C [98, 99] Statistical methods to help the ambulatory surgery center determine how many housekeepers are needed have been developed and validated [106, 107, 108, 109] . These methods are useful in part because they are non-intuitive. First, determine the times of the workday when there are the largest number of unusually long turnovers, using one-hour epochs [106] . Making graphs or tables of the counts by hour will be helpful because the workdays should be far longer than typical before COVID-19 for ambulatory surgery centers [36, 79] . This increase in the length of the workday will occur because long-shifts reduce the amount of personal protective equipment used and reduce patient queues for care [1] . The graphs and tables help managers determine the times when the largest numbers of housekeepers are needed [106] . Next, each increase in the number of housekeepers and/or turnover teams will be associated with less overall mean minutes that teams work later than planned [107, 109] and lesser probability of prolonged turnovers [107, 108] . However, the relationship is asymptotic such that each increase in the numbers of housekeepers or teams has progressively lesser benefit [107, 109] . A useful statistic to use for managerial decisions is the mean daily minutes when the number of simultaneous turnovers is exceeding the number of housekeepers or teams [107] .",

We previously published a review article for making operating room management decisions to reduce the hours that staff work late for use by surgical suites with long (\uf0b310 hour) workdays [110] .

The United States' 2010 national ambulatory surgery survey included outpatient surgery performed at hospitals and unaffiliated free-standing surgery centers[36].There was 64% (SE 1%) of all operating room time completed before 12 noon, and 90% 1 case for 54% (SE 2%)[79]. This shows available capacity for more surgery because those single cases were of brief duration (e.g., the most common being \"repair initial inguinal hernia, age 5 years or older, reducible\") [79].4. Ambulatory surgery without aerosol production, with general anesthesiaAs context, from above, general anesthesia was provided in 31% of ambulatory surgery visitsin the USA in 2006 [32]. General anesthetics accounted for 28% (SE 2%) of the anesthesia minutes among ambulatory surgery procedures performed in the USA in 2010 with an anesthesiologist and/or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist [33]. This section does not apply to surgical procedures with airway aerosol production (e.g., thoracic surgery). The infection control steps summarized in section 3 apply. After tracheal intubation, deposit the laryngoscope blade and handle in the designated wire basket [49]. Double glove before intubation and remove the outer glove after depositing the blade [54,55,56]. Because a multimodal bundle alone (a-g) is insufficient for infection control, monitor S. aureus transmission for data feedback and to mitigate intervention fatigue [40]. Use a standard behavioral methodology [63] that works in the high task density and fast-paced operating room environments [50,80], and provide feedback that further reduces transmission events [40]. The optimization of this sampling is known [81].SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., coughing, sneezing), causing environmental contamination[82]. There are patients with minimal or ambiguous symptoms (e.g., occasional cough) but harboring SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory system based on radiological imaging[13,14,15,16,17,18,19].

The incidences of prolonged times to extubation, meaning end of surgery to tracheal extubation, are negligibly small for cases of such brief duration [90,91].There are multiple studies from the late 1990s and early 2000s on the use of different anesthetic techniques to achieve faster initial recovery for the patient to have a very brief phase I postanesthesia recovery time[76,92,93,94,95,96,97]. Anesthesia providers might need to alter some of their routine anesthetic practices accordingly.
