Scientific and technologic advances, such as the development of antibiotics and vaccines, along with improved hygiene, sanitation, and vector control, enabled dramatic improvements in health and led many to predict the end of infectious disease [1]. This was especially true in the industrialized world, but even the poorest nations showed encouraging signs of victory in the battle against infectious disease.",

It did not take into account critical factors such as the extraordinary increase in international travel and trade, and the movement of people into urban settings\u2014many into mega-cities\u2014where the spread of disease is amplified through crowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene. It also did not recognize that changing agricultural practices and environmental manipulations would dramatically alter disease vectors and opportunities for exposure. That early optimism did not reflect the continuing challenge of how to change behaviors that increase transmission and exposure, including risky sexual practices and intravenous drug use. In addition, it underestimated the extraordinary resilience and ability of microbes to change and adapt, and the continuing difficulty of ensuring that existing medical knowledge and tools translate into real-world care for anyone who needs it, whether because of inadequate resources, ignorance, or complacency. Sadly, it is now apparent that we also live in an era when we must prepare for the possibility of microbial agents being used intentionally as weapons to do harm [2].",

We have also witnessed the re-emergence or resurgence of old diseases like West Nile disease, monkeypox, dengue fever, malaria, and TB, often in new geographic regions. In some cases, the resurgence of diseases like malaria and TB has come in new and more dangerous forms that are drug-resistant, which is becoming a serious problem worldwide. Unfortunately, the widespread and often inappropriate use of antimicrobials has led to the emergence of resistant strains of many microbes, complicating the management of a wide variety of diseases, and threatening future treatment options [2].",

In many of these cases, viral genes are necessary for the initial development of the tumor as well as for the continuing survival of tumor cells in the final malignant stage. This suggests there may be opportunities to prevent or possibly cure certain cancers through control of either the initial viral infection or through the inhibition of viral functions [6].

Enchancing scientific links and forging far-reaching scientific collaborations will have many benefits. For one thing, a large share of the serious infectious disease problems of global concern currently exist or are likely to emerge from regions that include China and India. Research and development in those areas has special value because it is generally easier and more economical to study diseases where they are endemic. With respect to public health, such collaboration becomes imperative because of the transnational consequences of many of those infectious diseases. Fundamental knowledge about the nature of certain organisms and the diseases they cause, as well as opportunities for early detection, response, and control, can most effectively be achieved through broad-based collaboration. Such collaboration builds confidence and transparency and promotes sharing of data in a timely manner. This will strengthen the science base and opportunities for discovery, and amplify resources for meaningful action. Open scientific collaboration among these nations will also help to support quality research of the highest scientific and ethical standards.",

India has also begun to address this threat through policy and programs now underway [22].
