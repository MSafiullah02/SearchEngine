            "text": "Motivation: Although the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is currently over, it is expected that it will return to attack human beings. A critical challenge to scientists from various disciplines worldwide is to study the specificity of cleavage activity of SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and use the knowledge obtained from the study for effective inhibitor design to fight the disease. The most commonly used inductive programming methods for knowledge discovery from data assume that the elements of input patterns are orthogonal to each other. Suppose a sub-sequence is denoted as P 2 -P 1 -P 1 -P 2 , the conventional inductive programming method may result in a rule like 'if P 1 = Q, then the sub-sequence is cleaved, otherwise non-cleaved'. If the site P 1 is not orthogonal to the others (for instance, P 2 , P 1 and P 2 ), the prediction power of these kind of rules may be limited. Therefore this study is aimed at developing a novel method for constructing non-orthogonal decision trees for mining protease data. Result: Eighteen sequences of coronavirus polyprotein were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Among these sequences, 252 cleavage sites were experimentally determined. These sequences were scanned using a sliding window with size k to generate about 50 000 k -mer sub-sequences (for short, k -mers). The value of k varies from 4 to 12 with a gap of two. The bio-basis function proposed by Thomson et al. is used to transform the k -mers to a high-dimensional numerical space on which an inductive programming method is applied for the purpose of deriving a decision tree for decision-making. The process of this transform is referred to as a bio-mapping. The constructed decision trees select about 10 out of 50 000 k -mers. This small set of selected k -mers is regarded as a set of decisive templates. By doing so, non-orthogonal decision trees are constructed using the selected templates and the prediction accuracy is significantly improved.

SARS has dramatically demonstrated the wide-ranging impact on a highly mobile world. In response to the SARS outbreak, delegates of the 56th World Health Assembly, organized by WHO in May 2003, unanimously adopted a resolution authorizing WHO to act on information arising from sources other than official government notifications. In addition, WHO was asked to conduct on-the-spot investigations to ensure that an affected country has sufficient control to prevent international spread.",

SARS-CoV as a novel coronavirus (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Yount et al., 2003) is an infectious respiratory disease. It starts with a fever, chills, headache and body aches, followed by a dry cough within 2-7 days. The most distinguishing feature is breathing difficulty. In severe cases, radiography can provide corroborative evidence of SARS by diagnosing pneumonia. The virus has a spherical enveloped virion. The size is between 80 and 160 nm diameters with a single stranded RNA of about 30 kb, which is the largest genome of all single stranded RNA viruses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2002) . In the electron micrograph image, glycoproteins on the virus' surface give the virions a halo or crown-like appearance, and hence the name coronavirus.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with exceptionally large genome sizes (Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002) . The replication and transcription of coronaviruses are encoded by the replicase genes (Thiel et al., 2001a,b) . In many studies, 15-mers (P 8 -P 7 -P 6 -P 5 -P 4 -P 3 -P 2 -P 1 -P 1 -P 2 -P 3 -P 4 -P 5 -P 6 -P 7 ) were used to represent corresponding 3CL pro cleavage sites in the replicase polyproteins (Merrifield, 1965) . It was indicated in Hegyi and Ziebuhr (2002) and Pallai et al. (1989) that the conserved prototypic viruses suggest that the order of cleavage events may occur in all coronaviruses. The structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV protease have been analysed using a molecular dynamics simulation technique (Lee et al., 2003) , where molecular docking has been carried out in order to search for potential SARS-CoV protease inhibitors. Previously characterized coronaviruses encode two papain-like cysteine proteases (PL1 pro and PL2 pro ), which cleave the N-proximal polyprotein regions at three sites (Bonilla et al., 1997; Gorbalenya et al., 1991; Herold et al., 1998; Thiel et al., 2001b; Ziebuhr et al., 2001) . The recent studies show that 3C-like cysteine protease (3CL pro ) cleaves the central and C-proximal regions at 11 conserved sites (Hardy et al., 2002; Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002; Tibbles et al., 1999; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) .",

If the patterns are not complicated (i.e., the sites in the sub-sequences are orthogonal to each other), simple rules can be explored by using inductive programming methods; the prediction of phosphorylation sites in proteins is such a case . However, most cases are not simple. The success of prediction of the functional sites needs more advanced investigation (Thomson et al., 2003; Yang and Chou, 2004a,b) . A novel method is therefore proposed in this study for mining sub-sequence data. Instead of using the sites in k-mers as the inputs to an inductive programming model, it is proposed to transform k-mers to a high-dimensional numerical space through a mapping. An inductive programming method is then used in this high-dimensional space. The transform of k-mers needs a proper function to ensure the biological content in the k-mers can be maintained for data mining. In this study, the bio-basis function proposed in Thomson et al. (2003) is used for this mapping, referred to as a bio-mapping. With the bio-mapping, each k-mer is represented using a vector denoting its position in this high-dimensional space. After the mapping, an inductive programming is employed regarding the mapping vectors as the inputs. The modelling process itself will select the most informative and decisive k-mers to construct a nonorthogonal decision tree. These selected k-mers are then regarded as the templates for decision-making. Importantly, these templates are the representatives for the training k-mers, and hence the knowledge hidden in the training k-mers. Instead of resulting in rules like 'if P 1 = Q, then the k-mer cleaved', non-orthogonal decision trees will have rules like 'if a query k-mer is similar to a cleaved template, then the k-mer is cleaved'.",

They select a hyper-plane orthogonal to an axis of a variable through maximizing its 'purity'. If a hyper-plane can make 100% separation between patterns from two classes with respect to a certain threshold value, its purity is 1. Otherwise, the purity value will be <1. Each hyper-plane divides a given region into two disjoint sub-regions. If each subregion only comprises one class of patterns, the hyper-plane has a purity value as 1. The process of selecting hyper-planes continues till each resulting subregion is pure for one class. The node which is pure for one class is referred to as a leaf. In terms of this, each leaf has an associated class label. From this, an inductive model is constructed and the training stage is completed. Various tree-pruning methods can be used to prevent over-fitting. In the testing stage, the hyper-planes will progressively lead a novel pattern into a leaf. Up to this end the classification of this novel pattern is completed through assigning the class label associated with the leaf to the novel pattern. Figure 1 shows a decision tree model, where there are two variables and the whole region is divided into six sub-regions. The first hyper-plane makes a separation using the threshold value a for the variable x. Both resulting sub-regions on the left and right of the hyper-plane are not pure. The second hyper-plane divides the left sub-region generated by the first hyper-plane into two smaller sub-regions using the threshold value b for the variable y. The upper sub-region has been pure for one class while the lower sub-region is still not pure and needs more separation.",

C4.5 was also used for the prediction of phenotypes associated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes on the basis of gene ontology functional annotations from the relevant databanks . Decision trees were compared with support vector machines for the prediction of the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein function (Krishnan and Westhead, 2003) . The study shows that the decision trees have the advantage of generating interpreting rules although they have a lower prediction accuracy than support vector machines. In Li et al. (2003) , decision trees were used for identifying genes related with cancer, and hence they provided knowledge for cancer diagnosis. King and his colleague studied the use of C4.5 for discovering rules for the prediction of the ORFs whose function is unknown (Clare and King, 2003) . The alternative decision tree (Freund and Mason, 1999) was used for predicting the genetic regulatory response (Middendorf et al., 2004) . In Selbig et al. (1999) , decision trees were used for the prediction of secondary structures. Decision trees were also used in searching short and statistically significant emerging patterns for cancer diagnosis using gene expression profiles (Boulesteix et al., 2003) .",

The prediction performance is assessed using five indicators, the true positive fraction (TPf), true negative fraction (TNf), total accuracy (Total), Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) (Matthews, 1975) The positive prediction power measures the likelihood that a predicted positive is the true positive. Matthews' correlation coefficient measures how the prediction correlates with the real target value. Matthews' correlation coefficient has been widely used in biology and bioinformatics (Gorodkin, 2004) . There is a risk of losing information when using the total accuracy when the disparity in the data is large, which is very common in analysing biological data; the Matthews correlation coefficient remedies this problem. When its value is 1, it means a perfect prediction; if it is 0, it means for a completely random assignment. The larger the value, the better the prediction performance. In the assessment, the combination of the TPf and the PPf can be used to visualize the model comparison. Figure 3 shows the performance of three sets of models using window size 4, where 'NM' means the models without any bio-mapping and hence orthogonal decision trees, 'BM1' the models using the first bio-mapping strategy and 'BM2' the second bio-mapping strategy. It can be seen that 'BM2' worked the best. The NM models did not work well since they are unable to predict cleaved k-mers well. When the window size is increased, the performance was similar in general (data not shown). Figure 4 shows a comparison among three sets of models using TPf as the horizontal axis and PPf as the vertical axis. Each set has five points representing five models each of which uses a distinct window Fig. 3 . The performance of 10-fold cross-validation performance. The horizontal axis represents the measurement indicators and the vertical axis the performance. Although 'NM' gives a high total prediction accuracy, its sensitivity is very low (<70%). For all the measurement indicators, 'BM2' outperformed 'BM1' meaning the positive k-mers are important for template selection.",

It has been found in the simulation that this novel method showed great success in two aspects: success in improving the prediction accuracy and success in extracting the most important k-mers as templates for decision-making. Two strategies were introduced for bio-mapping. The first strategy referred to as 'BM1' selects templates from all the k-mers. The second strategy referred to as 'BM2' selects templates only from the cleaved k-mers based on the observation made in our earlier study that most non-cleaved k-mers do not show conserved patterns.

This means that in the real use of a computer program for computer-aided drug design, biological knowledge should be used to alter the information provided by the decision-making system made by a computer program.",
