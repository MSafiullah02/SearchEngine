We aimed to assess the impact of the quarantine due to COVID-19 on psychological (in particular anxiety and depression symptoms) and sexual well-being. The sample was drawn through posts on social networks (Instagram \u00ae and Facebook \u00ae ) and the survey was administered online through Google Forms. Participants completed the survey with questions about their sexual habits they had before and during the quarantine ( Table 1 ). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) [3] in its Italian validated version [4] and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [5] in the Italian validated version [4] were used. Moreover, sexual satisfaction was evaluated by asking the question \"Overall, how satisfied are you with your sex life during quarantine on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied)?\" and people were asked \"Have you been quarantined as positive for COVID-19?\". The survey also investigated items about autoerotism during and before quarantine. Supplementary Table 1 shows the questions of the survey.",

However, the reported enhanced sex arousal did not translate into a higher frequency of sexual intercourse (18.75% and 15.78% before and during quarantine, respectively). Moreover, sexual satisfaction significantly decreased during the quarantine, with more than half of the respondents describing a complete absence of sexual satisfaction, compared with only 7.46% of people before the lockdown. These results can be partly explained by a self-reported increase of autoerotism in 40% of the participants and a high prevalence of pornography use between the responders; in fact, it is widely accepted that pornography use is associated with decreased sexual satisfaction [6] .",

However, this survey is one of the few reports evaluating the impact of quarantine on sexuality of males and females. We found that lower age and higher depression score were significant predictors of sexual dissatisfaction in both genders. Interestingly, we found that women who knew patients positive for COVID-19 were at a reduced risk of sexual satisfaction, may be due to the mitigation of stress secondary to a better knowledge of the disease itself. Further analyses and longer follow-up after the quarantine are required in order to confirm these preliminary results and to investigate different changes in sexual health.",
