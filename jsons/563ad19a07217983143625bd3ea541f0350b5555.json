(1) (2) (3) The rate of rise in Covid-19 infection and its associated outcomes in the United States is now comparable to rates observed in other severely affected countries such as China, Italy, and Spain. (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) The spread of Covid-19 in the United States has been especially pronounced in the states of California, New York, Michigan, Louisiana, and Washington. (11) Consistently reported across all regions is the observation that, of all individuals who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, a majority tend to have mild or no symptoms; however, an important minority will develop predominantly respiratory disease that can lead to critical illness and death. (12) (13) (14) (15) Multiple, reports suggest that certain demographic and clinical characteristics may predispose infected persons to more severe manifestations of Covid-19, such as older age, male sex, and pre-existing hypertension, pulmonary disease, or cardiovascular disease. (4, (16) (17) (18) (19) Given that these traits tend to cluster among the same persons, the relative contribution of each trait to the risk for developing more severe presentations of Covid-19 illness remains unclear.",

We conducted iterative quality control and quality assurance analyses on all data extracted directly from the EHR and used manual chart review to verify collected data on clinical characteristics where appropriate. To capture variation in relative comorbid status, in a way that is not captured by distinct medical history variables alone, we calculated the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) with van Walraven weighting for all patients based on all available clinical data.(20-23) The ECI uses 31 categories to quantify a patient's burden of comorbid conditions and has been shown to outperform other indices in predicting adverse outcomes (Supplemental Table 1 ).(22-28) For patients admitted to the hospital, length of stay, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and death were ascertained from time stamps recorded for admission, unit transfers, and discharge.

We constructed the illness severity score, with higher values assigned to needing more intensive levels of clinical care, based on the following stepwise categories: 0 = clinically deemed to not require admission; 1 = required hospital admission but never required intensive care; 2 = required intensive level care but never intubation; and, 3 = required intubation during hospitalization.

(35) Consistent with worldwide reports, we found that the association of male sex with greater odds for every metric of Covid-19 illness severity was especially prominent -and this was not explained by age variation, risk factors, or comorbidities.(36) Reasons for the male predominance of illness severity remain unclear. Although ACE2 genetic expression is on the X chromosome, evidence to date would suggest relatively comparable expression levels between sexes,(37, 38) albeit with some potential for variation in relation to differences in sex hormones; select animal studies have shown increased ACE2 activity in the setting of ovariectomy and the opposite effect with orchietomy.(39, 40) While there remains scant data currently available to explain sex differences for Covid-19, male sex bias was also observed for SARS and MERS. (41, 42) Similar to the findings in our study, this increase risk was not attributable to a greater prevalence of smoking among men. Notably, prior murine studies have also demonstrated male versus female bias in susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection, which may be related to the effects of sex-specific steroids and X-linked gene activity on modulation of both the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infection. (43) Further research specific to the sexual dimorphism seen in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility is needed.",

Although an overall risk association was not seen for Hispanic ethnicity, there was a trend towards greater Covid-19 illness severity in younger aged compared to older aged Hispanic/Latino persons. A recent national report from the CDC also suggests overall higher rates of Covid-19 susceptibility in African Americans, and our findings confirm this trend exists even after adjusting for age, risk factors, and comorbidities. (44) In addition to the effects of unmeasured socioeconiomic and healthcare access variables, racial/ethnic disparities in Covid-19 illness severity may relate to yet unidentified host-viral susceptibility factors that could also be contributing to heterogeneity of community transmission seen across regions worldwide and populations at large. (45) The use of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications has been controversial given the possibility that these agents upregulate the expression of ACE2, which is the viral point of entry into cells. (46) Indeed, the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now known to bind ACE2 to enter alveolar type 2 epithelial cells, in particular. (47) Other data suggest that reduced ACE2 activity might lead to local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and, thus, a potential benefit for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors has been proposed.(35, 46, 48) Although we observed a non-significant trend in association of chronic ACE inhibitor treatment with lower Covid-19 illness severity, we found evidence of neither risk nor benefit with ARBs. In future larger studies, more ideally powered to detect such associations, a protective effect of ACE inhibition on Covid-19 outcomes would raise the specter of high-level homology between ACE and ACE2, potentially allowing for ACE inhibitors to bind ACE2 and block viral entry despite the lack of inhibition of the catalytic domain.(49) Such findings would underscore the importance of considering modified or tailored ACE inhibition to exploit the structural basis of the binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2.(50, 51) Together, our All rights reserved.

The Cedars-Sinai Health System includes Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC), Marina Del Rey Hospital (MDRH), and affiliated clinics. For the current study, we included all patients who were found to have a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while being evaluated or treated for signs or symptoms concerning for Covid-19 at CSMC or MDRH, beginning after the first confirmed case of community transmission was reported in the U.S. on Feburary 26, 2020. Subsquently, the first laboratory confirmed Covid-19 case in our health system was on March 8, 2020. All laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been performed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of extracted RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs. All patient testing was performed by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health until March 21, 2020, at which time the CSMC Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine began using the A*STAR FORTITUDE KIT 2.0 COVID-19 Real-Time RT-PCR Test (Accelerate Technologies Pte Ltd, Singapore). For the minority of patients in our study who had SARS-CoV-2 testing performed at an outside facility (3.6%), documentation of a positive test was carefully reviewed by our medical staff and considered comparable for accuracy.",

Given the relatively small number of observed in-hospital deaths (N=11), and thus limited statistical power to detect assocations, we deferred analyses of pre-existing characteristics and mortality risk to future investigations. The modest size of this early analysis of our growing clinical cohort may have limited the ability to detect potential additional predictors of Covid-19 illness severity; thus, further investigations are needed in larger sized samples. Finally, our results are derived from a single healthcare system, albeit multi-center and serving a large catchment of the diverse population of Los Angeles, California. Additional studies are needed to examine the extent to which our findings are generalizable to other populations affected by Covid-19.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
