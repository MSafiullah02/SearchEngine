Therefore, China is expected to attract more overseas pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, pharmaceutical products rely heavily on the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), so it is essential for those overseas pharmaceutical companies to have a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding laws and regulations, to adjust their strategy for IPR protection to better benefit from their products in the Chinese market. Up to date, China has gone through a few milestone IPR changes and has established a relatively comprehensive legal system in relation to IPR protection. The core IPR protection is through the implementation of the patent laws and regulations. The state IP office of China and its branches are the key IPR executing agents (Liu 2009 ) . The intellectual assets are protected by patents, administrative regulations (Table 2. 2), trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets (Qu 2010) . The patent law (Amendment to Patent Law 2008) is the most important one for IPR protection, which adopted the international standard of novelty examination to conduct drug patent review and approval. In terms of drug patent administration, new articles of parallel importing, compulsory licensing, and the exemption (Bolar exemption) for drug clinical trial and its dossier application are added. To enforce drug patent protection, the new patent law increased administrative penalties for patent violations. These newly added articles provide stronger protection for the IPR.",

China's patent law requires that invention patents and utility model patents to possess novelty, creativity and practical applicability. The required standards were further raised in the revised Patent Law. To grant a Chinese patent, China patent office adopted the \"absolute novelty\" standard that is used internationally, i.e. the invention is not known publicly either inside or outside China prior to the date of application for a patent. For the invention patent, a finished drug must be defined in terms of usage, i.e. the applicant must clearly state in the application for the diagnostic or therapeutic indications of the drug (Zhang 2008) .

One of the major reasons is the attractive incentives originated from the Chinese government (Zhao 2012) . In 2008, the Chinese government issued the National Intellectual Property Strategy and various incentive programs. Those programs provided generous funding to encourage domestic companies, research institutes, and universities to seek patent protection for their innovations. These incentives have significantly boosted the new patent filings by Chinese domestic companies. While at the same time, China has become the world's top litigious country for intellectual property disputes since 2005 with a total of 13,424 cases filed with Chinese courts (Figs. 2.5 and 2.6) versus 10,905 cases filed in the U.S. during the same period (SIPO 2006) .",
