Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gains access to host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed in the type II surfactant-secreting alveolar cells of the lungs.2 Severe COVID-19 is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with abundant neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and immune mediators. Which mediators are most important in driving the immune pathology remains to be elucidated. Deaths from COVID-19 are chiefly due to diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate compatible with early-phase adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).3 Prevention of ARDS and death in patients with COVID-19 is a pressing health emergency.",

            "text": "The potential role of anti-TNF therapy thus warrants consideration. Preclinical studies suggest that the response to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza in mice is ameliorated by anti-TNF therapy, which reduces weight loss, disease duration, and cell and fluid infiltrate.11 This research suggests a potential rationale for use of anti-TNF therapy in viral pneumonia, especially given the known mechanism of action of TNF and the reversal of TNF-induced immunopathology by TNF blockade in multiple diseases. It is known TNF is produced in most types of inflammation, especially in the acute phase, and is important in the coordination and development of the inflammatory response. However, too much production of TNF for too long becomes immune suppressive.12 Blockade of TNF alone is clinically effective in many circumstances and diseases, despite the presence of many other pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. There is evidence of a \u201cTNF dependent cytokine cascade\u201d in rheumatoid arthritis tissue and upon bacterial challenge in baboons.13, 14 Thus, if TNF is blocked, there is a rapid (ie, <12 h) decrease of IL-6 and IL-1 concentrations in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis15 and, importantly, a reduction of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor, which is also known as vascular permeability factor, denoting its importance in capillary leak.15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Furthermore, a reduction in leucocyte trafficking occurs in inflamed tissues of joints due to reduction in adhesion molecules and chemokines20 with reduction in cell content and exudate. Finally, after anti-TNF infusion tissue TNF is reduced as it passes into the blood bound to the anti-TNF antibody. Blood concentrations of immunoreactive, but biologically inactive, TNF increase more than ten times after infusion.15 For these reasons it is possible that a single infusion of anti-TNF antibody might reduce some of the processes that occur during COVID-19 lung inflammation, reducing TNF and other inflammatory mediators, cellularity, and exudate.",

We propose that initial assessment of anti-TNF therapy in clinical trials should be in patients with moderate disease admitted to hospital and who require oxygen support but not intensive care. If this treatment approach proved beneficial with a good safety profile, treatment in the community for people identified as being at high risk of progressing to hospital admission might be considered.

After respiratory viral infection, superinfections with other organisms occur at the most severe end of the disease spectrum. Many research groups have elucidated the mechanisms responsible21 and anecdotal evidence suggests that bacteria might have a role in in COVID-19,5, 22 although this remains to be confirmed. Bacteria gain a foothold faster in a lung that is damaged. Experimental studies suggest that if the duration of inflammation is limited, with its associated collateral lung damage, then bacterial superinfection is reduced.23 There is concern that anti-TNF therapy might increase the risk of bacterial infection.24 Yet two randomised studies in critically unwell patients with septic shock25, 26 showed that monoclonal anti-TNF therapy had good safety data with no evidence of increased secondary bacterial infections in the anti-TNF treated group. In an observational trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients with serious infections, the risk of sepsis and death was reduced in patients on TNF inhibitors compared with those on synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS).27 46 (11%) of 399 patients on TNF inhibitors developed sepsis after serious infection, of whom 20 (43%) died, compared with 74 (17%) of 444 patients on DMARDS who developed sepsis, of whom 54 (74%) died.27 Paradoxically, another class of TNF inhibitor, a TNF-R2 Ig-Fc fusion protein, etanercept, was associated with moderately increased mortality in a randomised trial of this treatment for sepsis,28 possibly due to its faster off-rate for TNF potentially resulting in some redistribution and bioavailability of pathogenic TNF rather than its clearance.",

As of April 6, 2020, on SECURE-IBD, a coronavirus and IBD reporting database with a register of outcomes of IBD patients with COVID-19, there were 116 patients on anti-TNF therapy alone, 99 of whom recovered without hospitalisation and one patient died. By contrast, about half of 71 patients on sulfasalazine/mesalamine recovered without hospital admission and six patients died. Thus IBD patients with COVID-19 on anti-TNF therapy do not fare worse than those treated with other drugs, but there are insufficient data to make conclusions about a better outcome.",

If there is preliminary evidence of benefit and safety of anti-TNF therapy in hospitalised patients, we suggest consideration should be given to out of hospital treatment for patients with COVID-19 at high risk, such as older people and those with pre-existing conditions, and who can be monitored appropriately.",
