For predicting the trend of the Corona Virus spread, several time delay dynamic systems (TDD) are proposed. In this paper, we establish a novel fractional time delay dynamic system (FTDD) to describe the local outbreak of COVID-19. The fractional derivative is introduced to account for the sub-diffusion process of the confirmed and cured peoples growth. Based on the public health data by the government, we propose a stable reconstruction algorithm of the coefficients. The reconstructed coefficients are used to predict the trend of the Corona-Virus. The numerical results are in good agreement with the public data.",
