As shown in Figure 1C, the magnitude of activity in peripheral blood was low. For example, in 18 donors screened (age range, 24\u201359 years; mean age [\u00b1standard error of the mean {SEM}], 35 \u00b1 2.1 years), we detected the following mean numbers (\u00b1SEM) of antigen-reactive SFCs/5 \u00d7 105 input PBMCs: 7.7 \u00b1 1.3 for N, 5.7 \u00b1 2.1 for P, 8.2 \u00b1 1.9 for M, 12.0 \u00b1 2.6 for F, 7.4 \u00b1 1.7 for M2-1, 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 for M2-2, and 2.0 \u00b1 0.4, 3.4 \u00b1 1.1, and 3.2 \u00b1 0.7 for SH, G, and L, respectively.

Thus, we exposed PBMCs from 29 healthy individuals (age range, 21\u201359 years; mean age [\u00b1SEM], 32 \u00b1 1.6 years) to a mastermix of the hMPV peptide libraries and allowed reactive T cells to expand for 9\u201311 days. Overall, we achieved a mean fold-increase (\u00b1SEM) 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 in total cell numbers (n = 29; Figure 2A), and the expanded populations comprised CD3+ T cells (91.7% \u00b1 1%), with a mix of cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells (29.5% \u00b1 2.3%) and helper (CD4+) T cells (61.8% \u00b1 2.3%; Figure 2B), with no evidence of regulatory T-cell outgrowth, as assessed by CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ staining (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, the expanded cells expressed both central (CD45RO+CD62L+; mean [\u00b1SEM], 38.6% \u00b1 2.4%) and effector (CD45RO+CD62L\u2212; mean [\u00b1SEM], 26.9% \u00b1 2.2%) memory markers (n = 29; Figure 2B). To next determine whether we had enriched for hMPV-reactive cells, we assessed specificity by the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay, and, as shown in Figure 3A, we were readily able to expand populations that were specific for all antigens except M2-2. The fold enrichment achieved is summarized in Figure 3B. These data suggest that hMPV-specific T cells reside in the memory pool and can be readily amplified ex vivo.",

She presented with symptoms including congestion, rhinorrhea, and cough, and hMPV was detected by respiratory virus panel (RVP) screening performed on a nasal wash sample. Since her symptoms had resolved by day 5 before transplant receipt, her myeloablative transplantation proceeded on schedule, but hMPV remained detectable by RVP PCR until day 45 after transplantation. To assess whether reconstituting hMPV-specific T cells contributed to viral clearance, we collected blood specimens before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after HSCT receipt and measured specific T-cell activity. As shown in Figure 6C, this patient exhibited strong T-cell activity as early as 3 weeks after transplantation, which subsequently declined coincident with viral clearance. We were able to detect similar patterns of T-cell activity in 3 additional transplant recipients with confirmed hMPV infections that were cleared.

Thus, we first sought to identify appropriate hMPV antigens against which an effector T-cell response might be generated. Prior to the current study, there was limited information on immunity to hMPV, although there is some evidence to suggest the importance of cell-mediated over humoral antiviral activity. For example, in immunocompromised individuals (eg, human immunodeficiency virus\u2013infected patients and steroid-treated HSCT recipients), hMPV infections can be severe and sometimes fatal [23, 34\u201336], and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin has not proven beneficial [23, 30]. In murine studies, Kolli et al intranasally infected BALB/c mice with a laboratory strain of hMPV (CAN97-83) or exposed animals to UV-inactivated hMPV and demonstrated that the depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells compromised the animals\u2019 ability to control/clear the viral challenge [37]. Similarly, Hastings et al vaccinated HLA-A2 transgenic C57BL/6 mice with either an hMPV M\u2013derived CD8+ T-cell epitope or irrelevant control, challenged them with a live hMPV strain (TN/94-49), and demonstrated that the viral load in the lungs of vaccinated animals was significantly lower than that for control mice [38]. Finally, Herd et al demonstrated that T cells with an effector profile, characterized by production of both prototypic Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF, and interleukin 12) and proinflammatory chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3\u2013inducible protein 10), were able to accumulate at the lung following hMPV infection [39]. However, since immune studies of human viruses performed in animals do not always faithfully recapitulate studies performed in the natural host, we sought to analyze the T-cell response to hMPV in healthy human subjects and hMPV-infected HSCT recipients. We initiated our studies in healthy adults and discovered that the frequency of circulating hMPV-reactive T cells was at or below the threshold of our detection assay (IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT). However, reactive cells could readily be expanded to numbers that were clinically relevant [7, 9, 40] with a single in vitro stimulation.",

Finally, to establish the feasibility of using adoptively transferred T cells as a prophylactic or therapeutic approach in immunocompromised patients, we demonstrate that hMPV-reactive T cells with a Th1-polarized effector profile can be successfully expanded to clinically relevant numbers in vitro by means of manufacturing approaches compliant with good manufacturing practice.
