Figures may even be overestimated since three patients receiving successful DLI, because of early mixed chimerism, were regarded as successful. Data in relation to HLA disparity and graft failure in HS are conflicting: Peters et al.10 noted inferior outcome with HLA mismatch while Souillet et al.11 did not. In the study by Souillet et al.,11 16/27 patients received a mismatched graft (1\u20134 mismatches) with no documented higher incidence of graft failure or GvHD. In this study, the largest series, including some (n=20) of the patients described by Souillet et al.,11 HLA disparity was found to be a risk factor in the 1994\u20131998 period but not thereafter. Improved supportive care (for example, firmer GvHD prophylaxis) is probably an important factor in this observation. Additionally, the use of (mismatch) CB (mainly used after 1998) might have influenced the observation that mismatching was not associated with a higher incidence of graft failure after 1998, since mismatches in CB vs BM/PBSC are not biologically equivalent. Similar experience has been observed elsewhere.12, 20, 21",

            "text": "The observation of less mixed chimerism in patients receiving CB is intriguing. It might be that the higher degree of HLA mismatch23 exerts a stronger graft-versus-marrow (GvM) effect. The fact that this GvM effect is associated with subclinical GvHD might be due to the fact that CB cells have a more naive phenotype. This might make the marrow more sensitive to GvM in comparison to the known target organs of GvHD. Another explanation might be the increased pluripotential capability of the CB stem cell, relative to adult stem cell, with higher proliferative potentials in comparison to BM.24, 25, 26 We are aware from animal studies that the addition of mesenchymal stem cells to the SCT product results in less graft rejection, due to the immunomodulating potential of these cells.27, 28 Other advantages of CB include (1) lower rates for acute GvHD and extensive chronic GvHD in comparison to unrelated donors,29, 30, 31, 32 (2) immediate availability,23 reducing the period between diagnosis and SCT (in this study 7.5 months), which might improve the long-term outcome, (3) reduced likelihood of transmitting infection (viral) and (4) the suggestion that a more primitive stem cell population might have a greater capacity for trans-differentiation.24, 25, 26 This latter capability might be particularly important in SCT for inborn errors of metabolism, by theoretically improving delivery of enzyme to bone, cartilage and brain tissue. More research is warranted to study this hypothesis.",
