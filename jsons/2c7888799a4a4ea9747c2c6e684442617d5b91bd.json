With the onset of COVID-19 we have noticed an increase in the number of patients who have presented with new onset of complete smell loss to the senior author's practice in Tehran, Iran. This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic. We hypothesize that the mechanism of injury is similar to that of other coronavirus infections that cause central and peripheral neurologic deficits.",

            "text": "In the head and neck area, coronaviruses have traditionally caused illnesses that are mild and along the spectrum of symptoms expected with the common cold. 1 The coronavirus was first cultivated by Tyrell and Bynoe in patients with the common cold in 1966. 2 The alpha coronaviruses typically cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. 3 However, the beta coronaviruses (the group which includes SARS-Cov-2), cause severe respiratory disease and fatalities. 3 In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus related disease has been named COVID-19. Symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients in China include fever, cough, fatigue, 4 myalgia, sputum production, dyspnea, oppression in the chest, diarrhea, headache, anorexia, chest pain, sore throat, dizziness, palpitations and vomiting. 5 Although coronaviruses are known to cause the common cold and olfactory loss is known to be associated with the common cold, 6 the initial reports from China did not include anosmia as one of the possible presenting symptoms of COVID-19. A short communication from Italy reported a possible association between COVID-19 and anosmia. 7 A 2004 study from Japan evaluated 24 patients who presented over a four-year period with sudden onset of smell loss and had a normal exam of the nose. Ten of those patients were evaluated with viral analysis. Only one patient tested positive for human coronavirus 229E. 1 Of the ten patients the most common cause of post viral olfactory loss was human rhinovirus, followed by Epstein Barr virus. One patient out of the ten had anosmia and one had dysosmia. The remainder had hyposmia. 1 In terms of prevalence of smell disorders, up to 10.6 percent of the population self-report a problem with smell or taste during a 12 month period. 8 The olfactory sensory neurons are bipolar and are directly exposed to the environment, which can result in damage from toxic, infectious, chemical or inflammatory agents. 9 Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory, neurologic, gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases of varying severity in humans and animals. 10 Beta coronaviruses are known to cause encephalomyelitis in pigs and encephalitis and chronic demyelination in the mouse and rat. 11 With the recent pandemic of COVID-19, patients reporting anosmia of recent and sudden onset have been more frequent in the senior author's office in Tehran, Iran. We present these cases as the history of these patients is atypical and the anosmia with which they present is unusual and the frequency with which we have seen anosmia over a two-week period is unusual. Early screening of patients with reports of acute anosmia and testing for COVID-19 may help identify patients who are infected who otherwise would be missed.",

This presentation frequency is consistent with the frequency with which we saw acute viral olfactory disorders in our offices in the past. In contrast, our case series presents 8 patients during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five patients out of eight were tested for COVID-19. The other three have not been able to be tested given the limitations of testing during the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of patients had atypical histories--they either had no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms, and the smell loss is complete. In the previous study of acute viral olfactory change, the majority of patients had hyposmia. Only one had anosmia and the other had dysosmia. 1 In our case series all presented with anosmia and many had the sensation of loss of sense of taste.
