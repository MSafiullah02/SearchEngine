The surgical pathologist's ability to diagnose infectious processes in tissue sections has grown exponentially with the advent of new histochemical stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and numerous other molecular methodologies.

The ulcers often have associated inflammatory exudate or inflammatory polyps. Intervening mucosa is often normal. Ulcers may undermine adjacent mucosa to produce the classic \u2018flask\u2010shaped\u2019 lesion. The caecum is most commonly involved, but any level of the large bowel or appendix may be involved. Fulminant colitis resembling ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis resembling that caused by C. difficile, and toxic megacolon have been described.\n30\n Colonoscopy may be normal in asymptomatic patients or those with mild disease.\n29\n Histologically, the earliest lesion is a mild neutrophilic infiltrate. In more advanced disease, ulcers are often deep, extending at least into the submucosa, with undermining of adjacent normal mucosa. There is associated necroinflammatory debris; the organisms are generally found within this purulent material. Invasive amoebae are occasionally seen within the bowel wall. The adjacent mucosa is usually normal, but may show gland distortion and inflammation. The organisms, which may be very few in number, resemble macrophages with foamy cytoplasm and a round, eccentric nucleus; the presence of ingested red blood cells is pathognomonic of Entamoeba histolytica.\n30\n In patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, histological changes may be subtle and organisms may be particularly difficult (if not impossible) to find. Invasive amoebiasis is not generally seen in patients with mild or absent symptoms.\n29\n\n",
