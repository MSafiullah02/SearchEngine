            "text": "Vasculitis, characterized by inflammation and necrosis, manifests a wide spectrum of presentation by involving a vasculature of various sizes and locations. It can present clinically as urticaria, purpura, papules, nodules, erythema, ulcer, infarct, or livedo reticularis. A definitive diagnosis of vasculitis invariably requires histologic confirmation since there are no diagnostic clinical, imaging, or laboratory findings. A skin biopsy would provide information regarding the size of the involved vessels and the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate (neutrophils, lymphocytes, or histiocytes). The optimal time frame would be 24\u201348 hours after lesion onset. Vasculitis can be primary or secondary to drugs, infection, underlying systemic disease, or trauma. Therefore, a diagnosis of vasculitis cannot be based on histologic ground alone. It requires clinical pathologic correlation.",

The initial classification scheme was proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990 based mainly on clinical symptoms [1]. The subcommittee on Classification of Vasculitides analyzed 1000 consecutive patients with definitive vasculitis and proposed classification criteria for hypersensitivity vasculitis, Henoch- Schonlein purpura, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener granulomatosis, Takayasu arteritis, and giant cell arteritis (Table 7.1) [1\u20133]. The criteria present in one type of vasculitis but absent or infrequent in the other types were excluded; thus, sensitivity and specificity were low for hypersensitivity vasculitis. In a recent series of 1095 patients with primary vasculitis and 415 with comparable diseases, using ACR criteria the sensitivity of each type of vasculitis has decreased although specificity remains high [4]. In 2010 the European League Against Rheumatism and Pediatric Rheumatology European Society have outlined consensus criteria for the classification of childhood vasculitis [5].",

This classification allows differentiation of immune complex-mediated vasculitis such as Henoch-Schonlein purpura and essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis from nonimmune complex ones. It also classifies vasculitides based on the size of the involved vessels: small vessel (<50 um), medium vessel (50\u2013100 um), and large vessel (>150 um) (Fig. 7.1). However, classification by vessel size is imperfect due to overlapping vessel sizes. There is an overlap with arterial involvement since all three major categories of vasculitis can affect any artery size. While microscopic polyangiitis affects mainly the small vessels, polyarteritis nodosa involves medium-sized arteries. The criteria have been modified by the CHCC in 2012 (Table 7.2) [1\u20133]. These criteria are for classification and they are not for diagnostic purposes.",

The localized GPA is characterized by eye and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) involvement, small percentage of ANCA positivity, severe local damages, and frequent relapses. The age of the patients at presentation is often between 50 and 75 years. Nasal sinus involvement is reported in 70\u2013100% of cases at the time of diagnosis and might be the only symptom in the localized form of the disease. Saddle nose deformity is due to the destruction of the nasal cartilage (Fig. 7.15). The lungs can be affected in 50\u201390% of patients resulting in alveolar hemorrhage and/or parenchymal nodules [48]. The kidney is often affected in 40\u2013100%. Skin involvement is seen in 50% of patients and presents as polymorphic papules, nodules, vesicles, and blisters on a background of livedo reticularis. They most commonly occur on the lower extremities but also the face and scalp.",

Although the etiology remains unknown, ultraviolet light exposure, radiation, trauma, and allergy have been implicated as predisposing factors. It is currently thought by many to be a chronic form of cutaneous vasculitis. The documentation of perivascular IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 deposition on direct immunofluorescence studies is supportive of the speculation that classical pathway activation of complement is causative of vasculitis in granuloma faciale [109].",

EED, another distinctive form of chronic recurrent form of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, often presents as symmetrical, firm, tender, reddish-brown papules and nodules on the extensor aspects of the extremities of middle-aged and older adults. There is no gender predilection. They are located on the fingers, hands, elbows, ankles, and knees. EED often follows a chronic clinical course. Although the etiology is unknown, the thought is that it is likely secondary to vascular immune complex deposition due to its association with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and diabetes mellitus. Associated infections include tuberculosis, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus [110]. Early histopathologic changes of EED include leukocytoclastic vasculitis and a mixed dermal infiltrate containing neutrophils, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. As the lesion ages, histiocytes become more prominent. These early histologic changes can mimic granuloma faciale and Sweet\u2019s syndrome. On the other hand, angiocentric fibrosis ranging from perivascular to storiform would be seen in older lesions [111]. The changes of the late-stage lesion can resemble a fibrous neoplasm such as sclerotic fibroma or inflammatory pseudotumor [ 111].",

Recognition of this form of PAN is important for prompt antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis.

A lobular granulomatous panniculitis with associated vasculitis was seen in 12% and mainly lobular panniculitis without associated vasculitis in 10%. The vasculitis can be neutrophilic, granulomatous, or lymphocytic depending on the stage of the disease. Neutrophils are prominent in the early stage, whereas histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells impart a granulomatous pattern in the established lesion. Large zones of caseous necrosis would be seen when there is much vascular damage. The accompanied lobular panniculitis distinguishes nodular vasculitis from cutaneous PAN. The primary location of the vasculitis in the panniculus separates nodular vasculitis from GPA and EGPA.",
