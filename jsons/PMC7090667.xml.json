            "text": "Infectious diseases are common in childhood. Acute respiratory tract infections are the most common cause with high mortality and complication rates. The most common agents for acute respiratory tract infection are viruses [1] and include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), influenza viruses (IFVs), enteroviruses (EVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. Coronaviruses NL63, HKU1 and human bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses are the other viruses that cause serious respiratory tract infections [2]. Although viruses are the most common causes of acute respiratory tract infections, main etiological diagnosis is often missed and unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic use is seen in more than 50 % of acute respiratory tract infections worldwide [3]. This leads to development of serious outcomes such as high resistance rates or multidrug resistance along with drug side effects in the children infected with virus [3, 4]. There are many pathogens causing similar clinical manifestations suggestive of acute respiratory tract infection [3]. Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) is the most frequent bacterial agent in the etiology of acute respiratory tract, accounting for 15\u201330 % of acute pharyngitis cases especially in the children [5]. Clinical manifestations of GAS respiratory tract infection are mostly presence of sore throat and fever and absence of cough [5]. Clinical manifestations like cough, nasal discharge, and diarrhea are more suggestive of viral causes [5]. Clinical differentiation between viral and bacterial etiology is important for performing appropriate laboratory test, treatment and follow-up. In the index study, the authors investigated clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of these two most common etiological causes seen in the children.",

While the ratio of the patients in whom the test was performed due to the complaint of cough was significantly less in >6 y age group; the ratio of the patients in whom the test was performed due to the complaint of headache was higher in >6 y age group. The authors found that the number of patients in whom the test was performed due to the complaint of sore throat were less in <2 y age group as compared to those in >6 y age group. The ratio of patients with positive RSA test and positive throat culture test was higher in >6 y age group. Also the ratio of patients with complaint of cough and sore throat were low and high respectively in the patients with positive RSA and positive throat culture test. GAS is seen frequently during the winter and spring months especially in 5\u201315 y age groups [8]. The number of patients with positive GAS tests were higher in the winter and spring months. While viruses are responsible for 95 % cases of sore throat in <5 y age children, they are responsible for 70 % cases of sore throat in 5\u201315 y age group. The most common bacterial cause of sore throat is GAS. One-third cause of sore throat in children 5\u201315 y of age is GAS [9]. Absence of cough, headache, myalgia, fever >38 \u00b0C has sensitivity of 51\u201379 %, 48 %, 49 % and 22\u201358 % respectively for GAS respiratory system infections [6]. The clinical presentations of GAS and viral acute respiratory system infections show considerable overlap and no single element of the patient\u2019s history or physical examination reliably confirms or excludes GAS acute respiratory system infection [6]. Most of the American authors suggest the necessity of microbiological confirmation for the diagnosis of GAS; clinical criteria can help a clinician to select patients who need to be tested [7].",
