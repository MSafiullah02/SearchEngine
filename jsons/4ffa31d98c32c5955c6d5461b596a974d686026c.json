The changes of body weight, Lee's index, body fat, and the expression of UCP1 gene of BAT in obese rats were observed before and after acupuncture. Results: The body weight, Lee's index, body fat in obese rats were all markedly higher than those in normal rats, but the expression of UCP, gene of BAT in obese rats was all lower than that in normal rats. There were negative correlation between the obesity index and the expression of UCP1 gene in BAT. After acupuncture the marked effect of weight loss was achieved while the expression of UCP: gene of BAT obviously increased in obese rats. Conclusion. The abnormal reduction for expression of UCPa gene of BAT might be an important cause for the obesity. To promote the expression of UCP~ in obese organism might be an important cellular and molecular mechanism in anti-obesity effect by acupuncture.",

There has been no breakthrough in treatment on obesity, and ideal non-toxic medicine without any adverse reaction is still under exploration. The author established an approach of acupuncture in treating obesity and its complications, the effect of which proved long-lasting, without any toxic and adverse reaction, and was welcomed by the vast obesity patients (1~.

UCP is a specific expressed mitochondria intimal protein of BAT, with its molecular weight as 32KD (7). The function of UCP is a transportation carrier of fatty acid ion which carries, from inside the mitochondria to outside mitochondria, the fatty acid ion that can not penetrate the mitochondria intima. The fatty acid ion outside the mitochondria would combine with H + and re-enter the mitochondria, and is again reoxidized to fatty acid ion. Such repetition would eliminate different concentration gradients on both sides of mitochondria intima induced by oxidation, so that ADP cannot be phosphorylated to generate ATP. The final results of respiratory and oxidized phosphorylation uncoupling would bring about the transformation of energy production to 9 207 9 heat production (8~. At present there have been discovered 3 kinds of UCP. UCP1, UCPz and UCP3. UCPI is the earliest discovered uncoupling protein, and in BAT expression in rodent animal, it is an important uncoupling protein of non-shivering heat production. UCP2 not only exists in BAT, but existed widely in various tissues and cells, including white adipose tissue, lung, liver, spleen and inside macrophage. UCP3 mainly exists in skeletal muscle, and also in BAT. Studies showed that UCPz and UCP3 are uncoupling protein with the same function as UCP1 (9.m It is well known that UCP gene expression level plays the deciding role in its own content and BAT heat production, which is called the center of BAT heat production. Heat production is closely related with energy balance, metabolism, and body weight regulation. The important protein participating in metabolism under normal physiologic status, most likely, also participates in the target protein of patho-physiologic metabolic disturbance, and therefore it is inferred that UCPs possibly are related with obesity pathogenesis.",

At the same time, obese patients plasma cAMP, thyroxin, corticosteroid, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and adrenoeorticotropic hormone content were all very low~ and serum LP and INS content abnormally raised. Animal experiments indicated that the obese rats' BAT cell volume increased, full, fatty drops large, mitochondria in the cytoplasm obviously reduced in size, mitochondria matrix density increased, the crista unable to be clearly displayed, and interstitial capillary decreased, showing that BAT heat production was abnormally decreased.",

At the same time the hypothalamic LP and INS content of obese rats were abnormally low, denoting that the LP blood brain transportation abnormality was likely to be one of the important factors of LR. Experiment showed that the number of RBC's insulin receptor (INSR) of high affinity and low volume and that of low affinity and high volume in obese rats was all decreased, but the dissociation constant in INSR of high or low affinity was abnormally elevated, which denoted that obese organisms' INSR abnormality and INS blood brain transportation abnormality were possibly one of the important factors of IR (1'16). The above-mentioned data showed that the abnormal lowering of obese organisms\" BAT UCPs gene expression level was possibly related with abovementioned regulating factors.",

To explore the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by integrative Chinese and western medicine (ICWM), for elevating the clinical therapeutic level of SARS. Methods: By adopting the randomized controlled method, the clinical efficacy of treatment of patients with SARS, hospitalized from April 10, 2003 to May 20, 2003 in Ditan Hospital, Beijing was evaluated. All the patients were treated by western medicine according to the therapeutic program recommended by the SARS Coordinating Group, the Chinese decoction for clearing heat and removing dampness was given additionally to the 35 patients in the treated group, but it was not given to the 30 patients in the control group. The therapeutic effect in the two groups was analyzed and compared. Results. The efficacy of treatment in the treated group was superior to that in the control group, in apects of promoting the absorption of pulmonarty inflammation and alleviating the inhibitory state of lymphocytes. Conclusion: Efficacy of SARS treatment with ICWM is better than that with western medicine alone.Original article on CJIM (Chin) 2003;23(7) * 492",
