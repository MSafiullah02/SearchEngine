He found that continuous innovation can be regarded as proceeding the technology paradigm, while discontinuous innovation might be the initiation of a new paradigm (Dosi, 1982). Methodologies have been proposed and applied by numerous researchers in various fields to understand the paradigm or dynamic development of the selected fields (Gupta & Bhattacharya, 2004). From literature publication metadata and information, it was evident that bibliometric analysis was the methodology used for mapping the evolution of knowledge.",

He also proposed a novel and intelligible technique called the Literature-Related Discovery method for linking two or more literature concepts together (Ding et al., 2001, Kostoff et al., 1998, Kostoff et al., 2002, Kostoff et al., 2005, Kostoff et al., 2007, Kostoff, 2008) mapped information retrieval research by using co-word analysis on papers collected from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) from 1987 until 1997 (Baldwin et al., 2003, Ding et al., 2001) mapped ethics and dementia research by using keywords (Baldwin et al., 2003, Tian et al., 2008) used the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database to measure scientific output in the field of Geographic Information System (GIS) by using keywords (Tian et al., 2008). Similar approaches have been made to map knowledge evolution in other fields, such as software engineering (Coulter, Monarch, & Konda, 1998), chemistry (Callon, Courtial, & Laville, 1991), scientometrics (Courtial, 1994), neural network research (Noyons and Van Raan, 1998, Van Raan and Tijssen, 1993), biological safety (Cambrosio, Limoges, Courtial, & Laville, 1993), optomechatronics (Noyons & van Raan, 1994), bioelectronics (Hinze, 1994), adverse drug reactions (Clarke et al., 2007, Rikken et al., 1995), biotechnology (De Looze and Lemari\u00e9, 1997, Rip and Courtial, 1984), environmental science (Ho, 2007), condensed matter physics (Bhattacharya & Basu, 1998), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), tsunamis (Chiu and Ho, 2007, Chiu et al., 2004), and Parkinson's disease (Li, Ho, & Li, 2008).",

Each resource exchange is a social network relation or a \u201ctie\u201d maintained by social actors at both ends of the \u201ctie.\u201d The strength of a tie is a function of the number of resource exchanges, the type of exchanges, the frequency of resource exchanges, or even how close the two connected actors are (Marsden & Campbell, 1984).",

            "text": "Social network analysis is an interdisciplinary research field. Granovetter, 1970, Granovetter, 1973 proposed the theory of the weak tie after his social network research. He surveyed a total of 282 job seekers with regard to the type of ties between the job seeker and the contact person who provided the necessary information. Of those who found jobs through personal contacts, only 16.7% reported seeing their contact person often. This illustrated that social network analysis is a proxy that provides a connection between microscopic analysis and macroscopic analysis. In the late 1990s, collaboration between researchers from different fields through the use of social network analysis had been initiated, and the field became more interdisciplinary. At that time, Barabasi and Albert (1999) demonstrated that the algebraic distribution in the connectivity of a scale-free network was caused by two basic factors in the temporal evolution of the network: growth and preferential attachment (Barabasi & Albert, 1999). Watts and Strogatz (1998) published a breakthrough paper titled \u201cCollective dynamics of \u2018small world\u2019 networks,\u201d (Watts & Strogatz, 1998), and a book titled \u201cSix Degrees: The Science of A Connected Age\u201d (Watts, 2003) which, together with other interdisciplinary works, contributed to the expansion of the \u201csmall world\u201d concept from conventional neuroscience and bioinformation systems to any natural or human system that can be modeled by a network.",

A total of 206 standardized keywords contained in 62 open innovation papers have been analyzed in this study, networks and contour maps are quantitatively and visually created to understand research structure of global open innovation community.",

The most highly centralized papers are published by Belgium Science Policy Office, Innsbruck University and University of London, which lead their countries to be highly centralized. Top 10 actors in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 are all from Europe and USA. The three countries outside of Europe and USA in the research community are Korea, Taiwan and China, this might be due to their fast-paced development contexts. The US has the most papers in the field of open innovation but is only ranked Nos. 6\u20137 in network centralities. This is not very common because the US is easily ranked as the top one country in terms of research performance evaluated by different bibliometric analysis, due to its large number of researchers and research activities in many fields. Europe seems to be the leader of global open innovation research. Taiwan, Korea and China are three Asian countries ranked Nos. 10\u201314 in different network centralities, this has to do with their face-paced research induced by economic growth.",

According to these obtained keywords, it can be derived that open innovation has a lot to do with idea, software and require consideration of technology transfer, intellectual property, commercialization.
