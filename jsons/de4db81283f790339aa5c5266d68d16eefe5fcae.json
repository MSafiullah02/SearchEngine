In fact, in Iran, the initial report, in addition to reporting two cases, also reported deaths. 4 Given that the incidence of these cases was unrelated to any direct source outside of Iran, and on the other hand, given the geographical location of the provinces where the Iranian Ministry of Health reported cases (central areas of the country), the probability of the epidemic situation of the disease could be considered.",

This was a prediction that came with the rapid spread of the disease throughout Iran in a short span. According to WHO statistics, at the end of March 9 and in less than three weeks after the first new case report in Iran, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran was more than 6500 and the total deaths from COVID-19 was 194. 5 In these situations, in addition to providing high-quality medical services to patients, there is a serious need for basic care, including education for the general public in various areas of prevention and related health care. In addition to considerations regarding the ability to manage the conditions ahead, given the wide scope of the issue across the country, the primary care system is important in identifying and correctly referring cases. The primary healthcare system in Iran has had a good standing over the past few years. The structure has, implemented many WHO and other public health programs, including the polio eradication program. 6 Over the past few years, the capacity of primary health care in Iran has been maintained at an acceptable level owing to the use of appropriate and efficient methods, and the WHO has reported significant progress in this area, even as a model for some countries. 7 But the important issue has been the shortage of resources in the health sector over the last few years, and especially in the last two years, owing to the numerous economic bottlenecks in Iran.",
