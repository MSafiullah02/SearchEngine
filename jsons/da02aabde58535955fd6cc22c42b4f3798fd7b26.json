Additionally, a previous study showed that replacing the RBD of the lineage B bat virus Rp3 allowed the virus to enter cells expressing human ACE2 16 . We therefore developed a method to functionally test the RBDs from lineage B betacoronaviruses in place of the SARS-CoV spike RBD (Fig. 1) . Synthesizing just the RBD of spike is much faster and cost effective than conventional pseudotyping methods that rely on the synthesis of the full spike sequence (~4 kilobases (kb)) for CoVs-a process that can take weeks and is cost prohibitive for large panels of spike sequences. The short turnaround time for our approach allowed us to test the receptor usage of all published, unique RBD sequences in lineage B, and to rapidly confirm the ACE2 receptor usage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, which emerged in China in January 2020 as our study was ongoing.",

All 29 RBDs were codon optimized, synthesized and cloned in place of the SARS RBD, generating chimeric spike expression constructs. We then produced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) reporter particles pseudotyped with the chimeric spikes (Fig. 1c) 17 . We chose VSV over lentiviruses as our pseudotype platform because lentiviral pseudotypes have failed to accurately reflect viral entry with bat coronavirus spike protein 7 . All constructs exhibited similar levels of expression in producer cells and incorporation into VSV pseudotypes, except the chimera with BM48-31, which displayed somewhat reduced expression compared with the wild-type SARS spike (Fig. 1d) . We then infected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the receptor for SARS-CoV or empty vector (Fig. 1e) and observed that only clade 1, which includes SARS-CoV, could enter cells transfected with human ACE2 (Fig. 1e) .",

To circumvent host-cell protease incompatibility or absence, we protease treated our pseudotype panel and infected a wide variety of cell types from different host species (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) . In the absence of exogenous protease, only clade 1 infected cells from African green monkey kidney, human gastrointestinal tract, human liver and porcine kidney, in agreement with previous studies. Surprisingly, exogenous protease enhanced entry of a subset of clade 2 spike chimeras in nonhuman primate, bat and human cells (Fig. 2) .

Only clade 1 RBDs contain all 14 residues that have been shown through crystallography to interact with human ACE2 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4 ). The majority of these residues are absent from clades 2 and 3, which contain additional deletions in surface-exposed loops that cluster at the interface with ACE2 ( Fig. 4a,b) . We generated a series of clade consensus RBD variants to determine the minimum number of mutations needed to impart ACE2 function on clade 2 and 3 RBDs (Fig. 4c) . Introducing the two loop deletions from clade 1 in clade 2 resulted in reduced spike expression, impaired pseudotype incorporation and loss of cell entry (Fig. 4c,d) . Restoring these loops in clades 2 and 3 from the loops found in clade 1 did not enhance entry with ACE2 Full spike and RBD chimeras are comparable.

All chimeric constructs expressed similarly, with the exception of the SARS-BM48-31 RBD chimera, which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (Figs. 1d and 5b). Protease treatment enhanced entry of both the As6526 clade 2 RBD chimera and full-length spike into Huh cells (Fig. 5c ). Protease treatment had no effect on either the BM48-31 clade 3 chimera or full-length spike (Fig. 5c ). Taken together, these findings show that SARS lineage B RBD chimeras reflect the entry phenotype of full-length lineage B spikes. Finally, we tested whether receptor binding and protease processing are coupled. We replaced the RBD of full-length clade 2 and 3 spike with the consensus clade 1 RBD and tested pseudotypes on cells expressing ACE2. The clade 1 consensus RBD efficiently facilitated entry of both As6526 and BM48-31 spike only following protease treatment. These findings show that even though BHK cells expressing human ACE2 cells support full-length clade 1 spike entry, just having the RBD from a clade 1 virus was insufficient to mediate efficient entry. As seen in our previous experiments, protease treatment did not enhance pseudotype entry in the absence of host receptor (Fig. 5 ).",

To gain traction on this ever-growing problem, we took a reductionist approach to coronavirus entry and developed a scalable, biosafety level 2-compatible method for testing only the minimal region of the virus essential for interacting with the host receptor ( Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1a) . Because most of these viruses have never been isolated, we resorted to synthetic biology and molecular engineering to reduce the burden of gene synthesis to just a small fragment. Thus, the cost and synthesis production time for testing several spikes for entry in our system is dramatically reduced (Extended Data Fig. 1d ). In theory, this approach to functional viromics should be applicable to a wide variety of virus-host proteins and interactions.",

            "text": "Coronavirus entry is a multi-step process involving several distinct domains in spike that mediate virus attachment to the cell surface, receptor engagement, protease processing and membrane fusion 8 . While the RBD-receptor interaction is the most studied in this process, recent studies have highlighted the major role host protease processing plays as a species barrier 19, [22] [23] [24] . Lineage C coronaviruses include MERS-CoV as well as distantly related viruses such as HKU4, HKU5 and PDF-2180 (refs. 25, 26 ) . Studies have shown that HKU4 can bind human DPP4 but requires the addition of exogenous trypsin to facilitate cell entry, and that HKU5 and PDF-2180 spikes can enter human cells through an unidentified receptor with protease treatment 19, 23 . Analogous to these lineage C CoV studies, we observed protease-enhanced entry of lineage B CoVs (Figs. 2, 3 and 5). While it has been shown that host proteases cleave spike, allowing for downstream membrane fusion, other evidence suggests that protease may act on the receptor as well to activate it 27 . The addition of protease during the course of SARS-CoV infection facilitated entry in cells with low expression of ACE2 (normally insufficient to support virus entry) 27 . Indeed, we saw evidence of residual trypsin activity on the cells after infection in our studies, as the cell monolayer was loose compared with the untreated condition. Similarly, Menachery et al. 23 also observed cell rounding during their trypsin infections. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess where trypsin is enhancing entry of coronaviruses: at the level of spike, the receptor, or both.",

Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing human ACE2 without the addition of protease, but clade 2-clade 1 chimeras require protease, our data show that the spike protease cleavage site may be adapted to the protease environment of the receptorbound RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5) . None of the spike pseudotypes efficiently entered Rhinolophus cells, as was observed in previous studies using these cells 29, 30 (Fig. 2c) . Surprisingly, AJi cells were selectively permissive for only clade 2 entry following protease treatment, which suggests that clade 2 RBDs interact with a receptor that is distinct from clade 1 (Fig. 2c) . Unfortunately, a common problem with studies assessing viral entry in cell types from different species is accurately measuring surface protein expression of the receptor through conventional methods such as flow cytometry. We have previously shown that DPP4 from different species crossreacts differently with the same DPP4 antibody, confounding correlations between receptor expression level and entry 31 .",

While our study was ongoing, a lineage B betacoronavirus was identified as the etiological agent behind an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China (SARS-CoV-2). The RBD for SARS-CoV-2 has residues and motifs found in all three clades but forms a distinct clade, so we tested it for receptor usage and observed entry of human ACE2 but not other known coronavirus receptors (Fig. 3d) . Interestingly, within the backbone of SARS-CoV spike, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the other clade 1 spikes tested, including SARS-CoV. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using human ACE2 as efficiently, if not more, as SARS-CoV, which may help to explain the human-to-human transmissibility of this virus. Our finding that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 has now been confirmed with the full virus and a computer modellingbased approach 32, 33 .",

Coronaviruses frequently undergo recombination, gaining large swaths of genetic material at once 34, 35 . Taken together with our data, it is possible that recombination with a clade 1 virus will impart compatibility with human ACE2. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD contains most of the contact points with human ACE2 that are found in clade 1, as well as some amino acid variations that are unique to clades 2 and 3 (Extended Data Fig. 4b ). Taken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that SARS-CoV-2 arose from recombination between clade 1 and the other clades.",

While clade 2 RBDs can bind an unknown host receptor, the SARS spike backbone is incompatible with the receptor-associated protease, resulting in a lack of cleavage and entry (middle panel). The addition of exogenous protease may overcome the lack of endogenous protease cleavage of spike, resulting in receptor-dependent entry. Alternatively, the addition of exogenous protease may activate the receptor to facilitate entry. b, Replacing the RBD of As6526 spike with the clade 1 RBD allows for ACE2 interaction, but the As6526 spike backbone is incompatible with the ACE2-associated protease (left panel). Addition of exogenous protease overcomes protease incompatibility, allowing for ACE2-mediate entry (right panel).",
