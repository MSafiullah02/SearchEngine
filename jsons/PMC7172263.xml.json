EM is indispensable in situations where the etiological agent causing outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics is difficult to identify. Recently, there have been two examples, namely the SARS pandemic in 2003 (Ksiazek et al., 2003) and the outbreak of human monkeypox in the USA in 2003, an infection not seen previously outside the African continent (Reed et al., 2004). In both of these situations, EM contributed to the identification of the viral agent. After 11th September 2001, EM has also been adopted in many countries as a rapid screening method to be used for the examination of both environmental and human samples in the case of bioterrorism (Gelderblom, 2003, Miller, 2004).",

The results are shown in Fig. 2\n. One sample each of cell propagated adenovirus and influenza A virus, respectively, was extracted directly using MagnaPure extraction and then subjected to nucleic acid amplification (unprocessed sample). In addition, two samples (1x\n + EM) were subjected to EM examination prior to MagnaPure extraction and nucleic acid amplification as shown in Fig. 1. A quantitative real-time assay was used for adenovirus (Fig. 2A), using the standard curve to calculate the average loss of viral copies per ml for the processed (1x\n + EM) sample relative to the unprocessed sample, according to the formula (Ctintercept\n \u2212 Ctsample/slope) \u00d7 inv. log. The difference was estimated to be a 38-fold loss of sensitivity i.e. from 2.3 \u00d7 108\n copies/ml (Ct = 17.49) to 6 \u00d7 106\n copies/ml (Ct = 23.20). This corresponded to 5.71 PCR cycles. From the Ct value of the highest dilution (100x\n + EM, Ct = 32.34) it could then be calculated, that 6.84 \u00d7 105\n copies/ml of adenovirus could be detected by EM and this corresponded to 6.84 \u00d7 105/38 = 1.8 \u00d7 104\n copies/ml as detected by PCR. Although influenza A virus (Fig. 2B) was detected using a non-quantitative assay, the loss in PCR cycles (Ctsample\n \u2212 Ctunprocessed sample\n = 17.79 \u2212 12.15) could be measured to be 5.64 which was in good agreement with the result estimated with the adenovirus assay.",

The decrease in viral copies could be due to a percentage of the viruses remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation onto the grids or that part of the viruses were not visible by EM after centrifugation onto the grid, due to the viruses adhering to the copper mesh or due to some degradation of nucleic acids during the sample preparation. As estimated for adenovirus it could, however, be compensated for by the higher sensitivity of the PCR technique and therefore has no negative impact on the results.",

            "text": "The EM technique has been used occasionally in parallel with other virological methods to identify the causative viral agent in patients during outbreaks of zoonotic origin and during seasonal and out-of-season epidemics and pandemics. For instance, in one case report, reovirus-like particles were found by EM in rhesus monkey kidney cells inoculated with cerebrospinal fluid from a young patient, and further investigations confirmed the diagnosis reovirus serotype 2 (Hermann et al., 2004). The same approach was used to diagnose Chandipura virus causing an outbreak of acute encephalitis with a high fatality rate in children from India (Rao et al., 2004). The etiological agent involved in a zoonotic outbreak in a rural area of Brasil causing cowpox-like symptoms in a dairy herd, and an associated human infection, was resolved partly with the aid of EM and was found to be a vaccinia-like virus, which was named Aracatuba virus (Trinidade et al., 2003). The peak of rotavirus infections in children during the winter in Japan was found to have changed to early spring by confirming the rotavirus diagnosis in parallel with EM and the latex agglutination method (Suzuki et al., 2005). In recent years, noroviruses have become a major problem in hospitals worldwide, causing outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis (reviewed by Clark and McKendrick, 2004). The high diversity of this group of viruses leads sometimes to the failure of detection by conventional routine diagnostic RT-PCR assays. The use of EM as an additional method can in this instance be essential (Gallimore et al., 2004, Vipond et al., 2004). Finally, the recent pandemic caused by SARS was also resolved partly by EM (Ksiazek et al., 2003).",
