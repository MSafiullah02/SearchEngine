In many cases, as with sections of this meeting, the questions or observations are 25-30 years old, such as the seminal studies by Dr William R Beisel and his colleagues at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. This series of studies documented the relatively constant constellation of metabolic, physiological and endocrinological changes which occur during bacterial, viral and rickettsial diseases in humans and other species. The wisdom of the ancient Greeks also was demonstrated at this conference: the virtues of a sound mind in a sound body.",

As some of the consequences of such interactions he cited: pituitary-adrenal activation; inappropriate ADH secretion; sick euthyroid syndrome; sick hypogonadal syndrome; sick bone syndrome; impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance; and sick brain syndrome, also known as sickness behaviour. In every case there is growing evidence of endocrine-cytokine interactions. Moreover, these interactions between cytokines and neurohormones may elicit adverse neurological side-effects when cytokines are given therapeutically. For example, in a 1987 study of 44 patients given IL-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells, 5 patients developed moderate cognitive impairment, 22 displayed delirium and severe cognitive impairment, while 7 exhibited delusions, escape behaviour and picking at their bedclothes (the last a condition which Dr Reichlin noted was described by Galen and is often found in the severely ill). Interferon-a. treatment of hepatitis C also is generally accompanied by fever, chills and fatigue, ebut in 17% of cases evokes serious brain dysfunction to include suicidal tendencies.",

Dr Langman made an impassioned plea to begin collecting the data on cytokine and neuroendocrine effects and interactions in a central location so the information can be processed and integrated into a 'consensus model of neuroendocrine immunology'. He volunteered to be the contact person to begin collecting data on the ligands, the receptors and the cell types, as well as on the biological actions of, and physiological responses to, hormones and cytokines. Some in the audience thought that this would be an insurmountable task unlikely to yield much information about a complex system; however as recta-analysis has shown, computer systems can often fred patterns in multiple sets of data that rriay not be apparent from individual studies.",

In addition to being hazardous, war and the training for war is stressful. To assess the effects of such stresses on the endocrine-immune system(s) 300 Ranger trainees were studied over a period of 8 weeks during the desert, mountain, forest and swamp phases of their training. On average these healthy individuals lost 9-10% of their body weight, virtually all as fat, had 3-4 hours of sleep per day, operated at a high level of activity, and were subjected to a wide variety of stresses such as might occur in battle. By the end of the 4th week, at the completion of the mountain phase of training which was the most strenuous phase, serum cortisol levels increased while those of testosterone and IGF-1 decreased. At this time, the skin test to an array of antigens was 40% of normal while 20% of the trainees were anergic. The skin test response correlated with testosterone levels. While T cell function was decreased, IgE levels were increased. White cell secretion of IL-la, IL-6 and TNFa in response to endotoxin was decreased. Attempts to eliminate these alterations in the neuroimmune responses by increasing food intake yielded equivocal results.",

The elevated plasma corticosterone levels correlated with reduced lymphocyte trafficking to the lungs and to the draining lymph nodes of the infected mice.

IL-la and fl, TNFa and /~, interferon-a, and acidic fibroblast growth factor all enhance sleep whether given intravenously or intracerebroventricularly. The effect of these cytokines appears not to be limited to illness-associated sleep changes. Antibodies to IL-1/~ or to TNFa, as well as a soluble TNF receptor and IL-lra reduce normal sleep. The mechanisms by which cytokines elicit sleep do not appear to involve prostaglandins, opioids or insulin, but may be mediated by growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Growth hormone release is linked to SWS and GHRH is somnogenic in rats, rabbits and man. Antibodies to GHRH block IL-l-induced growth hormone release and IL-l-induced sleep responses. Nitric oxide (NO) is also somehow involved; GHRH and IL-1 enhance NO production, while inhibition of NO production blocks IL-l-induced sleep.",

He indicated that the neuroendocrine and the immune systems share many of the same ligands and receptors. For example, lymphocytes have been shown to produce ACTH, prolactin, TSH, endorphins and growth hormone; in fact growth hormone appears to act as autocrine regulator in lymphocytes. Conversely, the pituitary has a receptor for IL-1 and IL-1 can act directly to induce CRF which stimulates ACTH release. CRF also sensitizes the pituitary so that subsequent exposure to IL-1 causes a persistent ACTH release. Such sensitization might allow a series of mild inflammatory stresses to produce a disproportionate glucocorticoid response. Dr Blalock also briefly discussed a pituitary-derived factor called 'suppressin' which appears to block the blastogenic response and, in preliminary studies, to inhibit lymphoid tumour growth.",

As an antidote, Dr James Lipton (University of Texas SW Medical Center, Dallas, TX) discussed a-MSH which appears to be following IL-1 into the pantheon of virtually uniquitous endogenous mediators, which may be appropriate considering the range of its potent anti-inflammatory activities, a-MSH is found in many areas throughout the brain and body, with large amounts found in the skin and gut. a-MSH has been shown to moderate acute inflammation induced by irritants and cytokines; the delayed hypersensitivity reaction; chronic inflammation (mycobacterium arthritis); and systemic inflammation associated with endotoxaemia, sepsis, peritonitis and adult respiratory distress (ARDS). In a caecal ligation model of peritonitis which is uniformly fatal, a-MSH increases survival to 40% and acts additively with gentamicin to attain 70% survival. In ARDS, a-MSH inhibits neutrophil migration and accumulation of neutrophils in the bronchi, a-MSH may exert its anti-inflammatory actions by its ability to inhibit nitric oxide production by macrophages. Dr Lipton proposed an interesting inflammo-modulatory cycle based on the fact that macrophages both produce and have receptors for a-MSH while neutrophils appear to have only receptors for a-MSH thus, in macrophages a-MSH could act as an autocrine. Since macrophages succeed neutrophils at wound sites one wonders if this difference between macrophages and neutrophils allows for a non-specific inflammatory response, which could be destructive if unchecked, to be converted into a controlled healing response.",

A GFAP expression vector was used to target astrocytes in the CNS for the expression of IL-6, IL-3 or IFN-a. Cerebral expression of each of these cytokines at high levels led to an early death. Expression at low levels was associated with a progressive neuropathy, but allowed time for development of breeding lines. All cytokines caused neurodegeneration and astrocytosis. IL-6 alone caused demyelination, angiogenesis, diffuse blood-brain barrier leakage and upregulation of acute-phase protein synthesis as well as increased deposition of these proteins. IL-3 alone caused menigoencephalitis; both IL-3 and IL-6 caused perivascular cuffing and microgliosis. IFN alone caused induction of MHC class I and 2,5-oligoadenylate synthase gene expression. Whether or not such transgenic animals can be developed into models for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases remains to be determined, but it is clear that chronic expression of cytokines in the CNS produces many of the changes associated with such diseases.",

HPLC of the radioactivity extracted from brain tissue confirmed that intact cytokine had crossed the BBB; radioactivity that was acid precipitable was also recovered from cerebrospinal fluid. Capillary depletion showed that the majority of cytokine taken up by brain completely penetrated the capillary bed that comprises the BBB to reach the brain's parenchyma and interstitial fluid. The percentage of the iv injection that entered the brain peaked at about 0.33%/g of brain 30 min after injection. This is about 4-5 times higher than the percentage of art iv injection accumulating in the brain for IL-la. This suggests that, in experimental designs or therapeutic manoeuvres that give IL-lc~ and RA simultaneously, the RA/IL-la ratio would be higher behind the BBB than in the periphery and CVOs, leading to a relatively greater blockade of central receptors.",

Although previous studies have found IL-la and IL-lfl to be effective self-and cross-inhibitors at about the 10-20/zg/kg dosage range, the current data suggests that the relationship with RA is quite different. The ability to inhibit RA even better than itself suggests that IL-1B at high blood levels would tend to decrease the RA/IL-1B ratio in the CNS relative to the peripheral ratio. In contrast, increasing blood levels of IL-la, even at levels that would be inhibiting IL-la entry, would have little effect on RA entry; this would tend towards higher RA/IL-la ratios.",

The relationship between stress and susceptibility to infectious diseases has been the subject of increasing discussion and research, although animal studies in this area date to the time of Louis Pasteur. The Army Ranger School is a rigorous infantry leadership course designed to mimic the psychological and physical stressors inherent in infantry combat missions. Outbreaks of infectious diseases are recurrent problems in stressed populations such as military trainees, military combatants, and refugees. The Ranger School was used as a model for such stressors, and this study examined sleep, neuroendocrine responses, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin-test responses, and antibody responses to polysaccharide and protein recall antigens. The study utilized a repeated measures design, obtaining data on ranger trainees prior to the course, and after 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Data was collected on two cohorts, totalling 112 subjects, in 1991 and 1992. During the first study trainees were immunized with diphtheria-conjugated Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine at the course mid-point, and their responses to both antigens compared with those of a control group. DTH testing utilized a standard 7-antigen multiple fine-test device. Sleep and activity were documented continually by wrist-worn activity monitors. Saliva and 0700 blood samples were collected for neuroendocrine and cytokine measurement.",

A commonality of ligands and receptors would seem to represent the molecular mechanism of such cross-talk. Thus, the immune system is now recognized as a source of neuropeptides and their receptors, while eytokines and their receptors are found within the CNS. Furthermore, regardless of the system, the same secondary messenger molecules can be generated as a result of a particular ligand/reeeptor interaction. Therefore, discrimination between functional responses would seem in part to reside in how a certain cell type is genetically programmed to respond. In addition, subtle differences in transcriptional regulation and post-translational modification of the neuropeptides and cytokines may contribute to differential responsivity of the immune and neuroendocrine systems. Physiologically, these findings suggest that the immune system functions as a sensory organ for stimuli not recognized by the CNS. Indeed, immune system initiation of stress responses as well as local antinociception through lymphocyte-derived endorphins support this view. On the other hand, the association of certain animal models of autoimmune disease with hypothalamic disorders suggests an immunoregulatory capacity for the CNS. A complete understanding of this circuitry holds great promise for understanding and treating human neuroimmunological disorders.",

This data suggests that apoptosis in thymocytes is mediated by a CGRP receptor not sensitive to the antagonist.

At 8 h, corticosterone (10 -7 tool/L) induces rapid apoptosis in thymocytes but had no effect on reversing apoptosis or suppression of cell proliferation induced by CGRP (10 -8 mol/L) induces rapid apoptosis in thymocytes but had no effect on reversing apoptosis or suppression of cell proliferation induced by CGRP (10 -8 mol/L) either in the presence or absence of Con A. At 24 and 48 h, the amount of apoptosis induce by either CGRP or corticosterone were similar suggesting that the same population of cells (the CD4/CD8 double positive) are affected by these naturally occurring molecules. The necessity for these two means of apoptotic induction to coexist in the thymus remains unclear. However, a better understanding of stress, circadian rhythms and peptide release mechanisms may shed light on apoptotic function of these molecules. Cytokines are potent biological response modifiers that exhibit a spectrum of cellular actions. These factors have been implicated as important mediators of physiological and possibly pathophysiological processes within the CNS. Consistent with the notion that cytokines may contribute to tissue injury in CNS disease, altered neural expression of various cytokine genes has been observed in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including MS, HIV encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease and spongiform encephalopathy. We wished to evaluate the neurological consequences of the prolonged CNS expression of cytokines. To accomplish this, a GFAP expression vector was employed that targeted the expression of the cytokines IL-6, IL-3 or IFN-c~ to astrocytes in the CNS of transgenic mice. Cerebral expression of each of these cytokines at high levels produced mice with severe clinical features (e.g. runting, reduced activity, ataxia and seizures) and was invariably associated with early death. On the other hand, expression at low levels was associated with the onset at a later age of progressive neuropathy and allowed the development of breeding lines for further evaluation. In these animals diverse and extensive cellular and molecular neuropathologic changes were observed and included neurodegeneration (all), demyelination (IL-6), perivascular cuffing (IL-6 and IL-3), meningoencephalitis (IL-3), astrocytosis (IL-6, IL-3 and IFN), microgliosis (IL-6 and IL-3), angiogenesis (IL-6), diffuse blood-brain barrier leakage (IL-6), upregulated acute-phase protein synthesis and deposition (IL-6) and induction of MHC class I and 2,5-oligoadenylate synthase gene expression (IFN). We conclude that: (1) transgenic expression of the cytokines IL-6, IL-3 and IFN-a in the CNS results in the development of acute (high expression) or chronic progressive (low expression) CNS disease associated with a spectrum of clinical, physiological and pathological manifestations, (2) although the clinical, cellular and molecular phenotype produced by the cerebral expression of the various cytokines showed some overlap, the differences were more prominent, reflecting the unique actions of each cytokine, (3) these transgenic models recapitulate many of the structural and functional impairments seen in human neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, our studies indicate that cytokines, which normally function as primary regulators of the host response, also have the potential to mediate significant injury in the CNS, (4) these transgenic models offer not only a valuable tool for further understanding the CNS pathobiology of cytokines but also provides a unique resource for the development and testing of therapies aimed at abrogating the toxic actions of these important mediators.",

One subgroup of conditioned mice was re-exposed to the CS; a second subgroup was exposed to a booster injection of an amount of KLH (0.5 ng) that was, by itself, too small to elicit a significant antibody response: a third group received the CS plus 0.5 ng KLH; and a fourth subgroup received an immunogenic concentration of 50 ng KLH as a positive control. The 0.5 ng KLH boost ensured that a stimulus salient for the immune system was available to trigger the immune system since it seemed highly unlikely that a CS should stimulate antibody production by itself. Mice that received the CS together with the booster immunization made significantly more IgG anti-KLH antibody than the groups of conditioned animals that received either CS alone or the booster injection in the absence of the CS. Indeed, the antibody response of the animals that received the 0.5 ng KLH boost plus the CS was virtually identical to that of conditioned animals that had received 100-fold more antigen (i.e. the positive control group). Critical documentation that the antibody response in the subgroup that received the 0.5 ng KLH boost plus the CS was indeed a conditioned response, was provided by the observation that antibody titres in an additional group of mice that had been pre-exposed to the CS prior to the onset of the conditioning trials, did not differ from conditioned animals that received a booster injection in the absence of the CS.",

As for many regulatory processes there appear to be multiple factors that influence the regulated body temperature during fever -some raise the thermoregulatory set-point and others prevent the set-point from rising too high. The former are called 'endogenous pyrogens', and the latter 'endogenous antipyretics' or 'endogenous cryogens'.

            "text": "We believe that there are sufficient data to support the renaming of 'stress-induced hyperthermia' to 'stress-induced fever'. The precise pathways between contact with a pathogen or exposure to a psychologically stressful situation are not identical. However, there is considerable evidence indicating that stress-induced rises in body temperature are regulated, thus fulfilling the necessary criterion for this phenomenon to be called a fever (Kluger, 1991) . In addition, data will be presented that indicate that the stress hormones, corticosterone and epinephrine, stimulate the release of the cytokines from the liver. Infusion of physiological levels of eorticosterone into an isolated perfused rat liver resuked in increases in TNF and IL-6 in the effluent solution. Infusion of epinephrine led to a rise in IL-6 from the IPRL (Liao et al., 1994) . The general response is characterized by an initial period of enhanced sleep; this is followed 6-48 h later by a period of reduced sleep. Bacterial products probably responsible for sleep and fever include muramyl peptides and endotoxin. Viral double-stranded (ds)RNA also induces sleep and fever in animal models. The exact mechanisms of how these structurally diverse microbial products elicit sleep and fever remain unknown, although these substances share the ability to enhance cytokine production. Several cytokines are somnogenic whether given intravenously (iv) or intracerebroventricularly (icv); the list includes interleukin-1 (IL-1)ct and B, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) a and/~, interferon-a (IFN-a) and acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). Other cytokines, basic FGF, IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-B do not affect sleep although IL-6 is pyrogenic. The major effect of cytokines is to increase the duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS). The intensity of SWS is also increased as evidenced by enhanced amplitudes of EEG slow waves. Similar supranormal slow waves occur after sleep deprivation. Typically, after cytokine administration, excess SWS is observed for 2-10 h depending upon dose and route of administration, e.g. rabbits normally sleep about 45% of the time between 9.00 am and 3.00 pro; after a 20-ng dose of IL-IB, SWS will occupy about 65% of this time. In contrast to SWS, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is inhibited by high, but not low, somnogenic doses. Sleep and fever responses to cytokines can be separated, e.g. low doses of IL-1 elicit sleep but not fever in rats and antipyretics block IL-l-induced fevers but not sleep. There is also evidence that cytokines have a role in physiological sleep, thus, antibodies to IL-1/~ or TNFa, a soluble TNF receptor or the IL-1 receptor antagonist reduce normal sleep. Further, anti-IL-lB attenuates sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. The mechanisms by which cytokines elicit sleep remain unknown. The somnogenic actions of IL-1 are independent from prostaglandins, opioids and insulin. In contrast, corticotropin-releasing hormone, a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH) and inhibition of NO production block IL-1B sleep. Finally, infection, endotoxin, IL-1 and TNF induce growth hormone (GH) release, probably via GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). GH release is linked to SWS and GHRH is somnogenic in rats, rabbits and man. Anti-GHRH blocks IL-l-induced GH release and IL-l-induced sleep and fever responses. In conclusion, cytokines are probably key mediators of sleep and fever responses to infection. This microbial-cytokine-altered sleep probably results from an amplification of physiological sleep mechanisms which include cytokines and several neuropeptides.",

Instead of parasites and their hosts slowly evolving in isolated 'ponds', the highly mobile vertebrates were exposed to many different infectious environments during a single life time. Thus, instead of the usual slow evolution of germline-encoded recognition of bacteria and viruses, vertebrates developed a means of distinguishing self from non-self on a somatic time scale. This radically new mechanism of recognition of parasites allowed the evolution of even more destructive levels of effector function as this destruction could be specifically and locally delivered. The need to make an effective self-non-self discrimination essentially forces the separation of recognitive events and the destructive effector events needed to protect against lethal infection. For the purpose of analysing neuroendocrine reactions in the immune system, it is logical to clearly separate the antigen-specific events from the antigen-non-specific components, which are essentially common to all multicellular animals. In principle, neuroendocrine intervention could take place at the antigen-specific level or the antigen-non-specific level, although, at the antigen-specific level, intervention would have to be functionally non-specific. Thus, given that antigen-specific immune events can result in a wide variety of effector reactions, it seems inevitable that neuroendocrine intervention will be restricted to particular effector pathways. Here neuroendocrine effects could range from influencing the type of effector function the immune response will promote, to modulating the intensity of a class of effector functions, especially those functions that are common to non-specific effector functions.",

To make a cellular automata type of model it is important to characterize ligands and receptors in terms of molar concentrations and binding constants, and to think of switches that are on/off or are like volume controls. It will also be important to consider the effects of combinatorial sets of ligand receptor interactions in the control of the cellular responses that are so diverse when the ligand/receptor pairs available to regulate these responses are relatively few. a-MSH is a tridecapeptide derived from pro-opiomelanocortin. It occurs in widespread regions of the brain and body; barriers to the external environment (skin, gut) are known to contain a-MSH. Specific receptors for this molecule, melanocortin receptors, have recently been identified and cloned. In addition to its antipyretic effect, a-MSH has potent anti-inflammatory influences. This peptide is effective in all major forms of experimental inflammation: acute inflammation induced by irritants or by eytokines and other inflammatory mediators; delayed hypersensitivity reaction; chronic inflammation; systemic inflammation (endotoxaemia, peritonitis, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome). Results obtained with animal models further suggest that the peptide exerts its anti-inflammatory effect via actions both within the CNS and in the periphery. Observations on patients indicate that the peptide has a physiological role in modulation of inflammatory reactions: there are clear differences in cc-MSH in certain AIDS patients, in patients with arthritis, and in patients with cardiac ischaemia undergoing thrombolysis. It appears that the peptide becomes available to modulate local and systemic inflammatory reactions in humans. The mechanism of such actions of the peptide is likely to involve inhibition of production/action of proinflammatory cytokines and/or inhibition of another mediator that is common to all forms of inflammation. These possibilities are being explored using in-vitro tests of stimulated cultured peripheral cells and molecular biology techniques. The results to date are consistent with modulation by the peptide of responses of peripheral host cells via its action on specific peptide receptors. Adrenal steroids exert both positive and negative effects on the immune system. Their main effects include the regulation of apoptosis of immature thymus lymphocytes as part of the T cell selection process, the switching of class of an immune response by enhancing humoral immunity and suppressing cellular immunity, inhibition of inflammatory and autoimmune responses, and modulation of immune cell movement between the blood and various tissue compartments ('trafficking'). This presentation will deal primarily with the distribution of adrenal steroid receptor types and the role of adrenal steroids in immune cell 'trafficking'.",

Access to the target tissue is regulated by tissue factors that include corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and steroid catabolizing enzymes such as 11fl-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD). Synthetic steroids such as dexamethasone bypass these protective mechanisms and gain ready access to spleen and thymus type II receptors, whereas the natural glucoeorticoid, cortieosterone, is limited in its access to these tissues. As a result, patterns of type I and type II receptor occupancy differ as a function of the time of day (diurnal variation of corticosterone) and presence or absence of a stress response. These findings help to explain functional immune data indicating that the spleen is a protected site with regard to access by endogenous glucoeorticoids but is not protected with regard to access by dexamethasone.

The decrease of B cells levels is particularly striking and appears to be almost completely dependent on circulating corticosterone, whereas there appear to be extra-adrenal influences on the trafficking of other immune cell types in addition to the effect of corticosterone. Acute administration of corticosterone to adrenalectomized animals results in a close replication of the stress-induced changes observed in adrenal intact animals. Acute administration of the type II receptor agonist, Ru28362, replicates the stress-induced changes in blood leukocyte numbers, whereas the type I receptor agonist, aldosterone, reverses a stress-induced increase in leukocyte numbers observed in adrenalectomized animals.",

Current experiments are underway to assess whether 'trafficking' represents a means of providing immune cells to parts of the body undergoing challenge by various antigens including cancer cells and viral or bacterial pathogens. Nested, deletion mutants from the gp160 amino terminus representing folded, glycosylated, serially truncated recombinant envelope proteins were expressed in eukaryotic cells via a vaccinia virus vector (vPE). These proteins and linear gp120/gp41 peptides as well as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies reactive to defined regions of gp120/gp41 were used to map the epitopes involved in production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) in rodent glial cell cultures. A full-length env protein containing both gpl20 and gp41 (vPE16) induced both IL-1 and TNFa. vPE16 induced IL-1 in-vitro for a longer period of time and at lower concentrations than were required to induce TNFa. Both the V4 loop to C5 region of the carboxy terminus of gp120 as well as the gp41 protein were critical in TNFa production. V1-3 and C1-3 of gp120 were not important in TNFa production. The V3 loop of gpl20 appeared to be critical for IL-1 while V1, V2, V4, V5, and C1-5 domains of gp120 and gp41 were not important. Synthetic peptides representing linear epitopes in the V3 loop and C5 domain of gp120, and the ectodomain of gp41 were all strong inducers of TNFc~, although a protein representing almost the entire gp41 was the strongest inducer of TNFc~. Linear peptides in the region from the V4 loop to the C4 domain were strong inducers of IL-1. IL-1 and TNFa production were induced by different epitopes in gp160. The strength of the induction varied depending on whether the epitopes were conformational or linear determinates. Cytokine induction by env protein occurred at the messenger RNA level as determined by Northern blot analysis. Virus infection, therefore, is not required for the induction of these two cytokines and gpl60 epitopes other than the classical CD4 binding domain are involved. It is expected that cell surface receptors other than CD4 interact with gpl60 epitopes to produce IL-1 and TNFc~ from the glial cells. These data suggest envelope proteins in intact as well as degraded HIV-1 virions could induce proinflammatory cytokines which are possibly important in CNS AIDS.",

In addition to direct effects of circulating and intrinsic inflammatory cytokines on endocrine glands, many of the interleukins act in the central nervous system altering neuropsychological and hypothalamic-pituitary function. In addition to causing fever, cytokines produced within the brain, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNFa, and IFN, cause cognitive dysfunction, disorientation, and delirium. Peripheral or central administration of bacterial toxin, interleukins 1, 2, 6, and TNFa activate central CR neuronal systems, and alter the secretion of CNSneurotransmitters. Among the neurotransmitters which are stimulated are catecholamines, NO, GHRH, CCK, and somatostatin. Release and/or synthesis of acetylcholine, GNRH and TRH are inhibited. Synthesis of the neurotoxin substance, Alzheimer precursor peptide, is also enhanced. Central changes in neuroendocrine function caused by inflammation lead to activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis, inhibition of pituitary-thyroid function ('sick euthyroid syndrome'), inhibition of pituitary-gonad function ('sick hypogonadal syndrome') and release of vasopressin (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, SIADH). In each of these disorders, altered hypothalamic activity causes either excess secretion, or inhibits appropriate feedback responses. Though not specifically neuroendocrine, inflammatory cytokines adversely affect bone synthesis and inhibit pancreatic islet function.",

The stimulatory influence of cytokines on corticosteroid secretion is important in making available energy resources necessary to the increased metabolism of organisms exposed to pathogens, and in maintaining cytokine production within acceptable limits. In addition, ACTH exerts direct effects on immune cells, a phenomenon that is probably important during exposure to immune signals. It follows that circumstances that disrupt the cross-talk between the two systems mentioned above can lead to abnormal immune and/or endocrine responses. For example drugs such as alcohol (EtOH) are known to increase the incidence of immune-related diseases, and may do so in part by altering the normal interaction between the immune system and the HPA axis. Our studies were therefore designed, first to understand the physiological role played by immune proteins in mediating the response of the HPA axis to infection or inflammation, and second to investigate the influence of EtOH on cytokine-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion.",

Specifically, we investigated the role played by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), vasopressin (VP) and nitric oxide (NO) in mediating the release of ACTH by cytokines such as interleukin-1/~ (IL-lfl), and studied their role during IL-induced activation of the HPA axis in rats exposed to EtOH. CRF represents a crucial modulator of ACTH released by both IL-1/~ and EtOH, as indicated by the decrease in plasma ACTH levels in the absence of endogenous CRF. The acute influence of systemic IL-lfl on the HPA axis is probably mediated at the level of nerve terminals rather than within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, whereas this latter structure plays an important role during prolonged activation of the HPA axis by blood-borne cytokines as well as following the intracerebroventricular (icv) delivery of II~-l. VP is released by IL-1/e, and plasma levels of this peptide are elevated shortly after EtOH exposure. Peripheral IL-1 administration does not increase PVN VP gene expression, while icv delivery does. A role for endogenous VP in the HPA axis response to the central, but not systemic injection of IL-1 is further provided by the finding that VP immunoneutralization blunts ACTH secretion in response to the icv but not iv injection of the cytokine. VP also participates in the response of the HPA axis to EtOH. Indeed a single EtOH injection increases VP mRNA levels in the PVN, and ACTH levels of rats administered the drug are decreased in the presence of VP antibodies. Finally, we investigated the role played by NO. Blocking the activity of the enzyme responsible for NO formation, NO synthase (NOS) with arginine derivatives, such as L-N nitro-L-arginine-methylester (L-NAME), augments the ACTH response to the iv, but not icv, injection of IL-1/~, and does not significantly alter the influence of EtOH. Interestingly, only the icy administration of IL-1/~, but neither its systemic injection nor exposure to EtOH augments NOS gene expression in the hypothalamus. These results suggest that NO exerts a restraining influence on ACTH released by systemic administration of cytokines, but that its appearance in the hypothalamus is not crucial during stimulation of this brain area by IL-IB.",

However, the acute administration of moderate doses of EtOH does not alter the response of this axis to systemic injection of IL-IB, while significantly decreasing the effect of the icy administration of the protein. As this phenomenon is accompanied by a blunting of hypothalamie c-fos gene expression normally caused by the cytokine, it appears to reflect an inhibitory influence of EtOH on the CNS pathways impinging on the hypothalamus. These data suggest that despite their common reliance on endogenous CRF to release ACTH, in acute experiments, EtOH does not facilitate the stimulation of the HPA axis induced by blood-borne IL-I~; furthermore, the net influence of alcohol becomes inhibitory following central injection of the cytokine. Different results are obtained during long-term exposure to EtOH, a situation under which the drug interferes with the systemic effect of IL-1B on pituitary activity. Hypotheses related to the role of pituitary responsiveness to CRF and VP, and to a possible influence of NO (which is reportedly altered by EtOH), were tested. Feeding rats an alcohol diet for 7-10 days decreases ACTH released by the iv injection of IL-I~ and VP, but not CRF. Blockade of NOS activity significantly reverses the effect of the drug on VP-but not IL-l-induced ACTH secretion. We still do not know whether EtOH differentially alters NO formation in the pituitary (which is the target for blood-borne VP) and the median eminence (which is the primary target for blood-borne IL-I~), or whether other mechanisms are involved.",

During infectious disease, the immunomodulatory nature of stress can be aversive to health. The mammalian response to a stressor is primarily mediated by two neuroendocrine systems: the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis. These neuroendocrine pathways, when activated by exposure to a stressor, release hormones, peptides and neurotransmitters into lymphoid tissues and inflammatory sites. Thus, neuroendocrine factors have the opportunity to interact with specific receptors on antigen-stimulated lymphocytes. Furthermore, neuroendocrine factors can alter the accumulation of mononuclear cells at inflammatory sites by modulating the expression of chemoattractant cytokines and adhesion molecules involved in lymphoid cell trafficking.",

Restraint stress significantly elevated plasma corticosterone (cort) and tissue catecholamine (norepinephrine) responses and suppressed cell-mediated immunity. IL-2 production (a CD4+Thl response) in draining lymph nodes and spleen was suppressed in restrained animals, while anti-viral antibody responses (which require CD4+Th2 cytokines) were essentially intact. Elevated levels of plasma cort correlated with reduced lymphocyte trafficking to the lungs and draining lymph nodes of virus-infected mice. Lymphadenopathy and cell accumulation at the inflammatory site were restored by treating restrained animals with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (RU486). However, T cell activation in the draining lymph nodes remained suppressed, unless a/~-adrenergic receptor antagonist (nadolol) was given. Antagonism of the/~-adrenergic receptor suggested a role for catecholamine in the regulation of T cell activation. We hypothesize that stress acts as a co-factor in the progression of infection by enhancing Th2 while diminishing Thl responses to viral antigen. We and others have shown ACTH and MSH to inhibit several immune functions. To further assess the potential of POMC peptides, as autocrine/paracrine cytokines in the immune system, we examined the effects of ACTH and MSH on intracellular transcription factor activity. Human promonocytic U937 and monocytic THP-1 cell lines were treated with MSH or ACTH and assayed for transcription factor binding activity in their nuclear extracts. The human H9 T-cell line was also assayed for changes in transcription factors under similar conditions. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), nuclear extracts from THP-1 or U937 cells demonstrated a transient increase in the CREB transcription factor binding activity which peaked at 15 minutes followed by a reduction over the following two hours. Under similar conditions NF-kB binding activity was reduced at 30 and 60 minutes post-stimulation with ACTH in H9 cells and MSH in U937 cells, following which binding activity returned to pre-stimulation baseline levels. The U937 cells constitutively produce ACTH. Therefore antiserum to ACTH was added to U937 cell cultures and the nuclear extract analysed by EMSA. NF-kB-like binding was increased, which suggests that endogenous ACTH was inhibiting NF-kB activity.",

These actions are consistent with these peptides as members of the growing family of anti-inflammatory cytoldnes and may represent an endogenous mechanism to limit immune system activation. The inhibitory activity of these peptides and their increased production during stress are consistent with stress-induced immunosuppression and as an important neuro-immune link. Tobacco smoke and alcohol are the two most abused drugs in the world and, in the USA alone, the combined death toll resulting from their abuse exceeds 500,000. Both drugs are known to predispose individuals to many diseases, and this susceptibility has been postulated to result from the negative effects of these drugs on the immune system. However, the mechanism through which these drugs affect the immune system is not clearly understood. We have demonstrated that chronic exposure of rats to cigarette smoke inhibits the antibody plaque-forming cell (PFC) response. The immunosuppressive effects of cigarette smoke are associated with the nicotinecontaining particulate phase of cigarette smoke, and chronic exposure to nicotine also results in inhibition of the PFC response. Nicotine appears to affect the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway in both B and T lymphocytes. These effects of nicotine may be related to the presence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) on the lymphocyte cell surface. In fact, nicotine, both in-vivo and in-vitro, activates lymphocytes leading to enhanced tyrosine kinase and phospholipase C activities. Preactivation of lymphocytes with nicotine makes these cells refractory to the normal antigen-mediated activation signaling. This is the first study to indicate that nAchRs in lymphocytes may be linked to a second messenger system and explain the presence of cholinergic inervations in lymphoid tissues.",

Thus, immunological susceptibility to chronic ethanol intake is a dominant genetic trait, and may be an important component contributing to the variability in published results on the immunological consequences of chronic ethanol consumption Anterior pituitary (AP) hormone secretion is subject to multiple levels of regulation. The medial basal hypothalamus secretes releasing hormones (e.g. peptides, biogenic amines) that either inhibit or stimulate AP hormone release. In addition, target tissues elaborate hormones that feedback upon neuroendocrine structures to affect hypothalamic or AP hormone secretion.

We further hypothesized the production of IL-6 within certain subpopulations of AP cells, since circulating levels of this cytokine are not normally significant. Cultured AP cells released IL-6 in response to endotoxin, interleukin-lB (IL-1/~) and increased intracellular concentrations of cAMP. These data indicated a possible paracrine role for IL-6 in the facilitation of AP hormone release. Indeed, an anti-rat IL-6 antibody inhibited prolactin release in a time-dependent manner by 30%.

This monokine enhanced phospholipase A2 activity, generating arachidonic acid (AA) and glycerophosphorylcholine (GroPCho). AA stimulated IL-6 in a 5-1ipoxygenase-dependent manner. The hypothetical PLA2 intermediate, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), also stimulated 1L-6 in a concentration-responsive manner. The effect was dependent on the 1-acyl chain length, the presence of the phosphocholine headgroup, and could be blocked by protein kinase C inhibitors (e.g. H7, chelerythrine). Thus, these data indicate that IL-I~ induces AP IL-6 release via a novel mechanism involving LysoPC activation of PKC in the absence of increased diacylglycerol or calcium. The resulting increased eytokinergic tone within the AP may result in the facilitation of the secretion of several AP hormones. Appropriate stimulating conditions, such as endotoxin, have been found to induce IL-1 throughout much of the brain, resulting in widespread presence of IL-1 in extracellular fluid of the brain. This IL-1 can have a variety of effects. When infused into rat brain, very low doses of recombinant human interleukin-l~e (IL-1B; as low as 3.1 fmol) has been found to suppress a variety of peripheral cellular immune responses measured in blood and splenic lymphocytes, including natural killer cell (NK) activity, response of lymphocytes to mitogen, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. This suppression occurred very rapidly (within 15 rain) and lasted for several hours; rebound enhancement of immune responses was not seen. Infusion of endotoxin (LPS, 10 ng) into the brain to stimulate release of endogenous IL-1 produced similar suppression of these immune responses, and this effect could be blocked by infusion in brain of low doses (e.g. 10 ng) of a-MSH, a known blocker of cytokine action. Thus, exogenous IL-1 or endogenously released IL-1 acting in brain suppresses cellular immune responses. Further studies showed that this suppression of cellular immune responses by IL-1 occurs via activation of both the pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, and requires corticotrophin relcasing factor (CRF) as an intermediary. Finally, recent studies have shown that infusion of the HIV envelope protein gpl20 into the rat brain also stimulates release of IL-1 in brain and thereby suppresses pcripheral cellular immune responscs. Thus gpl20-induced release of IL-I in brain may bc responsible for some characteristics seen in HIV-infected individuals (e.g. elevated circulating cortisol), and may also play a role in the disruption of immune rcsponses secn in HIV-infected individuals.",
