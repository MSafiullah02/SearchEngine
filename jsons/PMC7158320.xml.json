Textbooks, reviews, and conferences focusing on the airway frequently ignore this facet of management despite the observation that airway complications are significantly more likely to be associated with extubation than intubation.14 Many of these \u201ccomplications\u201d are relatively minor, such as coughing and transient breath-holding, and have little or no impact upon outcome. Some, however, are life threatening. Moreover, some can be predicted and, with proper preparation, morbidity and mortality can be reduced.",

This chapter classifies the complications associated with tracheal extubation (and the exchange of endotracheal tubes), attempts to stratify the risk of extubation (and tube exchange) in various clinical settings, and proposes strategies that may prove helpful in reducing serious complications or death. Low-risk or routine extubation has been reviewed elsewhere124, 192 and is discussed in less detail. It is important to point out that neither the proposed stratification nor the strategies recommended in dealing with intermediate- and high-risk extubations have been validated by controlled, prospective trials. Such trials would be helpful, but it may not be prudent to await their conclusion.",

Fastidious attention to securing the tube, providing support for the circuit, and, when necessary, moving the patient and the tube as an integral unit should help to reduce the frequency of this complication. Self-extubations may occur during emergence from anesthesia when the patient is confused, agitated, or distressed, prompting premature extubation. In the ICU, it may not be possible to know whether a self-extubation is accidental or deliberate, but many of these patients require reintubation33 and are more likely to exhibit postextubation stridor,193 and the situation may involve multiple intubation attempts, esophageal intubation, and death.194, 255\n",

Fixation of the ET by Kirschner wires,169 screws,165 or ligatures3 and entanglement with other devices99, 132 have been described. Entrapment can also occur during the performance of a percutaneous tracheostomy.56 Mechanical obstruction of an entrapped tube is a life-threatening complication. As well, partial transection of the ET by an osteotome during a maxillary osteotomy has resulted in the partially cut tube forming a \u201cbarb\u201d that caught on the posterior aspect of the hard palate.229 One report of entrapment had fatal consequences. This involved a Carlens tube that was inadvertently sutured to the pulmonary artery.83 Lang and coauthors165 have recommended routine intraoperative testing for ET movement when fixation devices are used in proximity to the airway. Uncertainty about tube movement should prompt fiberoptic examination prior to emergence from general anesthesia.165\n",

This has resulted in a reevaluation of the risks of coughing, at least in a subset of patients. It is premature to speculate upon the long-term and geographic implications of this illness; however, from the perspective of an anesthesiologist in the North American epicenter for SARS, Toronto, Canada,38, 215 coughing upon emergence potentially disperses infected respiratory droplets on those in the patient's vicinity.

Retroarytenoidal edema restricts movement of the arytenoid cartilages, limiting vocal cord abduction during inspiration. Subglottic edema, a particular problem in neonates and infants, results in swelling of the loose submucosal connective tissue, confined by the nonexpandable cricoid cartilage. In neonates and small children, this is the narrowest part of the upper airway and small reductions in diameter result in a significant increase in airway resistance. In children, laryngeal edema is promoted by a tight-fitting ET, traumatic intubation, duration of intubation greater than 1 hour, coughing on the ET, and intraoperative alterations of head position.156 These investigators found an incidence of 1% in children younger than 17 years. Laryngeal edema should be suspected when inspiratory stridor develops within 6 hours of extubation. Management of laryngeal edema depends upon its severity. Treatment options include head-up positioning, supplemental humidified oxygen, racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen administration, reintubation, and tracheostomy.",

This is protective to the extent that it prevents aspiration of solids and liquids. It becomes maladaptive when it restricts ventilation and oxygenation. The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are the main mediators of laryngospasm. These include the cricothyroids, lateral cricoarytenoids, and the thyroarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscles are the vocal cord tensors, an action mediated by the superior laryngeal nerve. Management of laryngospasm consists of prevention by either extubating at a sufficiently deep plane of anesthesia147 or awaiting recovery of consciousness. Potential airway irritants should be removed and painful stimulation should be discontinued. If laryngospasm occurs, oxygen by sustained positive pressure may be helpful, although this may push the aryepiglottic folds more tightly together.228 Very small doses of a short-acting neuromuscular blocker55, 164 with or without reintubation may be necessary.",

At 6 years of age, he came to medical attention for investigation of a weak voice. A unilateral prolapsed arytenoid was noted and was managed with speech therapy. The adults had had difficult and unsuccessful intubations, whereas the child had not. Removal of the ET in one case and the tracheostomy tube in the other case was followed by stridor requiring immediate reintubation or recannulation. Laryngoscopy revealed a unilateral dislocated arytenoid in one case and contralateral vocal cord palsy in the other case. In both cases, an arytenoidectomy was performed. The authors suggested that this complication could be more common than the literature would have us believe. Persistent postextubation hoarseness, a breathy voice, and an ineffective cough should prompt an assessment by an otolaryngologist. The diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic visualization of an immobile vocal cord associated with a rotated arytenoid cartilage.177 If the diagnosis is made early, before the onset of ankylosis, it may be possible to manipulate the arytenoid back into position.",

If tissue swelling is sufficiently severe, it may result in airway obstruction following extubation. These conditions include generalized edema, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, deep neck infections, pemphigus, and epidermolysis bullosa. The most common situation probably occurs in the ICU after prolonged intubation. Adderley and Mullins described the cuff leak test to evaluate children with croup.1 This was performed by deflating the ET cuff, occluding the tube, and assessing air movement around the tube. Kemper and coworkers concluded that the cuff leak test was the best predictor of successful extubation in a pediatric burn and trauma unit.148 Fisher and Raper found the test to be sensitive but not specific for predicting stridor, necessitating reintubation.103 Others have measured the cuff leak volume as the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes during assist-control ventilation, following cuff deflation.88, 193 Both studies found the cuff leak volume to be predictive of postextubation stridor. Efferen and Elsakr found that 8 of 45 patients exhibited stridor, 4 of whom required reintubation.88 In another study involving 88 adult medical ICU patients (100 intubations), 6 patients exhibited stridor, 3 of whom required reintubation. They observed a significantly lower cuff leak in patients who subsequently developed stridor, concluding that this measurement was the best predictor of the presence or absence of stridor.193\n",

Tracheostomy, on the other hand, may be unnecessary in a significant proportion of patients. Reintubation in the ICU is associated with significant morbidity and mortality,75, 194 particularly if it cannot be achieved easily. The following approach seems reasonable regarding patients in an intensive care setting: if the previous intubation is known to have been easy, no new factors have intervened to complicate laryngoscopy, and experienced personnel are and will remain immediately available, it may be sound to extubate a patient in the absence of a large cuff volume leak.

Venna and Rowbottom256 described 180 patients who had undergone upper cervical spinal surgery, deemed by the surgeon to be at high risk for postoperative swelling. They elected not to extubate patients if they failed (unspecified) extubation criteria, which included demonstration of a cuff leak and the absence of significant upper airway edema on laryngoscopy. This strategy resulted in an average extubation time of 33.5 hours, with 12 patients (6.6%) developing postextubation stridor and breathing problems, 5 of whom required reintubation. Interestingly, the average time from extubation to required reintubation was 14.6 hours and the resultant duration was 6 days. Two deaths occurred as a result of an inability to reintubate. This suggests that such patients warrant careful postoperative monitoring if they fulfill criteria for extubation. Furthermore, reliance on these criteria alone may fail to identify patients who require but cannot be successfully reintubated.",

The incidence of permanent nerve palsies with benign goiters was 0.5 per 100 operations. This was more common in substernal goiters (4%) and thyroid cancer (9%). In the latter group, it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice the nerve to achieve an adequate resection. It remains to be determined whether methods of intraoperative RLN monitoring will reduce this complication.128, 131 Although bilateral RLN palsy is rare, thyroidectomy is the leading cause of this injury. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, supplying the cricothyroid muscle that tenses the vocal folds, is believed to be vulnerable during thyroid dissection; however, the frequency of this injury is unknown.160\n",

In addition, consideration must be paid to the difficulties originally encountered in securing the airway and an evaluation of whether reintubation would be easier or more difficult as a consequence of surgery and resuscitation. The lack of guidance from the literature makes communication between anesthesiologist, surgeon, and intensivist essential. Intermaxillary fixation requires that wire cutters be immediately available and that personnel know which wires to cut, should this prove necessary. A fiberoptic bronchoscope, provisions for an emergency surgical airway, and the required expertise should be immediately available at the time of extubation. Many would advocate that fiberoptic airway evaluation be performed prior to extubation, although assessment may be limited to supraglottic structures and exclusion of tube entrapment.

The literature is unclear about the indications for preoperative or postdrainage tracheostomy, although clearly a surgical airway is required if efforts to intubate are unsuccessful or constitute a serious risk of rupturing the abscess. Potter and colleagues retrospectively compared the outcomes of 34 patients in whom a tracheostomy was performed and 51 patients who remained intubated following surgical drainage.214 All patients had undergone surgical drainage for impending airway compromise and required airway support postoperatively. It was not always evident to the investigators why a particular strategy was chosen. Airway loss occurred more commonly in the intubated patients, but this was not statistically significant. Two deaths occurred, one resulting from an unplanned extubation and the other from postextubation laryngeal edema and inability to reestablish the airway. Interestingly, the latter patient was noted to have a cuff leak prior to extubation and developed signs of obstruction 30 minutes after the ET was removed. If a decision is made to manage the patient without a tracheostomy, great care must be taken to ensure proper timing of extubation and the immediate provision of equipment and expertise to attend to potential complications. It is improbable that drainage will result in immediate airway improvement, and reintubation or an emergent surgical airway, if required, may be complicated by edema, tissue distortion, and urgency.",

The risk factors identified by Emery and colleagues included a smoking history, moderate or severe preoperative myelopathy, extensive multilevel decompression with prolonged surgery, and tissue retraction.91 The authors recommend 1 to 3 days of elective intubation postoperatively, determination of the presence of a cuff leak, and direct laryngoscopy at extubation.",

Kolman and Morris described a patient who developed severe recurrent airway obstruction following extubation, despite an easy atraumatic intubation performed by direct laryngoscopy.157 At laryngoscopy, the vocal folds appeared white, thickened, and poorly mobile despite complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade. An urgent ENT consultation confirmed the diagnosis of paramedian vocal cord fixation secondary to cricoarytenoid arthritis. The glottic inlet was severely narrowed, necessitating a tracheostomy under local anesthesia. Decannulation was achieved after 1 month. Complete airway obstruction is a well-described but fortunately an infrequent complication, despite involvement of the cricoarytenoids in 26% to 86% of patients with RA.155, 157 This disarticular joint can be affected like any other joint with inflammation, pannus formation, cartilaginous or ligamentous erosion, joint space obliteration, ankylosis, and fibrosis. Chronic cricoarytenoid arthritis may be mistaken for asthma or chronic bronchitis, with symptoms of dyspnea, hoarseness, or stridor. At laryngoscopy, the mucosa may be rough and thick and the vocal chink is narrowed. Although airway obstruction occurs most commonly in patients with long-standing RA having polyarticular and systemic involvement, laryngeal stridor has been described as the sole manifestation of this disease.118\n",

Several authors have recommended postponing extubation until the patient is wide awake. Unfortunately, this provides increased protection against nothing other than laryngospasm and aspiration. In addition, the prevailing wisdom is that patients with limited mouth opening and a potentially unstable cervical spine should be intubated with a flexible fiberscope.262 This method involves the blind passage of the ET through the cords, which may be traumatic,60, 182 particularly in the presence of preexisting cricoarytenoid arthritis. Regional anesthesia should be considered as an alternative to general anesthesia when appropriate. When intubation cannot be avoided, proposed extubation strategies include a preemptive tracheostomy or a method that increases the \u201creversibility\u201d of extubation. Neither strategy has been prospectively evaluated in this population. These are discussed in detail under \u201cExtubation Strategies.\u201d",

The severity of the dynamic obstruction is proportional to the inspiratory force. Thus, a distressed patient is more likely to exhibit severe symptoms. Positive pressure or bypassing the lesion with an ET provides relief while further management options are considered.

This usually occurs early in the course of the disease and may be manifested by complaints of hoarseness, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and stridor. Upper airway obstruction is usually diffuse and may progress to involvement of the glottis, subglottic area, trachea, and bronchial cartilages. Histologically, there is evidence of perichondral inflammation and replacement of cartilage by fibrous tissue, manifesting in inflammatory swelling and progressive destruction of cartilage. The clinical manifestations range from bronchorrhea and recurrent pneumonia to airway collapse. Medical management consists of steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressants, but these are of variable benefit. Surgical management consists of external airway splinting or self-expanding metallic stents. These patients may present for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, tracheal or nasal reconstruction, aortic valve replacement, or stent placement.35, 44, 104, 127, 252 Airway collapse following extubation should be anticipated and may be effectively dealt with by CPAP.2, 253\n",

Tongue suspension is one of several approaches introduced to manage the latter group of patients.57 This involves the placement of an anchoring screw in the geniotubercle and the attachment of a suture through the base of the tongue. Szokol and associates described a morbidly obese patient with OSA in whom such a procedure was performed.244 Both laryngoscopy and bag-mask ventilation had been difficult. At the conclusion of the procedure, the patient was fully awake, able to sustain a head lift for 5 seconds, demonstrated a negative inspiratory pressure of 40 cm H2O, and was extubated. Stridor was noted immediately, and bag-mask and LMA ventilation was ineffective. Attempts to reintubate the patient were unsuccessful, necessitating a cricothyrotomy. Subsequent direct laryngoscopy showed a markedly swollen epiglottis and grossly edematous laryngeal and hypopharyngeal tissue. The patient developed negative-pressure pulmonary edema and a tracheostomy was performed 2 days later because of persistent swelling. Tracheal decannulation occurred uneventfully 2 weeks later. The authors speculated that airway manipulation during the surgery was the cause of this patient's swelling. They did not consider that the swelling may have resulted from or at least been worsened by repeated attempts at laryngoscopy.",

Prior to intubation, difficult bag-mask ventilation may result in gastric distention. This may be further complicated if laryngoscopy proves difficult because this may delay securing the airway and repeated laryngoscopic attempts may cause edema, thereby decreasing the glottic opening. Clearly, aspiration can cause serious morbidity and death.200, 206, 260 In a multicenter, prospective study looking at major complications associated with anesthesia, aspiration was identified in 27 of 198,103 general anesthetics resulting in 4 deaths and 2 cases of anoxic encephalopathy.248 Aspiration may also result from obtundation or conditions that impair vocal cord apposition (e.g., vocal cord paralysis, residual neuromuscular blockade, and granulomata).",

Postoperative nausea, delayed gastric emptying, residual neuromuscular blockade, relaxation of the esophageal sphincters, decreased level of consciousness, gagging on an ET, and impaired laryngeal competence may all make emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation as problematic as induction. At present, it is not possible to offer evidence-based recommendations on an extubation strategy to reduce aspiration. It would seem logical to minimize the preceding contributing factors\u2014postoperative nausea and vomiting, residual neuromuscular blockade, decreased level of consciousness and associated diminished protective airway reflexes, and perhaps gastric evacuation. We do not know whether gastric decompression reduces aspiration, although a well-seated ProSeal LMA (PLMA) may61, 184 or may not63 offer some protection from aspiration. Nonetheless, with the present body of information, it is not appropriate to recommend specifically the use of this device in a patient recognized to be at increased risk for aspiration.",

Thus, knowledge of prior difficulties may result in intubation conditions that are less favorable to success.

Deep extubation ordinarily would involve the prior reversal of neuromuscular blockade and resumption of spontaneous ventilation. Its purported advantage is the avoidance of the adverse reflexes associated with extubation, such as hypertension, dysrhythmias, coughing, laryngospasm, and increased IOP or ICP. The fundamental disadvantage of deep extubation is the patient's inability to protect the airway against obstruction and aspiration. If it is improperly executed, laryngospasm and its attendant complications are more likely to occur. Although not having to await the recovery of consciousness may accelerate OR turnover, the exhalation of unscavenged volatile anesthetic agents may result in occupational health and safety issues. A significant proportion of American anesthesiologists practice the technique, at least some of the time, yet there are very few data in adults comparing the safety of deep versus awake extubation.68 Koga and colleagues compared three small groups of adult patients, extubated deep, awake, or extubated deep following the insertion of an LMA.154 Straining occurred in a high (but comparable) proportion of patients whether the ET was removed prior or subsequent to recovery of consciousness. Deep extubation followed by LMA insertion (isoflurane 2% to 3%) is discussed subsequently. Deep extubation is contraindicated when mask ventilation was found or is likely to have become difficult, the risk of aspiration is increased, endotracheal intubation had been difficult, or airway edema is likely.",

The LMAs were removed when the patients resumed spontaneous ventilation and obeyed commands. None of the 10 patients coughed, and changes in the rate-pressure product were minimal. The authors concluded that the technique might prove useful in patients undergoing other types of surgical procedures. They stressed that this substitution should be performed only by those skilled in LMA insertion. Patients must be at a sufficient depth of anesthesia or coughing, breath holding, laryngospasm, and the very pressor responses this substitution is intended to avoid may occur. Bailey and others recommended that the LMA be inserted prior to removal of the ET, with the purported advantage of not risking loss of the airway following tracheal extubation.77, 154 Compared with deep tracheal extubation followed by Guedel airway insertion, there was a lower incidence of coughing and requirement for airway manipulation.77 Koga and coworkers compared this technique with deep and awake tracheal extubation. As previously mentioned, they observed no difference in recovery conditions between patients in whom the ET was removed either deep or awake; however, they noted a significant improvement in recovery conditions when the LMA substitution was performed. This technique might be useful in patients undergoing procedures in which coughing, straining, and intraocular, intracranial, and BP changes could be particularly detrimental. Patients at risk for aspiration are not protected. Furthermore, patients difficult to intubate by laryngoscopy are probably poor candidates for this technique because airway patency cannot be guaranteed after the LMA substitution.",

This can be very helpful in the patient suspected of having tracheomalacia, vocal cord paresis, or PVCM. It also permits the assessment of supraglottic structures.74 In this author's experience, such opportunities are maximized by reassuring the patient, judicious sedation, an antisialagogue, and the use of an auxiliary Yankauer sucker for oral secretions. The FOB is placed above the carina and the cuff is slowly deflated to minimize coughing. The ET is slowly withdrawn into the oropharynx with subsequent, very gradual withdrawal of the FOB to the supraglottic region. Once the patient is comfortable, the FOB is further withdrawn to a position just above the vocal cords. Even with such a deliberate technique, the exercise is frequently frustrated by excessive secretions, coughing, swallowing, or poor tolerance with insufficient opportunity to visualize the structures of interest.",

He was also suffering from severe ARDS. A WuScope allowed successful glottic visualization, permitting the insertion of a suction catheter anterior to the existing nasotracheal tube. The latter was withdrawn and the replacement oral ET was easily advanced over the suction catheter with minimal interruption of mechanical ventilation. In this author's opinion, the visual control possible with a WuScope (or presumably a Bullard Scope [Circon, Santa Barbara, CA], Upsher UltraScope [Mercury Medical, Clearwater, FL], or videolaryngoscope) is preferable to the blind passage of an ET over an FOB or tube exchanger. A hollow tube exchanger, however, would have permitted jet ventilation if desaturation or difficulties with tube advancement had occurred. The author has had personal experience performing tube exchanges under direct vision using the Bullard laryngoscope and the GlideScope (Saturn Biomedical, Burnaby, BC).",

After the substitution is performed and with the patient under anesthesia or a suitable degree of sedation, muscle relaxation can be reversed and spontaneous ventilation be allowed to resume. An FOB is then be passed through an LMA, and dynamic vocal fold movement and appearance can be assessed while concentrations of oxygen and volatile agents (if necessary) can be controlled.

The smallest can be used with a 3 mm ID ET. These devices are radiopaque and have distance markings between 15 and 30 cm from the distal end. There are two distal side holes and an end hole. Proximally, there are two types of connectors, secured and released by a patented Rapi-Fit adapter. These were designed for easy adapter removal as the ET is being off-loaded and subsequent reattachment for ventilation while the new tube is being introduced. A secure Luer-Lok fitting is available for jet ventilation and a 15-mm connector for manual ventilation. The length and inner diameters (1.6 to 3.4 mm) make manual ventilation with a resuscitation bag possible but impractical because resistance is so high. The 15-mm Rapi-Fit connector serves primarily as a means of connecting the exchange catheter to an oxygen source. During jet ventilation, the paucity of distal side holes potentially increases catheter whip and the risk of barotrauma.89 Loudermilk and others used the 11 Fr, 83 cm CAEC in 40 high-risk adult extubations, 3 of which required reintubation. This was easily performed with each attempt. The exchange catheters were also used for oxygen insufflation. All but one patient tolerated the device, and dislodgement occurred in one patient.178\n",

Phonation and discomfort were similar in both groups with only 3 of 101 patients experiencing significant discomfort. Cough effort tended to be reduced in the larger sized CAEC, but this did not achieve significance. Atlas also looked at a larger tube exchanger (JEM 400 ET Changer, Instrumentation Industries, Bethel Park, PA), which it was reasoned would have a higher degree of success as a tube exchanger. This device has an OD of 6.35 mm and is said to be stiffer. Atlas adapted the JEM 400 using the Rapi-Fit connector from the CAEC 19-83 to enable jet ventilation.16 This device, however, has only a single end hole and is not recommended for jet ventilation (see later).",

Using an in vitro model, with three sizes of Sheridan TTX catheters, Dworkin and colleagues measured the inspiratory and expiratory flows resulting from 50 psi injection as the simulated upper airway resistance, lung compliance, gas flow rate, and injection times were varied.85 The upper airway resistance was determined by the effective tracheal diameter, which they defined as a computed difference between the OD of the TTX and tracheal diameter. They simulated upper airway obstruction by using various sizes of ET adapters, ranging from 11 to 3.5 mm ID, in the proximal airway. The gas flows through the large, medium, and small tube exchangers, when connected to a pressure source of 50 psi, were 63, 33, and 12 L/min, respectively. In their model, if the difference between the tracheal and TTX diameters resulted in an effective tracheal diameter that was greater than 4 to 4.5 mm, air trapping did not occur. Because increased upper airway resistance and reduced effective tracheal diameter resulted in larger tidal volumes, they concluded that jet ventilation through a long catheter, positioned close to the carina, caused little Venturi effect. Such ventilation was not greatly dependent upon air entrainment. Placement of the catheter close to the carina may ensure a higher oxygen concentration (by reducing room air entrainment), but it also increases the risk of distal catheter migration and barotrauma.",

An alternative approach would be to reduce the driving pressure. Gaughan and others assessed the tidal volumes and air entrainment in a model lung with a range of compliance sets, ventilated by high and low flow regulators through 14 and 16 g intravenous catheters.113 Their high-flow regulator, at steady state, produced flow rates of 320 L/min at 100 psi, whereas the low-flow regulator produced flows up to 15 L/min at 9 to 5 psi. Intravenous catheters, because of their short length, offer considerably less resistance to flow. Their proximity to the upper airway also results in greater air entrainment (15% to 74%). Both high- and low-flow regulators allowed adequate minute ventilation in the setting of normal tracheal and bronchial diameters and normal compliance. The authors recommended that during transtracheal jet ventilation, when low-flow regulators were used, an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:1 should be used because it yields the greatest minute ventilation. Although this observation is undoubtedly true, it remains to be determined whether such minute volumes are either clinically necessary or safe.30, 64\n",

The more side holes at a given driving pressure, the lower the pressure at the catheter tip. They recommended vigilance regarding the location of the catheter tip (avoidance of direct mucosal contact, insertion into orifices where exhalation may be restricted, and securing the catheter to minimize migration); advocated for catheters with multiple side holes, the use of small-diameter jet catheters to minimize the resistance to exhalation, and the use of the minimal effective driving pressure; and encouraged the development and use of an effective pressure sensor and pressure cutoff device.",

In a subsequent report, a patient ventilated for 90 minutes at only 20 psi developed a pneumothorax.64 Chan and Manninen also described the use of the ETVC to provide jet ventilation.49 After performing a fiberoptic intubation in a patient with an unstable cervical spine, they discovered that the cuff of the ET had been damaged. They inserted an FOB through the other nostril and advanced this through the cords, anterior to the original ET. They then passed an ETVC through the original ET and provided three breaths of jet ventilation at 50 psi. The patient developed a pneumothorax. Unfortunately, they used a high driving pressure through an exchange catheter that may have been too deeply inserted in the setting of a significantly reduced effective tracheal diameter (partial cuff deflation, 6-mm ET, and FOB passing through the vocal cords).",

The duration of inspiration should be minimized while the duration of exhalation is determined by observing the return of the thoracic diameter to its preinspiratory position. The depth of catheter insertion should be far enough from the carina that distal migration does not occur but not so proximal that jet ventilation results in the catheter's ejection from the glottis.

Accordingly, the ASA Task Force and the Canadian Airway Focus Group have recommended that each anesthesiologist have a preformulated strategy for extubation of the DA. This chapter proposes a risk stratification scheme in an effort to identify patients in whom special extubation precautions might be of benefit. A variety of strategies are presented, although generally the benefits of these have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation. The concept of a reversible extubation using a tube exchanger has been presented. When such a device is used as a stylet, it does not provide a guarantee that reintubation will succeed.
