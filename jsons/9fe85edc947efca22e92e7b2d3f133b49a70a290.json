This creates a serious ethical dilemma to balance between the risk from untreated depression vs. the risk from COVID-19. To balance between the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice is a significant challenge in this context 9 . Our approach at the at the Parkwood Institute-Mental Health Care Building, an academic site of Western University in London Ontario Canada, is to go through a rigorous patient prioritization process (see Figure 1 ), which is largely modelled after the recently published International Society for ECT and Neurostimulation recommendations. 10 We colour-code cases to red (emergent), orange (highly urgent), yellow (urgent but can wait for up to 4 weeks), green (can be clinically monitored without treatment but provide quick access if the acuity changes) and gray (stable long term, can be re-referred for new episode of illness). For those that we select for treatment, we go through a revision of the informed consent procedure to reflect the added risk of infection. We then conduct the ECT procedure in an ECT room that is modified to provide negative pressure and allow optimum air circulation between patients. All staff providing ECT are geared in full personal protective equipment, which is changed between patients while the room is being ventilated and sterilized. Prior to ECT, patients are screened clinically for COVID-19 status, and if screened positive, we would test for the virus using PCR 4 . COVID-19 + status will require added pre-cautions in consultation with the infection disease pandemic management team in the hospital. Out of the list of 44 patients, we triaged 2 to red zone, 6 to orange zone, 3 to yellow zone, 17 to green and 17 to gray zone. We were able to start or re-start ECT to all of those in the red and orange zone within a week of initiating this process.",
