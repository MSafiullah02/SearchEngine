pharyngoconjunctival fever is well established. However, the relationships, if any, of HAdV persistence and reactivation in the development of the chronic adenotonsillar disease is not fully understood. The present paper reports a 3-year cross-sectional hospital-based study aimed at detecting and quantifying HAdV DNA and mRNA of the HAdV hexon gene in adenoid and palatine tonsil tissues and nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) from patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent adenotonsillitis. HAdV C, B, and E were detectable in nearly 50% of the patients, with no association with the severity of airway obstruction, nor with the presence of recurrent tonsillitis, sleep apnea or otitis media with effusion (OME). Despite the higher rates of respiratory viral coinfections in patients with HAdV, the presence of other viruses, including DNA and RNA viruses, had no association with HAdV replication or shedding in secretions. Higher HAdV loads in adenoids showed a significant positive correlation with the presence of sleep apnea and the absence of OME. Although this study indicates that a significant proportion (~85%) of individuals with chronic adenotonsillar diseases have persistent nonproductive HAdV infection, including those by HAdV C, B, and E, epithelial and subepithelial cells in tonsils seem to be critical for HAdV C production and shedding in NPS in some patients, since viral antigen was detected in these regions by immunohistochemistry in four patients, all of which were also positive for HAdV mRNA detection.

Currently, seven HAdV species (A-G) have been identified and are classified in the genus Mastadenovirus of the family Adenoviridae. 4 HAdV can infect a large variety of cell types and tissues in humans, leading to a broad array of diseases, including acute respiratory infections (ARI), 5 febrile exudative tonsillitis, 6 acute conjunctivitis, 7 cystitis, gastroenteritis, 4 and rare cases of encephalitis, 8 myocarditis, 9 and hepatitis. 10 Although HAdV infections are generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, acute HAdV diseases have a significant impact on children (especially under 4 years of age), elderly, immunosuppressed individuals, and military recruits. 4 While HAdV can replicate in several cells types in vitro and is associated with productive infections in different tissues in humans, several HAdV species present varied tissue specificities. For instance, HAdV C (serotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6) are commonly associated with acute tonsillitis and respiratory diseases, whereas HAdV-F (serotypes 40 and 41) and HAdV D (serotypes 8, 19 , and 37) are typically associated with gastrointestinal infections and a relatively severe and highly contagious form of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, respectively. 1 Following the HAdV replication cycle, the viral genome can persist in the nucleus. 11, 12 Such a fact is best exemplified by the persistence of HAdV C after primary infections of the respiratory tract, with intermittent viral excretion in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) and feces. [13] [14] [15] Numerous studies have shown that lymphocytes of tonsils and adenoids are essential sites of HAdV persistence, namely of the species C. 16 Indeed, seminal studies indicated the ability of HAdV to persist in tonsils and adenoids, since it was possible to recover HAdV from these tissues weeks to months after the establishment of explant cultures. 2, 17 More recent studies using tissue cell separation and sorting have revealed that HAdV DNA is present in T lymphocytes of tonsils and adenoids. 18 In addition, several established human lymphocyte cell lines, including a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a bone marrow transplant recipient with adenovirus pneumonia, may sustain prolonged and noncytopathic adenovirus infection. 19, 20 Although substantial knowledge has been obtained regarding mechanisms associated with viral persistence in human cell lines in vitro, 21 Quantification of the HadV genome and the detection of mRNA of the HAdV hexon gene was performed in human adenoids and tonsils, NPS, and peripheral blood (PB) from patients with tonsillar hypertrophy and were compared to those obtained in samples from control patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 112, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 390, "end": 391, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 545, "end": 546, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 578, "end": 579, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 602, "end": 603, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 631, "end": 632, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 665, "end": 666, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 680, "end": 685, "text": "9 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 697, "end": 699, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 939, "end": 940, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1290, "text": "40 and 41)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1315, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1318, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1487, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1574, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1577, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1774, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1779, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1784, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1922, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2133, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2136, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2281, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2521, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2522, "end": 2524, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2661, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The present study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee (#10466/2008).
