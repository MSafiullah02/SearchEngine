Motivated by an activatorinhibitor approach that is believed to dominate the initiation of side-branching, I show that the mechanism stems from the nonlinear (subcritical) Turing bifurcation to periodic and spatially localized solutions that are essential for excitation at the differentiation-front propagation. The results demonstrate a distinct robust mechanism of side-branching through numerical analysis of model equations that have been employed to study branching in the lungs.",

While the mechanism of side-branching remain obscured due to multiscale processes that range from molecular to tissue levels [15] , recent experimental studies indicate that biochemical signaling at the mesoscale is the dominant feature in the initiation of branches [3, 9, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , i.e., roughly speaking the interactions between proteins, ligands and receptors, e.g., similar signaling paths (albeit with distinct subsets) were drawn for ingrowths of the lung, salivary gland and kidney [11] . Specifically, this work was motivated by suppression of side-branches in the lungs upon addition of matrix GLA protein (MGP), which is the inhibitor of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activator [3], as shown in the reused Fig. 1 .",

The results demonstrate a distinct robust mechanism of side-branching through numerical analysis of model equations that have been employed to study branching in the lungs.",

While the mechanism of side-branching remain obscured due to multiscale processes that range from molecular to tissue levels [15] , recent experimental studies indicate that biochemical signaling at the mesoscale is the dominant feature in the initiation of branches [3, 9, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , i.e., roughly speaking the interactions between proteins, ligands and receptors, e.g., similar signaling paths (albeit with distinct subsets) were drawn for ingrowths of the lung, salivary gland and kidney [11] . Specifically, this work was motivated by suppression of side-branches in the lungs upon addition of matrix GLA protein (MGP), which is the inhibitor of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activator [3] , as shown in the reused Fig. 1 .",

Due to the relatively cumbersome form of the model equations, the study mostly involves bifurcation analysis via the numerical path continuation method in one- space dimensions (1D) and validations by direct numerical simulations (DNS) in 1D and 2D. In the end, I discuss possible implications that could shed new light on other biochemical feedbacks, where side-branching is needed (e.g., mammalian organs and plant roots) or inhibit them when it is known to be notorious (e.g., metastasis). pulmonary vascular and lung development [3] \u2202A \u2202t",

Previous studies of Eqs. 1 have explored numerically the phenomenology of branching in 2D and 3D [28, 31, 32] and in some cases linear analysis was also incorporated to gain insights [29, 30] . The most prominent feature of these works is propagation of new branches which are characterized by a peak shape activator concentration at the front of the differentiated marker. The spatially localized concentrations have been identified as propagating peaks. However, it should be emphasized that unlike typical propagating solitary waves (e.g., excitable pulses) that biasymptote in space to the same rest state, localized solutions of (1) are in fact fronts with an overshot structure, bearing a similarity to actin polymerization that manifests the dynamics of circular dorsal ruffles [35] . Next, I show that in addition to these fronts (with an overshoot form), these are the 1D coexisting stationary periodic and localized solutions on top of the uniform activator that trigger the 2D sidebranching.",

For the high value of \u03c1 H there are a few nucleations of peaks that appear without a specific length scale, after a relatively long period of time, as shown in Fig. 2(a) . At the nucleation, the peak amplitudes are the largest and then they saturate through the side-branch propagation, e.g., times t = 1440 and t = 1460. As \u03c1 H is decreased, the nucleation starts at a much earlier time (t = 230) and the forming peaks become separated in specific spatial scale along the circumference, see t = 250 in Fig 2(b) . After the initial nucleation no additional nucleations occur and the sidebranches form a \"corona-type\" shape during their propagation, see t = 1000. The former case implies, in general, absence of side-branching the latter case supports side-branching, consistently with [3] (although here no fluctuations in c 0 where used). Thus, to reveal the origin behind this nucleation mechanism and relating it to side branching, a nonlinear analysis is performed in what follows.",

The periodic solutions, L T , bifurcate subcritically, that is, towards the stable direction of the uniform state (see Fig. 3(b) ), and as expected, are at first unstable (marked by the dark dashed line). Typically, periodic solutions of Turing type are accompanied by spatially localized solutions (homoclinic connections in space) that organize in a \"snakes and ladders\" structure [38] . By performing continuation on large domains, L h L T , I indeed find localized solutions (light line) but these are only single-peak states and do not form a typical homoclinic snaking structure but rather organize in a single branch. Homoclinic snaking phenomena [39] (including AI media [40, 41] ) stems from the Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation in space, where the configuration of the spatial eigenvalues corresponds to a double multiplicity at the imaginary axis, cf. [42, 43] . For system (2) , linearization about the stable uniform state, leads to seven eigenvalues (\u03bb) of which four indeed show double multiplicity at the imaginary axis (marked by '\u2022') while the other three are real (marked by '\u00d7' and ' '), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a) . The arrows indicate the direction of the splitting of the imaginary eigenvalues (marked by '\u2022') for \u03c1 H > \u03c1 T H while for \u03c1 H < \u03c1 T H the splitting occurs on the imaginary axis. Note that two out of the three real eigenvalues (marked by '\u00d7') are symmetric whereas the third eigenvalue (marked by ' ') breaks the spatial symmetry. Another difference results in extension of the saddle-node (SN) of localized solutions (labeled as L h ) beyond the existence region of periodic Turing states (L T ). The inset in Fig. 3(b) shows that the periodic and the localized solutions have the same form, although L T L h , as demonstrated via the profiles at both SN. I note that in this region there are additional coexisting solutions and additional details but the interest here is solely in the side-branching mechanism so that a more complete analysis will be conducted elsewhere.",

            "text": "The existence of spatially periodic and localized solutions in 1D is related to the nucleation phenomenology in 2D that were demonstrated in Fig. 2 . To show this connection, I first demonstrate how a 1D front propagation looks like, see Fig. 4 . For a high value of \u03c1 H that is outside the coexistence region of localized solutions, DNS show that a single peak forms at early times and then propagation of a front is without an overshoot ( Fig. 4(a) ). For \u03c1 H values that are within the subcritical Turing regime (Fig. 4(b) ), front propagation involves localized oscillations at the front line. These are manifestations of the AI kinetics and can be deduced using the nullclines, i.e., in the (A, Y) plane with invariant manifolds F A = F H = 0. In Fig. 4(c) , I plot two front profiles, one before peak formation (bottom line) and the other through the peak formation (top line) while in the inset plotting the nullclines (solid lines) along with heuristic trajectories (dashed lines) of the spatial solution in the (A, Y) plane. Front propagation increases locally A due to jump in Y, therefore, if \u03c1 H is in the subcritical Turing region, the trajectory goes above the top nullcline (as indicated in the inset by the arrow) along the manifold of the spatially localized solution. Since, the peak height is about A max 0.5 (see inset in Fig. 3(b) ), the trajectory makes a large excursion (the overshoot) before connecting to the trivial state at (A, Y)=(0,0). In the absence of such peaks, the perturbation falls on the left trajectory and connects to the trivial state and thus, has the profile does not show any overshoot. The peak is unstable at the front line and its decay is associated with fast inhibition transport for which the large excursion decreases along the top nullcline (in a reversed direction) to restore a front solution without an overshoot. The latter behavior different from a with two-variable AI system [44] . Note that the first nucleations in 1D occur at about the same time as for the 2D case, about t = 200 (see Fig. 2(b) ). The periodicity of the coexisting 1D solutions is also manifested in the length scale of the peaks at the circumference (see Fig. 2 (b)) while outside the subcritical regime nucleation may still occur but it would be through singular events as in Fig. 2(a) ). Finally, I turn to validation via 2D DNS at the \u03c1 H > \u03c1 T H regime. To generalize the impact of front solutions, I initialize the DNS with a relatively small square seed, as shown in Fig. 5(a) . Specifically, this initial condition has well defined high curvature regions that force the branching initiations. While the existence regions in 2D need not coincide with the 1D [45, 46] , the qualitative behavior still persists. In Figs. 5(b-d), I show that near the Turing onset, the development of sidebranches emerges spontaneously (see (b,c)), where the time to side-branch initiation increases with distance from the Turing's onset. Outside the subcritical Turing regime the side-branches are inhibited, as shown in Fig. 3(d) .",

            "text": "To conclude, using the numerical bifurcation analysis of activator-inhibitor system in 1D, I showed that the nucleation mechanism of side-branches is related to the interplay between a front propagation and a nonlinear (Turing) instability to nonuniform solutions (spatially periodic or localized), where periodic solutions indicate the spatial length scale at which side-branches appear. Outside the coexistence region of nonuniform solutions, where the inhibition (in (1) by cell differentiation) is large enough, side-branching is suppressed. While focusing here on a relatively narrow parameter region, the obtained results reflect on theoretical implications that are known to exist in other parameter choices. For example, the subcritical nature of the Turing instability explains the need for parameter fluctuations that were obtained in previous DNS of (1) [34] , i.e., fluctuations of c 0 lead to large perturbations about the trivial state that in turn produce side branching and form patterns as in Fig. 1(b) [3] . Moreover, the results open intriguing questions about the homoclinic snaking phenomenon, yet, these are beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere.",
