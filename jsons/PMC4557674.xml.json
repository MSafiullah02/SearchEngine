Help can be provided by cytokine production or regulation of co-stimulatory factors, such as CD40/CD40 ligand via antigen-presenting cells.1,2 Nevertheless, the requirement for CD4 T-cell help in primary CD8 T-cell responses is not universal and depends on the in vivo milieu during initial T-cell activation. Primary CD8 T-cell responses against infectious agents are mostly CD4 T-cell independent, whereas responses to non-inflammatory stimulation or non-replicating vaccines are dependent on CD4 T-cell help.3\u20136 Irrespective of the requirement for CD4 T-cell help for primary CD8 T-cell responses, it is accepted that CD4 T-cell help is necessary for the generation of memory CD8 T cells capable of efficient recall responses.5,7,8 CD4 T cells also play a key role in optimal CD8 T-cell expansion in the draining lymph node (LN), subsequent mobilization of activated CD8 T cells into inflamed tissues, as well as their maintenance and survival at effector sites.1,9\u201312",

Infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) produces an acute encephalomyelitis in both C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice, which resolves into a persistent infection associated with chronic demyelination.13 Initial activation of adaptive immunity occurs in the draining cervical LN (CLN).14 Activated CD4 and CD8 T cells subsequently cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and enter the CNS, where they are re-stimulated to secrete interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), express granzyme B, and lyse virus-infected target cells.9,13 CD8 T cells are the major effectors controlling viral load via both IFN-\u03b3 and perforin-mediated mechanisms.15\u201317 Nevertheless, sustained viral RNA indicates persistence at low levels.18 The role of CD4 T cells is complex because they not only promote CD8 T-cell function and survival within the CNS9,10 and directly contribute to viral control, but also enhance pathology.19\u201323",

            "text": "A recent study to assess whether CD4 T cells influence CD8 T cells at the activation or effector stage during JHMV infection revealed that CD4 T cells not only enhance CD8 T-cell expansion in the CLN during priming, but also exert helper function within the CNS by locally promoting CD8 T-cell effector function and survival.9 CD8 T cells were incapable of controlling virus in the CNS without CD4 T cells, even when primed in the presence of CD4 T cells.9 The latter results were obtained in H-2b mice, in which the dominant CD8 T-cell response is directed to an epitope in a hypervariable region of the viral spike (S) protein restricted to H-2Db.24 In the present report, we set out to assess the extent of CD4 T-cell imprinting not only on primary CD8 T-cell responses, but also on memory formation and recall CD8 T-cell responses in the CNS. BALB/c mice were chosen for these studies because they mount a prominent H-2Ld restricted CD8 T-cell response to an epitope in the highly conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is expressed at much higher levels than the S protein,25,26 potentially leading to distinct T-cell activation requirements. An accelerated CD8 T-cell response to the N relative to S epitope is indicated by earlier detection of N-specific relative to S-specific responses in CLN of infected BALB/c14 and C57BL/69 mice, respectively, as well as an early preponderance of N-specific over S-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS of JHMV-infected (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL/6) F1 mice.26 Moreover, adoptive transfers indicate that virus-specific CD8 T cells induced in the context of H-2d have more potent antiviral activity than virus-specific CD8 T cells induced in the context of H-2b.15,27",

Furthermore, CD4 T-cell help during priming was dispensable for CNS accumulation and initial function of primary virus-specific CD8 effector T cells. However, uncontrolled CNS virus replication in the absence of CD4 T cells ultimately resulted in loss of IFN-\u03b3 production, higher CD8 T-cell turnover, and inability to acquire an effector memory phenotype. Nevertheless, the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype was rescued when virus replication was controlled by transfer of memory CD8 T cells, indicating that the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype during primary responses is regulated by antigen load, rather than lack of CD4 T-cell imprinting. By contrast, unhelped memory CD8 T cells mounted poor recall responses when transferred into CD4 T-cell-sufficient mice and could not be sustained in the CNS, despite efficient virus control.",

(\u223c2\u00b75 \u00d7 105), similar to CD8 T cells (\u223c5 \u00d7 105).29 To distinguish whether CD4 T cells affected CD8 T-cell recruitment and/or effector function following sublethal infection, CNS accumulation of virus-specific CD8 T cells was monitored. CD4 T-cell depletion did not alter the proportion of virus-specific T cells within the CD8 T-cell population infiltrating the brain or spinal cord (Fig.4a, data not shown). While the frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells were equally low at day 5 p.i., peak frequencies were reached by day 7 p.i. in both groups. Moreover, the absolute numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells were also similar at all times p.i. (Fig.4b), indicating that CD4 T cells were not required for virus-specific CD8 T-cell recruitment or retention. In the spinal cord virus-specific CD8 T cells were also virtually identical throughout infection, irrespective of the presence or absence of CD4 T cells during priming (Fig.4b). The failure to clear infectious virus in the absence of CD4 T cells (Fig.2c) therefore suggested either that the effector functions of CD8 T cells within the target tissue are impaired, or that CD4 T cells contribute directly to virus control.",

Cytolytic capacity of both unhelped and helped CD8 T cells showed no differences between the groups at day 7 p.i. (data not shown). Similarly, CD4 T-cell depletion did not impair the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells in brain-derived CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i. (Fig.5a). At day 14 p.i. the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing unhelped CD8 T cells remained similar to day 7 p.i., but was reduced relative to helped CD8 T cells. However, by day 21 p.i. the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing virus-specific CD8 T cells in the unhelped group declined to < 30%, whereas it was sustained at \u223c45% in controls. In addition to reduced frequencies, the extent of IFN-\u03b3 production as assessed by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was also lower in the unhelped groups at days 14 and 21 p.i. (Fig.5a). In spinal cords the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells were highest at day 7 p.i. and declined in both groups out to day 21 p.i., with no statistically significant differences between both groups (data not shown). Although a trend towards reduced IFN-\u03b3 secretion on a per cell basis was indicated by reduced MFI in the unhelped CD8 T-cell population, differences were not significant (data not shown). These results suggested that CD4 T cells support sustained IFN-\u03b3 expression by virus-specific CD8 T cells under conditions of prolonged antigen exposure.",

Interferon-\u03b3 mRNA expression in the brain was indeed reduced in the CNS of CD4-depleted mice compared with controls (Fig.5b). To assess functional IFN-\u03b3 protein in vivo we further monitored IFN-\u03b3 dependent up-regulation of CXCL9 mRNA and MHC class II on microglia. Decreased levels of CXCL9 mRNA supported reduced IFN-\u03b3 activity (Fig.5b). Moreover, MHC class II expression was barely detectable on microglia at day 5 p.i. in CD4-depleted mice, but was already up-regulated on 70% of microglia in controls (Fig.5c). Although > 98% of microglia in both groups expressed MHC class II by day 7 p.i., overall expression levels assessed by MFI were lower in CD4-depleted mice. CD8 T cells therefore produced sufficient IFN-\u03b3 in vivo to up-regulate MHC class II on microglia by day 7 p.i. in the absence of CD4 T cells. However, IFN-\u03b3 levels were insufficient to achieve optimal MHC class II induction, CXCL9 mRNA up-regulation, or control of infectious virus. Overall, these results support a defect in IFN-\u03b3 within the CNS, possibly due to the absence of CD4 T cells rather than impaired CD8 T-cell activity.",

Up-regulation of KLRG1 on effector T cells directly coincides with the magnitude of T-bet expression and serves as a marker of terminally differentiated effector cells.33,34 By contrast, CD127 is down-regulated upon activation, and activated cells with sustained CD127 expression survive the CD8 contraction phase to form the memory pool.35 Hence, during differentiation CD8 T cells expressing a CD127\u2212 KLRG1+ phenotype are generally considered to be short-lived effector cells (SLEC), whereas a CD127+ KLRG1\u2212 phenotype is indicative of long-lived memory precursor effector cells (MPEC).34",

By days 14 and 21 p.i. the proportion of KLRG1+ cells and SLEC within virus-specific CD8 T cells had dropped significantly in both groups, although SLEC continued to be higher in CD4-depleted mice (Fig6b). CD127+ KLRG1\u2212 MPEC were similarly low in both groups at day 5 p.i. and gradually increased throughout infection. However, whereas \u223c70% of helped virus-specific CD8 T cells exhibited an MPEC phenotype by day 21 p.i., this population only reached \u223c30% in CD4-depleted mice (Fig.6b). A minor fraction ranging from 5% to 20% of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressed both CD127 and KLRG1 throughout infection in both groups. Whereas this population increased with time p.i. in CD4-depleted mice, it decreased in controls that had cleared virus (Fig.6b). CD127 expression on KLRG1+ cells has been observed under conditions of repetitive antigen re-stimulation and may mark long-lived effector memory T cells.36,37 Overall, the proportion of KLRG1-expressing JHMV-specific CD8 T cells was relatively low compared with differentiation of SLEC during infection with viruses replicating in non-CNS tissues, e.g. following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection or following malaria parasite immunization.34,38,39 Weak KLRG1 expression may be attributed to the unique CNS environment and/or the redundant role of interleukin-12, a strong inducer of KLRG1, during JHMV infection.40 Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that early differences in virus-specific CD8 population arise from the absence of CD4 T cells during priming, whereas the significantly reduced efficacy to acquire an MPEC phenotype, coincident with retention of a larger proportion of SLEC, is driven by ongoing viral antigen stimulation.",

Consistent with similar numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS, their proliferation was comparable at \u223c85% at day 5 p.i. (Fig.6c). The proportions of proliferating virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS gradually declined in both groups starting at day 7 p.i. However, \u223c50% of unhelped CD8 T cells still showed evidence of proliferation at days 14 and 21 p.i., whereas proliferation by helped CD8 T cells had declined to \u223c25% (Fig.6c). These data suggest that elevated virus load sustains proliferation, yet also promotes activation-induced cell death. Indeed, while the frequency of apoptotic virus-specific CD8 T cells was similarly high in both groups at day 5 p.i., it remained significantly higher in CD4-depleted mice at day 14 p.i. (Fig.6c). Therefore, in the absence of CD4 T cells continued proliferation by virus-specific CD8 T cells was balanced by activation-induced cell death, resulting in comparable total numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS.",

To eliminate the variable effect of viral load in altering CD8 T cells, CD4-depleted infected mice received JHMV-specific memory CD8 T cells to reduce viral load.15 Memory CD8 T cells were derived from Thy-1.1 mice immunized with JHMV 3\u20134 weeks post immunization and transferred into JHMV-infected CD4-depleted or control Thy-1.2 recipients at day 5 p.i. This strategy allowed activation of endogenous CD8 T cells and monitoring of both donor and recipient T cells based on the Thy-1 congenic marker. Both CD4-depleted and control recipients developed mild signs of paralysis, and completely recovered from clinical symptoms by day 16 p.i. without mortality (Fig.7a). Donor memory CD8 T cells prevented mortality consistent with the inability to recover infectious virus at day 16 p.i. Flow cytometric analysis at day 16 p.i. confirmed essentially equivalent CNS recruitment of total as well as virus-specific Thy-1.1 donor CD8 T cells in both CD4-depleted and control recipients (Fig.7b,c). The vast majority of donor CD8 T cells recruited to the CNS were virus specific (60\u201370%), despite constituting only 2\u20133% of the donor population before transfer (data not shown). Virus-specific recipient Thy-1.2 CD8 T cells were slightly higher in the brain of CD4-depleted mice (Fig7d), whereas those in spinal cord were similar (Fig.7d, data not shown) confirming that endogenous CD8 T-cell populations were not skewed by the transfer (Fig.7d). Importantly, > 60% of virus-specific endogenous CD8 T cells in the CNS of CD4-depleted mice expressed a CD127+ KLRG1\u2212 MPEC phenotype at day 16 p.i. (Fig7e). The SLEC proportion was reduced to < 2%, showing a similar phenotype distribution as in control mice (Fig.7e). The relative MPEC and SLEC populations were also similar in spinal cords in both recipient groups (data not shown). The capacity of endogenous unhelped CD8 T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 was also restored to that of helped CD8 T cells (Fig.7f). These findings suggest that the altered phenotype of primary CNS CD8 T cells in CD4-depleted mice is mainly driven by sustained viral load, rather than lack of CD4 T-cell help or imprinting.",

To generate unhelped or helped donor memory CD8 T cells, Thy-1.1 mice were either treated with anti-CD4 or control mAb before JHMV immunization. Unhelped or helped memory Thy-1.1 CD8 T cells were transferred into naive Thy-1.2 recipients 1 day before infection. Mice with no donor T cells served as controls. Recipients of helped memory CD8 T cells displayed enhanced virus control at day 5 p.i., but all groups controlled infectious virus by day 14 p.i. (Fig.8a). However, in contrast to their helped memory counterparts or primary CD8 T cells (Figs1 and 4), unhelped virus-specific memory CD8 T cells were significantly impaired in expansion in the draining CLN, as well as early accumulation in the CNS, (Fig.8b). The relative proportion and total numbers of Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells was significantly lower in the unhelped, relative to helped, donor populations in both CLN as well the CNS at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig8b,c). The difference was most apparent at day 5 p.i. in the CNS and was largely resolved by day 14 p.i. Moreover, the number of virus-specific donor CD8 T cells capable of IFN-\u03b3 production was reduced in both CLN and CNS of recipients of unhelped versus helped memory CD8 T cells at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig.8d). Despite an apparent equilibration towards similar numbers of unhelped versus helped donor CD8 T cells in the CNS by day 14 p.i., survival of the unhelped memory CD8 T cells was profoundly reduced by day 35 p.i. during the chronic phase. Although helped donor Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells comprised \u223c25% of the total CD8 T-cell population, the proportion of unhelped CD8 T cells had declined > 98% (Fig.8e). This vast reduction was also reflected by the total numbers of unhelped versus helped Thy-1.1+ donor cells within the CNS (Fig.8e). Unhelped memory cells also failed to survive in the draining CLN (data not shown). Nonetheless, despite their low number, the relative proportion of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells was comparable between the groups (Fig.8f). These results suggest that CD4 T-cell help at priming plays an essential role in generating long-lasting memory T cells following recall responses within the CNS.",

Moreover, cytolytic activity was similar and IFN-\u03b3-producing virus-specific CD8 effector cells were equally abundant in the CNS regardless of the presence or absence of CD4 T cells during priming and acute infection. CNS CD8 T cells were nevertheless incapable of reducing infectious virus when primed without CD4 T cells, potentially because of delayed and suboptimal MHC up-regulation in the absence of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells. A role for CD4 help in maintaining effector function during prolonged antigen exposure was indicated by the decline in both the percentage and MFI of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells later in infection. The failure to clear infectious virus from the CNS in CD4-depleted mice also resulted in higher proliferation and apoptosis of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS, consistent with the inability to acquire an MPEC phenotype. Nevertheless, equilibration of viral load in CD4-depleted mice and controls by transfer of memory CD8 T cells revealed that the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype was prominently driven by viral load rather than the absence of CD4 T-cell imprinting.",

The inability to detect JHMV replication in CLN suggests a minimal influence of virus-driven pro-inflammatory responses, especially as type I IFN induction by JHMV is very low.44,45 Differences may rather reside in the magnitude and kinetics of antigen processing or peptide presentation as Ld restricted N protein-specific responses appear to arise earlier compared with Db-restricted S protein-specific responses.26 Moreover, the breadth of CD4 T-cell responses appear to differ, as numerous H-2b epitopes have been defined, while they appear more limited in H-2d mice.46,47 Irrespectively, uncontrolled viral replication despite intact accumulation of virus-specific CD8 T cells was the consequence of CD4 T-cell depletion in both H-2b and H-2d mice;9,10 while an early defect in CNS CD8 T-cell responses in infected H-2b mice suggested a local beneficial effect of CD4 T cells on CD8 T cells,9 a similar but more subtle effect in H-2d mice cannot be excluded. However, we have been unable to distinguish a direct contribution of CD4 T cells to viral control, e.g. via early IFN-\u03b3 secretion, from an indirect contribution to CD8 T-cell function involving antigen-presenting cells or soluble mediators. These findings imply that primary CD8 T-cell anti-viral immunity during encephalitis may vary significantly in an outbred population based on provision of CD4 T-cell help at multiple stages and anatomical locations. Nevertheless, irrespective of potentially distinct mechanisms, CD4 T cells appear essential for effective local anti-viral CD8 T-cell function in the CNS.",

Compared with their helped counterparts, JHMV-specific unhelped memory CD8 cells expanded less efficiently in the CLN, were delayed in CNS accumulation, and exhibited reduced survival. A potential mechanism underlying CD4 help is tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).48 Since helped CD8 T cells are capable of down-regulating TRAIL expression, they are less vulnerable to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.49 However, we previously reported that purified CD8 T cells from the CNS of CD4-depleted H-2b mice had only slightly increased transcript levels of TRAIL mRNA compared with controls.9 Whether TRAIL expression influences the limited expansion and survival of unhelped memory CD8 T cells in H-2d mice remains to be examined.",

Infection of oligodendrocytes, the primary targets of JHMV infection, is a prerequisite for demyelination but is insufficient to induce myelin stripping without T cells.13,15 In this context it is of interest to note that uncontrolled virus replication during persistence did not exacerbate demyelination in CD4-depleted mice. This contrasts with increased demyelination associated with similarly uncontrolled viral replication in mice deficient in humoral immunity29 and supports the notion that CD4 T cells promote pathology.19,23 Finally, it is interesting to note that uncontrolled viral replication in CD4-depleted H-2d mice resulted in viral spread to cells with neuronal morphology. While neuronal infection is sparse in immune competent mice, it is clearly evident under conditions of uncontrolled virus replication in infected IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient, B-cell deficient, as well as SCID mice,15,30,45 potentially contributing to the lethal phenotype.",

(e) Recipient virus-specific CD8 T cells were monitored for CD127 and KLRG1 expression to determine CD127+ KLRG1\u2212 memory precursor effector cells (MPEC) and CD127\u2212 KLRG1+ short-lived effector cells (SLEC) as indicated in Fig.6. (f) Intracellular interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production by recipient virus specific CD8 T cells were measured by incubation with pN peptide (1 \u03bcm) for 5\u20136 hr. Symbols represent individual mice. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance determined using an unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. **P < 0\u00b701.",

Helped or unhelped memory Thy-1.1 CD8 T cells (1\u00b72 \u00d7 106 to 1\u00b75 \u00d7 106 cells) were transferred into naive wild-type Thy-1.2 recipients 1 day before infection. (a) Virus titres in brains of recipients of helped or unhelped memory CD8 T cells and controls receiving no transfer. (b, c) Accumulation of memory Thy-1.1 donor CD8 T cells in central nervous system (CNS) and cervical lymph node (CLN) of neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) -infected recipients shown by proportion among CD8 T cells (b) and absolute number (c). (d) Cells derived from brain, spinal cord (SC) and CLN at days 5, 7 and 14 post-infection (p.i.) were stimulated with pN peptide (1 \u03bcm) for 5\u20136 hr and analysed for interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production. Data show absolute numbers of IFN-\u03b3 producing donor Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells from CNS and CLN. (e) Brain-derived mononuclear cells assessed for survival of donor Thy-1.1+ cells by flow cytometry at day 35 p.i. Density plot shows representative staining of donor Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells in the brain. Bar graphs represent absolute numbers of helped or unhelped donor Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells. (f) CNS-derived cells were incubated with pN peptide to determine IFN-\u03b3-producing Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. *P < 0\u00b705; **P < 0\u00b701; ***P < 0\u00b7001. Evaluation by analysis of variance showed slightly increased statistical significance for values in (b) for SC and CLN at day 7 and in (d) for CLN at day 5. By contrast, values in (b) for brain at day 14 and CLN at day 7, in (c) for brain and SC at day 5 and CLN at day 14, as well as (d) for brain at day 5 and 14, and SC and CLN at day 7 did not reach statistically significant differences.",
