            "text": "Tourist health and safety have arguably become among the most high profile issues now associated with the individual tourists' concerns with travel. Likewise, tourist destinations are increasingly being assessed in terms of their record on providing safe and healthy environments for tourists, given the central premise of tourism: to enjoy one's leisure time; to partake in a holiday which will involve \u2018periods of escape for people, and catalysts for change in both individuals and communities\u2019 (Ryan, 1997: 4). It is this holiday experience which features prominently in most analyses of the tourist experience (Ryan, 1997), and ensuring that the tourists' safety, health and enjoyment are key issues for the tourism industry. This is because the tourism industry sells dreams, potential experiences and seeks to fulfil our diverse motivation for domestic and international travel. Aside from the growing international growth in litigation and legal action associated with tourism when things go wrong, tour operators and destinations are increasingly realising that holidays need to perform a positive function in the post-modern society linked to reinvigoration of mind, body and soul, enjoyment, entertainment together with a wide range of needs associated with the imagery of holiday-taking.",

This even extends to the notion of tourists travelling in an \u2018environmental bubble\u2019 in countries where health and safety risks are significantly problematic, but where tour operators utilise exploitative modes of production such as resort enclaves, to ensure higher levels of profit but also to control the environment and risk factors. Through limited and managed interaction with the natural environment and local population, operators seek to provide positive tourist experiences of both place and the wider holiday by minimising risk situations. Given these now widely used management tools to seek to manage the tourist experience and to seek to create positive notions of well-being, this current issue's paper debates the issues associated with tourist holiday-taking and its management by the tourism industry, namely:\u2022tourist well-being and how accident, injury and perceived risk may impact upon it;\u2022the notion of a tourist welfare continuum;\u2022current issues and trends affecting the tourist risk and injury;\u2022what steps the tourism industry are taking to minimise the risks and incidence of injury.\n",

            "text": "Tourist travel is certainly not a new phenomenon and historical analyses of Scottish Missionaries between 1873 and 1929 highlighted the health risks which such travellers faced, especially to tropical areas, such as West Africa, where the most severe risks occurred (Cossar, 1987). Whilst few historical studies exist on other forms of tourist travel and the health issues which faced travellers prior to the post-war era, the existing studies do largely date to the 1970s (e.g. Steele, 1997), 1980s (e.g. Reid, Cossar, Ako, & Dewar, 1986) and 1990s (e.g. Cossar et al., 1990) and all these studies have come from the field of medicine known as epidemiology (i.e. the study of disease outbreaks and their propensity to grow to epidemics). These studies were certainly influential in creating what is now acknowledged as the field of travel medicine which some commentators consider has evolved from the area of tropical medicine. As\nFig. 1 shows, travel medicine has developed from a wide range of medical specialisms and contributions made from science and social science. Indeed, the area of study has its own International Society of Travel Medicine with a well-established scientific journal \u2013 the Journal of Travel Medicine and a more recent newcomer \u2013 Travel Medicine and Infectious Diseases. A range of textbooks on travel medicine aimed at the medical profession also exist which underpin three key principles of travel medicine:\u2022providing specialist medical advice to impending travellers with a view to preventing risks and morbidity associated with travel (A Prevention Role);\u2022assessment of known or likely hazards associated with a specific form of tourist travel and the prescribing of prophylactics to reduce risks (Risk Assessment);\u2022generic health advice and information to advise travellers of necessary behavioural issues associated with travel to certain areas and destinations (Information Role). This is epitomised in\nFig. 2 which is an analysis of the UK Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Travel Advisories of areas which UK tourists should avoid travel to. Whilst such a geographical distribution of destinations to avoid will change through time, it does highlight the importance on informing potential tourists of areas of political instability and areas of a high propensity for kidnapping of tourists (e.g. some South American destinations).\n",

Seeking to synthesise the diverse scientific literature is a near impossible task, with literally hundreds to thousands of relevant articles available from proprietary academic search engines (e.g. Google, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, Medline and Science Direct) which collate the scientific publications in the area. For readers, the more gentle introduction to this vast literature can be more easily accessed by charting some of the landmark books in the field since the early 1990s. Any review of the scientific literature points to the 1990s as the \u2018take off\u2019 point of literature in this area which also coincides with the launch of the Journal of Travel Medicine. Yet this may be a reflection of the relabelling of research activity that already existed for decades before, with a more explicit \u2018travel medicine\u2019 label. A brief review of\nTable 1 which documents the history of travel medicine articles in the international medical journal \u2013 The Lancet, does show a diversity of publications grouped around many of the subjects listed in Fig. 1. Interestingly, these travel medicine issues have a history dating to the 1890s. This would seem to suggest that the study of travel medicine may have expanded somewhat by the 1990s (e.g. Behrens & McAdam, 1993) but it is a well-defined area of scientific inquiry dating back to the nineteenth century, with much of the original impetus linked to the positive health giving qualities of ocean travel. This has gradually changed to recognise that travel may also provide a range of health risks for certain groups of travellers. Of course, such an interest can also be dated back much further to the development of water therapy at hydro hotels (Durie, 2006) where the health benefits of tourism were promoted and medical articles were used to extol the benefits of such therapy.",

This illustrates the importance of the prevention\u2013risk assessment\u2013information role not only during travel preparations but also on when on holiday and when returning. The widely argued premise among social psychologists is that the need for travel medicine is predicated on the assumption that tourists' behaviour changes when on holiday, compared to that in the origin area. Debates associated with the tourist experience on hedonism, behaviour change and the cultural significance of holidays in shaping these changes remain contentious and complex to unravel (Ryan, 1997). However, as many empirical studies of traveller behaviour and the propensity to experience health problems (e.g. Cossar et al., 1990) confirms, many travellers engage in much more risky behaviour, either consciously or sub-consciously. One outcome, as Behrens (1997) found among returning travellers to Australia from less developed countries, was that around 50% reported illness on their return. Without engaging in a detailed debate on the causes of such illness rates, it is still apparent that the core area of tropical medicine has a core role to play in travel medicine if one examines\nFig. 4. Fig. 4 illustrates the scale and volume of international tourist travel to less developed countries using recent UN-World Tourism Organisation statistics.

At a global scale, the likelihood of a global flu pandemic will certainly modify tourist travel patterns away from affected areas. In addition, the affected areas would most likely see their tourism sector respond in much the same way that SARS (Lumsdon & Page, 2004) led to the rapid loss of inbound tourism to destinations like Hong Kong where a 70% drop in the market occurred. Yet the important point to stress here, is the point at which the World Health Organisation declares a pandemic is in existence, and thereby triggering a downshift in global and regional travel. The same principle also applies with reference to many of the other issues listed in Table 2. It is the point at which the media and tourist perception leads to a reaction against travel to regions affected by specific problems, triggering a behaviour change that is critical for the tourism industry and destinations. This is probably much clearer with reference to more tangible and easily understood human risks such as terrorism or a natural disaster as opposed to medical or health risks that are less tangible. Even so, tourist travel still has a considerable propensity to recover after the issue has subsided from media attention and travel behaviour begins to see a degree of normality return. This was evident in the case of SARS, where recovery in passenger loadings on Asian airlines 6 months after the event signalled recovery (Page, 2005).",

What is more significant is that tourist behaviour and the social psychology of tourist perception of risk varies considerably according to traveller type. Yet interestingly, the trigger point for the majority of travellers is crucial in determining their aversion to a greater risk once it is associated with the media. Fig. 4 is a real indicator of the willingness of international travellers to visit the tropical environments which have among the greatest background levels of disease and health risks in part, due to the attraction imagery and promotion of their idyllic and exotic qualities. Yet avoidance of such destinations only occurs after a concerted media campaign or travel advisory. This reiterates the arguments made earlier that tourists are more willing to subject themselves to a wide range of risk factors whilst on holiday compared to those they would be prepared to experience in their home environment. It is only once risk aversion behaviour is positively triggered by the media or other information sources (i.e. the unwillingness of travel insurers to provide cover) that avoidance occurs in many cases. Again, this is a somewhat simplified argument, but it should be qualified by recognising that different types of travellers do seek various experiences and the propensity to seek safe through to extremely challenging and adventurous experiences. So, what do these conceptual issues and reflections on tourists' behaviour and travel mean for practical management measures the tourism sector?",

There are varying debates on this. These range from the perspective that each traveller is an adult and should be responsible for their own actions; to government's and other public sector agencies have a responsibility to ensure that all tourism providers develop a duty of care for their guests and visitors. This means ensuring a safe, healthy and meaningful experience that is as authentic as possible without being artificial and over-managed. In reality, the situation in different countries, sectors of the tourism industry and cultural determinants of tourist provision lead to many different attitudes to tourist safety and well-being. This determines the type of risk factors which visitors may experience in any destination or country, where the legal and regulatory environment may be a good surrogate for the operational guidelines which businesses must adhere to.",

Among the most proactive measures now in place following the DVT debate associated with long-haul travel, are the issuing of guidelines to passengers to encourage in-flight exercise to reduce immobility. Yet these are only paid lip service by many airlines to reduce possible grounds for litigation. At an international scale, the IATA minimum space for aircraft seat pitch still remains at 26 in although some international carriers have expanded pitch size to 32 in. This is still pitifully inadequate and reflects the commercial pressure on airlines to increase passenger yields by reducing legroom. However, until more conclusive research is published on the link between cramped airline travel conditions, DVT and poor passenger health/well-being, this commercial model seems set to remain in place. The examples of Best Practice examined by Wilks (2002) provide a good overview of how measures to improve tourist well-being have been developed across the tourism sector. A cynic might argue that much of this activity has resulted from the growing concerns in travel and tourism law (Grant, Mason, Khan, & Davis, 2005) that tourists will pursue litigation as one option to seek redress when unnecessary risk of injury occurs. Equally, there is growing evidence of tourists also using litigation to seek redress for non-health or medical issues, such as emotional stress caused by a disappointing holiday through to trivial issues like lost luggage. It is this litigation and the rising costs of tourism insurance which have force some sectors of the tourism industry to reduce the necessity of claims.",

This places undue pressure on inadequately funded public health systems, where cost recovery for accident and emergency treatment is not a common occurrence. Whilst Bentley et al. (2001) observed that many injuries are minor, largely in the slips, trips and falls category, and they do pose problems for health systems. The interaction between the public sector tourism and health systems is weakly developed, and it offers considerable scope for developing Best Practice models to reduce tourist injuries, accidents and morbidity. Here, the role of travel medicine has a role to play in risk assessment and prevention at the pre-travel phase but also a greater reinforcement in the destination area. Where voluntary cooperation and safety management is not practical or feasible, then legislation by government agencies is required, in areas such as food hygiene and handling where international standards exist.",

If we do, as Page, Bentley, and Walker (2005) noted, then tourist experiences will cease to be fun, exciting, different and could become artificial and too stage-managed. That is certainly not in the interest of the tourism industry, which is in the business of fulfilling dreams, desires and ambitions. The challenge is to balance the need for the provision of an exciting or meaningful experience with a realistic assessment of the risks involved to tourist health, so that visitor well-being is safeguarded where practicable but not to the point of wrapping participants in cotton wool. Much of what the international tourism industry provides is of a standard where risk factors are known to the operators, but only slowly is that being made more transparent to visitors. To provide a full outline of all known risks and likely injuries would detract from the experience of a holiday. Therefore, balancing what the tourist needs to be told versus what is actually disclosed is now a contentious but burgeoning issue. Operators are increasingly being required to disclose risks to travellers in brochures and on web sites so insurance risks can be calculated and cover provided. The tourism sector does not operate as a seamless business, despite the role of large multinational integrated operators, and travel medicine issues highlight many of the inherent flaws in their modus operandi. Whilst the most advanced operators do track risk and injury issues via customer surveys and complaints, their approach in the main is still reactive because responsibility for tourist well-being is largely an outcome of what happens in the destination. As a result, much of this is outside of the immediate control of the tour operator, and within the remit of the destinations public and private sector tourism industry. The differing approaches of destinations to such issues also gives rise to a lack of consistency in the management of tourist health and safety, since human behaviour changes on holiday and the public sector have varying approaches and attitudes to how such behaviour should be managed.",
