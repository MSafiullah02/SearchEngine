HMPV RNA was relatively quantified in nasopharyngeal swabs. In order to standardise the quantification of hMPV RNA, a recombinant plasmid was used in serial dilutions covering a range of 6 logs. The criteria for a positive reaction were a cycle threshold of <40 cycles and a fluorescence count of >0.5. The minimum genome viral load that would allow reproducible quantification was 10 copies per reaction, corresponding to 500 copies/mL of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen. Virologic results were not available to the clinicians.",

Further 12-month studies that included more than 1 year of surveillance and more hMPV positive cases should be performed to confirm our results and to establish the utility of viral load is evaluating an individual case. Moreover, patients attending an Emergency Room may not be fully representative of the disease in the community, and may select for more severe disease. Furthermore, since we determined a relative quantification of viral load, and considering that the efficiency of this method was not 100%, our measures of viral load could be underestimates. However, these limitations do not modify the observed relation between high viral load and clinical severity. In addition, there were cases in which the PCR results did not permit hMPV classification into type A or B because viral load was not high enough to obtain a good amplification product for sequencing. In our study untyped cases were 12 out of 60 (20%). However, the absence of differences between hMPV A, hMPV B, untyped cases with or without co-infections support our conclusions. Finally, although we observed a relationship between high hMPV load and presence of secondary cases among household members, which were similar to the disease in our index cases, secondary cases were not virologically studied. Consequently, these cases could have many other causes, including the co-pathogens when they were present.",
