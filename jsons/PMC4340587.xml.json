            "text": "Protein synthesis at the ribosome involves the translation of a messenger RNA (mRNA), which is threaded through the space between the small and large ribosomal subunits (in eukaryotes, 40S and 60S). The amino acids are delivered to the ribosome by adaptor molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which recognize triplet codons of nucleic acid bases on mRNA with their anticodons. The tRNAs occupy a series of specific positions in the intersubunit space, known as the aminoacyl (A), peptidyl (P), and exit (E) sites. Translocation of tRNAs between these sites while still attached to the mRNA is the basis of ribosomal processivity along the mRNA and the maintenance of a single reading frame (Moazed and Noller, 1989, Rodnina et al., 1997). After peptide bond formation, the acceptor ends of the A and P site tRNAs move with respect to the large ribosomal subunit, but the anticodon ends remain in their original positions relative to the small ribosomal subunit, to yield hybrid-state tRNA intermediates P/E and A/P (Moazed and Noller, 1989). This process is facilitated by ratcheting of the ribosome, whereby the small and large subunits rotate with respect to one another by \u223c6\u00b0 (Frank and Agrawal, 2000). Complete translocation of the mRNA-tRNA complex into the E and P sites is catalyzed by a monomeric G protein, elongation factor 2 (EF-2), with associated GTP hydrolysis (Noller et al., 2002, Wilden et al., 2006). The finite occupation by translocating tRNAs of an A/P hybrid state has been demonstrated by kinetic methods (Dorner et al., 2006) and represents one of a series of hybrid positions that have been inferred between both A and P and P and E sites. Although kinetic and biophysical studies have been especially important in identifying hybrid states (Rodnina et al., 1997, Wilden et al., 2006, Dorner et al., 2006, Blanchard et al., 2004, Pan et al., 2007), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has also allowed their visualization, including a P/E hybrid state with the tRNA anticodon in the P site and acceptor arm in the E site (Taylor et al., 2007) and an A/P hybrid state close to the A site with a near-native tRNA conformation (Juli\u00e1n et al., 2008). Single-molecule kinetic studies have revealed that a number of kinetically distinct states are occupied by tRNAs during their passage from A to P sites (Wen et al., 2008). Indeed, we recently observed by cryo-EM a previously unanticipated A/P hybrid state tRNA with significant anticodon stem loop distortion (Namy et al., 2006). Our analysis was of an actively translating rabbit reticulocyte 80S ribosomal complex stalled by an mRNA pseudoknot structure (Brierley et al., 2007) derived from the programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting signal of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Brierley et al., 1989). In this complex, the hybrid state tRNA, which we termed A/P', is associated with EF-2 (Namy et al., 2006). The A/P' tRNA adopts a bent conformation as if it had the properties of a spring, and in this complex it was observed for the first time in direct contact with the translocase (Namy et al., 2006). On the basis of these observations we suggested that EF-2 acts as a Brownian ratchet within a \u201cspring and ratchet\u201d system to generate stepwise directional movement of the whole complex, facilitating translocation (Moran et al., 2008). The bending of the A/P' hybrid state observed by us (Namy et al., 2006) is similar to, but greater in magnitude than, that previously observed during tRNA accommodation into the A site (Valle et al., 2002). EF-2 seems to create this transition state prior to movement of tRNA into the P site proper (Namy et al., 2006, Moran et al., 2008) and the pause-step-pause movement of the ribosome-tRNA complex along the mRNA that this model infers is in agreement with the kinetics of single translocating ribosomes (Wen et al., 2008). The hybrid state giving rise to this interpretation is one that occurs in the presence of the translocase; the other A/P state since observed is an example of one that can form spontaneously (Juli\u00e1n et al., 2008).",

The stem loop-stalled ribosomes (80SSL) contain a single tRNA in a canonical P site, as previously observed (Namy et al., 2006), while the pseudoknot-stalled ribosomes (80SPK) contain structurally distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states. In the first (A/P\u2032), the tRNA is in contact with the translocase EF-2, as previously observed (Namy et al., 2006), and appears to be in the process of translocation (Moran et al., 2008). In the second (A/P\u2033), the tRNA is found in the absence of EF-2, but has failed to complete translocation and instead has, presumably, slipped back toward the A site. The existence of A/P\u2032 and A/P\u2033 hybrid states provides more direct, detailed information on tRNA trajectories than previously observed and we hypothesize that the translocase EF-2 may be able to cycle on to and off from the ribosome during a single round of translocation in a manner important for resolving secondary structures such as stem loops and pseudoknots within mRNAs.",

            "text": "Ribosome-mRNA complexes were assembled and purified as described in\nFigure 1 and in the Experimental Procedures. In vitro transcribed RNAs containing the IBV minimal pseudoknot or a related stem loop structure were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) under conditions where the majority of ribosomes become stalled at these structures (Namy et al., 2006; see Supplemental Information available online). At this point, the complexes were stabilized by addition of cycloheximide, purified by affinity chromatography, and subjected to cryo-EM. A total of 38,720 images of the stem loop-stalled RRL ribosome (80SSL) sample were analyzed and, selecting by tRNA occupancy (see Experimental Procedures), 24,738 (64%) of them were reconstructed to yield a reconstruction at 13.6 \u00c5 resolution (see below). This process of focused classification (Allen et al., 2005, Gilbert et al., 2007) made use of a spherical mask minimizing the chance of mask-induced bias in the image selection (see Supplemental Information). The data set of pseudoknot-stalled RRL ribosomes (80SPK) consisted of 64,413 images and was initially reconstructed allowing for two ribosomal states: inactive and unbound by ligands or bound with an A/P\u2032 hybrid state tRNA and EF-2 and engaged with the pseudoknot (80SPK-tRNA-EF-2) (Namy et al., 2006, Moran et al., 2008). The resulting maps were of limited resolution (\u223c17 \u00c5) for the data quality, given the resolution achieved with the 80SSL complex from 24,738 images (13.6 \u00c5) and had a weaker representation of EF-2 than for the tRNA (\nFigures 2A and 2B). This led us to hypothesize that the tRNA may have a higher occupancy in the sample than EF-2, as later demonstrated by omit analysis (Supplemental Information; Figure 2C). We therefore set about refining the 80SPK data set into three groups (see Experimental Procedures), allowing for the ribosomes being either inactive (80SApo), stalled with a tRNA engaged with EF-2 (80SPK-tRNA-EF-2), or stalled with a tRNA alone (80SPK-tRNA). The refined 80SPK-tRNA-EF-2 reconstruction was calculated from 20,215/64,413 images (31%) to a resolution of 15.3 \u00c5 and the refined 80SPK-tRNA reconstruction from 24,494/64,413 images (38%) to a resolution of 14.9 \u00c5. Thus the PK-stalled complexes in the 80SPK preparation account for 69% of the sample, as previously estimated in a two-way segmentation (Namy et al., 2006), which supports the validity of both our current image classification and the previously published results. The details of the 80SSL, 80SPK-tRNA-EF-2, and 80SPK-tRNA complexes are discussed below. All resolutions in this paper have been estimated using the FSC = 0.5 criterion (Figure S1A). Some factors to consider in presenting cryo-EM reconstructions are the method by which the structure factor amplitudes are corrected and the contour level for map display. We corrected our data amplitudes along lines proposed by Rosenthal and Henderson (2003) (see Supplemental Information and Figure S1C). Our resolution estimate is confirmed by the presence of distinguishable RNA helices in our maps (Figure S1B). The conclusions of our work rely on assessment of the presence of EF-2 in our structures and the conformations of the tRNAs between the A and P sites of the intersubunit space. The omit analysis detailed above objectively addresses the question of the presence of EF-2 and tRNA, and our subsequent use of a supervised classification procedure shows there are two different kinds of hybrid state tRNA. We set the contour levels of all our maps by reference to the atomic model for a mammalian ribosome built on the basis of a canine ribosome reconstruction at 8.7 \u00c5 resolution (Chandramouli et al., 2008). This allowed us to encompass most of an atomic model based on this higher resolution structure within our maps. A few features remained outside the contoured surface, which were all at the periphery of the structure. We removed them from our atomic models when displaying them in the main paper but have shown them in Figure S2. We cannot be sure why these features are not clearly resolved in our maps but suspect this is due to either conformational flexibility or their being loosely associated with the ribosomes\u2014both possibilities highlighted by their localization to the periphery of the structure (see Supplemental Information for more details).",

In the 80SSL reconstruction, the tRNA occupies the P site proper, into which it has successfully translocated. As in our previous analysis of this complex (Namy et al., 2006) we cannot see any density for the stem loop itself, which we think is due to its conformational flexibility. The affinity-based method of complex purification (see Experimental Procedures) means that the stem loop-containing mRNA must be present in the ribosomal complexes. Further evidence that the ribosome particles used to compute this reconstruction are successfully stalled on the mRNA comes from the density present in the large subunit tunnel, which is consistent with an extended eight residue peptide (\nFigure 4A; Figures S3A\u2013S3D) and matches that found in the PK-stalled complexes (Figure 4A). This suggests that all three complexes are successfully stalled and bound to the mRNA. Difference maps that compare programmed and empty ribosomes do not reveal any significant occupancy of the ribosomal A or E sites in our complexes. The lack of an A site tRNA probably reflects that these complexes are in, or approaching, a post-translocation state and, being stalled, have not refilled the A site. The absence of the E site tRNA may be explicable in terms of loss during the sucrose gradient and column chromatography steps of complex purification, as noted by others (Beckmann et al., 2001). Other possibilities include our use of cycloheximide to stabilize complexes or structural changes in the L1 stalk, either of which could influence E site occupancy (Pestova and Hellen, 2003, M\u00e1rquez et al., 2004).",

We refer to the previously observed EF-2-engaged tRNA as being in an A/P\u2032 state (Pan et al., 2007, Moran et al., 2008) and to the unengaged tRNA, by extension, as being in the A/P\u2033 state. Averaging the density seen for EF-2 and the tRNA in the 80SPK-tRNA-EF-2 complex with that seen in the 80SPK-tRNA complex gives density very similar to that seen in our previous analysis of this structure (Namy et al., 2006) (Figure S4C).

This allowed us to generate plausible models for A/P\u2032 and A/P\u2033 tRNAs and for the engaged EF-2 (Figures 4C and 4E), which firmly underscore the differences in tRNA conformation found between the various states observed in stem loop- and pseudoknot-stalled ribosomes. Engaged with EF-2, the A/P\u2032 tRNA is compressed toward the intersubunit face of the 60S large subunit and the anticodon arm is bent, as seen previously (Namy et al., 2006) (Figure 4C, right panel). In the absence of EF-2, the tRNA is not pushed up toward the large subunit face or compressed, but has a dramatic bend toward the A site (clearly shown in Figure 4C, left panel; see also Figure S5A). Thus, tRNA compression toward the roof of the P site and bending of the anticodon arm in one direction is produced by EF-2, whereas anticodon bending in a different direction is likely created by pseudoknot-derived mRNA tension. Normal modes-assisted fitting of EF-2 showed domains I, II, and G' to have remained relatively rigid and to be similar in conformation to that found in Apo and sordarin-bound EF-2 (Jorgensen et al., 2003), but that domains III\u2013V are rotated \u223c90\u00b0 about them with respect to EF-2-sordarin (Figures 4D and 4E; Figures S5B\u2013S5D). In the 80S ribosome bound with sordarin-fixed EF-2 (Spahn et al., 2004), the L1 stalk of the large subunit occludes the E site, but in our complex containing EF-2 in an active conformation we note that it remains open (\nFigure 5A). Thus tRNA procession out of the intersubunit space at the conclusion of translocation will be unhindered, providing another possible explanation for the lack of E site tRNAs in our stalled complexes as mentioned above. A distinctive feature of the EF-2-containing complex is the way in which the A site finger appears to be deployed over the join between EF-2 domains I, II, and G' and EF-2 domains III\u2013IV (Figure 5B) in a manner consistent with its role as an attenuator of uncontrolled, out-of-register ribosomal movement (Korostelev et al., 2006, Komoda et al., 2006) since it appears thereby to fasten EF-2 within its binding site. EF-2 appears to remain in the stalled complex through the maintenance of native interactions with the elongating ribosome, which as a whole has been stalled by engagement with the pseudoknot. However, these interactions may be weaker than those holding the tRNAs in place, further within the intersubunit space, as suggested by the EF-2 partial occupancy.",

EF-2 seems to hold the A/P\u2032 tRNA tight up against this gate and in this, to push the tRNA toward the intersubunit face of the 60S large subunit. The tautness of the 80SPK-tRNA-EF-2 complex compared to the 80SPK-tRNA one is further indicated by the position of the pseudoknot, which juts out orthogonally from the proposed small subunit helicase center (Takyar et al., 2005, Namy et al., 2006) in the former case, but is relaxed downwards in the latter (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, the movement of the A/P\u2033 tRNA is consistent with a key role of the translocase to prevent slippage and to act by biasing forward translocation into the P site (Moran et al., 2008).",

            "text": "We have shown the translocase EF-2 is substoichiometric, bringing about the adoption of a novel A/P\u2033 hybrid state, which joins the A/P\u2032 state previously described (Namy et al., 2006) and the more recent A/P state occurring spontaneously (Juli\u00e1n et al., 2008) as A-to-P intermediates that have been seen directly. There are a number of possible explanations for the absence of EF-2 in ribosomal complexes containing the A/P\u2033 hybrid state tRNA. These include that the hybrid state has arisen spontaneously before EF-2 has bound, that EF-2 was present but has been lost during complex purification, that tRNAs that have completed translocation can reverse translocate into this position, and that EF-2 can cycle off the ribosome during attempted translocation and then rejoin it to complete the process. While a spontaneously formed A/P\u2033 tRNA is conceivable, it seems unlikely for several reasons: there is a high occupancy of it in the sample (38% in total, which corresponds to 55% of the stalled ribosomes), it has not previously been observed despite numerous studies of tRNA positions within the ribosome, and the tRNA is highly distorted. The possibility that EF-2 has fallen out of the complexes during their purification and thus induced the A/P\u2033 state can be evaluated by reference to the completeness of the rest of the complexes. It is known that the accessory ribosomal protein RACK1 is peripherally associated with the small subunit head and that it is labile (Sengupta et al., 2004), yet in all three stalled complexes, it is fully present, both in the reconstruction (Figure S3E) and as judged by western blotting (Figure S6). Since the rest of each ribosome appears by this test to be complete, it is likely that the EF-2 has not disassociated during purification. It seems unlikely that the A/P\u2033 state could have arisen through spontaneous reverse translocation subsequent to successful placement of tRNA into the P site, because movement back over the A/P gate would have been uncatalyzed or otherwise unstimulated (Shoji et al., 2006, Konevega et al., 2007). We believe the most plausible hypothesis to be that the A/P\u2033 state has arisen as a result of EF-2 enacting its reaction cycle without achieving completion of translocation. According to this explanation, EF-2 would bind and undergo GTP hydrolysis, induce a hybrid state such as A/P\u2032, but leave before the P site has been reached, leading to backward slippage of the tRNA toward the A site and into the A/P\u2033 state. Since the A/P\u2033 tRNA-containing ribosomes identified in this study are not \u201cdead-end\u201d products\u2014in translation assays virtually all IBV PK-stalled complexes chase to completion (Somogyi et al., 1993, Kontos et al., 2001)\u2014this suggests that EF-2 can cycle repeatedly on to and off from the ribosome during single translocation steps. The likelihood of such cycling would be increased by the presence of mRNA secondary structures, especially mRNA pseudoknots, given their capacity to pause ribosomes (Somogyi et al., 1993) and their greater resistance to mechanical unfolding (Green et al., 2008).",

Consistent with this view, pseudoknot-induced mRNA tension is likely to put a strain on the codon-anticodon complex of the A/P\u2032 hybrid state tRNA, and uncoupling of the tRNA from the mRNA would conceivably lead to loss of EF-2. However, the sequence of the mRNA in the decoding site of the stalled complexes studied here does not contain a slippery sequence (Jacks et al., 1988) and is GC rich (Namy et al., 2006; see Figure 1). Previous studies have shown that GC-rich stretches do not permit efficient RNA secondary structure-dependent frameshifting, and by analogy, the tRNAs decoding these sequences are less prone to detach from the mRNA (Jacks et al., 1988, Brierley et al., 1992). We thus consider the A/P\u2033 state to have arisen as a result of the failure of EF-2 to complete translocation rather than as a consequence of an attempt to frameshift.",

In a single-ribosome kinetic study (Wen et al., 2008) it has recently been shown that ribosomes translocate through mRNA hairpins by stepwise movements separated by pauses. Measuring the times taken for translocation to occur and the dwell time (the time between translocation events, consisting of the pause time plus the translocation time), the authors were able to show that while the dwell time displays a distribution that indicates two or more successive rate-limiting processes, the translocation time appears to involve three similar or identical substeps (Wen et al., 2008). The different positions of translocating tRNAs that we observe would fit with these data.",

The difference density between the 80SPK structure and an 80SApo ribosome is shown in white.

In green is the difference map for the previously determined 80SPK complex versus the displayed empty form of the ribosome. The difference density illustrates the presence of the pseudoknot (PK), tRNA in a bent conformation (tRNA), and translocase (EF-2). In blue is the difference map obtained by aligning the new data set of 80SPK images described in this paper with the displayed 80SApo map. (C) Omit analysis of the tRNA and EF-2 density. The top panel shows the difference density for the tRNA and EF-2 portions of the structure, as in (B) (but rotated 90\u00b0 counterclockwise), with the previously published difference map (Namy et al., 2006) colored green and that calculated from the new 80SPK data set analyzed here in blue. The result of the omit analysis is shown in the bottom panel. The difference map for tRNA and EF-2 from the omit analysis is shown at two contour levels (blue and red) to demonstrate the relatively weak translocase density when the tRNA maintains its essential form. The green density is as above. The density for EF-2 is weaker and less well formed than that of the tRNA, indicating in the context of this omit analysis that they have different occupancies.",
