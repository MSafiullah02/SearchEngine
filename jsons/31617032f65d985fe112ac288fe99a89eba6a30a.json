When the virus enters the cell, the viral genome begins to replicate and translates structural proteins. After the process inside the cytoplasm, the vesicles containing the virus particles fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus. After the entry of virus to the cell, antigen presentation cells (APC) -the main part of antiviral immunity-begin to present the antigens. Afterward, antigen presentation subsequently stimulates virus-specific B and T cells and they mediate the body's humoral immunity and immunoglobulin M and G production begins. Specific IgM antibodies disappear approximately at the end of 12th week. IgG antibody lasts for a longer time and the SARS-specific IgG antibodies primarily are S-specific and N-specific antibodies [12] . There are more researches on the cellular immunity of coronavirus compared to humoral immunity [8] . The current data seems to indicate that the viral infection is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. In some cases, a 'cytokine storm' occurs of which the effect is extensive tissue damage. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) triggers this storm, which is produced by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues. This cytokine storm may result in an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction [8] .",

Suggested reasons include having a more active innate immune response, healthier respiratory tracts (because of not exposing to cigarette smoke and air pollution as adults), and fewer underlying disorders. In addition, they are generally overprotected by parents, and if there is not any positive case in family, the possibility of being infected decreases [15] . A dangerous and uncontrolled immune response in adults may also explain with a robust immune response which may lead to ARDS [15] . It was found that ACE2 expression in rat lung has been found to dramatically decrease with age [15] . This finding may not be consistent with a relatively low susceptibility of children to COVID-19. On the other hand, studies show that ACE2 is involved in protective mechanisms of the lung. It may protect against severe lung injury induced by respiratory virus infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients [16, 17] . The difference between adults and children in case of severity may be related to differences in receptors in the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and altered inflammatory responses to pathogens [18] .",

In pregnancy, viremia rates seem to be low, shown as 1% in Wang's report [22] . This finding suggests that placental seeding and vertical transmission is unlikely. In Schwartz's review, 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported, and, no cases of intrauterine transmission were documented [23] . On the other hand, many possible cases have been reported that presenting newborns delivered from COVID-19 pregnants, with increased Ig m levels but negative polymerase chain reaction tests results after cesarean delivery or reports presenting neonatal pneumonia due to COVID-19, with nasopharyngeal and anal cultures and polymerase chain reaction tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2.",

If breast milk of these mothers tested negative for 2019-nCoV, then infants may be fed with breast milk. Using donor milk can be considered after being screened for 2019-nCoV, in case of excretion of the virus into the milk during the incubation period [25] . On contrary, another study presented that no virus was found in the maternal milk of six COVID-19 patients [26] .

WHO suggests that women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. However, it is mentioned that there is still a risk for droplet transmission via close contact during feeding (breastfeeding or bottle feeding). So, it is important to carry out precautions to prevent transmission. Mothers should practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available, wash hands before and after touching the baby, and routinely clean and disinfect what they have touched 5 .",

In case of circulation dysfunction, vasoactive drugs may be used to improve microcirculation [6] . In children, epinephrine is considered first-line, while norepinephrine can be added if shock persists despite the optimal dose of epinephrine. Continuous blood purification should be considered in cases of multiple organ failure (especially acute kidney injury), or capacity overload and life-threatening imbalance of water, electrolyte, and acid-base. If combined with liver failure, plasma exchange is feasible. 13 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure ARDS, so it may also be effective in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
