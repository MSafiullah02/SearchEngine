Here we present a comparative study of the performance of states of India, in curbing the spread of the disease, that are most affected by the pandemic. We have done so based on the data collected between 14 th March, 2020 to 17 th April, 2020. We do this by comparing the smoothened time series and percentage changes along with change point detection of the daily confirmed cases. We also discuss the different policies and strategies adopted by the states in curbing the disease and the ground level implementation. We have developed ARIMA(p,d,q) models where (p,d,q) are obtained by minimising the AIK(Akaike Information Criterion). These models are used to make forecasts for the country which show that by 7 th May, 2020, India would have around 50,237 confirmed cases and a doubling rate of 11 days. On the basis of the performance, of each state, we argue that a local level strategy which is based on the demographics of that particular region be developed instead of a central and uniform one.",

As of 27 th April, 2020, over 2,810,325 people have been infected with the disease and 193,825 have deceased [17] in over 213 countries. Such rapid spread of the virus has mainly been successful due to a lack of preventive measures in the initial days of the outbreak, vast volume of international travel and its mode of infection i.e. through personal contact and aerosols [27] . In order to contain the virus China was the first country to impose a full lock down of the epicentre of the virus, i.e. Hubei province, on the 23 rd of March 2020 [18] . Subsequently a similar strategy was adopted in Italy [25] and later on in several parts of the world.",

The ministry of health and family welfare, responsible for controlling the disease, has maintained its stand that the epidemic is in the second stage i.e. local transmission. The socio-economic impact of community transmission, of SARS-COV-2 in India, could be devastating, Jha et al. in their paper [10] ,discussed the possibility of community transmission in India and its capability to tackle an uncontrolled outbreak. They argued in the light of availability of resources such as regular and ICU beds, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) for health care workers and the number of doctors, and suggest three possible methods to curb the spread, which are isolation of the infected, quarantine and social distancing. With a population of 1.3 billion people it is a real challenge to identify and isolate individuals in case of community transmission. Several measures were taken by the Govt. of India in order to curb and control the spread of SARS-COV-2. Initially passengers, coming from highly affected countries like China, South Korea, Germany and Italy, were screened and home quarantined and later all flights were grounded and international travel halted [5, 12] . The Govt. of India declared a country-wide lock down on the 25 th of March,2020 [8] , while some states like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra and Assam did so earlier on the 23 rd of March, 2020 [9, 11, 15, 16] .",

A nation-wide study is very helpful for the central government to implement policies but a further study is required to device a state-wise strategy for dealing with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19) pandemic. As it is obvious from the data that not every state in the country is affected equally and in a similar manner, for instance, Maharashtra has over 5000 confirmed cases (as of 1012 hrs, Thursday, 23 April 2020 (IST)) [23] whereas Jharkhand, Tripura, Mizoram or Goa have below 50, and hence it is necessary to study the spread of the virus in each of these most affected states separately.",

These percentage changes are plotted for each state and studied by isolating them into three components,(a) pre-lock down to start of lock down, (b)start of lock down to a week after lock down and (c) a week after lock down until the end of the lock down.

For this reason we used the Pandas package in Python 3 to do a offline change point analysis of the time series data to identify four change-points. Change points in a time series are the points at which the time series shows abrupt changes and transition between different states of a time series. Change point detection is a very helpful tool while making predictions [3] . These four change-points were studied with reference to the pre-and post-lock down periods mentioned above paragraph. Along with this, 3-point moving averages were plotted in order to find the peak in the daily number of cases. The purpose for selecting a 3-point moving averages scheme is to smooth the time series data while preserving the trend, reduce the impact of outliers and conserve some of the variation in the data. Compared to a 4-point which is far better at making the data smooth, it reduces the number of time series data points and also the averages are plotted at fictitious mid points. These peaks for each of the states were plotted and a cut-off based on the average incubation period (7-14 days) was used to determine whether the lock down has helped in flattening the curve.",

Based on the ACF plot the range of p, say p r was decided such that the correlation coefficient k th lag is above 0.4 and similarly the range of q, sayq r , was decided using the PACF plot. Then for each p,d and q value in the range (0, p r ), (0, q r ) and d = 0, 1, 2, the AIC value of the ARIMA model was computed and the tuple (p, d, q) with the least AIC value were selected.

When we observe the dates at which the states have had their peak number of cases, some states like Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have a peak within one week after implementation of the lock down whereas states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi attain their peak number of cases at around the end of the lock down period which suggests that these states are yet to attain their peak number of cases. This disparity among the states suggests that the implementation of the lock down may have been different in each state and can be attributed to other factors like a difference in policies and need further investigation. For example, Maharashtra has the highest number of cases in the entire country which could be possibly attributed to the high air traffic, population density and the higher testing rate [26] and hence with an increase in testing rate more number of cases are reported as compared to other states. Kerala on the other hand attains a peak on the 25 th of March, 2020, showing that the reduction of daily number of cases in Kerala cannot be attributed to the 21-day national lockdown. The Kerala state government adopted several stringent measure including a state lock down on the 23 rd of March, 2020 [11] , contact tracing and compulsory quarantine for all foreign travellers returning to the country [22] ; these early measures seem to have worked out for Kerala in flattening the curve.",

            "text": "Looking simply at the smoothened data does not give the entire picture. Even though the absolute numbers may increase for some states, it is not an indication that the lockdown is not working. So we parallelly consider the percent changes in the time series data of the daily confirmed cases. We see that in the case of Kerala, the percentage change in the number of daily cases drops drastically around the 25 th day and then remain to be less than 2.5%. The percentage changes oscillate near 0 while constantly loosing amplitude, i.e. the magnitude of the percentage change, and then we see an abrupt rise. This steep increase in the percentage change towards the end of the lock down period can be attributed to the small number of daily confirmed cases which make a small change in absolute numbers to become relatively large. This success of the state of Kerala in reducing the absolute numbers as well as the relative changes can be attributed to their early interventions and prior experience on handling an epidemic [28] . In the case of Maharashtra, we observe that despite the absolute number of cases are increasing the percentage change in the daily confirmed cases reduce in magnitude approximately one week after the lock down peaking at the 14 th day, then start oscillating around 0 towards the end of the lock down period. This suggests that the lock down has been successful in reducing the rate of growth of the pandemic in Maharashtra. A similar trend as Maharashtra is observed in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Punjab, Delhi and Tamil Nadu show a uniform trend in the percent changes of daily cases showing oscillating changes which have similar amplitudes which means that despite the lock down the number of confirmed cases are likely to grow in the coming days. In West Bengal we see that there is a spike a few days after the lockdown and percentage changes become small and closer to zeros near the end of the lock down period. There are huge gaps in the plot as the state has recorded 0 cases on some of the days which could be attributed to having the lowest testing rate in the country. Telangana shows two spikes, one near the beginning and one at the end, with small changes oscillating near zero in between which along with the time series plot shows that the daily confirmed cases spike towards the end of the data meaning that the lockdown has not had an impact in Telangana. In Jammu and Kashmir we see a steady increase in percentage changes and then a decrease. This shows that towards the end of the lockdown period Jammu and kashmir was able to reduce the percentage change in daily confirmed cases.",

            "text": "As we can see from the figures, tables and graphs each state is performing differently, this may be due to the way that the lock downs have been implemented in each of the states. While Maharashtra government declared a lock down on the 23 rd of March and took early measures to reduce physical contact, like stopping the local trains and auto-rickshaws or reducing working staff in government by half or shutting down schools and colleges. Delhi, the state with second highest confirmed cases, despite early measures take by the state government Delhi saw several incidences where the lock down measures and protocol was not followed properly, like the one at the Nizamuddin Markeez which was attended by 3500 people [30] or infection of a doctor in a Mohalla clinic which led to the quarantine of over 800 people [20] . Delhi also saw a huge number of migrant labourers fleeing from the capital due to a fear of lack of food during the 21-day lock down. West Bengal on the other hand has been conducting very few tests [21] and even though they have take many health and administrative measures to tackle the pandemic, one cannot comment on the success or failure of West Bengal state government in curbing the virus due to its low testing rate. Rajasthan's major industry is the tourism with around 24,93,431 foreign tourists recorded in 2018-19 [29] , this high number of oversees tourist renders the state vulnerable to the pandemic. Bhilwara, in Rajasthan, emerged as a hotspot with 27 confirmed cases and and 2 deaths as of 3 rd April and a lock down was imposed as soon as the first case was detected. The district collector rolled out a very aggressive plan for containment including isolation of the district, with its borders sealed, screening in the city and isolation of patients. A containment zone of 2kms was mapped around the residence of any infected individual and all those with foreign travel history were isolated and checked [24] [19] . Gupta, Pal, and Pandey et al. used data from the early-stages of the epidemic and an exponential model to predict that by the end of April, 2020 the number of cases in India would be 75,000 [7] . Using ARIMA models we were able to forecast the daily cases for each state and hence find the cumulative cases and their 95% prediction intervals. These estimates based on ARIMA model for each state provide a much better approximation for the total number of cases. On the 27 th of March, India had 27,982 confirmed cases [12] and the model predicts 27,528 cases and the doubling rate by the 7 th of may would be around 7 days.",
