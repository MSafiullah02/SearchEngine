However, this hormone is more than a simple marker of stress levels-it is necessary for the correct functioning of almost every part of the body. Excesses or deficiencies of this crucial hormone also lead to various physical symptoms and disease states [1] . Although cortisol is not essential for life per se, it helps an organism to cope more efficiently with its environment with particular metabolic actions on glucose production and protein and fat catabolism. Nevertheless, loss or profound diminishment of cortisol secretion leads to a state of abnormal metabolism and an inability to deal with stressors, which, if untreated, may be fatal [1, 2] .",

Cortisol levels in normal individuals are highest in the early morning at around 8 a.m. and are lowest just after midnight. This early morning dip in cortisol level often corresponds to increased symptoms of inflammatory diseases or other pathologies in man [3] . Overlaid upon this diurnal variation is the pulsatile nature of cortisol release under the control of local and central 'clocks' [4] . By mimicking this pulsatile cortisol release, it is hoped to reduce the detrimental side effects of exogenous corticosteroids whilst enhancing their anti-inflammatory properties [4, 5] .",

This is particularly evident when they are administered at pharmacological doses but is also important in controlling normal immune responses. As a consequence, corticosteroids are widely used as drugs to treat many different inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic diseases [e.g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)], inflammatory diseases of the upper airways (rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis), pulmonary inflammatory diseases [bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases (such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonias, idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias, idiopathic fibrosing interstitial pneumonias)], inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), infections (including tuberculosis), inflammatory skin diseases (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) and kidney diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis). Corticosteroids may also be used in organ transplantation to reduce the chance of rejection (see Chap. 32). Thus, although the early effect of cortisol is to stimulate the immune system, cortisol and synthetic corticosteroids predominantly repress the inflammatory response by decreasing the activity and production of immunomodulatory and inflammatory cells.",

            "text": "The usefulness of corticosteroids in treating inflammatory diseases was exemplified by the early work of Kendall and Hench [6] . In a classic experiment, 100 mg of cortisone was injected into the muscle of a patient (Mrs. G.) suffering The secretion of cortisol by the adrenal cortex is under the control of many feedback loops. In response to many external and internal stimuli (such as circadian rhythm and stress responses), neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus release the corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) that travels to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates the corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that by binding to cell surface ACTH receptors, located primarily on the adrenocortical cells of the adrenal gland, stimulates the production of both glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), which are termed for this reason corticosteroids. Cortisol has many functions in different cells and tissues, including hepatic gluconeogenesis (for this reason the molecules mimicking its effect are also termed glucocorticoids). Cortisol also inhibits the secretion of both CRH and ACTH from chronic rheumatoid arthritis on Sept 21, 1948 . Seven days later the patient was able to walk to the shops for the first time in years. Kendall and Hench were awarded the Nobel prize for this work in 1950, and it represented a new approach to therapy with natural hormones by utilising pharmacological, rather than physiological, doses. There are five main aspects of inflammation: (1) the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, lipid mediators, complement factors, CYTOKINES AND CHEMOKINES, other growth factors and neuropeptides and gaseous mediators; (2) increased blood flow in the inflamed area (erythema) caused by some of these inflammatory mediators; (3) leakage of plasma from the vasculature into the damaged area (oedema) due to increased capillary permeability; (4) cellular infiltration signalled by chemoattractants; and (5) repair processes such as tissue fibrosis. Corticosteroids can modify all of these processes.",

The specific characteristics of the INFLAMMATORY SYSTEM and the inflammatory response in each disease and the site of inflammation differ, but both involve the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and changes in the structural cells of the target organ. All are characterised by an increased expression of many INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, enzymes, receptors and ADHESION MOLECULES. The increased expression of these proteins is the result of enhanced gene transcription since many of the genes are not expressed in normal cells but are induced in a cell-specific manner during the inflammatory process [7] .",

            "text": "Corticosteroids are 21-carbon steroid hormones ( Fig. 32. 2) composed of four rings [8, 9] . The basic structure of the A ring is a 1\u03b1, 2\u03b2-half-chair, whatever the substitutions. Rings B and C are semi-rigid chairs with minimal structural influence by substituent groups. In contrast, the shape of the D-ring depends on the nature and environment of the substituent groups. Modern corticosteroids such as prednisone, prednisolone, fluticasone, budesonide, dexamethasone and deflazacort are based on the cortisol (hydrocortisone) structure with modification to enhance the anti-inflammatory effects such as insertion of a C=C double bond at C1,C2 or by the introduction of 6\u03b1-fluoro, 6\u03b1-methyl and 9\u03b1-fluoro and/or further substitutions with \u03b1-hydroxyl, \u03b1-methyl or \u03b2-methyl at the 16 position, for example, in dexamethasone ( Fig. 32. 2) [8, 9] . Reduced binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor is achieved by insertion of the C=C double bond at C1,C2, and lipophilic substituents such as 21\u03b1-esters attached to the D-ring increase glucocorticoid receptor (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1; NR3C1; GR) binding and enhance topical deposition and hepatic metabolism. These substitutions are seen with budesonide and fluticasone two of the most commonly used inhaled corticosteroids [8, 9] . Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is a prodrug of the active form, beclomethasone (beclomethasone-17-monopropionate, BMP). Ciclesonide is a prodrug that is enzymatically hydrolysed, by esterase enzymes of the airways, to a pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (also termed desciclesonide or RM1). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GR has a pocket on the floor of the binding cleft that lies beneath the C17 residue of the steroid backbone. The degree of occupancy of this pocket affects the affinity, duration of action and side effect profile of ligands, and computational chemistry can design drugs with improved clinical characteristics including those without a steroid backbone to improve safety [10] .",

The latter class is able to modulate the activity of a GR agonist and/or may not classically bind the GR LBD. SEGRMs were expected to present the same or better efficacy compared to classical corticosteroids but cause minimal side effects. SEGRAs and SEGRMs are collectively denominated SEGRAMs (selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators) [11] . Although this transrepression vs transactivation concept has been proved to be too simplistic, the SEGRAMs have been helpful in elucidating various molecular actions of the glucocorticoid receptor [11] . The exact structural and lipophilic requirements to optimise corticosteroid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to separate their anti-inflammatory efficacy from their side effects are still unclear, but corticosteroids with improved clinical characteristics are likely to be synthesised as our knowledge in this area increases.",

In addition, cells with sumoylation-deficient FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) fail to interact with Hsp90 and GR, thus facilitating the recruitment of the closely related protein, FKBP52, which enhances GR transcriptional activity [9, [24] [25] [26] . Finally, nitration of the GR results in an enhancement of GR-mediated transcriptional activity. Nuclear GR can induce or repress gene expression following DNA binding at specific glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) or acting as a monomer interact with DNA-bound proinflammatory factors and thereby enable transcriptional regulator proteins to be positioned such that they repress activated gene expression. Pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as ACTIVATOR PROTEIN-1 (AP-1) and NUCLEAR FACTOR KAPPA B (NF-\u039aB), which are upregulated during inflammation, are the major targets for this tethering process although tethering between GR and p65 (the major subunit of NF-\u03baB), for example, is not essential for repression in airway epithelial cells [9, 20, 27, 28] .",

Combining DNase I accessibility assays with chromatin immunoprecipitation and highthroughput sequencing, the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) was identified as a major partner for productive GR-chromatin interactions. This highlighted the critical role for AP-1 in regulating GR-mediated transcription and recruitment to co-regulatory elements. Indeed, the baseline chromatin accessibility of GR recruitment to GREs is dependent on AP-1 binding.

Importantly, increased NF-\u03baB activation at the nuclear localisation and expression level is associated with severe asthma. This process is driven in part by HISTONE DEACETYLASE (HDAC)2-mediated alterations in GR acetylation status. HDAC2 expression and/or activity linked to enhanced HAT activity is reduced in severe asthma patients, particularly children. Interestingly, GRb has been reported to reduce HDAC2 expression in human BAL macrophages. A lack of HDAC activity may also evoke local changes in histone acetylation at inflammatory gene promoters, thereby modulating gene expression [9, 13, 15, 23, 30, [34] [35] [36] . Alterations in the phosphorylation status of RNA polymerase 2 C-terminal domain (CTD) have also been implicated in the mechanism of dexamethasone-induced suppression of TNF-\u03b1-/ NF-\u03baB-induced CXCL8 activation by preventing phosphorylated CTD from interacting with the basal transcription factor P-TEFb. A reduction in HDAC2 expression results in a failure to remove the CTD phosphorylation tag and stalling of RNA polymerase 2 on the promoters of steroidresponsive genes.",

These receptors have distinctive hormone-binding properties, compared to the well-characterised cytoplasmic receptor, and are probably linked to a number of intracellular signalling pathways, acting through G-protein coupled receptors and a number of kinase pathways [40] . In addition, the classical receptor is associated with a variety of kinases and phosphatases within the inactive GR/hsp90 complex. These enzymes are released upon hormone binding and may also account for the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity seen in some cell types by glucocorticoids [41] . Evidence of immediate responses is also seen clinically since systemic doses of corticosteroid can lead to very rapid clinical improvement and inhibition of allergic/anaphylactic responses [42] .",

In general, corticosteroids substantially reduce mast cell-/ eosinophil-/lymphocyte-driven processes while leaving unaltered, or even augmenting, neutrophil-mediated processes [9, 15, [43] [44] [45] . For example, corticosteroids may enhance neutrophil function as a result of increased leukotriene B4 and superoxide anion production, in addition to inhibiting their apoptosis [44] . GCs modulate inflammatory cell survival, inducing apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes and eosinophils while delaying constitutive neutrophil apoptosis and promoting non-inflammatory phagocytosis of apoptotic cell targets, a process important for the successful resolution of inflammation [45, 46] . Corticosteroids in autoimmune diseases decrease the cell and tissue damage mediated by T cells and autoantibodies and immunocomplexes. Interestingly in allergic diseases, corticosteroids reduce the number of mast cells within the inflamed tissue; however, they do not appear to inhibit mediator release from these cells [9, 15, 43, 44] . Treatment with topical corticosteroids also reduces the number of activated T lymphocytes (CD25+ and HLA-DR+) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood from asthmatic patients [47] .",

In addition to their suppressive effects on inflammatory cells, corticosteroids may also decrease endothelial permeability and inhibit plasma exudation and/or leucocyte transendothelial migration in most tissues [9, 15] . Inflammation drives angiogenesis by direct and indirect mechanisms, promoting endothelial proliferation, migration and vessel Glucocorticoids also have a suppressive effect on structural cells of the tissues and can reduce inflammatory mediator release and adhesion molecule expression on epithelial and endothelial cells, microvascular leakage from blood vessels, angiogenesis and both the numbers of mucus cells and release of mucus from these cells sprouting, but also by mediating extracellular matrix remodelling and release of sequestered growth factors and recruitment of proangiogenic leucocyte subsets. By facilitating greater infiltration of leucocytes and plasma proteins into inflamed tissues, angiogenesis can also propagate chronic inflammation [49] , and high doses of topical systemic corticosteroids may reduce both neo-angiogenesis and the increased blood flow present at sites of inflammation [9, 15] . At sites of acute and/or chronic mucosal inflammation, there is often an increased secretion of the major secretory mucins (MUC5AC and MUC5B). The effect of the glucocorticoids on the expression of these mucins is still quite controversial and may be cell-and tissue-type dependent [50] .",

The development of TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and INTERLEUKIN (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 antagonists has provided evidence that, in many inflammatory bowel, rheumatic and skin diseases, these mediators plays a key driving role in inflammation, despite different clinical relevance of each inflammatory mediator in different tissues and diseases [53, 54] (see Chap. 33). This does not appear to be the case with all inflammatory diseases, however [9, 15, 51, 52] . Interestingly, corticosteroids can also enhance the expression of key anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10 and IL-1ra in some inflammatory diseases but again not all [9, 15] .

Leukotrienes, particularly cysteinyl leukotrienes, are thought to play a key role in some chronic and acute inflammatory diseases but do not appear to be major targets for corticosteroids that are unable to block leukotriene biosynthesis and their release [55] . However, corticosteroids in vitro accelerate LTC 4 catabolism by inducing the activity of a LTC 4 -degrading enzyme, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-related enzyme (\u03b3-GTPRE) [56] . Analysis of serum from patients with increasing severity of asthma identified 15 metabolites that were significantly altered in asthma although some such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, cortisone, cortisol, prolylhydroxyproline, pipecolate and N-palmitoyltaurine correlated significantly with ICS and oral corticosteroid use. In contrast, oleoylethanolamide increased with asthma severity independently of steroid treatment. Overall, the data indicated that asthma was characterised by a systemic metabolic shift according to disease severity and that corticosteroid treatment significantly affects metabolism [57] .",

Sub-bronchodilator low doses of theophylline, at concentrations that do not inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 activity, can enhance HDAC2 activity in vitro, and functionally this enhances glucocorticoid effects. Combined theophylline and ICS treatment improves lung function and sputum neutrophilia in stable COPD patients and lung function in smoking asthmatics [9, 15] . This effect may be via phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)\u03b4-induced hyperphosphorylation of HDAC2 particularly since PI3K\u03b4 is upregulated in peripheral lung tissue of patients with COPD. Use of inhaled PI3K\u03b4-selective inhibitors may even prove more efficacious in improving patient responses to ICS [63] . ",

The reduced GC function in refractory asthma may be multifactorial, and each stage of GR activation, namely, GR expression, ligand binding, nuclear translocation and/or binding to the GRE and other transcription factors, has been proposed as a mechanism [9, 15, 64, 65] . It is possible that redox-sensitive activation of the AP pathway may drive relative steroid refractoriness in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from severe steroid-refractory asthmatics [23] . Indeed, the expression of AP-1 components and its upstream activators is greater in PBMCs and bronchial biopsies from patients with corticosteroid-resistant asthma [35] , and their expression is not altered by high doses of oral glucocorticoids [61] . In immortalised peripheral blood B cells, there is a distinct network connectivity and gene ontology pattern between good and poor corticosteroid responders which is linked to AP-1 components and a differential response to apoptosis [32] .",

This may reflect differences in GR phosphorylation status under the control of the p38 MAPK pathway. Increased p38 MAPK activity is also seen in peripheral blood monocytes, and BAL macrophages from patients with severe asthma and p38 MAPK inhibitors restored GC responsiveness in these cells. Similar results are seen in cells from COPD patients. There is some evidence that this may be linked to changes in HDAC and HAT activities. p38 MAPK may also modulate GR responses by changing GR phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of GR on Ser134 is p38 MAPK-dependent and significantly downregulates dexamethasone-dependent genome-wide transcriptional responses and cell functions. MKP-1/DUSP1 is a GC-inducible gene which dephosphorylates and inactivates p38 MAP kinases, and its expression and induction are impaired in severe asthma [9, 15, 64, 65] .",

Neutrophilic asthma is associated with GC refractoriness and increased IL-17 expression and Th17 cells. An animal model of asthma demonstrated that Th17 cell transfer causes a dexamethasone-insensitive neutrophilic inflammatory response and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine.

IFN\u03b3 may be one of the dominant mediators responsible for chronic persistent airflow obstruction in severe asthma, and primary bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IFN\u03b3 do not respond to GC. These inflammatory responses are, however, completely ablated by treatment of cells with a JAK-STAT inhibitor.

            "text": "The pharmacokinetics of many corticosteroids has been well described. In general, plasma concentrations of corticosteroids vary considerably (up to tenfold) after oral administration of the same dose by normal volunteers and asthmatic patients although the reasons for this are unclear [67] . The pharmacokinetic properties of topical drugs depend upon a combination of tissue deposition/ targeting, receptor binding, volume of distribution, tissue retention and lipid conjugation. In addition, in order to achieve a good therapeutic index, drugs need to possess a low oral bioavailability and small particle size, rapid metabolism, high clearance, high plasma protein binding and a low systemic half-life. Furthermore, an ideal compound would be inactive at sites distal to the target organ/tissues [69, 70] . There are two main methods of reducing the systemic activity of topical corticosteroids: (1) reducing gastrointestinal BIOAVAILABILITY and (2) prolonging TISSUE RESIDENCY. For example, oral administration of ileal release budesonide capsules for the treatment of Crohn's disease gives similar levels of systemic exposure to active drug, bioavailability and cortisol suppression in adults and children as seen with prednisolone, but importantly, no clinically relevant adverse side effects were reported [71] . Alternatively, for IBD the corticosteroid can be altered to reduce gastrointestinal absorption and/ or enhance first-pass hepatic metabolism. Prolonged retention in the tissue can be achieved by increasing lipophilicity, as with fluticasone propionate (FP) and fluticasone furoate (FF) and mometasone furoate, or by forming soluble intracellular fatty acid esters, as with budesonide and ciclesonide [9, 15, 63, 72, 73] .",

            "text": "Asthma has long been known as a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower airways, and the beneficial effect of the potent anti-inflammatory prednisolone in asthmatic patients further emphasised this point. Treatment with prednisolone was associated with adverse side effects however. Dramatic improvements in asthma symptoms were also seen with the introduction of ICS which had few systemic side effects and systemic CORTICOSTEROID-SPARING effects. In these initial studies, only 40% of asthmatics responded well to ICS with respect to improvements in lung function-it was not investigated whether this is related to a lack of PATIENT ADHERENCE, poor inhaler technique or a true relative insensitivity to ICS [9, 15] . The routine use of ICS to prevent airway inflammation in combination with relievers such as \u03b2 2 agonists, which help the airway smooth muscle to relax after contraction, is effective in treating symptoms, reducing exacerbations and improving lung function in most asthmatics and has resulted in great improvements in asthma control and the quality of life of most asthmatics [9, 13, 15, 61, 64] . Unfortunately a minority of asthmatics show refractoriness to GC treatment (see above and Chap. 23). In asthma, corticosteroids consistently lessen airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and the maximal response to a number of spasmogens and irritants. Interestingly, the reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) may not be maximal until treatment has been given for several months. The magnitude of the reduction varies, and airway responsiveness can remain abnormal [9, 13, 15, 42, 61, 64] .",

            "text": "In contrast to asthma, glucocorticoid treatment of stable COPD is rather ineffective in reducing airway inflammation and the decline of lung function. Current national and international guidelines for the management of stable COPD patients recommend the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, ICS and their combination for maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe stable COPD (https://goldcopd.org) [63] . Several large controlled clinical trials of inhaled combination therapy with ICS and LABAs/ULABAs in stable COPD have shown that this combination therapy is well tolerated and produces a modest but statistically significant reduction in the number of severe exacerbations and improvement in FEV 1 , quality of life and respiratory symptoms in stable COPD patients (see also Chap. 23). In addition, the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study showed a 17% relative reduction in mortality over 3 years for patients receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate, although this just failed to reach significance. Some patients with COPD do respond to ICS however. The Groningen and Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease (GLUCOLD) study suggested that particular phenotypes of COPD benefit from fluticasone propionate \u00b1 salmeterol by reducing the rate of lung function decline. In ICS-responsive patients, the expression of genes associated with cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial cell signalling, p53 signalling and T-cell signalling was decreased. Overall, the long-term benefits of ICS on FEV1 decline in moderate-to-severe COPD were most pronounced in patients with fewer pack-years and less severe emphysema and inflammation [76] . Blood eosinophil counts are a promising biomarker of the response to ICS in COPD and could potentially be used to stratify patients for different exacerbation risk and reduction strategies despite we need more long-term controlled clinical trials in this area to better understand the precise cut-off of the blood eosinophil count to use for this purpose in daily clinical practice.

Several studies have demonstrated the symptomatic efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in these diseases and the prevention of nasal polyposis. Oral corticosteroids are usually reserved only to nasal polyps unresponsive to maximal pharmacological treatment with intranasal glucocorticoids associated with oral antileukotrienes [80] . There might be an improvement in symptom severity, polyp size and condition of the sinuses when assessed using CT scans in patients taking oral corticosteroids when these are used as an adjunct therapy to antibiotics or intranasal corticosteroids, but the quality of the evidence supporting this is low or very low. It is also unclear whether the benefits of oral corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy are sustained beyond the short follow-up period reported (up to 30 days), as no longer-term data are available.

Autoimmune liver diseases result from an immune-mediated injury of different tissues, with autoimmune hepatitis targeting hepatocytes and primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis targeting cholangiocyte. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends the use of combination therapy with prednisone (or prednisolone) and azathioprine as first choice treatment. Monotherapy with prednisone is preferred in cases of pregnancy, however. For combination therapy, the induction dose of prednisone is 30 mg daily for 1 week, followed by 20 mg daily for 1 week, followed by 15 mg daily for 2 weeks. The maintenance dose is 10 mg daily until treatment is stopped. For monotherapy, a typical induction dose of prednisone is 60 mg daily for 1 week followed by 40 mg in the second week and 30 mg daily in the third and fourth week. The maintenance dose of prednisone is 20 mg daily until the endpoint or deep clinical remission. Prednisone should be tapered over time and eventually discontinued. AASLD recommends at least 3 years of treatment. Upon completion of prednisone, patients are classified as in remission, relapsed or treatment failure based on their histopathological and laboratory response to corticosteroids and the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. Mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and biological agents are reserved for selected nonresponsive patients and administered only in experienced centres.

Several SEGRAMs have been reported which show dissociated properties in human cells and are now in clinical development, showing good separation between transrepression and transactivation actions in the skin. This suggests that the development of SEGRAMs with a greater margin of safety is possible and may even lead to the development of oral compounds that have reduced adverse effects. Furthermore, the newer inhaled corticosteroids used today, such as fluticasone (both propionate and furoate), mometasone and budesonide, appear to have more potent transrepressing than transactivating effects, which may account, at least in part, for their selection as potent antiinflammatory agents [9, 15] . These new potent corticosteroids are particularly effective as topical agents, and their use has overtaken that of oral/systemic corticosteroids for many diseases. An alternative approach to obtain safer drugs is the use of soft drugs, such as ciclesonide, which are only activated at the site of inflammation. Ciclesonide is a novel inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma. Ciclesonide itself is inactive and needs to be cleaved by lung-specific esterases in order to bind to the GR. According to data from healthy volunteers and asthma patients, ciclesonide affects serum cortisol levels significantly less compared to beclomethasone dipropionate or fluticasone propionate, indicating that ciclesonide might have less systemic effects and hence a superior safety profile [9, 15] .",

            "text": "Corticosteroids are the most effective therapy for chronic immune and inflammatory diseases in current use. Despite their success over the past 70 years, and especially since the advent of new potent halogenated compounds, worries about the detrimental side effects of systemic corticosteroids have limited their long-term use. This has resulted in the increasing use of topical corticosteroids targeted to the site of inflammation rather than systemic administration. Improvements in risk/benefit ratios are likely to occur, as greater understanding of the role of chemical substitution of the synthetic corticosteroids becomes clear and more potent tissue selective drugs are developed. Drugs that target distinct aspects of corticosteroid function, switching on or off genes, are also under development and, along with non-steroidal agents that target different aspects of the inflammatory response, are likely to lead to safer drugs with a much reduced side effect profile. However, until these become widely available, current systemic and topical corticosteroids are likely to remain the major treatment for most acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.",
