            "text": "First discovered in 1994 associated with tumor lesions in AIDS patients in Los Angeles (Chang et al., 1994), Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has since been shown to cause endemic cancers in sub-Saharan Africa, the greater Mediterranean, and the Xinjiang region of China (Ganem, 2010, Giffin and Damania, 2014). KSHV is a member of the herpesvirus subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, which also includes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the first identified human oncovirus. Like all herpesviruses, assembly of an infectious KSHV virion starts at a bacteriophage-like portal complex that putatively nucleates the formation of a T = 16 icosahedral capsid, which, at maturation, is composed of major capsid protein (MCP), small capsid protein (SCP), \u03b1\u03b22 heterotrimers of the Tri1 monomer and Tri2 dimer and is decorated by capsid-associated tegument complexes (CATCs) (Cardone et al., 2012). Upon establishment of an initial procapsid, the portal facilitates the translocation of KSHV\u2019s \u223c150-kb genome. This key process involves recruitment of an ATP-driven terminase (Yang et al., 2007, Heming et al., 2017) to the unique portal vertex to recognize, package, and cleave concatemeric viral double-stranded (ds)DNA, which, in conjunction with CATC\u2019s critical supporting roles (Heming et al., 2017), give rise to viable genome-containing nucleocapsids (Adelman et al., 2001, Beard et al., 2002). Unlike the comparatively high occupancies of capsid-associated tegument proteins in alphaherpesviruses (Dai and Zhou, 2018, Wang et al., 2018) and betaherpesviruses (Liu et al., 2018, Yu et al., 2017), KSHV CATC binding sites are markedly partially and/or more flexibly occupied, leading to poorly resolved CATC structures in prior icosahedral reconstructions of KSHV (Dai et al., 2014, Dai et al., 2018). The CATC nonetheless plays a critical role in the release of a pleomorphic virion because the recruitment of outer tegument proteins and a glycoprotein-sporting envelope leading to virion egress depend on interactions of various viral proteins with constituents of the CATC (Owen et al., 2015, Sathish et al., 2012).",

An invaluable body of pioneering work has been accomplished so far on the prototypical herpesvirus herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) portal, including microscopy studies confirming its localization at a capsid vertex (Cardone et al., 2007), its dodecameric stoichiometry (Rochat et al., 2011), and, more recently, the impressive identification and reconstruction of the 5-fold vertex region surrounding the portal (McElwee et al., 2018). Here we present the first atomic structures of a gammaherpesvirus portal vertex in KSHV, which allowed us to use structure-guided mutageneses to identify a viable drug target. Simultaneously, our method of symmetry relaxation and sequential localized classification enabled us to dissect a heretofore puzzling schema of variable CATC occupancy at capsid vertices, providing insights into portal-seeded capsid assembly and how structural plasticity arises from a well-defined and highly ordered capsid.",

            "text": "To determine high-resolution structures of KSHV\u2019s unique portal vertex, we imaged frozen-hydrated KSHV virions, obtaining 44,328 virion particle images. Prior KSHV capsid reconstructions, although informative, have been calculated with icosahedral symmetry applied, obscuring non-icosahedrally related structures (Dai et al., 2018, Trus et al., 2001, Wu et al., 2000). Here we developed a workflow (Figures S1\nand S2\n) to determine structures of the non-icosahedrally arranged components. This sub-particle data processing procedure, employing sequential localized classification with symmetry relaxation, allows stepwise reconstruction of selected regions of a viral particle. Briefly, two rounds of sub-particle classification were performed to relax icosahedral and local symmetries. In the first round, 12 \u201csub-particles\u201d of capsid vertices were extracted from each virion image using coordinates calculated from an initial icosahedral reconstruction of the virion particle. We then performed 3D classification with 5-fold symmetry applied to sort out the unique portal vertex sub-particle from the 11 penton vertex sub-particles for each virion image. Subsequent refinement yielded a 4.3-\u00c5 resolution reconstruction of the portal vertex with 5-fold (C5) symmetry (first visualized in HSV-1; McElwee et al., 2018), revealing high-resolution structures of the capsid components surrounding the portal (Table 1\n; Figures S1, S2A, and S2D). A second round of sub-particle classification further relaxed C5 symmetry at the portal vertex, and subsequent refinement with C12 symmetry resulted in a 4.7-\u00c5 reconstruction, revealing high-resolution features of the dodecameric portal (Table 1; Figures S1, S2A, and S2E). Using a specific orientation determined in our C12 classification, we then calculated an asymmetric (C1) reconstruction of the entire dsDNA-containing capsid at 7.6 \u00c5 (Table 1; Figures 1\nA, S1, S2B, and S2G; Video S1) and a C1 reconstruction of the portal vertex at 5.2 \u00c5 (Table 1; Figures 1B, S1, S2A, and S2F). Our C1 structures reveal concentrically packed layers of DNA with an inter-duplex distance of \u223c25 \u00c5, quasi-5-fold-organized capsid and tegument densities, a quasi-12-fold-symmetric portal dodecamer, and asymmetric terminal DNA within a DNA translocation channel capped by a distinctive density visible at lower thresholds (Figures 1A and 1B). This stepped implementation of symmetry expansion and sub-particle classification thus proved effective in teasing apart the multiple symmetry mismatches present in herpesvirus capsids.",

Despite a lack of sequence homology, our pORF43 model showed striking similarities with structures of phage portal proteins in domain organization and topology (Lebedev et al., 2007, Lokareddy et al., 2017, Sun et al., 2015). We thus named the five domains of our pORF43 model in a fashion analogous to phage portal proteins: wing (aa 9\u201345 and 126\u2013245), wall (aa 46\u2013125 and 496\u2013553), stem (aa 246\u2013272 and 454\u2013477), clip (aa 273\u2013453 [aa 281\u2013412 unmodeled]), and \u03b2-hairpin (aa 478\u2013495) (Figure 1D). The N-terminal eight residues (aa 1\u20138) and C-terminal 52 residues (aa 554\u2013605) were disordered and also not modeled. Also similar to phages, 12 copies of pORF43 arrange in a vaguely flying saucer-like ring (Lebedev et al., 2007, Lokareddy et al., 2017, Sun et al., 2015). In agreement with previous tomographic (Cardone et al., 2007, Chang et al., 2007) and intermediate-resolution (McElwee et al., 2018, Rochat et al., 2011) visualizations of herpesvirus portals, we observe pORF43 portal docking in the capsid through interactions between the portal\u2019s wing domains and the surrounding MCP floor and, additionally, between the base of the portal clip and the Tri1 subunit of periportal triplexes (Figure 1B). Clip, stem, \u03b2-hairpin, and wall domains largely form the interior of the portal channel (i.e., DNA translocation channel) through which DNA is threaded into the capsid during genome packaging (Figures 1D and 1E).",

Notably, both regions contain characteristic \u03b2 sheets and interact with DNA in our mature virion state. Arranged radially, 12 \u03b2-hairpins comprise an apertured disk perpendicular to the portal channel axis (Figure 1E). Interestingly, residues that line the channel are markedly positively charged above this aperture, likely facilitating interactions with negatively charged DNA (Figure 1F). Twelve sets of three-stranded \u03b2 sheets roughly parallel to the channel axis form the base of the clip region (Figure 1G). Each \u03b2 sheet is the result of a 2+1 augmentation motif, where two parallel clip \u03b2 strands from each pORF43 subunit are augmented in anti-parallel fashion by a single clip \u03b2 strand from its clockwise neighbor (when viewing toward the capsid interior) (Figure 1G, insets); this results in a \u201cdaisy-chained\u201d ring structure, conceivably ideal for propagating and coordinating conformation changes among subunits in the dodecameric complex during dsDNA translocation.",

During DNA packaging, the distal end of this turret is the putative docking site of terminase (Yang et al., 2007, Heming et al., 2017). The lower resolution of the clip turret is thus likely a result of inherent plasticity in the structure to accommodate interactions with various partners during different stages of viral assembly (e.g., terminase during active DNA packaging and the portal cap after packaging).",

However, peripenton CATC densities in the KSHV icosahedral reconstruction were distinctively weaker than surrounding capsid proteins and only discernible when low-pass-filtered to \u223c6-\u00c5, suggesting low CATC occupancy and/or flexibility (Dai et al., 2014); in contrast, the HSV-1 icosahedral reconstruction indicated full CATC occupancy (Dai and Zhou, 2018). Interestingly, our C1 reconstruction of the KSHV portal vertex reveals the presence of five CATC densities with a strength comparable with that of underlying capsid elements, indicating full occupancy of the five CATC registers surrounding the portal vertex. This preferred association of CATC with the portal vertex over the remaining 11 (penton) vertices suggests an important role of CATC at the portal vertex, to be discussed later.",

When displayed at a density threshold appropriate for capsid proteins, our C1 capsid reconstruction shows two adjacent (i.e., ortho) CATCs bound to each portal-proximal penton vertex, one CATC to each portal-distal penton vertex, and no visible CATCs at the portal-opposite penton vertex (Figure 2\nA). Incrementally decreasing the density display threshold reveals additional CATCs of progressively weaker density (indicating progressively lower occupancies at those registers) manifesting at penton vertices in a \u201cportal-outward\u201d manner (Figures 2B and S4\n). Importantly, within each penton vertex, CATCs appear to selectively bind registers on the portal side of a hypothetical \u201cequatorial\u201d bisecting the penton vertex, with a clear preference for the most portal-side register (Figure S4). Adherence to this \u201cportal-side equatorial rule\u201d is exemplified by the observation that portal-proximal penton vertices (with two registers portal-side of the equatorial) max out at two CATC copies as the density display threshold is decreased, whereas portal-distal penton vertices (with three portal-side registers) max out at three CATC copies. Portal-opposite vertices can bind the CATC at any register (i.e., no preferred register), up to five CATCs in total, because every register is portal-side (Figures 2B and S4).",

Thus, to accurately assess the specific occupancy of penton vertex CATCs and to understand the structural basis of a CATC\u2019s discriminatory association with portal and penton vertices, we relaxed 5-fold symmetry for penton vertex sub-particles and performed 3D focused classification of their CATC-binding registers (Figure S1). Using a mask encompassing the region surrounding one CATC, four resulting classes were obtained. Although three classes clearly lacked CATC densities, one class contained a CATC density of a quality comparable with surrounding capsid protein densities (Figure S1). 37.9% of masked sub-particles (i.e., 37.9% of penton vertex registers) were assigned to this CATC-binding class, slightly higher than the \u223c30% occupancy estimated in our previous KSHV icosahedral study (Dai et al., 2014).",

In all, eight possible permutations of zero to five CATCs can bind a penton vertex, all of which were observed and reconstructed in our analyses (Figure 3\nA). In agreement with trends observed in our C1 capsid reconstruction, penton vertices with two adjacent CATCs bound were most abundant (ortho-CATC-binding, at 38.6% of penton vertex sub-particles), followed by penton vertices with a single CATC bound (one-CATC-binding, at 21.9% of sub-particles). Five-CATC-binding penton vertices were rarest, as expected, at 0.2% of sub-particles because, barring deviations to the C1 capsid-observed consensus binding pattern, these should be limited to the portal-opposite vertices of highly bound capsids. Finally, we tallied the total number of penton CATCs in each capsid from our classified penton vertex sub-particles. The resulting histogram follows a sharp, slightly left-skewed Gaussian distribution peaking at approximately 23 penton CATCs per capsid (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, additional CATC binding falls off sharply after capsids have bound 30 penton CATCs, which happens to be the theoretical maximum of a capsid with \u201cfull\u201d penton vertex CATC binding in compliance with the portal-side equatorial rule. In all, these results\u2014the full occupancy of portal CATC registers, the portal vertex-referenced directional binding of CATC within penton vertices, and the portal-dictated maximum of allowed binding registers\u2014strongly suggest that the nucleating portal effects long-range (allosteric) structural influence on the penton vertices of each capsid.",

Obvious differences aside\u2014e.g., a portal in the portal vertex, an SCP-decorated penton in the penton vertex, or CATC occupancies\u2014the two vertices also differ in the presence of a disk-like portal cap at the distal ends of the portal vertex\u2019s CATC helix bundles (Figure 4C, magenta) versus a globular density cocked to the right of the penton vertex\u2019s CATC helix bundle (Figure 4D, magenta). Because this globular density\u2019s size and proximity to CATC (Figure 4E) are reminiscent of the flexibly tethered head domain of pUL25 in HSV-1 (a homolog of KSHV pORF19), we interpret this density as the head domain of one of the pORF19 copies in the CATC. Indeed, the crystal structure of an HSV-1 pUL25 head domain (PDB: 2F5U) (Bowman et al., 2006) satisfactorily fits into the globular density (Figure 4F), lending support to its assignment as pORF19. We then proceeded to construct a homology model of the pORF19 head domain (aa 127\u2013546) using PDB: 2F5U as a template (Figures 4E and 4F). From the homology model, we estimate that aa 457\u2013468 map to a finger-like density that inserts between an adjacent penton MCP and SCP, serving as the sole interacting residues between CATC and the penton protrusion (Figure 4E).",

Nonetheless, several lines of evidence support interpretation of the portal cap as pORF19. First, CATC helix bundles clearly connect with the portal cap at lower resolutions/density thresholds (Figure 4C, black circles). Second, the portal cap density is about the size of five pORF19 head domains and further exhibits five weaker globular densities attached at its periphery (Figure 4C, green circle), analogous to the globular density assigned to the second pORF19 head domain at the penton vertex (Figures 4D, green circle, S5B, and S5C). Third, functional data indicate that HSV-1 pUL25 (pORF19\u2019s homolog), but not HSV-1 pUL36 (pORF64\u2019s homolog), is critical for viral genome encapsidation, especially near the termination of genome packaging (McNab et al., 1998, Ogasawara et al., 2001). Moreover, pUL25 plays an important role in docking the incoming capsid at host cell nuclear pores and gating the release of the viral genome (Huffman et al., 2017, Pasdeloup et al., 2009). It is therefore plausible that pORF19 could be intimately associated with the portal channel, and the portal cap is certainly poised in a prime position to execute pORF19\u2019s roles in regulating the retention and release of the viral genome.",

In both viruses, the pORF32-equivalent CATC subunit (pUL17 in HSV-1) functions as a structural framework facilitating capsid association of the other four subunits that make up the CATC helix bundle. Side-by-side comparison of pORF32 and pUL17 models reveals similar core structures of separate N- and C-terminal \u03b2 sheet-rich domains positioned beneath a central \u03b1 helix\u2013rich arch (Figures 4G and 4H, orange). However, several prominent features visible in pUL17 are missing in pORF32, accounting for pORF32\u2019s 249 fewer residues: a \u201chump,\u201d characterized by four short helices at the top of the arch that constrain and orient CATC\u2019s helix bundle in HSV-1; an extended helix; and a short helix bundle at the vertex-proximal end of pUL17 (Dai and Zhou, 2018). Notably, pUL17\u2019s short helix bundle makes direct contact with the underlying triplex Ta, almost solely mediating CATC-Ta binding in HSV-1. In pORF32, nearly the entirety of this region is disordered and/or invisible in both portal and penton vertex reconstructions save for a 13-aa \u201canchoring loop\u201d (AL; aa 220\u2013232) (Figure 4G, yellow). Although pORF32\u2019s 93 unmodeled residues in this region may potentially account for the critical Ta-interacting helix bundle, a structure-based sequence alignment of pORF32 with pUL17 suggests that the Ta-binding short helix bundle in pUL17 is missing, even in the pORF32 sequence (Figure S3B).",

A comparison of our models of KSHV triplexes with and without the CATC (Table 1; Figures 4I and 4J) reveals that all Ta triplexes underlying CATCs experience an \u223c120\u00b0 counterclockwise axial rotation relative to canonical undecorated triplex Ta (cf. Figures 4I and 4J). Our models suggest that this rotation may be due to the steric specificity of pORF32\u2019s Ta-binding AL. Specifically, a 120\u00b0 counterclockwise rotation of Ta exposes a deep groove running between the molecular boundaries of Tri1 and the Tri2A/B dimer that facilitates docking of pORF32\u2019s AL and, thus, CATC. Strikingly, despite CATC-decorated Ta\u2019s large degree of apical (i.e., main body) rotation, our structures show that Tri1\u2019s N-anchor\u2014the characteristic N terminus of Tri1 subunits that penetrates the capsid floor\u2014maintains a conserved orientation in the capsid interior at penton vertices regardless of Ta\u2019s apical orientation (and, by extension, regardless of CATC decoration) (Figures 4I and 4J, respective insets). (Periportal Ta triplexes, which are all CATC-decorated, exhibit 120\u00b0 counterclockwise apical rotation, but their Tri1 N-anchors are disordered and appear to adopt a unique configuration.)",

First, the presence of a uniform Tri1 N-anchor orientation (barring periportal triplexes) supports the notion that initial triplex attachment to the procapsid, putatively through the Tri1 N-anchor, precedes the stage of CATC binding (reviewed in Heming et al., 2017). Second, whatever the means by which the portal effects triplex orientation and, thus, CATC binding (or perhaps vice versa) presumably occurs at a stage of procapsid maturation before triplexes are fully \u201cstapled\u201d to the MCP floor by main-body interactions (Zhou et al., 2014). This is predicated upon the necessity for triplex Ta to have sufficient rotational freedom to permit adoption of a CATC-bound orientation. Third, for reasons one and two, CATC binding occupancy is highly unlikely to be predetermined but, rather, determined with the simultaneous maturation of the procapsid, although this is subject to influence by the portal, as demonstrated previously.",

Contact with Tc occurs mainly via a short helical motif (aa 20\u201324) from the N-terminal tail of the \u201cupper\u201d (magenta) pORF19 subunit. An adjacent helix belonging to Tc Tri1 (aa 264\u2013275) orthogonal to the pORF19 helical motif fits within the motif\u2019s helical groove (Figure 5F), with Tri1\u2019s Thr269 and Arg268 and pORF19\u2019s Arg22 contributing hydrogen bonds to this intermolecular interaction (Figure 5G).

Particularly, strong unassigned densities roughly three aa in length occupy the Tri1-Tri2A/B surface groove of Tc (Figure 5I), analogous to pORF32\u2019s AL occupying triplex Ta\u2019s groove (Figures 5B\u20135D). Given that the N-terminal tail of upper pORF19 appears to extend away from Tc, and given the proximity of lower pORF19\u2019s Nth-most residue to Tc\u2019s groove, the unassigned densities likely belong to the unmodeled N-terminal residues of lower pORF19. If interactions here are also similar to AL binding at Ta (i.e., in part involving \u03b2 sheet-like hydrogen bonds between adjacent backbones), then pORF19 binding at this site may not necessarily be sequence-specific, thus accounting for the unresolved side-chain densities because of averaging.",

We posited that these \u201closs-of-Ta-interaction\u201d pORF32 mutants might serve as dominant negatives if NH and/or AL are critical for CATC-Ta binding. Essentially, pORF32 mutants expressed in KSHV-replicating cells should compete against wild-type (WT) pORF32 (32WT) for incorporation into CATC so that mutant-incorporated CATC would be deficient in capsid association, inhibiting KSHV virion formation. Indeed, expression of 32\u0394NH and 32\u0394AL reduced virion production to 30.7% and 27.8% of that of the control, respectively, whereas expression of 32\u0394NH-\u0394AL inhibited levels to 12.1% (Figures 5J and 5K). Importantly, viral DNA replication and viral RNA transcription were not significantly affected (Figures S6\nA and S6C). These results confirm that the pORF32 NH and AL are both important for KSHV virion production, supporting our interpretation that these aa stretches mediate CATC-Ta binding.",

Compared with WT pORF19 (19WT), 19\u0394N28 expression reduced virion production to 9.7% of that of the control without significantly affecting viral DNA replication or RNA transcription (Figures 5L, 5M, S6B, and S6D), indicating that pORF19 N-terminal interactions with Tc (Figures 5F\u20135I) are important for viral efficacy. Remarkably, expression of 19\u0394N17 also inhibited virion production to 30.6% of that of the control (Figures 5L, 5M, S6B, and S6D), suggesting that pORF19\u2019s first 17 residues of pORF19 are required for optimal pORF19-Tc binding. These findings are therefore consistent with our speculation that lower pORF19\u2019s unmodeled N-terminal residues (aa 1\u201321) bind Tc\u2019s hydrophobic groove, enhancing CATC-Tc binding.",

Currently, most available drugs countering herpesvirus infections are nucleic acid analogs that target viral DNA synthesis. Unfortunately, these often elicit negative side effects, including frequent induction of drug-resistant mutant viruses and varying kinds of toxicity (Gilbert et al., 2002, Reusser, 1996, Walling et al., 2003).

A metastable spherical procapsid then forms as follows. Tethering by the scaffolding protein brings together additional MCP molecules. The scaffolding core ensures proper curvature and size of the capsid in what is known as the \u201crope\u201d mechanism (Deng et al., 2008), and heterotrimeric triplexes, with the N-terminal anchor of Tri1 (pORF62) traversing the capsid shell, \u201cplug\u201d every 3-fold hole between MCP capsomers. Our data showing that CATC-triplex Ta association correlates with a 120\u00b0 apical rotation of Ta (Figure 4I and 4J)\u2014but not the 3-fold-related 240\u00b0, eliminating the possibility of this being a stochastic event\u2014indicate that the determination of CATC binding (and, likely, binding of CATC itself or at least a subunit of CATC; Thurlow et al., 2006) occurs not long after procapsid formation, when the triplex\u2019s apical orientation has yet to be fixed by procapsid maturation. Procapsid maturation is concomitant with DNA packaging; head-full is likely sensed through capsid elements and relayed by the portal through the turret-like structure to the externally located terminase for cleavage of the concatemeric genome (Yang et al., 2007), and the spring-loaded dsDNA genome is corked inside the capsid by the portal cap, putatively formed by five portal-adjacent CATCs (Figure 1B).",

Accordingly, all three sub-families of herpesviruses have highly conserved capsid proteins and structures but only partially conserved tegument and envelope proteins because these more often reflect specific host cell adaptations. Among tegument proteins, CATC is unique in possessing a structural role and, thus, being relatively conserved, but even so, a surprising finding here is that, unlike the full occupancy of CATC at capsid vertices in neurotropic HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Dai et al., 2014, Dai and Zhou, 2018, Wang et al., 2018), CATC occupancy in KSHV at penton vertices is only partial and varies even among KSHV capsids (Figures 2 and 3). That KSHV CATC occupancy appears to be dictated at least in part by the portal not only underscores the portal\u2019s aforementioned nucleation role but further spotlights its allosteric effect in defining an emergent first level of variability that, importantly, demarcates a departure from symmetry in KSHV metastructure. A second constructive level of variability is facilitated by pORF64, which accounts for two of the five subunits in CATC and is the largest tegument protein, with 2,635 residues folded into multiple domains joined by presumably flexible linkers (the vast majority of pORF64 is thus invisible in our structure). Some of these domains recruit other tegument proteins and bind the endodomains of envelope glycoproteins (Rozen et al., 2008, Sathish et al., 2012), introducing pleomorphic variability. Last, the majority of tegument proteins, including pORF64, have been shown to be capable of being packaged into non-infectious virus-like vesicles in the absence of capsids (Gong et al., 2017), suggesting an alternate pathway of tegument incorporation into virions independent of the capsid/CATC, implicating yet another level of assembly-driven variability.",

In much the same way that more genetically fluid RNA viruses such as influenza viruses (Harris et al., 2006, Vahey and Fletcher, 2019), filoviruses (Bharat et al., 2011), and coronaviruses (Goldsmith et al., 2004) benefit from heterogeneous compositions to rapidly respond to selective pressures, structural pleomorphism may provide a crucial avenue of diversity in more genetically constrained dsDNA viruses (because of lower mutation rates) like KSHV, resulting in an increase in evolutionary bandwidth. In essence, facing a relative lack of intraspecies genetic diversity (the tradeoff is more viable progeny), adaptability regarding the ability to manipulate hosts is, instead, implemented at a structural level. Our findings regarding KSHV CATC occupancy offer a pertinent example: given that HSV pUL36 (KSHV pORF64\u2019s homolog) is involved in axonic transport of alphaherpesvirus capsids (Dai and Zhou, 2018, Luxton et al., 2005), the absence of full CATC occupancy in non-neurotropic KSHV perhaps reflects its lack of need for long-range neuronal transport. The emergent transition from rigidly symmetric structures to less-structured compartments described here thus sheds light on a delicate balance of conservation and adaptation that delineates the genetic arms race between herpesvirus and host.",

Each orientation has three Euler angles denoted as parameters within the Relion star files: rot (_rlnAngleRot), tilt (_rlnAngleTilt), and psi (_rlnAnglePsi). We then defined the orientation for each of the twelve vertices from the 60 icosahedrally-related orientations as follows. First, we noted that because our icosahedral reconstruction was performed using I3 symmetry, there are 5 redundant orientations relative to each vertex that differ only in their rot angles (i.e., the in-plane rotation angle about the z axis). For this reason, we classified the 60 orientations into twelve groups each, with five orientations per group that differ only in their rot angles. We then randomly chose one of the five orientations in each group as the orientation of that vertex, thereby defining the orientations for all twelve vertices of each capsid.",

No rotational orientation search was allowed during classification (using the \u2013skip_rotate parameter in Relion), though the center for each vertex sub-particle was refined with a \u00b1 3 pixel offset search. The initial reference for classification was a 30-\u00c5 reconstruction of the vertex sub-particles using relion_reconstruct. Although the portal vertex lacks true 5-fold symmetry, this classification with 5-fold symmetry imposed successfully distinguished between penton and portal vertices. Through 50 iterations of 3D classification, four classes were ultimately generated, with one class in particular exhibiting markedly different structures (i.e., a blurry central channel with a rod-like density) (Figure S1). Additionally, this class contained 7.9%, or approximately 1/12th of the vertex sub-particles, consistent with the expectation that one out of twelve capsid vertices in each particle is a portal vertex. We thus considered this class the portal vertex class. In rare instances, two or more vertices from a capsid were classified into the portal vertex class, likely due to the low quality of these individual particles and/or errors in classification. These redundant sub-particles were removed as follows: if two or more vertices from the same virus particle were assigned to the portal vertex class, only the vertex sub-particle with the highest _rlnMaxValueProbDistribution score was retained. Upon removing all redundant particles, 39,773 vertex sub-particles remained and were deemed sub-particles of the portal vertex, henceforth referred to as \u201cportal vertex sub-particles.\u201d 3D auto-refinement with 5-fold symmetry imposed was then performed on these portal vertex sub-particles with only a local search for orientation determination. Using relion_postprocess, the final resolution of this C5 reconstruction was calculated with two independently refined maps from halves of the dataset with gold-standard FSC at the 0.143 criterion (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003), and determined to be 4.3-\u00c5 (Figures S2A and S2D).

We then applied 3D classification with 12-fold symmetry imposed and without rotational orientation search, which, after 100 iterations, yielded five classes of similar structures with a rotational difference of approximately 72\u00b0 between classes. Ideally, each of the five expanded orientations of a dodecamer sub-particle should be assigned to exactly one of the five classes, such that each class should contain 20% of the symmetry-expanded sub-particles. After removing redundant particles as previously described\u2014only particles with the highest _rlnMaxValueProbDistribution score was retained\u2014the five classes contained 39,073, 37,753, 36,797, 37,270, 38,031 particles, respectively. As the five reconstructed classes were of the same quality upon visual inspection, we chose the class with the most abundant particles for 3D refinement with 12-fold symmetry imposed and limited to local orientation search. As with the previous reconstruction, the resolution of this C12 portal dodecamer reconstruction was calculated with relion_postprocess using gold-standard FSC at the 0.143 criterion (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003), and determined to be \u223c4.7-\u00c5. However, both a visual assessment of the portal\u2019s density and local resolution estimate derived from ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014) indicate the majority of the portal itself has a resolution of \u223c4.0-\u00c5 (Figures S2A and S2E), thereby permitting ab initio modeling. The lower resolution estimate obtained from FSC calculation likely results from the unresolved, flexible regions of the portal and/or the surrounding DNA and protein densities that deviate from 12-fold symmetry, which are present in the map and therefore factored into the estimation.",

To create a mask for focused classification of CATC, one CATC-containing region with its corresponding triplex Ta was manually traced using volume_tracer in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004), after which a mask encompassing the traced region was created by relion_mask_create in Relion. Focused classification of the masked region was then performed on symmetry-expanded penton vertex sub-particles with neither angular nor offset search (using the \u2013skip_align parameter in Relion). Since classification was performed on such a small area relative to the whole reconstruction, we specified a tau factor of 10 during classification (Scheres, 2016). After 90 iterations, four classes were generated, among which only one class had apparent CATC density corresponding to 37.9% of symmetry-expanded masked regions, consistent with the occupancy calculated from a previous study (Dai et al., 2014). We therefore considered this a CATC-binding class. The other three classes, though of slightly differing map quality, clearly lacked CATC density while sharing the same triplex Ta orientation.

Moreover, in cases of two CATCs bound to a penton vertex, the two CATCs can either occupy registers adjacent to each other or registers with a gap (i.e., an empty register) in between. We named these two binding patterns \u201cortho-CATC\u2013binding\u201d and \u201cmeta-CATC\u2013binding,\u201d respectively. In instances of three CATCs bound to a penton vertex, the two vacant registers can either be adjacent or have a gap (i.e., an occupied register) between them, analogous to the case of two vertex-bound CATCs. We thus named these two permutations \u201cortho-CATC\u2013absent\u201d and \u201cmeta-CATC\u2013absent,\u201d respectively. Altogether, eight classes of penton vertices are possible.

We then counted the number of orientations (out of five symmetry-expanded orientations per sub-particle) assigned to the CATC-binding class for each penton vertex sub-particle. This counted number of orientations, ranging from zero to five, reflects the number of CATCs bound to that particular vertex in that viral particle.

Orientations of one-CATC\u2013binding and four-CATC\u2013binding vertices were chosen as their single orientation in the CATC-binding and CATC-absent classes, respectively.
