By January 28, public health experts were immediately able\nto trace the importation and transmission of the disease in the country from the first\ncases as published in the New England Journal of Medicine.1 The following case\nthat emerged came from a Vietnamese businesswoman who returned to Vietnam on January 17,\n2020, after a 2-month business trip in Wuhan. This was considered to be the first case\nof a Vietnamese citizen being infected by the disease. A comprehensive case study on the\nVietnamese woman published by the Lancet Infectious Diseases2 mentioned that\n\u201cindividuals who had substantial contact with the patient and her two colleagues were\nquarantined and all accommodations and transit methods were decontaminated.\u201d",
