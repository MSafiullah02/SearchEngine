According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world has witnessed the emergence of several disease outbreaks and epidemics caused by more than 20 infectious agents over the past decade. 1 Some of these epidemics were caused by novel infectious agents such as H1N1 2 and MERS. 3 Over the past two decades, the emergence of coronavirus-associated diseases (SARS and MERS) inflicted global challenges to public health systems. 4 SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent for coronavirus disease COVID-19) is the latest addition to this growing list of unwelcomed novel agents. 5 The WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.",

This is exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic where the appearance of a seemingly limited cluster of cases of pneumonia linked to a sea food market in Wuhan, China 7 has become one of the worst pandemics in human history with a staggering number of more than 1.4 million infections in 177 countries and more than 85 000 deaths globally as of 9 April 2020. 8 It is worth noting that only a few of the current 177 countries affected seem to have passed the peak of the epidemic while the majority of these countries are just beginning to see a surge in cases.",

As of 10 April 2020, there are more than 1300 preprints in medRxiv and bioRxiv related to the COVID-19 research. 11 As a result of this unprecedented rapid and effective scientific response and prompt information sharing, it took the scientific community a few weeks to characterize the outbreak, identify the causative agent, share its genome, and develop highly specific diagnostics. For the first time in the history of pandemics, a prompt and real-time communication of knowledge and sharing of information between scientists, infectious disease specialists, public health professionals, policymakers, and the general public is possible.",

Nevertheless, a myriad of investigational regimens are being explored. In its efforts to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, the WHO has recently launched an international clinical trial called the Solidarity Trial. 13 The trial will compare four treatment options (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta-1a, and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) against the standard of care with the aim of rapidly determining whether any of the investigational therapeutics are effective against COVID-19.",
