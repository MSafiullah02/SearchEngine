It is currently classified into three species on the basis of gene sequencing analysis. These include HRV-A, HRV-B, and the recently discovered HRV-C [5,6]. There are >100 distinct serotypes of HRV species according to their surface proteins. This biological diversity makes it difficult to develop vaccines or antivirals against HRV. Understanding the epidemiological, clinical, and immunological features of HRV will help to prevent and treat HRV respiratory diseases. However, these characteristics have yet to be completely assessed. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of HRV infections in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections. We also compared the T-helper1(Th1)- and Th2-related cytokine profiles of HRV infection in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) to assess the immune responses of the disease.",

Patients were excluded if they were immunocompromised due to HIV infection, malignancy, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation or use of immunosuppressive drugs such as long-term systemic corticosteroids or radiation therapy. NPAs were obtained by suction using a fine, flexible plastic catheter and syringe. After collection, NPAs were immediately transported at 4\u00b0C to the laboratory, where they were stored at -70\u00b0C until use. Patient demographic and clinical data including medical history, detailed signs and symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory and radiology results were collected from a retrospective review of the medical records and interviews upon admission. Disease severity was assessed according to a respiratory symptom scoring system based on previously published studies [7,8].",

In accordance with previous studies [13,23\u201325], we found that HRV-B was the least frequently detected HRV species, and chest retraction infections caused by this virus was not observed. There are two hypotheses to explain this. It is possible that HRV-B causes a mild form of disease that does not warrant hospitalization, accounting for its lower detection rate in hospital-based studies compared to those of the other HRV species. Another possibility is that the genetic and biological fitness of HRV-B leads to its low frequency. One recent article reported that, even in healthy young children, HRV-B was the least frequently detected species of the three [26]. This finding supports the hypothesis that the frequency and virulence of HRV-B may be related to its genetic fitness, rather than selection bias.",

Most previous studies reported that a high HRV viral load was correlated to clinical severity or wheezing [27\u201329]. However, other reports show no correlation between the viral load and severity of the lower respiratory infection [30,31]. Similarly, we did not observe a correlation between the HRV viral load and clinical features or laboratory data. Our results suggest that the difference in disease severity may be more related to the host\u2019s susceptibility to HRV than to the viral load. Viral load can vary according to the sampling process. Therefore, the exact relationship between HRV viral load and disease severity merits further investigation.",
