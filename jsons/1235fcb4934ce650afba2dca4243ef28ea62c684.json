In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz. normal, other disease, pneumonia and Covid \u2212 19. A 5fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as 95.3% \u00b1 0.02. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with clinical findings, as validated by experts.",

Although this outbreak had its start as an epidemic in Wuhan, China, today it has severely affected multiple countries around the world as a pandemic. There is currently no effective cure for this virus and there is an urgent need to increase global knowledge in its mechanisms of infection, lung parenchyma damage distribution and associated patterns; not only for the disease detection or diagnosis, but also to support the design of curative therapy.

While a high-resolution CT is highly preferable, the portable chest X-rays are helpful for dealing with critically ill patients who are immobile. Daily routine portable chest X-rays are recommended for critically ill patients. Given that CT is more reliable to check changes in the lungs, as compared to the high false negatives in the commonly used random tests like PCR; its importance in the context of COVID-19 becomes all the more evident. Conspicuous ground-glass opacity and multiple mottling lesions, in the peripheral and posterior lungs on X-Ray and CT images, are indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia [5] .

Bacterial pneumonia is usually lobar, ie., confined to one or more lobes. It is characterized by inflammatory exudates within the intraalveolar space, resulting in consolidation that affects a large and continuous area of the lobe of a lung. A viral pneumonia, on the other hand, is usually interstitial; showing up in CT as diffuse bronchopneumonia or interstitial pneumonia across several fissures and lobes [5] . It is characterized by patchy foci of consolidation scattered in one or more lobes of one or both lungs.

[7] COVID-19 image data collection 3 (180 cases). The chest X-Ray images of normal samples, and of 14 lung, heart and chest-related disease samples 4 were obtained from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset 5 ; composed of 108,948 frontalview chest X-Ray images from 32,717 unique patients. Sample images of COVID-19 and Pneumonia are shown in Fig. 1 . Based on all these X-Ray data sources, we prepared two datasets termed Data-A and Data-B. The Data-A is generated from the \"NIH Chest X-ray Dataset\" and consists of two classes normal and disease. The disease class is composed of all the 13 lung, heart and chest-related diseases, as mentioned above, excluding the pneumonia. Data-B has four classes, corresponding to normal, other disease, pneumonia and Covid \u2212 19. Images for normal and pneumonia classes are taken from the \"NIH Chest X-ray Dataset\". While all the 322 images of the pneumonia class were considered, the 350 images from the normal class were randomly sampled. For the other disease class we randomly picked 50 images from the six pathology classes, viz. \"Atelectasis\", \"Cardiomegaly\", \"Infiltration\", \"Effusion\", \"Nodule\" and \"Mass\", which sometimes co-occurred with pneumonia as depicted in Fig. 2 [8] . It basically represents the co-occurrence of multiple pathology classes, which also matches with experts' domain knowledge. For example, as evident from the figure, the class \"Infiltration\" is often associated with \"Atelectasis\" and \"Effusion\".",

Greater number of filters, involving deeper convolution layers, allows for more feature maps to be generated; thereby compensating for the decrease in the size of each feature map caused by \"valid\" convolution and pooling layers. The convolution layer is said to be of type \"valid\" when the input to the layer is not zero-padded before the convolution operation, such that the resulting output becomes gradually smaller down the layers in terms of input dimension.",

Adam optimization algorithm was used for hyperparameter optimization for training the CNN from the scratch on Data-A with an initial learning rate 10 \u22123 , and decayed according to cosine annealing. Real time data augmentation was also used in terms of random rotation, scaling, and mirroring. A balanced validation dataset of size 20,000 was created by random sampling from the training set and used for validating the CNN model after each training epoch, for parameter selection and detection of overfitting. The model was trained for 100 epochs and the weights which achieved the best validation accuracy were retained.
