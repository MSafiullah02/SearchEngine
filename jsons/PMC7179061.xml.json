To begin, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, a bond credit rating agency, changed its financial outlook for not-for-profit and public hospitals in the United States from stable to negative in mid-March 2020.5 This is a strong signal from the financial investment community about their concern about the financial stability of the health care sector in these turbulent times. Their justification is based on the following: (1) likelihood of lower cash flows in the health care sector because of reductions in profitable services in preparation for surges of COVID-19 cases, (2) increased expenses in the health care sector because of higher staffing costs and supply needs, (3) lack of an inpatient diagnostic-related group for COVID-19, and (4) greater use of expensive ICU care. Further, the value of hospital investment portfolios will decline, and rising unemployment rates will result in loss of health benefits for patients. Moody\u2019s reassured the bond investment community that the majority of hospitals will withstand the COVID-19 disruption, and those with strong operating cash flow margins and sufficient days cash on hand will fare better than those that don\u2019t have these characteristics. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act just passed by Congress directly addresses many of the short-term issues raised by Moody\u2019s.6 As the pandemic wears on, will the financial support provided to hospitals by the CARES Act\u2014including to AMCs\u2014be sufficient to sustain the nation\u2019s health care system through the crisis?",
