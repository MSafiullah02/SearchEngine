If the season cannot resume due to an external shock such as the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, the ranking of the teams becomes non-trivial because it is necessary to account for schedule imbalances. We identify a set of desired axioms for ranking in such incomplete tournaments and verify that the generalized row sum, a parametric family of scoring rules, satisfies all of them. In particular, the well-established least squares method maximizes the role of the opponents. Our approach is applied for the five major premier European soccer competitions, where the rankings are found to be robust concerning the weight of adjustment for the opponents. Since disregarding the majority of the matches without promotion, relegation, and qualification for international cups would be unfair and unjustified, some simpler alternative policies are also discussed.",

Should a reasonable subset of the matches be considered?

Its parameter reflects the weight of the adjustment for the strength of the opponents, which is maximized by the least squares method, a well-established procedure in social choice theory and statistics. According to our computations for five popular sports leagues, the current ranking-after corrected for the number of matches played as in the 2019/20 Handball-Bundesliga-remains robust to the role of the opponents.

First, according to our knowledge, this feature is not taken into account in any European soccer league even though it would make sense in certain formats. In the 2019/20 season, the leagues in Hungary and Kosovo are organized with 12 teams playing a triple round-robin tournament, hence some teams play against others twice at home and once away, or vice versa. In addition, certain teams play one match less at home than other teams. The same format was used in Finland until 2018. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the 12 teams play a triple round-robin tournament in the initial stage. After 33 games, the league is split into two sections of six teams each such that every team plays once more all the five teams in their section. Consequently, it is impossible to balance the home-away pattern by guaranteeing that each club plays twice at home and twice away against any other club in its section. While these unbalanced schedules generate interesting research problems, for example, concerning the measurement of competitive balance (Lenten, 2008) , the number of points-and further tie-breaking rules-are not adjusted for the inherent inequality.",

This is straightforward in sports where a win plus a loss is equivalent to two draws since wins can be awarded by > 0, draws by zero, and losses by \u2212 < 0. However, some sports do not apply this symmetric setting, mainly because of the three points rule, which has become the standard in soccer: wins earn three points, draws earn one point, and losses earn zero points. It has many deficiencies from a theoretical point of view, for instance, reversing all results does not necessarily reverse the ranking and the number of total points allocated depends not only on the number of matches played.

This stands in stark contract to Swiss-system chess team tournaments, where accounting for the opponents can substantially affect the ranking, particularly for the middle teams (Csat\u00f3, 2017) . The probable reason is the large number of matches already played. It is a favorable finding, which indicates that freezing the current standing-with the tie-breaking rules according to Tables 2 and 3-or using the quotient rule (normalized scores) would be relatively fair.",

Compared to the ranking induced by the number of points, the only change is on the fourth position as officially Real Sociedad overtakes Getafe due to more goals scored, but the latter team has faced stronger opponents. This difference has fundamental sporting effects since the fourth club automatically qualifies for the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, and the fifth goes only to the UEFA Europa League.",

On the other hand, the seventh place-guaranteeing a slot in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League-should be given to one of the teams that scored 35 points, Hellas Verona or Parma as the additional match played by Milan is seemingly responsible for its advantage of one point. Although Parma has worse goal difference, this club has faced stronger opponents than Hellas Verona. The situation in the Premier League is analogous to Serie A. While Arsenal has one point less, 40, compared to Tottenham Hotspur, this is compensated by the fewer number of games played for small values of .

Teams with bold points have played one match less. Tie-breaking rules: fewer matches played, goal difference, goals scored. The generalized row sum and least squares methods do not require tie-breaking. Finally, recall that the least squares rating vector can be computed recursively according to formula (1). Accounting for the strength of direct opponents, that is, vector q (1) almost always induces the same ranking as the final rating vector q, the only exception being that Lyon with 40 points in Ligue 1 is ranked above Angers having 39 points only after considering the opponents of opponents. 5 In these examples, primarily the direct impact",
