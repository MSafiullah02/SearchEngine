Following the initial outbreak, the virus spread to other countries via asynchronous patterns, a pattern typical for infectious diseases due to the presence of multiple contagion sources. On January 30, 2020, the WHO changed the status of the outbreak to confirm a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On March 11 COVID-19 was reclassified as a pandemic by the WHO, and impacted over 100 countries over the following number of weeks.2\n,\n3\n",

As of the evening (20:10) of 21st April 2020, Egypt was ranked 50th out of 212 areas and countries in terms of the number of patients infected; 147th out of all areas and countries reporting infections with regards to the total number of infected individuals reported (with 36 infections per one million population), 106th with regards to the infection recovery rate (26.6% infection recovery), and 34th with regards to the number of deaths per total infected (7.5%). Until 21st April, Egypt was reported to have had a total of 3659 infected, 935 recovered; 1270 negative test results and 276 deaths [ref: https://www.care.gov.eg/EgyptCare/Index.aspx]. It is challenging for healthcare authorities to publishing accurate figures, reflecting actual totals, and in real time. The reasons for this may well be linked to limited testing capacity and difficulties in identifying the cause of death. a 14-day quarantine period was implemented and other preventative measures such as a partial curfew; with the Government of Egypt announcing an extension of the nationwide curfew for two further weeks, until April 23rd, 2020.5 The curfew covered the hours between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. All commercial enterprises and shops were prevented from working after 6:00 p.m. except food outlets and pharmacies. From April 24th to May 23rd (during Ramadan) The Presidency of the Council of Egyptian Ministers relaxed some of these preventative measures such as reducing the curfew by 3 h (such that it covered 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and allowed some businesses and government services offices to reopen in order to stimulate the economy and facilitate cultural/social practices during Ramadan.",

However, pharmacies were unable to fulfil their classic role in healthcare as a source of medication, as pharmaceutical measures such as a COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral medicines were not available at time of writing and will not be widely available for a long time. In the current absence of medical treatment and vaccination, the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic can only be brought under control by significant, rapid and widespread behavioral changes. Social and administrative science data could help mitigate the COVID-19 crisis to provide insight into public perceptions of risk, protective behaviors and preparedness measures, public trust and knowledge as well as misinformation.14 The methods of communication and channels of information used by the populace are changing on a continual basis; it is now of the utmost importance that social science research incorporates information from social media, as many authorities, including the WHO, use this to reach out to people.",

The questionnaire included 84 questions divided into three sections. The first section comprised 12 questions covering pharmacists' demographics (position, years\u2019 experience, and gender), the demographics of the customers with suspected COVID-19 symptoms (age and gender) and the nature and degree of symptoms reported by customers to community pharmacists. The second section contained 69 polar alternative (yes/no answer) questions covering six domains related to the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) the ability to provide products, (2) infection control, (3) practice surrounding patient education, (4) knowledge and awareness, (5) barriers, and (6) facilitators. The final section comprised three open-ended questions pertaining to whether questions should be removed, added or modified, required sentence formatting (composition, terminology), validity of questionnaire content, and seeking any other comments. The first two sections comprised questions that were predominantly closed\u2010ended, although space was provided for expansion. The final section provided the opportunity at the end of the questionnaire for respondents to add any further comments on the topic.",

The final section of open-ended questions was removed. Invitations to take part in the research were distributed in printed format to community pharmacies in Egypt. Envelopes were addressed to \u201cthe pharmacist\u201d to ensure that respondents were actively working in community pharmacy, and also to maximize the response rate through obtaining the attention of the pharmacist. Data collectors then visited community pharmacists in person, to conduct the interview. One pharmacist was interviewed in each private community pharmacy. All questions had yes/no answers, except those with multiple closed options, e.g. regions (North, Centre, South, or East), position (junior, senior, or manager), and years' experience (list of numbers). Each questionnaire was assigned a specific data collector (name and ID) to allow the researcher to contact them if necessary. Data collectors were asked to complete the interviews within a two week period and submit the answers electronically using Google forms. Following electronic submission of completed responses, all participant data were anonymized. As such, the survey design had the advantages of capturing responses from individual personnel covering a large geographical range, with great rapidity. The present article covers 4 domains out of the 6 covered in the survey, comprising 45 questions out of the total 69. These 4 domains are: (1) the ability to provide products, (2) infection control, (3) knowledge and awareness, and (4) practices surrounding patient education. The results have been divided into two manuscripts as relevant to the relative directions of the objectives of the study. The present manuscript deals with the four domains covering preparedness of community pharmacies for the COVID-19 pandemic (internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha = 0.773). 24 further questions covering the two remaining domains (barriers and facilitators) relate to a different objective; the development and scaling up of services provided through community pharmacies (Cronbach's alpha = 0.744).",

Therefore, such communication can be assisted and reinforced using posters, banners or signs on display in a prominent position, for example on the door as they enter, to inform patients about services the pharmacy can provide at this time as well as educating them as to best practice behaviors.

As a result, governments and policymakers are doing all they can to address this shortage. Community pharmacists are exposed to high infection risks, and are especially vulnerable due to frequent contact with patients. Accordingly, infection control measures should be considered during all staff interactions with each other (maintaining workplace hygiene and waste management) and with customers (maintaining physical distance, taking care handling prescriptions, use of contactless payment methods, and providing suspected COVID-19 patients with their own definite area and free masks and hand sanitizers). It is paramount to ensure the health and safety of frontline pharmacists amongst other healthcare professionals to ensure continuity and functionally of their roles in the community. Educating customers, especially those at high risk, is essential during a pandemic. Posters, banners or signs must include regularly updated information so as to decrease patient contact and reduce crowding in-store. Pharmacists' own awareness and up-to-date knowledge are also essential. Accordingly, pandemic preparedness of pharmacists must not be overlooked, and should be extended to knowledge of accurate reporting procedures.
