According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, 2003a, World Travel and Tourism Council, 2003b, World Travel and Tourism Council, 2003c, World Travel and Tourism Council, 2003d, the outbreak of the SARS disease led to the collapse of the tourism industry in the most severely affected Asian countries, namely China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam. SARS is estimated to have cost these four countries over US $20 billion in lost GDP, and a reduction of more than 70% across the rest of Asia, even in countries that were totally disease free (Mckercher and Chon, 2004).",
