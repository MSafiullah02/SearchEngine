In the context of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), these two drugs have been proposed as possible treatments. The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of Page 2 of 17 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease. Meanwhile, serious adverse drug reactions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine, justifying to limit its prescription, and to perform suitable cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring.",

They thus have the capacity to inhibit the pH-dependent entry of certain viruses into host cells, or even to block the replication of enveloped viruses by inhibiting the glycosylation of envelope proteins [5] . These in vitro antiviral effects have raised a lot of hope, opening-up consideration of the repositioning of these old and inexpensive drugs for the management of many viral infections, against which there are no or few effective treatments, or against which drugs exist but are not widely available, especially in countries with limited resources [6] .",

            "text": "The demonstration of antiviral activity in vitro is obviously not synonymous with efficacy on clinically relevant parameters. Several studies have demonstrated an effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on the replication of HIV in vitro [7] . However, a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing hydroxychloroquine at 400 mg/day to placebo in 83 HIV positive patients not treated with antiretrovirals and having a CD4 level >400/\u00b5L, showed after 48 weeks of treatment a greater decrease in CD4, and an increased viral load, in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to controls [8] . Such paradoxical effect was also observed in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the efficacy of 5 days of chloroquine to placebo in patients infected with chikungunya. Besides the lack of effect of chloroquine on the viremia, patients in the chloroquine group had significantly more arthralgia than those in the placebo group [9] , despite an inhibitory effect of chloroquine on the replication of the virus in vitro [10] . In the case of chikungunya, this clinical versus laboratory discrepancy might be explained by the immunomodulatory effects of these drugs, which modify the cellular and humoral immune response to infection [10] . In other indications, such as the treatment of dengue fever or the prevention of influenza, chloroquine proved to be ineffective despite in vitro activity [3, [11] [12] [13] . Finally, activity against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been described [14] . A pilot clinical trial conducted in a dozen patients with HCV (genotype 1) who did not respond to the combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin, showed a reduction in viral load and in ALT, but this effect ceased on stopping chloroquine (Table 1 ) [15] . Thus, to date, despite many promising in vitro leads, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have never been shown to have any real clinical efficacy in the treatment or prevention of viral infections [16] . Several reasons may explain the discrepancy between in vitro and clinical results, such as the validity of the experimental model, or pharmacokinetic issues, i.e. reaching sufficient inhibitory concentration at the site of infection.",

This hypothesis was confirmed in vitro, chloroquine inhibiting the replication of the SARS-Cov virus at concentrations close to those used in patients treated for malaria [17] . Subsequent work, still in vitro, confirmed these results and also suggested a possible prophylactic effect [18] . In 2014, chloroquine was described as having in vitro activity on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-Cov) [19] .

In vitro studies have shown that chloroquine [20] , and also hydroxychloroquine, exhibits antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with a lower EC50 for hydroxychloroquine (0.72 \u00b5M vs 5.47 \u00b5M at 48 h) suggesting more potent activity [21] . In this same article, the authors developed a PB/PK model for these two drugs, in order to simulate their diffusion in pulmonary tissue with several dosage regimens while taking into account the safety profile. Based on simulations, they propose for hydroxychloroquine a loading dose of 400 mg twice on day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice a day for the next four days. At these dosages, simulations show apparently low plasma concentrations, of the order of 0.1 \u03bcg/mL, but which could allow significant pulmonary exposure with very high tissue-free inhibitor quotients, of about 85 from day 5 after the start of treatment [21, 22] . Yet, other reports have shown about 10-fold higher EC50, or a higher potency for chloroquine than hydroxychloroquine, highlighting substantial variability between in vitro models [23, 24] . This stresses the difficulty to extrapolate that appropriate drug concentration at the site of infection will be reached with safe doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.",

In this case, the use of geographic controls does not protect against a possible selection bias. In addition, of the 26 patients who received hydroxychloroquine, six left the trial prematurely; among these, three were transferred to intensive care, and a fourth died. An intention-to-treat analysis should not exclude these patients, but should consider these cases as failures of treatment with hydroxychloroquine. In the control group, the result of the primary endpoint (PCR on day 6, D6) was not available for 5 of the 16 subjects, nearly 30%, whom the authors considered to be positive, i.e. carrying the virus. Another point concerns PCR results, which were not reported in the same way for 10 patients in the control group (compared to the 6 other controls and 20 patients in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine). The results of these PCRs also seem to be very variable: two patients in the control group, negative on D5 were again positive on D6, and counted as such for the main endpoint. However, in the arm treated with hydroxychloroquine, a patient found negative on D5 and for whom the data was missing on D6 was presumed negative. By re-analyzing the data actually available on D6, the difference between the groups is no longer significant, suggesting a possible risk of p-hacking, which consists of multiplying the comparisons until obtaining a p-value below the significance threshold. This obviously increases the risk of a false positive. The article also concludes that azithromycin is effective, but these results relate only to a series of 6 patients, without randomization. These results were supplemented by the pre-publication, by the same team, of a cohort of 1061 patients receiving a combination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin early after the first symptoms, and followed-up during nine days or longer. The results show a rate of poor clinical outcome (prolonged hospitalisation, transfer to intensive care, or death) of 4.3%, and 0.75% mortality [28] , i.e. close to that observed among infected people in France [29] .",

The first study, conducted in four hospitals in France, compared 84 patients with pneumonia requiring oxygen, and who received hydroxychloroquine, to 89 controls. The results show no difference between the two groups regarding the risk of transfer to intensive care or death [30] . A second study reports data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, in the USA. Among 368 patients, 97 received hydroxychloroquine alone, 113 had hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and 158 were unexposed to hydroxychloroquine. The results suggest a higher risk of death in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, without any difference between the three groups regarding the risk of ventilation [31] . These two studies were later completed by two larger cohorts of patients admitted to the hospital in New York, USA. The first one (n = 1376) did not show any significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and the primary end point of respiratory failure (HR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.32) [32] . Of note, almost 60% of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine in that cohort also received azithromycin, while this proportion was 37.2% in propensity-matched patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine. In the second large cohort (n = 1438), hydroxychloroquine used was not associated with a decrease in in-hospital hospital mortality, whether associated with azithromycin or used alone [33] . However, the non-randomized nature of these studies exposes to bias and prevents from drawing clear conclusions.",

Another Chinese study (ChiCTR2000029559) concluded to the superiority of hydroxychloroquine (5 days at 400 mg/day) over standard treatment in treating fever, cough, and associated pneumonia [35] . Yet, we cannot exclude significant reporting bias, since the outcomes, the number of patients, and the dose regimens reported in this study differed from those initially declared in the registry. The largest randomized trial was an openlabel, multicenter study including 75 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared with 75 patients receiving standard of care. The dose was higher than on the previous trials (loading dose of 1200 mg/day for three days followed by 800 mg/day for 2 or 3 weeks, according to the severity of the disease). The results do not show any difference in viral clearance at day 28 (primary outcome).

This could be explained by frequent hypokalemia in these patients, possibly due to a particular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 towards the ACE2 angiotensin-converting enzyme [51] . Also, diarrhea and vomiting can be associated with the infection. It is therefore essential to monitor potassium level and to correct any hypokalemia before administering hydroxychloroquine, which itself can cause diarrhea. Similarly, the combination of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine justifies reinforced monitoring, with an ECG if possible before the start of treatment, and within 3-4 h after the first administration. And then twice a week for the duration of treatment or in the event of symptoms suggestive of a heart rhythm disorder.",

Pending their results, the lack of evidence of a possible benefit must be weighed against the known ADRs of hydroxychloroquine, which may be magnified in COVID-19 patients.
