The 716 bp fragments produced by PCR assay were further digested with four restriction enzymes, MluI, HincII, SacII, HaeIII, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. When the PCR products from the 50 PRRSV isolates were subjected to RFLP analysis, it showed that 2, 6, 3, and 6 distinguishable digestion patterns were generated by MluI, HincII, SacII, HaeIII, respectively (Table 1) . To facilitate the reporting and handling of test data, each isolate was given a numerical code for its ORF 5 RFLP pattern with enzymes, MluI, HincII, SacII, HaeIII, in that order. MluI either does not cut (code 1) or does cut (code 2) ( Fig. 2A) . HincII has 6 different cutting patterns, including a no cut pattern, which is designated code 1 (Fig. 2B ). SacII has 3 cutting patterns, including a no cut pattern (code 1) (Fig. 2C) . HaeIII has 6 different cutting patterns, including a not cut pattern, which is designated code 1 (Fig. 2D) . In this manner, all PRRSV strains are given a code based on their ORF 5 cutting patterns. Combining the restriction enzyme digestion patterns obtained with MluI, HincII, SacII, HaeIII, we observed 19 distinct RFLP patterns from the 50 PRRSV isolates tested (Table 1) .

However, the genomic variations that have been identified in the present study seemed to represent characteristic features of the Korean PRRSV isolates. RFLP analysis can be used to differentiate PRRSV isolates and results can be used to aid in epidemiologic investigations of outbreaks of PRRS in swine farms. With this method, PRRSV isolates are assigned a 4-digit RFLP code; the first digit is the MluI RFLP pattern, the second is the HincII pattern, the third is the SacII pattern, and the last digit is the HaeIII pattern. Thus, 17 out of 50 PRRSV isolates (33%) were same RFLP code for the vaccine virus which is 2-3-2-1. These data suggest the possibility that wild type PRRS viruses have 2-3-2-1 pattern or that, instead, the PRRSV isolates were actually the vaccine strain. Thus, to distinguish a PRRSV vaccine strain from other PRRSV field isolates in Korea, it may be necessary a series of alternative restriction enzyme cuts to obtain other RFLP patterns.",

It would be possible that the field isolates that prevailed in Korea before the introduction of modified live vaccine, had a very similar genetic structure to the vaccine and thus they coincidentally exhibit the same RFLP as the modified live PRRSV strain in use. Alternatively, one possibility that is tempting to be considered from the results reported herein is that the vaccine that started to be used on Korea since mid-1996 may have reverted to a more virulent form and that many isolates that are supposedly of field origin (i.e. those isolated from non-vaccinated herds which we used in this study) may have originated from the vaccine in the field, as has already been reported to occur in United States and Denmark [13, 17] . Notably, whereas the vaccine strain did not cause detectable pathologic changes other than some lymph node enlargement, field strains were associated with macroscopic and microscopic pulmonary lesions [17] . All field strains which were similar to vaccine strain in RFLP pattern in this study, were isolated from pigs with severe interstitial pneumonia. Analysis of the data reported here and elsewhere [2, 17] suggest that, under certain conditions, virus in an vaccine can persist, mutate, and eventually, as a result of mutation, cause a clinically relevant response in pigs.",

RFLPs produced by one enzyme in the selected DNA fragment represent one nucleotide difference, therefore, if mutation occurs at that nucleotide, the vaccine virus can no longer be identified by the RFLP patterns of the enzyme. Seven PRRSV isolates have the same RFLP code for three digits, 2-3-2 but have different RFLP code for last digit from PRRSV vaccine virus. Therefore, the profile of PCR-RFLP patterns of several enzyme is meaningful for critical discrimination of the vaccine virus.",

Sequence analysis of ORF5 from North American and European isolates showed a high level of variation [11, 15] . Results of the present study demonstrate that ORF5 is also diverse in Korean isolates. The genetic diversity of ORF5 gene together with the observation that antigenicity of E protein encoded by ORF5 is diverse may have important information for development of a vaccine. The E protein encoded by ORF5 will not be a suitable candidate for the design of a subunit vaccine. Nowadays, as shown here, PCRbased RFLP methods are simple but powerful tools that allow the genetic diversity of PRRSV isolates. This may also contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen.",
