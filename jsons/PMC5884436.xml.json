            "text": "In 1993, this journal published a review concluding that while limited evidence for all of the theories on the biological roles of glycans was available, exceptions to each could also be found (1). Some general principles were suggested. First, the reported biological consequences of experimental modification of glycosylation seemed highly variable, making it difficult to predict a priori the functions that a given glycan structure might be mediating, or its relative importance to the organism. Second, limited data suggested that the same glycan might mediate different functions at different locations within an organism, or at different times in its ontogeny. Third, the more specific intrinsic biological roles of glycans known at the time appeared to be mediated by unusual glycan sequences, unusual presentations of common sequences or further modifications of glycans. But it was also noted that such sequences were more likely to be targets for specific recognition by toxins and pathogenic microorganisms. It was therefore posited that ongoing host\u2013pathogen interactions might contribute to the evolution of some aspects of intra- and interspecies glycan variation. Finally, some suggestions were made as to how one might elucidate more intrinsic biological functions for glycans. In particular, it was suggested that more studies of natural and induced mutations resulting in altered glycosylation within intact organisms would be required.",

For a while it was indeed possible for an individual to track and read such reviews on biological roles of glycans, but this became increasingly difficult over time. By a decade later it became impossible to do so, and one had to be content with tracking a sampling of reviews in areas of ongoing personal interest (105\u2013159). Meanwhile, some of the concepts in the original review were updated in a book chapter (160). Evolutionary and phylogenetic perspectives on the matter have also since been extensively addressed (161\u2013176). More recently, it has been emphasized that glycans are as universal in nature as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and metabolites (177), and as essential to the existence of all known living organisms (178). But as depicted in Figure 1, glycans are also the most structurally diverse and rapidly evolving major class of molecules. Taken together with much greater technical difficulties in their analysis, one can understand why the knowledge base regarding these major building blocks of life has lagged so far behind.\n",

The present review first surveys the history of how our understanding of biological roles of glycans originally evolved, and then attempts to update the overview as of mid-2016. As a measure of how much progress has been made, any attempt at being comprehensive is now impractical, and the knowledge base of a single individual cannot do justice to this vast and complex field. Thus, one is only able to illustrate general principles with a few selected examples, and with a strong emphasis on the expertise of the author. For the same reason, the bibliography of citations cannot be comprehensive. Also, most of the broad implications of glycosylation for biotherapeutics are not addressed (179).",

            "text": "It is assumed that the reader is generally familiar with the major types and classes of glycans found in nature, and the conventional terminologies for describing them (180). Of course, it is important to also recognize that the full range of types and distributions of glycans in nature are still largely unexplored, and surprises continue to emerge. To cite just a few examples, the following glycans were mostly unknown when the previous version of this review was being written: functional sialylation in the fly nervous system (181); O-fucose and O-glucose glycans on Notch (182\u2013184), and O-fucose on thrombospondin repeats (185); mucin type O-glycosylation in protists (initiated with \u03b1-GlcNAc instead of \u03b1-GalNAc) (186); O-linked N-acetylglucosamine on cell surface/extracellular proteins (187\u2013188); the C-mannose linkage to proteins (189\u2013190); the complexities of O-mannose-linked glycans in tissues such as muscle (191\u2013194), including the novel glycosaminoglycan attached on \u03b1-dystroglycan (195\u2013200) generated by a dual function xylosyl/glucuronosyltransferase (201\u2013204) and attached via novel ribitol-phosphate bridge (205\u2013208); a plant cell wall proteoglycan wherein a core arabinogalactan protein is glycosylated with cell wall matrix xylan and pectin glycans (209); identification of \u03b2-galacturonic acid in a xyloglucan involved in plant root hair tip growth (210); the expanding diversity of milk oligosaccharides (211), recognition of immunomodulatory glycans in the gut microbiome (212\u2013213); N-linked glycans in prokaryotes (214\u2013216) and, discovery of the large family of prokaryotic nonulosonic acids (217\u2013219), the likely ancestors of sialic acids (220). The last two examples highlight the realization that many glycosylation types once thought to be unique to eukaryotes in fact have their origins in earlier evolved pathways in bacteria and archea (176, 221\u2013222). In this regard, it is notable that many major taxa of life forms such as archea, fungi, protists and algae still remain poorly explored with regard to glycan structure and functions (many such taxa are not much addressed in this review).",

Beyond their well-known roles in energy generation and metabolism, glycans obviously had many structural and biophysical roles in many systems, including nutritional storage. Given the dense coating of complex and diverse glycans on essentially all cell surfaces (sometimes called the \u201cglycocalyx\u201d in animal cells) as well as on most extracellular molecules, it was also not surprising to find many examples of infectious agents or symbiotic organisms that recognized such glycans with a high degree of specificity, mediating interactions with their hosts (223). Additionally many pathogens were found to express highly specific glycans on their own surfaces, which seemed to modulate their antigenicity and/or their susceptibility to bacteriophages. Meanwhile, pathogens were also found to elaborate highly specific exo- and endoglycosidases that could degrade host glycans. In fact, many of the structural details of eukaryotic glycans were initially deduced by using such microbial glycosidases as tools (224\u2013226).",

Meanwhile, great strides were made in elucidating the structures of glycans in some taxa (particularly vertebrates), as well in understanding their biosynthetic pathways. The development of vertebrate cell lines with defined defects in most glycosylation pathways provided powerful and conclusive evidence for many complex glycan biosynthetic pathways, and tools for their in-depth study (229\u2013240), especially N-linked glycans on glycoproteins. Ironically, in vitro viability of these remarkable cell lines despite their gross defects in glycosylation raised questions in the minds of some scientists, as to whether complex glycans have specific and critically important functions intrinsic to intact vertebrate organisms.",

Some of the \u201cblood groups\u201d that limited blood transfusion between individual humans could be explained by intraspecies variations in glycosylation (241). The effects of glycosidase pretreatment on the subsequent intravascular trafficking of blood cells in vivo raised the possibility that glycans might serve as targeting signals (242). The role of mammalian \u0251-lactalbumin in the generation of lactose in milk had also been elucidated (243), but the functional relevance of the resulting profusion of species-specific milk oligosaccharides elaborated from a lactose core oligosaccharide (244) remained elusive. A consistent finding of altered glycosylation in malignant cells suggested specific roles in cancer progression (245\u2013247). The selective reaggregation of dispersed sponge cells was shown to be due to carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate interactions between large acidic glycans (248).",

But the intrinsic biological function of this highly specific hepatocyte endocytic receptor remained obscure at the time. Regardless, the concept that a terminal sugar on a glycan could act as an intraorganismal targeting signal was established, and evidence then emerged for a mannose receptor on macrophages (251\u2013252) and possibly one for mannose 6-phosphate on other cell types (253\u2013254). The isolation and characterization of many plant and animal glycan-binding proteins by methods such as affinity chromatography occurred in parallel (255\u2013263). During this period, the well-known pharmacological anticoagulant effect of the natural glycosaminoglycan heparin was shown to be due to a highly specific interaction of antithrombin with a particular 3-O-sulfated sequence (264\u2013266) within the heparin chain. These and other such findings provided indirect evidence that complex glycans might carry out specific functions of intrinsic value to the complex multicellular organisms that synthesized them. However, as of the end of the 1970s there remained no direct proof that glycans played such key biological roles. Even as late as 1988, the introduction to a major symposium on the topic stated that \u201c...while the functions of DNA and proteins are generally known...it is much less clear what carbohydrates do...\u201d (267).",

Signal transmission depended on the precise stereochemistry of the glycans (282\u2013284). This concept of \u201coligosaccharins\u201d was extended to other glycan fragments that could manipulate morphogenetic pathways of tobacco explants (285) providing preliminary evidence that glycans by themselves might act as signaling molecules internal to a species. Meanwhile, studies in animals indicated that sialidase treatment could abrogate the interaction of lymphocytes with high endothelial venules in lymph nodes (286) leading to the correct prediction that sialylated glycan signals were involved in the trafficking of lymphocytes out of the circulation. Along with other convergent lines of evidence, this eventually resulted in the definition of a family of cell adhesion molecules (287\u2013288) that were critical for leukocyte rolling on endothelium, prior to their exit from the circulation. These molecules were called \u201cselectins\u201d (289), and they recognized a common motif, consisting of sialylated fucosylated glycans (7, 13, 24, 91, 103, 128, 140, 290\u2013309); a topic that has continued to blossom, with implications for many fields.",

Discovery of the sialic acid-binding properties of sialoadhesin (324) and of CD22 (325), followed by the cloning of sialoadhesin (326), led to the definition of a new family of cell-type-specific vertebrate lectins initially called \u201csialoadhesins\u201d (15, 327), but eventually designated as a subfamily of I-type lectins (328) and renamed as the Siglecs (329). The previously discovered phosphomannosyl receptors were now redesignated as \u201cP-type\u201d Lectins (85) and some previously known plant lectins became founding members of the \u201cR-type\u201d (Ricin-like) and \u201cL-type\u201d (Legume lectin-like) families (330). The power of phylogenomic sequence comparisons has since revealed many additional families of lectins such as the X-type lectins (intelectins) (331\u2013333), Ficolins (334\u2013335), etc. The earlier-mentioned somatic cell mutants in pathways of N- and O-glycosylation played key roles in this progress. Along with the discovery of new human genetic disorders in glycosylation (see next section), these and many other clues to intrinsic biological roles of glycans in the 1990s finally opened up this vast and uncharted territory of biology. Combined with the accelerating power of genomics and glycomics, we have now reached a point where numerous biological roles of glycans have been elucidated, to varying degrees of precision.

            "text": "Many different approaches have been used to elucidate the biological roles of glycans. Among these, one of the most instructive has been the study of genetic alterations of glycosylation in model organisms, and in human diseases. Indeed as mentioned earlier, it was the discovery of the genetic defect in I-cell disease that conclusively proved the biological significance and importance of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting pathway in vivo. At about the same time a defect in 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate (PAPS) formation was found in brachymorphic mice with multiple sulfation defects. While PAPS has many roles, the disproportionately short stature of the mice was apparently due to undersulfation of chondroitin sulfate in epiphyseal growth-plate cartilages (336). Another decade went by (see Figure 2) before the second human biosynthetic defect specific to glycosylation was discovered, a deficiency of a glycosaminoglycan core galactosyltransferase in a progeria-like syndrome (337). Meanwhile, the concept of \u201cCarbohydrate Deficient Glycoprotein syndromes\u201d (CDGs) had been suggested, based on the finding that children with previously unexplained multisystem disorders showed under-glycosylation of serum transferrin (338\u2013341)\u2013\u2013a test originally devised to detect alcoholism via the general hypo-sialylation it causes in liver-derived serum glycoproteins (342)! The work of many investigators then led to the elucidation of the underlying enzymatic and genetic defects in these children (343\u2013350), eventually resulting in the repurposing of the acronym CDG to denote \u201cCongenital Disorders of Glycosylation\u201d (66, 351\u2013356). After a slow start in the early 1990s an international effort of many investigators has now resulted in a veritable explosion in discoveries of human genetic disorders of glycosylation (Figure 2) (61, 67, 191, 352, 357\u2013382). These disorders continue to provide a goldmine of clues to biological roles of glycans, and this understanding has begun to benefit some patients via simple monosaccharide replacement therapies (374, 383\u2013388). Notably, in a recent study of consecutively enrolled patients with unexplained intellectual developmental disorder and metabolic phenotypes, whole exome sequencing showed that >10% were attributable to genetic defects in glycosylation pathways (389), mostly hypomorphic states of genes in which complete loss would have been lethal.\n",

            "text": "Meanwhile, targeted genetic alterations of glycan biosynthetic pathways in mice (396\u2013401) also revealed a spectrum of abnormalities, again pointing to complex and varied functions of glycans in multicellular organisms. Since then, the list of mice with genetically altered glycosylation has expanded greatly, and resulting phenotypes have been highly instructive (98, 159). It is ironic that most of the glycosylation pathways that had earlier been dismissed because genetic defects caused \u201climited phenotypes\u201d in the reductionist environment of the tissue culture dish later turned out to have clear and serious consequences in the intact organism, even in the form of hypomorphic alleles in humans. On the other hand, the phenotypic outcome of gene knockouts has been rather unpredictable. For example, while the MGAT1/GnT-I null state (which prevents the processing of N-glycans) caused embryonic lethality in mice (397\u2013398), it generated no grossly obvious phenotype in the Arabidopsis plant (402\u2013403), and limited phenotypes in Drosophila (404). Conversely while mice lacking ST3GAL5 seem to have only moderate phenotypes (405\u2013406), humans with similar defects suffer from severe multisystem disease (407\u2013408). Of course, any report of a \u201cviable and fertile mouse with no major phenotype\u201d must be taken with a large grain of salt. For example, the consequences of altering complex ganglioside biosynthesis (409\u2013411) or of knocking out one of the key ganglioside receptors called MAG (412\u2013413) was mostly evident later in the life, or when the mouse was subjected to specific challenges (414\u2013415). In contrast, complete elimination of ganglioside biosynthesis gave an early embryonic lethal phenotype (416). Further complexity has arisen from the realization that there are multiple isozymes of some glycosyltransferases (417\u2013418), and that post-transcriptional regulation by micro-RNAs is occurring (419\u2013420).",

In general, complete elimination of major classes or subclasses of glycans tends to result in embryonic lethality, while defects in outer terminal structures often give viable organisms with defects in specific functions and/or specific cell types, although these impacts are often species specific. As an example, null alleles preventing the synthesis of the core glycosaminoglycan backbone of heparan sulfate causes embryonic lethality (421\u2013422), but the prevention of proper sulfation of this backbone can give living mice with specific defects (422\u2013427). When embryonic lethality makes it difficult to define specific biological roles, tissue-specific targeted genetic alterations became important (428\u2013430). Experiments of nature such as somatic mutations in X-linked genes (431) and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes (388\u2013389, 432) have also helped our understanding of functions.",

Ethambutol (a traditional drug treatment for tuberculosis) is now known to target the arabinofuranosyltransferases EmbA and EmbB (434). Knockouts of these genes in mycobacteria are lethal, as is the case with some other glycosyltransferases (435).

The first is structural and modulatory roles (including nutrient sequestration). The second category involves extrinsic (interspecies) recognition. The third is intrinsic (intraspecies) recognition. Finally, there is molecular mimicry of host glycans. All of these categories can involve glycan-binding proteins (see Figure 3). The next part of this review considers these classes of biological roles and discusses one or more examples of each. Given the vastness of relevant literature, the examples and citations are rather limited and biased towards the knowledge of the author. Examples of multifunctional roles of glycans and glycan-binding proteins that cross over between these somewhat arbitrary categories will be mentioned later.\n",

These polymers are also difficult to breakdown by physical, chemical or enzymatic means. Many other glycan polymers play major roles in fungal and plant cell wall structure and function (438\u2013447). For example, the hemicellulose xyloglucan not only plays a key role in the loosening and tightening of cellulose microfibrils, but also enables the plant cell to change its shape during growth and differentiation, and to retain its final shape after maturation (441). Needless to say, in the absence of these and many other major glycan polymers, the diversity of macroscopic structural variations in life forms on the planet would be far more limited.",

In addition to the polymers mentioned above, the dense layer of mucins that coats many epithelial surfaces such as the inner lining of airways and intestines provides critical barrier functions, including protection against the invasion by microorganisms that live within the lumen (139, 418, 448\u2013452). Disruption of this layer by genetically altering mucin backbones, O-linked glycosyltransferases (or key chaperones like Cosmc) can have very serious consequences, including inflammation and carcinogenesis associated with microbial invasion (453\u2013456). Likewise the thick and biochemically robust cell walls of plants make it difficult for invading fungi and bacteria to reach the membrane of the plant cells (438, 441, 444, 446\u2013447). In other instances, the thick layer of glycans also provides tissue strength. Nature is rife with many more such examples including fungal and bacterial cell walls and polysaccharide coats, and the glycosaminoglycans of vertebrate cartilage, which are partly responsible for its elasticity, resiliency and compressibility (457).",

A major fraction of such ER-synthesized proteins are also modified by N-linked glycans at Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons (494), and it is reasonable to think that the large, generally hydrophilic sugar chains contribute to proper folding of nascent polypeptides emerging into the lumen of the ER. Indeed, it has long been known that preventing N-linked glycosylation using the inhibitor tunicamycin can have negative effects on the initial folding of such proteins (495\u2013496). In keeping with the highly conserved structure of the initial glycan added to asparagine residues, we now know that such N-glycans play a much more precise role in actually directing the folding, via specific recognition of certain features of N-glycans (see further discussion on quality control below). Even at the level of initial protein folding the exact context of the sequon can dictate the outcome. For example, experimentally placing a phenylalanine residue two or three positions before a glycosylated asparagine in distinct reverse turns facilitates stabilizing interactions between the aromatic side chain and the first GlcNAc residue of the glycan, while increasing glycosylation efficiency (497).",

            "text": "In this context, it is worth noting that the vast majority of published crystal structures of naturally occurring glycoproteins are derived from proteins that either had their glycosylation sites mutated, or had their glycans partially or completely degraded, prior to crystallization. The practical reason for making such a drastic change is that glycans are often heterogeneous and have a high range of motion, making it difficult to obtain an ordered crystal. Even if crystallization is possible, the glycans are typically disordered within the resulting image. In instances where glycans are left intact, the glycoproteins are often expressed in heterologous cells, resulting in nonspecies-specific glycosylation. This major technical artifact is rarely addressed in prominent protein crystallography papers. The bottom line is that when glycosylation sites are mutated or glycosylation is modified, there is a significant possibility that the folded form defined by crystallography may not be the native state. Solving this technical problem remains a major challenge for the future (498\u2013500), one in which new techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (501\u2013502) may help. Meanwhile, it is definitely a worthwhile exercise to model the glycans back into the crystal structure to a best approximation (501, 503). Exceptions to the general lack of glycans in crystal structures can occur when the glycan is buried and partially immobilized within the folds of the protein, such as in the case of the Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) Fc-region (504\u2013506), or tightly packed on the surface, such as in the HIV virion (507\u2013509).",

This effect is particularly prominent for mucins carrying densely packed O-glycans (451, 510). Indeed, extended segments of some mucins are even resistant to broad-spectrum proteases like proteinase K (511\u2013512). This property can actually be taken advantage of, to isolate mucin segments away from other proteins that could be more easily proteolyzed into smaller fragments, or even from whole tissues (511\u2013512). In a prokaryotic example, N-glycosylation in Campylobacter improves fitness, by providing protection against proteases in the gut (513). Conversely, there is evidence that glycosylation at single sites can regulate specific cleavage events with large impacts on protein activity (514), e.g., the protection of Tango1 by O-glycosylation is critical to apical secretion in Drosophila (515).",

For example, subtly different forms of the sialylated ganglioside GM3 can have differential effects on tyrosine kinase signaling of the EGF receptor (517\u2013522) and elimination of GM3 affects insulin receptor action (405, 523\u2013524). Another classic example is the co-receptor activity of heparan sulfate in FGF signaling (525\u2013526). Glycosylation can also affect the signaling properties of the proteins to which it is attached. For example, \u02511-6 core fucosylation of N-glycans affects transforming growth factor (TGF) signaling (527). Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b21 receptor activation leads to abnormal lung development. While most core fucose-deficient mice die 3 d after birth, the survivors develop emphysematous changes of the lung. The underlying mechanism appears to be dysregulation of downstream TGF signaling, causing MMP gene activation, which eventually degrades alveolar membranes to give emphysema. In a similar vein, both sialylation and fucosylation modulate epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated intracellular signaling (528\u2013530).",

Before Fringe can act, Notch must first be glycosylated with an O-fucose, and the protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 is thus an essential component of Notch signaling pathways (531\u2013532). It was later discovered that the O-glucose modification on Notch added by a glucosyltransferase encoded by Rumi is also essential for Notch signaling and embryonic development (533\u2013534). Thus there are many roles of glycosylation in Notch signaling (535\u2013536). The structural basis of glycosylation-mediated Notch interactions with some of its ligands has been recently explored (537).",

GPI-anchored proteins are selectively targeted to the apical surface in fully polarized epithelial cells (541). It also stands to reason that the glycans on cell surface glycoproteins can modulate membrane domain organization by their bulk and charge (542\u2013543). It now appears that glycans on one class of glycoproteins can even modulate the organization of other classes of glycans on other proteins present on the same cell surface, perhaps forming \u201cclustered saccharide patches\u201d (146, 302, 544).

This in turn promotes focal adhesion assembly and facilitates integrin-dependent growth factor signaling to support cell growth and survival. Since a bulky glycocalyx is a feature of malignant cells, it is suggested that these features could foster the spread of cancer by mechanically enhancing cell surface receptor function (545).

If the peptide carries a very small glycan, this moiety can contribute novel specificity to recognition (587\u2013591). However larger glycans typically disrupt peptide loading and/or T-cell receptor recognition, and often eliminate it altogether. This explains a common immune escape strategy of enveloped viruses, whose surface glycoproteins tend to be very heavily glycosylated (592\u2013593). Sometimes, such protective glycosylation can become so dense that it generates unique clustered epitopes recognized by specific antibodies, such as that seen on the surface of the HIV virion (507\u2013509, 594). In other instances, one type of glycan can block immune recognition of another, such as the Cryptococcus neoformans yeast cell wall, which is required for virulence (595\u2013596), apparently by protecting the deeper structures of the organism from recognition and attack by the host immune system.",

Beyond their effects on protein structure per se, certain branched glycans can affect a variety of biological functions. Thus, there are reports of regulation of cytokine receptors by modulation of endocytosis rates by the type of glycan structure and branching (605), and N-glycan number and degree of branching can cooperate to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (606) as well as thymocyte positive selection (607). The degree of branching of N-glycans is primarily dependent on the addition of \u03b2-linked GlcNAc residues donated by UDP-GlcNAc. Given that glucosamine and GlcNAc are major metabolic intermediates in most cells, the level of UDP-GlcNAc provides a likely connection between cellular metabolism, cell surface organization and disease (608). In keeping with this concept, the cell surface residency time of glucose transporter 2 is regulated by branching of its N-glycans, and alters insulin secretion as well (609). This provides a connection between diabetes, pancreatic \u03b2 cell glycosylation and glucose transport (610). A different kind of N-glycan branching (so-called bissecting GlcNAc) inhibits growth factor signaling and retards mammary tumor progression (611) and E-cadherin may be a target molecule for this glycan modulating effect (612\u2013613).",

Gagneux adds water and motion to the image, making it even more realistic). But the glycocalyx is also suggested to include self-organizing ordered lattices of glycans and lectins (83, 614\u2013615). An intriguing connection has been established between the glycan branching phenomena mentioned above and the formation of such cell surface lattices involving galectin recognition of polylactosaminoglycans, which tend to be enriched on highly branched glycans (117, 606, 608, 616). The concept is that an ordered lattice forms within the glycocalyx that alters interactions between cell surface molecules, also affecting their rates of clearance from the cell surface by endocytosis. Thus, evolutionary selection is suggested to have modulated the number of glycans of inhibitory versus activating growth factor receptors, such that branching (controlled by UDP-GlcNAc and GlcNAc transferases) can differentially affect their relative ratio on the cell surface, by altering cell surface residence times (606, 608, 616\u2013617). Complexity arises because capping of polylactosaminoglycans by sialic acids can modulate galectin recognition by its presence and or linkage type (618\u2013622).",

In passing, it is worth mentioning that differences in the sulfation and sialylation of the N-glycans expressed on endogenous versus exogenous erythropoietin are used by the Anti-Doping Agency to detect illicit administration, and has led to rescinding of many major sporting trophies (645\u2013646).",

This remarkable system and its numerous ramifications have been well reviewed elsewhere (21, 70, 647\u2013654), and will not be addressed in detail here. Other forms of nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation have since been discovered and characterized functionally in many organisms. For example, oxygen-sensing in diverse protozoa depends on prolyl-4-hydroxylation of the E3(SCF)ubiquitin ligase family subunit Skp1, and modification of the resulting hydroxyproline with a series of sugars. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, O2 availability is rate limiting for hydroxylation of newly synthesized Skp1. Knockout mutants of the Skp1 prolyl hydroxylase and each of the Skp1 glycosyltransferases confirmed that O2-dependent post-translational glycosylation of Skp1 promotes association with F-box proteins and their engagement in functional E3(SCF)Ub ligases, which in turn regulate O2-dependent developmental progression (655\u2013659).",

            "text": "Returning to the extracellular compartment, another classic example is the modulation of IgG effector functions by the structural features of the N-glycans in the IgG-Fc region (660\u2013663). Incomplete galactosylation of these glycans has been associated with chronic inflammatory diseases (664\u2013666), and there are clear-cut effects of IgG-Fc glycan core fucosylation on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (667\u2013671) that are relevant to biotechnology (672\u2013673). Sialylation of a minor fraction of the IgG-Fc N-glycans also appears to convert the IgG molecule into an inhibitor of inflammation, and is thought to underlie the anti-inflammatory properties of therapeutically delivered intravenous immunoglobulin in humans. While many papers have been written about this effect, there is still some controversy about the extent of the effects, and the details of mechanisms in different models and species (674\u2013701). One possible explanation for the confusing results is that the immune responses are subject to \u201chormesis\u201d. This is poorly appreciated but common biological phenomenon wherein low and high doses of the same stimulus can result in opposite biological responses and outcomes (702\u2013705). Regardless of controversies, it is clear that subtle changes in the glycosylation state of Ig-Fc regions of N-glycans can profoundly influence not only circulating half-life, but also the effector function of antibodies (706). Meanwhile, contrary to 40 years of X-ray crystallography suggesting immobility of the Fc-region N-glycan, recent NMR studies suggest that this glycan is actually mobile and dynamic in solution (707). Thus, it is possibly the range of motion of the glycan that is being altered by the various modifications, secondarily affecting interactions with Fc-receptors of various types via an allosteric mechanism (708). Finally, while much of what is stated above refers to IgGs prepared for therapeutic use, it appears that modulation of IgG-Fc glycosylation occurs naturally in vivo, in various inflammatory and infectious conditions (687) although the mechanisms of modulation are largely unknown. More recent evidence suggests that the Fc-region of other Ig classes may also alter effector function (709\u2013710).",

The F-pilus mediated glycan-dependent binding of uropathogenic Escherichia coli accounts for millions of urinary tract infections a year (720\u2013721) and small molecule inhibitors are being explored as therapies or prophylactics (722). With regard to parasites, a well-known example is the merozoite stage of Plasmodium falciparum, which initiates malaria via recognition of densely sialylated glycophorins on target erythrocytes (723\u2013730), with the types of sialic acids presented affecting species specificity (731\u2013733). At a later stage in malaria, heparan sulfate on endothelial cells mediates the binding of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes via the DBL1\u0251 domain of PfEMP1 (734), likely accounting for some of the most serious complications of the disease. Specificity for host glycans also plays a role in the binding of a pathogenic fungus (Candida glabrata) to various target tissues (735).",

Of these the best known is probably influenza hemagglutinin (the \u201cH\u201d in \u201cH1N1\u201d), which plays a key role in the infection process of this highly successful group of viruses. Much has been written about the specificity of the binding of these pathogens in relation to the sialic acid ligand, particularly the specific linkage to the underlying sugar chain, which determines the preference of the virus for avian versus human hosts (739\u2013749). The evolution of the avian influenza viruses towards infecting humans involves selection for a change in binding specificity, which can be replicated experimentally (744). Interestingly, even our closest evolutionary cousins (chimpanzees) do not have a high density of human sialic acid composition or linkage on their airway epithelium (750), explaining the lack of nonhuman primate models and the unlikely choice of the ferret as a model for human influenza\u2013\u2013because it happens to express the human-like linkage on its airway epithelium (751\u2013752), and also because it turns out to, like humans, be missing the nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc (753). There are other examples of even more exquisite sialic acid specificity of viruses, based on the presence of O-acetyl esters at specific positions: while a 4-O-acetyl ester on sialic acid targets is required for mouse hepatitis virus infection (754\u2013756), a 9-O-acetyl ester on the sialic acid side chain is required for the binding of certain other coronaviruses and influenza C and D viruses (624, 757\u2013761). The difference between these two specificities is dictated by only a few key amino acid changes in the viral receptors (762\u2013763).",

Typically, a bacterial glycan-binding B subunit is multimeric and serves to bring the toxic A subunit close to the membrane, whereby the latter then crosses over to mediate its toxic actions in the cytosol (with or without prior endocytosis). Classic examples include cholera toxin, which binds GM1 ganglioside (256, 764), the infamous ricin toxin that binds to terminal \u03b2-linked galactose residues (765\u2013766), and the entero-hemorrhagic E. coli/Shiga verotoxin that recognizes globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer) and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4Cer) glycosphingolipids (767\u2013769). The precise spacing of target ligands can be very important to the optimal binding of the pentameric lectins to the target (770\u2013771). The single oxygen atom difference between the Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc forms of sialic acids can also determine the specificity of toxin binding, such as in the cases of the typhoid (772) and SubAB (773) toxins. In some cases, there is also evidence of dual specificity, e.g., fucosylated blood group structures on glycoproteins may contribute to cholera toxin binding (774), via an independent binding site (775).",

For example, the small intestinal mucus layer is rich in RegIIIgamma, a secreted host antibacterial lectin, which is essential for maintaining partial sterility of a ~50-\u03bcm zone that physically separates the luminal microbes from the intestinal epithelial surface (776). Also, host galectins have been found to have unexpected toxicity towards bacteria via recognition of their surface glycans (777\u2013778). Killing occurs rapidly and independently of complement and is accompanied by disruption of membrane integrity. Galectin-3 may also play an important role in innate immunity against infection and colonization of Helicobacter pylori. (779). Galectin-1 can have dual and opposing effects on virus infection of human endothelial cells (780). In other instances, circulating soluble multimeric (typically pentameric) glycan-binding proteins recognize surface glycans of foreign pathogens but do not directly kill the pathogen. Instead they provide a signpost to attract other active components of the immune system such as complement and macrophages. Examples including collectins like the mannan-binding lectin, and the ficolins (334, 781). Indeed this kind of triggering of innate immune reactions via multivalent recognition of foreign glycans represents some of the most ancient and effective forms of immunity. For example, the hemolymph of horseshoe crabs recognizes invaders through a combinatorial approach, using lectins with different specificities against glycans exposed on pathogens (782), allowing these organisms to survive almost unchanged for >100 million years, without the benefit of adaptive immunity.",

Some mammals also rely on symbiotic microorganisms within their digestive tract to gain energy from plant biomass that is resistant to mammalian digestive enzymes (786). In other instances, the glycosidase acts in a balance with the binding activity of the same pathogen (787). For example, the sialic acid-binding (\u201chemagglutinating\u201d, H) activity of the influenza viruses is balanced by the activity of its sialic acid releasing enzyme (neuraminidase, N), the latter working both to allow the virus to gain access to cell surfaces by cutting through interfering molecules (788\u2013789), and also to allow release from cells after replication (790). The elegant structure-based design of a modified version of the previously known sialidase inhibitor Neu5Ac2en (791) gave rise to the potent and specific inhibitor zanamivir (Relenza) (792\u2013793), and later to the structurally related agent oseltamivir (Tamiflu) (794\u2013795). It is worth noting that oseltamivir is not a glycan, showing how chemical shapes can be designed to mimic glycans. In yet other cases, microbial glycosidases remodel host glycans to generate the optimal receptor for subsequent binding. For example the secreted neuraminidase of Vibrio cholerae removes all but one specific sialic acid residue from host gangliosides, leaving behind the GM1 monosialoganglioside, which is the specific receptor for the B subunit of the AB5 exotoxin secreted by the same organism (796).",

The thick layer of mucin glycans on the surface of epithelial cells lining hollow organs (139, 418, 448\u2013452) also plays a critical role by providing decoy binding sites for pathogens, diverting them from their intended targets on the cells. Of course commensals may take advantage of such mucin binding to remain within their preferred ecological niche (797\u2013800) and to favor dental biofilm development (801). But on the rare occasions when such bacteria accidentally find their way into the bloodstream, these same commensalism-favoring adhesins become virulence factors, mediating interactions with platelets, which act as carriers of the organisms to eventual infection of damaged heart valves (798, 802\u2013807). This is a recurring theme at sites of interspecies interactions, wherein factors favoring routine commensalism turn into potent \u201cvirulence factors\u201d, on the occasions when physical barriers are breached and/or host immunity is compromised.",

Since glycans are often the targets for many infectious agents, intra- and interspecies polymorphisms in the expression of such targets can provide herd immunity, and restrict the spread of disease. As an example the ABO(H) blood group system can affect the spread of a highly infectious noroviruses that selectively binds one blood group structure and not another (808\u2013811). This is likely why not everyone is sick by the time a cruise ship suffering a norovirus epidemic makes it back to port. ABO blood group polymorphisms also appear to affect susceptibility to cholera, as the cholera toxin has a secondary binding site for such glycans (775). The high levels of competitive oligosaccharides in human milk likely provide protection to breast-fed infants against some viruses and toxins (812\u2013814).",

While studies are continuing (846\u2013849), this remains a poorly explored area. Given the very high density of bacteriophages in nature (10 million viruses per milliliter of surface seawater!) (850), there are likely a huge number of such as yet undiscovered viruses with exquisite specificities for diverse glycan structures. Indeed, it is possible that a cognate bacteriophage exists for every variant of every bacterial surface polysaccharide that occurs in nature. Thus bacteriophages are effectively a massive reservoir of glycan-binding and glycan-hydrolyzing proteins still waiting to be exploited for glycan analysis and bacterial diagnostics as well as therapeutics (851), e.g., a potential new source of therapeutic \u201cenzybiotics\u201d (852) or disrupters of biofilms (853). Early steps in this kind of systematic search are promising (854).",

            "text": "In addition to the biophysical effects of attached glycans on nascent glycoprotein folding discussed above, specific recognition of certain glycan residues plays a key role regulating the process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). After the unusual Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol structure of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor for N-glycosylation was first fully defined (855), it turned out to be identical in almost all eukaryotes studied. Conservation of this structure for more than a billion years of evolution strongly suggested that it serves a very important purpose. But while many features of the structure were clearly needed to ensure optimal N-glycan transfer (856\u2013859), variations were possible in some parasites (860\u2013861) and mutant cell lines (235), and the exquisite conservation of the native structure remained largely unexplained. A clue finally emerged when it was discovered that the third glucose residue on N-glycans is repeatedly removed and then put back on again during glycoprotein folding in the ER (862\u2013863). This in turn led to the discovery that this terminal glucose residue is recognized by certain ER chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin (864\u2013868). The key role of this glucosylation/deglucosylation cycle in protein folding is now well established (63, 71, 869\u2013878). However, even after the last glucose residue has been permanently removed, there are further steps of recognition of the oligomannose type N-glycans that have been partially processed by ER mannosidases (879\u2013884). These recognition events are mediated in part by mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domains in several chaperone proteins, as well as additional mannosidase-like proteins and recognition complexes (130, 879, 881\u2013888). Effectively, a byzantine array of glycan-modifying and glycan-recognizing proteins determines the final fate of a glycoprotein molecule in the ER\u2013\u2013whether it will be allowed to go forward into the Golgi pathway towards its final destination, or be consigned for ERAD. And since most proteins that enter the ER are glycosylated, this system has a huge impact in normal and diseased states, as well as on unfolded protein stress responses (883, 889). As mentioned earlier, O-mannosylation and O-fucosylation can also play a role in monitoring the folding of newly synthesized proteins. Proteins that fail to fold are eventually removed from harmful futile protein folding cycles and prepared for disposal, via reverse translocation into the cytosol. There is even a sophisticated cytosolic pathway for removing and recycling the N-glycans from misfolded proteins prior to the action of proteasomes, beginning with the action of a previously mysterious cytosolic Peptide: N-glycanase (890). Notably O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins can also occur cotranslationally, protecting nascent polypeptide chains from premature degradation by decreasing cotranslational ubiquitinylation (891).",

There is now evidence for other lectin-like molecules within the ER-Golgi pathway, which likely modulate the trafficking of specific classes of glycoproteins. For example, the LMAN1 gene product ERGIC-53 in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment is a mannose-selective and calcium-dependent human homolog of leguminous L-type lectins (892) and acts as a critical chaperone for the coagulation factors V and VIII during their biosynthesis in hepatocytes (893) and endothelial cells (894) respectively, also potentially affecting the biosynthesis of some other glycoproteins (895). Other examples are VIPL and VIP36 (896\u2013901). Overall, it is reasonable to predict the existence of more such glycan-recognizing proteins in the ER-Golgi pathway, potentially involved in trafficking and/or chaperone functions.",

A large variety of lectins are known to carry out endocytosis in macrophages and dendritic cells. Such recognition processes may be critical not only for providing antigens to process and present to T cells, but also for clearing away damaged cells or glycoproteins, such as occurs when microbial sialidases enter the circulation during sepsis and cause desialylation of platelets (902\u2013903), or when cancers secrete incompletely glycosylated mucins (512).",

Another well-established example of intercellular signaling is represented by bacterial Nod factors (820) (not to be confused with the NLRs of vertebrate inflammasomes), which communicate signals between rhizobacteria and the roots of their leguminous plant hosts (907\u2013911), initiating the symbiosis that is eventually responsible for the bulk of the natural nitrogen fixation on the planet\u2013\u2013a process key to the survival of many organisms that benefit from the resulting food chain. The chito-oligosaccharides that transmit the signal show structural specificity for organism and host (907\u2013908) and appear to be detected by a specific lectin (911). Transferring this capability into nonlegume crop species is obviously an exciting prospect. However, this may not be easy, since nonlegumes recognize the Nod factor via a mechanism that results in strong suppression of responses (912). In vertebrate systems hyaluronan fragments released during injury can be detected by TLRs, thus triggering host immune responses (467, 913\u2013915).",

The selectin-based system for cell\u2013cell interactions of leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells has also been discussed. The fact that oral fucose feeding results in correction of leukocyte adhesion deficiency-II by restoring selectin ligands provides the genetic proof of concept of this system in humans (385). The role of selectin interactions in a variety of normal and pathological conditions like inflammation and cancer is now understood (309, 916\u2013921), and therapeutic approaches are in evaluation (921\u2013923). One particularly promising therapeutic outcome is based on the finding that selectins interact with sickled red cells and leukocytes in the circulation to facilitate endothelial adhesion and other interactions (924\u2013927) ultimately contributing to vascular occlusion and \u201csickle cell crisis\u201d (928). The effectiveness of the pan-selectin inhibitor GMI-1070 in reducing selectin-mediated cell adhesion and abrogating crisis shows much promise in early clinical trials (922, 929). Another classic example is the role of Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG, Siglec-4) in mediating key interactions between neurons and glia (930\u2013932), a process critical for maintaining the stability of the myelin sheath that insulates axons (933\u2013934).",

Data indicate that this kind of \u201ceat me\u201d signal may even mitigate the lethal coagulopathy of sepsis by clearing away damaged platelets (902\u2013903). There also appears to be a very high-capacity system for clearance of incompletely glycosylated mucins by the liver (512). Such molecules are released in large amounts by cancer cells, but could also potentially appear during damage to otherwise healthy organs. The subset of cancer-derived molecules (e.g., CA125, Sialyl-Tn and CA19-9) that survive such clearance then become useful markers of disease progression (948\u2013951). The value of such markers for early detection remains unclear (952), a problem known to plague many predictive serum markers (953).",

It was recently proposed that glycans could also act as self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) (961), being recognized by intrinsic inhibitory receptors to maintain the baseline nonactivated state of innate immune cells, and to dampen their reactivity following an immune response. A clear example of glycan-based SAMPs has been reported in the form of inhibitory Siglec recognition of cell surface sialoglycans (962\u2013964), which may also provide a mechanism for the host to discriminate between infectious nonself and noninfectious self (965). Recent work (157, 966\u2013968) has also affirmed prior evidence that sialoglycan recognition by factor H can blunt immune responses by inhibiting the alternate pathway of complement activation (966, 969). Siglec-9 recognition of hyaluronan may be another example of a SAMP system (970). Not surprisingly, these very same self-glycans are also common candidates for molecular mimicry by commensals or pathogens that engage these inhibitory receptors (see below).",

These \u201cxeno-autoantigens\u201d are recognized by pre-existing circulating \u201cxeno-autoantibodies\u201d, and the resulting \u201cxenosialitis\u201d is suggested as one mechanism for the epidemiological association between red meat consumption and the exacerbation of some common disease states, such as carcinomas and complications of atherosclerosis (984\u2013985). It would not be surprising if other examples exist. One can imagine for example that bacterial nonulosonic acids or plant monosaccharides that are structurally related to host monosaccharides might get activated to their corresponding nucleotide sugars and then get transferred onto endogenous glycans at a low rate. While the efficiency of such a process would likely be lower than that of Neu5Gc, the resulting immune responses might be even stronger.",

While there is continued controversy about the extent of horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (986), most instances of glycan molecular mimicry by pathogens seem to involve convergent evolution of pre-existing pathogen biosynthetic pathways, or de novo generation of functional genes. Demonstrating the power of natural selection at the host-pathogen interface, Group B Streptococcus polysaccharides (987) display identity to specifics of host glycan structure such as the Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21- (which perfectly matches the structure of N-glycan antennae on many human glycoproteins), and Campylobacter species carry out near-perfect mimicking of complex brain ganglioside glycans (988\u2013989). In the former case, it is evident that this mimicry allows the organism to imitate endogenous SAMPs and down-regulate innate immune responses by engaging the inhibitory Siglecs (962). In the latter instance rare human immune responses against the ganglioside-like structures can even result in serious illness, with the complement-fixing antibodies damaging peripheral nerves (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) (990\u2013991). While Campylobacter sialylation may also modulate immune responses via Siglecs during sporadic contacts with humans (992\u2013995), it is unclear why the organism (which normally lives in the chicken intestine) (996) has evolved this remarkable degree of molecular mimicry of vertebrate ganglioside. Perhaps there are Siglec-like inhibitory pathways in the chicken that have yet to be discovered.?",

In addition to acting as SAMPs recognized by Siglecs or limiting complement activation via factor H recruitment, such terminal sialic acids also serve to mask antibody recognition of underlying structures. The fact that numerous organisms have independently evolved so many different ways to decorate themselves with host-like sialoglycans (1001) speaks to the strong selection pressure for this mimicry.",

This is also exemplified by the widely disparate phenotypes arising from genetic modifications in various steps involved in biosynthesis of the molecule. Thus for example, mice deficient in heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 exhibit defective heparan sulfate biosynthesis, abnormal placentation and late embryonic lethality (1012) and autism-like socio-communicative deficits and stereotypes appear in mice lacking heparan sulfate only in the brain (1013).",

            "text": "With the possible exception of transient bloodstream phase of certain parasites, there appears to be no exception thus far to the \u201crule\u201d that the surfaces of all cells in nature are covered with a dense and complex coating of glycans, which is taxon-, species- and cell-type specific (178). If it had been biologically possible to evolve a living cell devoid of such a coating, such a cell would have no doubt emerged from >3 billion years of evolutionary selection. There is no single best explanation for this ubiquity of cell surface glycans, and several mutually nonexclusive ones can be considered. In addition to providing a physical barrier to protect the plasma membrane, glycans tend to be hydrophilic, often do not have rigid structures, and instead have significant freedom of motion in aqueous solution. These are the optimal properties for a class of molecules that interact at the interface with an aqueous environment. Also, it is difficult for cells coated only with proteins to evolve and escape mechanism from a pathogen that binds to a specific cell surface protein. Most amino acid changes are not usually well tolerated by proteins, impacting folding and/or stability or even rendering the molecule dysfunctional. In contrast, most intrinsic glycan functions are mediated not by a single absolutely required sequence, but by an ensemble of structures, spanning a continuum. Even the apparently \u201clock-and-key\u201d example of Man-6-P recognition of lysosomal enzyme N-glycans discussed earlier actually involves a spectrum of Man-6-P bearing structures with a range of binding properties to two different M6PRs. In other words, many glycan functions are \u201canalog\u201d not \u201cdigital\u201d. Thus, it is easier for a host to escape pathogens by subtly changing glycosylation (i.e., glycans may convey more robustness to the organism) without drastically altering intrinsic functions. Last but not least, a vastly greater number of structural variations can be generated via monosaccharide oligomerization and branching in comparison with nucleic acids or amino acids (1050). This increases the odds of evolutionary selection to escape from a cell surface interacting pathogen or toxin.",

In every instance of apparent lineage-specific loss, a careful phylogenetic analysis is needed to ascertain if the differences are due to gain or loss of a specific gene or pathway and/or due to convergent evolution (or particularly in the case of prokaryotes, horizontal gene transfer). Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, more studies are needed to understand not only the functions of taxon-specific glycans but also the biological significance of their loss in some lineages. Some data suggest that taxon-specific glycan losses may have played a role in protection from parasites like malaria (732, 1055), and even in speciation events, such as the origin of the genus Homo (943).",

Later, misfolded glycoproteins that are returned to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation are first subject to a cytosolic PNGase enzyme that releases free oligosaccharides (890). Such free oligosaccharides are then subject to either further cytosolic catabolism or pumped back into lysosomes for degradation (1056). Even free complex N-glycans bearing sialic acids can also be found in the cytosol (1057). The question arises as to whether such glycans mediate any specific functions in the nucleocytosolic compartment, before they are degraded, such affecting transcription. Meanwhile, free sialyloligosaccharides related to N-glycans have recently been found in serum (1058), and may also have novel functions yet to be discovered.",

However, many examples have emerged wherein well-known glycan-binding proteins are discovered to also bind to unrelated glycan class, sometimes not even obviously similar in structure. In some instances, this is simply because the protein in question has two distinct binding modules, e.g., the L-type lectin mannose receptor can also have a separate R-type lectin module that recognizes sulfated GalNAc residues on pituitary glycoprotein hormones (1059). However, in many other cases, the binding region is shared or very close by. Thus for example, selectins that were originally defined by their binding to sialylated fucosylated glycans can bind quite well to certain subsets of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (1060\u20131061). Likewise, Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 can bind both to polysialic acid and heparan sulfate (1025), and Siglec-9 binds both sialic acids and hyaluronan (970). Recently, it has even been shown that some galectins bind efficiently to as yet undefined motifs on bacterial surfaces (777) as well as to some sulfated glycosaminoglycans (1062), in a manner still inhibitable by its canonical ligand lactose. In most such instances, it is unclear what the shared glycan motif is. Given great dissimilarities in primary structure, cross-recognition perhaps arises from \u201cclustered patch\u201d combinations (146, 302) of components of more than one monosaccharide, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfate, acetyl groups, etc. Given existing difficulties in efficiently incorporating even small, defined cognate ligands into the binding pockets of crystal structures of glycan-binding proteins, it will be challenging to compare such disparate ligands and define the shared recognition components. Regardless, it is clear biological functions of a glycan-binding protein should not be assumed to be mediated by the canonical glycan ligand class that originally defined the name of the protein.",

However, the serendipitous mechanism by which many of them have been discovered suggests that a systematic approach to future discovery may be useful. Consider the case of sialic acid-binding proteins. As late as the 1970s, it was thought that sialic acids were just biological masks, and that there were no binding proteins intrinsic to the organism synthesizing them. Notably of the few sialic acid-binding proteins reported since then, i.e., Factor H (1067\u20131068), Selectins (286), Siglecs (324\u2013325), PILRs (1069) and PECAM-1 (1070\u20131071), almost all were discovered serendipitously to recognize sialic acid, based on an unexpected loss of a functional readout upon sialidase treatment. Given that sialic acids have been present on the glycocalyx of the Deuterostome lineage of animals for more than 500 million years, it would not be surprising if there are many more as yet undiscovered sialic acid-binding properties of other already known proteins. The same is likely to be true for other classes of glycans, especially terminal and exposed structures. On the other hand, given relatively low single-site-binding affinities, a systematic approach to discovering such proteins may not be trivial. Sialoglycan array studies recently revealed the sialic acid-binding properties of M-ficolin (1072). On a cautionary note, the very high density of targets in glycan arrays might also detect binding specificities that may not exist in nature.",

While there can be a high degree of recognition specificity, the single-site affinity is typically poor. Various reasons are discussed, and this general observation underscores the frequent need for multivalent avidity, in order to generate effective biological functions or effective experimental probes (1073). Of course, multivalency is the general state of most biology at the cell surface as nothing is present in only one copy. Thus effective affinity in nature is actually quite high. Regardless, in reality most glycans in aqueous solution are in constant motion and constitute an ensemble of many different shapes generated by many mobile bond angles, which are constantly interchanging (1074\u20131075). In order for the more rigid and ordered binding pockets of glycan-binding proteins to bind such \u201cshape-shifting\u201d glycans, they must actually \u201ctrap\u201d one of the numerous possible solution conformations of the cognate glycan into the pocket, where the immobilized glycan can be seen in a crystal structure. Strictly speaking then the effective concentration of the true cognate glycan is far lower than that of the total glycan concentration, likely in the nanomolar range. Exceptions may arise when the glycan targets are restricted in their motion, forming \u201cclustered saccharide patches\u201d, such as on the surface of densely glycosylated cells, mucins or viruses (146, 544).",

However, in other instances the ligand is a specific glycoform of a particular glycoprotein, which is difficult to define in terms of a cognate glycan sequence. This results in the inadvertently erroneous statements, implying that the polypeptide is the ligand, e.g., \u201cPSGL-1 is the ligand for P-selectin\u201d (1076); or \u201cCD24 is the ligand for Siglec-10\u201d (965) (PSGL-1 and CD24 are actually the designated names of the core polypeptides). It also leads to incorrect assumptions, e.g., that a glycoform of CD24 must automatically be the ligand for mouse Siglec-G, the mouse ortholog of human Siglec-10 (965). In these and many other such instances, the ligand is actually a specific glycoform of the named polypeptide, and is only synthesized by certain cell types with the right kind of glycosylation machinery, i.e., the same carrier polypeptide does not serve as a ligand in other situations. In the case of a CD44 glycoform from hematopoietic stem cells that is a specific ligand for E- and L-selectin (1077\u20131078), the authors reasonably chose to rename the molecule altogether as HCELL (hematopoietic cell E- and L-selectin ligand) (921). However, this leaves out the useful information that the underlying polypeptide is CD44. A compromise may be to list the name of the polypeptide and use the superscript to indicate that it is a specific glycoform that generated the ligand in question, e.g., CD44HCELL or HCELLCD44. As with most nomenclature issues, it may be hard to find consensus on this matter. Suffice it to say that there is need for a resolution, to make it easier to understand the literature on ligands for glycan-binding proteins.",

This resulted in a peculiar distortion of the bioscience community, in which an entire generation of biologists (beginning in the 1980s) has been trained without much knowledge or appreciation about the structure, biosynthesis and roles of glycans in nature (1080). The relative lack of interest in glycans can also be partly traced to the early lack of understanding of their biological roles. So, why was it so difficult to elucidate biological roles of glycans? Some of the reasons are obvious, such as the technical difficulties in detection, analysis and manipulation in biological systems. Some additional considerations are outlined in Figure 6. Because of the information embedded in the template-driven biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, it has been relatively easy to go from one to the other, using sophisticated yet facile experimental methods, and via bioinformatic predictions. Also as shown in the upper panel of Figure 6, the path to defining a specific function as being mediated by a specific protein has been relatively straightforward. In striking contrast the field of glycosciences originated in \u201cdescriptive\u201d carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry and remained in these domains for a long time. New glycans were discovered by a variety of means (such as those shown in lower panel of Figure 6) and their structure and biosynthesis were elucidated. Studies of changes in development and disease were almost guaranteed to show interesting findings, justifying further funding and research. It was also necessary to decipher the biosynthetic enzymes and mechanisms involved in generating each glycan. Thus there was plenty of interesting work to do, other than take on the most difficult task of elucidating function. Also, many of the functions of glycans tend to be \u201canalog\u201d and not \u201cdigital\u201d, and many glycans have more than one disparate function. Finally, the rapid evolution of glycans has generated a lot of species-specific differences, making it difficult to find common themes applicable to all major model systems studies in biology. With the power of modern glycomics and the move to integrate glycosylation data into multiomic studies, it now possible to get past these difficulties and study the functions of glycans like never before. But we still then need to define the glycome.\n",

Daunting and sophisticated as it is, most of what is called glycomics in 2016 still amounts to generating a \u201cparts list\u201d of all the glycans one can find in a given cell type or tissue at a particular point in time and space, i.e., similar to a peptide map of a mixture of proteins. In addition, current methods partially or completely destroy or miss labile modifications like acetylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, lactylation, pyruvylation, etc. More efforts are needed to discover all the glycan attachment sites on proteins and lipids, in a cell type in question (1089). Eventually, we need not only to define all of the above, but also to understand and visualize the conformation and organization of glycans on individual cell types and surfaces, in the form of \u201cclustered saccharide patches\u201d (146, 302), or glycosynapses (87). In the final analysis, full understanding of the biology of glycans will require this comprehensive type of view for which analytical techniques are yet to be defined. But great advances are being made by many investigators in all of the above levels of glycomics, and the future looks bright. Moreover, we can take advantage of the fact that pathogens and commensals have already spent million of years adapting to interact with the glycans of their hosts, and have already evolved highly specific binding proteins for recognition. Thus as mentioned earlier, an entire array of probes for defining the glycome is already available in nature, waiting to be isolated, characterized and eventually converted into practical tools, if necessary with further mutations. Initial steps in this direction are also very promising (1090).",

But it has recently become evident that O-GlcNAc can modify RNA polymerase II, histones, histone deacetylase complexes and members of the Polycomb and Trithorax groups (1091\u20131092). Thus, it is suggested that O-GlcNAc cycling serves as a mechanism linking nutrient availability to chromatin organization, histone modification and epigenetics (711). It remains to be seen if such epigenetic effects can mediate intergenerational transfer, in a manner similar to other epigenetic marks. There are also no clear-cut examples of glycans acting as enzymes [if one excludes RNA from being considered as a polysaccharide, and intramolecular self-cleavage of PolySia (1093) as a chemical anomaly].",

In this regard, the 2012 US National Academies/National Research Council report on the future of glycoscience concluded by recommending: \u201c\u2026transforming Glycoscience from a field dominated by specialists to a widely studied and integrated discipline, which could lead to a more complete understanding of glycans and help solve key challenges in diverse fields\u201d, and emphasized the need to invest in education and technology development (1095). A more recent NIH working group report further emphasizes the need for training in Glycoscience (1080).",

            "text": "Many functions of glycans will continue to be discovered by the conventional processes of scientific investigation that will serendipitously come upon such functions. However, there are several potential systematic approaches to uncovering these functions that are depicted in Figure 7. Each approach has its pros and cons, which are discussed in detail elsewhere (160). Also not fully shown in this figure are newer methods taking advantage of the power of chemoenzymatic synthesis (62, 127, 158) and introduction of modified sugars with bioorthogonal reporter groups into biological systems (111). As with any biological questions, there are pros and cons of studying isolated cells versus intact organisms. And one must always ask how species- or taxon-specific a given function might be. All of approaches depicted in Figure 7 are rendered difficult in the case of glycan types that have numerous nonoverlapping functions in the same biological system. As the late Philip Majerus once put it, trying to decipher the roles of such molecules by preventing their synthesis or by destroying them after the fact is like \u201csifting through the ashes to find out how dynamite works\u201d. Of course this problem is not unique to glycans. Complexity and pleiotropy are inherent in all of biology, and the same could be said of other post-translational modifications.\n",

The fact that such a review on roles of glycans was necessary in 1993 indicates how far behind we were in our understanding of their biology. As this update after 23 years shows, we have come a very long way, and one author now can barely scratch the surface of the topic in a single review. The time has come for the biology of glycans to be \u201cmainstreamed\u201d with that of the other major macromolecules that are universal to all life forms. But this requires a concerted effort on the part of all biologists and naturalists, to fully integrate the roles of glycans into their thinking about living systems.

However, in contrast to the genetic code, the degree of chemical complexity and evolutionary diversification of glycans amongst various taxa is the greatest. The likely reasons for this difference are discussed in the text, and can help explain the still rather limited knowledge base regarding this class of molecules. But we now know that dense and complex glycosylation is universal to all living cells and even most viruses. Evidently, more than 3 billion years of evolution has failed to generate a free-living cell devoid of glycosylation. Thus, one can conclude that glycosylation is as essential to life as a genetic code. Figure modified from ref. 178 and used with permission from Varki A. 2011a.

Each arrowed circle represents a potential evolutionary vicious cycle, driven by a Red Queen effect, in which hosts are constantly trying to evade the more rapidly evolving pathogens that infect them. Hosts require glycans for critical cellular functions but must constantly change them to evade glycan-binding pathogens, and yet do so without impairing their own fitness. Hosts also produce soluble glycans such as mucins, which act as decoys to divert pathogens from cell surfaces; but pathogens are constantly adjusting to these defenses. Hosts recognize pathogen-specific glycans as markers of \u201cnon-self,\u201d but pathogens can modify their glycans to more closely mimic host glycans. There are also possible secondary Red Queen effects involving host glycan-binding proteins that recognize \u201cself\u201d. In each of these cycles, hosts with altered glycans that can still carry out adequate cellular functions are most likely to survive. Reproduced with permission from Varki A. 2006.

            "text": "Fig. 5.: Evolutionary conflicts between alleles and individuals. For single allele-single individual, single alleles conflict with themselves when their positive effects in one context cause negative effects in another. Some examples are here. Selectins on epithelial cells bind glycans on leukocytes and guide them to sites of inflammation, but this can also be exploited by cancer cells. Regulatory or functional changes that separate conflicting tasks are expected to evolve in response. For single allele-multiple individuals, conflicts can extend across individuals that share an allele. Females that lack Neu5Gc raise antibodies against it. Males that lack Neu5Gc have higher rates of fertilization, and females have lower rates. Individual-specific regulation could resolve these conflicts. For multiple genes-single individual, selfish alleles can bias reproduction in their favor at the cost of individual reproduction, causing conflict with other genes in the genome. Mutant alleles that favor heterozygotes are passed more often than expected but increase the risk of congenital disorders of glycosylation. Other genes are selected to suppress the selfish allele, often by modification of chromosomal recombination and linkage. For multiple genes-multiple individuals, molecular markers of self cause cells to direct benefits toward identical genetic relatives, but they can be exploited by pathogen mimics. Co-evolution is a common outcome, as hosts develop more reliable markers of self, and pathogens develop more effective molecular mimics.
