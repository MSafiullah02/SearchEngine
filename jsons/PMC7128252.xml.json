The challenges posed by the outbreaks of BSE, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV, Ebola and Hendra virus, pandemic H1N1 influenza and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, illustrate the importance of ongoing animal and human health surveillance. We need to maintain this surveillance not just locally but also globally if new threats are to be detected quickly and their spread limited. The \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 out there, such as the recently identified Schmallenberg virus (SBV), perhaps present the greatest challenge, requiring a system that can identify truly unusual events and then respond with appropriate investigation and action.",

Subsequent threat characterisation and risk assessment are also central to facilitating a sufficient, proportionate response. In this issue of The Veterinary Journal, Dr. Rachael Tarlinton and colleagues at The Nottingham School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, provide a timely and comprehensive review of the available science that informs the threat posed by the emergence of SBV to UK and mainland European livestock (Tarlinton et al., 2012). Their paper highlights a number of issues and challenges that merit discussion and comment.",

This approach requires supportive effective analysis, as well as communication and \u2018escalation\u2019 routes to share information. The EU response to SBV has highlighted the benefits of working collaboratively: the speed and openness with which knowledge was shared by Germany and The Netherlands enabled the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), working with the Scottish Agricultural Colleges (SAC), in the UK to raise awareness of the spreading infection, identify suspect cases and confirm the disease. This collaboration is continuing through knowledge-sharing coordinated through the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and through joint EU and nationally funded research projects, drawing together a wealth of scientific knowledge and resources to target knowledge gaps. This approach will develop our shared understanding of SBV and provide reliable evidence to assure our trading partners as perhaps the greatest financial consequence of this disease is the negative impact of disproportionate trade restrictions.",

            "text": "It is often suggested that climate change is responsible for the emergence of new diseases in Europe such as SBV and bluetongue virus infection. However, there are also equally important links to both the indirect effects of climate (e.g. social and economic) and \u2018non-climate\u2019 (livestock type and density) changes. Factors such as international transport are likely to have increased the frequency with which vector-borne diseases are introduced to areas beyond their previously recognised distribution. Our intention is to research further the risk pathways and vulnerabilities that enable these new infections to arise as threats to UK livestock. Our experience in the UK, supported by EFSA\u2019s recent report which collates SBV data from all affected EU member states, is that SBV is a \u2018low impact\u2019 disease affecting only 0.3% of all ruminant livestock premises across affected EU Member States (based on data as of 25th July 2012), a prevalence that we believe does not justify such rigorous trade and other restrictions.",

Good data on disease distribution and impact are important to enable farmers to make sound economic decisions based on their particular circumstances. Working in partnership internationally and locally improves our disease vigilance in a constantly changing environment and is paramount to the function of disease early-warning systems. Disease outbreaks such as SBV infection are a global issue and disease reporting through the OIE, WHO and FAO mechanisms is now collated through the Global Early Warning System\n1 which assists in predicting, preventing and controlling disease as the basis of a \u2018one health\u2019 approach to health risks at the animal\u2013human\u2013ecosystem interface.",
