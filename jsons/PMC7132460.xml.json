An alternative respiratory virus infection was diagnosed in half (50.3%) of the cases, including rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B, which were the most frequently detected. They found that peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and during other periods of increased national awareness.13 The absence of any confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases highlights the relevance and utility of the current study, but also highlights the need to encourage such pilgrims to increase their uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine, as advised by one of their dedicated travel advice websites.14\n",

However, this is dependent on the local laboratory results being as reliable. Outside of the Hajj season our hospital sees patients returning from MERS-CoV endemic areas far less frequently. Ensuring that local results are valid would therefore require the local laboratory to regularly undergo quality assurance processes, which would slightly negate the cost-benefits of earlier MERS-CoV exclusion. In addition, the shelf-life of any commercial kit will also impact on the final overall costs of running this MERS-CoV testing service in-house. Unused, outdated test kits would need to be discarded and replaced to cope with any traveller returning sporadically throughout the years from a MERS-CoV-endemic area, with a clinical presentation that would make them eligible for MERS-CoV testing.",
