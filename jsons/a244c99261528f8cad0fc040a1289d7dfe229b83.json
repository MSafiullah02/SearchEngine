Recently, ongoing viral epidemic due to coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affected mainland China that now threatened to spread to populations in most countries of the world. In spite of this, there is currently no antiviral drug/ vaccine available against coronavirus infection, COVID-19. In the present study, computer-aided drug design-based screening to find out promising inhibitors against the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leads to infection, COVID-19. The lead therapeutic molecule was investigated through docking and molecular dynamics simulations. In this, binding affinity of noscapines(23B)-protease of SARS-CoV-2 complex was evaluated through MD simulations at different temperatures. Our research group has established that noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers; however, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and cough-suppressant. This study suggests for the first time that noscapine exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral protein synthesis.",

The infection called COVID-19, is caused by unused endemic crown infection (SARS-CoV-2), is oddand appallingly particular. A later consider concluded that individuals with sort A blood gather may have a better chance of contracting this modern crown infection than individuals with sort O do. A few individuals tainted with the SARS-COV-2 infection feel alright, whereas othersindeed those who are sound and moderately youthfulget exceptionally ill. The COVID-19 widespread seem have tainted 90% of the world populace and slaughtered more than 40.6 million individuals in the event that no moderation measures were put in place to combat it by the individual states all inclusive (Agarwal et al., 2020; Ai et al., 2020; Arshad Ali et al., 2020) .

In joined together United States of America, more than 5,87,155 cases tainted by COVID-19 have been affirmed, and number is still rising. As the COVID-19 flare-up quickly advances, inquire about work to create an immunization and to test antivirals and other therapeutics proceeds in parallel to other measures (Abbad et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2020; Boldog et al., 2020; De Salazar et al., 2020) . At present, there are no effective drugs available for control of coronaviruses infection causes COVID-19. Currently, researchers are working for development of therapeutic drugs to treat infections from coronavirus and control death cases throughout the world. The three dimensional structure of the protease of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19 in complex with N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7) is available on RCSB protein databank (Alfaro et al., 2019; Burley et al., 2018; Daoui et al., 2019) .

The authors screened designed noscapine and its derivatives against the protease of SARS-CoV-2. In this, the target protease of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19 (PDB id -6LU7) was used to consider in screening protocol (Al-Johani et al., 2017; Chandra et al., 2020; Duan & Zhu, 2020) . Screening of designed library was done through iGEMDOCK and then screen the hit molecules based on bioactive score and 'Lipinski's Rule of Five' from the SwissADME and Molinspiration, web servers (Aaboud & ATLAS Collaboration, 2017; Hsu et al., 2011) . Based on screening, top hit molecule was taken for molecular docking and MD Simulations. Through this, the binding affinity or change in binding free energy of newly formed drug-target complex was determined by simulations method and deviations measured on increasing temperature (Aaboud et al., 2018; Adasme-Carreno et al., 2014; Athir et al., 2019; Goodsell et al., 2020) . Herein, MM-GBSA method was to calculate the change in enthalpy and the change in free energy for the formation of complex, number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) are determined to study the binding of the hit molecule with the protease of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19. A detailed study will provide an understanding to the design of antiviral molecules to inhibit protease of SARS-CoV-2 of COVID-19.",

Moreover, MET49 forms p-sulfur interaction and MET165 also forms a p-alkyl interaction with aromatic ring of the molecules. Other interactions are marked with blue dotted lines in the form of van der Waals interactions and p-donor hydrogen bonds. Here, three residues of backbones participates in the hydrogen bonding (Agarwal et al., 2015; Alamri and Alamri, 2019; Ali & Shar, 2019; Scott & Ron, 2018) . The hit molecule (CMPD23B) apart from forming the hydrogen bonds binds in the hydrogen accepter favorable, hydrogen donor favorable region, various stacking occurs in electrostatic favorable regions and van der Waals interactions in the region of steric favorable with protease of coronavirus as in Figure 5(a-d) .",

In order to measured structural stability of the newly formed complex and difference of the stabilities in the protease of corona virus with and without molecule (Do et al., 2018) . In MD simulations, authors have calculated the RMSD values of the backbone atoms relative to the complex structure through MD simulations as a function of time in Figure 6 . It was seen that the complex of CMPD23B is stable til 83 ns time scale. For the complex system with 23B molecules, the average value of RMSD in ff14SB force field is 0.89 to 2.81 \u00c5 observed at 100 ns time scale. While the apo system without 23B molecules, the RMSD value with same field is 0.86 to 3.87 observed at 100 ns scale. This showed that the trajectories of the MD simulations for the drug-target complex were more stable before 83 ns, so it was to do the HBs calculation and free energy decomposition based on the snapshots extracted for 100 ns. Further, the detailed analysis of newly formed drug-target complex through root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) versus the residue number of protease of coronavirus for COVID-19 for top hit molecule is represented in Figure 7 . It was observed that the complex of protease of coronavirus with 23B possess less fluctuations and indicates the interaction mode of the 23B with residues of protease of coronavirus for COVID-19. Moreover, the residues of binding site regions are HIE163, SER147, MET49, GLY143, ASN142, HIE164, SER144, HIE41, MET165 and CYS145 had showed a rigid behaviour with hit molecules. In short analysis, the RMSF plot indicates structural stability drug-target complex system is more stable under the influence of ff14SB force field than native protease of coronavirus for COVID-19.",

The temperature for the MD simulations was increased to 400 K from 300 K with an interval of 25 K. Different trajectories were drawn to study the impact of temperature . RMSD can be used to understand the stability of the complex formed between the protease of coronavirus for COVID-19 and 23B. Various thermodynamic parameters were calculated at different temperatures with filtration. Through Figure 10 , it can be easily understand that the fluctuation is very large at 400 K as well go above 8 \u00d0, therefore, it is unacceptable. So, the theremodynamic parameters at 400 K are not calculated. RMSF trajectories provide lots of information regarding the stability of the complex. High fluctuations in the plot indicate more flexibility as well the more of unstable bonds. On other side, low value or less fluctuation indicate wellstructured regions in the complex means less distortion. RMSF plot indicate that minimum fluctuation or less distortion in protease of coronavirus is observed on binding with 23B as in Figure 11 .",
