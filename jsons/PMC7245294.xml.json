His troponin was negative and brain natriuretic peptide was within the normal range. Electrolytes were grossly normal. Chest radiographs showed bilateral patchy airspace opacities. The patient was started on treatment for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Initial QTc on electrocardiogram (ECG) was 422 msec (Figure 1\n). However, he rapidly decompensated requiring intubation, followed by cardiac arrest from pulseless electrical activity from hypoxia. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) occurred after 4 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using 2 doses of 1mg epinephrine. Afterwards, he required hemodynamic support with norepinephrine and epinephrine infusions and was maintained on propofol and dexmedetomidine infusions for sedation.

Multiple gene mutations have been identified, but the most common is in the SCN5A gene encoding for the cardiac sodium channel, leading to a decrease in sodium current.4 Stronger expression of the transient outward potassium current, Ito in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) epicardium renders the epicardium more susceptible to the reduced depolarization force. In one postulated arrhythmic mechanism, the loss of action potential dome in the (RVOT) epicardium leads to dispersion of repolarization across the ventricular wall and creates a vulnerable window for phase 2 reentry and an extrasystole to initiate VT/VF.5 Another potential arrhythmic mechanism suggests that localized conduction slowing in the RVOT can cause a membrane potential gradient with the right ventricle, and triggers for VT/VF can originate from the border zone between early and delayed depolarization.5\n",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of transient unmasking of BrS with associated PMVT in a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2. The patient likely had incomplete penetrance of a Brugada genotype, and a high fever alone was not able to elicit the characteristic Brugada ECG pattern, as evidenced by the initial normal ECG taken when the temperature was 39.9oC. However, the combination of high fevers and bradycardia was able to elicit Brugada ECG changes and PMVT. With resolution of bradycardia after CPR, defibrillation and epinephrine administration, the Brugada ECG changes completely resolved. The most likely cause of bradycardia was the use of dexmedetomidine, a centrally acting alpha-2 agonist commonly used in intubated patients as a sedative and analgesic, but observed to induce bradycardia in up to 42% of patients.10 The bradycardia may be due to a combination of baroreflex-mediated reduction in heart rate, centrally mediated reduced sympathetic tone, and increased vagal tone.11 Propofol may have contributed, as it has been associated with malignant arrhythmias in BrS.12 Conflictingly, more recent studies have demonstrated safe use of propofol in patients with BrS.13 It is unlikely that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin contributed. Neither drug has been described to exacerbate BrS and QTc was normal on all ECGs. However, interestingly, an in vitro study found that acute exposure to azithromycin resulted in transient reduction in peak SCN5A currents.14\n",
