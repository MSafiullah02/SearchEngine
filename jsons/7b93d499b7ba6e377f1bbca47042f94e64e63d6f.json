EV-D68, one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses, is acid-labile and biologically similar to human rhinoviruses (HRV) (originally classified as HRV87). However, there is no approved preventive or therapeutic measure against EV-D68, HRV, or other enteroviruses. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of series of dipeptidyl compounds against EV-D68 and HRV strains, and demonstrated that several peptidyl aldehyde and a-ketoamide peptidyl compounds are potent inhibitors of EV-D68 and HRV strains with high in-vitro therapeutic indices (>1000). One of the a-ketoamide compounds is shown to have favorable pharmacokinetics profiles, including a favorable oral bioavailability in rats.

The genus Enterovirus is divided into 10 established and 2 proposed species, and among them, at least 7 species infect humans which includes human rhinovirus (HRV) (AeC) and human enteroviruses (AeD) that include enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), and coxsackievirus A and B (CVA and CVB) (Knowles et al., 2012) . Viruses in the Enterovirus genus affect millions of people worldwide and cause a wide spectrum of diseases from asymptomatic or mild illnesses to severe illnesses (Tapparel et al., 2012) . Although poliovirus (PV) has been nearly eradicated by immunization, non-polio enteroviruses account for more than 85%~9 5% of aseptic meningitis cases where a specific viral pathogen is identified (Connolly and Hammer, 1990; Sawyer and Rotbart, 2004) . EV-D68, originally classified as human rhinovirus (HRV) 87, was first identified in California in 1962, and is biologically more similar to HRV for its acid-lability and the respiratory track as the target tissue than other enteroviruses (Schieble et al., 1967; Tokarz et al., 2012) . EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, which includes fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, body/muscle aches, wheezing and difficulty breathing at all ages, but infants, children and teenagers are particularly susceptible to severe symptoms. EV-D68 infection causes particularly severe infections in children with asthma or other existing respiratory illnesses. Since its first report in 1962, few outbreaks of EV-D68 had occurred. However, several outbreaks of EV-D68 have been reported in the last 3e4 years in Europe, Asia and North America.

The replication cycle of enterovirus is initiated by the attachment of a virus particle to a specific receptor on the host cell surface. An example of attachment inhibitors include Pleconaril that binds to a hydrophobic pocket within enterovirus VP1, a major capsid protein, and consequently prevents viral attachment and uncoating. Recent report demonstrated that Pleconaril also inhibited the replication of EV-D68 by binding to the hydrophobic pocket of VP1 (Liu et al., 2015) . Pleconaril failed to get FDA approval for use in adults for potential adverse effects but there are several other entry inhibitors such as Pocapavir and Vapendavir that are being evaluated for their efficacy for neonatal sepsis associated with enterovirus infection (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00031512). Inhibitors of replicases, such as RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase inhibitors, have been reported, but the viral 2A or 3Cpro has been more actively used as a target for inhibition (De Palma et al., 2008b) .

In this study, we have conducted a structure-activity relationship study using the newly generated dipeptidyl derivatives against EV-D68 and HRVs to compare their relative structural requirements for inhibition and determine the potency of the derivatives against these important pathogens. Compound 1, a prototype dipeptidyl aldehyde, was previously reported to have anti-HRV activity and was used as a template for structural modification for these new derivatives. Based on the enzyme and cell culture assays, there was no significant difference in the activity of the compounds against 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs, which suggests that the structural requirements for blockage of 3Cpro is similar for EV-D68 or HRVs, although the amino acid homology between 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRVs is about 50%. This observation may be explained by the overall structural similarity of 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRVs and the striking similarity in the topography of their active sites determined by X-ray crystallographic studies (Lu et al., 2011) . The 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRVs have similar substrate specificity of a near absolute requirement for Gln residue at P1 and a hydrophobic residue (Leu, Phe) at P2 (Fig. 1) . Our structure-activity relationship study also showed that the interchange of Leu and Phe at the P2 position (R1) did not lead to a marked change in activity against 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs. However, the presence of Cha at the P1 position yielded better activity against EV-D68 and HRVs, compared to Leu and Phe. The activity of the compounds did not change upon replacement of hydrogen ion with m-Cl at R2 (cap), suggesting that the presence of the chlorine atom ion at the meta position does not contribute to the binding by interacting with the 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs. In our previous study, the meta-chlorine substituent was found to significantly improve the efficacy as compared to the inhibitor having an unsubstituted phenyl ring against caliciviruses in 3CLpro enzyme and cell based assays (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015) . Interestingly, the a-ketoamide compounds were consistently more potent than their aldehyde counterparts against EV-D68 and HRVs in both enzyme and cell-based assays and the most potent compounds for both EV-D68 and HRV14 were a-ketoamide compounds with Cha at R1 and a benzene cap with or without m-Cl (R2), compound 6 and 10.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1182, "end": 1199, "text": "(Lu et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2210, "text": "(Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1362, "end": 1370, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Table 4"}, {"text": "Previously we have reported that a-ketoamides compounds were less effective than their aldehyde counterparts against 3CLpro of caliciviruses and coronarviruses Tiew et al., 2011) .

It was developed as a nasal spray, however, further development was stopped after phase II clinical trials. Another irreversible 3Cpro inhibitor, compound 1 entered clinical trials. Compound 1 was found to be highly effective against HRV strains with EC 50 < 100 nM and related enteroviruses and, more importantly, it was orally available (Patick et al., 2005) , but it was also dropped during phase 1 clinical trial.

The duration of compound 10 in the rat plasma above the EC 90 values for HRV1B or HRV51 following an oral dose of compound 10 mg/kg is calculated to be much shorter than that for EV-D68 due to the lower antiviral activity of compound 10 against HRV1B or HRV51 (about 2-fold) compared to EV-D68 in cell culture.
