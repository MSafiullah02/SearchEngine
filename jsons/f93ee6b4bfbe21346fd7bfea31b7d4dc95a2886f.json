Some RNP granules form, in part, through formation of intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. In vitro, such trans RNA condensation occurs readily, suggesting that cells require mechanisms to modulate RNA-based condensation. Herein, we assess mechanisms of RNA condensation and how cells modulate this phenomenon. We propose that cells control RNA condensation through ATP-dependent processes, static RNA buffering, and dynamic post-translational mechanisms. Moreover, perturbations in these mechanisms can be involved in disease. This reveals multiple cellular mechanisms of kinetic and thermodynamic control to maintain the proper distribution of RNA molecules between dispersed and condensed forms. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Ribonucleoprotein granules are built via a summation of multivalent interactions Eukaryotic cells contain a variety of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules (see Glossary). RNP granules are large non-membrane bound assemblies of RNA and protein and exist in the nucleus and the cytosol. Examples of RNP granules include the nucleolus (site of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis), stress granules (SGs; which form from untranslating RNAs [1]), and neuronal granules (which are important for transport and translation of synaptic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and synaptic plasticity [2]).",

For instance, higher salt concentrations screen phosphate Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 backbone repulsion interactions and crowding agents strengthen the excluded volume effect to promote trans RNA-RNA interactions [15] . Thus, increasing salt or crowding facilitates increased RNA condensation in vitro.

For example, several nuclear RNP granules, such as histone locus bodies and paraspeckles, form at sites of high transcription of particular RNAs, where local RNA concentrations are elevated (reviewed in [29]). Similarly, the formation of SGs and PBs depend on the cytosolic concentration of untranslating RNAs [30-31]. Increasing the pool of untranslating mRNA by decreasing translation initiation or inhibiting RNA degradation increases SG or PB, respectively [32-34]. Moreover, creating a high local concentration of RNA by injection or transfection promotes SG formation [35-36]. Conversely, decreasing the untranslating mRNA concentration by trapping them on polysomes, or by widespread mRNA degradation, inhibits SG formation [30, 37-40]. Additional evidence that RNA-RNA interactions can promote RNP granule assembly comes from multiple correlations between RNA condensation in vitro and RNP granule formation in cells. First, protein-free yeast total RNA condensation largely recapitulates the yeast SG transcriptome [15]. Second, RNAs that are prone to self-assembly as G-quadruplexes seed SG-like foci in both lysates and Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 cells [26].

This provides an explanation for why RNAs, which are generally much bigger than proteins and would be expected to have multiple interactions with other components of RNP granules, generally display slower dynamics in RNP granules and in vitro condensates than proteins (in vitro: [15] [16] [61] [62] [63] [64] ; in vivo: Table 1 and references therein, [45, 65-67]). Strikingly, mRNPs that are centrally located in RNP granules can be rigidly positioned and very static in the granule, consistent with these RNPs having many trapping interactions [65].

In cells, this is observed in the relative differences of exchange rate, as assessed by (Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) FRAP, for many RNP granule components (Table 1) . This suggests that for many components of RNP granules, their exchange rate represents their off-rate from RNA. Thus, appending an additional RNA binding domain to G3BP reduces its dynamics in SGs [39]. The trend that higher numbers of RNA binding domains reduce G3BP dynamics is preserved when the G3BP RNA binding domain is instead replaced by varying numbers of KH or Zn finger RNA binding domains [39].

For example, ADAR-mediated adenine-to-inosine editing of RNAs destabilizes duplexes and thereby could limit the formation of dsRNAs within cells [69] .

Thermodynamic RNA decondensers are generally abundant RNA chaperones, which, when overexpressed, deter RNP granule formation (Table 1) . For example, overexpression of YB-1 or HuR limits the formation of SGs in response to arsenite treatment [35]. Since these are high affinity RBPs, when they are bound to mRNAs in RNP granules, they exhibit slow rates of exchange and have low mobile fractions in granules. Several common SG-associated RBPs demonstrate these properties ( Table   Journal Pre-proof 1 acting as a competitive inhibitor for wild-type TIA-1 interactions promoting the kinetic condensation of RNA.

            "text": "In a second manner, kinetic RNA decondensers, such as some DEAD-box proteins, can act to lower the activation energy barriers between folded and unfolded RNA conformations and decrease the valency of RNAs by resolving trans interactions and/or promoting cis RNA refolding ( Figure 2B ). For example, the translation initiation factor eIF4A functions to limit RNA condensation both in vitro and in cells [16] . In this mechanism, eIF4A and other related proteins, such as DDX19A/DBP5 [16, 39, 72] , lower the activation energies between folded RNA and unfolded RNA secondary structure through ATPdependent RNA binding, which disrupts several nucleotides in the structured RNA. By decreasing the stability of RNA-RNA interactions, this increases the rate at which the given RNA can unfold or undergo conformational transitions. In the absence of ATP hydrolysis, eIF4A acts as a thermodynamic decondenser by competing for trans RNA-RNA interactions. However, ATP hydrolysis and P i release promotes eIF4A dissociation [73] [74] and allows for RNA refolding either in cis or in trans, with the former favored by the proximity effect. ATP hydrolysis and P i release also frees the eIF4A protein to engage in additional cycles of RNA structural rearrangements [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] , which facilitates more effective RNA decondensation [16] . This indicates that the key difference between a kinetic and thermodynamic decondenser is the off rate for RNA. Other DBPs likely function to limit RNA condensation. For example, knocking down UAP56/DDX39B, which is related to eIF4A and consists of the conserved DBP core domain [78] , increases nuclear speckle size and traps mRNAs in speckles [79] [80] .",

Since RNA binding can be specific, thermodynamic condensers might be important for the compartmentalization of specific RNAs into specialized granules such as neuronal or germ granules. For example, FMRP, Pumilio, and Ataxin2 are slow-exchanging, multivalent RBPs with relatively low intracellular concentrations (Table 1) .

The tail domains can regulate the RNA binding and ATPase activities of DBPs [101] [102] [103] [104] , or engage in protein-protein interactions [103, [105] [106] ] that modulate DBP function and facilitate RNP assembly [80] . Thus, in the ATP-bound state, a DBP bound to RNA and interacting with other proteins can promote assembly of the RNP granule [80, 106] . Subsequently, ATP hydrolysis allows the release from the RNA, and potentially can contribute to transitions or disassembly of the RNP assembly [80, [105] [106] [107] . For example, the DDX3X/Ded1 protein has N-and C-terminal domains that interact with eIF4E, eIF4G, and itself to promote assembly of SG in the ATP bound state, and when ATP is hydrolyzed contributes to release of RNAs from SG [80, [107] [108] [109] J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 14 their RGG RNA binding domains, which promotes SG assembly [93, 112] . Methylation of arginine residues can disrupt interactions between arginine and delocalized \u03c0-systems like nucleobases [113] , with methylation predicted to interfere with RNA binding. Thus, demethylation might increase RNA binding of these factors, promoting RNA condensation. Additional modifications that can affect RNP granule formation include glycosylation [114] , and therefore should inhibit eIF4A's ability to limit RNA condensation.",

Different RNP granules most likely have different requirements for each type of interaction for the granule's respective functions, or for cellular regulation. Additionally, each interaction type may be specific or promiscuous as well as weak or strong, further contributing to defining an RNP granule. RNA chaperones have multiple mechanisms to limit RNA condensation. (A) Thermodynamic decondensers (red) use high-affininty RNA binding to compete for RNA-RNA interaction sites in order to limit RNA condensation. Thermodynamic decondensers therefore lower the valency of RNA and prevent RNA conformational changes by locking RNA conformers in \u2206G wells. (B) Kinetic dencondensers prevent RNA condensation by destabilizing trans RNA-RNA interactions, therefore lowering the activation energy barrier between trans interacting RNAs and dispersed states. Kinetic decondensers also promote cis RNA refolding, thereby reducing the valency of a given RNA. Due to the fact that Kinetic RNA decondensers such as DEAD-box proteins destabilize RNA secondary structure by RNA binding and not by ATP hydrolysis, the key difference between a thermodynamic and kinetic RNA decondenser is the relative off-rate for RNA, with kinetic decondensers binding dynamically.

Box 1. The RNA folding problem and RNA chaperones Given a typical RNA transcript, there are many possible RNA-RNA interactions between transcript regions that would be of similar free energy (Figure IA). These interactions are often metastable, dissociating on very slow timescales. Thus, RNA possesses a rugged folding landscape where molecules have a relatively high probability of being kinetically-trapped in a non-native conformation, a phenomenon referred to as the RNA folding problem [137] (Figure IA). Put differently, the structure of an RNA is best understood as an ensemble of different RNA folds that are in (often very slow)equilibrium with each other[138]. Cells resolve the RNA folding problem through the actions of RNA chaperones[139][140][141][142], which can reduce energy barriers between conformations to resolve kinetic traps (Figure IA)or act thermodynamically to stabilize particular conformations through RNA binding (Figure IB). To resolve kinetic traps, kinetic RNA chaperones promote various degrees of partial RNA unfolding, often through dynamic or catalytic cycles of binding and unbinding[141][142][143], allowing the RNA to refold or to convert to a different conformation through a partially unfolded transition state via a strand displacement mechanism (Figure Ib). Thermodynamic RNA chaperones act by stabilizing or destabilizing particular structures, for example, by blocking interactions or by binding specific structures with high affinity (Figure IB).",

This may also be due to the higher ensemble diversity of mRNAs compared to noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)[71]. Within the nucleus, where RBP concentrations are much higher[71], mRNPs mayadopt a more linear, extended conformation [146-147], consistent with the action of RBPs reducing cis-RNA folding. After nucleocytoplasmic export, the pioneer round of translation removes proteins coating the mRNA such as the exon junction complex and remodels the mRNP [148]. Cytosolic mRNA structures are further modulated by translation, as ribosomes greatly decompact mRNAs [37, 147]. One reason for the generally greater mRNA compaction in the cytosol than the nucleus may be the estimated ~30-fold lower concentration of RBPs relative to RNA [71]. Following translational arrest, ribosomes run off, and mRNAs compact in a 5\u02b9 to 3\u02b9 manner [36, 147]. Due to the proximity effect, cis interactions will occur much faster than trans interactions, meaning that the cis-folding of the RNA determines what RNA surfaces are available to interact in trans. Consistent with this notion, mRNAs undergo compaction independent of their recruitment to SGs [36, 147], implying that the trans RNA-RNA interactions recruiting them to SGs are with the folded mRNAs in the ensemble and not necessarily competing with intramolecular structures.",
