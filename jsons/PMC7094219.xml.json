            "text": "Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a positive\u2010strand RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae that possess genomes of approx. 31 300 nucleotides. MHV has been taxonomically assigned to coronavirus group 2 and is thus a phylogenic neighbour of SARS coronavirus [1], the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (see, e.g., [2] for review). Depending on the strain, MHV can cause hepatitis, encephalitis and demyelinating encephalomyelitis in susceptible rodents [3] and the virus has been used as a model system for infection of the central nervous system (CNS) [4] and virus\u2010induced autoimmune reactions in the CNS [5]. Coronavirus genomes contain up to 15 open reading frames encoding both structural and non\u2010structural proteins [6, 7]. From the largest open reading frames, 1a and 1b, two polyproteins are translated, pp1a (\u223c500 kDa) and pp1ab (\u223c800 kDa), the latter originating from a (\u22121)\u2010ribosomal frameshift occurring in the short overlap region of orf 1a and orf 1b. The two MHV polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non\u2010structural proteins [8] by two papain\u2010like proteinases, PL1pro and PL2pro, which are part of Nsp3 [9], and by the main proteinase (Mpro, Nsp5), which is frequently also called 3C\u2010like proteinase (3CLpro) [10, 11]. Most or all of the 16 non\u2010structural proteins are proposed to be part of the replicase\u2013transcriptase complex, probably mediating all functions necessary for polyprotein processing, viral transcription, and replication [6]. After translation and processing, MHV non\u2010structural proteins form replication complexes that are thought to be associated with multilayered membrane structures [12] or double\u2010membrane vesicles [13]. Most MHV replicase subunits were found to co\u2010localize in discrete foci in the perinuclear region of the infected cell [12, 13, 14, 15]. Dual\u2010labelling studies demonstrated co\u2010localization of, e.g. Nsp8 with the helicase (Nsp13), the nucleocapsid protein, the main proteinase (Nsp5), Nsp7, 9, and 10 [15]. Moreover, Nsp1 specifically binds to Nsp7 and Nsp10 as shown by yeast\u2010two\u2010hybrid and co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments [16]. These examples of interactions between coronavirus Nsps are likely to be the tip of an iceberg of protein\u2013protein interactions that drive the formation of the replication\u2013transcription complex and, probably, are critical to its function. In temperature\u2010sensitive mutants of MHV\u2010A59 [7], mutations assigned to Nsp4, 5, 10, 12, 14, and 16 are responsible for a variety of defects in RNA synthesis. Therefore, these proteins are assumed to be essential components of the replicase\u2013transcriptase and to fulfil distinct functions in negative\u2010 and/or positive\u2010strand RNA synthesis.",

Although the cysteines were substituted by alanines in mutagenesis experiments [17], the residues involved in dimerization could not be assigned unambiguously. Interestingly, a temperature\u2010sensitive MHV Nsp10 mutant, in which the highly conserved Gln65 was substituted by Glu, appeared to be defective in continuing negative\u2010strand RNA synthesis [7].",

The ZIGE device was adapted from [21]. The sample application comb for protein and nucleic acids had to be modified according to Fig. 1\n, because Nsp10 and nucleic acids migrate in opposite directions at pH 6.0. The agarose was dissolved in running buffer (20 mM MES, 50 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.0). Electrophoresis was performed at 4 \u00b0C. The protein samples were mixed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and a trace of bromophenolblue (BPB) dye. 10 \u03bcl\u2010sample volumes with protein concentrations of 40 \u03bcM were applied to the small slots.

After subsequent size\u2010exclusion chromatography, a relatively pure protein preparation was obtained that exhibited an apparent molecular mass of \u223c16 kDa in denaturing and reducing SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 2\nA). This value agreed well with the molecular mass deduced from the amino\u2010acid sequence (15.4 kDa). Owing to the hexahistidine tag, the Nsp10 could be readily detected in immunoblots using an anti\u2010tetrahistidine antibody (Fig. 2B). In the non\u2010reducing SDS\u2013PAGE, a faint band, possibly corresponding to a dimeric form, was detected in addition to the main band (not shown). Remarkably, Nsp10 preparations obtained from cultures that had been supplemented with either cobalt (Nsp10 + Co) or iron ions (Nsp10 + Fe), were coloured blue and light red, respectively, during gel filtration.

In contrast, dynamic light scattering of Nsp10 revealed several different states of oligomerization, depending on the conditions applied (Fig. 4\n). In the absence of metal ion supplements, but with 20 mM glutathione present, the protein solution (2.8 mg/ml) showed a monodisperse peak at a Stokes radius of 9 nm (Fig. 4A). Assuming the corresponding Nsp10 oligomer to be spherical, a molecular mass of around 600 kDa, corresponding to higher\u2010order aggregates, can be calculated from this. Nsp10 + Zn, Nsp10 + Co, and Nsp10 + Fe samples tended to be polydisperse (Figs. 4B\u2013D) and the intensity of the peaks decreased. The following main peaks were observed in these samples: Nsp10 + Zn at 3.9 and 38 nm (corresponding to an 80 kDa and to a very large aggregate, respectively); Nsp10 + Co at 6 nm (223 kDa), and Nsp10 + Fe at 2.4 nm (24.2 kDa). The cobalt\u2010supplemented protein displayed the most polydisperse distribution among these DLS measurements. Interestingly, when double\u2010stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were added to the Nsp10 + Zn solution, all indications of an oligomeric association state vanished and a clear, monodisperse signal at a Stokes radius of 2.0 nm, corresponding to a 16.3 kDa Nsp10 monomer, was observed (Fig. 4E). When a single\u2010stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was added, a more polydisperse pattern with a main peak at a Stokes radius of 2.2 nm resulted (Fig. 4F).",

MHV Nsp10 was found to be a metalloprotein that favours zinc\u2010ion binding over ferrous/ferric ion and Co2+ (Table 1\n). Nsp10 purified from expression cultures not supplemented with any metal ion (Nsp10\u2010Me) bound 0.8 Zn2+ per Nsp10 monomer. The Zn2+ content of Nsp10 + Zn was up to 1.84 ions Zn2+ per Nsp10 monomer. Remarkably, Nsp10 + Co and Nsp10 + Fe preparations exhibited a 3\u20134 times higher content of Zn2+ compared to Co2+ or Fe2+/3+, even though the cells were grown in the presence of very high concentrations of the latter. Presumably, the zinc ions originated from the 4\u00d7 TY medium that was used in growing the cells. The lowest total metal ion content was displayed by Nsp + Fe samples (Table 1). Nevertheless, also in the Zn2+\u2010supplemented sample (Nsp10 + Zn), about 12% of the total metal ion content was contributed by ferrous/ferric ions. In the Nsp10 + Zn and the Nsp10 + Fe samples, there was almost the same amount of iron bound, clearly indicating the preference of Nsp10 for Zn2+ over Fe2+/3+. Only minor amounts of Co2+ were detected in Nsp10 + Zn and Nsp10 + Fe samples, suggesting that among the three metal ions tested, Co2+ has the lowest binding affinity to Nsp10.",

The observed stoichiometry is \u223c2 Zn2+ per Nsp10 monomer. Even when cobalt or iron are added in excess to the expression medium, most of the bound metal is zinc, suggesting that zinc ions bind to Nsp10 under physiological conditions of expression in infected cells. A sequence alignment of coronaviral Nsp10 proteins shows that nine of the ten cysteine residues of MHV Nsp10 are strictly conserved in all three coronavirus groups (Fig. 7\n). Within its C\u2010terminal half, the motif C74\u2013X2\u2013C77\u2013X5\u2013H83\u2013X6\u2013C90 is found, which could constitute a classical zinc finger of the CCHC type. Residue His83 of this motif is also absolutely conserved throughout the coronaviruses. This motif is followed by a second potential zinc finger displaying the sequence C116\u2013X2\u2013C119\u2013X7\u2013C127\u2013X\u2013C129, which would belong to the CCCC type. The presence of more than one zinc finger is quite common in transcription factors. However, we cannot exclude that the conserved Cys residues 17 and 41 of the N\u2010terminal part of Nsp10 may also be involved in complexation of Zn2+, even though they do not match with one of the canonical zinc binding motifs. Cys45 is the only cysteine residue in MHV Nsp10 that is not conserved throughout the Coronaviridae, and is therefore unlikely to be involved in metal ion binding.",
