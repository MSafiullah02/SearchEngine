This often cause species loss, result in lower fish abundance, and large losses to the tourism sector. The algae are hard or impossible to get rid of, the corals might never come back. The people living off the reef can lose livelihoods dependent on tourism and fisheries. A resilient reef would be able to return back and the communities around it continue to develop.",

            "text": "When a crisis hit, the resilience often comes from places less anticipated or even neglected. For example, a case study of a shift from algae to coral dominated communities on the Great Barrier Reef showed that recovery was primarily driven by one single species that is relatively rare on the reef, a species that easily can go extinct without notice under normal conditions but that is needed in crisis (Bellwood et al. 2006). Similarly, it is the less dominating species in a mature forest that often invades first and prepare the grounds for the return of the forest after a fire. Species that are less visible, and seem less valuable, can have a big role to play for the system to rebuild itself.",

In Sweden, undervaluing their work for a long time in terms of allowing a high degree of job insecurity and low pay seem to be one of the major drivers behind the relatively high death tolls we now face in the country as the virus spread in old age homes. In the food system we suddenly realize our dependence on migrant farm workers who cannot pass across borders thus putting this year\u2019s harvest at risk, and on the people working with food distribution, who can step up and help eat-in restaurants turn to home delivery services, and get groceries to our door as we avoid stores.",

Much of the biosphere\u2019s resources have been appropriated for the production of harvestable biomass in the form of food, fuel and fibre. We have created a global production ecosystem that is homogenous, highly connected and characterized by weakened internal feedbacks. We get high and more predictable yields of biomass in the short term, but with new conditions for novel and pervasive risks to emerge in the longer term (Nystr\u00f6m et al. 2019). We have too little understanding today of what we already have lost of the invisible species and social-ecological connections that build the resilience of the global production ecosystem and will sustain us in the future and we must urgently step up this type of research.",
