There was a clear decrease in pathogenicity for the respiratory tract and kidneys when the virus had undergone a large number of passages. Passage level 80 was investigated for safety for the reproductive tract in 1-day-old and 7-day-old SPF chickens. In 1-day-old chickens, 12.5% of the vaccinated birds had macroscopic lesions. No lesions were observed if the chickens had been vaccinated at 7 days of age. Passage level 80 was investigated for its ability to spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated chickens and for dissemination in the body. The virus was able to spread from vaccinated chickens to groups of non-vaccinated chickens, and in the vaccinated birds the virus was found frequently in oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs. A fragment of the hypervariable region of the S1 protein of passage level 80 was sequenced and revealed nucleotide changes resulting in two amino acid substitutions. Passage level 80 was given additional passages to levels 82 and 85. Both passage levels were tested for efficacy in SPF chickens and passage level 85 was tested for efficacy in commercial chickens with maternally derived antibodies (MDA) against a challenge with QX-like strain IB D388.

The degree of virulence of virus at the various egg passage levels was determined by administering the virus to chicks, just after hatching, by eye drop at a titre of 10 6.0 EID 50 per dose in 0.1 to 0.2 ml. A dose of 10 6.0 EID 50 was used in the safety tests for the respiratory tract and kidneys, because the EP requires testing 10 times the maximum release titre for safety of the respiratory tract, and testing the maximal release titre in the test for safety of the reproductive tract. It was anticipated that a dose of 10 5.0 EID 50 would be the maximal titre for the vaccine. In Experiment A we tested egg passage levels 8, 25, 40 and 50, and in Experiment B we tested egg passage levels 65 and 80. In each test, a non-infected control group was included. Five chickens were killed humanely 5 days after inoculation, by inhalation of 100% carbon dioxide, another five birds at 7 days after inoculation and the remaining five birds at 10 days after inoculation. The ciliostasis test was performed in accordance with the EP. Briefly, the trachea was removed, rinsed and stored in physiological saline at 378C. Transverse sections of 0.6 mm of the trachea were made using a McIlwain Tissue Chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co. Ltd, Surrey, UK). The ciliary activity of three, four and three sections of, respectively, the upper, middle and lower part of the trachea was determined by light microscopy at a magnification of 400). A score of 0 was given if the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed movement; a score of 1 was given if the cilia of 67% to 100% of the tracheal section showed movement; a score of 2 if the cilia of 33% to 67% of the trachea showed movement; a score of 3 if the cilia of less than 33% but not 0% of the tracheal section showed movement; and a score of 4 if the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed no movement at all.

The samples of the passage levels 82 and 85 were lyophilized; the samples of passage level 101 were frozen allantoic fluid. IB strain L1148 at passage levels 82 and 85 was chosen to test its efficacy as a vaccine against challenge with a virulent IB QX-like virus, because we took into account that passage level 80 would most probably be the passage level of the master seed virus. In order to be able to produce a vaccine from the master seed virus, a few passages are required to scale up the virus. Passage 101 was tested to investigate whether higher passage levels would also be efficacious. Vaccine titres per dose of 10 3.0 and 10 3.3 EID 50 were chosen because it was anticipated that a vaccine based on the attenuated IB L1148 strain would have a minimal titre of 10 3.0 or 10 3.3 EID 50 per dose. The freeze-dried vaccines were reconstituted in distilled water. Reconstituted virus and the allantoic fluid of passage 101 were further diluted to the appropriate titre in distilled water. The chickens were vaccinated by coarse spray using a Hozelock flower sprayer. Generation of pressure and flow had been determined before vaccination began. The sprayer had a flow rate of approx. 2.5 ml/sec. Before vaccination, the exact vaccination time for the applicable number of birds was determined (0.5 ml per bird) and the sprayer was disinfected with 70% ethanol, followed by three rinses with distilled water. After preparation, the container with the diluted vaccine was placed in a water bath with melting ice. Just before vaccination the vaccine was put into the sprayer and the sprayer was put under pressure by moving the pump up and down 40 times. Prior to vaccination, it was tested for flow. The chicks, which had been placed in a small box, were vaccinated by spraying the vaccine from a height of 40 to 50 cm for the predetermined period. After spraying, the chicks were kept for at least 15 min inside the box. Subsequently, the chicks were released into their housing facilities. A non-vaccinated group served as control. At 21 days of age, 20 chickens taken from each group were challenged with 10 4.0 EID 50 IB D388 per dose of 0.1 ml. The challenge virus was applied by eye-drop. Of the non-vaccinated group, one-half was challenged and the other half was not challenged. During the whole study period the chickens were observed daily for clinical signs. Five days after challenge, the ciliary activity of tracheal explants was examined in 20 chickens per vaccine group and in 10 chickens per control group. Chickens were killed by injecting sodium pentobarbital (T61) intravenously. Immediately after death the trachea was removed and rinsed with, and stored in, physiological saline at 378C. Small transverse sections of the trachea were cut by hand. Ciliary activity of three sections of the upper part, four sections of the middle part and three sections of the lower part of the trachea were examined by light microscopy at a magnification of 400).

The substitutions we detected were different from those found by Huang & Wang (2007) . The role of these substitutions remains unclear. We found that there was a clear effect of increased egg passage level on the results of ciliostasis scores. The effect was not gradual. There was a clear decrease in ciliostasis scores after 25 passages, followed by an increase until passage level 50. After 50 passages, ciliostasis scores decreased again. To our knowledge this effect has not been reported before. At passage level 80 a ciliostasis score of 11 was determined, which is much lower than the maximum score of 40, often found with virulent IB strains, therefore the virulence of the virus strain for the respiratory tract has been decreased significantly. There is no threshold defined to distinguish safe IB strains from an unsafe one. In the EP monograph, an average value of 25 has been indicated for many years as the threshold, but nowadays the requirement is that a risk\u00c1benefit analysis should be made, taking into account the average ciliostasis score and the benefits expected from the use of the vaccine. The average ciliostasis score for passage level 80 was well below the threshold of 25.

In the contact birds that were infected by spreading of the virus from the vaccinated chickens, we found that oro-pharyngeal swabs were often virus-positive, whereas in the tracheal tissues the virus could no longer be detected. This may be because the cells producing the virus had been destroyed, whereas the virus that was produced from these cells was still present.

Furthermore, it has to be said that the PCR test detects genomic material of the virus*that is, a part of the genomic region coding for the hypervariable region of the S1 protein*whereas the IHC staining method is based on the reactivity of a monoclonal antibody with the nucleoprotein of the virus.
