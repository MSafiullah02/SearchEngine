            "text": "Morbidity and mortality caused by severe influenza infections reflect properties that are intrinsic to the virus strain, including replication potential, receptor usage, and cytopathic effects on pulmonary epithelial cells (Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2010, Tscherne and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2011). In addition to viral-intrinsic factors, host-specific traits such as divergent susceptibilities to infection as well as differences in host immune responses may ameliorate or exacerbate both infection and clinical outcome. An overly aggressive innate response, with early recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the lung, was a key contributor to the morbidity of the 1918 influenza infection (Kobasa et al., 2007). More recent clinical literature on avian H5N1 infection documented a significant association between excessive early cytokine responses, immune cell recruitment, and poor outcome (de Jong et al., 2006). Public health approaches to influenza pandemics have relied primarily on preventative vaccine strategies and supportive measures, including the use of antiviral therapies. Nevertheless, the speed at which the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus swine pandemic spread during the lag of vaccine availability highlighted the need to identify additional mechanisms for amelioration of influenza virus infection (Openshaw and Dunning, 2010). Antiviral drugs inhibiting virus replication may select for mutational escape, rendering the therapy ineffective. Modulation of the host immune response has the potential advantage of exerting less-selective pressure on viral populations. Though the prospect of blunting cytokine storm is enticing, a major limitation to treating diseases in which cytokine storm contributes to pathogenesis is the limited understanding of the cellular triggers of this process. Thus, we sought to define cellular signaling pathways that are chemically tractable to test the hypothesis that modulating cytokine storm would provide insight into influenza pathogenesis, with potential therapeutic implications.",

Due to the immunomodulatory properties of S1P receptor signaling, chemical agonists have been used successfully for the treatment of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al., 2010). Though the systems biology of the S1P receptors is complex, with five receptor subtypes, differential expression, coupling, attenuation, and catabolism (Rosen and Liao, 2003), the availability of selective chemical probes together with mouse genetic models allows detailed insights into immunopathogenesis. We previously showed that a nonselective S1P receptor agonist inhibited cytokine storm, dendritic cell migration, and subsequent antigen-specific T cell proliferation, protecting the lung tissue from host-mediated injury. Alleviation of immunopathology by the nonselective S1P receptor agonist did not affect virus clearance nor the production of neutralizing antibodies, demonstrating that, although cytokine storm was diminished, retention of a sufficient cellular and humoral immune response, as well as long-term protective immunity, still occurs (Marsolais et al., 2008, Marsolais et al., 2009).",

We reveal that cytokine secretion and immune cell infiltration are separable events that are both regulated by the pulmonary endothelium. Further, we demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P1 signaling results in reduced mortality during human pathogenic influenza virus challenge. Thus, S1P1 receptor signaling in endothelium provides a mechanism for attenuation of influenza virus-induced morbidity and reveals an unexpected role for endothelial cells as regulators of cytokine storm.",

            "text": "Previously, we reported that treatment of influenza virus-infected mice with AAL-R, a promiscuous S1P receptor agonist for S1P1 and S1P3\u20135 receptors, inhibits early proinflammatory cytokine expression and innate immune cell accumulation within the lung (Marsolais et al., 2008, Marsolais et al., 2009). To assess the contribution of S1P1 receptor signaling in inhibition of influenza virus-induced early inflammation, infected mice were treated with the S1P1 receptor-specific agonist CYM-5442 (Gonzalez-Cabrera et al., 2008). Treatment with 2 mg/kg of CYM-5442 twice daily significantly inhibited secretion of cytokines and chemokines associated with influenza virus-induced pathology, including IFN-\u03b1, CCL2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 1A) in addition to CCL3, CCL5, CXCL2, and IL-1\u03b1 (Figure S1A), compared to vehicle-treated mice 48 hr postinfection. CYM-5442 reduction of IFN-\u03b1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-6 expression was as complete as treatment with the promiscuous agonist; however, it was not as effective as AAL-R in suppressing CXCL2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 1A and Figure S1A), suggesting a role for other S1P receptors in modulating those cytokines. In addition to inhibiting cytokine/chemokine production, AAL-R and CYM-5442 administration to influenza virus-infected mice blunted the accumulation of innate inflammatory infiltrate characterized as macrophages/monocytes (CD11b+, F480+, Ly6G\u2212), neutrophils (CD11b+, LyG6+, F480\u2212), and NK cells (NK1.1+, CD3\u2212), although AAL-R was more effective at inhibiting macrophage/monocyte and NK cell accumulation in the lung (Figure 1B). We also observed significantly reduced CD69 expression on macrophage/monocytes and NK cells following treatment with either CYM-5442 or AAL-R 48 hr postinfection, demonstrating diminished cell activation (Figures 1C and 1D). Despite significant blunting of innate immune cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine responses, we observed no differences in viral titers following AAL-R or CYM-5442 treatment compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure S2\n), demonstrating that S1P1 agonism neither inhibits nor enhances viral replication. Collectively, these results reveal that activation of a single sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor, S1P1, is sufficient to blunt global innate inflammation following mouse-adapted influenza virus infection in mice.",

To test this, we infected mice with a virulent isolate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus that was isolated from a hospitalized patient and has never been passaged through mice (A/Wisconsin/WSLH34939/09) (Itoh et al., 2009). Infection of C57BL/6J mice with this strain causes severe disease, resulting in rapid mortality beginning between days 4 and 6 postinfection (data not shown). Similar to infection with mouse-adapted WSN influenza virus, treatment with CYM-5442 following infection with H1N1:2009 significantly suppressed cytokine and chemokine responses and the accumulation of activated innate immune cells 48 hr postinfection (Figures 2A and 2B). We also tested an additional S1P1 receptor-selective agonist (RP-002) to provide support for S1P1 receptor specificity and to show directly that S1P1-selective agonists share this modulation of innate immunopathology. We infected mice with H1N1:2009 pandemic influenza virus as above and treated mice with RP-002 at 1 and 25 hr postinfection. Similar to what we observed with CYM-5442, RP-002 treatment significantly inhibited the production of multiple proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines (Figure 2C) and suppressed the accumulation of activated (CD69+) macrophages/monocytes and NK cells in the infected lung 48 hr postinfection (Figure 2D). Moreover, RP-002-mediated suppression of innate immune cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine production occurred without altering lung viral titers (Figure S3\n), demonstrating that S1P1 agonist-mediated suppression of cytokines and chemokines is not due to direct effects on influenza virus replication.",

In order not to impose additional stress on the infected lung and because oral delivery is a popular route for drug administration, we orally administered the S1P1 agonist, RP-002, at 6 mg/kg by gavage to C57BL/6J mice infected with 1 \u00d7 105 PFU of A/Wisconsin/WSLH/34939/09 at 1 and 25 hr postinfection.

Moreover, RP-002 treatment resulted in significant improvement in overall survival compared to vehicle-treated mice (20% mortality in RP-002 versus 80% mortality for vehicle, p < 0.005; Figure 3C). These findings demonstrate a significant biological phenotype resulting from early S1P1 receptor agonist treatment following pathogenic influenza virus infection. By showing directly that aborting an early step in cytokine amplification significantly protects against an ordinarily lethal human pathogenic H1N1:2009 infection, the findings expand previous observations of an association between humans and animal models in which dysregulation of innate immune responses contributes to morbidity and mortality. Importantly, treatment with RP-002 ameliorated morbidity and mortality associated with human pathogenic H1N1:2009 severe influenza infection. Effects upon survival are in keeping with our previously published data (Marsolais et al., 2009) that this mechanism does not alter virus-specific neutralizing antibody response, affinity maturation, and class switching. This documents that the cytokine storm plays a direct and cardinal role in influenza-mediated lung disease. We then sought to delineate the mechanism of S1P1 suppression of cytokine amplification.",

This mouse model allowed direct detection of eGFP-S1P1 receptor protein expression by flow cytometry, with additional biochemical confirmation using highly specific antibodies for GFP followed by western blotting that distinguishes the fused S1P1-eGFP receptor by specific molecular weight. High levels of S1P1-eGFP were detected on lung lymphatic (CD45\u2212, CD31+, gp38+) and vascular (CD45\u2212, CD31+, gp38\u2212) endothelium, whereas pulmonary epithelium (CD45\u2212, CD31\u2212, EpCAM+) was negative for S1P1-eGFP (Figure 4A). As reported previously, CD4+ T cells (CD4+, CD3+), CD8+ T cells (CD4+, CD3+), and B cells (B220+, CD19+) expressed S1P1-eGFP (Figure 4B), whereas leukocytes, including macrophages/monocytes, a subset of alveolar macrophages (F480+, CD11c+, CD11b\u2212), dendritic cells (CD11c+, I/A-I/E+, CD205+, F480\u2212), neutrophils, NK cells (NK1.1+, CD3-), and innate lymphoid cells (Lin\u2212Sca1+), expressed negligible levels of S1P1-eGFP (Figure 4C and data not shown). Cells from uninfected mice expressed similar levels of S1P1-eGFP as infected mice, demonstrating that S1P1 receptor expression is not altered following influenza virus infection (Figure 4D). To confirm the S1P1-eGFP expression pattern, a western blot for S1P1-eGFP was performed on cells FACS sorted from the lungs of infected and uninfected mice. Endothelial cells, T cells, and B cells were positive for S1P1-eGFP in uninfected mice, confirming our flow cytometry results (Figure S4A). However, though S1P1-eGFP was detected by western blot in B cells from uninfected mice, we did not detect S1P1-eGFP expression by western Blot in influenza virus-infected lung-resident B cells (Figure S4A). We did not detect S1P1-eGFP expression by western blot in epithelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, and alveolar macrophages either before or after influenza virus infection (Figure S4A). Moreover, CYM-5442 treatment of infected S1P1-eGFP knockin mice did not diminish expression of S1P1-eGFP on endothelial cells, T cells, or B cells, demonstrating that administration of this S1P1-specific agonist does not induce degradation of the S1P1 receptor (Figure S4B). Therefore, CYM-5442 does not exert an antagonistic effect due to receptor degradation, demonstrating functional agonism of S1P1 as the mechanism by which CYM-5442 suppresses cytokine storm.",

It is plausible that lymphocytes within the lung provide a bystander effect during the innate immune response to influenza virus infection. To rule out a role for lymphocytes during S1P1 receptor-mediated inhibition of inflammation following influenza virus infection, lymphocyte-deficient Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected and treated with vehicle or CYM-5442. Administration of CYM-5442 to influenza virus-infected Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in significant inhibition of expression of IFN-\u03b1, CCL2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 5A), in addition to CCL5, CXCL2, and CXCL10 (Figure S1B). Atypical lymphocyte populations that could, in principal, contribute to suppression of cytokine production did not express S1P1-eGFP and thus also do not contribute to this mechanism. Inflammatory cell infiltrates, including macrophages/monocytes and NK cells, were significantly reduced in CYM-5442-treated Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5B). Reduced numbers of neutrophils were also observed within the infected lung, but the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 5B). Moreover, lung-infiltrating macrophages and NK cells in Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice were less activated, as measured by CD69 surface expression (Figure S5\n). CYM-5442 treatment of influenza virus-infected lymphocyte-deficient mice inhibits the innate inflammatory response, excluding a role for lymphocytes as key regulators of influenza virus-induced cytokine storm.",

Endothelial cells expressed elevated levels of the chemokines CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 at the mRNA level (Figure 6A).

Though myelomonocytic recruitment is not modulated by endothelial permeability changes, we formally assessed whether suppression of inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung reflected a passive inhibition of leukocyte recruitment or whether suppression of chemokines on lung endothelial cells limits innate immune cell recruitment. Rescue experiments were performed in which mice were infected with influenza in the presence or absence of intratracheal administration of recombinant murine CCL2 (rmCCL2), with or without CYM-5442 treatment. Administration of rmCCL2 to infected mice treated with CYM-5442 restored macrophage/monocyte and NK cell numbers in the lung to levels equivalent to infected mice treated with vehicle (Figure 6E) 48 hr postinfection. These data demonstrate that CYM-5442 inhibition of cellular infiltration into the lung is not due to the enhancement of endothelial cell barrier function but due to suppression of chemokine production. Therefore, S1P1 receptor agonism suppresses endothelial cell chemokine expression, resulting in diminished cell infiltration. Despite the rescue of CCL2 levels in the BALF and the restoration of macrophage/monocyte recruitment into the lung of CYM-5442-treated mice, global cytokine and chemokine production was not restored (Figure 6F and Figure S1C). Influenza virus infection of CCR2-deficient mice results in substantial reductions of infiltrating macrophages/monocytes (Dawson et al., 2000). To rule out infiltrating macrophages, we infected CCR2-deficient mice with WSN influenza virus as done above and treated with either vehicle or CYM-5442. Infection of CCR2-deficient mice resulted in significantly reduced numbers of macrophages/monocytes without altering neutrophil or NK cell numbers in the lung 48 hr postinfection (Figure S7A). Despite reduced levels of macrophages/monocytes in the lung, we still detected significant levels of IFN-\u03b1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure S7B). More importantly, treatment of CCR2-deficient mice with CYM-5442 still significantly reduced all cytokines and chemokines tested at 48 hr postinfection except for CCL5 (Figure S7B). Failure to inhibit cytokine and chemokine production in CCR2-deficient mice or to re-establish cytokine and chemokine production by the induction of macrophage/monocyte cell infiltration through rmCCL2 administration following CYM-5442 treatment suggests that monocytes and macrophages are not major sources of early cytokine and chemokine production. Furthermore, these data indicate that cell recruitment and cytokine responses may be uncoupled events.",

            "text": "Infiltration of macrophages and NK cells alone does not appear to be associated with cytokine storm. Therefore, we evaluated the contribution of total inflammatory cell infiltration to cytokine production during influenza virus infection. Mice were treated with an anti-CD11b antibody (M7/80) that has been shown to inhibit the recruitment of CD11b-expressing cells into inflamed tissues (Rosen and Gordon, 1987). Though treatment with anti-CD11b significantly inhibited the recruitment of macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells into the lung (Figure 7A), we observed no reduction in levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, other than IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 7B), which is probably a direct result of diminished infiltration of NK cells, the primary source of IFN-\u03b3 at this time point. Moreover, treatment with CYM-5442 significantly inhibited the production of IFN-\u03b1, CCL2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 7B), in addition to CCL3, CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, and IL-1\u03b1 (Figure S1D) in anti-CD11b-treated mice. These results further demonstrate that innate cell recruitment and cytokine production are independent events early after influenza virus infection, both which are inhibited by S1P1 receptor agonism of pulmonary endothelial cells. Importantly, our data demonstrate that inflammatory cell infiltration into the lung is not required for cytokine and chemokine production. An additional line of evidence excluding hematopoietic cells from S1P1 agonist-mediated reduction of early innate cytokine and chemokine responses following influenza virus infection was provided by irradiation resistance of S1P1 agonist suppression. C57BL/6J mice were irradiated with 500 rads and 24 hr later infected with WSN influenza virus and treated with either vehicle or CYM-5442. Irradiation reduced CD45+ hematopoietic cells in lung by 90% (vehicle: 2 \u00d7 107 cell/lung versus 500 rads: 2 \u00d7 106 cells/lung), and importantly, treatment of irradiated mice with CYM-5542 significantly reduced the levels of IFN-\u03b1 (irradiated vehicle: 86 pg/ml versus irradiated CYM-5442: 17.9 pg/ml, p = 0.0006), CCL2 (irradiated vehicle: 944 pg/ml versus irradiated CYM-5442: 452 pg/ml, p = 0.00002), CXCL10 (irradiated vehicle: 204 pg/ml versus irradiated CYM-5442: 83 pg/ml, p = 0.00003), and IL-6 (irradiated vehicle: 170 pg/ml versus irradiated CYM-5442: 70 pg/ml, p = 0.0001), demonstrating that a radiation-resistant cell population mediated S1P1 receptor-mediated suppression of the inflammatory response. These results, coupled with the restricted S1P1 receptor expression pattern, support an important role for endothelial cells in regulating pulmonary innate immune responses to influenza virus.",

            "text": "Type I interferons, predominantly IFN-\u03b1 species, are elevated early after respiratory virus infection and are thought to be crucial for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Our results thus far have demonstrated that CYM-5442 treatment consistently inhibits the production of IFN-\u03b1 in the lung early after influenza virus infection (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 5, and Figure 6). Therefore, we postulated that blunting IFN-\u03b1 production may be a mechanism by which CYM-5442 inhibits cytokine storm early after influenza virus infection. To address this, we infected IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout mice with influenza virus, treated these mice with either vehicle or CYM-5442, and measured innate cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine production 48 hr postinfection. Significant differences were not observed in inflammatory cell recruitment of macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells into the lung of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice when compared to C57Bl/6J mice (Figure 7C). As seen with infected C57BL/6J mice, CYM-5442 treatment inhibited innate immune cell recruitment in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice 48 hr postinfection (Figure 7C). Despite recruitment of innate immune cells into the lung of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice 48 hr postinfection, these mice exhibited significantly reduced levels of IFN-\u03b1, CCL2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 7D) in addition to CCL5 and CXCL10 in the BALF fluid (Figure S1E). Taken together, our data demonstrate that regulation of cellular recruitment into the pulmonary tissue is mediated by endothelial cells and is independent of type I interferon signaling. Moreover, S1P1 receptor agonism of endothelial cells inhibits IFN-\u03b1 production and results in the dampening of global proinflammatory cytokine responses.",

Contrary to current dogma, which places lung epithelium and inflammatory infiltrate at the center of influenza virus-induced cytokine storm (La Gruta et al., 2007), we demonstrate here a central role for pulmonary endothelium in regulating this process. Furthermore, we determined that both innate immune cell recruitment and early innate cytokine and chemokine production are uncoupled events, with endothelial cells at the center of both processes. The chemical and genetic approaches shown here have a potentially broad impact on understanding disease pathogenesis. Early dysregulation of innate cellular and cytokine responses predict disease severity and death during highly pathogenic influenza virus infection (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2009, Cill\u00f3niz et al., 2009, de Jong et al., 2006, Kobasa et al., 2004, Kobasa et al., 2007). The early induction of the cytokines IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-6 and the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2 (IL-8), and CXCL10 are associated with symptom formation in humans (Hayden et al., 1998, Kaiser et al., 2001). TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 possess multifunctional activities and are associated with morbidity during influenza virus infection. Chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, and CXCL10 induce the recruitment of innate immune cells into the lung, which can release more cytokines exacerbating cytokine storm and further damage the lung. We demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P1 signaling on endothelial cells results in significantly reduced mortality during infection of mice with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus (Figure 3). Importantly, our results identify a pulmonary cell type, endothelial cells, as potential targets for suppressing excessive innate inflammatory responses.",

The requirement of type I interferon signaling for the early production of multiple cytokines and chemokines after influenza virus infection is striking. Moreover, production of proinflammatory cytokines requires type I interferon signaling, but the type I interferon pathway is dispensable for cell recruitment. Though type I interferon signaling is well known to inhibit viral replication (Garc\u00eda-Sastre and Biron, 2006), evidence also points to pathogenic roles for IFN-\u03b1 during viral infection. Several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are downstream of type I interferon receptor signaling. Moreover, disease onset correlates directly with local respiratory production of IFN-\u03b1 in humans (Hayden et al., 1998). Thus, type I interferon signaling may play dual roles in viral pathogenesis and viral clearance. S1P1 receptor signaling on pulmonary endothelial cells in vivo blunts but does not abolish IFN-\u03b1 production and may explain why pathology is lessened without compromising the host's ability to clear the virus.",

            "text": "The ability of S1P1 receptor activation to suppress cytokine and chemokine production in the lung in irradiated mice, coupled to the pattern of S1P1 receptor expression in the lung, strongly indicates a central endothelial component to early innate immune responses. An interesting question is whether lung lymphatic, vascular, or both endothelial cell populations are directly responsible for the observed immune modulation. Moreover, of the large receptor reserve in blood, endothelium ensures that S1P1 receptor expression is maintained on both basolateral and luminal surfaces of the targeted endothelial cell populations (Cahalan et al., 2011) and retains a responsiveness to agonist. Additional approaches to separate blood and lymphatic contributions are still needed. Though we know that endothelial cells produce chemokines, endothelial-mediated regulation of cytokine production in the lung still needs to be determined. It is possible that endothelial cells may regulate cytokine production in the lung through a complex crosstalk mechanism with lung epithelium or resident hematopoietic cells. Nevertheless, the identification of endothelial cells as central orchestrators of early innate immune-mediated inflammation is of fundamental interest and has broad implications for treating multiple diseases. The contribution of aberrant proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production to pathogenesis has been reported for viral and bacterial diseases, including HIV (Stacey et al., 2009), Hantavirus (Borges et al., 2006), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Thiel and Weber, 2008), and pneumococcal bacterial pneumonia (Bergeron et al., 1998). Further, the etiology of several autoimmune conditions has been directly associated with excessive innate immune responses (Kawane et al., 2010, Link, 1998). Thus, understanding the cellular pathways that regulate cytokine storm and developing appropriate chemical signaling tools to identify pathophysiological points of control not only provide insight into microbial-host interactions, but also may ultimately reveal additional approaches to achieve effective immunotherapy in multiple diseases. In addition, our results present a nonlymphopenic mechanism by which sphingosine analog treatment suppresses pathogenic immune responses. Lastly, these data suggest that endogenous S1P acting on endothelial S1P1 receptor could be a negative regulator of cytokine amplification and raise the possibility that heterogeneities in S1P metabolism between individuals could contribute to the advantages or disadvantages conferred by genetic individuality to host survival in a number of diseases.",
