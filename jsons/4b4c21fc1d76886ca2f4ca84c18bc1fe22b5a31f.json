High levels of community spread can potentially impair the ability of the health systems to cope with the numbers of patients needing care, and hence a genuine rise in fatality risk. Locations that have limited testing capability are likely to see higher CFRs as only the most severe cases are identified and the denominator in the CRF ratio remains understated. Survival time from case confirmation to death is likely to be shorter when cases of infection are confirmed only in advanced stage of the disease, for example at the time of hospitalization. In the earliest stages of the epidemic, there may be a lack of awareness of the need to test for the disease, or there may not be suitable available tests to diagnose the disease. In this situation, both the number of infected cases and the number of deaths attributable to the disease may be understated.",

A further factor is that because Covid-19 is most dangerous for older people with co-morbidities, Koreans aged in their 70's and 80's, who were children at the time of the Korean War and just afterwards, may carry additional co-morbidities specifically due to nutritional and other legacy effects of that war-time experience [8] . Finally, there may be differences in standard hospital treatment regimens (including in ICU's) that are important and which need to be identified. Korea also has higher rates of antibiotic resistance than Australia for many pathogens (9, 10) . If bacterial secondary infections contribute to deaths of people with Covid-19, this might be additional factor.",

This experience is similar to what occurred in Korea, with Europe and the Americas their main source for imported cases. But Korea's large initial outbreak and then local transmission clusters were more likely related to strains from China (11) . So, viruses more recently from people infected in China, likely contributed a larger proportion of their cases compared to Australia. This might be of significance if strains have changed in their pathogenicity in different regions with time.",

Another important observation is that the fatality pattern for Covid-19 appears to have quite a long tail. Although the disease can cause fatalities shorty after case confirmation, there remains a risk of a fatality occurring even more than a month after case confirmation. A factor in seeing a more prolonged time between case confirmation and death could be that when a health system is able to cope, patients will likely spend much longer times in ICU and with more interventions than when a health system is overwhelmed. If this is true, we may see shorter trailing fatalities when data becomes available for stressed hospital systems such as in Italy, the UK and New York State.",

The solid line show a pattern of initially falling CFRs due to the initial under identification of cases at the start of the epidemic, discussed above in the context ofFigures 1 and 2. The broken lines show the projected evolution of the CFRs if each country ceased having any more covid-19 cases at the 7 th May, and the current case load was held through to resolution. The dotted lines asymptote are the terminal values of CFR Terminal of 1.46% for Australia and 2.43% for South Korea. Differences in CFR Terminal reflect fundamental difference the counties' fatality rates after removing the case resolution effects due to timing differences in the arrival and evolution of the epidemic.",
