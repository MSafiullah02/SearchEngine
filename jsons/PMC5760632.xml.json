CXCR7 has a lower expression on the surface of cells; however, has a ten-fold higher affinity to CXCL12 than CXCR411. Moreover, infection and injury may promote the secretion of CXCL12 in specific organs, such as the lung. Therefore, we hypothesize that the overexpression of CXCR7 may have positive effects on mouse MSC (mMSC) proliferation and migration to specific organs.",

Thus, it is necessary to construct MSCs such that the overexpression or suppression of CXCR7 is permanent and stable, as a goal of in vivo treatment. What\u2019s more, we used a very similar approach to address a question in regards to the effects of modulation of the beta-catenin/Wnt pathway in stem cells13. The aim of this study was to construct mMSCs with long-term and stable CXCR7 regulation via lentiviral vector transduction and to evaluate the effects of CXCR7 overexpression on the proliferation and migration of mMSCs as well as the underlying mechanism.",

A concentration gradient of CXCL12 can specifically regulate different effects of chemotaxis in stem cells26\u201328. In a previous study, CXCR4 was considered the unique receptor of CXCL12 and was shown to play an important role in chemotaxis11,29. Balabanian and Burns found that there was another binding site of CXCL12, named RCD1 (CXCR7) in 2006. The affinity of CXCR7 to CXCL12 is 10 times greater than that of CXCR411. However, the lower cell surface expression of CXCR7 than of CXCR4 has seriously restricted the role of the CXCL12/CXCR7 axis on the migration of mMSCs. The present study demonstrates that the overexpression of CXCR7 significantly improved and that the low expression of CXCR7 decreased the proliferation and migratory ability of mMSCs. Additional CXCL12 was added to simulate inflammation microenvironments, which further increased the migratory ability of mMSCs. Our results suggest that the overexpression of CXCR7 have a positive effect on MSC proliferation and migration. However, Liu et al.30 found that CXCR7 was shown to have no influence on MSC migration in renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury models. Gheisari et al.31 found that CXCR7-transfected MSCs were trapped in the lungs, whereas native MSCs home very rarely to kidneys and bone marrow. In addition, the activation of CXCR7 may improve the migration of colorectal cancer cells in the lung but not in the liver9. Thus, it is suspected that MSCs overexpressing CXCR7 may have organ specificity, especially in the lungs.",

To explore the detailed mechanism of increased migration of mMSCs by overexpressing CXCR7, the levels of VCAM-1, CD44, MMP2 and Collagen-I, which are important MSC paracrine factors that regulate the vascular adhesion of MSCs33,34, were measured in the supernatant of transwell chambers. However, VCAM-1, CD44, and MMP2 increased and decreased significantly after overexpression and suppression of CXCR7, respectively. It has been demonstrated that blocking VCAM-1 by its antibody significantly reduced the migration of MSCs28. Further, CD44 and MMP2 play important roles in the migration of MSCs. Thus, this study showed that the increased mMSC secretion of VCAM-1, CD44, and MMP2 is one of the primary mechanisms related to mMSC migration that are promoted by the overexpression of CXCR7.",

Thus, additional CXCL12 was added to the lower chambers of transwell assays to simulate the microenvironment of injured and hypoxic tissues. We found that the overexpression of CXCR7 in mMSCs not only improved their migration and proliferation but also increased their CXCL12 secretion. The mechanism is possibly described based on the following two phenomena. On one hand, more CXCL12 combined with its ligand CXCR7 when CXCR7 was overexpressed in mMSCs, which may have increased the ability of these cells to migrate. The supplemented CXCL12 may combine with more CXCR7 and CXCR4 on mMSCs in a positive feedback loop, which was also reported in Wang\u2019s study37. On the other hand, the high expression of CXCR7 may activate the CXCL12/CXCR7 axis, thus making mMSCs secrete more CXCL12. It was supported by the increasing protein and mRNA level of CXCL12. If true, this would be a novel discovery, however, further study is needed.",
