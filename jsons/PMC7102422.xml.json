Patients with young and old age, Caucasian race, AB blood type, and coexisting medical conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, sickle cell anemia) are at a higher risk of lacking an adequate hemodynamic response and progress to SD. Clinical signs of worsening disease include increasingly severe abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and cold extremities [7, 26, 27]. Hemorrhagic manifestations along the DF spectrum are usually mild, and most commonly consist of scattered tiny petechiae on the skin and, occasionally, the submucosa. Tourniquet test positivity, which signals increased capillary fragility, skin petechiae, and ecchymoses are common findings that appear early in DHF. Epistaxis and gingival bleeding are also common and may be severe. Massive bleeding requiring blood transfusion is less common, usually occurs after the onset of shock, and is most commonly located in the gastrointestinal tract [28].",

In that series, 58.6% of patients who underwent chest CT showed abnormalities; pleural effusion was the major finding, observed in 55% of patients with abnormalities and constituting the sole finding in 35% of those patients [38]. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the most common finding of lung parenchymal involvement, noted in 27.5% of patients, followed by lung consolidation (20.6% of patients). Interlobar septal thickening and airspace nodules with no specific distribution were detected in two (6.82%) patients. No specific axial distribution was observed. The extent of disease in the chest tended to be greater in patients with SD than in those with DF, but this difference was not significant [38].",

Clearing of acute airspace opacities and septal thickening usually occur within 2 weeks in a monophasic episode of pulmonary hemorrhage [44]. Recent publications have described CT findings from isolated cases of pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome associated with DF. The patients presented similar aspects, with extensive areas of consolidation and/or diffuse GGO in both lungs [14, 45, 46].

            "text": "Clinical and radiological distinction between dengue and other infections associated with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage may be challenging. In immunocompetent patients, the most important infectious diseases for differential diagnosis include influenza A (H1N1), leptospirosis, malaria, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) [46, 49\u201351]. A few case reports have described co-infection of those pathogens with dengue virus. All of these conditions can occur in the context of similar epidemiological backgrounds, increasing the challenge of diagnosis [52\u201356]. A pattern of extensive or diffuse GGO and consolidation with a primarily peribronchovascular or subpleural distribution can be strongly related to influenza A (H1N1) infection [46]. Several diagnostic laboratory tests may be used to detect the presence of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens. Real-time RT-PCR has the greatest sensitivity and specificity [46, 51].",

Thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, and plasma leakage are the cornerstones of dengue hemorrhagic fever, but its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Lung alterations are seldom seen in dengue, and imaging findings are probably related to increased vascular permeability. In the febrile phase of illness, the presence of plasma leakage, such as pleural effusion or ascites, may suggest the diagnosis of dengue. Imaging findings in dengue are non-specific and must be distinguished from several other infections that share common presentations, can coexist, and can occur in the same epidemiological setting. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is more frequently related to severe\u2014and often fatal\u2014forms of the disease like dengue hemorrhagic fever. Thoracic imaging findings may show complications and signal potential evolution to severe dengue. Recognition of these findings may help clinicians initiate prompt treatment and prevent mortality.",
