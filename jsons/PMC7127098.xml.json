            "text": "Coccidiosis is an economically important disease in poultry that is caused by several species of Eimeria apicomplexan protozoa that colonize the intestinal mucosa. Infected animals exhibit a variety of clinical manifestations, including inefficient feed utilization, impaired body weight gain, and, in severe cases, mortality [1]. Prophylactic medication has been successfully used to control avian coccidiosis, but alternative strategies are sought due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant parasites in commercial production settings [2], [3]. Although live parasite vaccines have been developed, they pose the risk of unintended infection under the immunosuppressive conditions associated with high-density commercial rearing conditions [4], [5]. As an alternative, noninfectious subunit protein and DNA vaccines have been generated. In particular, subcutaneous immunization of young broiler chickens with a recombinant profilin protein induced high levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production by splenic T cells [6]. Additionally, in ovo vaccination of 18-day-old embryos with DNA plasmids encoding the profilin gene provided partial protection against challenge infection with live Eimeria\n[7]. Profilin is a component of Eimeria parasites that activates Toll-like receptor 11, and is involved in actin-dependent gliding motility, parasite migration across biological barriers, and host cell invasion [8], [9], [10].",

            "text": "In spite of these encouraging results, immunization with recombinant proteins has, in general, shown limited success in stimulating broad-spectrum protective immunity against multiple coccidia species due to their low antigenicity and restricted expression during the parasite life cycle [11], [12]. Coadministration of avian recombinant cytokines as vaccine adjuvants along with Eimeria protein vaccines enhances their immunogenicity [13], [14], [15], [16]. However, cytokine adjuvants are not as effective as conventional veterinary adjuvants and identification of additional immunostimulators for use in commercial poultry vaccination is needed. QCDC is a new adjuvant complex composed of Quil A, cholesterol, dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA) and Carbopol that enhances immune responses against multiple types of vaccines in a variety of veterinary settings [17], [18]. Our prior study demonstrated that broiler chickens immunized subcutaneously with recombinant profilin in combination with QCDC developed partial protection against experimental avian coccidiosis compared with animals given profilin alone [18]. Because in ovo vaccination of chickens is currently used in commercial production facilities and offers the advantages of inducing early and heightened immunity compared with post-hatch immunization [19], [20], the present study was conducted to evaluate the adjuvant effect of QCDC during embryo vaccination with profilin against avian coccidiosis.",

The eggs were injected with 100 \u03bcl containing sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), QCDC alone, profilin alone (50 \u03bcg), or profilin (50 \u03bcg) plus QCDC using the Intelliject system (AviTech, Easton, MD) (Fig. 1\n). The final concentrations of QCDC components used alone or with profilin were 12.0 \u03bcg/ml of Quil A (E.M. Sergeant Pulp & Chemical Co., Clifton, NJ), 12.0 \u03bcg/ml of cholesterol (FabriChem, Trumbull, CT), 0.6 \u03bcg/ml of DDA (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), and 0.75 mg/ml of Carbopol\u00ae 974P (Lubrizol, Wickliffe, OH). In brief, each egg was cleaned and positioned in a holder under the injection needle with the large end on top. With the help of a vacuum system, the needle penetrated the shell past the air cell, delivered the inoculum into the amniotic cavity and was disinfected after each inoculation. In addition, the system was designed to avoid creating negative pressure inside of the egg, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination [12]. At 3 days post-immunization, the chickens were hatched and provided with feed and water ad libitum. Chickens were kept in brooder pens in an Eimeria-free facility for 7 days post-hatch and transferred into large hanging cages (2 birds/cage) at a separate location where they were infected with Eimeria maxima and kept until the end of the experimental period. All experiments were performed according to guidelines established by the Beltsville Agriculture Research Center Small Animal Care Committee.",

Five micrograms of total RNA were treated with 1.0 U of DNase I and 1.0 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 reaction buffer (Sigma) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. One \u03bcl of stop solution was added to inactivate DNase I and the mixture was heated at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the StrataScript first-strand synthesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitative RT-PCR oligonucleotide primers for chicken interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-15, and IFN-\u03b3 and the GAPDH internal control are listed in Table 1\n. Amplification and detection were carried out using equivalent amounts of total RNA using the Mx3000P system and Brilliant SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Stratagene). Standard curves were generated using log10 diluted standard RNA and the levels of individual transcripts were normalized to those of GAPDH by the Q-gene program [25]. Each sample was analysed in triplicate. To normalize individual replicates, the logarithmic-scaled threshold cycle (C\nt) values were transformed to linear units of normalized expression prior to calculating means and SEM for the references and individual targets, followed by the determination of mean normalized expression using the Q-gene program [18], [26], [27], [28].",

In our previous in vivo study, chickens immunized post-hatch with profilin plus QCDC showed increased body weight gain following E. acervulina infection compared with animals given PBS or profilin alone [18]. However, subcutaneous immunization with profilin alone or with profilin plus QCDC did not affect fecal oocyst output compared with PBS controls, and the levels of intestinal mRNAs for IL-1\u03b2, IL-15, and IFN-\u03b3 were equal in the profilin alone and profilin/QCDC groups. In the current study, we sought to determine whether in ovo immunization with profilin plus QCDC would provide beneficial effects on post-infection weight gain, oocyst shedding, and cytokine expression, as well as to extend the analysis to E. maxima, another parasite species common to commercial production facilities. Our results demonstrated that vaccination with profilin plus QCDC increased chicken body weight gain compared with the profilin- and QCDC-only groups, such that it was equal to the uninfected controls. Immunization with profilin plus QCDC also reduced oocyst output compared with unimmunized controls, although in this case QCDC failed to provide an adjuvant effect since no difference was observed between the profilin-only and profilin/QCDC groups. Finally, animals given profilin plus QCDC had increased intestinal levels of transcripts encoding IL-1\u03b2, IL-15 and IFN-\u03b3 compared with the profilin-only or with the QCDC-only groups. The reason why profilin plus QCDC had no significant effect on parasite shedding compared with profilin alone is unclear, but this observation is in agreement with published reports indicating the absence of a correlation between Eimeria-induced body weight loss and fecal oocyst shedding [26], [29].",

In this regard, the importance of cell-mediated immunity in conferring protection against avian coccidiosis is well documented [18], [24], [28], [39] and other studies have verified a beneficial role of cell-mediated immunity for gut proinflammatory, Th1 and Th2 cytokines following Eimeria infection [39], [40], [41], [42].
