Sputum was obtained by spontaneous expectoration or suctioning the posterior nasopharynx with a sterile catheter connected to a specimen trap, taking care to avoid suctioning the anterior nasal content. After specimen collection, the suction catheter was flushed with 5 mL of sterile saline to evacuate any residual specimen. Initially, an IS specimen was collected only from case patients with suspected tuberculosis, but from April 2010, all case patients underwent sputum induction. IS specimens were investigated by microscopy, bacterial culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and, if clinically indicated, mycobacterial culture. We assessed the quality of the sputum specimens using the Bartlett score by microscopically evaluating the Gram stain smear [8]. The number of squamous epithelial cells per low-power field was graded (<10, 10\u201325, and >25 cells were scored 0, \u22121, and \u22122, respectively), as was the presence of leukocytes (>25, 10\u201325, and <10 leukocytes were scored 2, 1 and 0, respectively). The presence of mucus was scored as 1, and an absence of mucus as 0. A total score \u22651 was considered to indicate good quality. Isolates were considered potentially causative if they were found to be predominant on the Gram stain or on the culture plate over other organisms. Ziehl-Neelsen stained concentrated sputum smears were examined for acid-fast bacilli and cultured for mycobacteria using the Bactec MIGT 960 system (BD Diagnostics) [9]. The presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in acid-fast bacilli\u2013positive cultures was confirmed by the Genotype MTBC assay (Hain Lifescience).",

Continuous data were compared by t test. Agreement between pathogen detection by multiplex PCR using different specimen types was assessed using the \u03ba statistic. To estimate the strength of association of pathogen detection with disease severity, odds ratios were calculated comparing case patients and controls (those with and those without URTI) by multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age group (<6 , 6\u201335 , or \u226536 months) and season (dry season: November 1 through April 30). Where it was not possible to perform logistic regression because the cell value was 0, Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to estimate the significance of the association. Etiology was categorized as bacterial if a bacterial pathogen was isolated from blood culture, a predominant bacterial pathogen was identified from IS culture, the serum specimens were positive for M. pneumoniae or B. pertussis, or the PCR results were positive for M. pneumoniae; viral if the IS, NPS, or OPS specimen had PCR results positive for a viral pathogen; mixed if both a bacterium and a virus were identified; or unknown. Another model of etiology was created that only included pathogens significantly associated with case status in the case-control analysis.

Serological testing provided a diagnosis in 6 case patients (5.7%) in whom all other tests were negative. Confirmed or probable B. pertussis infection was identified in 10 case patients (4 of whom were \u22642 months of age and all of whom were \u22647 months of age; vaccination status unknown). The case-control analysis suggested an association between serological detection of RSV and admission with SP or VSP (Table 3).

In this study, we explored the diagnostic utility of collecting an IS specimen. Although sputum assessment criteria have not been rigorously evaluated in children, the vast majority of specimens were of good quality according to standard criteria. Using a conservative definition of culture positivity, a potential bacterial pathogen was identified in IS cultures more than twice as often as blood cultures, and PCR of IS specimens identified a potential viral pathogen in more than half of case patients.

Our findings differ from those of a matched case-control study of 680 children in Nepal, in which RSV, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1\u20134, and human metapneumovirus were all associated with pneumonia to varying degrees [17]. However, the Nepal study involved outpatients, of whom 652 (95.9%) had nonsevere pneumonia. A study of hospitalized children with pneumonia in rural Alaska found that rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronaviruses were detected in similar proportions of case patients and outpatient controls, but RSV, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and influenza viruses were estimated to have caused 17%, 10%, 14%, and 4% of hospitalized pneumonia cases, respectively [18]. In our study, only RSV was found to be associated with hospitalization for pneumonia; similar results have been reported from this area previously [12]. The analysis presented in Figure 1 illustrates the essential need for controls in this type of study; the assessment of etiology shifts from predominantly viral to predominantly bacterial if case attribution is restricted to those pathogens associated with hospitalization in the case-control analysis. For pathogens with small effect size and low prevalence, a larger study is needed to assess likely causation. Quantifying the viral genome may prove useful for linking detections with disease [19].",

The poor correlation may be related to a variety of factors, including poor immune responses to certain infections in young children or inadequate time elapsed between acute and convalescent sampling. Alternatively, it may reflect the nonspecificity of pathogen detection in the upper respiratory tract as a diagnostic marker of SP or VSP.

            "text": "This study has several limitations. A stepwise introduction of sampling methods was used as the clinical capacity for specimen collection and laboratory capacity increased. Our assessment of pneumonia etiology (shown in Figure 1) should not be taken as a definitive study of etiology in Kilifi, because the full sampling algorithm was not implemented until the second quarter of the year and complete sampling was only available in one-third of the case patients. Indeed, the results illustrate the potential variability of etiology depending on the sampling methods used. Lung aspirates and postmortem studies were not performed. The case-control analysis was limited to a comparison of results from NPS specimens and serological testing; we could not assess the association between pathogen detection from other nonsterile site specimens and pneumonia hospitalization. We did not collect information on the duration of symptoms in case patients and controls, and it is possible that the high prevalence of viral detection in controls was related to illness in the recent past. Among case patients with VSP, 14% had malaria parasitemia and more than one-third were not given a diagnosis of pneumonia at the time of discharge. This is not unexpected, given that the World Health Organization case definition is deliberately nonspecific in order to be sensitive. In hospital settings, the specificity of the case definition for SP and VSP could probably be improved through the use of chest radiography, which will be a component of the PERCH study.",

Although lung aspirates and postmortem studies were not performed in our pilot, it is recognized that these are critical to a better understanding of pneumonia etiology and fatal pneumonia in children, and the PERCH study will incorporate these procedures in selected sites [21]. The pilot study found that the collection of IS specimens was accepted by parents, well tolerated, feasible for use in a rural developing world setting, and provided useful diagnostic information; IS specimens will be collected from all case patients without contraindications. Although infectious serological testing is used with decreasing frequency in the molecular era, this type of test provided etiological information and may be helpful in the interpretation of associations between detection of a pathogen in the URT and pneumonia. If necessary, home visits will be conducted to increase the collection of convalescent serum specimens. The community accepted the recruitment and sampling of controls. For PERCH, specimens from controls will be expanded to include OPS, blood, and urine specimens (in addition to NPS specimens), to maximize the ability to detect associations between pathogen detection and hospitalization with pneumonia. Using a comprehensive approach, the PERCH study will be well-positioned to provide definitive information about the etiology of SP and VSP in children in the developing world.",
