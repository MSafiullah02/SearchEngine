We employ 24-hours daily average temperature, daily new confirmed cases of a covid-19 in Wuhan, and RMB exchange rate to represent the weather, covid-19 outbreak, and Chinese economy, respectively. The methodology of Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) is used to analyze the daily data collected from 21 st January 2020 to 31 st March 2020. Results reveal significant coherence between series at different time-frequency combinations. Overall results show the insignificance of an increase in temperature to contain new covid-19 infections. The Renminbi exchange rate showed a negative coherence at specific time-frequency spots suggesting a negative but limited impact of the covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan on the Chinese export economy. Our results are contrary to many earlier studies, which show a significant impact of increased temperature in slowing down covid-19 spread. These results can have important implications for economic and containment policy making regarding the covid-19 outbreak.",

The first case was reported in China's Wuhan during December 2019, and a statement from WHO confirmed the novel nature of the virus on 9 th January 2020 (Zhu et al., 2020) . Within the same month, WHO declared public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 29 th January 2020, citing concerns for the response capacity of countries with weaker health systems (Sohrabi et al., 2020) . Due to the highly contagious nature of covid-19 (R 0 =2-5) and an ever-increasing number of cases in other parts of the world, soon it became a pandemic (Liu, Gayle, Wilder-Smith, & Rockl\u00f6v, 2020) . The total number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide amount to 2,127,873 and 141,454 respectively at 04:33 hours Beijing time on 17 th April 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. A recent study in Madrid suggests that covid-19 may become more contagious along time, implying that R 0 may increase (Garcia-Iglesias & de Cos Juez, 2020) . The health impact is severe enough to put more than half of the world's total population under some form of restric tion, while the economic impact is being called worse than the 2008-09 global financial crisis and compared with the Great Depression of 1930. Stock markets around the world have seen a worse decline for decades (Baker et al., 2020) . Researchers across the globe are struggling to document the nascent knowledge acquired through primary J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f observation and experience of the situation. Efforts on a global scale are being made to know more about this virus and to slow down and ultimately stop the spread of this menace. Figure 1 shows the daily time trend of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city.",

In this scenario, the negative economic impact of this disease is imminent, especially in the country where it was reported first (China) and which is also amongst the worst affected (82,341infected and 3,352 dead till 17 th April 2020). As China is a production house of the world and a major portion of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) depends on exports, the Renminbi (RMB, Chinese currency) exchange rate is expected to be also affected (Feng, Li, & Swenson, 2016) . Due to lockdown in Hubei (Central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital), the movement of people and goods to and from this place was completely halted. Due to the novel nature of covid-19, it became difficult to ascertain if the virus could be spread through goods transport or not. In this uncertainty, other countries felt reluctant to allow Chinese made products to enter their borders. Production had already suffered due to complete lockdown in a whole province and then reduced demand overseas added further to declining exports in China. All these factors can affect the exchange rate of RMB, which is primarily linked to foreign trade flows (Li, Ma, & Xu, 2015) . In such a scenario, it is interesting to know how the Chinese RMB exchange rate moved with the emerging situation of the covid-19 outbreak, explicitly speaking the number of new daily confirmed cases in Wuhan during this period. Figure 4 shows the daily time trend of the RMB exchange rate against USD. This study attempts to document the relationship between local weather (Temperature), economy (Exchange rate of RMB), and covid-19 outbreak (Daily number of new confirmed covid-19 cases) in the Chinese city of Wuhan where it was first reported, using wavelet analysis. As it is an emerging situation, the research on different aspects of this global outbreak is still naive at the moment.",

Temperature is an important factor in infectivity reduction of the human coronavirus (Lamarre & Talbot, 1989) . Experience with SARS had demonstrated that the disease disappeared in warm weather during late July (Wallis & Nerlich, 2005) . Similar behavior has been expected by some in the case of covid-19, also due to its relationship with the same family i.e., corona-virus (Wilder-Smith, Chiew, & Lee, 2020). Temperature and humidity is an important factor in the survival of coronavirus on metal and other surfaces (Casanova, Jeon, Rutala, Weber, & Sobsey, 2010) . Higher humidity, lower temperature and tropical areas were found to be more feasible for the coronavirus spread during SARS outbreak (Chan et al., 2011) . A recent study finds an association between meteorological factors, air pollutants and number of deaths in Wuhan during covid-19 outbreak using the Generalized Additive Model (Ma et al., 2020) . Weather is found to be associated with the daily number of covid-19 cases in the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta also (Tosepu et al., 2020) . Research studies on the SARS outbreak found that daily infections could increase as higher as 18.18 times at low temperatures as compared to high temperatures (Merlo et al., 2006) . A study involving 429 cities around the world suggests that temperature may be an important factor in covid-19 infection and transmission and regions with similar weather conditions as of Wuhan should be extra cautious in preventing an outbreak . The same study suggests that there may be the best temperature for covid-19 transmission and low temperature is more feasible for this infection and transmission. Another research, including data from all cities of China suggests that increase in temperature leads to increase in doubling time of covid-19. This implies that high temperatures may reduce the speed of transmission of covid-19. Although the model from this study explains only 18% of the variation in doubling time of covid-19 cases, it still provides an important insight into how temperature can play a role in the containment of this outbreak (Oliveiros, Caramelo, Ferreira, & Caramelo, 2020 ). While the above mentioned studies suggest a decisive role of increased temperature in reducing covid-19 spread, the current spread around southern hemisphere suggests there may be only little if any role of temperature in this regard. According to research on global scale, high temperature does not seem to slow down the covid-19 spread (Jamil, Alam, Gojobori, & Duarte, 2020) . Another study on community outbreaks J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f throughout the world suggests that covid-19 is a seasonal respiratory virus, spreading along similar latitude (Sajadi et al., 2020) .",

The Chinese economy is export-oriented, and significant changes in exports due to covid-19 can affect its exchange rate.
