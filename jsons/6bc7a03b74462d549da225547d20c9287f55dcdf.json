Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5~20, 20~40 and greater than 40 (nW\uff65 \u22122 \uff65 \u22121 ) [1], respectively. We found that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage.",

Coincident with the Chinese spring festival migration, cases quickly spread across the whole country. Despite China's effective efforts in containing the outbreak since late January, within about three months, COVID-19 has been found in 185 countries, and taken more than 162 thousand lives. Worldwide, more than two million cases have been confirmed by the second half of April 2020, and the number is still growing rapidly. Wuhan City was locked down on Jan. 23, 2020, as soon as the outbreak and contagious nature of the novel coronavirus was confirmed. In ten days, most of the provinces in Mainland China implemented strict policies to limit non-essential activities, transportation and production. Hundreds of millions of people volunteered to stay at home and practice self-isolation. Consequently, drastic changes suddenly took place in everyone's lives, influencing their work and living environments.",

However, the pandemic situation is still severe and grim in the other parts of the world; there are more than 700,000 confirmed cases in the U.S., as of April 18, 2020. A detailed and quantitative analysis of the impact of COVID-19 has had on people's lives, activities and the environment, as well as the citizens' response to the policies enacted to control the disease in China is urgent and significantly important for the reference of other countries. Studies and analytics have been conducted to estimate, assess and predict the spread of this pandemic using temperature [2, 3] , humidity [4, 5] , air quality [6] , geometry [7] and migration data [8] , and how the control measures impact the outbreak [9] . But very few published articles in the scientific literature illustrate the impact of virus mitigation and containment measures on the environment. Our study aims to fill this gap because understanding the impact of COVID-19 is important for decision making in regards to post-pandemic reopening strategies, economic loss assessments and environment regulations.",

Night Time Light (NTL) images have the capability to not only tell people where the facilities are, but also depict when and how they are used. Therefore, the citizens' reaction to the lockdown and quarantine policies can be reflected and monitored. NASA has released some comparisons between the NTL imagery before and during the lockdown of Wuhan [14] , and has demonstrated that some districts and highways are visually dimming, attributed to the COVID-19 shutdown. However, there are no quantitative statistics regarding exactly which area are less bright. Some questions remain to be answered, such as: Are all the parts of the city getting dimmer? Are the conditions similar in other provinces? Could some areas stay the same or even get brighter at night? Answers to these questions are crucial in understanding the changes in policydriven patterns caused by the pandemic, which in turn is important for analyzing the influence of COVID-19 and decision making on the response methods. To answer these questions, this study first calculates and compares the monthly average NTL radiance values before and during the pandemic for each province, then categorizes them into three classes: (1) residential areas, (2) transportation facilities and urban infrastructures, and (3) commercial centers, and finally analyzes the change of Number Of Pixels (NOP) in each category. Spatiotemporal analytics on average NTL is also conducted to achieve a better comprehension of the impact. Through these categorizations and investigations, the influence of COVID-19 on human activities can be efficiently depicted.",

It was reported to influence the mortality outcome of COVID-19 [15] , researchers found that an increase of only 1 \u03bcg/ 3 in 2.5 is associated with a 15% increase in the death rate. [6] studied the association between meteorological factors and COVID-19 transmission and illustrated that bad air quality with strong wind will accelerate the spread of the virus. On the other hand, the pandemic situation also impacts the air quality indirectly. Both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have observed plummets in airborne Nitrogen Dioxide ( 2 ) over China using modified Copernicus Sentinel 5P data [16, 17] . Moreover, [18] illustrated that the outbreak of COVID-19 has forced China to enact lockdown procedures, suppressing its industrial activities and, hence, dropped its 2 and carbon emissions by 30% and 25%, respectively. All of these discoveries focused on the change of one or two pollutants induced by COVID-19, but the total air quality cannot be determined without the consideration of other air pollutants, such as Sulfur Dioxide ( 2 ), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone and particulate matters (PMs). Our study investigates the ground-based air quality index (AQI), which has been derived from the concentration of five major air pollutants before and during the COVID-19 crisis for every province in mainland China and offers a better vision of the COVID-19 impact on the overall air quality.",

These data have been corrected for clouds, atmospheric conditions, terrain, vegetation, snow, lunar illumination, and stray light effects, using the Black Marble algorithm [19] and gridded to 500 meters globally. The VIIRS/DNB has substantial improvements in sensor resolution and calibration to guarantee fewer over-glow and saturation effects when compared to the previous era of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System's (DMSP/OLS) nighttime lights image products. The VIIRS/DNB has a spectral range of 500-900 nm that is highly sensitive to very low levels of visible light and can significantly improve the ability to detect anthropogenic lighting from buildings, roads, and other city infrastructures at night without moonlight influence [20] . The cloud masks associated with NTL imagery are performed using the VIIRS thermal band (band M15) with a spectral range of 10.26-11.26 \u03bcm [21] .

In order to analyze these changes on human activities, this paper categorizes the NTL radiances into three classes according to the brightness values, effectively reflecting the different anthropogenic functional zones, including residential areas, transportation and public facilities, and commercial centers. Previous research adopted NTL radiance thresholds to identify these regions [25, 26, 27, 28] . [1] investigated the pixel-level relationship between the VIIRS DNBderived NTL, Landsat-derived land-use/land-cover, and a map of point of interest (POI) density over China, especially the artificial surfaces in urban land. According to their results, 5~20, 20~40 and greater than 40 (nW\uff65 \u22122 \uff65 \u22121 ) are appropriate radiance ranges for residential areas, transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, respectively. Figure 1 shows the average NTL radiance for every province and all of China. During January and February 2020, COVID-19 broke out across China, and most provinces implemented strict quarantine policies, resulting in the majority of people spending their time at home. The average artificial NTL radiance levels during this period are much lower than December 2019 in most provinces, except for Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Xizang and Qinghai, where the crisis is not severe, with 194, 76, 1 and 18 cases respectively. Additionally, the NTL of these provinces prior to the outbreak is not bright compared to the other provinces. With the reopening of most provinces in March 2020, the average NTL brightness has increased in comparison to January and February. However, exceptions to this have been observed in Hubei province, with its capital city Wuhan being the center of the outbreak, and several other provinces near it that contain larger numbers of confirmed cases, such as Hunan (1019 cases), Jiangxi (937 cases) and Guangdong (1585 cases). For the national level (chart in the lower right corner), a decreasing trend can be found from December 2019 to February 2020. Although the average NTL brightness almost recovered in March, the value is still a little lower than December's. The reopening was carried out in steps and hadn't been totally completed by the end of March in some of the provinces mentioned above, influencing the average of NTL for the whole country. For the 5~20 nW\u00b7 \u22122 \u00b7 \u22121 category, indicative of residential areas, 20 provinces have higher NOP in all three of the studied months of 2020 than in December 2019. Only Xingjiang in January, and Chongqing, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Xinjiang in March have decreasing numbers larger than 10,000. All the negative differences are smaller than 10,000 in February, when the crisis was most rigorous. These spatiotemporal patterns are due to the stay-at-home policies and more people spending their nights at home.",

Although most cities have reopened and loosened their restrictive policies, people are still cautious to gather in crowds, and most shopping malls are closing earlier in the evenings.

We can observe that these regions are dimmer during the lockdown, in February 2020, compared to December 2019. The differences also show mostly negative values in these two circles. Contrastingly, residential areas outside of the commercial centers are brighter in January, and the differences are obviously positive in those regions. However, the pixels on highways and main roads are not clearly getting brighter or dimmer, they tend to show a mixed texture. This phenomenon can also be verified in the difference map (Figure 3(c) ). Figure 3 (d) is the NOP difference in the three categories between the first three months of 2020 and December 2019 (the former minus latter). For all the months during the city lockdown, there are significantly more pixels in the residential category and less pixels in the commercial centers than before. The number of transportation and public facilities lights decreased in January and March while increasing in February. Besides the explanations that have already been discussed, in February, large amounts of food, living and medical resources were transported to Wuhan from all over China and some other countries around the world; national and private medical teams volunteered to support and traveled to Wuhan through highways and airports; temporary hospitals such as Huoshenshan and Leishenshan were built rapidly. Consequently, the NOP in this category is higher during February than December. ",

The activity ranges of citizens among different functional zones changed dramatically due to the COVID-19 related policies. The CBD and commercial centers became less bright in the NTL images and residential regions lit up. Most people followed the instructions and suggestions of the government and health department strictly to fight against the crisis and protect themselves. Although these changes and impacts bring unprecedented inconvenience to people's daily lives and work, the spread of COVID-19 was initially controlled in about two months. This gives an efficient reference for the rest of the world to make their own policies, strategies and decisions regarding how to control the spread of the virus. Since people stayed at home for nearly two months, some of their consumption and working habits have changed. For example, more people will be accustomed to online purchases and working from home, which will influence economic structures and the incomes of retailers. It has already been proven that NTL has a close relationship with the economy [34, 35] ; it should be used in the investigation of post-pandemic socioeconomic situations.",

Instead, most people stayed at home, in the residential areas. These changes in human activity are reflected in the statistical results of the NTL categorization:",

The air pollution of most provinces is less severe in February and March than January, especially for the Northeast, Northwest, east coast and central China. The reduction of many non-essential industries and private vehicles are the main reasons for the better air quality. Although Wuhan began its lockdown on Jan. 23, 2020, all other cities were still open until the first week of February. The pollutant emissions from the industries and vehicles did not change much during January. Exceptions can be found in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan and Guizhou where the air quality became worse in February and March. For these provinces, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are relatively small, totally 78, 18, 139, 184 and 147, respectively, as of Apr.",
