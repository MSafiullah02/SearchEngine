The stressor factors suggested included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.",

            "text": "Although outdoor activities are typically more available, varied, and have more facilities and infrastructures to perform any type of physical exercise, there still are many possibilities for exercising at home during a quarantine. Clearly, we would support the message of \"doing at least some exercise is better than nothing\", however, a more precise prescription and recommendation are needed to guarantee an appropriate exercise program aimed to maintain or improve the principal healthrelated physical fitness components. Briefly, the reason to promote PA and exercise for improving physical fitness components is that these (cardiorespiratory fitness or CRF, muscular strength, coordinationagility) are directly related with the physiological functions of the main organ systems (respiratory, circulatory, muscular, nervous and skeletal systems) and indirectly implicated in the appropriate functioning of other systems (endocrine, digestive, immune or renal systems). [1] [2] [3] [4] 7, 9 These relationships are even more interesting from the point of view of physiologic functional reserve of organ systems, for example, to increase the CRF is not only directly related with improvements in the circulatory and respiratory systems capacities but also with increases in its functional reserve. For all this, PA/exercise become especially essential for older people during quarantine because to maintain physiological function and reserve of most of the organ systems Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases xxx (xxxx) xxx could contribute to the fight against the mental and physical consequences and severity of Covid-19 (Fig 1) .",
