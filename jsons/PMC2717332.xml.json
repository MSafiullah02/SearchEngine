            "text": "The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) is a major virion structural protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1,2). It has 422 amino-acid residues, a molecular weight of 46 kDa, and shares 20\u201330% homology with the NP of other coronaviruses (1,2). Its major function is to assemble the viral RNA genome of coronavirus to form the helical ribonucleoprotein core. In vitro, the NPs, in the absence of genomic nucleic acid, exist as dimers at a low concentration, and may form higher oligomers at higher concentrations (3). The NP does not have any cysteine residues, thus it contains no disulfide bond, and may be less stable than other structural proteins of SARS-CoV. Experiments showed that it is most stable at pH 9.0 (3). Thermal and chemical denaturant-induced denaturation analysis (3) showed that the unfolding and refolding of oligomeric NP can be described by a two-state model. Chemical unfolding is found to be reversible (3,4), while both irreversibility (3) and reversibility (4) of the thermal-induced unfolding in different buffers have been reported. Recently, Wang et al. (4) reported that the NP in phosphate-buffered saline buffer starts to unfold at 35\u00b0C and is completely denatured at 55\u00b0C. The stability of the NP is critical for the function of the SARS virus, which is completely noninfectious at \u223c56\u00b0C (5).",

(6) found that the NP consists of two independent structural domains\u2014the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) (residues 45\u2013181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (DD) (residues 248\u2013365), surrounded by flexible linkers. Fig. 1 shows a model for the overall structure of SARS-CoV NP (6). The two structural domains carry out two distinct functions. The N-terminal domain is able to bind RNA, while the C-terminal domain acts as a dimerization domain. Hsieh et al. (7) showed that the DD could also bind to an RNA packing signal, and Chen et al. (8) proposed an octamer model (note that the structure of the octamer can be accessed at the Protein Data Bank, PDB code: 2CJR) to demonstrate a possible framework for helical packing of viral RNA. Whereas the two structural domains do not interact with each other, they could act in concert to carry out biological functions with the aid of the long flexible linker between the two domains (6). In this context, two structural domains are logical candidates for further studies. We then investigated the thermostability of the two domains separately, instead of using the full-length of the NP. In this article, we focus on studying the RBD, and the study of the DD domain will be reported elsewhere.",

An additional 21 residues have been added to the N-terminal in the structure determination, so there is a total of 158 residues in this PDB structure, in which residues 22\u2013158 correspond to residues 45\u2013181 of the SARS-CoV NP. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate that the RBD has a five-stranded \u03b2-sheet, and all residues are solvent-exposed (6), which implies that it is essentially a loosely packed protein. We studied the thermostability of the RBD by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (11,12), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. Our experiments show that the transition midpoint of thermal denaturation of the RBD at pH 6.8 is 48.74\u00b0C, and the transition curve of the RBD can be fitted nicely with a two-state model. Further, NMR spectroscopy experiments conducted under equilibrium condition suggests that the N-terminus folds last at low temperature and unfolds first at high temperature. The remaining four \u03b2-sheets in the (un)folding process are highly cooperative.",

From the double-minimum structure of the free energy, plotted as a function of the number of native contacts, we conclude that the RBD is indeed a two-state folder. The reversibility of thermal folding of RBD was theoretically investigated by considering folding and unfolding pathways of five \u03b2-strands.

The fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells overnight at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Broth media without inducing agents. For purification, 10 amino-acid residues (MHHHHHHAMG) have been added to the N-terminal of RBD as His-tag, such that the final RBD sample has a total of 147 amino-acid residues, in which residues 11\u2013147 correspond to residues 45\u2013181 of the SARS-CoV NP. The protein was purified with Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 7 M urea. The protein was then allowed to refold by gradually lowering the denaturant concentration through dialysis in liquid chromatography buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.4). Renatured protein was loaded onto an AKTA-EXPLORER fast performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added to the purified protein.

Final sample concentration was \u223c1.5 mM. Variable temperature 15N-edited heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were acquired on a Bruker AV600 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a normal temperature probe. Spectra were acquired using spectral widths of 12 ppm \u00d7 34 ppm and 1024 \u00d7 128 complex points for the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. The sample was allowed to equilibrate at the target temperature for at least 30 min before experiments were conducted. These spectra were processed with iNMR (Nucleomatica, Molfetta, Italy), which was also used to extract peak intensities. Graphs were generated with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Projection-reconstruction three-dimensional HNCO spectra were acquired on a Bruker AV500 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe.

Spectra were processed with TopSpin 2.1 (Bruker) and the reconstructed spectra were analyzed with CARA (18). Digital resolution on the 13C dimension after processing was 0.046 ppm. Secondary shifts were calculated from the random coil shifts tabulated by Schwarzinger et al. (19,20), and corrected for sequence composition (19,20).

In this overdamped limit, we use the Euler method for integration and the time step \u0394t = 0.1\u03c4L.

The thermal unfolding pathways may be probed using a similar progressive variable, but instead of folding times we use unfolding ones, i.e., \u03b4i = t/\u03c4iU, where \u03c4iU values are unfolding times.

Increased tumbling of the molecule results in stronger peak intensities, whereas increased exchange rate lowers the intensities. When the temperature is raised, both the tumbling rate and exchange rates increase. Residues that are involved in hydrogen bonding, e.g., secondary structure formation, usually have slower exchange rates and are less prone to lose intensity when the temperature is raised. Thus, a plot of peak intensities versus temperature provides a qualitative view of the (un)folding process under equilibrium conditions. Such a plot for the RBD is shown in Fig. 6 for the \u03b2-sheet residues. The residues comprising the \u03b2-sheet fall into three categories: Q59 (numbered according to the full length of NP), which shows extreme loss of intensity even at moderate temperatures; T58 and Y110, which lose intensity at an intermediate rate; and the rest, which lose intensity only at higher temperatures. Our results suggest that the \u03b21 strand, which includes T58 and Q59, has a lower thermal stability compared to the other strands in the \u03b2-sheet. Thus, the strand \u03b21 likely unfolds first and folds last in the (un)folding process. The fact that most residues exhibit a transition at approximately the same temperature implies a high degree of cooperativity of the (un)folding process.",

We opted to observe only the carbonyl shifts because it employs a highly sensitive experiment and is sensitive to both the \u03b1- and \u03b2-structures. Positive values imply \u03b1-propensity, whereas negative values imply \u03b2-propensity. We carried out this experiment at three different temperatures with the results summarized in Fig. 6. Attempts to conduct the experiments at higher temperature were not feasible due to low signal/noise ratio. In this experiment, Y110 shows marginal \u03b2-propensity across all temperatures tested. Coupled with the results shown in Fig. 7, it seems that Y110 could serve as a starting point for (un)folding of the \u03b22/\u03b23/\u03b24 sheet. Surprisingly, a number of residues located at the \u03b22 (Y87, Y88, and R89) and \u03b24 (I131 and W133) strands showed non-beta propensities at the temperatures tested.

Identifying this value with the experimental value TM = 321.9 K we obtained the characteristic energy in our model \u025bH = 0.73 kcal/mol. The simulated temperature dependence of Cp (Fig. 8 a) is shown in the same temperature interval as for the experimental curve in Fig. 3.

The thermal unfolding of the full-length NP was studied by fluorescence technique that monitors primarily the structural changes at the vicinities of the five tryptophan residues, three located in the RBD domain and two in the DD domain. Thus, the results are the composite effects of the melting of the two domains and as such, the observed melting is broad. The observed lower TM for the NP also suggests that the DD appears to be less stable and more crucial to the properties of the NP, and predominantly determines the stability of the framework of the DD octamer (8) in forming helical ribonucleoprotein core. The RBD and DD do not interact with each other. It is unclear how the two domains contribute to the high irreversibility. This issue requires further investigation.",

The G\u014d model by itself can not be employed to ascertain the two-state behavior of proteins. However, one can use it in conjunction with experiments to probe the two-state folding because this model does not always provide the two-state behavior as have been clearly shown in the work of Clementi et al. (14). It can capture intermediates that occur due to topological constraints but not those emerging from the frustration of the contact interactions. Although the folding process in the G\u014d model is less cooperative compared to what observed experimentally, we have obtained good estimates for other thermodynamic quantities. Given the simplicity of the G\u014d modeling, our theoretical results should be considered as reasonable. In the future, it is of interest to simulate RBD with all-atom models (34\u201338) to see whether such simulated results can be more cooperative. In addition, our present simulations show that the folding of the RBD initiates from the core and the N-terminus folds last. Our NMR spectroscopy experiment conducted under equilibrium conditions suggests that the N-terminus unfolds first and folds last, while the (un)folding of remaining \u03b2-strands is highly cooperative. Due to the sensitivity of the solution pH and hydrogen exchange rate with respect to temperature variations, our analysis based on the NMR data for the folding sequence of the remaining four \u03b2-strands has a limited resolution.",
