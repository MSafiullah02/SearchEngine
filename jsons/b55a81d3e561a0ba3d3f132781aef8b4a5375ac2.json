The virus outbreak provoked public fear, which resulted in a mass reduction in transit use in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). Its effect differed among socioeconomic groups and geographical areas. A typical way to analyze this is to associate individual reactions to the disaster with socioeconomic characteristics. However, a more structured approach, which considers behavioral characteristics resulting from the societal position of an individual, would identify the basic reason for such associations. The study hypothesized that the degree of fixity that individuals have in their daily life may elucidate these associations. When fear is prevalent, people having the flexibility to change their lifestyle will make more changes in daily activities and travels. The study examined the influence of public fear of a pandemic disease on travel behavior and the effect of life fixity on individual response to the fear. To this end, smart card data of transit use and changes in travel behavior during the MERS period were examined. The study found that fear was powerful and influenced travel behavior differently depending on life fixity levels and regional characteristics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "On May 20, 2015, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak was reported in South Korea. The disease is a viral respiratory illness that is new to humans and can cause the development of severe acute respiratory illness (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015) , with a death rate of nearly 20%. Fear of the disease was prevalent in South Korea, particularly in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), which is a high-density populated area with more than 20 million people. The fear was pandemic, and people refrained from normal daily activities such as going out. The first patient affected by the disease was reported by the news media to the public on May 20, 2015, and the number of patients increased every day. The central government did not release information on the hospitals treating the affected patients to the public (Newsweek, 2015) . Fear exponentially grew among the citizens because the disease was known to be contagious, and the hospitals where the patients were being treated were not known by the public. Dozens of new patients affected by the disease were identified, and the number of people who self-quarantined to avoid exposure to the disease exceeded 1,000 on June 3, 2015. The central government of South Korea officially released information on the (potentially) affected hospitals on June 7, 2015. However, fear was already widespread, and there were concerns about the possibility of community infection. The pandemic level was gradually reduced toward the end of June since the number of those isolated was greatly reduced around the middle of June.

Although the disease was proven to be not very contagious at the community level, disaster management should take into account not only the effect of the disease in a medical context but also the effect of fear.

Choi et al. (2014) studied the influence of social changes on travel behavior in South Korea. They analyzed household travel survey data over eight years from 2002 to 2010 and found that the temporal and spatial characteristics of changes in travel behavior were associated with socioeconomic or regional characteristics and travel characteristics. Elias et al. (2013) studied the factors that affect travel behavior when there are terror threats. They used an ordered logit model showing that fear and risk perception are important for understanding travel when under terror threats in two cities in Israel. Women were found to be more sensitive to fear, and their travel behavior was affected more substantially. People preferred cars the most, followed by taxis when they do not use buses. Wen et al. (2005) analyzed the influence of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) on Chinese consumer behavior and their leisure travel. The results revealed that SARS greatly affected the daily life of people and played a role in changing tour choices and travel patterns. Women and lower education groups were affected more than other groups. Liu et al. (2011) examined the effect of SARS on air travel in U.S., China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan using the ARIMA model. Worldwide fear negatively affected air travel among those countries; however, fear of the risk was perceived differently between countries, thus reflecting different life styles. Fenichel et al. (2013) examined the hypothesis that individuals practice a voluntary action of defense when there is a risk of contagious disease. They tested the hypothesis by assessing the number of passengers who gave up air travel because of concerns of being infected by the contagious disease. The results revealed that people took self-defensive action against the contagious disease; however, this did not seem to be in accordance with risk level. Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) studied the effect of both terror and disease threats on hospitality business in Thailand. They found that seasoned travelers were less fearful of disease and terror threats in general; nevertheless, certain fatal diseases such as SARS strongly influenced the travel behavior of visitors. Keane (1998) more directly focused on fear itself when analyzing the behavior of women. The research found that women's fear of crime restricted their movement, and the number of alternative options was increased when fear was eliminated. Finally, Church et al. (2000) reported a similar finding, suggesting that the exclusion from fear is a category of social exclusion. They claimed that social characteristics, gender, and the use of public space and transportation affect the fear of public spaces.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 231, "end": 249, "text": "Choi et al.

This study aimed to initiate the discussion on why and how socioeconomic characteristics affect travel behavior differently in our daily lives. To this end, this study analyzed a large data set of transit (bus and subway) use and revealed the differences in travel behavior among different social and geographical groups.

As discussed previously, existing studies have investigated the association between socioeconomic characteristics and behavioral changes when under threats and risks. However, the suggested causal relationship typically lacks a basic explanation of why such an association has been built. We hypothesized that a conceptual device of activity-based approach is required to provide an in-depth and more transferable reasoning of the association between the two. Life fixity is the opposite of the flexibility or degree of freedom to change the details of daily life. It can be defined as the degree of difficulty to change the details of daily life. If a typical day is full of mandatory responsibilities, the person would have no other choice but to perform all activities as scheduled. Therefore, his/ her daily schedule is not sensitive to any demands for change. This reasoning is in line with the notion of time geography (Pred, 1977 (Pred, , 1981a (Pred, , 1981b , from which activity-based transportation studies were initiated (Ettema and Timmermans, 1997) . Travel is derived from activity participation; thus, any change in travel behavior would be affected by the degree of life fixity.

The recent outbreak of MERS in South Korea is a suitable case to examine the role of life fixity. The disease caused a great deal of fear rather than medical fatalities at the societal level. The actual contagious rate of MERS was proven to be much lower than that of other wellknown pandemic diseases such as SARS. Nevertheless, South Korea went into a state of panic in May and June 2015 because of fear. Public fear had a strong mental influence on everyone, forcing them to dramatically change their normal daily activities to alternatives that may be safer. Nevertheless, the degree of change was not the same between different people. People considerably altered their daily activities if they could easily make such changes. Those who were not able to make such changes easily because of the strong fixity in daily life did not alter their daily activities as much as they might have wanted.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Research Concept"}, {"text": "The study did not directly measure the life fixity of an individual; instead, average land price was used in the measurements. We hypothesized that life fixity has a high correlation with social status and income level. One of the representative indicators of the social status and income level of individuals is the land price of the area where they live. Seoul, like many other major cities in the world, has rather clear geographical divisions of neighborhoods with varying social statuses, which are frequently represented by the different average land prices of the corresponding neighborhood. The study assessed the overall change in travel behavior during the MERS outbreak and revealed the differences in behavioral change according to the land price of the neighborhood and the MERS-affected area. The resulting analysis generated statistical inferences to generalize the findings at the Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) level. The study also derived some implications from the analysis results.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Research Concept"}, {"text": "The analysis was focused on the MERS outbreak reported in South Korea on May 20, 2015, and on the fear that persisted until the end of June. The capital city of Seoul, the area of this study, is located at the center of the Korean peninsula and consists of 424 administrative units (dongs) with an area size of 605 km 2 and a population of 10 million peoplemillion. On average, a dong in Seoul has an area size of 1.42 km 2 , a population size of 23,584 inhabitants, an employment size of approximately 12,000 workers, a population density of 16,609 inhabitants per km 2 , and an employment density of 8470 workers per km 2 . The city also has a highly dense network of roads and railways. Seoul has 278 subway stations with 331.9 km of railways, which can accommodate more than 5 million passengers (including net and transfer) every day as of 2014. Seoul is one of three large local governments of the SMA, which consist of the city of Seoul, the city of Inchon, and Gyeonggi province. The transit system is closely connected with subway and bus lines within the SMA region. When transferring to another mode of transport within the SMA, passengers pay only the additional costs that are calculated by subtraction of the precedent mode fee from the subsequent mode fee. The company that operates Smart Card mainly manages the transactions in Seoul, and the company that operates EB Card mainly manages the transactions in Gyeonggi and Inchon. Although two different companies are involved, the two cards have the same function. The current study obtained transit use data of Smart Card transactions; thus, the analysis was mostly on travel in Seoul (about 90% of the data obtained). It should be noted that TAZ, the basic unit of transportation data collection and analysis, is almost the same with the administrative unit (dong) in Seoul. This is because transportation analysis should be linked to population data that are available at the dong level in Seoul. Hence, the number of TAZs of Seoul is the same as the number of dongs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data and Analysis Results"}, {"text": "The study used three kinds of data: Smart Card transaction data of individual transit use, average land values of a TAZ, and locations of potential MERS hotspots in Seoul. First, smart card data of individual transit use were collected on May 20, 2015, when people first knew about MERS, and on June 10, 2015, when public fear was at an extremely high level. The data contained a log of the trips of each individual who uses Smart Card for transit from the first \"get-on\" until the last \"get-off\" event of a particular day. The information on each trip included an encrypted personal ID (which is valid only for the day), user type (adult, children, youth, senior, disabled, and national merit), transport mode used (village bus, local bus, mainline bus, outer bus, circular bus, and subway), a flag for transfer, bus line ID, service operator ID, vehicle ID, departure time, departure bus stop or subway station ID, arrival bus stop or subway station ID, the number of accompanying passengers, get-on fare, and get-off fare.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data"}, {"text": "Second, data on land price per square meter averaged of each TAZ were obtained from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation. Land price was used as a representative indicator of the various socioeconomic statuses or income levels averaged across individuals in each TAZ. Seoul has a clear socio-spatial segregation within its territory. The old downtown and new city center have areas of very high housing values and land prices; those who are well-off live in these areas. A recent analysis of big data on the Korean national health insurance conducted by a medical expert revealed that living location determines life standard and even life expectancy (Daily Hankook, 2015) . Therefore, this study hypothesized that people living outside of these areas would have a higher level of life fixity and thus less sensitive to external demands for change in daily activities as their income is on average lower than the income of those living in those areas. Given the overall change in response to the threat of MERS, areas with high land prices would show a bigger change in travel behavior because of the low level of life fixity, whereas other areas with low land prices would show a smaller change because of the high level of life fixity. In addition to land price, the data of other characteristics were also collected at the TAZ level for statistical inference.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 671, "end": 692, "text": "(Daily Hankook, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data"}, {"text": "Finally, the study identified 31 potential MERS hotspots, which were TAZs with locations that people suspected as sites with a high risk for disease transmission. The potential hotspots included 5 big transport terminal complexes and rail stations, 3 grand stadiums, 4 big gathering places, 7 hospitals and clinics that the central government announced as the medical facilities (potentially) affected by the disease, and 12 other big general hospitals in Seoul.

Activity on May 20 was normal like any other day, whereas fear peaked on June 10 during which the number of trips was sharply decreased by 11.8%. This large reduction in public transit use in a short period of time could not be explained by any other reason except a pandemic situation. The number of people traveling was also reduced by 10.8%. The number of trips per person dropped from 2.80 to 2.77, and the number of tours was reduced from 1.95 to 1.91. Total travel cost per person was also reduced from USD 1.76 to 1.74, and total travel time was reduced from 62.63 to 60.40 min. The number of people who visited the TAZs with potential MERS hotspots was sharply decreased by 13.88%, whereas the number of people who visited the TAZs without potential MERS hotspots was decreased by only 8.80%. The situational change resulting from fear is illustrated in Table 1 . The data revealed that tourists had an extreme response to fear, and subway use was affected much more compared with buses. People may suspect subway stations to have a higher risk for disease transmission because of the higher traffic of people at these places than at bus stops. Table 2 shows the difference in travel behavior according to type of smart card user. Kids and senior users drastically reduced their use of public transport, whereas adults and youths only slightly reduced public transport use. A number of primary schools were closed for several days during the MERS outbreak because of fear of disease transmission, and parents were very much reluctant to send their children to school at this time. A large reduction in senior citizens traveling was also observed because the disease is known to be particularly deadly to them. Adults who had to work and youths who were strictly required to attend classes showed a smaller % change than others in trip frequency as they have higher life fixity. It is interesting to see that the school system is rather different between primary and secondary schools in terms of their rigidity in studying time during the MERS outbreak. Some primary school kids who normally travel by public transport were driven by their parents with private cars to schools. Nevertheless, a distinct difference still existed between the two school systems; most primary schools were closed during the pandemic period, but most secondary schools followed their usual academic calendar because of the tight schedule in studying for university entrance examinations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 934, "end": 941, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1232, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Significant Influence of Fear on Travel Behavior"}, {"text": "Another example of the role of life fixity was demonstrated during peak hours.

The concept of life fixity was not explicitly defined here; however, it would help understand the different degrees of behavioral changes in response to external influences.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The study identified several key findings. First, fear had a significant influence on travel behavior. Second, life fixity, the degree of which was represented by land prices, was relevant when determining the extent of behavioral change. Third, life fixity and potential MERS hotspots were affected in different manners. Life fixity affected the overall reduction in trip frequency and particularly transit get-on frequency. People living in neighborhoods with higher land prices were found to reduce transit use more than others do. However, the potential MERS hotspots did not have a significant influence on behavioral change during peak hours even though they had a general effect on travel frequency throughout the day. Finally, regression analysis statistically demonstrated the influence of land price, MERS hotspots, and some other geographical variables on the change in travel behavior. In addition, regression analysis identified the influential variables that caused the reduction in trip frequency during MERS outbreak, which included land price, whether the TAZ had potentially problematic hotspots, the number of businesses, the number of individuals over 65, and the number of restaurant businesses. These variables reflected either the effect of life fixity or pandemicspecific characteristics of the TAZs. Further research needs and objectives were identified. First, transit user type, transport mode, and travel time of the day should have a close relationship when explaining the changes in travel behavior during MERS outbreak. A set of cross-correlation studies and additional spatial analyses using GIS would be required. Second, a rigorous measure of life fixity needs to be developed. This concept has a strong social implication and is an interdisciplinary theme in topics of transportation science, geography, urban planning, sociology, and psychology. A defined measure would provide a better understanding of the different behavioral changes in response to external influences. Third, spatial resolution can be an issue. If any suspicious MERS hotspot is relatively small within a TAZ, the influence of MERS on trip reduction will be small, and the influence will be the other way around if the MERS hotspot is relatively large. Therefore, a buffer boundary around the MERS hotspot, instead of a TAZ boundary, should be investigated. Finally, there should be some regularity in the pattern of change in travel behavior itself. The mathematical functional relationships representing the behavioral changes over time could be formed by different socioeconomic groups and geographical areas.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [],
