In 1972, Berg combined DNA from the gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli and the Simian Virus 40 in an exogenous plasmid or vector (Jackson et al. 1972) . The following year Cohen demonstrated that DNA from the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus could be introduced and stably propagated into E. coli (Chang and Cohen 1974) .

(Bailey et al. 1990, p. 15) The following year, Bailey analysed useful molecules that could be successfully produced in microorganisms (Bailey 1991) , while others proposed that the modifications of the carbon metabolic flux should occur only at the principal node of the primary metabolic networks to overproduce desired metabolites (Stephanopoulos and Vallino 1991) . These remarkable reviews clearly identified metabolic engineering as an extension of genetic engineering, laying a foundation for the successful field that now allows the production of biofuels (Alper and Stephanopoulos 2009 ), pharmaceuticals, fineand bulk-chemicals (Keasling 2010) . Jay Keasling's most recent breakthrough has been the production of a precursor of artemisinin in engineered yeast. Artemisinin is chemically known as a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, the drug of choice to treat malaria, preferentially in combination with other derivatives. Every year, 500 million people become infected with this disease, and 1 million persons die of it in the developing world, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Every 30 s, on average, a child dies from malaria worldwide. Artemisinin is obtained from the leaves of the plant Artemisia annua, also known as sweet wormwood. Using its leaves, a simple tea used to be prepared to treat fever, including malaria, in the traditional Chinese medicine but it was not until the 1970s that it was rediscovered for modern medical science. Chinese scientists extracted the active compound artemisinin (known as arteannuin in the past or qinghaosu in Chinese). However, this drug remained largely unknown to the Western scientific community until 1979 when a review of its application was published in English language (Group 1979) . In fact, it took a while for the rest of the world-and especially the World Health Organization (WHO)-to discover the potential of the antimalarial drug (Tu 2011) . Unfortunately, it has been argued that there is a global supply shortage of artemisinin owing to an increasing demand and to the environmental factors affecting the harvest of the 14-week-growing-plant, primarily in Chinese and Vietnamese but more recently in Indian and East African farms (Enserink 2005 ), yet this is a matter of controversy. 8 Artemisinin can also be chemically synthesized, but it is very expensive and non-affordable to most of the patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 418, "end": 439, "text": "(Goeddel et al. 1979b", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 461, "end": 482, "text": "(Goeddel et al. 1979a", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 598, "end": 614, "text": "(Rasmussen 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1115, "text": "\". 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1564, "text": "(Morange 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1898, "text": "[\u2026]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2038, "end": 2065, "text": "(Bailey et al. 1990, p. 15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2186, "text": "(Bailey 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2372, "end": 2405, "text": "(Stephanopoulos and Vallino 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2632, "text": "(Alper and Stephanopoulos 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2676, "end": 2691, "text": "(Keasling 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 3805, "end": 3817, "text": "(Group 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3973, "end": 3982, "text": "(Tu 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 4275, "end": 4289, "text": "(Enserink 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetically Modified Organisms"}, {"text": "To come up with another source of artemisinin, Keasling and colleagues ingeniously inserted several genes from different species into the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which, fed solely by sugar and basic nutrients, is pushed to start a 3-day-culture production of artemisic acid, a precursor that can be chemically oxidized by standard procedures to artemisinin (Ro et al. 2006 ). The process of producing artemisinin has been shortened to only 14 days, but this took Keasling and colleagues many years of research with both successes and failures (Keasling 2008) . For example, suboptimal expression of exogenous genes (having different genetic code usage) or volatility of molecules were encountered, but these problems were solved by optimizing synthetic genes (Martin et al. 2003 ) and reaction conditions (Newman et al. 2006 ). In the end, Keasling's group was able to produce significant levels (>100 mg/L) of artemisic acid by engineering the mevalonate metabolic pathway with a total of 11 enzymes from E. coli, the yeast S. cerevisiae and the plant A. annua in E. coli (Fig. 4) (Chang et al. 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 373, "end": 388, "text": "(Ro et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 559, "end": 574, "text": "(Keasling 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 775, "end": 794, "text": "(Martin et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 821, "end": 840, "text": "(Newman et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1117, "text": "(Chang et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1089, "end": 1097, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Genetically Modified Organisms"}, {"text": "The metabolic pathway engineered in E. coli was later transferred to a genetically stable yeast strain that can efficiently transport out of the cells up to 115 mg of artemisic acid per litre of culture, allowing therefore a simple and inexpensive purification process (Ro et al. 2006) .

Upon glucose take-up, E. coli transforms it into acetyl-CoA via the glycolysis pathway. The introduction of 11 enzymes from E. coli (brown; 1, 7, 8), S. cerevisiae (orange; 2-6) and A. annua (green; 9-11) allows the conversion of acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate pathway into artemisic acid, which can be thereafter chemically converted to artemisinin.

They lack a cell wall but the reason why these bacteria were chosen as model organisms is because they bear the smallest genomes among all bacteria that can support cellular growth in the laboratory.

Second, after overcoming the technical difficulties, they were able to recombine all strains and delete completely the 321 UAG codons as well as the protein that terminates protein synthesis at this signal for yielding the first GRO: E. coli C321.\u0394A. This bacterium exhibited improved efficiencies for incorporating XAAs into various proteins and increased resistant against infection by the bacteriophage T7 compared to the parental E. coli strain MG1655 (Lajoie et al. 2013b ).

Given that synthetic biology is increasingly targeting these multicellular organisms for genomic modifications, its acceptance by the public could be more difficult to gain.

In reality, scientists invent or design something that has not existed before by using something that already existed; they are closer to \"manipulatio\" (manipulating) and \"creatio ex existendo\" (creating something out of existent parts) than to \"creation ex nihilo\" (Boldt and Muller 2008) . This is a subtle, yet important difference: Scientists claiming the creation of synthetic life have been accused of \"Playing God in Frankenstein's Footsteps\" (van den Belt 2009), with unfortunate consequences for the reputation of the field and its social acceptance (Schummer 2011) . Perhaps the natural scientists do this on purpose to challenge the ethical (Link 2012) and religious (Dabrock 2009 ) views of other scholars working on synthetic biology. On the other hand, overstating that GMOs, GEMs, GEOs, GDOs, GROs and CMOs will solve all human problems is not beneficial because exaggerating exactly into this direction generates mistrust in the public, as many emergent technologies have done in history (Torgersen 2009 ).

Synthesis means to put together two parts to form a new one. This definition suggests that any minor modification of an extant organism would render it 'synthetic', which would be the case for all GMOs, CMEs, GEOs, GDOs, GROs and possibly CMOs. However, a bacterium with a synthetic plasmid is not the same as a bacterium with a synthetic genome, so we should make a distinction. For example, the synthetic genome of GDO M. mycoides jcvi-syn1.0 represents about 1 % of the whole dry cell mass. The cell reprogramming was performed using a genome borrowed from a related species, in which about 0.1 % genetic changes (watermarks) were done. So, why should this bacterium be called synthetic when the other 98.9 % components are natural? In reality, this bacterium is more natural than synthetic: Although genomes control gene expression, the truth is that genomes can only be useful if there are proteins that can process their information, as it was the case for M. mycoides jcvi-syn1.0. In a contrasting example, when the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis was cloned into the bacterium B. subtilis, genes from the former could not be expressed in the latter organism because of \"incompatibility\" or context-dependency issues (Itaya et al. 2005) .

However, the introduction of revived species could pose disease threats to native species, in a manner reminiscent to the introduction of invasive species into new environments. 28 In addition, some conservationists also worry that \"de-extinguished\" species would have a limited genetic diversity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 360, "text": "(Minteer 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 522, "end": 536, "text": "(Minteer 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Resurrecting Life"}, {"text": "In summary, one should ponder whether it is worthwhile investing huge amounts of human and financial resources in ambitious projects for resurrecting life given not only the technical and nontechnical difficulties, but also the paradoxes of our world: Devastating epidemics, hunting, habitat loss and degradation caused by both human industrial activities and climate change are triggering an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, with estimates of 500 up to 36,000 species of amphibians, birds and mammals disappearing every year (Monastersky 2014 resurrecting life, synthetic biologists should help conservation biologists to develop innovative ideas for protecting the already thousands of endangered species: \"Attempting to revive lost species is in many ways a refusal to accept our moral and technological limits in nature.\" (Minteer 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 529, "end": 546, "text": "(Monastersky 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 829, "end": 843, "text": "(Minteer 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Resurrecting Life"}, {"text": "I have attempted to outline the most important areas of current research in synthetic biology in a general inclusive framework according to different engineering approaches. Almost all engineering efforts produce protocells, CMOs and GMOs, some of which are developed by well-known genetic engineering methods, and others by using more sophisticated tools. For example, the production of Genetically Engineered Machines (GEMs) is outsourced to undergraduate students Fig. 10 Life prerequisites. Living systems as we know them have a genetic program (DNA), a metabolism fuelled by enzymatic reactions and proteins that execute this program using RNA as intermediate in protein translation (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA), and a container or membrane formed of lipids. Viruses are proteins (sometimes with lipids) encoding DNA or RNA, but since they have no metabolism, they are not alive, a fact that has puzzled scientists over decades (Villarreal 2004 ). Organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts contain metabolites and usually a minimal genetic program, but they are contained within a larger organism so these alone cannot be alive. Finally, the cytoplasm containing proteins, metabolites and lipids would not be alive without genetic material every year across the world with the advantage of developing creativity and innovation in younger generations for solving complex problems. Similarly, researchers working in synthetic genomics have produced genomically designed organisms (GDOs) as a result of basic research, spinning-off revolutionary applications for the rapid assembly of synthetic DNA. More recently, the ground-breaking CRISPR-Cas9 tool, product of basic research, has allowed for the emergence of an impressive number of genomically edited organisms (GEOs), and in less than two years to better understand disease models and cellular biology as well as engineering multiple traits in microorganism for the optimal production of drugs, biofuels, and chemicals. However, the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system should be cautious especially when engineering human embryonic stem cells as well as wild populations of organisms in the open environment (Ledford 2015) . Finally, evolutionary approaches have accelerated the construction of microbial GROs and CMOs that promise to shed light on the meaning and evolution of life by endowing living systems with unnatural building blocks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 923, "end": 939, "text": "(Villarreal 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2171, "text": "(Ledford 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 467, "end": 474, "text": "Fig. 10", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Importantly, any sort of genetic modification such as a single DNA base mutation, metabolic pathway optimization or whole genome recoding in any of these synthetic life forms will create a novel combination of genes and their products at the level of (pre-and post)-transcription (RNA) and -translation (protein), thus triggering a new network of gene interactions (at the transcriptome and proteome level) in the host organism and across organisms, which are difficult to understand and predict even using the most advanced mathematical algorithms and technological tools. These phenomena, which fall under the scope of epistasis (Phillips 2008) , emphasise the evolutionary complexity of gene interactions inherent to biology. For this reason, synthetic biologists should be aware of the limitations that must be overcome to predict the behaviour of living systems. The purpose of illustrating the benefits, but also potential risks of these emergent life forms is to provide scholars from the social sciences and humanities as well as non-scientists with a glimpse of what synthetic biologists are actually doing. The challenges, dilemmas and paradoxes surrounding the field also show that there are already big challenges in a globalized world that cannot be solved exclusively by technological means.
