IH clinical presentation is nonspecific and commonly associates intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms usually worsened by food intake, subsequently leading to anorexia [2] . Noteworthy, COVID-19 infection can also be diagnosed upon various nonspecific digestive symptoms in 3 to 79% of cases according to the published series. These symptoms include anorexia (39.9-50.2%), vomiting (3.6-66.7%), diarrhea (2-49.5%), and/or abdominal pain (2.2-6%) [3] . However, little is currently known on these gastrointestinal symptoms in the context of patients previously operated from bariatric surgery and especially after procedures that modify the gastrointestinal tract anatomy (i.e., RYGB).",

Based on the patient charts, mesenteric defects were left open during the procedure. The initial postoperative course and the follow-up were uneventful. At her planned 5year postoperative follow-up appointment (February 2020), she weighed 85 kg (BMI: 31.8 kg/m 2 ) and had a normal physical examination. Two months later (April 2020), she presented with transient and unspecific episodes of acute abdominal pain aggravated by food intake followed by anorexia and absence of flatus. She displayed neither signs of pulmonary infection nor general signs of severity or fever. On laboratory tests, white blood cell count and PCT were within normal ranges, and CRP was slightly increased (13.7 mg/L N < 5 mg/l). Since the clinical history was highly suggestive of an IH, we performed an emergent abdominal CT scan. While abdomen imaging was normal, we incidentally found, on chest CT images, signs typically suggestive of COVID-19 infection (Fig. 1) [4] . The nasopharyngeal swab, analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, proved positive for severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; i.e., COVID 19). The patient was hospitalized and benefitted from COVID-19 symptomatic treatment and further discharged after 2 days of observation with favorable clinical evolution. Two weeks later, she no longer complained from any digestive symptom and was recovering in spite of persisting asthenia.",
