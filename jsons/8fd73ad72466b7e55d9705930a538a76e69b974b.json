They can be found in wheat, corn, tomatoes, peanuts, kidney beans, bananas, peas, lentils, soybeans, mushrooms, tubers, seeds, mistletoe and potatoes among many others. Due to their ability to bind reversibly with specific carbohydrate structures and their abundant availability, plant lectins have commonly been used as a molecular tool in various disciplines of biology and medicine. Whilst once thought of being a dietary toxin, the focus on plant lectins has since shifted to understanding the useful properties of these lectins and utilizing them in medicinal applications to advance human health.

Following the discovery of Stillmark, a number of other plant seed extracts demonstrated the same ability to agglutinate red blood cells, but escalating interest in lectins was sparked during the Second World War as a result of the awareness of using lectins for blood typing. Because some lectins were found to be specific for various blood types (A, B or O), and others were found to have specificities for different glycans, lectins were used for blood typing before blood transfusions were performed [5, 6] . Lectins have since been found in almost every plant species studied and are particularly abundant in the seeds of leguminous plants. They have also been found in various tissues and organs of many vertebrates and invertebrates [7] . Due to their biochemical properties, lectins have become a beneficial tool in several fields of biological research including immunology [8] , study of membrane structure, cell recognition [9] , cancer research [10] , and clinical microbiology [11] .

Firstly, merolectins are small monomeric lectins consisting exclusively of a single carbohydratebinding domain. Due to their monovalent nature, they do not possess agglutinating activity, such as hevein isolated from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis [13] . Figure 5 .1b shows the crystal structure of hevein with (4s)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Next are hololectins, also exclusively built up of carbohydrate-binding domains but containing at least two such domains that are either identical or very homologous and bind either the same or structurally similar sugar(s), and most plant lectins are included in this subgroup. One example is Concanavalin A which is a tetrameric protein and binds specifically \u03b1-d-mannosyl and \u03b1-d-glucosyl residues (two hexoses differing only by the alcohol on carbon 2). A refined structure of Concanavalin A with mannose at 2.0 angstroms resolution is shown in Fig. 5 .1b [14] . Another example is peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin [15] . It is a 110-kDa, homotetrameric non-glycosylated protein (without RIP activity) and shows a specificity for the tumor-associated T-antigenic disaccharide Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc. The third Crystal data were from RCSB protein data bank and visualized by the UCSF chimera software as used previously [23] . Protein crystal structures were from PROTEIN DATA BANK: Hevein (PDB ID: 1Q9B); Concanavalin A (PDB ID: 5CNA) [14] ; Ricin (PDB ID: 2AAI) [16] ; Peanut agglutinin (PDB ID: 1CR7); BC2L-C (N-terminal domain: 2WQ4; C-terminal domain: 2XR4) [18] . Please note that BC2L-C is a bacterial lectin since currently no crystal structure of plant superlectin has been released. The coil, helix and strand are shown in dark grey, red and green, respectively group is chimerolectins, which are fusion proteins consisting of one or more carbohydrate-binding domain(s) tandemly arrayed to an unrelated domain. An example of this is ricin, which can be classified as both lectin and type II ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) [16] . As shown in Fig. 5 .1b, ricin consists of two parts; an A chain (with N-glycosidase activity/RIP activity) and a B chain (hemagglutinating/lectin activity) with the B chain capable of binding different carbohydrates, such as \u03b2-d-glucose and \u03b2-d-galactose as shown in the figure. Lastly, superlectins are a type of chimerolectins which consist of at least two structurally different domains which recognize structurally unrelated carbohydrates [17] . For instance, TxLC-I is a superlectin isolated from tulip bulbs, and it consists of a mannose-binding domain and an unrelated GalNAcbinding domain. Since there is no crystal data on plant superlectin, the crystal structure of a superlectin purified from Burkholderia cepacia (a Gram-negative bacterium), named BC2L-A, is used for demonstration ( Fig. 5.1b) [18] . The N-terminal domain of BC2L-A is a novel TNF-\u03b1-like fucose-binding lectin while the C-terminal is a calciumdependent bacterial lectin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 400, "end": 404, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1121, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1416, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1532, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1560, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1659, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2133, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2579, "end": 2583, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2947, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 148, "text": "Fig. 5.1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 407, "end": 415, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1049, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2148, "end": 2154, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2942, "text": "Fig. 5.1b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Types of Plant Lectins"}, {"text": "Plant lectins can also be grouped into different families according to some common features (legume lectins, type II ribosome-inactivating proteins, monocot mannose-binding lectins, and other lectins) [19] .

This specificity is usually determined by comparing sugars on the basis of the minimum concentration needed to inhibit hemagglutination.

Serology was the first discipline of medicine that relies on the specific biological activity of lectins [24] . Lectins agglutinate erythrocytes by binding to a carbohydrate-containing moiety on the surface of the cells and forming cross-bridges between them [4] . This useful property of lectins endows them the ability to discriminate between red blood cells that have different terminal, non-reducing sugars in the major glycoprotein that carries the blood group antigens [25] . For example, blood group A is determined by the presence of N-acetyl-galactosamine in the terminal, non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide portion of the receptor protein while group B is determined by galactose in this position. If both of these sugars are lacking, fucose is the terminal sugar and this determines blood group O.

Because of their ability to stimulate multiple lymphocyte clones, lectins are classified as polyclonal mitogens.
