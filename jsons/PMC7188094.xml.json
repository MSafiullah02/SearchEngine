By 11th Mar 2020 the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic with 118,00 cases in 114 countries and 4291 deaths3. COVID-19 is currently understood as a droplet spread illness with a reproduction number of approximately 2.24, transmitted via respiratory droplets, contact, fomites and fecal-oral routes5,6 and with high lethality (3.4%)7. Many more patients with COVID-19 than SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)8 have mild symptoms that contribute to spread as these patients are not picked up by current screening mechanisms9. The current outbreak is expected to last at least till the end of 202010 with the possibility of a second deadlier wave several months after the current outbreak like the 1918 Spanish Flu11. There is no known specific treatment or vaccine.",

ECT is an essential psychiatric service that provides lifesaving treatment for severe mental illnesses like depression and catatonia if given in a timely fashion12,13 and for which there is no viable alternative. However, ECT service is often not prioritized in hospitals14 and may be stopped if anaesthesia resources are limited. This occurred at the beginning of the COVID-19 situation in a general hospital in Singapore, resulting in an acute ECT course stopping halfway for a patient with recurrent depression previously responsive to ECT. The team adjusted pharmacotherapy for the next two weeks before referring her to our ECT service. Unfortunately, the patient completed suicide 2 days before her scheduled ECT in our service. This tragic vignette underscores the importance of not just having an ECT service but having one that can respond in a timely fashion to patient needs. While 5 of the 7 ECT services15 in Singapore were still operational at the time of this writing, the other 2 have shut down due to lack of anaesthesia manpower while others now require case by case approval for ECT by the operating theatres.",

            "text": "There are other inherent challenges of an ECT service in a COVID-19 environment. ECT requires general anaesthesia which involves close contact with patient oral and airway secretions and actively encouraging the patient to cough in the recovery room after ECT. Each patient contact with the team can last for several hours in a small, confined environment with recirculated air and repeated 10 to 20 times over a period of weeks to months. Patients from a wide geographical region16 and are often kept in close contact in small rooms for several hours before and after ECT. Patients receiving ECT tend to be older14 and have a high chance of having comorbid medical conditions like hypertension or diabetes17 all of which increases their mortality if infected with COVID-197. Further, patients receiving ECT often have poorer hygiene18, live in crowded wards or housing19 and are hence less able to observe the recommendations of good personal hygiene and social distancing to prevent COVID-19 infection. This was sadly demonstrated in Korea by a COVID-19 super spreader infecting an entire psychiatric ward with COVID-1920. Other challenges facing ECT services include the common practice of a high rotation of ECT practitioners and anaesthetists within a single service which increases the risk of both ECT staff being infected by a large pool of high risk patients and infected ECT staff infecting other units when they rotate out of their ECT duties.",

The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 27 directs all patients in Singapore requiring involuntary psychiatric admission to a single site, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). Patients who are involuntarily admitted or assessed to lack capacity (as defined in the Mental Capacity Act 28 as the ability of the patient to understand the information, weigh up the information, remember the information, or communicate the decision) can be prescribed ECT by their treating psychiatrist. Singapore adopted a Whole-of-Government (WOG) approach with a multi-ministry task force coordinating all COVID-19 related activity. Specific measures that related to healthcare included travel restrictions placed on healthcare staff travelling to high risk areas, home quarantine for staff returning from high risk areas and restriction of practice locations to a single or limited number of sites for all healthcare personnel to reduce risk of cross-institutional transmission of COVID-1929. All healthcare staff were to take and document their temperature twice a day to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and mask fitting exercises (for N95 masks) for all clinical staff were completed in Jan 2020. All leave for healthcare staff was cancelled to facilitate business continuity plans (BCP) of having backup teams so that if a team member was infected with COVID-19, the alternative team would come to replace them while the exposed team would be put on quarantine30. Staff who could not get refunds for travel cancellations were reimbursed by IMH.",

The COVID-19 situation necessitated more cleaning and disinfection services. We arranged with our estates management team to have a cleaner on site during ECT operational hours to respond expeditiously to ECT room decontamination between batches of patients and ECT staff helped with cleaning their own area of work with 70% ethanol. We switched to single use Mapleson C circuits for anaesthesia for each batch of patients with disposable bite blocks, oral airways and HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters for each patient.",

A decision was made to restrict the pool of staff down to just 2 ECT practitioners, 2 anaesthetists and 11 nursing staff and reduce the number of staff required at any time to 11 (down from 12). We were able to reduce the number of staff required by enlisting the ward and outpatient staff to assist with ECT patient transportation. One of the ECT nursing staff would have a new role of receiving ECT patients and conducting COVID-19 risk screening and temperature taking before letting the patient into the ECT room. This nursing staff also ensured that a maximum of 1 visitor equipped with a face mask could accompany the patient. This was on top of IMH measures of restricting all access to a single entrance operated 24/7 by a dedicated screening team using the current suspect COVID-19 case definition and temperature screening. These changes required a concerted effort from nursing and human resources to adjust contracts and staff allocation. We were also fortunate to have recently trained an advance practice nurse (APN) to be an ECT practitioner37 which allowed for a backup ECT practitioner as 8 of the original 10 ECT practitioners were requisitioned for other roles in IMH during DORSCON Orange. The alternate ECT practitioner and anaesthetist did not meet their counterparts to prevent cross team infection and 2 reserve nurses were similarly deployed outside the ECT room as alternative nursing staff. The alternative team allowed the primary team to take short local leave of up to 3 days at a stretch for staff rest and recuperation.",

There was an initial thought of having 1 patient in the ECT room at any one time and decontaminating the entire room between patients. While this would minimize cross infection risk, it would have reduced capacity by about 70-80% as each patient required at least 30 minutes of post-ECT continuous monitoring, rendering this option unfeasible. Consistent with the principle of a calibrated approach to COVID-19 infection control measures38 and low rates of COVID-19 community spread, we decided on a balanced approach of batching patients by physical location (inpatients by ward, outpatients separately from inpatients) to minimize the chance of infection while only losing 30-40% capacity. This required a full review of all locations patients came from and calculating the load from each location to optimize scheduling. The intent was to minimize mixing of patients from different locations and decrease the chance of infection. With the new strategy of listing patients by location, a new operations board was set up as a visual management aid for staff. It gave staff a comprehensive view of patients\u2019 locations and let us realize that some wards had as few as 1 patient receiving ECT and others as many as 10. (See Image 1 below)",

We started communicating with referring psychiatrists about the decreased ECT treatment capacity which would necessitate a decrease of ECT frequency from thrice a week to twice a week for most cases and had individual case discussions with clinicians about decreasing the frequency of outpatient maintenance ECT.

After a review and audit of our infection control procedures and assessing the need for ECT for the 10 patients on the ward, the collective decision was that our current infection control protocols was enough to allow for continued ECT for other patients in the ward. This was in large part due to the full PPE for staff, physical separation of patients by ward location and decontamination of the ECT room between different batches of patients from separate wards.
