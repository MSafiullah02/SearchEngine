            "text": "Since the discovery of type I interferons (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) in 1957, they have widely been used as clinical drugs [1], [2]. For example, IFN\u03b1 has been used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses and of several cancers, such as leukemia, and IFN\u03b2 is effective for treating multiple sclerosis. Type I IFNs exert their effects through the activation of Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway [3]. Upon binding of the IFNs to their cell surface receptors (IFNAR), the receptor-associated kinases JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) become activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor subunit, IFNAR1. The phosphorylated subunit provides specific docking sites for the activation of STATs by JAK1/TYK2-mediated phosphorylation [4], [5]. Activated STATs dissociate from the receptor and translocate into the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors that bind to the promoter regions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [6]. STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers associate with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9) to form the transcription complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which binds to IFN stimulatory response elements (ISREs) within the promoters of ISGs [7]. On the other hand, homodimers and heterodimers of STAT1 and STAT3 bind to gamma-activated sequence (GAS) response elements [8]. The ISG proteins generated by these pathways play key roles in the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses [9], [10].",

Moreover, deregulation of the modification systems gives rise to numerous human diseases, such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and immune diseases. Conjugation of ubiquitin and Ubls to target proteins involves three-step cascade enzymes: ubiquitin- and Ubl-activating E1 enzymes, ubiquitin- and Ubl-conjugating E2 enzymes, and ubiquitin- and Ubl E3 ligases. Protein modifications by ubiquitin and Ubls are reversible processes that are catalyzed by isopeptidases, called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and Ubl-specific proteases (ULPs), respectively.",

On the other hand, UBP43 (also called USP18) acts as a major ISG15-specific deconjugating enzyme.

A number of proteins that are involved in antiviral signaling pathways, including RIG-I, MDA-5, Mx1, PKR, STAT1, and JAK1, have been identified as target proteins for ISGylation. Moreover, recent studies have explored the biological functions of ISG15 and its conjugation to target proteins. ISG15 and its conjugation impair viral replication in vivo [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Conversely, certain viruses induce viral specific proteins that can deconjugate ISG15 from its target proteins or prevent the generation of ISGylated proteins, thus abrogating the antiviral response [18], [27], [28]. However, functional consequences of reversible ISG15 modification of most target proteins, which are induced by viral infection, are still largely unknown.",

Type I IFNs suppress cell proliferation and promote apoptosis and, therefore, have been used in the treatment of several cancers, such as leukemia [31]. Notably, ISG15 appears to function as an oncogenic protein as well as a tumor suppressor protein [32]. The findings that cancer chemotherapeutics cause an increase in the level of ISG15 conjugates suggest the role of ISG15 as a tumor suppressor [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Conversely, the observations that deregulated overexpression of ISG15 and enhanced ISGylation are positively correlated with carcinogenesis implicate the oncogenic potential of ISG15 protein [38], [39], [40]. However, since IFNs are induced on the development of many cancers and ISG15 is an interferon-inducible protein, the enhanced expression of ISG15 and its conjugation could be a side product of IFN response to cancer and may not play a general role in carcinogenesis. Thus, further studies are required for clarification of the functional relationship between ISG15 and carcinogenesis.",

Because some antibodies directed against ubiquitin also react with ISG15, it was initially named as an ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP) [17]. This cross-reactivity is explained by the fact that the 15-kDa ISG15 protein consists of two domains, each of which bears high sequence homology to ubiquitin. The primary sequences of the two ubiquitin-like domains that correspond to the N- and C-terminal regions of ISG15 share 29% and 31% identities with ubiquitin, respectively (Fig. 2\n). Furthermore, both the N- and C-terminal domains of ISG15 show a striking similarity in their tertiary structures to ubiquitin (Fig. 3\n) [41]. Like ISG15, FAT10, which is also a member of the Ubl family, comprises two ubiquitin-like domains [42]. FAT10 is conjugated to a limited number of cellular proteins [43], [44].",

While ISG15 molecules in human, mouse, and rat are translated as precursors containing the extensions of5\u20138 amino acids in their C-termini, ISG15 proteins in most other species, including fish and bovine, are synthesized as matured forms [46]. The C-terminal LRLRGG sequence of ISG15, as that of ubiquitin, is essential not only for its conjugation to substrates but also for its recognition by the relevant processing proteases. However, this hexapeptide sequence is absent in the analogous position of the N-terminal domain. Instead, a Pro residue is present at the position 81 of ISG15, thus preventing the incorrect processing that might generate the two cleaved ubiquitin-like domains of the 15-kDa polypeptide [47].",

Infection of mice with bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) markedly induces ISG15 in macrophages. Moreover, this bacterial infection leads to ISGylation of serpin2a (serine protease inhibitor 2a), which was the first identified target protein, although its biological significance remains unknown. ISGylation of serpin2a may protect macrophages from lysosomal enzymes because a variety of lysosomal proteases are upregulated by IFN\u03b3 for the destruction of ingested bacteria and other pathogens. In addition, it has been shown that Trif/IRF-3 signaling pathway is responsible for LPS-mediated induction of ISG15 and its conjugation to target proteins [60].",

Since cycloheximide treatment does not influence the increase in the level of ISG15 mRNA, ISG15 induction appears to be a primary response to p53. While type I IFNs induce the accumulation of ISG15 mRNA in both wild-type or p53-deficient cells, dsRNA induces it only in wild-type cells, indicating that p53 is required for ISG15 induction by dsRNA but not for that by type I IFNs. In addition, sequence analysis of the human ISG15 gene has led to the identification of a putative p53-responsive element that is located adjacent to the ISG15-specific ISRE [50]. Thus, in virus-infected cells, p53 seems to exert its antiviral function by the induction of ISG15 in addition to the induction of apoptotic signaling [67].",

Interestingly, IFNs and JAK/STAT are dispensable for camptothecin-mediated induction of ISG15. ISG15 conjugates generated by camptothecin are distinct from those produced by type I IFNs, suggesting that different protein substrates are targeted for ISGylation.

Significantly, UBE1L is not detectable in all tested human lung cancer cell lines [73], [77], implicating a tumor-suppressive role of UBE1L. This repressed expression in lung cancer cell lines is intriguing because a region of chromosome 3q, in which the UBE1L gene resides, is often deregulated in preneoplastic or neoplastic epithelial tissues [78].

Indeed, the UbcH8-interacting protein EFP (estrogen-responsive finger protein) that has a RING finger domain serves as an ISG15 E3 ligase [92]. In the absence of ISG15, UbcH8 and EFP may function as E2 and E3 enzymes for ubiquitination, respectively. Upon ISG15 induction, however, ISG15 may compete with ubiquitin for binding to UbcH8, allowing UbcH8 and EFP to serve as the enzymes for ISGylation of 14-3-3\u03c3. Replacement of the active site Cys residue in the RING domain disrupts EFP-mediated ISGylation of 14-3-3\u03c3. Like UbcH8, EFP is a type I IFN-inducible protein [93]. Interestingly, EFP can ISGylate itself on the Lys117 residue and this auto-ISGylation negatively regulates the ISG15 E3 ligase activity of EFP toward 14-3-3\u03c3, suggesting that a feedback loop is operating for the control of the protein ISGylation [94], [95]. An additional RING-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, called HHARI (human homolog of Drosophila ariadne), also serves as an ISG15 E3 ligase for 4EHP [96].",

Knockdown of HERC5 by using siRNA prevents IFN-mediated increase in the total level of ISGylated cellular proteins, unlike that of EFP, which blocks the ISGylation of 14-3-3\u03c3 with little or no effect on the total level of ISGylated proteins.

UBP43 can also cleave the peptide bonds immediately after the LRLRGG sequence in ISG15 fusions [100]. Thus, UBP43 appears to also function in the processing of ISG15 precursors to generate matured ISG15 molecules. However, apart from UBP43, additional ISG15-specific proteases must exist because ISG15 precursor is processed to its matured form in UBP43-deficient mice [101]. The overlapping function of some E2 and E3 enzymes in the conjugation of both ISG15 and ubiquitin also implies the existence of promiscuous DUBs that can serve as ISG15-specific proteases. Indeed, several DUBs, including USP2, USP5, USP13, and USP14, have been identified as the candidates that can function as ISG15-processing and/or deconjugating enzymes [102]. In addition, it has been reported that recombinant ISG15 precursors can be properly processed by a 100-kDa enzyme in the extracts of human lung fibroblasts cell line A549, whose activity is unaffected by type I IFN stimulation [103]. This 100-kDa enzyme is a cysteine protease and shows a partial similarity in its amino acid sequence with that of the human ortholog of yeast Ubp1 or Ubp1-related protein. However, deletion of the UBP43 gene in mouse leads to a massive increase of ISG15 conjugates in tissues without affecting the level of ubiquitin conjugates, indicating that UBP43 is the major ISG15-specific protease that deconjugates ISG15 from its target proteins. Thus, it appears likely that the above-mentioned DUBs as well as the 100-kDa cysteine protease function primarily in the processing of ISG15 precursors to generate matured ISG15 molecules.",

However, UBP43, independently of its catalytic activity, also functions as a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling [112]. This UBP43 action is achieved through a direct interaction between UBP43 and IFNAR2, a subunit of type I IFN receptor. Binding of IFNAR2 to UBP43 interferes with the interaction between JAK and the receptor, leading to the inhibition of downstream phosphorylation cascade and other signaling events. In addition, complementation of UBP43\n\u2212\n/\n\u2212 cells with a catalytically inactive mutant of UBP43 leads to the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation to a level seen by that with wild-type UBP43.

UBP43\n\u2212\n/\n\u2212 cells show an increased induction of ISGs in response to type I IFNs, indicating that the lack of UBP43 results in a strengthened immune response. Consistently, the steady-state level of HBV DNA is substantially reduced in UBP43\n\u2212\n/\n\u2212 mice in comparison with that in UBP43\n+/+ mice. Thus, approaches that modulate UBP43 level could be used as therapeutic potentials in treating viral infection, especially for viruses sensitive to type I IFN signaling. In addition to the protection against HBV, UBP43 deficiency increases the resistance to oncogenic transformation by BCR\u2013ABL (breakpoint cluster region Abelson leukemia protein), a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal portion of BCR joined to most of the ABL tyrosine kinase [114]. This resistance to leukemia development is heavily dependent on the activation of type I IFN signaling pathway. Loss of type I IFN signaling through the loss of IFNAR results in a reversal of the original resistance to the leukemia development observed in mice that received a transplant of BCR\u2013ABL-expressing UBP43-deficient donor cells. Thus, it appears that inhibition of the negative effect of UBP43 on type I IFN signaling could enhance innate immune response against cancer development.",

Treatment with human ISG15, but not its precursor form, leads to an increase in DNA synthesis in cultured primary blood lymphocytes in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that ISG15 can act as a mitogen and that the processing of ISG15 precursor is required for the generation of biologically active ISG15 [120]. Furthermore, ISG15 has been identified as a member of the cytokine cascades. Upon viral infection, type I IFNs produced in infected cells induce the synthesis of ISG15. These ISG15 molecules can be secreted or released by lysis of the infected cells. They may then induce the production of IFN\u03b3 from T cells, augment NK cell proliferation, activate non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytolytic lymphocytes, and activate monocytes and macrophages via the induced IFN\u03b3.",

These filamin isoforms are large cytoplasmic proteins that play important parts in cross-linking cortical actin filaments into a dynamic three-dimensional structure. Recently, it has been shown that filamin B functions as a scaffold that links between activated Rac1 and a JNK cascade module for mediating type I IFN signaling [123], [124]. Filamin B interacts with Rac1, MEKK1, MKK4, and JNK and enhances their sequential activation in response to type I IFNs, thereby promoting JNK activation and apoptosis. This acceleration of JNK-mediated apoptosis provides a biological basis for antitumor and antiviral functions of type I IFNs. Furthermore, it has been revealed that type I IFNs induce ISGylation of filamin B, which leads to dissociation of Rac1, MEKK1, and MKK4 from the scaffold protein and thus to the prevention of prolonged activation of type I-induced JNK signaling pathway [124], [125]. In contrast, blockade of filamin B ISGylation by substitution of the ISG15 acceptor site Lys2467 with Arg or by siRNA-mediated knockdown of UBEL1 prevents the release of the signaling molecules from filamin B, resulting in persistent promotion of JNK activation and JNK-mediated apoptosis. These findings indicate that ISGylation of filamin B serves as a negative feedback regulatory gate for desensitization of type I IFN-induced JNK signaling, thus providing an important mechanism for the survival of uninfected bystander cells.",

PP2C\u03b2 is a target for ISGylation, and this modification blocks the suppressive function of the protein phosphatase against TAK1/TAB1-mediated NF-\u03baB activation [130]. This conclusion is based on the observation that overexpression of UBE1L, UbcH8, and ISG15 blocks the suppressive effect of PP2C\u03b2 on NF-\u03baB activation, but not that of its mutant, in which the ISG15 acceptor sites Lys12 and Lys142 are replaced by arginine.

ISG15 is conjugated to Lys92 of Ubc13, which is very closely located to its active site, thus preventing the formation of a thioester bond with ubiquitin. Since Mms2, which forms a heteromeric complex with Ubc13, interacts with both unmodified and ISGylated Ubc13, the inhibitory effect of Ubc13 ISGylation on the thioesterification of ubiquitin seems to be achieved by the inability of ISGylated Ubc13 to accept ubiquitin to its active site or by blocking the recognition of ubiquitin E1 enzyme and subsequent transfer of ubiquitin from the E1 enzyme to Ubc13. Ubc13 is known to mediate the generation of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains that are conjugated to a variety of signaling molecules [133], [134]. Thus, it is possible that ISGylation of Ubc13 may play an important role in the control of signal transduction pathways, such as NF-\u03baB pathway, which are associated with Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination [132]. UbcH8 and UbcH6 also are targets for ISGylation [83]. ISGylation of UbcH6 occurs in response to type I IFNs and blocks the thioesterification of ubiquitin, like that of Ubc13, suggesting that ISGylation of UbcH6 may also lead to the suppression of its ubiquitin-conjugating activity.",

Furthermore, overexpression of ISG15 mimics the IFN effect and inhibits the release of HIV-1 virions without having any effect on the synthesis of the viral proteins in infected cells [24]. In cells infected with HIV-1 provirus, overexpression of ISG15 and UBE1L causes a complete inhibition of HIV-1 replication. On the other hand, coexpression of UBP43 can partially rescue the release of HIV-1 in ISG15-expressing cells. Intriguingly, ISG15 expression specifically inhibits the ubiquitination of Gag and Tsg101 and disrupts their interaction, thereby preventing assembly and release of virions from infected cells. Expression of ISG15 alone (i.e., without UBE1L) does not block the viral release, indicating that ISGylation of target proteins, but not ISG15 itself, is required for the inhibition of Gag ubiquitination, although ISGylation of either Gag or Tsg101 could not be detected. Thus, ISGylation of certain unknown viral and/or host proteins appears to play a critical role in the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 assembly and release.",

Ebola virus is a member of the Filoviral family of negative-sense RNA viruses. The VP40 matrix protein is a key structural protein that is critical for the virion release. The efficient budding of VLPs requires the interaction of overlapping L-domains (late-budding domains) in the VP40 protein with Nedd4, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, as well as with other members of the ESCRT pathway (e.g., Tsg101) [137], [138], [139], [140]. ISG15 overexpression decreases not only the level of VP40 detected in VLPs but also the levels of endogenous Nedd4 incorporated into budding VP40 VLPs. Nedd4 interacts with and is conjugated by ISG15. Moreover, ISG15 overexpression blocks the ability of Nedd4 to ubiquitinate VP40, leading to the prevention of L-domain-mediated budding of VP40 VLPs. In addition, it has been shown that free ISG15 specifically binds to Nedd4 and inhibits the interaction of the E3 ligase with ubiquitin E2 enzymes (e.g., UbcH6), thus preventing the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzymes to Nedd4 [26]. These findings reveal a mechanism for the antiviral function of ISG15 that involves the ISGylation and inactivation of the host Nedd4 E3 ligase.",

Therefore, an important issue is how the small fractions of ISGylated proteins, including IRF-3, can exert their biological functions. It has been proposed that if the small fractions of proteins that are modified by Ubls (e.g., SUMO and ISG15) are localized to some functionally unique cellular site or the transient modification is sufficient to switch the protein into new state, their functions could efficiently operate [124], [142], [143]. Intriguingly, overexpression of ISG15 leads to the appearance of IRF-3 as punctates in the nucleus [141]. This nuclear retention could allow IRF-3 to exert its profound antiviral function, although only a small portion of IRF-3 is ISGylated upon the viral infection. An additional example is that upon overexpression of filamin B, UbcH8 is recruited to membrane ruffles where filamin B is also concentrated with actin [123], [125]. This recruitment of UbcH8, which otherwise resides throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus, should allow the E2 enzyme to efficiently function in filamin B ISGylation and thus in desensitization of type I IFN-induced JNK signaling (see above).",

Upon stimuli, NO as well as the products generated by its interaction with ROS, such as peroxynitrite and peroxynitrous acid, are accumulated and utilized for the antibacterial or antiviral effects [144], [145], [146]. NO is also covalently attached to the thiol group of cysteine residues of proteins, causing their S-nitrosylation. This posttranslational modification serves as an important mechanism that mediates antibacterial and antiviral effects through the alteration in enzymatic activity, protein\u2013protein interaction, and signal transduction [147]. Interestingly, the cysteine residue in ISG15 can also be modified by NO and this S-nitrosylation decreases the dimerization of ISG15, thereby increasing the availability as well as the solubility of monomeric ISG15 for its conjugation to cellular proteins [148]. Moreover, treatment with S-ethylisothiourea, an iNOS inhibitor, reduces the level of ISG15 conjugates, whereas overexpression of iNOS increases it. Thus, iNOS may play a role in the enhancement of innate immune responses by mediating ISG15 S-nitrosylation.",

Intracellular dsRNA activates NF-\u03baB and IRF-3/IRF-7 through RIG-I and the mitochondrial adaptor protein IFN promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) [156], [157], [158], [159]. Furthermore, RIG-I is a target protein for ISGylation [115], [160]. However, ISGylation of RIG-I leads to a reduction in the levels of both basal and virus-induced IFN production. Consistently, the basal mRNA and protein levels of RIG-I are significantly higher in UBE1L\n\u2212\n/\n\u2212 cells than in UBE1L\n+/+ cells. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that a negative feedback loop is operating for fine-tuning the strength of RIG-I-mediated signaling to maintain a balance between innate immune response and hypersensitivity during antiviral responses. In addition, ubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25 is required to mediate antiviral signaling responses, whereas that by RNF125 results in the proteasomal degradation of RIG-I [161].

Influenza B virus strongly induces ISG15 during infection but specifically blocks ISGylation of host proteins [18]. This inhibition is mediated by the viral NS1B protein, which interacts with ISG15 and prevents the generation of ISG15 conjugates under in vitro conditions as well as in infected cells (Fig. 4). Purified NS1B inhibits the formation of ISG15-UBE1L-like thioester intermediate. ISG15 conjugates accumulate in IFN-treated cells, but not in cells infected by influenza B virus, although similar amounts of ISG15 are synthesized in both cells. Moreover, ISG15 conjugates are not detectable in cells infected with the virus expressing full-length NS1B but are markedly accumulated in cells infected with the virus expressing truncated NS1B, which cannot bind to ISG15, indicating that the interaction of NS1B with ISG15 is responsible for the inhibition of ISG15 conjugation and thus of the antiviral function of ISG15.",

RIG-I signaling induces a host response that controls HCV RNA replication [165]. However, HCV can evade this response in part through its ability to antagonize the relay of RIG-I signaling to IRF-3 [166]. NS3/4A, a major serine protease expressed by HCV [164], cleaves IPS-1, causing the release of cleaved IPS-1 from the mitochondrial membrane [167], [168]. This cleavage results in the subcellular redistribution of IPS-1 and loss of its interaction with RIG-I, thereby preventing downstream activation of IRF-3 and IFN\u03b2 induction. Intriguingly, in liver tissues chronically infected by HCV, the IPS-1 cleavage and its subcellular redistribution are associated with the lack of ISG15 and its conjugates. Among the HCV-infected tissues, ISG15 and its conjugates can be detected only in the liver from patients, which has predominantly uncleaved, full-length IPS-1 protein. These findings indicate that NS3/4A plays a critical role in evading the host antiviral response by attenuating the IFN amplification loop of RIG-I and thus the expression of ISGs, including ISG15, which are normally induced by RIG-I- and IRF-3-dependent pathways.",

Furthermore, treatment with lactacystin, an inhibitor of the proteasome, shows little or no effect on the level of ISG15 conjugates in either of UBP43\n+/+ or UBP43\n\u2212\n/\n\u2212 cells whether or not exposed to IFN\u03b2, while as expected the level of ubiquitinated proteins markedly increases in both cells.

One possibility is that the elevated expression of ISG15 may be due to constitutively activated NF-\u03baB in many tumor cells. This possibility is supported by an observation that ISG15-overexpressing ZR-75-1 cells show a greater NF-\u03baB activity than ISG15-underexpressing BT474 breast cancer cells [176]. Alternatively, the deregulated expression of UBE1L and UBP43 in certain tumors could contribute to the variation in the levels of ISG15 conjugates in tumor biopsy samples.",

Significantly, UBE1L and UbcH8 are upregulated in prostate cancer lesions as compared to those in corresponding nonmalignant tissues [179]. Moreover, overexpression of UBE1L in LNCaP cells leads to a marked increase in the mRNA and protein levels of androgen receptor in addition to an increase in the rate of cell proliferation. On the other hand, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ISG15 and UBE1L in LNCaP cells results in a significant decrease in the transcript and protein levels of androgen receptor. These findings suggest that ISGylation machinery participates in a positive control of androgen receptor expression during the onset of prostate cancers, thereby promoting the tumor growth.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of IFNs, a vast knowledge on the role of the cytokines in innate immune responses has been accumulated. ISG15 is one of the most strongly induced ISGs upon exposure to type I IFNs, virus, LPS, and other stresses, including certain genotoxic stresses [16], [17], [35], [56], [64], [180]. Considering that type I IFNs play critical roles in innate immune responses regulating the antiviral responses as well as the cancer development, there is no doubt that ISG15 and its conjugation to target proteins play critical roles in the type I IFN-induced immune responses. However, the biological significance of protein modification by ISG15 has been established only in several cases. Therefore, much studies are required for clarification of the role of ISG15 in innate immune responses against viral infection and cancer and thus for the control of immune diseases as well as for resolving the contradictory findings, such as the role of ISG15 as a tumor suppressor versus an oncogenic protein.",
