Uncontrolled bleeding is the second most common cause of death, and hemorrhage is directly responsible for 40 % of all trauma-related deaths [2] . Coagulopathy can be detected with standard coagulation tests immediately after arrival in the emergency room (ER) in approximately 25 -35 % of all trauma patients [1, 2] . Moreover, early trauma-induced coagulopathy is associated with a 4-fold increase in mortality [1] . Blood coagulation monitoring is essential in order to assess the underlying coagulation disorder and to tailor hemostatic treatment. Thromboelastometry (TEM) and thrombelastography (TEG) are promising point-of-care technologies providing rapid information on the initiation process of clot formation, clot quality, and stability of the clot [3] .",

This combined coagulation therapy can be guided by TEM and TEG test results, allowing the optimization of hemostasis in trauma cases on an individualized basis [4] .

In shock, high amounts of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are released from endothelial cells and thrombomodulin is expressed on their surface. Thrombomodulin binds thrombin and subsequently activates the protein C pathway. Protein C together with its cofactor, protein S, slows down the accelerators of the coagulation process by inactivating FVIIIa and FVa. Furthermore, high amounts of protein C consume plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), the major antagonist of t-PA. As a consequence, overwhelming amounts of t-PA are available, creating a profibrinolytic state [5] . The overall incidence of hyperfibrinolysis is still unclear. Fibrinolysis, according to TEM/TEG test results in two small studies, was observed in 2.5 % and 8.7 %, respectively, of all trauma patients [6, 7] . However, in major trauma the incidence seems to be higher. This is especially true in patients with severe shock who require catecholamines or vasopressin for blood pressure stabilization and are prone to hyperfibrinolysis. In summary, hyperfibrinolysis is more common than previously assumed and associated with a poor outcome [8] .",

It is undisputed that dilution of the remaining coagulation factors is an inevitable consequence when intravascular volume is restored.

This is in part related to aggressive pre-hospital volume replacement. Patients from this study received a mean of 2200 ml of fluid, but 50 % of patients received more than 3000 ml [9] . Whereas volume resuscitation using crystalloids may result in dilutional coagulopathy, in vitro studies revealed that colloids impair the fibrin polymerization process to an extent which is greater than the dilutional effect alone [10, 11] .",

Consequently, consumption of coagulation factors primarily affects fibrinogen.

In elective surgery, it was demonstrated that fibrinogen was the first coagulation factor reaching critical levels [13] . In severe trauma patients with a mean injury severity score (ISS) of 35, fibrinogen concentration decreased from 1.6 g in the field to 0.95 g on admission to the emergency room [14] . In an observational study (n = 161), Carroll and colleagues reported that 11 % of patients had a fibrinogen concentration of less than 1.0 g on admission to the ER, but contributed 31 % of all fatalities [6] . Since fibrinogen plays a central role in hemostasis it is obvious that a decrease in fibrinogen concentrations results in decreased clot stability and increased bleeding [15] .",

Wang and collaborators reported data from more than 38,000 trauma patients and found that admission hypothermia was independently associated with an increased odds of death in patients admitted with low core temperature [16] . An explanation for this finding could be that body temperature of less than 34\u00b0C is associated with increased bleeding. Jurkovic et al. found that mortality of hypothermic patients was significantly higher than those who remained warm. In patients, who arrived in the ER with a core temperature of less than 32\u00b0C 100 % mortality was observed [17] . Hypothermia compromises primary as well as secondary hemostasis and enhances clot lysis. However, these effects are of clinical relevance only at temperatures of less than 34\u00b0C. At temperatures of 33\u00b0C thrombin generation is markedly affected and platelet adhesion is diminished in the range of 33 % of normal [18] .",

However, irrespective of the need for faster testing procedures, these tests may have limited value for the assessment of coagulopathy and for guidance of hemostatic therapy. In vivo coagulation occurs primarily on the surface of platelets and TF-bearing cells [27] . Fibrinogen and platelets are tightly interwoven and RBCs also play a significant role in hemostasis [28] . However, these cells are removed by the centrifugation process. In addition, conventional tests stop with the formation of the first fibrin strands, when only approximately 5 % of thrombin has been generated [29] . These assays only provide information about the beginning of clotting and do not assess the quality and strength of the clot. Furthermore, the influence of (hyper)fibrinolysis on clot stability cannot be evaluated by routine coagulation tests [30] . Preoperative PT and aPTT testing has little predictive value for bleeding, while tests performed intraoperatively and postoperatively are of little value for identifying the cause of bleeding [24] . Obtaining test results, including fibrinogen concentration, is time consuming and of little use for the guidance of emergency hemostatic therapy. Furthermore, Fenger-Eriksen et al. demonstrated that different automated coagulation analyzers revealed significantly different levels of fibrinogen [31] . The presence of colloid plasma expander gave rise to erroneously high levels of fibrinogen recorded by some coagulation analyzers employing the Clauss method, overestimating levels by 80 % and 110 % in cases of 30 % and 50 % dilution, respectively (though in the absence of such confounders this method is reliable) [31, 32] .",

In the pre-hospital phase, fluid resuscitation should be minimized to what is necessary to maintain adequate vital signs and avoid hypovolemic cardiac arrest. The concept of deliberated hypotension is well accepted although the scientific basis is poor and only very limited data are available in the literature. Fluid resuscitation should preserve vital functions without increasing the risk of further rebleeding. Experimental studies employing an uncontrolled bleeding model revealed improved survival in animals that were fluid resuscitated to low blood pressure thresholds [38] . In a pig study of uncontrolled bleeding, an aortotomy of 2 mm was performed in the infrarenal aorta. With a drop in blood pressure, initial hemorrhage stopped spontaneously. Fluid resuscitation resulted in rebleeding with an increase 616 H. Schoechl, W. Voelckel, and C. Solomon in blood pressure (average systolic pressure of 94 \" 3 mmHg) [39] . In one prehospital study, restrictive fluid replacement in patients with penetrating trauma resulted in improved outcome [40] . Dutton et al. reported that an intra-operative targeted systolic blood pressure as low as 70 mmHg reduced the time of active bleeding compared with a systolic blood pressure around 100 mmHg (2.4 h vs. 2.9 h, respectively) in severely injured patients.

In summary, the lowest acceptable blood pressure level and how long such a targeted low blood pressure can be tolerated are still unknown. This level is also influenced by pre-existing conditions, like coronary artery disease or stroke, which have to be taken into account.",

Additionally a survivor bias must be considered. Patients with massive, uncontrollable bleeding died before large amounts of FFP could be infused. Therefore, non-survivors received a lower FFP:RBC. In the only prospective study, Scalea et al, reported no survival benefit for higher FFP:RBC ratios when early deaths were excluded [48] . In another study, Snyder et al. [49] calculated regression models to correct survivorship bias. Mortality in the group with high FFP:RBC ratios (> 1:2) was compared with that in the group with low ratios (< 1:2). The high ratio resulted in better survival at 24 hours when a fixed FFP:RBC ratio was given. This survival advantage disappeared when the ratio was treated as a time-dependent variable (relative risk = 0.84, 95 % CI = 0.47 to 1.5) ( Table 2) . These studies highlight a problem regarding how the length of time taken to administer RBC or FFP affects the real ratios of transfused products. It is incumbent upon the scientific community to define a period of time in which it is acceptable to assume a ratio of 1:1 RBC:FFP administration. The authors believe that for units of these products to be considered equal they must be transfused within 30 minutes of each other.",

A massive time delay in FFP transfusion was also reported by Riskin and colleagues [53] . These authors reviewed data on trauma patients requiring 10 or more RBC units during the first 24 hours of admission for a period of two years before and after the establishment of a massive transfusion protocol. The FFP:RBC ratios were identical in the two phases (1:1.8 and 1:1.8, p = 0.97). Despite the similar FFP:RBC ratios and overall mean numbers of transfusions, mortality decreased from 45 % to 19 % (p = 0.02). A significant finding in this study was that the mean time to the administration of the first FFP was decreased from 254 to 169 minutes (p = 0.04) in the second part of the study. This study highlighted a significant reduction in mortality despite unchanged FFP:RBC ratios and equivalent overall mean numbers of transfusions, which underscores the importance of timely substitution of coagulation factors. The low volume of clotting factor concentrates offers the benefit of significant time savings when supplementing clotting factors. For example, fibrinogen concentrates are able to provide up to 6 g of fibrinogen in 1 -2 minutes [54] , which would be impossible to achieve using FFP.",

Accordingly thrombin generation per se is not an initial problem at the early stage of injury but later on in the course of trauma management [65] . An improvement in thrombin generation can be achieved by administration of FFP, rFVIIa and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). PCC is a virally-inactivated plasma product containing the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X), the inhibitor proteins, C, S and Z, and small amounts of antithrombin. To prevent activation of the coagulation factors, most PCCs contain heparin as well. PCCs may be beneficial in patients with massive bleeding who require immediate therapy of the coagulation defect. In situations where prothrombin complex factors are deficient, such as patients receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy, PCCs should be administered in line with current guidelines [66, 67] . The products are well standardized and are licensed in Europe for use in the reversal of vitamin K antagonist therapy, the treatment of acquired bleeding and as prophylactic therapy for perioperative bleeding.

Thrombin production can be further accelerated on the surface of activated platelets by rFVIIa. However, in cases of depleted levels of factor II (FII), such as dilutional coagulopathy, the substrate required for thrombin generation is lacking and a beneficial effect of rFVIIa administration is mitigated. rFVIIa initially requires available FII and subsequently fibrinogen and platelets to stimulate coagulation. rFVIIa is currently licensed for the management of patients with hemophilia A and B who develop inhibitors to exogenously administered factor concentrates, and in some countries for deficiencies of FVII and Glanzmanns thrombasthenia. The results of two randomized controlled trials in bleeding trauma patients treated with rFVIIa are available. In the first study a reduction of 2.6 RBC transfusions was observed when rFVIIa had been administered [70] . In penetrating trauma patients, rFVIIa resulted only in a reduction of 1 RBC transfusion [70] . The second study was terminated after inclusion of 573 of 1502 planned patients because of unexpected low mortality in the placebo group and difficulties in the enrolment of patients [71] . The data collected to this point showed a mortality of 11.0 % (rFVIIa group) versus 10.7 % (placebo group) (p = 0.93) in blunt trauma and 18.2 % (rFVIIa group) versus 13.2 % (placebo group) (p = 0.40) after penetrating injuries. rFVIIa patients with blunt trauma received a mean of 7.8 \u00b1 10.6 RBC units and 19.0 \u00b1 27.1 total allogeneic units through 48 hours, whereas placebo patients received 9.1 \u00b1 11.3 RBC units (p = 0.04) and 23.5 \u00b1 28.0 total allogeneic units (p = 0.04).

Ratio driven resuscitation protocols with a high ratio of FFP:RBC revealed improved survival in military and civilian trauma care. In contrast, goal-directed coagulation therapy focuses on the actual demand of the patient and individualizes coagulation therapy. A modern monitoring device delivering prompt and reliable data about the actual coagulation status of the patient is essential for this approach. Hence, it follows that the most modern therapeutics available, coagulation factor concentrates, would be used predominantly.
