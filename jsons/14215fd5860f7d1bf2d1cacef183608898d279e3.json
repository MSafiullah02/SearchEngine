            "text": "A 59-year-old male from an endemic area for COVID-19 in Northern Italy presented to the hospital with dyspnea and chest pain. On physical examination, his temperature was 36.9 degrees Celsius and electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads V2-V3. The blood tests showed leukopenia (3800 cells/\u00b5L) and troponin I increase (73 ng/mL). Chest x-ray showed no pathological findings. Due to the COVID-19 emergency, a large-scale hub-and spoke model was developed in the Lombardy region in order to select dedicated cardiology centers for management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) to support other general hospitals which were converted to only treat COVID-19 patients (1) . In agreement with this model, the patient was transferred to our hospital where he received a nasopharyngeal swab that tested positive for SARS-CoV2. He subsequently underwent invasive coronary angiography in a dedicated catheterization laboratory for COVID patients demonstrating normal coronary arteries with a final diagnosis of myocardial injury with non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Although CMR was considered for further evaluation, it was not performed due to equipment and room cleaning and disinfection issues. The day after admission, his dyspnea worsened. In order to evaluate for lung infection, pulmonary embolism and myocardial injury, as suspected by biomarker elevation, a modified scan protocol including a nonenhanced acquisition followed by ECG triggered contrast enhanced CT with delayed acquisition was performed. The pre-contrast CT showed scattered patchy ground-glass The Lombardy region in northern Italy is one of the area with the highest number of COVID-19. Comparing the period between February 15 th to March 20 th 2020 with the same period last year, we observed a significant increase of ACS with no obstructive coronary artery disease (27% vs 4%, p<0.01). Recent reports suggest that acute cardiac injury is present in ~7% of patients with COVID-19 and may be related to myocarditis. Although CMR is known to be highly effective in identifying the underlying diagnosis beyond MINOCA, some concerns related to equipment and room cleaning and disinfection should be considered in COVID-19 patients. Recently, CCT has showed the ability to detect myocardial damage (2,3) through late iodine enhanced scans. A lesson from this case is that in COVID-19 patients with equivocal ACS presentation who are hemodynamically stable, CCT could be considered to rule out CAD as alternative to invasive coronary angiography. Moreover, additional information to rule out interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and myocarditis could be obtained with dedicated protocol acquisition in a new concept of \"quadruple rule out\". However, the potential renal injury related to the higher amount of contrast agent required to this aim should be carefully evaluated on a case by case basis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report showing the use of CCT as part of a comprehensive cardio-pulmonary assessment during COVID-19 pandemic. ",

The patient was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (2 tablets of 200/50 mg twice daily), hydroxychloroquine (200 mg/twice/day) with a progressive clinical improvement. At the time of submission, the patient was still hospitalized to finish the quarantine period.",
