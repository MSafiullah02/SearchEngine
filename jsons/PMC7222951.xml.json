The children were born at William Beaumont Hospital (WBH), Royal Oak, MI, in 2007\u20132012, and treated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). At WBH-NICU resuscitation is attempted for all infants with an estimated gestational age \u2265 23 0/7 weeks (Batton et al. 2011). Children with congenital anomalies, or who required mechanical ventilation after discharge, were excluded from the retrospectively identified NICU cohort matching our inclusion criteria. The families of 41.63% of 860 cases could still be reached for recruitment attempt based on contact information provided at the time of birth (see Online Resource 1). Of these, families of 38.27% cases were not interested, for multiple reasons. In accord with WBH Human Investigation Committee guidelines nonparticipating families were not specifically queried, yet amongst common reasons spontaneously provided by families for nonparticipation were being \u201ctoo busy\u201d, residing too far away or not wanting to travel from suburban areas to the city. Families of 51 additional cases (14.24% of those successfully contacted) \u201cno-showed\u201d for the schedule assessment twice and were not rescheduled. The 170 available participants constituted 51.20% of the pool of cases whose families could be contacted between 3 and 4 years of age.",

Altogether 160 cases were available for this study (see Table 1 for sociodemographic characteristics). As the table shows, our sample included participants from a very broad socioeconomic range. Nonetheless, the relatively high mean SES (48.6 of 66 possible points; SD = 10.00) reflects the composition of the catchment area of WBH. This region includes primarily middle social strata, thereby minimizing the possibility of confounding the effects of antenatal risk with other adverse environmental factors associated with socioeconomic status. Correspondingly, about 85% of NICU admissions were covered by private medical insurance and only 15% by Medicaid. Additionally, 78.1% of the mothers and 62.3% of the fathers attained a college degree. The final sample included 75 (46.9%) boys and 28 (17.5%) participants of African-American descent.",

Specifically: hypertensive disorders (Maher et al. 2017), IUGR (Morsing et al. 2011), hemolysis, elevated Liver enzymes, and low platelet count [HELLP] syndrome (Barnhart 2015), hypothyroidism (Andersen et al. 2018, and Liu et al. 2018), diabetes (Fraser et al. 2012), chorioamnionitis (Yellowhair et al. 2018), preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; Pinto et al. 2018), placental abruption (Downes et al. 2017) and placenta previa (Weiner et al. 2016).

In contrast, singleton children or multiples without an evaluated co-multiple had no replicates and were considered random block with size 1.

Follow-up analyses were conducted to explore whether any observed associations between antenatal risk and kindergarten readiness were attributable to a particular class of complications. Hence we grouped the nine antenatal complications comprising the summary score (Table 2) into four categories. These four groupings were based on shared etiological pathways, or shared antepartum symptoms coupled with at least some shared antecedents. Specifically, complications associated with either (1). intra-amniotic infection and inflammation (histologic chorioamnionitis and membranes ruptured >12 h; e.g., Stock et al. 2015); (2). placental insufficiency (hypertension in pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, and IUGR; e.g., Stepan et al. 2005); (3). maternal endocrine dysfunction (hypothyroid and diabetes; e.g., Haddow et al. 2016) or (4). uteroplacental bleeding (abruption and previa; e.g., Berhan 2014; Getahun et al. 2006). Category scores were then assigned to participants based on the sum of complications accumulated within each class of antenatal risk.

These findings are compatible with recent evidence that inflammation, including chorioamnionitis, contributes to preterm CNS injury and is also an independent risk factor for brain injury in the term infant (Yellowhair et al. 2018). These results are also consistent with reports of marked increase in the probability of unexplained cerebral palsy in the presence of antenatal inflammation-infection (Horvath et al. 2012). In this context, one should note that a sizeable proportion of the mothers in our sample received antibiotics prophylaxis for prevention of early onset neonatal infection (see Online Resource 2). In a recent integrative review of the literature, Braye et al. (2018) highlighted the observed decrease in incidence of early onset infection since the introduction of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as findings of randomized controlled studies documenting effectiveness. At the same time, however, Braye and colleagues emphasized that the longer-term health implications of prophylaxis for early onset infection are unknown. It is difficult, therefore, if not impossible, to draw conclusions regarding the potential implications of antibiotic prophylaxis on kindergarten readiness until such data become available. Nonetheless, our findings revealed that each of the four classes of antenatal risk studied here contributed significantly to explaining performance variance on one or more kindergarten readiness domains. The putative influence of each antenatal risk category on brain maturation trajectory and cognitive-behavioral development may be conceptualized within the broad framework of fetal programming of disease (Buss et al. 2012; Zeltser and Leibel 2011; Myatt 2006; Andersen et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2016; Godfrey 2002). However, the biological mechanisms mediating the relationship between cumulative antenatal risk and kindergarten readiness require specification. Antenatal stressors lead to placental adaptive responses to the variations in the maternal-fetal environment (Myatt 2006). These responses, in turn, are followed by fetal adaptations expressed via vascular, metabolic or endocrine changes that permanently modify bodily structure or function (Hocher et al. 2001). The precise nature and sequence of the biological changes mediating deficits in cognitive-behavioral functioning have yet to be elucidated. To accomplish this goal, future investigations should incorporate measures of potential sequential mediators, including indexes of placental size or function, intrauterine cerebral development, and postnatal brain structure or function.",

            "text": "Antenatal complications contributed less than SES to explaining outcome variance, although effect magnitude was typically moderate for both variables. Girls outperformed boys on all measures, consistent with other reports of female outcome advantage following preterm birth (Lauterbach et al. 2001). Similar to Foster-Cohen et al. (2010), we did not find significant associations between the sum of perinatal complications and kindergarten readiness in this young age group. However, gestational age, often considered a proxy for perinatal risk, was found to be linked to development of visual-motor integration skills even after we excluded cases with evidence of significant brain injury from the analyses. Additionally, there was a weak trend (p < 0.15; Table 3) for a relationship between gestational age and global intellectual skills. The absence of the oft-reported significant relationships between the degree of prematurity and the remaining outcome measures (e.g., Heuvelman et al. 2018; a recent epidemiological investigation) was somewhat unexpected. It is possible that within a restricted gestational age range, where values \u226534 weeks were truncated, the relationships between gestational age and preschool performance are more difficult to demonstrate whereas the adverse influence of other risk factors (e.g., antenatal complications) becomes more apparent. Interestingly, the absence of gestational age effects on several performance measures employed here seems consistent with findings from a recent meta-analysis of the long-term cognitive and academic performance of children born with various degrees of prematurity (Allotey et al. 2018). The quantitative integration revealed a miniscule, if any, effect of lower gestational age. Children born between 28 and 34 weeks performed almost as poorly as those born <28 weeks.",

The percentage of missing outcome data for the 148 children without significant neurological injury completing \u2265 one task ranged from negligible (0.06%) for cognitive readiness (FSIQ) to moderate (9.45%) for numerical readiness (AP). The amount of missing data for three of the four outcome measures was nonetheless small (< 5.0%). Although our sample included children with a wide range of socioeconomic circumstances, the mean SES and educational characteristics of the sample revealed a greater representation of middle-class strata, thereby reducing the potentially confounding effects of socioeconomic adversity on kindergarten readiness. Nonetheless, because to some extent generalizability to lower strata was traded-off for improved internal validity, our findings may have underestimated statistical effects in samples with greater representation of the lower end of the socioeconomic scale.

Antenatal risk estimation was based on a simple frequency count of common complications. A more sensitive measure of risk may be developed to take the severity of discrete complications within each of the four antenatal risk categories examined here into account. Increased sensitivity, in turn, may serve to enhance the magnitude of the statistical effects observed here between antenatal risk and emergent academic skills. As noted above, we statistically adjusted for degree of gestational maturity and for the presence of nine common perinatal risk factors (Table 2) in order to estimate the unique portion of outcome variance that is attributable to cumulative antenatal risk. We further examined the data with and without \u2018neurological\u2019 cases, based on both ultrasound evidence obtained in the NICU and subsequent evidence of cerebral palsy. Nonetheless, one may argue that the full effect of confounding perinatal risk factors such as chronic lung disease or germinal matrix hemorrhage may become evident in the longer term only, when academic performance demands are increased. A longitudinal study of educational attainment is best suited to address this issue.",

Moreover, developmental continuity has been demonstrated between preschool quantitative and oral-language skills and elementary school attainment in math and reading, in a variety of student populations (e.g., Davison et al. 2011; Manfra et al. 2014; Manfra et al. 2017; Nguyen et al. 2016). The existence of robust developmental continuity between pre-academic and academic skill levels supports the notion that the same factors that explain variability in emergent academic skills also account for variability in mastery of both the reading process and basic arithmetic in the early elementary-school years. Based on our findings, it is therefore likely that differences in scholastic achievement among graduates of the NICU are partly explained by cumulative antenatal risk. A follow-up study of preterm-born preschoolers, extending to early school-age and beyond, will be needed to support this thesis.",
