Teele et al. [2] have shown that by the age of 1 year, more than 60% of children have had at least one episode of acute otitis media (AOM), and by the age of 3 years, more than 40% of children have experienced more than three episodes of AOM. In fact, $3 to $4 billion are spent annually on the medical and surgical treatment of AOM alone [3] . Although antibiotics are the primary treatment for most patients with AOM, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated a relatively modest (13.7%) benefit from this therapy [4] . In addition, ever-growing antibiotic resistance patterns are making therapy for OM significantly more difficult [5] . Concomitant viral infection in cases of AOM has also been proposed as a reason for failure of antibacterial therapy [6] . Moreover, children with hearing loss as a result of prolonged bouts of OM might experience significant problems with speech and language acquisition [7] . There is no question that a better understanding of the pathophysiologic and molecular mechanisms relating viral URIs and AOM will lead to the development of new therapeutic alternatives. Today, a significant number of alternative therapies exist for the treatment of OM. However, the role of these interventions in the setting of viral OM is unclear.",

Furthermore, Finnish studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between monthly episodes of AOM and the seasonal occurrence of viral URIs [9] . Specific viruses isolated from the upper respiratory tract during episodes of AOM include: influenza (INF) A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, mumps virus, coronavirus, enteroviruses, and the rhinoviruses (RV), with RSV being the most frequent. Although the reasons for the apparent increased association between RSV-mediated URIs and AOM remains unknown, this finding might be related to the timing of the studies during RSV epidemics or the variation in the sensitivities of methods of viral detection [10, 11] . Another potential interpretation is that RSV is more otologically virulent than other viruses [12\u2022 ].",

However, clinical and human experimental investigations suggest that the temporal association between viral URIs and episodes of AOM represents a causal relationship. Using either RSVenriched globulin or inactivated, live, attenuated INF vaccines, significant reductions in the incidence of AOM in selected pediatric populations have been achieved [13-16,17\u2022] . Moreover, in human viral challenge experiments, as many as 20% of individuals infected with one of the common respiratory viruses (INF, RV, or RSV) developed OM following nasal inoculation. In contrast to the epidemiologic findings mentioned, comparative analysis between the various virus-infected groups has shown that INF A infection is significantly more likely to result in OM than are either RSV or RV [18] [19] [20] . These studies and others indicate a clear, causal role for viral URIs in the pathogenesis of AOM. There-Acute otitis media (AOM) and viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) represent the two most common diseases affecting the human population, and account for substantial patient morbidity and health care costs. Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that URIs play a causal role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Specifically, viruses can either invade the middle ear (ME) space and invoke an inflammatory response that culminates in ME effusion formation and consequent symptoms, or URIs might cause eustachian-tube dysfunction, resulting in negative ME pressures and subsequent ME effusion (hydrops ex vacuo theory). The events responsible for the inflammatory response of the human ME following viral exposure have not been well characterized. Although many prophylactic and therapeutic interventions have been evaluated for the treatment of AOM, the information on virusspecific interventions is sparse. In this article, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of viral otitis media are reviewed.",

For example, Ruuskanen et al. [9] summarized the results of 15 studies using either standard culture techniques or virus-specific antigen detection methods. In these studies, which were performed between 1955 and 1988, 10% (n = 1221; range 0 to 55%) of ME effusions were positive for, at least, one of the respiratory viruses during episodes of AOM.

In an INF A human challenge experiment in Pittsburgh, RT-PCR was used to identify INF A RNA (and Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA) in the ME effusion of a subject with culture-negative AOM [18] . This study clearly demonstrated that INF virus was present in the ME space at some time prior to myringotomy. Similar RT-PCR findings for bacterial positivity have indicated active, ongoing infection rather than persistence of archival genomic material [22] .

During naturally occurring URIs, abnormal ME pressures and ET dysfunction have been documented using standard testing protocols [23] . To further study the effects of viruses on the ET-ME system, human and animal experimental systems were developed. In humans, intranasal inoculation of healthy adult volunteers with RV type 39, RV Hanks, INF A, or RSV can reliably result in ET-opening failure, abnormal ME pressures, and AOM [18, 19, 24, 25] . The temporal pattern of the observed otologic consequences (ie, ET obstruction > ME underpressure > OM) suggests a causal mechanism. That is, viral URIs disrupt normal ET-opening function, which results in ME underpressures, and subsequent ME effusion formation. Because the ME is essentially a noncollapsible gas pocket, ME underpressures are thought to predispose to effusion formation by either aspiration of infectious nasopharyngeal secretions through the ET, with consequent exudation (ie, inflammation) or underpressure-induced transudation (ie, hydrops ex vacuo theory).",

Interestingly, in a finding similar to a previous human study, ascension of both adenovirus and nontypeable H. influenzae through the ET to the ME was reported following intranasal inoculation [18, 30] . A similar synergistic relationship could not be documented for coinfection with adenovirus type 1 and Moraxella catarrhalis using the same chinchilla model [31] . Using an intrabullar inoculation model, Chung et al.

Explanations for these findings include viral effect on neutrophil function, local reactions interfering with antibiotic concentrations, and the induction of inflammatory mediators with enhancement of the degree of inflammation [32] . The mechanisms of these interactions might be nonspecific, but in some cases appear to be pathogen specific. The association between INF A and pneumonia secondary to S. pneumoniae has long been recognized. This association has also been demonstrated in experimental OM, as previously described [18] . The tendency of these two pathogens to cause coinfection might, in part, be explained by the changes in the binding capacity of nasopharyngeal and ET epithelial cells [33] . Hirano et al. [34] recently recognized changes in lectin-binding properties of murine nasopharyngeal mucosa in mice inoculated with INF A. Cultures from the nasopharynx of these mice suggested that alteration in the glycoconjugate structure lining the nasopharyngeal mucosa is associated with a reduction in bacterial clearance. These studies demonstrate a method by which a virus enhances the pathogenicity of a specific bacteria rather than simply enhancing a nonspecific inflammatory response.",

In 13 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of AOM by 0.12 episodes per patient-month [35] . Given the rising incidence of antibiotic resistance and the modest benefit observed with prophylaxis, it seems prudent to limit antibiotic prophylaxis to high-risk individuals.

Therefore, the administration of the INF vaccine resulted in a 36% reduction in the incidence of AOM from all causes. Clements et al. [15] vaccinated children aged 6 to 30 months and found a 32% reduction in the incidence of AOM during the INF season and a 28% reduction in the incidence of serous OM. More recently, Marchisio et al.

No difference was seen in the incidence of afebrile AOM. The attenuated vaccine has some advantages in that it generates a broader immune response with greater longevity.

However, the risks of adenoidectomy limit its use to more severely affected patients-that is, those patients of appropriate age who have failed primary tympanostomy tube placement, and those patients categorized as high-risk, as described earlier. In general, surgical prophylaxis of AOM is reserved for those patients who fail medical therapy, or those patients categorized as high-risk. Given the encouraging results from clinical trials with the INF vaccine, vaccination should be considered during the appropriate season in children who have significant recurrent AOM but do not meet criteria for surgical prophylaxis. Both surgical and medical prophylaxis should be considered when indicated for high-risk patients.",

Currently, there is no viral-specific therapy available; therefore, a discussion of the treatment of viral AOM essentially relies on information derived from the treatment of all cases of AOM. The goals of treatment of AOM include symptomatic relief, prevention of complications, and clearance of effusion with normalization of hearing. In general, therapeutic decisions should be made on an individual basis, with high-risk patients requiring more aggressive intervention. Any treatment of AOM must be evaluated against the natural history of the disease. Placebo-treated, nonsevere OM demonstrates a spontaneous resolution of pain and fever by 4 to 7 days in up to 88% of children [50] . Clinical resolution of all signs and symptoms occurs in 73% of children by 7 to 14 days. The only exception is ME fluid, with 47% clearing fluid by 2 weeks, 60% by 1 month, and 75% by 3 months. Given this high rate of spontaneous resolution, it is difficult to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions in cases of AOM without studies involving very large numbers of patients.",

Placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrate significant symptom relief using antibiotics at 2 to 7 days, with a 13% improvement in complete clinical resolution [51, 52] . It should be noted that these trials exclude highrisk children. The dramatic decrease in incidence of suppurative complications since the advent of antibiotics lends additional support of the theory that antibiotics play a major role in AOM. Given that pain is a major component of the morbidity of AOM, analgesic therapy seems to be beneficial.",

The use of steroids, both intranasal and systemic, in the setting of OME is controversial. A recent review of clinical trials concluded that although steroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic might lead to a more rapid resolution of OME in the shortterm, there is no evidence of a long-term benefit [53] . More trials are necessary to determine the role of steroids in AOM; however, the risks of systemic steroids would probably outweigh any benefit that might be obtained over antibiotics alone. The use of systemic decongesants and antihistamines for the treatment of AOM has been extensively studied, and there appears to be no benefit for the use of these medications in this setting [54] .",
