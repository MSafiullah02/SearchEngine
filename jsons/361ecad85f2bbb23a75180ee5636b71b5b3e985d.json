C In a patient with closed head injury, one should avoid ketamine because it increases intracranial pressure, possibly through a cholinergic mechanism. In a setting of hypotension and shock, thiopental, particularly in the usual dose of 2-4 mg, should be avoided because it may potentiate hypotension, which might be detrimental to the patient. Vecuronium seems to cause minimal hemodynamic disturbances, and therefore, in combination with lidocaine and low-dose (1-2 mg/kg) thiopental would be the most appropriate combination in this patient.

D With turbulent airflow, the resistance to airflow is proportionate to density. A helium-O 2 (HeliOx) mixture has a lower density than an O 2 -nitrogen mixture. This leads to a reduced resistance to airflow. Use of an oxyhood is not recommended because helium tends to separate as a layer at the top of the oxyhood. It usually is given through a tight-fitting face mask. The ventilator transducer is calibrated with an air-O 2 mixture, and therefore, with a HeliOx mixture, the tidal volume may not be accurate unless it is measured directly. (Kemper KJ.

To further review theories that explain the development of pulmonary edema in children with croup and epiglottitis, see the following ref- 19,20. E, E Children who develop hyaline membrane disease or have pulmonary hypoplasia owing to a wide variety of reasons including diaphragmatic hernia, children with tracheoesophageal fistula, and those who develop early neonatal infections resulting from, but not limited to, group B streptococcal infection, ureaplasma, respiratory syncytial virus, or cytomegalovirus, seem to be at a higher risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Other risk factors include male sex, white race, and a birth-weight of less than 750 g. (Kennedy KA. Semin Perinatol, 1993; 17:247.) 21.

Impaired lymphatic drainage promotes pulmonary edema. Once extra-alveolar air develops, it may dissect into the subcutaneous space and mediastinum. Further extension into the pericardium and peritoneum may occur. The primary event appears to be epithelial necrosis. 25. D Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have been shown to have a blunted arousal response to hypoxia. Increased chest wall compliance places these infants at a mechanical disadvantage, particularly during periods of decreased or low intercostal muscle activity, such as during rapid eye movement during sleep. The peripheral chemoreceptors are intact in these babies. Prolonged ventilatory support may lead to disuse atrophy of respiratory muscles. 26. E Normally, the blood flow through the right coronary artery occurs during both diastole and systole, as opposed to the blood flow through the left coronary artery, which occurs primarily during diastole. In infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, with the development of pulmonary hypertension and particularly with progressive pulmonary hypertension, the blood flow through the right coronary artery becomes limited to diastole as right ventricular pressure and volume increase. (Berman W. Pediatrics, 1982; 70:708.) lung volume. This would lead to an increase in functional residual capacity (FRC). It is decreased during active sleep because it is arousal-dependent. Specific compliance and specific conductance are the same for adults and children. (Kosch PC, Stark AR.J Appl Physiol, 1984; 57:1126 -1133 48. B Time constant = resistance \u00d7 compliance. Whenever one of the components of the time constant (i.e., either the resistance or the compliance) increases, the movement of air from one lung unit to another would be prolonged, leading to an increase in the time constant. Therefore, applying these principles in the diagram, because the resistance in the airway leading to unit A is increased, and the compliance of unit C is also increased, these two units will contain less volume of gas when inflation is interrupted prematurely. 60. B Peripheral chemoreceptors respond to a falling oxygen saturation in a linear fashion by increasing the inspired minute ventilation. There is an exponential increase in minute ventilation as PaO 2 falls, particularly at PaO 2 less than 60 torr. (Berger AJ, et al. N Engl J Med, 1977; 297:194-198.) 61. D Laryngeal and bronchial receptors respond to increasing CO 2 in a linear fashion. (Berger AJ, et al. N Engl J Med, 1977; 297:194-198.) 62. D The carbon dioxide response curve which relates alveolar CO 2 to alveolar ventilation is shifted to the left in the neonate. (Rigatto H. Apnea. Pediatr Clin North Am, 1982; 29:1105.) 63. D Preterm infants have a characteristic breathing pattern referred to as periodic breathing (i.e., pauses in respirations lasting 5-10 seconds). Owing to the higher O 2 demand, newborn infants compensate by having a higher minute ventilation and a shift in the CO 2 response curve to the left. The carotid bodies are present in preterm infants. (Rigatto H. Pediatr Clin North Am, 1982; 29:1105.) 64. D Total respiratory system compliance equals lung compliance plus chest wall compliance. With age, there is a progressive reduction in chest wall compliance which accounts for a reduction in the total respiratory system compliance. 70. B Babies who were born prematurely continue to be at high risk of apnea postoperatively (following general anesthesia) and therefore, should be monitored for 24-48 hours after anesthesia. Aminophylline will increase breathing without significantly altering the CO 2 and pH around the respiratory center. It appears to increase the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide. Patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy who undergo surgical resection may be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) because of airway obstruction from postoperative edema or sometimes owing to decreased ventilatory drive after anesthesia. The increased opioid activity found in the spinal fluid in these patients may be a contributing factor to decreased ventilatory drive noted perioperatively. ( ",

With higher negative inspiratory pressure, as seen with status asthmaticus, there is an increase in afterload during inspiration with a subsequent decrease in left ventricular output, which is followed by a sharp increase in left ventricular output during subsequent expiration. This leads to the phenomenon of pulsus paradoxus (PP). A decrease in PP may indicate an improvement in the patient's condition (i.e., a smaller fall in pleural), but it may also indicate the patient's fatigue and worsening clinical condition. Another factor that contributes to PP is ventricular interdependence, which can be exaggerated by the pulmonary hypertension, as it may be seen with severe status asthmaticus. The hypoxia that is seen during status asthmaticus results from V/Q mismatch, excessive O 2 requirement secondary to increased metabolic demand, and a degree of interstitial edema. ( The lungs emerge as a bud from the pharynx at day 26 following conception. This bud elongates, separates from the esophagus, and continues to divide to form the main bronchi. Extensive subdivision in the pseudoglandular stage leads to formation of the conducting airway, the most peripheral of which are the terminal bronchioles, which give rise to respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts during the canalicular stage. During this later stage, the acinus is formed.

Because regional differences in lung resistance and compliance often coexist, maintaining a constant tidal volume may overdistend areas of the lung that are aerated if the remainder of the lung is collapsed. Similarly, maintaining a constant inspiratory flow pattern when regional differences in lung units exist will selectively increase distention of lung units with lower resistance. (Haake R, et al. Chest, 1987; 1:608.) 174. D Pulmonary conditions associated with decreased compliance, such as pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS or increased airway resistance such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have the potential for being homogenous. This homogeneity can result in regional overdistention during positive pressure ventilation. Hyperinflation secondary to airway narrowing or collapse, such as seen with auto-PEEP, increases end-expiratory lung volume, but does not result in lung expansion of the hyperinflated lung units until airway pressure exceeds the level of auto-PEEP. Although the work of breathing during spontaneous breathing is increased by auto-PEEP, end-inspiratory lung volumes do not increase. (Bone RC, Stober G. Med Clin Noth Am, 1983; 67:599.) 175. D Changes in intrathoracic pressure correlate highly with changes in lung volume. Changes in intrathoracic pressure are independent of lung compliance. An increase in respiratory rate with lung conditions associated with increased expiratory airway resistance will result in dynamic hyperinflation, because there is inadequate time for exhalation. Examples are COPD, asthma, and other causes of intrathoracic airway obstruction. Thus, overdistention is possible with a fixed tidal breath or tidal volume. Because regional lung compliance, even in healthy individuals, is different under all conditions, uniform expansion of all lung units by positive pressure ventilation at any setting probably never occurs. ( 178. D Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt is often created in neonates and infants with an underlying cardiac defect in order to improve pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation. Examples are the (modified) Blalock-Taussig shunt that connects the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery using a synthetic material, and the aortic to pulmonary window, which usually connects the ascending aorta to the pulmonary artery. Conditions that lead to a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance would increase the flow across the shunt with an increase in left-to-right shunt. Examples include: alkalosis, vasodilators such as hydralazine and nitroprusside, an increase in the concentration of inspired oxygen, and selective pulmonary vasodilators, such as nitric oxide. Interventions that lead to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, such as increasing PEEP, would lead to a reduction in pulmonary blood flow and a reduction in the left-to-right shunt. 182. C Histological features of infants with BPD include squamous metaplasia of the airway epithelium (large and small airways), increased peribronchial smooth muscle with fibrosis, submucosal edema, and inflammation with hypertrophy of submucosal glands. In the parenchyma, there are areas of fibrosis with atelectasis alternating with areas of hyperinflation, which, on gross examination of the lungs, has a cobblestone appearance. In more long-standing cases, there is diminution in alveolarization and surface area. The decrease in the number of alveoli probably reflects the onset of the insult with subsequent failure of the ability to regenerate new alveoli. This is associated with an increased number of small pulmonary arteries, which may contribute to pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary arterial tree shows proliferation of the intima, smooth muscle hypertrophy, distal extension of smooth muscles, and adventitial thickening. 186. E Hysteresis refers to the failure of a system to follow identical paths of response during application and during withdrawal of a force. In the lungs, this is due mainly to surface properties and alveolar recruitment-derecruitment. In the chest wall, this is because of muscles and ligaments, both of which exhibit hysteresis.

The diaphragm is most efficient at the lung volume that corresponds to the FRC, and thus increasing the end-expiratory lung volume above this does not improve the efficiency of the diaphragm. Increasing the radius of curvature increases the efficiency of the diaphragm. The diaphragm of an infant has less radius of curvature than that of an adult, and is less efficient. ( In order to keep the PaO2 the same, and therefore compensate for the same degree of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient as the atmospheric pressure decreases, the alveolar oxygen tension must remain the same (i.e., 192.51). Therefore, 195. E Type I alveolar cells are less in number than type II alveolar cells (which synthesize surfactant), but they cover a much larger area of the lung. Their primary function is to reduce the barrier to gas exchange. ( 10, 11. D, D Myocardial wall tension is directly proportional to intraventricular pressure and also directly proportional to the intraventricular volume. However, myocardial wall tension is inversely proportional to the myocardial wall thickness. Therefore, in a situation where the wall of the myocardium is thin, there is an increase in myocardial wall tension, and this is likely to lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption because the majority of oxygen consumed by the heart is utilized by myocardial wall tension. A heart that is dilated (which means that there is increased intraventricular volume associated with a large preload) in the presence of a thin left ventricular wall is a heart that would be considered least efficient. ( 29. D Cyanosis in the face of a normal PaO 2 occurs with smoke inhalation, which is particularly associated with CO poisoning. An overdose on shoe dye leads to met-hemoglobinemia. Both these clinical conditions are characterized by a normal arterial oxygen tension, but a decreased measured oxygen saturation. Patients with a very high hematocrit also may present with cyanosis, which is usually a peripheral cyanosis in the presence of a normal PaO 2 . ( 33. C These findings suggest that there is increased pulmonary blood flow, which is likely to lead to pulmonary congestion, and also a diastolic overload on the right ventricle. Use of hyperventilation and tolazoline will lead to further pulmonary congestion and may lead to deterioration of the patient's overall condition. (Nichols DG, et al.

            "text": "Early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal infections are usually seen within the first week of birth. Early-onset disease is primarily a disease of premature infants less than 35 weeks gestation and weighing less than 2500 g at birth. Late-onset infection can be delayed up to 3 months after birth. There is a poor correlation between the late-onset group B streptococcal infection and maternal colonization, 95% of the isolates are type III, and there is a higher association with meningitis, as opposed to association with pneumonia that is seen with early-onset group B streptococcal infection. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1016,1017.) 11. T, F, T, T, F, T, T, T The initial antibiotic therapy of the sick neonate generally consists of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. Whereas the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin is synergistic against group B streptococcal infection, the addition of chloramphenicol to ampicillin is of no additional benefit. The immaturity of the immunological system of the newborn predisposes this group of patients to susceptibility to group B streptococcal infection. It is the deficiency in complement, antibodies, and plasma components that is thought to be responsible for the short-term outcome improvement in simple and double volume exchange transfusions. Listeria monocytogenes generally affects extremes of age and pregnant women, and it has a bimodal presentation similar to group B streptococcal infection (i.e., early-onset and late-onset). 13. D The majority of infections in which a source is identified are related to maternal genital infections. The incubation period for neonatal herpes is usually longer than 7 days. The likelihood of the neonate contracting the disease is correlated with a prolonged rupture of membranes (>6 hours) in a mother with active genital infection. ( 16. D Several attempts at classifying meningococcal disease severity and prognosis have occurred. The characteristics that are associated with a worsened outcome represent failure of the child's organ systems to adequately compensate for the disease. A low leukocyte count in the periphery or in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may represent a failure of the host's neutrophils to mount an adequate response. Similarly, the presence of shock, petechiae, and thrombocytopenia are unfavorable. The elevation of the sedimentation rate is, in part, owing to elevation of the acute phase reactants, which includes fibrinogen, and this will take at least 24 hours. A sedimentation rate of 100 mm/hour (as stated in the question) would suggest that the infection has been going on for more than several hours, and it would constitute a good prognostic feature. ( 17. D The cardiovascular collapse and instability associated with meningococcal infection was originally thought to be resulting primarily from adrenal dysfunction. However, large doses of exogenous corticosteroids were not always effective in reversing the shock state, and therefore, the more recent prevailing theory is that the cardiovascular collapse is actually secondary to endotoxemia, with its effect in inducing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Fulminant meningococcemia has an estimated mortality rate of 85%. Petechiae are frequently present in this disease and are related to a failure of the hematopoietic system and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Corticosteroids are a promising intervention that have not been demonstrated to universally reverse the shock state. ( ",

            "text": "A history of freshwater lake swimming is an important etiological risk factor for N. meningitis. Otitis media is often seen in association with H. influenzae meningitis. Meningitis in the vast majority of cases does not actually involve the parenchyma. It is limited to the three layers of the meninges. The Virchow-Robin spaces are a continuous extension of the subarachnoid space, which will allow the bacteria to gain access into the subarachnoid space, and maybe to the most superficial surface of the brain. Meningitis, when severe, is often associated with cerebral edema. 28. E By day 5 of treatment with antibiotics, 85% of children with H. influenzae meningitis will be afebrile. SIADH has been noted in more than 50% of patients with meningitis. Under these circumstances, restriction of fluid and close monitoring of fluids and electrolytes are a necessary part of the management of these patients. Subdural effusions, which are a recognized complication of meningitis, generally resolve spontaneously and do not require surgical intervention in the vast majority of cases. Nosocomial infection is a common cause of recurrent treatment after initial treatment for meningitis. 39. D Over the past 30 years, cyanotic congenital heart disease has replaced suppurative otitis media or mastoiditis and suppurative sinusitis as the most common predisposing factor for brain abscess. This is true for the industrial nation, but even in developing nations, it is the most likely predisposing factor. Overall, a predisposing factor can be determined in approximately 85% of all patients with brain abscess, and therefore, a meticulous evaluation for a predisposing factor is warranted in these patients. 41. D Normal brain parenchyma is highly resistant to invasion by microorganisms and therefore, abscess formation seems to occur only in areas of the brain with focal ischemia, necrosis, or marginal perfusion. Poor vascular supply in the white matter or at the junction of the gray and white matter makes these areas the most likely to be affected by brain abscess. With the exception of the neonatal period, abscess infrequently complicates a course of bacterial meningitis. In the neonatal period, Citrobacter diversus and Proteus mirabilis are the most common etiological agents that usually cause meningitis and are subsequently complicated by brain abscess. When seizures develop in association with brain abscess, they are most commonly a generalized seizure. In up to 30% of brain abscess cases, the microbiology is polymicrobial, which could be a combination of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Suppurative complications of otitis media or sinusitis are becoming less and less common as an etiological agent or predisposing factors for brain abscess. Because of poor penetration into the abscess cavity, aminoglycosides are not effective for treatment of brain abscess. 42. D Unlike the epidural space, the subdural space is not limited by attachment of the dura to the skull sutures, allowing extension and the spread of the subdural empyema over a wide area of the cerebral hemispheres. The potential subdural space is restricted at the base of the brain, and therefore involvement of the base of the brain is rare with subdural abscesses. In infants, subdural empyema generally complicates acute meningitis, and therefore is caused by the organisms commonly implicated in causing meningitis. Because the incidence of H. influenza type B as a cause of meningitis in infants has decreased dramatically in the United States, this organism is becoming less and less an etiological agent for subdural empyema. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic imaging procedure of choice for subdural empyema. Advantages of MRI over the computed tomography (CT) scan include the lack of bone artifact, the ability to detect the smaller extracranial fluid collection, and improved ability to differentiate extracranial collection of fluid from other differential diagnoses such as cerebritis, cerebral edema, and venous thrombosis. MRI can also detect the density difference from elevated protein concentration, and therefore distinguish a subdural abscess from other sterile collections, such as subdural effusions. 44. D Proposed and simplified diagnostic criteria for toxic shock syndrome in children include: fever equal to or greater than 39\u00b0C, lymphopenia, rash, shock, diarrhea and vomiting, and irritability. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not adopted these simplified criteria, however. Toxic shock syndrome can also be caused by streptococci, and is one example of severe group A streptococcal disease. ",

Therefore, hypotension with renal hypoperfusion may or may not produce ischemic renal injury. However, these autoregulatory mechanisms are not well developed in neonates. Neonates have high renin levels, which in turn, are associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and reduced outer cortical blood flow. The cortical glomeruli are immature and so are their corresponding tubules. This pattern of high renin and reduced outer cortical blood flow makes neonates more vulnerable to renal dysfunction as a result of hypotension of systemic pressures only slightly below the normal range. In animal studies, newborn animals have decreased production of atrial natriuretic peptide in response to saline challenge. All these factors combined make the incidence of acute renal failure in neonates, after cardiac surgery, higher than in older infants and children. (Nichols DG, et al. Critical Heart Disease in Infants and Children, Mosby 1995; pp. 125, 562.) 2. C Furosemide causes vasodilation of the cortical vasculature by direct action and through release of prostaglandins. Furosemide maintains renal blood flow and tubular blood flow when cardiac output is compromised. Mannitol is also a vasodilator of the cortical vasculature that increases renal blood flow either directly by drawing fluid from extravascular to intravascular space, thus increasing total plasma volume, or by increasing prostaglandin production. Increased plasma volume alone does not fully explain the effects of mannitol, because volume expansion with saline improves renal blood flow without improving GFR. The improvement in GFR seen with mannitol is associated with a decrease in afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance, which is probably mediated by prostaglandins. (2) third space volume loss; (3) bilateral ureteral obstruction; (4) cardiac failure; and (5) increased intra-abdominal pressure. In this patient, the latter is important to recognize (because it appears that intravascular volume has been expanded and cardiac output is normal) because prompt surgery to relieve increased intra-abdominal pressure is associated with rapid diuresis. The development of this problem is best avoided by direct measurement of intraabdominal pressure either via the esophageal route or per gastrostomy. Data indicate that the abdominal wall should not be closed if pressure exceeds 20 mmHg. In this case, it is best to employ a silo with delayed closure to allow time for the compliance of the abdominal wall to increase. ",

Caution must be exercised in correcting acidosis abruptly, as a rapid decline in the level of ionized calcium may precipitate tetany.

C It is not uncommon to have hyperglycemia in association with a head-injured child. Most likely, as a result of an increase in catecholamines and corticosteroids, there is an increase in blood sugar. Hyperglycemia has already been shown to be associated with the degree of severity in brain injury. Some data suggests that ischemic brain injury may be worse in those patients who have hyperglycemia in their recovery phase as opposed to those patients who had normoglycemia. Any coagulopathy that may exacerbate an ischemic picture also may worsen the severity of brain injury. 6. E The first step in the treatment of hypoglycemia in a child is initiation of dextrose bolus followed by an infusion of 10% dextrose. All of these conditions are characterized either by the inability to release glycogen from the liver or depletion of glycogen from the liver, and therefore, glucagon is unlikely to be effective. 7. E The stimulus for the mechanisms which elevate blood glucose in the setting of hypoglycemia is primarily CNS hypoglycemia. The body's measures which help to remedy hypoglycemia are primarily the release of epinephrine and glucagon with their effects being additive. The neonate requires a considerable amount of glucose, especially in the perioperative period. There is a significant decline in glycogen storage within the liver within the first 3 postnatal hours.

Death can occur within 1-5 days after the presentation of diabetes insipidus with cerebral insult. Low urine osmolality (<300 mOsmol/L) and serum osmolality higher than 295 mOsmol/L is consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus without the presence of any osmotic diuretics. In the absence of ADH hormone, the urine flow will continue to increase in the range of 15-20 mL/kg/hour with a significant increase in serum osmolality. 15. C The daily requirement is approximately 0.3-0.4 mEq/kg/day intravenously. With a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, magnesium replacement may precipitate hypermagnesemia. Intravenous magnesium should not be given as a rapid bolus (as discussed previously). Magnesium chloride is preferable to magnesium sulphate because the sulphate can bind calcium. Rapid magnesium infusion leads to a poor clinical response because peak magnesium levels are associated with peak renal excretion. 20. D With long-term steroid use, morning administration will minimize hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Also, with prolonged use of the administration of steroids, it is best to administer the dose in the morning, because this will coincide with peak diurnal variation in the endogenous steroid levels. The 30-minute adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration test is a reliable test for adrenal suppression. Prolonged use of 12 mg/m 2 /day of cortisol does not cause clinical significant hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis suppression. Methylprednisolone does not interfere with the common radioimmune assay method of cortisol administration. Dexamethasone administration will not interfere with subsequent measurement of cortisol, and therefore, it is used in the so-called dexamethasone suppression test. 2. D The ebb phase and the flow phase are characteristic features of hypermetabolism and not features of a starvation syndrome. The ebb phase is similar to a shock stage during which the metabolic rate is slow. The flow phase is characterized by increased metabolism. Normally with aerobic glycolysis, the end product is pyruvate. Subsequently the end products enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (kreb cycle) for production of the high-energy adenosine triphosphate. With substantial ketonemia, this process is inhibited, and therefore, utilization of glucose is impaired. 3. B During hypermetabolism, which is characterized by an initial ebb phase followed by a flow phase, there is usually an associated hyperglycemia owing to decreased sensitivity to the effect of insulin, although the level of insulin may actually be higher than usual. 6. E Preventive measures that are used for stress ulceration in the ICU include feeding, which by itself, acts as a protective barrier for the gastric mucosa, or the administration of H 2 blockers, which may be administered by continuous infusion. These would include ranitidine or famotidine. Administration of antacids has been shown to be as effective as H 2 blockers. Alternatives include administration of sucralfate, which has been shown to be comparable to H 2 blockers. Enteral feedings seem to stimulate release of the hormone gastrin. Administration of gastrin itself is not one of the measures that is clinically used in an ICU as a preventative measure against stress ulceration. (Rogers MC, et 10. D Vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone, appears to be released during laparotomy and contributes to the decreased motility of the small bowel. Other contributing factors are hypokalemia, particularly with potassium levels of less than 2.5 mEq/L. The colon is the portion of the bowel most dependent on neural control to achieve motility. This is the portion of the bowel that is most sensitive to anesthesia-induced inhibition of motility, and the last to recover. The role that handling or direct manipulation of the gut plays in the development of ileus is not very clear. 12. D Postoperative intussusception that is usually ileoileal rather than ileocecal (which is seen in late infancy) is a problem that can be overlooked in the postoperative patient, particularly in patients who are receiving analgesia for postoperative care along with nasogastric suctioning to decompress the bowel.

(Viscidi RP. Pediatrics, 1981; 67:381.) 17. C Acute pancreatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas with subsequent release of the enzymes amylase and lipase. The degree of serum amylase does not seem to be proportional to the severity of acute pancreatitis. Serum lipase levels seem to be elevated for a longer period of time than serum amylase. Pancreatic trypsinogen serum levels seem to rise early in the course of pancreatitis and remain elevated for up to 5 days. In a clinical situation where amylase and lipase are normal and there is a high suspicion of pancreatitis, one could look at the level of trypsinogen. Some of the bad prognostic signs of acute pancreatitis include hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and azotemia. 27. C Hepatorenal syndrome can develop in a setting of isovolemia. However, preventive measures that have been shown to be helpful for this clinical condition include avoiding large volume paracentesis in order to avoid intravascular volume depletion, as well as use of potent diuretics, which can also lead to intravascular volume depletion. Use of dopamine has not been shown to be effective for this clinical condition. In the early stages when this condition is suspected, expansion of intravascular volume with salt-poor albumin to raise the central venous pressure to the upper limits of normal is a helpful preventive measure. Other preventive measures include avoidance of prostaglandin antagonists, such as ibuprofen. 29. E Measures to decrease protein intake, as well as elimination of colonic bacteria by use of oral lactulose, oral antibiotics, such as neomycin, have been shown to be effective for HE. Use of hypertonic glucose to provide calories is also an important measure in the management of these patients. (Butterworth RF. Dig Dis Sci, 1992; 37: 321-327.) 30, 31. D, E In a patient with HE, there is inappropriate pathological cerebrovascular tone along with altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier that contributes to their symptomatology. In these patients, intracranial pressure monitoring along with hyperventilation to lower the PCO 2 will facilitate management. Steroids have not been shown to decrease mortality in these settings. These patients should be considered for hepatic transplantation and evaluated for this procedure in the initial stages of ICU admission because it has been shown that if the patient progresses to decorticate posturing and becomes ventilator dependent, it usually too late to initiate liver transplantation.

It seems that the process of glucuronidation is more resistant to abnormalities in function than the process of oxidation, and therefore, in treating a patient with liver disease, preference should be given to drugs that are metabolized through this pathway. For drugs that undergo significant hepatic biotransformation clearance of these drugs tends to be proportional to the degree of liver blood flow. 38. C Medium-chain triglycerides (C 6 to C 12 ) inhibit gastric emptying less than long-chain fatty acids, and are absorbed from the GI tract faster than long-chain fatty acids. Consequently, they convert into energy more rapidly than the long-chain fatty acids, or long-chain triglycerides. Medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed directly into the systemic circulation through the portal venous system, instead of being absorbed through the lymphatic lacteals and subsequently into the thoracic duct. ( 1. E The developmental pattern of immunoglobulins (Igs) is as follows: IgG transfer across the placenta occurs as early as 8 weeks gestational age. Its level is directly proportional to gestational age, but is still less than 50% of term levels at 28 weeks gestation. The IgG levels fall during the first four months of extrauterine life reaching adult levels by 4-6 years of age. By the 10th week of gestation, the fetus is capable of producing IgM and may make large quantities in the presence of a congenital infection. IgA is not measurable until late in gestational life and is very limited in the infant, failing to reach adult values until puberty. ",

B, A, D, C Diabetic ketoacidosis or any acute metabolic acidosis state will decrease PCO 2 by 1-1.5 mmHg for each millimole change in bicarbonate concentration. In severe scoliosis, there is retraction of the chest wall causing chronic alveolar hypoventilation, with the development of chronic respiratory acidosis. A bicarbonate rise of 4 mmol will occur with a rise in 10 mmHg of PCO 2 . Here both pH and bicarbonate concentrations are higher than expected for the level of PCO 2 elevation suggesting a mixed acid base disorder-metabolic acidosis superimposed or chronic respiratory acidosis. Botulism will cause rapid onset of respiratory failure causing pure respiratory acidosis. In acute respiratory acidosis, the pH will fall by approximately 0.08 U for each 10 mmHg of PCO 2 . Plasma bicarbonate will increase 1 mmol/L for each increase of 10 mmHg in PCO 2 . Salicylate intoxication causes acute metabolic acidosis. It also stimulates the respiratory center causing coincident respiratory alkalosis.

C Nearly all critically-ill patients have decreased serum levels of T3 and 50% have a decrease in the level of T4 concentration with normal or low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The reduction in T3 levels results from a decrease in deiodinase activity that occurs in critical illness. This is reflected in the increase in serum level of T3 that occurs during critical illness. This enzyme is responsible for the degradation reverse of T3, explaining the increase in serum levels of reverse T3 that occurs in critical illness. 2.

E The local anesthetics are of two types, amides and esters, which are both weak bases that block nerve conduction at the sodium channel when they are in their ionized form. In order to gain access to the channel, the drug must cross the membrane. It does this in its ionized form. The minimum concentration of a local anesthetic is the concentration necessary to block nerve impulse conduction. Unmyelinated nerve fibers carry nociceptive information and have a lower minimum concentration than heavily myelinated fibers. Less local anesthetic is necessary to block the transmission of pain than is necessary to produce muscle paralysis. ( 16. E GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem. The GABA receptor has two \u03b1 and two \u03b2 subunits. Binding of benzodiazepines to the \u03b1 subunits of the GABA receptor facilitates binding to the \u03b2-receptors and promotes membrane hyperpolarization and resistance to neuronal excitation. The benzodiazepines can blunt or abolish the respiratory responses to hypercarbia and hypoxia. They produce hypoventilation by reducing tidal volume. The benzodiazepines produce minimal cardiac affects. However, they do reduce preload and afterload. They increase, rather than decrease coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption. 3. C First one has to calculate the creatinine clearance, which is = L \u00d7 K / serum creatinine, where L is length of the child, K is a constant and it equals .45 for this age. Therefore, the creatinine clearance for this patient = 75 \u00d7 0.45 / 1.2. Assuming that the normal creatinine clearance is 100 mL/minute/1.73 M 2 , the renal index would = 28.1 mL/minute, which is equal to 0. 4. E Patients at risk of adrenal hypofunction who are admitted to the PICU (for nontrivial illness) require additional doses of corticosteroid coverage. The physiological dose is 12.5 mg/M 2 body surface area (BSA)/day of hydrocortisone. Patients with a febrile illness presumed to be secondary to a nontrivial infection, deserve doubling of the maintenance dose. Patients with a major trauma, major surgery, or generalized sepsis deserve 3-4 times the maintenance dose. When time allows, high-dose corticosteroids must be initiated 1-2 days prior to surgery, and weaned over a period of 5-7 days. Because the risk of undertreatment is higher than overtreatment in patients with a serious illness or trauma, it is reasonable for a clinician to administer 100-200 mg/M 2 BSA/day of hydrocortisone to these patients.

Phenoxybenzamine, or \u03b1 1 blocking agent, is the most selective \u03b1 1 blocking agent, and is used for preoperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma. Prazosin is a potent but less selective \u03b1 blocker, and its blockade of \u03b1 2 receptors (presynaptic receptors) cause uninhibited release of norepinephrine, thus counterbalancing the \u03b1 1 receptor blockade.

It is metabolized in the liver by esterases. It is metabolized by plasma pseudocholinesterase and nonenzymatic hydrolysis. The two major cocaine metabolites in urine are benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. Most urine drug screening tests detect benzoylecgonine. There is a greater potential for toxicity in patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency because cocaine will be less metabolized. Drug abusers ingest an organophosphate in an attempt to prolong the effects of cocaine, which also increases the risk of cocaine toxicity. (Goldfrank LR.

These are referred to as amphetamines, although a more precise name, phenylethylamines, exists. The diagnosis of amphetamine overdose depends on a high degree of suspicion along with clinical judgment. Diagnosis by history alone is rarely helpful. There is no reliable blood analysis test and the quantitative urine test is not particularly useful for acute settings. One of the major differentiating features between cocaine and amphetamines is the duration of action, which lasts for about 2 hours in the case of cocaine. The half-life of amphetamines on the other hand ranges from 8 to 30 hours. Amphetamines enhance the release of, and block the reuptake of, catecholamines, resulting in excess stimulation of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptors. At higher doses, they can cause release of serotonin. The clinical manifestations are that of cardiovascular and CNS excitation. Do not neglect to obtain a rectal temperature in these patients. Hyperthermia, if not recognized and treated aggressively, may be rapidly fatal in association with delirium. These patients are often very agitated and require sedation because agitation against restraints may exacerbate the associated rhabdomyolysis.

This alternative pathway is option E (salicylate excretion unchanged in urine), and therefore, this route of elimination becomes of paramount importance during salicylate intoxication. Because two of the major pathways become saturated, the half-life increases from 2 to 4 hours at therapeutic doses to as long as 20 hours.

Second-degree burns involve a tissue depth into the dermis. A superficial partial-thickness burn is moist, red, and tender. It becomes pale, but dermal papillae can be visualized through the eschar within a few days. Third-degree burns extend through all layers of the skin and invade the hypodermic fat. 17. B With the Rule of 9's, the front and back are each assigned 18% of BSA; each arm is assigned 9%; each leg is assigned 18%. Therefore, a burn that involves 9% (arm), plus 18% (leg), plus 18% (back), equals 45% total BSA burn. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; p. 1526.)",

A moderate sized burn involves between 5 and 15% of the body surface area. Alternatively, any full-thickness component also qualifies. Involvement of the hands, face, feet, perineum, or the presence of a complicating factor, such as chemical or electrical injury, also constitutes a moderate burn. A severe burn is characterized by more than 15% total BSA burn or the presence of smoke inhalation or CO poisoning. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; p. 1526, figure 45.2.) 19. B House fires account for 84% of burn associated fatalities, the cause of which is most frequently smoke inhalation rather than tissue damage from flames. Chemical burns should be flushed with water for 20-30 minutes, not alcohol. Tetanus prophylaxis must be addressed in all burn patients. Scald burns are the most common type of pediatric burn and the home is the most common location. ( 20. E The criteria for transfer to a burn center include significant underlying disease, associated inhalation injury, 10% BSA or more of partial or thirddegree burns in children younger than 10 years of age or more than 20% BSA in children older than 10 years of age, third-degree burns more than 5% in any age group, electrical and chemical burns, and burns associated with major trauma.

Silver sulfadiazine is a broad antibacterial agent that is painless. It penetrates fairly well through the eschar. It is contraindicated in pregnancy and has unknown absorptive properties in the fetus. Bacitracin is limited in its antibacterial action, has poor eschar penetration, but is easy to apply and cosmetically acceptable. 24. T, T, F, F, T Resistance to silver sulfadiazine is common for Enterobacter cloacae, S. aureus, and occasionally P. aeruginosa. All three of these organisms are usually sensitive to Mafenide. Silver nitrate can induce methemoglobinemia. Ideally surgical excision and closure of the wound should take place as soon as the child is stable enough for anesthesia. More than 105 organisms per gram of tissue constitute burn wound sepsis. Early surgical closure decreases significant blood loss. 26. E Thermal injury from smoke inhalation is usually limited to the supra-glottic airway. Inhalation injury accounts for more than 50% of the mortality associated with major burns. Carbon monoxide poisoning accounts for approximately 50% of the poisonings in the United States per year. The largest source of CO is generated from the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing compounds. 27. D The oxy-Hb dissociation curve is shifted to the left in CO poisoning, thereby enhancing oxygen affinity for Hb and impeding oxygen delivery from blood to tissue. The toxic effects of CO result from its direct action on the cytochrome-oxidase system and not solely on the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. If a significant amount of time has passed since the exposure of CO poisoning, an abnormal level may not be discovered. ( 28. D The heart rate and coronary blood flow increase in response to CO. Pulmonary edema occurs in about 10-30% of cases, however, the mechanism for pulmonary edema remains speculative. Cerebral blood flow and edema also increase. The cherry-red skin color is not commonly seen clinically. ( 29. T, F, F, T, T, T, T, T Muscle necrosis leads to myoglobinuria and subsequent acute renal failure. Salivary amylase is responsible for development of hyperamylasemia. A mild acidosis actually shifts the oxy-Hb dissociation curve to the right, increasing release of oxygen to the tissues and so should not be treated. The half-life of CO is 5-6 hours in room air, 1.5 hours in 100% FiO2, and less than 30 minutes in 100% FiO2 in 2.5 atmospheres. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment should be instituted when a patient has a CO Hb of more than 25%, signs and symptoms of CO poisoning, and a hyperbaric oxygen facility available. 32. D At low voltages, alternating current is more dangerous than direct current because of its ability to freeze the extremity to the electrical source. Joule's law states that power equals amperage squared times resistance (P = I 2 R). Surface burns result from the ignition of clothing or from the heat of the current traveling close to the skin. Arc burns are produced by a current that travels external to the body, as an electric arc forms between two objects of opposite charges. ",

This is sometimes referred to as an incomplete or partial crossmatch. The immediate phase crossmatch eliminates serious hemolytic reactions because of errors in the ABO typing. It will fail to detect only a few unexpected antibodies outside of the ABO system, most of which are clinically insignificant. If time does not permit even a preliminary screen, ABO and Rh type-specific, uncrossmatched blood is still preferable (and more abundant). Of patients never exposed to blood, fewer than 1 in 1000 will have an unexpected antibody detected in the immediate phase crossmatch. 36. E FFP provides the equivalent clotting factors of a single unit of fresh whole blood. The administration of FFP should be considered when 200% of the calculated circulating blood volume has been replaced with crystalloids and red cell concentrates. A precipitous fall in platelet count may not be tolerated, as well as a slow decline in thrombocytopenic patients. Platelet administration begins when 100-150% of the calculated circulating blood volume has been replaced with crystalloid and red cell concentrates. The dilutional coagulopathy is rapidly corrected once perfusion is restored, but may be exacerbated by the development or persistence of hypotension. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; p. 1483.) 37. C Bleeding and edema within an intact fascial compartment can lead to the development of increased pressure, muscle ischemia, and death. Whereas pulses may be intact distally with a compartment syndrome, one constant finding is severe pain even with passive motion. Muscle compartment pressures can be evaluated during the secondary survey of the trauma patient using an 18-gage needle and water manometer. Compartment pressures of 40 cm H 2 O should cause concern, whereas pressures greater than 60 cm H 2 O require fasciotomy. 39. D Almost all deaths from thoracic injury in children occur after the victim reaches the resuscitation center, and most children can be treated successfully with prompt diagnosis and aggressive early management. Penetrating injuries to the chest are unusual in children and usually result from fractured ribs rather than from external missiles. The mediastinum of the child is more mobile and this contributes to a low incidence of major vessel and airway injury. However, serious intrathoracic injury may be present in the absence of obvious chest wall injury. ( 41. D Flail chest injuries are rarely seen in children because high-velocity direct-chest trauma is uncommon. Additionally, rib fractures are less common in children than adults because children have very pliable ribs that are resistant to fracture. Contusions and/or penetrating injury of the lung parenchyma are frequently involved. The initial therapy should include humidified oxygen and a limitation of crystalloid resuscitation, if the remainder of the injuries permit, so that there will be a decrease in extravasation of fluid into the injured pulmonary parenchyma and a limitation of the secondary acute pulmonary edema. Definitive treatment of the flail chest takes place in the PICU by con- ",

D Therapeutic hypothermia has not been shown to improve outcome. A body temperature of less than 32\u00b0C causes the cessation of shivering.

The data regarding the use of dexamethasone in meningitis are controversial. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1061,1062.) 31. T, T, F, F, T The CSF cytology in tuberculous meningitis mimics the lymphocyte predominance found in viral meningitis. CSF glucose is classically reduced and the protein level is elevated. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1050-1061.) 32. E Aseptic meningitis is an inflammatory process of the meninges that results from a number of different etiologies. An elevated protein, a pleocytosis, and the absence of organisms on Gram stain and culture characterize it. The etiologies associated with this diagnosis are rather large and include viral, bacterial, and fungal causes. Admission of the patient to the hospital depends on the certainty of the diagnosis. To the extent that the patient is stable and the likelihood of a partially treated bacterial etiology is ruled out, outpatient management may be acceptable. (Mandell ML, et al. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 3rd Edition; pp. 1367-1379.) 33. E Enteroviral infections are higher in lower socioeconomic groups, have a 3-to 5-day incubation, and are typically seen in the latter part of the summer. The meningitis associated with these infections usually has a benign course. (American Academy of Pediatrics. In: Pickering LK, ed. 2000 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 25th Ed. Elk Grove Village, IL.) 34. T, F Please see Mandell ML, et al. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 3rd Edition; pp. 1367-1379. 35. E With HSV infection, particularly with meningoencephalitis, the electroencephalogram displays abnormalities typically in the frontal and temporal lobe area of the brain. All of the other responses are true (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1064-1066.) 36. D Arboviruses are arthropod-born viruses that are a common cause of encephalitis. These infections are usually seen in late summer and spring, and they are transmitted by arthropods. St. Louis encephalitis is the most common arbovirus infection in the United States, and is generally a mild disease. The highest mortality usually occurs with Eastern equine encephalitis. California encephalitis is usually a mild disease. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1062-1064.) 37. B, A, C, D The St. Louis encephalitis virus is distributed throughout most of the US and causes major epidemics that peak later than other arboviruses. Most infections are asymptomatic, and less than 1% have overt neurological disease. Western equine encephalitis is the usual cause of arbovirus encephalitis and California encephalitis viruses occur in the central and eastern United States, and cause diseases with a fulminant and mild course, respectively. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1063-1065.) 38. B Interestingly, in spite of the name, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever occurs primarily in the eastern United States, including the Ohio Valley area. The disease is a tick-born illness. See Question 47.

D Brain abscesses formed by hematogenous seeding tend to develop at the junction of gray and white matter and usually in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery; hence, the predominant location in the temporal and parietal lobes.

D Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is caused by a coagulase positive staphylococcus that liberates an exoprotein known as TSST-1. The host does not form neutralizing antibodies to the toxin for at least 2 years after infection. This, in addition to the noninvasiveness of the organism, may help to explain the recurrent nature of disease, especially in menstrual cases. Menstrual cases are seen exclusively in the white Caucasian population. Patients who present with elevated serum creatinine, particularly when the serum creatinine is greater than 3 mg/dL tend to have a prolonged hospital course. (Rogers MC, et al.

E Legionnaire's disease was first recognized in 1976 after an outbreak of pneumonia in Philadelphia. The organism, L. pneumophila, accounts for only about 15% of pneumonia in adults, but it causes acute pulmonary disease, mostly among adult males. The disease has also been noted in infants and children and the prevalence of elevated titers in children is quite high in some communities. The presenting complaints are usually fever, nonproductive cough, encephalopathy, and seizures; cerebellar signs may be markedly severe in these patients. The lung disease is usually lobar in nature; hepatic and renal abnormalities are often also noted.(Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1109-1110.) 49. D Super antigens are antigens that are derived from either bacteria or viruses that interact with the major histocompatibility class II proteins and activate T-cells by binding to the variable region of the \u03b2 chain of the T-cell receptor. Stimulation of the T-cell receptors leads to polyclonal T-cell activation, which results in release of massive amounts of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6. These cytokines are most likely the elements responsible for the shock and multiorgan dysfunction seen in these diseases. Super antigens differ from conventional antigens mainly in the manner in which they are processed and presented to the T-cell receptors. The polyclonal activation gener-ally results in a reduction of the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes; however, this reduction is usually reversible and transient. Super antigens are potentially involved in all the three disorders mentioned in the question. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; p. 1103.) 50. B, A Some differences have been noted between children and adults with toxic shock syndrome. Whereas only a small percentage of adults have had a prominent prodromal illness, nearly all children have between 1 and 6 days of symptoms preceding the illness. These symptoms include fever, mucosal hyperemia, erythroderma, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and myalgias. The vast majority of adults admitted to the hospital have hypotension at presentation. This finding is not prominent in children at the time of admission, although it may develop later during the hospitalization. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1103-1106.) 51. D, A, B, C Brain abscesses are the most frequently encountered form of localized intracranial infection in children. Death usually occurs with rupture of the abscess and spread of the infection into the ventricular system or herniation secondary to mass effect. Citrobacter and Proteus are the most common etiological agents in the newborn period. In patients with congenital heart disease, \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci are common. Patients who have traumatic injuries are affected by S. aureus. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for Nocardia brain abscesses. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1071-1076.) 1. A Trauma is the leading cause of death in the 1-to 15-year-old population. Neoplastic disease is second. The other responses are true. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1433-1434.) 2. D Infection is higher in patients with central lines than those without. Recent retrospective data suggests that there are no differences in infection rates between subcutaneously implanted versus externalized catheters. (Rogers, MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1438.) 3. E Fifty-five to seventy percent of febrile episodes in oncology patients are of infectious origin. Blood cultures are positive in less than 50% of cases of serious disseminated fungal infections. C. albicans and Aspergillus species are the most common fungal organisms. Neutropenia is closely correlated with morbidity and mortality. Pneumocystis is unlikely in this clinical scenario; however, pneumocystis is responsible for up to 50% of nonbacterial pneumonitis in oncology patients. Chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral infiltrates radiating from the hilum. (Rogers, MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1438-1445; table 42.6.) CHAPTER 5: HEMATOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY 4. D The half-life of transfused platelets is 7 days; with significant alloimmunization, it can be hours. All of the other statements are correct. (Rogers, MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1442,1443.) 5. D, E, C, B, F, A Chemotherapy may promote the development of a coagulopathy associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis. Actinomycin D and other antibiotics decrease the vitamin Kdependent clotting factors. Anthracycline increases fibrinolysis. L-Asparaginase may cause hypofibrinogenemia. Methotrexate can cause an antithrombin III deficiency. Vincristine may cause chronic hepatic dysfunction. Glucocorticoids increase the levels of factors II, VII, VIII, and X. (Rogers, MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1442-1457.) 6. A Primary pulmonary parenchymal involvement with leukemia is very rare. Parenchymal involvement is occasionally seen with histiocytosis X and metastatic disease (e.g., osteogenic and Ewings sarcoma, and Wilms tumor). All other statements are correct. (Rogers, MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1445-1447, table 42.8.) 7. T, T, F, T, T, F A variety of chemotherapeutics, as well as radiotherapy, can cause cardiomyopathy. Effects appear to be dose related. Radiotherapy may cause pericarditis with a chronic effusion. Histologically, interstitial fibrosis with vascular narrowing is seen. (Rogers, MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1447-1448.) The onset of Pneumocystis carinii infection typically occurs 3-6 months after bone marrow transplantation. Bacterial or fungal infection can occur within the first 2 weeks. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs 6-12 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. (Rogers, MC, et al.

All agents act by disrupting some aspect of normal cell growth or division. Antimetabolites interact with various cell enzymes (e.g., methotrexate inhibits the activity of dihydrofolate reductase). Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid, inhibits microtubule function within the cell. This prevents the formation of the spindle apparatus during metaphase, thus inhibiting cell division. The anthracycline (daunorubicin and doxorubicin) and actinomycin D inhibit the synthesis of DNA in tumor cells. Alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide cause breaks in the DNA strands. The glucocorticoids are directly lymphocytotoxic to lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma cells. (Rogers, MC, et al.

High normal intravascular volume is precisely what is desirable in the postoperative period in order to avoid the risk of thrombosis in the graft. Preoperative transfusion (with consequent hypervolemia) would increase the risk of congestive cardiac failure in the postoperative period. For cadaveric kidney transplantation, there is a positive correlation between the number of transfusions and the graft survival; the survival seems to be optimal with a transfusion from five or more different donors.

An increased risk is present for children less than 5 years of age who have a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus complicated by a prolonged untreated case of diabetic ketoacidosis.

In the absence of osmotic diuretics, when the plasma osmolality is more than 295 mOsmol/L, while the urine osmolality remains 300 mOsmol/L or less, the diagnosis of diabetes insipitus is very likely.

Levels of total serum calcium more than 15 mg% may be life-threatening. Digitalis toxicity increases in the setting of hypercalcemia. Mithramycin should be avoided if surgery is anticipated because of the possibility of severe marrow suppression as a result of its administration, and therefore, complicating thrombocytopenia which could lead to significant bleeding.

D Intravenous fat emulsions may not be tolerated well in patients with significant hepatic disease because it may not be metabolized by these patients.

D, C, E The initial intervention for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is gastric lavage and supportive measures which would include correction of any coagulopathy and use of volume expanders, either crystalloids or colloids. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable owing to upper GI hemorrhage, adequate volume expansion is crucial and this should not be withheld, even in patients who have evidence of edema. If the patient does not respond to initial intervention, an endoscopy should be performed, and if any localized area of bleeding is identified, this can be treated through endoscopy with electrical or laser cautery, or with the application of topical coagulants as indicated.

A Although the majority of infections in the post-surgical patient are nosocomial, the most likely offending organisms are aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Acinetobacter). Controversy exists over the use of prophylactic antibiotics; however, prophylactic antibiotics are most beneficial in injuries involving the large and the small bowel, and in soft tissue crush and extremity avulsion injuries.

E In the management of burn victims, feeding by the enteral route is preferable to parenteral nutrition, because food in the gut can decrease the rate of organism and toxin translocation across the GI tract. Burns lead to a reduction in Ig levels, chemotaxis, and Thelper lymphocytes. Colonization of the burn wound in 5-7 days postinjury is predominantly with Gram-positive bacteria. Arginine influences postburn recovery by stimulating wound-healing, potentially through its roles in the formation of nitric oxide, by enhancing growth hormone secretion from the pituitary gland and by directly modulating immune function. However, high concentrations of dietary lipids, especially of the \u03c9-6 series, may contribute to the development of postburn sepsis by augmenting the plasma concentration of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin.

Hydrophilic agents, such as morphine, have a greater latency and duration of action than the more lipid soluble agent fentanyl. However, the lipid soluble agents produce more segmental analgesia associated with less rostral spread than the less lipid soluble agonists.

The exhalation valve is usually kept close to the airway opening in order to minimize the circuit volume.(Rogers MC. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 2nd Edition; pp. 147-150.) 91-93. A, B, D In clinical medicine, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is probably the most common application of hyperbaric O 2 therapy. The half-life of CO is actually decreased to 23 minutes at 3.0 atmospheric pressure, as opposed to 180 minutes with 100% oxygen at the normal atmospheric pressure. Sixty to 90 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen at 2 to 2.5 atmospheric pressure seems to be safe, without significant central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, although other side effects mentioned in the question are possible.

E With turbulent airflow, the resistance to airflow is proportionate to density (as opposed to viscosity with laminar flow). Because helium is not as dense as nitrogen, it has a beneficial role in patients with upper airway obstruction, such as croup. More recently, the HeliOx mixture has also been shown to improve gas exchange in patients with acute asthma with or without ventilatory support. HeliOx mixture minimizes work of breathing by altering the resistance to airflow. HeliOx mixture is most beneficial at 80:20 or 70:30 ratios.(Rogers MC, et al.

(Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 297-300.) 104. D Please see Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 184. 105. E All of these factors are operative when it comes to the adverse hemodynamic effects of PEEP. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 2nd Edition; pp. 186.) 106. E Unless they progress to a tension pneumothorax or a tension pneumoperitoneum, none of the manifestations of barotrauma mentioned are usually clinically significant (i.e., do not require immediate intervention). (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 2nd Edition; pp. 186-188.) 107. B During tension pneumothorax, the intrapleural pressure is consistently higher than the atmospheric pressure. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 307-309.) 108. B Veno-venous extracorporeal life support (ECLS) usually requires a higher rate of flow because of the recirculation of the previously oxygenated blood. This is true when the pulmonary bed is totally non-functional. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 317,318.) 109. B, A, A veno-venous ECLS maintains pulmonary blood flow with oxygenated blood, but it does not assist the systemic circulation. On the other hand, veno-arterial ECLS) does assist the systemic circulation and it also tends to decrease the pulmonary artery pressure. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 317,318.) 110. C The oxygen saturation that is obtained using pulse oximetry is called a functional saturation, and the pulse oximetry obtains the ratio of oxy-Hb divided by the total Hb. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 333-336.) 111. C Methylene blue absorbs light maximally at 668 nm. The pulse oximeter interprets this extra absorbance as reduced Hb, and therefore a lower oxygen saturation is obtained. The oxygen saturation obtained by the pulse oximetry could drop dramatically within 30 seconds of an intravenous administration of methylene blue, and it remains reduced for approximately 2 minutes. (Scheller M. Anesthesiology, 1986; 65:550.) 112. A Carboxy-Hb and met-Hb produce these findings. (Barker SJ. Anesthesiology, 1987; 66:677.)",

E Bronchopleural fistulae (BPF) can result from blunt trauma, barotraumas, or inflammatory diseases of the lung. Patients with BPF can present acutely because of pulmonary flooding or tension pneumothorax, or subacutely with an insidious clinical course. A persistent air leak without evidence of technical problem in the pleural drainage apparatus also indicates a BPF. Several techniques can be employed using bronchoscopy to localize the proximal endobronchial site of the fistulous tract. Occasionally, air bubbles can be seen emanating from the segmental bronchus. Washing the suspected segment with saline and coughing may accentuate the bubbling. Techniques for obliteration of the fistula bronchoscopically have also been described.(McManigle JE, et al. Chest, 1990; 97:1235-1238.) 163. C After a delay of 2-8 minutes, intramuscular ketamine (4-8 mg/kg) produces anesthesia for 20-40 minutes.

D The cellular proliferative phase, after alveolar injury, is characterized by type II cellular hyperplasia, which appears to be a reparative process. These cuboidal cells may virtually cover the entire alveolar surface. They will later transform into the thin, type I alveolar epithelial cells.(Royall JA, Matalon S. In: Fuhrman BP, Zimmerman JJ. Pediatric Critical Care, Mosby Yearbook 1992, pp. 445-456.) 165. A Tachypnea is the earliest sign of respiratory muscle fatigue. As a compensation for the decrease in efficient tidal volume, the respiratory rate increases in an attempt to maintain minute ventilation. (Nunn JF. Applied Respiratory Physiology, 3rd Edition. Boston: Butterworth, 1987, p. 109.)166. C CO 2 binds with deoxy-Hb to form carbamino-Hb, which is one of the forms in which CO 2 is transported in the blood. However, only 10% of CO 2 in blood is transported in this form. Myoglobin approaches full saturation at a PO 2 of 15-30 mmHg, which is the level pertaining to voluntary muscle. The bulk of its oxygen may be released only at very low O 2 tension. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate decreases the affinity of O 2 for Hb, and thus, facilitates release of O 2 to tissues and so does carbon dioxide. This latter phenomenon is also known as the Bohr effect.O 2 binds to one of the six coordination bonds of the iron atom. Hydrogen binds to the imidazole ring of histidine on the globin chains of the Hb molecule. (Nunn JF. Applied Respiratory Physiology, 4th Edition; pp. 273-275; Guyton AC.

It occurs in 10% of adolescents and adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Massive hemoptysis usually occurs from the bronchial circulation resulting from the higher systemic pressure compared with the pulmonary circulation. Often an untreated exacerbation of the disease is a triggering factor, but sometimes there is no clear cause. If hemoptysis persists, bronchial artery embolization is warranted; this requires bronchial arteriography. (Sweeney N, Fellows K. Chest, 1990; 97:1322-1326.) 190. B In infants, the continuous muscle tone of the thorax is important to maintain FRC, because the chest wall is very compliant and lacks the rigidity necessary to oppose the elastic recoil of the lung, which tends to lower FRC. With age, as chest wall compliance decreases and the chest wall becomes more rigid and capable to oppose the elastic recoil of the lungs, FRC increases. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 2nd Edition; pp. 112-128.) 191. B A HeliOx mixture is less dense that a nitrogen-O 2 (air) mixture.

Data obtained from a specific patient can be compared with those from subjects who have the same height, weight, and age. FVC is highly reproducible and has a narrow range of normal values. It is affected in both obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. FVC may decline in the supine position by up to 20% in normal subjects and up to 38% in patients with underlying neuromuscular diseases. (Civeta JM, et al.

Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 2nd Edition; pp. 129,130.)Thus half-life is affected not only by elimination, but also by Vd. For instance, during ECLS, most of the increase in the half-life is owing to an increase in the Vd, rather than a change in drug clearance. A drug's half-life can also be used to determine the time it takes for the drug to reach a steady-state concentration, a state in which the amount of drug administered equals the amount cleared by the body.

E In pediatric and newborn services, lower respiratory infections are the most common type of nosocomial infection followed by bacteremia, urinary tract, cutaneous, and surgical wound infection. Staphylococcus aureus predominates as the most common cause of lower respiratory infections in newborns, not Klebsiella. Klebsiella is the most common organism isolated from pediatric lower respiratory tract nosocomial infections. Other common lower respiratory pathogens include Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Coagulase-negative staph, and Escherichia coli. E. coli is the most common cause of pediatric, nosocomial, urinary tract infections. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 976, 997, table 30.2.) 2. A Pneumococcus and Branhamella are the most common organisms causing sinusitis in the general pediatric population younger than 10 years of age. In intensive care patients with a nasotracheal tube in place, a variety of Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Proteus, E. coli, Enterobacter, and Serratia are found. Often, these infections are polymicrobial. Direct aspiration and culture of the material should direct therapy. Ocular infections are often caused by P. aeruginosa and may progress if left untreated. Infection from environmental contaminants also occurs. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 987,988.) 3. E Gram-negative organisms, not anerobes, are the dominant organisms that colonize the trachea in patients who are intubated. Colonization is increased in those patients receiving cimetidine or antacids. Respiratory equipment, including nebulizers, medications, and hand ventilators may also become contaminated and contribute to respiratory infections. Uncuffed endotracheal tubes contribute to the aspiration of oral secretions. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 989.) 4. C Local inflammation does not correlate with the duration of arterial catheter insertion and is not predictive of catheter tip colonization. All other responses are true. Catheters placed by surgical cutdown have twice the incidence of infection and nine-fold increase in septicemia. Disposable transducers used for 4 days had no higher risk of infection than those used for 2 days. At 8 days, the prevalence of contamination was significantly higher for the transducers (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 981,982.)

D Even in the absence of an index case within the day care setting, children who attend day care centers are at higher risk of developing meningitis. Convulsions occurring within the first 24-72 hours of meningitis may represent febrile seizures, and therefore have a better prognosis. Convulsions that develop beyond this period carry a less favorable prognosis. Limitation of ocular movement may be owing to abnormalities in the 3rd cranial nerves, and does not always indicate increased intracranial pressure. When papilledema is noted on the first day of admission of meningitis, other etiologies should be sought, particularly an intracranial mass lesion, such as a brain abscess. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1047-1060.) 23. D Limitation of ocular movements may result from irritation of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI. Convulsions do occur in at least 30% of meningitis cases. Those convulsions that are limited to the first 24-72 hours carry a better prognosis. See response to question 22. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1047-1049.) 24. E Bacterial culture of the CSF is considered the gold standard. The presence of any neutrophils in the CSF in the newborn period should be treated with a high degree of suspicion. This may be one of the early manifestations of meningitis. However, in newborn infants polymorphonuclear leukocytes may comprise up to 60% of the total CSF white cell population and still be considered normal. The opening pressure in the neonate is between 90 and 110 mmH 2 O, whereas in the older child and adult it may be as high as 180 mm H 2 O. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1049-1051, table 32.4.) 25. T, F, F Spinal fluid remains clear with up to 500 white blood cells/mm 3 . Erythrocytes raise the CSF protein concentration by about 15 mg/dL for every 1000 red blodd cells/mm 3 . A CSF lactate level of more than 14 mg% is considered abnormal. (Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1049-1047.)26. D Children who are diagnosed and admitted to the hospital for meningitis have commonly received some form of antibiotic, usually oral, prior to presentation. This form of antibiotic usually is not sufficient to treat meningitis, and therefore, it does not improve the outcome in these patients. Several hours after the administration of an appropriate antibiotic, it is certainly possible to inhibit bacterial growth in the spinal fluid.(Rogers MC, et al. Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, 3rd Edition; pp. 1051,1052.) 27. A Tuberculous meningitis, which is usually a basal form of meningitis, is more likely to present with focal neurological signs and papilledema, particularly cranial nerve palsies such as cranial nerves VII, VIII and IX. Cryptococcal meningitis may present only with behavioral changes, or it may present with symptoms of a space-occupying lesion. The opening pressure in neonates may be as high as 110 mmH 2 O.

Severe thrombocytopenia occurs less frequently. The more severe form is associated with thrombotic complications. All of the other statements are correct. (Gilman, AG, et al. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th Edition; pp. 1316.) 21. E Protein C activation is controlled by several different mechanisms, including by thrombomodulin. Protein C activation and thrombin generation are tightly coupled. Acquired and hereditary deficiencies are the primary cause of thrombophilia. (Nathan, DG, et al. Nathan and Oski's Hematology of Infancy and Childhood, 5th Edition; pp. 1545-1547.) 22. E In contrast to heparin, which acts as a cofactor with antithrombin III to prevent coagulation, the plasminogen activators, urokinase, streptokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator increase fibrinolysis, thereby lysing the clot. Plasminogen is cleaved into plasmin by these activators. Plasmin lyses clot directly. All of the other statements are correct. (Rogers, MC, et al.

E Both heparin and plasminogen activators (streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator) may be used to treat arterial thrombosis. The partial thromboplastin time should be kept 1.5-2.0 times normal during heparin therapy.

A, B, B, B Organophosphates bind irreversibly to acetylcholinesterase (the enzyme that normally hydrolyses acetylcholine). As a result, acetylcholine accumulates at the synaptic site with subsequent continuous stimulation of the neuromuscular junction. Clinical manifestations are fasciculations, weakness, and paralysis.

E The pulse oximetry detects the ratio of oxy-Hb to the total Hb and is incapable of measuring the other different types of Hb, such as carboxy-Hb or met-Hb. Therefore, the saturation that is obtained may be erroneous. Under these circumstances, one has to measure the oxygen saturation using the co-oximeter.(Rogers MC, et al.
