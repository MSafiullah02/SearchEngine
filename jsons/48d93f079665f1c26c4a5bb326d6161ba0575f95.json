            "text": "The evidence behind this controversy comes anecdotally from an infectious diseases specialist in France who reported four cases of worsening symptoms of COVID-19, 1 which we could not identify in the published literature. The second source was a letter written by Fang et al, 4 where they claimed that ibuprofen may worsen associated symptoms in those infected with COVID-19. They argued that coronaviruses bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, and ibuprofen administration can increase the bioavailability of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, therefore potentiating and enhancing the infectious processes of coronaviruses. 4 One needs to be cautious on drawing conclusions from evidence that is derived from mechanistic or theoretical pharmacology. There are a number of examples in the literature where evidence from mechanistic studies is not always corroborated with data from clinical trials. For example, some studies have shown that coadministration of ibuprofen with aspirin can counteract the antiplatelet effectiveness of aspirin when thromboxane levels are measured. 5 This hypothesis, however, was refuted in a large randomized controlled trial. 6 Evidence on the safety of Ibuprofen in Respiratory Infections Other investigators 7 have also advocated to not use ibuprofen based on previous studies that have shown negative outcomes among ibuprofen users. For example, a database study from France found that patients who had prehospitalization use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for symptoms of communityacquired pneumonia developed more severe pneumonia and stayed hospitalized longer than nonusers. 8 Another study examined risk factors for complicated community-acquired infection in children. 9 Both ibuprofen (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.11-9.65) and acetaminophen (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.37-5.23) were identified as risk factors. 9 Epidemiologic studies that have identified ibuprofen with negative respiratory outcomes are subject to a number of biases. These biases include protopathic bias, where ibuprofen is used to relieve symptoms of a viral infection, including COVID-19, making it seem like ibuprofen is the culprit. Confounding by disease severity (also referred to as channeling bias) should also be considered in many of these studies, especially those which compared this risk with nonusers. Patients with more severe viral infections including influenza or COVID-19 are more likely to use a stronger antiinflammatory drug such as ibuprofen than acetaminophen. Therefore, a potential harmful outcome is more likely to be caused by a more severe infection for which ibuprofen is prescribed, rather than the drug.",
