Patients undergoing elective open-heart surgery at St. Michael's Hospital, Totonto, Canada between March 1997 and March 2003 were screened for S. aureus nasal carriage two weeks before surgery. Only colonized patients were enrolled in the study after giving their informed consent. Patients were randomized to receive either 2% mupirocin ointment or an identical-appearing placebo administered intranasally (with a Q-tip cotton applicator to the vestibule of both nares) twice daily for seven days before surgery. Mupirocin 2% was contained in a base of polyethylene glycol 400 and polyethylene glycol 3350, and placebo contained the base only. The randomization numbers were computer generated with a 1:1 ratio for mupirocin and placebo, and the code was available to the research pharmacist. A research assistant contacted the patients directly to screen for side effects. Standard pre-operative clinical practice included a full shower or bath with chlorhexidine antiseptic soap (2%) 12 h pre-operatively, surgical site cleansing with 4% chlorhexdine solution with 4% isopropyl alcohol pre-operatively, and administration of routine antibiotic prophylaxis starting just before surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of cefazolin 1 g every 8 h (or clindamycin in those with penicillin allergy) for 24 h.",

Nasal cultures were obtained two weeks before surgery and again at admission just prior to surgery. Wound swabs or aspirates were obtained postoperatively under aseptic conditions from any wound with evidence of inflammation (redness, tenderness, swelling or fluctuance). Intra-operative wound cultures were obtained from patients having surgical wound drainage or debridement and blood cultures were obtained from all febrile and septic patients. Prospective wound surveillance was carried out by a research assistant, who reviewed microbiology logs and nursing reports to detect potential wound infections on a bi-weekly basis. All patients were treated equally, as the research assistant was unaware of the randomization assignment. Each surgeon completed a formal postdischarge surveillance six to eight weeks after surgery. General practitioners (GPs) and patients were contacted by telephone twice monthly to ensure the absence of wound infections following discharge. Additionally, patients were asked to telephone the investigators if they developed signs of infection. Wound infections were classified as superficial, deep or deep organ space infections according to the Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System definitions.7 A surgical site infection (SSI) was defined by the occurrence of one of the following within eight weeks of surgery: the presence of exudate from the wound, the edges of the wound were erythematous beyond 2 cm margin the wound culture yielded a pathogen with signs of inflammation, or a physician stated in the medical record that the surgical site was infected as corroborated by one or more of the listed criteria.",

The secondary endpoints were the rates of S. aureus infections, the rates of overall nosocomial infections and nosocomial S. aureus infections, the rates of nasal S. aureus clearance, and the rates of deaths and complications due to infections. The patients were initially analysed according to intention-to-treat and the actual treatment applied. Data were analysed using SPSS. Categorical variables were compared in univariate analysis using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were analysed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test.

The SSI rates with S. aureus are probably too low to detect a difference with the sample size enrolled, and this is also true of the other randomized studies. In retrospect, the expected SSI rate in subjects colonized with S. aureus was overestimated. Another factor of importance is that some of the wound infections reported by GPs were not confirmed by any of the investigators or corroborated by microbiological cultures. Moreover, it was surprising that 46% of the placebo patients cleared nasal S. aureus colonization before surgery, which could have resulted in low S. aureus SSI rates. These results are in contrast to other randomized studies. Nasal carriage of S. aureus was eliminated in 83.4% of patients treated with mupirocin and 27.4% treated with placebo in the study by Perl et al.\n33 In residents of long-term-care facilities, mupirocin eradicated S. aureus colonization in 93% of patients compared with 15% in the placebo group.28 The reason for the high rate of nasal S. aureus elimination in the placebo group in the present study is unclear. It should be noted that mupirocin could be purchased without a prescription in Ontario prior to 2000, thus raising the question of compliance with the assigned treatment regimen.",
