According to an international multi-centre research, the prevalence of ARDS was 10.4% of ICU admissions [1]. Inflammatory responses destroy underlying vascular endothelial cells and respiratory epithelial cells and impair the lungs\u2019 ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide [2]. Therefore, decreasing inflammation and accelerating blood vessel repair are two key factors in the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Since its severity and lack of effective pharmacologic treatments [3], it is of great significance to explore novel therapeutic strategies for ARDS. Recently, cell therapy have been shown to have promising therapeutic potential. Mesenchymal stem cells ameliorated ARDS due to paracrine mechanism [4].",

The catalytic subunits bind to p85 regulatory subunits, activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and transmit a variety of cell surface receptor signals, such as those from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), to promote cell growth [12]. The PI3K subunits p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b4 were demonstrated to be associated with tissue repair; however, this function is mediated by different mechanisms. The activity of PI3K p110\u03b1 can be enhanced by tyrosine kinase ligands, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A, and can induce angiogenesis and vascular remodelling [13]. Moreover, p110\u03b1 regulates endothelial cell migration through the small GTPase RhoA, mediated by PI3KCG, a gene encoding a p110\u03b3 subunit, which has a protective effect on hypoxic-reoxygenated cardiomyocytes mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and inhibition of apoptosis [14]. PI3K (p110\u03b4)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway mediates interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) induced airway epithelial cell growth and proliferation through interaction with CEACAM1 [15].",

MiR-135a can influence cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and tumour angiogenesis through the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [16]. Mature miR-21a-5p was found to be secreted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages in small vesicles, which were endocytosed and internalised by renal fibroblasts, thereby promoting the expression of fibrosis and inflammation markers in a mouse model of chronic renal allograft dysfunction (CAD) in allogeneic kidney transplantation [17]. Antagonism of miR-21a-5p ameliorated CAD in mouse model following kidney transplantation [17].

Given that miRNAs usually negatively regulate downstream genes, E2F8, EFNB2, and EPAS1 were further studied. LPS stimulation significantly increased miR-21a-3p and miR-221-5p expression in TCs compared with that in cells under control conditions. To clarify the relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs, miRNA inhibitors were applied. MiR-221-5p inhibition restored the expression of EPAS1 but not EFNB2, and miR-21a-3p inhibition restored the expression of E2F8 but not EPAS1. MiR-21 had been reported to increase proliferation, migration and tube formation of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and induce angiogenesis by directly targeting PTEN [30, 31]. Moreover, miR-21a-3p and its downstream target E2F8 were further studied. After 24 h, the protein expression of E2F8 was decreased in TCs challenged with LPS and was restored by inhibition of miR-21a-3p. The dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that E2F8 was the direct target of miR-21a-3p (Fig. 4).",

The mRNA levels of the Class I PI3K isoforms PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD did not significantly change with LPS stimulation. However, the protein level of p110\u03b1 in TCs was significantly increased with LPS stimulation and decreased with miR-21a-3p inhibitor co-treatment. The PI3K signalling molecules AKT, mTOR, and PTEN were unaffected by either LPS or miR-21a-3p.

The proliferation assay indicated that EOMA cells proliferation decreased with LPS stimulation but was restored by co-culture with TCs. Inhibition of miR-21a-3p or p110\u03b1 (with its inhibitor HS-173) weakened the protective effect of TCs (Fig. 7b, d). The scratch assay showed similar results (Fig. 7c, e). VEGF protein expression was significantly elevated with LPS stimulation, and this increase was reversed by inhibition of either miR-21a-3p or p110\u03b1 (Fig. 7f).

MiR-221-5p [38], miR-146a-5p [39], and miR-21a-3p [40\u201342] are reported to be associated with the angiogenesis process. MiR-21a-3p and miR-221-5p were demonstrated to be involved in the promotion of angiogenesis in TCs. As miR-21a-3p was more frequently reported on angiogenesis, it was further studied. MiR-21a-3p knockdown in TCs reduced CD31 and eNOS expression in the lungs of ARDS mice in vivo. MiR-21a-3p exerts its protective effects on injury repair by inducing angiogenesis-associated signalling pathways. For instance, miR-21a-3p activates the AKT pathway and increases matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression to reduce the extent of the infarcted region in heart ischaemia/reperfusion injury [41], inhibits PTEN and sprouty homolog 1 (SPRY1) to heal soft tissue wounds [40], and upregulates VEGF and activates the Ang-1/Tie-2 axis in traumatic brain injury [42]. In the current study, the p110\u03b1 isoform in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in miR-21a-3p-mediated angiogenic factor induction in TCs. However, the alteration of other protein levels and HIF-1\u03b1 in TCs treated with LPS and the miR-21a-3p inhibitor indicated that more complex signalling pathways were involved in regulating the angiogenic function of TCs. Culture medium from LPS-induced TCs promoted EOMA cells proliferation in vitro, accompanied by elevated levels of VEGF mRNA and secretion, which further demonstrated that the functional miR-21a-3p was generated by TCs. These data support the hypothesis that miR-21a-3p plays a role in angiogenesis and profoundly demonstrate the mechanisms mediated by PI3K p110\u03b1.",

E2F7/8 has been reported to positively regulate the formation of blood vessels during embryonic development via HIF-1\u03b1/VEGFA signalling [33].

            "text": "TCs have been reported to be important in tissue repair and healing processes. Via mouse models, bioinformatics approaches and molecular biological methods, the present study shows that activated TCs promote endothelial regeneration and angiogenesis through miR-21a-3p-PI3K (p110\u03b1)/AKT/mTOR signalling and further demonstrates the key roles of VEGF in TCs. The E2F8/Notch2 signalling might also participates in this process. These findings shed light on miR-21a-3p in TCs as a new therapeutic target for vessel protection.",
