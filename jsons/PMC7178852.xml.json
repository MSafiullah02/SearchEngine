Viral infection leads to an inflammatory cascade in which T-helper type 1 cytokine polarization is associated with a high level of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2 and interferon-\u03b3. There is also an associated release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8. These cytokines are considered very potent chemoattractants for neutrophils [4]. The viral induction of the inflammatory cascade results in acute mucosal edema, occlusion of sinus ostia, and impairment of mucociliary clearance. The resulting mucus stasis can contribute to a milieu that favors the proliferation of pathogenic micro-organisms, resulting in acute bacterial sinusitis.",

Structural concerns, such as concha bullosa or septal deviation, may be clinically significant. Inflammatory conditions such as nasal polyposis may predispose to acute sinusitis by gross obstruction of sinus drainage by polyps, as well as by generalized mucosal edema. Environmental exposures should be considered, although the evidence for their associations can be variable. For example smoking is thought to be a risk factor for ARS by disrupting ciliary function [1], but the evidence for passive smoke exposure as a significant risk factor is less compelling [5]. Host immune factors such immunodeficiency or immunosuppression can be important risk factors, whereas the role of allergy in ARS is the subject of considerable debate, with studies both supporting and challenging its role [6, 7].",

            "text": "While acute sinusitis typically affects the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, progression of disease to involve the frontal sinus may be influenced by anatomic variations of the superior aspect of the ethmoid sinus that may affect frontal sinus drainage. Because the frontal sinus is embryologically derived from pneumatization of the ethmoid, frontal sinus outflow is thus influenced and defined by the degree of pneumatization of the ethmoid labyrinth. A variety of ethmoid-derived structures that comprise the frontal recess can thus narrow the outflow tract and predispose to acute frontal sinusitis. These structures may include agger nasi cells anteriorly; the bulla lamella and suprabullar/frontal bullar cells posteriorly; supraorbital ethmoid cells laterally; and type I\u2013IV frontal cells comprising variable spatial orientations within the frontal recess [8]. A recent study found that the presence of frontoethmoid cells in the posterior and posterolateral aspects of the frontal recess (suprabullar cells, frontal bullar cells, and supraorbital ethmoid cells) may have a more significant association with the development of frontal sinusitis than those cells in the anterior aspect of the frontal recess [9].",

A recent Cochrane review found that nasal irrigation with saline has limited benefit in shortening the duration of illness in adults with ARS, although it may be considered for symptomatic relief (level 1a) [21]. There is no evidence to support the use of antihistamines, either oral or intra-nasal, in the treatment ABRS, except in patients with co-existing allergic rhinitis. Also, there is no evidence that the use of nasal or oral decongestants alters the course of ARS, although they may be indicated for alleviating acute symptoms [1, 10].",

External drainage via frontal sinus trephination is an alternative option and may be more facile for the less experienced surgeon.

If cultures can be obtained, these should be performed expeditiously so as to not interfere with the initiation of intravenous antibiotics. If cultures are not possible, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately, choosing broad spectrum agents that have favorable penetration of the blood-brain barrier. As mentioned previously, a significant percentage of cultures from patients with intracranial complications are negative. This may perhaps occur because antibiotic therapy is often initiated emergently before cultures can be obtained. The duration of antimicrobial treatment varies with the nature and severity of the complication, as well as the response to initial therapy. Depending on the degree of morbidity, many patients with complicated acute frontal sinusitis will require continuation of intravenous antibiotic therapy as an outpatient after resolution of the acute phase of illness.
