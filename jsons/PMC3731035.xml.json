            "text": "We performed a prospective, observational study of premature infants in 2 NICUs in Syracuse, NY, during 1 calendar year (2009). Infants were eligible if they were born at less than 33 weeks, 0 days gestational age (GA), and were available for enrollment within 3 days of arrival in the NICU, which included transfer from another facility or following hospital birth. Neonates with medical and surgical diagnoses were included. GA was determined by menstrual dates and confirmed by ultrasound. Infants were excluded if they had a known or suspected immune deficiency, or were born to a human immunodeficiency virus-positive mother. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal specimens were collected using flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc, Corona, California) from each infant by study personnel trained in the proper procedure for obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen (including intubated infants to ensure sample consistency) within 3 days of birth and on a regular twice weekly (Monday/Thursday) schedule thereafter until discharge. Sampling was deferred on a particular day if the procedure was deemed to place the infant at risk. Specimens were placed in 1.5 mL universal transport media (Copan) and frozen at \u221270\u00b0C prior to testing with the xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP; Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). RVP is a multiplex PCR assay that detects influenza A H1, H3, and nonspecific; influenza B; RSV A and B; PIV 1, 2, 3, and 4; coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU-1, and OC43; rhinovirus/enterovirus; adenovirus; and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical records. At each sampling timepoint, the use of mechanical ventilation and percent of inspired oxygen was recorded, along with the results of any microbiologic testing performed for appropriate clinical purposes. Clinical events (episodes of oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, or apnea) were recorded daily according to the existing criteria being used routinely by the nursing staff in both NICUs. To qualify as an event, the aforementioned change had to persist for longer than 20 seconds. Oxygen saturation below 88% and a heart rate below 100 beats per minute were the cutoff points used for desaturation and bradycardia events, respectively. Clinical deteriorations were defined as a sustained (lasting 3 days) increase in daily oxygen desaturation events from the prior baseline rate, an increase in oxygen requirement (as judged by the current inhaled oxygen concentration required for stable oxygen saturations, excluding transient desaturations associated with feeding), or an increased level of respiratory support (moving from nasal cannula to continuous positive airways pressure, or to intubation or mechanical ventilation). A diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made if an infant required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks post-conceptional age.",

All direct patient contact by medical staff required gloves. Contact precautions also were in place (gown and glove) for patients known to be colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA screening by PCR was performed on all patients at the regional center on a weekly basis. All children (age 17 years and younger) were excluded from the units and adult visitors were excluded if ill. Parents who had respiratory symptoms were discouraged from visiting but allowed to visit if they wore gowns, gloves, and a surgical mask. In the regional center NICU, twin and triplet births were separated into different nursing areas. No healthcare personnel were aware of the results of the respiratory virus detection tests during the study.",

The marginal effects of several variables, including NICU units, sex, GA, and birth weight on time to infection were presented by Kaplan-Meier infection-free probability curves and tested by Log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was further fitted to examine the effect of each covariate, adjusting the effect of other covariates. A random-effect term was included to adjust the dependence among the multiple observations from the same infant. The proportional hazards assumption and possible outliers were visually examined through Schoenfeld and deviance residual plots. A path model, focusing on the direct and indirect effects of infection on the hospital stay, was proposed and confirmed by using SAS v. 9.2 PROC CALIS (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) under which the algorithm was optimized via a Quasi-Newton method. Statistical significance was defined at a level of P = .05.",

Eighteen samples (28% of the positive swabs) included more than 1 virus, and some infants were positive for different viruses at different times. There was evidence of seasonality of detection of particular viruses, with clusters observed (Figure 1\n). Fourteen patients had sequentially positive specimens for the same virus, with specimens positive over a range of 3-13 days; however, because we obtained specimens only twice weekly, an accurate determination of duration cannot be made.

The detection of viral nucleic acid from the respiratory tract of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infants (none of the infants were evaluated for RVI by the NICU clinicians) raises the question of whether these events represent true infection. In the absence of data documenting seroconversion, our observation documenting 14 instances of prolonged serial detection suggest ongoing virus replication rather than transient carriage. Moreover, of the viruses included in the detection panel, only adenovirus is known to persist in the nasopharynx, although respiratory viruses have been detected in asymptomatic older children. Detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal secretions in our study correlated significantly and directly with several specific negative outcomes, raising the possibility of a causal relationship.

Infants with detectable RVIs, even those without overt symptoms, required more supplemental oxygen, had a high likelihood of mechanical ventilation, required longer durations of oxygenation, and were hospitalized longer. Persistent detection of virus was associated with clinical deteriorations. In addition, there was a higher rate of BPD in the virus-infected population, an observation worthy of further study. The expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung have been implicated in the etiology of BPD,11 in association with chorioamnionitis,12 and prolonged mechanical ventilation.13, 14 Nosocomial RVIs may exacerbate inflammation attributable to positive pressure ventilation, prematurity, and/or supplemental oxygen therapy, and may contribute to the development of chronic lung disease of prematurity.

The potential for cross-contamination of specimens was limited by collection of samples in separate sealed containers using universal precautions. Laboratory contamination was limited by using dedicated, trained personnel and strict sample identification identical to that employed for our hospital\u2019s clinical laboratory. Sample containers remained sealed from collection until laboratory RNA extraction. To ensure a consistent sample set throughout the year, the collection schedule was adhered to as much as reasonably practical with exceptions made only for times when an infant could not be tested safely, and repeated attempts were made as soon as possible. There were no weeks when specimen collection did not occur. A limitation of our study is the difficulty in proving that detection of an RVI is due to ongoing viral replication. Seroconversion data might support this supposition, but this testing was not performed. In addition, the association between detection of an RVI and prolonged hospitalization, increased requirements for oxygenation and respiratory support, and a higher rate of BPD does not prove causation.",

These practices included the use of barriers (gowns and gloves), hand washing before and after each patient contact, the use of masks for anyone with respiratory symptoms, and the exclusion of all children. During this study, we did not explore the sources of infection; however, most of the infants had contact only with their parents and the healthcare personnel. We noted that several twin infants had identical viruses detected at the same time, despite being in separate nursing areas. Our findings highlight the limitations of current infection control practices and raise questions as to whether the presence or sequelae of these infections justify more intensive monitoring of infections and assessment of strategies of prevention and control.",
