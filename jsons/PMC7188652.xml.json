The patient suffered for years of arterial hypertension in treatment with ace-inhibitor and calcium channel blocker and in 2014 he had undergone open repair of a 60 mm abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 14/7 mm bifurcated aorto-bi-iliac dacron graft. Since then he was in treatment with 100 mg/die of acetylsalicylic acid. In January 2019 a duplex ultrasound (DUS) exam had demonstrated the patency of the graft, the absence of pseudoaneurysms or stenosis, and a normal flow of the femoral-popliteal-tibial axis in both legs. At the admission, the abdomen was treatable, femoral and peripheral pulses normally present at both legs. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 89% in air, Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) in air showed pH 7.47, PaCO2 29, PaO2 57, Hb 15, SaO2 89.7, HCO3- 22. The thoracic ultrasound demonstrated moderate bilateral B-lines without pleural effusion. At the thoracic RX interstitial thickenings in the medium and basal right field with prevalent mantellar distribution were showed. Sars-Cov-2 swab was executed with positive result.",

Moreover, thrombotic prophylaxis with subcutaneous enoxaparin (50 IU/kg per day) was initiated. In the following days the ABG values got worse, with a drop of Horowitz Index (HI) under 100 despite the ventilation with reservoir. On march 25th, due to the worsening of respiratory exchanges, the patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). At that moment he had fever and dyspnea. Blood tests showed Fibrinogen 432 mg/dL, D-Dimer 754 ng/mL, IL-6 19.6 pg/mL and PCR 107 mg/L. CPAP ventilation was initiated (PEEP 8-FiO2 80%), therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was continued, and the patient also started, in the absence of contraindications, the therapeutic protocol currently used in our hospital with methylprednisolone 80 mg and tocilizumab (2 doses). Respiratory exchanges got worse (HI 64) and the patient was intubated and pronated immediately. On march 31st the patient suddenly showed pallor and hypothermia of both legs, with moire starting from the transverse umbilical line. Femoral and peripheral pulses were absent in both legs. Blood tests showed D-dimer 104822 ng/mL, CPK 1124 U/L, myoglobin 33327 ng/mL, LDH 1124 U/L, IL-6 >200 pg/mL. Continuous intravenous administration of sodium heparin at anticoagulant dosage (1000 IU/h) was immediately started. A bedside DUS showed the patency of the suprarenal aorta and of the renal arteries and the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without detectable blood-flow at the femoral level. An angio-computed tomography (CT) scan was immediately requested for an intended attempt of hybrid revascularization with bilateral femoral surgical access and thrombectomy under fluoroscopic guide. However, upon the arrival in the radiological suite the patient presented severe hypotension not respondent to the infusion of amine at high dosage, bradycardia and, later, pulseless electrical activity. Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation the patient presented flatline and the death was declared.",

            "text": "Sars-Cov-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications due to inflammation, stasis and hypercoagulable status.4\n,\n5 The majority of the reported cases deal with venous thromboembolism, whereas few arterial thromboses are reported.1\n,\n6 Moreover, at the moment no cases regarding thrombosis of prosthesis and vascular stents are reported. We reported the case of acute thrombosis of a prosthetic aortic graft in a patient with severe COVID19 related infection. Aortic graft thrombosis is an uncommon event, accounting for less than 1% of all aortic reconstructions, and it is favored by concurrent conditions as proximal and distal anastomosis stenosis or severe occlusive disease of the outflow vessels.7 In the present case, the patient did not show any signs of distal hypoperfusion at the admission, and the most recent outpatient examination had demonstrated normal patency of graft without proximal or distal significant disease. As a consequence, the only possible explanation for such an event was hypercoagulability and inflammation, as supported by the laboratory tests, showing very high levels of D-Dimer and IL-6. This finding can explain why thrombosis did not occur immediately at hospitalization but after a few days, in the moment when the inflammatory response in the patient was hyperactivated, as reported in the late stages of the infection.8 The patient was on heparin therapy at the prophylactic dose of 50 IU/kg, which has not been enough to prevent the acute thrombotic event.9 It is reasonable to think that, if a patient with Sars-Cov-2 infection has a higher thrombotic risk, this will be much higher in a patient with a vascular prosthesis. For this reason, it can be suggested that patients with vascular prosthesis could be considered a selected subgroup, in which, in case of COVID19, it is probably necessary to start an aggressive treatment with heparin at therapeutic dosage. Acute aortic thrombosis is a condition associated with high mortality. Even in our case the patient, who already showed very bad general condition due to the COVID19, died. If the general conditions would have allowed it, the planning would have been a hybrid revascularization attempt, with bilateral surgical access and thrombectomy under fluoroscopic guide. In our opinion, it would have been the best treatment for this condition.",
