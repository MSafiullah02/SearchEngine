Due to the highly infectious and pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2, the public has shown excessive anxiety and even panic. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic non-specific intestinal disease, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and many of these patients have anxiety [3] . The anxiety not only comes from the intestinal diseases that already exist, the current epidemic situation of COVID-19 has also made their anxiety worse. Emotions are an important part of the management of IBD patients, because a less optimistic attitude can make their bowel symptoms recur [4] .",

            "text": "Immune disorders in IBD patients, coupled with current research reports, are IBD patients more susceptible to COVID-19? We could obtain some information from the public IBD database [8] . After screening, a total of 23 UCs, 37 CDs, and 21 non-IBDs were included in the analysis (Table 1) . Each subject had paired tissue samples of rectal and terminal ileal biopsies. Analysis of the transcriptome data of these samples, we found that the expression of ACE2 in the terminal ileum was significantly higher than that in the rectal colon, with a fold change of 9.8 times (P < 0.001). The expression of ACE2 in the UC rectum was not significantly higher than that in non-IBD. In the terminal ileum of CD, ACE2 expression was also not higher than that of non-IBD. At the protein level, ACE2 was not higher in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls [9] . These results indicate that the expression of ACE2 does not show a significant difference between IBD and non-IBD patients. In addition, TMPRSS2 expression is lower in the terminal ileum than in the rectum (P = 0.005). Compared with non-IBD, there was no significant difference in TMPRSS2 expression in the rectum and terminal ileum of patients with IBD. Therefore, we speculate that patients with IBD may not be susceptible to COVID-19. However, this is only a theoretical guess, and we need to further understand the actual risk of COVID-19 in IBD patients. At least, in theory, IBD patients don't need to be overly worried and anxious. Like everyone else, personal protection is an important measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
