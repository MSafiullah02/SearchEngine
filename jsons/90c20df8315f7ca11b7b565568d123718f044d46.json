It measures the average number of people that will be infected by a single contagious individual. A value of Reff > 1 suggests that an outbreak will occur, while Reff < 1 suggests the virus will die out. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide are implementing a range of intervention measures, such as population-wide social distancing and case isolation, with the goal of reducing Reff to values below one, to slow or eliminate transmission. We analyse case data from 25 international locations to estimate their Reff values over time and to assess the effectiveness of interventions, equivalent to New Zealand's Alert Levels 1-4, for reducing transmission. Our results show that strong interventions, equivalent to NZ's Alert Level 3 or 4, have been successful at reducing Reff below the threshold for outbreak. In general, countries that implemented strong interventions earlier in their outbreak have managed to maintain case numbers at lower levels. These estimates provide indicative ranges of Reff for each Alert Level, to inform parameters in models of COVID-19 spread under different intervention scenarios in New Zealand and worldwide. Predictions from such models are important for informing policy and decisions on intervention timing and stringency during the pandemic.",

A value of R0 > 1 indicates that an outbreak will occur, while R0 < 1 means the virus will die out. During the early phase of an outbreak, the number of infected individuals in a population increases exponentially. As the virus spreads and more people become infected, the number of susceptible individuals (those not yet exposed to the virus) declines and this slows the rate of increase due to herd immunity. Eventually the number of infected individuals reaches a peak and then declines. Larger values of R0 > 1 are associated with a faster increase in the number of infected individuals in a population during the early phase of an outbreak, a higher peak in daily case numbers, and a larger number of cumulative cases at the end of the outbreak.",

Data in the repository were compiled by JHU from multiple sources including the World Health Organisation (full source list in the provided link) and are updated daily. Confirmed cases include presumptive positive cases and, for the USA, death totals include those classified as confirmed and probable. Locations with highest cumulative case totals were selected for analysis provided there was sufficient information available on implemented interventions. We also included locations that were of particular interest due to, for example, their testing/reporting protocols or intervention approach, so long as they had reported at least 1000 cumulative cases. Data on intervention measures was obtained for each location using the International Monetary Fund's Policy Tracker (https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#N), supplemented by information from other sources. We broadly grouped intervention measures into four levels of increasing intensity, equivalent to New Zealand's Alert Level framework (available from: https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/covid-19-alertsystem/#covid-19-alert-system): Level 1 -Prepare, Level 2 -Reduce, Level 3 -Restrict, and Level 4 -Eliminate.

Doubling time Td is related to r by Td = ln(2)/r.

This makes it challenging to directly compare Reff estimates between countries. For some locations, our Reff values estimated from daily case numbers differed from the estimates obtained using daily number of deaths. For instance, nine out of twelve countries had higher estimates of late-phase Reff fitted to daily deaths compared to daily cases (though these were not statistically significant).

For example, a recent study by Russell et al (2020) assessed the extent of under-reporting of symptomatic COVID-19 cases globally; six out of these nine countries had reported fewer than 10% of symptomatic cases. Our approach does not account for transmission by asymptomatic individuals, who can still spread the virus but are not reported in case numbers (Lavezzo et al, 2020) . Additionally, the lag between an individual being exposed to the virus and being confirmed as infectious by testing, means the full extent of the reduction in Reff after interventions, will not be observable in case data until several days after interventions are begun. Our results indicate this lag could be at least 1-2.5 weeks (see results in Appendix).",

For example, we obtained similar late-phase Reff estimates but higher early-phase estimates than a global study by Abbott et al. (2020) , which used an approach based on Thompson et al (2019) . Our approach differs from Abbott et al (2020) because we do not account for reporting delays, right censoring of confirmation dates, or imported cases. Our estimates therefore exhibit higher uncertainty and are likely inflated by imported cases, particularly in the early phase. These additional factors should be addressed before obtaining estimates from New Zealand case data.",

This was fitted to estimates of the times between infection of 40 source-recipient case pairs (Ferreti et al, 2020) and is subject to uncertainty. Other groups have estimated longer mean generation times (Flaxman et al 2020; Li et al, 2020) . This would result in our method returning higher estimates for Reff in the initial phase before interventions. However, it would have less of an effect on the relative reduction in Reff as a result of interventions. Two other recent international studies have examined the effects of control interventions on exponential growth rates (Hsiang et al., 2020) and Reff (Flaxman et al., 2020) for COVID-19. We have taken a simpler theoretical approach to calculate and compare growth rates and Reff, however our estimates show reasonable agreement to values estimated in both studies and agree with the general result that Reff is considerably reduced by strong (e.g. lockdown-level) interventions.",
