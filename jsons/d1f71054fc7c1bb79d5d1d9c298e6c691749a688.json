Using DAIO, we performed a systematic study of the proteomes of all human Herpesviridae species to define Strict Ortholog Groups (SOGs). In addition to assessing the taxonomic distribution for each protein based on sequence similarity, we performed a protein domain-architecture analysis for every protein family and computationally inferred gene duplication events. While many herpesvirus proteins have evolved without any detectable gene duplications or domain rearrangements, numerous herpesvirus protein families do exhibit complex evolutionary histories. Some proteins acquired additional domains (e.g., DNA polymerase), whereas others show a combination of domain acquisition and gene duplication (e.g., betaherpesvirus US22 family), with possible functional implications. This novel classification system of SOGs for human Herpesviridae proteins is available through the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR, www.viprbrc.org).",

Human diseases caused by herpesviruses range from vesicular rashes to cancer. The order Herpesvirales is subdivided into three families, including the Herpesviridae, which is further subdivided into three subfamilies, the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae. Within subfamilies, groups of related herpesvirus species are classified into genera. The nine species of human herpesviruses are distributed across the three subfamilies and several genera (Table 1) ; these viruses are the main focus of this work. Prior studies found that the Beta-and Gammaherpesvirinae are more closely related to each other than to Alphaherpesvirinae (Montague and Hutchison, 2000) . In contrast to some other human viruses, the human herpesviruses have a long evolutionary history, with evidence suggesting that the primordial herpesvirus diverged into the Alpha-, Beta, and Gammaherpesvirinae approximately 180 million to 220 million years ago (McGeoch et al., 1995) . Coupled with their genome complexity and the availability of numerous complete genome sequences, this deep evolutionary history makes herpesviruses a tractable and informative model to study virus genome evolution at the levels of gene duplication and protein domain rearrangement. Nehrt et al., 2011; Rogozin et al., 2014) , due to its importance for computational sequence functional analysis (Eisen, 1998; Zmasek and Eddy, 2002) and the significance of gene duplications for biological evolution (Zhang, 2003) .",

            "text": "Many eukaryotic proteins, and by extension, proteins of eukaryotic viruses, are composed of multiple domains, components that can each have their own evolutionary history and functional implications. The architecture of a protein is a product of the ordered arrangement of its several domains and their overall tertiary structure. Evolutionarily, individual domains can combine with other partner domains, enabling formation of a vast number of domain combinations, even within the same species (Moore et al., 2008) . Assembling multiple domains into a single protein creates a distinct entity that can be more than the sum of its constituent parts. The emergence of proteins with novel combinations of duplicated and then diverged domains is considered to be a major mechanism for rapid evolution of new functionality in eukaryotic genomes (Itoh et al., 2007; Peisajovich et al., 2010) . It is especially important in the evolution of pathways, where novel linkages between existing domains may result in the rearrangement of pathways and their behaviors in the cell (Peisajovich et al., 2010) . The modular structure of eukaryotic proteins provides a mechanism that enables evolutionarilyrapid differentiation and emergence of a multitude of novel protein functions from an initially limited array of functional domains. Proteins can gain (or lose) new domains via genome rearrangements, creating (or removing) domain combinations, in addition to modification of domains themselves by small-scale mutations (Patthy, 2003; Ye and Godzik, 2004) .",

This analysis resulted in the classification of proteins into \"Strict Ortholog Groups\" (SOGs), in which all proteins are orthologous to each other (related by speciation events) and exhibit the same domain architecture. The SOG classification also enabled the development of an informative name convention for each SOG that includes information about the protein's function (if known) and a suffix indicating the taxonomic distribution of the protein. For example, an \"aBG\" suffix would indicate that proteins of this group are found in some (but not all) human Alphaherpesvirinae species (lowercase \"a\"), and all human Beta-and Gammaherpesvirinae species (uppercase \"B\" and \"G\"). Such suffixes allow for the quick understanding of presumed conserved protein function and minimal common genome across the Herpesviridae family.

In our global hmmscan analysis (applying the same threshold of E = 10 \u22126 for every Pfam domain) Evalue support for presence of this domain in some strains is strong (E < 10 -22 ) and matching over the entire Pfam model while other HCMV strains do not exhibit significant sequence similarity with this domain. It has been suggested that this domain polymorphism may be implicated in HCMV-induced immunopathogenesis, as well as in strainspecific behaviors, such as tissue-tropism and the ability to establish persistent or latent infections (Pignatelli et al., 2004) . In our new systemic naming approach (see below) we term the SOG of the protein with HCMVantigenic_N domain \"Glycoprotein B_ ABG.b\", whereas all other proteins fall into the \"Glycoprotein B_ ABG.AbG\" SOG.

Cellular family B DNA polymerases are the main polymerases involved with nuclear DNA replication and repair in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and include DNA polymerases II and B, and polymerases \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03b5 (Garcia- Diaz and Bebenek, 2007) . Family B DNA polymerases are also found in other dsDNA viruses, such as the insect Ascoviridae, and members of the Iridoviridae (e.g., fish lymphocystis disease virus) and Phycoviridae (e.g., chlorella virus) (Villarreal and DeFilippis, 2000) . In addition to these two large and ubiquitous domains, Simplexvirus (which include human simplex virus 1 and 2) and Mardivirus also possess a small C-terminal domain, called the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit Pol (DNAPoly-mera_Pol) domain in Pfam (Zuccola et al., 2000) , and are longer by about 45 aa on average than DNA polymerase proteins from other Herpesviridae. According to currently available genomic data, DNAPo-lymera_Pol is found in members of the Simplexvirus genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae. While varicella-zoster virus (Human herpesvirus 3) and other members of the Varicellovirus genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae possesses DNA polymerases that also tend to be longer, similarity of these protein regions to the DNAPolymera_Pol domain is low, using the current Pfam model for DNAPolymera_Pol (Pfam version 31.0). The function of this third domain is to mediate interaction between DNA polymerase and its cognate processivity factor (Bridges et al., 2000; Loregian et al., 2000) based on the observation that a peptide corresponding to the 27 C-terminal amino acids of HSV-1 DNA polymerase has been shown to inhibit viral replication by disrupting the interaction between DNA polymerase and UL42 (Digard et al., 1995; Loregian et al., 1999) . In this context, it is interesting to note that the DNA polymerase processivity factors are only distantly-related across the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae (see below). It is therefore conceivable that the interactions of Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae DNA polymerase processivity factors with their corresponding DNA polymerases (which lack a DNAPolymera_Pol domain) is different in nature than for Alphaherpesvirinae. As for Varicellovirus it is unclear whether they possess a functional DNAPolymera_Pol domain, and a definitive answer will require similar biochemical assays as have been performed for HSV-1.",

Multifunctional regulator of expression is a regulatory protein that plays a role in the prevention of apoptosis during HSV1 infection (Aubert and Blaho, 1999) . Multifunctional regulator of expression interacts directly with a number of proteins in performing its many roles. In particular, multifunctional regulator of expression protein contributes to host shut-off by inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing by interacting with essential splicing factors, termed SR proteins, and affecting their phosphorylation (Sciabica et al., 2003) . Furthermore, the mRE protein C.M. Zmasek et al.

Besides human Simplexvirus, architectures with C-terminal HHV-1_VABD and N-terminal Herpes_UL69 domains are also found in Chimpanzee herpesviruses (e.g. NCBI Reference Sequence: YP_009011042 (Severini et al., 2013) ), while other non-human Simplexviruses lack the HHV-1_VABD domain.

Processivity factors, also called clamp proteins, help to overcome the tendency of DNA polymerase to dissociate from the template DNA, and thus greatly enhance DNA polymerase processivity (Weisshart et al., 1999; Zhuang and Ai, 2010) . In contrast to the protein families discussed so far, DNA polymerase processivity factors are only distantly-related across the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae. In the Alphaherpesvirinae, the protein is composed of two tandem Herpes_UL42 domains; Betaherpesvirinae have a single Herpe-s_PAP domain; Gammaherpesvirinae have a single Herpes_DNAp_acc domain (Fig. 3A, B, C) . These three domains are very distant homologs and are members of the DNA clamp superfamily (Pfam clan CL0060). gL (Fig. 3D , E, F) is another example of a protein function performed by different, probably non-homologous domains present in different Herpesviridae subfamilies (Pfam domains Herpes_UL1, GlyL_C, Cyto-mega_gL, and Phage_glycop_gL). Interestingly, the open reading frames for these seemingly unrelated proteins are located in analogous conserved genomic contexts, including open reading frame sizes and orientations relative to the surrounding conserved coding regions.",

By comparing this gene tree with a species tree for human Herpesviridae (Fig. 1A) , we can infer three gene duplication events (marked as red squares in Fig. 4) , resulting in four groups of orthologous genes: UL33/U12, US27, U51/ORF74, and US28. In our new nomenclature (see below), we call the first group \"Gprotein coupled receptor homolog UL33/U12_B\" because it is found in all four human Betaherpesvirinae species (uppercase B suffix). The second group is called \"G-protein coupled receptor homolog US27_b\" as it is found in some human Betaherpesvirinae (lowercase b suffix). The third group is called \"G-protein coupled receptor homolog U51/ORF74_bg\" because it found in some human Betaherpesvirinae and in some human Gammaherpesvirinae (lowercase \"bg\" suffix). The fourth group is called \"Envelope protein US28_b\". No orthologous genes were found in the human Alphaherpesvirinae. Whenever available, we base our names preferably on (Mocarski, 2007) or the \"Recommended name\" (under \"Protein names\") from the UniProtKB database (Bateman et al., 2017) . For reasons of consistency and objectivity, we used an automated approach to root all trees by mid-point rooting. It is possible, that the true root for the 7-transmembrane domain proteins tree is at the base of the U51-ORF74 subtree. In this case there would be only two duplications in the tree, but still the same four ortholog groups: U51/ORF74, US28, US27, UL33/U12. Functionally, all these proteins appear to be hijacked human proteins that are being used by the virus to modulate the host immune system. In particular, many of them appear to act as chemokine (orphan) receptors (Casarosa et al., 2003 (Casarosa et al., , 2001 Isegawa et al., 1998; Murphy, 2001; Zhen et al., 2005) (Fig. 5) .",

Most proteins with US22 domains carry two copies of the domain. US22 is a member of a large group of distantly homologous proteins (the SUKH superfamily, Pfam clan CL0526), which, for example include bacterial Syd proteins. It has been suggested that a function of the US22 family is to act against various anti-viral responses by interacting with specific host proteins (Zhang et al., 2011) .",

Unfortunately, the phylogenetic signal across this group of protens is weak, thus some support values are low. Two groups of US22 orthologs span all four human betaherpesviruses: CMV tegument protein UL23 is likely to have orthologs in HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7 (Roseolovirus) Protein U3 (\"Tegument protein UL23/Protein U3_B\"). Similarly, CMV Tegument protein UL43 is likely to be orthologous to HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7 (Roseolovirus) Protein U25 (\"Tegument protein UL43/Protein U25_B\"). U3 and U25 are paralogous towards each other, as they are connected by a gene duplication, as are HCMV UL23 and 43. Four groups of orthologs specific to Roseolovirus are Tegument protein DR1, Tegument protein DR6, Protein U7, and Protein U17/U16. In U17/U16 proteins, it is unclear whether they possess a second US22 domain, as the similarity to this domain is weak to the point of insignificance. In contrast, U7 proteins possess at least three US22 domains and an additional C-terminal Herpes_U5 domain. Proteins U7 are most closely related to CMV UL29, but differ in their domain architecture (lack of Herpes_U5 domain). Thus CMV UL29 forms its own species-specific group of orthologs. Numerous proteins with US22 domains are specific to CMV (and thus all paralogous to each other) given current data: apoptosis inhibitor UL38, early nuclear protein HWLF1, tegument protein UL26, US24, protein UL24, UL29, UL36, US23, US26, protein IRS1, and protein TRS1.

The opposite (false positive), on the other hand, is far less likely. For this work, we used two thresholds: a minimal domain length of 40% of the length set forth in the Pfam database (domain fragments are unlikely to be functionally equivalent to full length domains) and a hmmscan E-value cutoff of E = 10 \u22126 .",
