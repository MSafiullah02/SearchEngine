Genes which bear the mark of some of the most potent selective forces detected in the genomes of humans and our relatives are directly related to combating RNA viruses (Meyerson and Sawyer 2011). Moreover, the ancient history of this association with RNA viruses is evidenced by a diverse array of defective viral remnants incorporated into vertebrate genomes, including mounting support for endogenization of RNA viruses other than Retroviridae (Gifford et al. 2008, Belyi et al. 2010, Gilbert and Feschotte 2010, Horie et al. 2010, Taylor et al. 2010). However, according to molecular dating analyses, many RNA viruses have extraordinarily recent origins (Holmes 2003a).",

            "text": "At first glance, a recent introduction of many RNA viruses into the human population is unsurprising. Epidemiological, historical, and phylogenetic approaches agree that some of the most notable RNA viruses (e.g., HIV-1, Worobey et al. 2008; influenza A virus, Taubenberger et al. 2005; Ebola virus [EBOV] Zaire, Walsh et al. 2005; and SARS coronavirus, Hon et al. 2008) emerged as zoonoses within the last century. As one looks further back in evolutionary time, however, specific inconsistencies arise. For example, defective remnants of ancient integrations of Filoviridae, the viral family containing the EBOV, are found in mammalian lineages that diverged tens of millions of years ago (Belyi et al. 2010, Taylor2010qf), even though molecular dating suggests a time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for Filoviridae on the order of only thousands of years ago (Suzuki and Gojobori 1997). Another inconsistency can be seen in the zoonotic origin of measles virus (MeV) from rinderpest virus (RPV) and peste-des-petits ruminants virus (PPRV), two viruses capable of infecting large and small ruminants, respectively. MeV required at least two conditions to emerge: 1) Humans had to live in close proximity to RPV, which became commonplace only after the domestication of cattle over the last 10,000 years (Perkins 1969, Loftus et al. 1994, Beja-Pereira et al. 2006) and 2) humans needed societies with a population size above 250,000\u2013500,000 to sustain the epidemic, which did not exist until about 5,000 years ago (Black 1966). Furthermore, the first unambiguous historical account of measles dates back to the ninth century (R\u0101z\u012b 1848). Therefore, historical and epidemiological considerations, which place the tMRCA of MeV and RPV at thousands of years ago, are at odds with molecular dating analysis, which infers the tMRCA to be only hundreds of years ago (Furuse et al. 2010).",

Therefore, over longer periods of time, the extent of evolutionary change has been lost. In many viral genes, there is remarkable sequence conservation, indicating that purifying selection is a dominant evolutionary force, acting to maintain evidence of homology by preserving amino acid residues, while allowing nucleotide sequences to continue evolving (Holmes 2003b, Edwards et al. 2006, Pybus et al. 2007). Although the effect of purifying selection on mutations in RNA viruses is becoming better understood (Belshaw et al. 2008), the importance of spatial and temporal variation in selection pressures has not been explicitly explored in the context of tMRCA estimation.",

More recently, Suchard and Rambaut (2009) observed that synonymous substitutions appeared to saturate faster than could be handled by nucleotide models in mitochondrial DNA, which is subject to strong overall purifying selection. Over longer periods of evolutionary time (i.e., along long internal branches on a phylogenetic tree), evidence of evolution at the nucleotide level could be lost, which could bias tMRCA estimates towards younger dates (i.e., underestimate the length of these branches). If a substitution model can account for this evolution, we hypothesize that a comparative analysis of recent viral isolates could be used to make inference about ancient viral divergence events.",

All BMCMC analyses were performed using an uncorrelated lognormal \u00d2relaxed\u00d3 molecular clock and a Bayesian skyline plot coalescent prior, which places the fewest demographic constraints on the analysis (Drummond et al. 2005, Drummond et al. 2006). Tracer v1.5 was used to check for convergence and adequate mixing (i.e., estimated sample size >200 for all relevant parameters). Finally, the maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny was identified and annotated using the posterior distribution of trees. Substitution rates and tMRCAs are reported as mean and 95% highest posterior density values.",

Branches which separated clades containing different viral species (MeV/RPV/PPRV), subtypes (EBOV), and serotypes (AIV) were assigned separate E[\u03b2]/E[\u03b1] ratio parameters because they represent different timescales and selective regimes compared with terminal branches. Longer internal branches are expected to bear the mark of stronger purifying selection (Kosakovsky et al. 2006, Pybus et al. 2007). We considered two variations of this model: Either 1) all long internal lineages share the same ratio parameter, and the remaining branches share another global ratio parameter (two-rate model) or 2) each deep lineage possesses its own ratio parameter, and the remaining branches share a global ratio parameter (multirate model). For each data set, we selected the model with the best Akaike information criterion (AIC) score for further analysis. Note that we use the ratio of the means E[\u03b2]/E[\u03b1]=E[\u03b2] (due to the E[\u03b1]=1 identifiability constraint) instead of the mean of the ratio E[\u03b2/\u03b1]\u2261\u03c9 because \u03b1=0 is possible under Dual and Lineage+Dual models, rendering the mean of the ratio infinite.",

First, an area of parameter space to be sampled is defined by constructing a d-dimensional rectangle, in which each dimension represents a single model parameter, the corresponding coordinate interval is centered on the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter, and the lower and upper bounds are determined by profile likelihood. Second, each coordinate interval is partitioned into N=1,000d subintervals of approximately equal probability, based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the likelihood surface. Third, N samples are drawn from the d-dimensional rectangle, using the Latin Hypercube scheme (i.e., each interval in every coordinate is sampled exactly once).

In this method, three rates are inferred from each site: \u03b1s,\u03b2sI, and \u03b2sT. Subscript s indicates the explicit dependence of substitution rates on the site, from which they are being estimated. \u03b1s is the tree-wide synonymous rate, \u03b2sI is the nonsynonymous rate shared by all internal branches, and \u03b2sT is the nonsynonymous rate shared by all terminal branches. Only internal branches were used to generate empirical selection profiles because substitutions along tips in viral phylogenies are frequently deleterious and transient (Kosakovsky et al. 2006, Pybus et al. 2007). Furthermore, we were primarily interested in the effects of selection on long internal branches, and the IFEL profile (\u03b1s and \u03b2sI inferred for each site) was meant to recapitulate the evolutionary process along an \u201caverage\u201d internal branch. Simulations were initialized using ancestral nucleotide sequences inferred with marginal maximum likelihood reconstruction (Yang et al. 1995) in HyPhy, using the MG94 \u00d7 REV codon substitution model on the MCC phylogeny obtained from BMCMC general time reversible (GTR) + \u03934 analyses. The marginal ancestral sequence was used to provide a realistic starting point for our simulations. Ten thousand replicates were generated for each branch length ranging from 0.01 to 100 expected substitutions per nucleotide site and analyzed under the GTR + \u03934 and Dual substitution models. We chose to simulate branches based on expected substitutions per nucleotide site, instead of per unit time, because of the difficulty in standardizing time for variable rate parameters (i.e., \u03b1s, \u03b2sI, and substitution rate) in a reversible model; the expected number of substitutions divided by the substitution rate can be a proxy for time.",

Therefore, we inferred a substantially younger tMRCA for MeV and RPV: 1490 CE (1130\u20131810 CE), instead of 1171 CE (678\u20131612 CE). We consider our rate estimates more reliable for three reasons. First, our values are in close agreement with previous substitution rate estimates in MeV: 8.69\u00d710\u22124 (5.89\u00d710\u22124\u20131.13\u00d710\u22123) substitutions/site/year (Pomeroy et al. 2008). Second, Furuse et al. (2010) included both MeV and RPV vaccine strains in their BMCMC dating analysis (Rota et al. 1994, Baron et al. 1996), despite evidence that the inclusion of vaccine strains can lead to bias in rate estimation (Bush et al. 2000, Wertheim 2010). Third, Furuse et al. (2010) fitted an exponential growth coalescent prior to viruses whose effective population size has been declining\u2014due to eradication efforts against both MeV and RPV (Moss 2009, Normile 2010). Remarkably, our results are in even greater conflict with the historical documentation of measles (R\u0101z\u012b 1848), further confirming our conjecture that traditional nucleotide substitution models can underestimate the age of ancient viral divergence events.",

The simplest approach, excluding the third codon position in a GTR + \u03934 model, has been used to remove synonymous sites that might have experienced saturation (Worobey et al. 2010). A more sophisticated approach, the SRD06 model (Shapiro et al. 2006), allows first and second codon positions to have a different transition/transversion ratio and \u03934 shape parameter from the third position. Amino acid substitution models have also been successfully implemented to estimate the age of RNA viruses (Zlateva et al. 2005, Wertheim et al. 2009). Finally, we evaluated an available codon-based substitution model, GY94 (Goldman and Yang 1994). Generally, these alternate models either produced younger tMRCAs (e.g., GTR + \u03934 excluding third positions and Whelan and Goldman + \u03934) or tMRCAs that were indistinguishable from GTR + \u03934 (e.g., SRD06 and GY94 + \u03934). A possible exception was analysis of the EBOV data set with GY94 + \u03934, which produced a root tMRCA that was 50% older than the GTR + \u03934 estimate. Finally, as a point of comparison, we also investigated how removing site-to-site rate variation affected dating inference by using a GTR model (Tavar\u00e9 1986); ignoring rate variation invariably produced younger tMRCAs.",

The AIV neuraminidase gene evolved under much stronger selective constraints, with 89% of sites under strong purifying selection. We note that the power to detect selection using IFEL increases with the size of the alignment (Kosakovsky et al. 2006); hence, we would expect more sites evolving under purifying selection to be correctly detected as such in the larger AIV data set. The simulated codon saturation curves varied from virus to virus, indicating that the particular selective regime, amino acid composition, and nucleotide substitution model of each viral gene have a substantial influence on the ability to accurately infer branch lengths. Although underestimation is more pronounced along longer branches (e.g., about half the true length for 1 substitution/site), not accounting for selection can lead to underestimation of branch lengths even for relatively short branches (e.g., 0.2\u20130.5 substitutions/site).",

First, we examined two extremes among nucleotide substitution models that do not adjust for rate variation across sites: JC69 (Jukes and Cantor 1969) and GTR. JC69 assumes a single substitution rate and equal base frequencies, whereas GTR allows each class of nucleotide substitution to occur at a unique rate and estimates base frequencies from the data. As expected, failure to account for site-to-site rate variation led to severe underestimation of longer branches in all three viral data sets (JC69 or GTR vs. GTR + \u03934, fig. 3), reaffirming the importance of modeling site-to-site rate variation to accurate inference. Allowing for multiple substitution rates and empirical base frequencies had a negligible impact on branch length estimation (fig. 3). Underestimation of long branches likely explains why the GTR model inferred younger root tMRCAs for all all three viral data sets (table 1).",

Therefore, we investigated how extensions of the MG94 model that incorporate \u03b2, \u03b1, and lineage-specific rate variation affected branch length inference (table 2). For MeV and AIV, the Lineage+Dual (two-rate) model that allowed longer internal branches to share their own ratio E[\u03b2]/E[\u03b1] provided the best fit to the data. For EBOV, a more complicated (eight-rate) model, in which each intersubtype branch and the long terminal branches leading to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Bundibugyo had their own rates, was fit because E[\u03b2]/E[\u03b1] varied dramatically among the intersubtype branches. The inclusion of variation in \u03b2 and \u03b1 in the Nonsynonymous and Dual models resulted in notable increases in the cumulative length of deep internal branches (table 2; Supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). In all three viral data sets, however, the most substantial differences were seen with the Lineage+Dual model, which produced lengths for long internal branches that were substantially greater than those inferred under GTR + \u03934 (fig. 3). Importantly, the lengths of the more recent intraspecies/subtype/serotype branches were relatively unchanged between these two models for all three data sets; this observation confirms that when the phylogeny is comprised of relatively short branches, it is appropriate to rely on common approximations, such as the GTR + \u03934 model. This increase in the length of only deep internal branches was likely due to the dramatically stronger purifying selection which we inferred along these lineages (table 2). In AIV, for instance, E[\u03b2]/E[\u03b1] was two orders of magnitude lower on deep interior branches, compared with the rest of the tree.",

The same forces of purifying selection that maintain evidence of protein sequence homology over great evolutionary distances also truncate long ancestral branches deep within phylogenetic trees. We observed this pattern in three different groups of rapidly evolving negative-sense RNA viruses: MeV/RPV/PPRV, EBOV, and AIV. Estimating branch lengths under a codon-based substitution model that accounts for spatial and temporal variation in selection pressures yielded phylogenetic trees that were more than twice as long as those obtained under standard nucleotide models. Modeling synonymous, nonsynonymous, and lineage-specific rate variation indicates that current estimates of the age of these, and possibly other, viral lineages may be dramatically underestimated. Codon models used in this study do not circumvent the issue of substitutional saturation but merely extend the horizon further back in evolutionary time; the application of more complex and biologically realistic models is likely to extend these branches even further into the past. Eventually, however, even the most realistic models are likely to fail and external information, such as biogeography and homology to endogenous viral elements, must be brought into consideration to estimate truly ancient events (Katzourakis et al. 2009, Katzourakis and Gifford 2010).",

The domestication of cattle beginning 10,000 years ago provided the necessary exposure to RPV, and the development of agriculture allowed human populations to reach sizes necessary to sustain an epidemic. However, the historical record of measles is ambiguous until the ninth century, when Rhazes (a Persian physician) outlined the criteria for differentiating between measles and smallpox (R\u0101z\u012b 1848). Rhazes discusses both ailments as immemorial, indicating that both diseases predated him by many generations. Although there are historical records of earlier plagues that could be interpreted as measles, notably in eighth century France during the battle of Tours (Rolleston 1937), it is also possible that this plague could have been smallpox or another disease with similar presentation. Even after Rhazes\u00d5 description, Western medicine still confounded measles, smallpox, and scarlet fever until the 17th century (Rolleston 1937). In light of this confusion, the lack of a definitive description of measles before Rhazes (e.g., Galen, an ancient Roman physician, described smallpox but not measles) does not establish that the virus was absent (McNeill 1976). It is plausible that MeV might have not entered the human population until the first millennium of the Common Era, as our analysis suggests. Alternatively, MeV could have emerged thousands of years ago, and the evolutionary models employed here are too crude to recover the true age of the virus. Regardless of which scenario is correct, accounting for variable selective pressures is an important step in revealing the ancient history of RNA viruses.",

            "text": "The different timescales affecting mutation rates and substitution rates make it difficult to extrapolate population-based estimates of rates over a long evolutionary time (Ho et al. 2005); however, it is unlikely that purifying selection alone can account for this difference between short- and long-term evolutionary rates (Woodhams 2006). Furthermore, short-term estimates of viral substitution rates (inferred from population-based rate estimates at the tips of phylogenies) are often found to be several orders of magnitude faster than long-term estimates of substitution rates (inferred from external calibrations located deeper in the phylogeny). This inconsistency has been reported for hepatitis B virus (Zhou and Holmes 2007, Gilbert and Feschotte 2010) and simian immunodeficiency virus (Wertheim and Worobey 2009a, Worobey et al. 2010), suggesting that long-term substitution rates can be orders of magnitude lower than short-term substitution rates. An alternative, and more parsimonious, explanation is that a single substitution rate (albeit one possibly slower than that inferred using short-term population-based data) predominates throughout the history of these viruses. And our inability to accurately estimate branch lengths creates the appearance of dramatically lower substitution rates deep in the phylogenetic tree. Although the methods presented here do not correct for branch lengths on the order needed to reconcile short-term substitution rates with deep calibrations, they provide a glimpse at the missing evolution that most current methods of phylogenetic inference fail to capture.",

            "text": "Although we are unable to provide a full remedy to the problem of underestimated branch lengths due to purifying selection, our results do point to a couple of guidelines when inferring tMRCAs in RNA viruses. First, the inference of substantially different selective regimes on longer internal branches compared with shorter shallower branches (e.g., using Lineage+Dual, Kosakovsky et al. 2005, or Free Ratio, Yang 1998, codon models) appears to be a sign that older tMRCAs may be underestimated. Second, if the synonymous substitution rate approaches saturation along a branch or group of branches, it is likely that the tMRCA cannot be reliably inferred. If either of these patterns is encountered, the inferred tMRCA estimates should be interpreted with caution. Rapid advances in cheap and accessible computational power will undoubtedly move the fields of paleovirology and molecular dating towards increasingly more realistic evolutionary models that account for variation in selective regimes (Suchard and Rambaut 2009). Our results provide compelling evidence that such a movement should be accelerated.",
