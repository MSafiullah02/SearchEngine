[24] [25] [26] So far, one study has reported lung immunopathology following MERS-CoV challenge in mice immunised with an inactivated MERS-CoV candidate vaccine. 27 However, in preclinical studies of ChAdOx1 immunisation and MERS-CoV challenge, no antibody-dependent enhancement was observed in transgenic mice expressing human DPP4, dromedary camels, or non-human primates. 14, 15, 28 The vaccine was immunogenic at all doses, inducing seroconversion in the majority of participants and T-cell responses in all, with responses demonstrating good durability up to 1 year after vaccination. Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking 14 days after vaccination and antibodies at 28 days. A small number of participants had positive antibody or T-cell responses (but never both) before vaccination. These pre-exisiting responses are likely to be due to crossreactivity with other known human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43, all of which circulate worldwide and can cause lower respiratory tract infections. 9 The prevalence of seropositivity to these four viruses in the UK is unknown, but a cross-sectional survey in the Netherlands found that 100% of children had sero converted to at least one of these by the age of 10 years, and it is likely that the rate is similar in the UK. 29 With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, preexisting cross-reactive immune responses to human coronaviruses is likely to be an area of further investigation.

Between 71% and 79% of all participants produced neutralising antibodies in assays using pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the spike glyco protein from three different strains of MERS-CoV.
