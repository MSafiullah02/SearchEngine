Four serotypes are known, but most epidemiological and clinical research has been focused on parainfluenza serotypes 1\u20133. This has been primarily due to the poor growth characteristics in cell culture of parainfluenza 4 (PIV4), the lack of commercial diagnostic reagents, and historical exclusion from routine diagnostic testing [3]. Two antigenically distinct PIV4 subtypes, PIV4a and PIV4b, exist [6]. Functionally and epidemiologically, little is known about the two PIV4 subtypes, however both are capable of co-circulating within the same population [7]. With the advent of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), it has become easier to screen for an expanded range of RNA viruses, leading to a re-examination of PIV4\u2019s epidemiology and role in human disease [2,3,5,8]. The majority of research into PIV4 has focused on children within the hospital setting, however little information is available on the role of PIV4 in disease within the broader community.",

Thus it is not surprising that four of the six evaluated published PCR assays contained potentially deleterious mismatches with the isolate. In particular, all four assays contain mismatches at or near their primers\u2019 3\u2032 ends, which are especially sensitive to incorrect base pairing and would potentially lead to decreased primer binding efficiency, and in conjunction with the other primer mismatches, false negative results. These mismatches illustrate the difficulty in designing sensitive PCR assays based on very limited sequence information. Additionally, the use of commercial assays for which primer sequences are not readily available, such as those used in recent PIV4 epidemiological studies [1,8], should be used with the understanding that there is no capacity to evaluate the assays\u2019 target sequence conservation as new data on emerging variant viral strains becomes available.",
