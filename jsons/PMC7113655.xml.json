            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae, and family Paramyxoviridae. The approximately 15.2 kb genome of HRSV contains 10 genes that encode 11 proteins (Collins and Melero, 2011). There are two distinct groups (A and B) of HRSV, which are distinguished by antigenic and genetic variation (Mufson et al., 1985, Cane and Pringle, 1991). These groups can be further subdivided into 11 A and 20 B genotypes (Arnott et al., 2011, Eshaghi et al., 2012). HRSV is the single most important viral cause of acute respiratory tract infections in children (Simoes, 1999). Approximately 90% of infants are infected by HRSV one or more times within 2 years of age, and the rate of hospitalization for primary infection is approximately 0.5% (Karron et al., 1999). The morbidity and mortality of HRSV are most significant in young children, the elderly and people who are immunocompromised or suffer from cardiopulmonary diseases (Hall et al., 1986, Falsey et al., 2005). In a report from the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, China, HRSV was responsible for 38.14% of the hospitalizations of children under the age of 14 (Zhang et al., 2010a). The mean cost of each HRSV-related hospitalization is US $571.80, which is a heavy burden for the average family in a developing country (Zhang et al., 2013). Severe diseases associated with lower respiratory tract HRSV infection are considered to have long-term impacts on individual health, including higher risk of asthma or wheezing and lower forced expiratory volume (Stein et al., 1999, Everard, 2006). Rapid diagnosis could enable medical intervention at the early stage of HRSV infection, thereby providing an effective means by which to reduce treatment costs and prevent long-term lung damage. Thus, fast and accurate diagnosis of HRSV infection is necessary for the surveillance and control of HRSV epidemics.",

            "text": "Several methods, such as virus isolation, antibody-based tests and molecular tests, have been developed since the discovery of HRSV. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a simpler and faster pathogen diagnostic method compared to these other methods. LAMP was first reported in 2000 (Notomi et al., 2000). This method employed three pairs of primers to efficiently amplify targets under isothermal conditions within 1 h. The amplification efficiency of LAMP is reported to be higher than PCR (Nagamine et al., 2002). The products of LAMP could be detected by visual observation of turbidity or changes in the color of calcein. Furthermore, the amplification plots of LAMP can also be obtained using a real-time turbidity monitor or fluorescence-detecting PCR instrument (Mori et al., 2001, Tomita et al., 2008). In combination with reverse transcriptase, LAMP is also able to detect RNA templates (Li et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012). Its sensitivity is comparable to RT-PCR, and the reaction can be completed within 1 h (Hong et al., 2004, Parida et al., 2004). LAMP is conducted under isothermal conditions, thus a water bath or heat block can easily maintain the temperatures needed for LAMP (Savan et al., 2005). Therefore, LAMP can be widely used for the diagnosis of various pathogens, especially in resource-limited settings (Haridas et al., 2010, Li et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012).",

In these studies, the primer sets for HRSV groups A and B were all located in the same region. In addition, a limited number of HRSV genome sequences were used to design the primers, which may limit the ability of RT-LAMP to detect all HRSV genotypes. In the present study, 39 group A and 10 group B HRSV complete genome sequences, which do not contain degenerate nucleotides, were downloaded from GenBank. These sequences were aligned by Muscle in MEGA v5.05 (Tamura et al., 2011). Conserved regions in the A and B groups were identified by searching the entropy plot using BioEdit v7.1.3 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) and verified by a whole genome searching strategy, which searched for the region with the most invariable sites in the consensus multiple alignment (Text S1). It was observed in the whole genome search that HRSV A and B groups do not share the same conserved region. Therefore, group A- and B-specific primer sets were designed in different parts of the HRSV genome.",

To obtain optimal RT-LAMP reaction conditions for these primer sets, an orthogonal experiment was used to optimize reagent concentrations and reaction temperatures, as previously reported (Cobb and Clarkson, 1994). Briefly, four optimizing factors were fixed at three different levels (Table 2\n). These levels were combined into nine sets according to the orthogonal table (Table 3\n). These nine reactions were carried out using a SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and fluorescent emissions between 565 and 590 nm were collected. Amplification curves were plotted (Fig. 1A). After calculating the mean positive time for each level of each factor, the optimal levels of the four factors were determined and the combination of the optimal level of each factor is listed in Table 4\n.",

Calcein is a fluorescent metal indicator that emits green fluorescence when conjugated with divalent metal ions and the fluorescent intensity corresponds to the degree of amplification (Tomita et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 2\n, the negative reaction mixture remained orange, while positive reactions turned green. Each reaction result was read by three individuals to confirm the color change. For real-time monitoring, reaction mixtures containing 15 \u03bcM calcein were incubated in a SmartCycler (Cepheid) at 60 \u00b0C for 60 min, and the emission fluorescence with wavelengths between 565 and 590 nm was collected and reaction curves were plotted. When fluorescence, relative to that at the start of each assay, had risen from 10 to 100 within 5 min, the reaction was considered positive. The relative fluorescence values of positive results were between 700 and 1600 when the amplification process reached the plateau stage, and a logarithmic increase of the relative fluorescence was observed in all positive results. Real-time detection of HRSV using calcein was more sensitive than detection by the naked eye. Other dyes, such as SYTO-9, are compatible with a real-time fluorometer, but they cannot be observed visually (Njiru et al., 2008, Mahony et al., 2013).",
