Human astroviruses are recognized as the second leading cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Eight traditional astrovirus serotypes have been identi fi ed in humans, but recently novel astrovirus strains isolated from humans have been associated with diseases other than gastroenteritis. Herein we summarize our current knowledge of the astrovirus life cycle. Though there are gaps in our understanding of astrovirus replication, similarities can be drawn from Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae virus families. There are, however, unique characteristics of the astrovirus life cycle, including intracellular proteolytic processing of viral particles by cellular caspases, which has been shown to be required for the maturation and exit of viral progeny.",

Ef fi cient propagation of astrovirus strains from both human and animal origin in cultured cells has permitted advances in the characterization of their life cycle ( Fig. 2.1 ). After astrovirus cell entry, the genomic RNA is uncoated and is then translated into a polyprotein precursor that is subsequently cleaved into the proteins required for replication of the virus genome and assembly of progeny viruses. These processes most likely take place in association with cellular membranes, and completion of the virus life cycle requires the action of caspases for the virus particles to exit the cell.",

The viral genome contains 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 untranslated regions (UTR) and three open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 2.2 ). The two ORFs located toward the 5 \u00a2 -end of the genome, designated ORF1a and ORF1b, encode nonstructural proteins that are presumed to be involved in RNA transcription and replication based on the sequence motifs they contain. The third ORF, found at the 3 \u00a2 -end of the genome, designated ORF2, is common to both the genomic and subgenomic RNAs and encodes the capsid proteins [ 50, 76 ] . An additional ORF (ORF-X) of 91-122 codons, contained within ORF2 in a +1 reading frame, has been described in all HAstV and some other mammalian viruses ( Fig. 2. 2 ) [ 18 ] . Its initiation codon is located 41-50 nucleotides downstream the ORF2 AUG and might be translated through a leaky scanning mechanism. It remains to be determined whether the putative protein encoded in ORF-X is synthesized in HAstV-infected cells and its signi fi cance for virus replication.",

            "text": "A comparison of the complete genome sequences of astrovirus strains reported thus far has recognized common features. An overlap of 10-148 nt in the genome of mammalian viruses has been found between ORF1a and ORF1b. These two ORFs also overlap in avian viruses, but this overlapping is only 12-45 nt long [ 54 ] . The overlapping region contains signals that are essential for translation of the viral RNA polymerase encoded in ORF1b through a frameshift mechanism. During infection of susceptible cells, two positive-sense RNA species have been observed: the fulllength genomic RNA (gRNA), and a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA, of ~2.4 kb) [ 38, 49 ] . contains three recognized open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2). ORF-X has been proposed as functional, given its conservation among astrovirus The genome contains three elements conserved among all members of the family: the frameshift signal ( blue square ), the sequence upstream ORF2 that putatively acts as promoter for synthesis of the subgenomic (sg) RNA, and the stem-loop at the 3 \u00a2 -end. Also shown are the insertion/deletion (In/del) region ( red square ) and the presence of a poly(A) tail at the 3 \u00a2 -end. A putative VPg protein is depicted as bound to the 5 \u00a2 -end of the genomic and subgenomic RNAs Both RNAs are transcribed from the negative-sense full-length complement of the genomic RNA. Based on the transcription initiation site determined for the sgRNA in HAstV-1 and HAstV-2 [ 50, 76 ] , ORF1b and ORF2 overlap by 8 nt; however, the length of this overlapping may vary, and it is not present in a duck astrovirus, in which it is 24 nt apart [ 19 ] . The synthesis of sgRNA requires an internal subgenomic promoter in the negative-sense RNA, and a highly conserved sequence in mammalian astroviruses around the ORF2 start codon that has been suggested to be part of the promoter for synthesis of the sgRNA [ 36 ] . This sequence is also conserved in avian astroviruses, but is slightly different in sequence and length [ 54 ] . This conserved sequence has a partial identity with the 5 \u00a2 -end of the gRNA [ 36 ] , suggesting it has an important role for the synthesis of both gRNA and sgRNA. A short 5 \u00a2 UTR between 11 and 85 nt long precedes ORF1a. Also, an 80-85-nt long 3 \u00a2 UTR is found between ORF2 and the poly(A) tail of HAstV genomes, but this sequence can be longer (130-305 nt) in avian astroviruses [ 68 ] . Of note, in addition to the 3 \u00a2 UTR, the terminal 19 nt of ORF2 are also highly conserved among HAstV serotypes [ 48 ] , and similarities have been observed in the sequence and folding of the 3 \u00a2 UTR of several animal astroviruses, as well as in avian infectious bronchitis virus (a coronavirus), a dog norovirus, and the equine rhinovirus serotype 2 [ 36 ] . These conserved sequences are thought to be important for interaction with the viral RNA replicase and with cellular proteins that are likely needed for replication of the viral genome.",

The crystal structure (2.0 \u00c5 resolution) of the predicted protease from a HAstV strain revealed a similarity with viral serine proteases from Sesbania mosaic virus and various picornaviruses (human rhinovirus 2, hepatitis A virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus).

Its synthesis in astrovirus-infected cells has not been investigated; however, similar to calicivirus, treatment of the viral genomic RNA with proteases markedly reduced the yield of infectious virus when the astrovirus genome was transfected into permissive cells, suggesting that the ability of the astrovirus genome to initiate a replication cycle depends on the presence of a genome-linked protein [ 31, 70 ] . A hypervariable region with deletions and insertions downstream the VPg motif has been related to adaptation of the virus to culture cells [ 73 ] and to ef fi cient synthesis of viral RNA during infection [ 30 ] . However, the form in which this region might modulate these events is unknown. The role in viral replication of the C-terminal region of nsp1a, comprising from aa residue 568 to the C terminus of the protein has been analyzed. This region, named nsp1a/4 [ 29 ] , includes the putative VPg protein and the hypervariable region, and was found to be phosphorylated and to form oligomers. Nsp1a/4 interacts with the RNA polymerase when translated in vitro, and this interaction depends on the phosphorylation status of the protein. The fact that the proposed phosphorylation site is in the putative VPg region supports the idea that nsp1a/4 could be implicated in the replication of the astrovirus genome [ 20 ] . In addition, nsp1a/4 has a perinuclear distribution near the endoplasmic reticulum and colocalizes with viral RNA [ 29 ] . Whether the region of nsp1a/4 that interacts with the replicase is equivalent to the predicted VPg protein remains to be determined.",

It varies from 672 to 851 aa in length, and, in general, the ORF2 of avian viruses codes for shorter polyproteins (Table 2 .4 ). The N-terminal half of the polyprotein is more conserved than the C-terminal domain, with the N-terminal region encompassing a region of basic amino acids that is conserved among astrovirus [ 35, 72 ] and is thought to interact with the genomic RNA in the virion [ 23 ] . The C-terminal half of the protein shows considerable sequence variability among astroviruses isolated from different animal species, or even among different isolates from the same species (Fig. 2.4 ) as it contains a delimited region with abundant Features of structural proteins. The primary ORF2 product (named VP90 in HAstV-8) contains two domains that can be distinguished by their degree of conservation: the N-terminal domain is highly conserved and forms the core of the capsid, while the hypervariable C-terminal domain forms the spikes of the virus particle. VP90 contains basic and acidic regions that are highly conserved among all astroviruses. VP90, the primary product of ORF2 is sequentially processed at its carboxy terminus by caspases to generate VP70 (intermediate cleavage products are shown in gray ), the protein present in the extracellular virions. These particles are processed by trypsin to generate protein intermediates of variable size (in gray ), and the fi nal products VP34, VP27, and VP25. Closed arrow heads represent cleavages carried out by caspases, important for virus maturation and cell egress ; open long arrow heads , cleavages by trypsin. The cleavage sites indicated by dashed arrow heads have not been precisely determined; therefore, the carboxy termini of the intermediate and fi nal products are unknown insertion or deletions [ 72 ] . The carboxy terminus of the polyprotein has an acidic character (residues 649-702 for HAstV-8) that is proposed to be highly conserved among all members of the Astroviridae family ( Fig. 2.4 ) [ 54 ] and is the substrate of cellular caspases. The last fi ve amino acid residues at the C-terminal end are also conserved among human and other mammalian virus strains. The conserved N-terminal domain of the structural protein forms the capsid core of the particle, whereas the hypervariable C-terminal domain forms the spikes of the virion. Thus, this last domain is predicted to participate in the early interactions of the virus with the host cell [ 16, 40 ] .",

The cellular receptor is unknown; however, the observation that different HAstV serotypes show different tropism in cultured cells [ 7 ] suggests that more than one cellular attachment or receptor molecule may be used by these viruses. Caco-2 cells are susceptible to infection by all HAstV serotypes, but HTC-15, another colon carcinoma cell line, only weakly supports infection by HAstV-1 [ 7 ] . Likewise, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells only permit the sustained passage of HAstV-2, but they are permissive for replication of other HAstV serotypes after transfection of in vitro transcribed genomic RNA [ 21 ] , suggesting that the blockage is at the virus entry level. It has been found that HAstV-8 binds to the surface of Caco-2 cells with a half-time of about 9 min (M\u00e9ndez et al., unpublished), and it is known that the infectivity of HAstV is greatly enhanced (3-5 logs) by, and probably is dependent on, trypsin cleavage of the capsid protein [ 4, 55, 61 ] . Although the trypsin cleavage products have been characterized (see below), the mechanism by which this treatment enhances virus infectivity is unknown. Trypsin cleavage of the precursor polyprotein produces in HAstV-8 three fi nal products, VP34, VP25, and VP27 [ 55 ] , with the concomitant induction of drastic structural changes in the particles [ 4 ] . VP34 represents the conserved domain and forms the capsid core, while both VP25 and VP27 form the spikes on the virion surface. The crystal structure of the HAstV-8 spike domain was recently solved at a 1.8 \u00c5 resolution [ 16 ] , mapping conserved residues onto the astrovirus projection domain revealed a putative receptor binding site with amino acid compositions characteristic for polysaccharide recognition [ 16 ] . Antibodies that recognize the spike proteins VP25 and VP27 are serotype speci fi c and neutralize virus infectivity [ 5, 61 ] , probably by blocking virus binding.",

Recently, a clathrin-dependent endocytosis was con fi rmed to be a functional pathway for the entry of HAstV-8 into Caco-2 cells. Drugs that affect clathrin assembly, endosome acidi fi cation, and actin fi laments, as well as those that decrease cellular cholesterol and interfere with vesicular transport, reduced the infectivity of HAstV-8.

Although the mechanism for this activation is unknown, it was independent of virus replication, suggesting that this pathway is triggered during virus binding or entry into the cell [ 51 ] . ERK1/2 seems to be required at early times to establish a productive infection, since inhibitors of this kinase blocked synthesis of viral proteins and RNA, and, consequently, reduced the virus yield. It has also been shown that astrovirus increases barrier permeability in polarized monolayers of Caco-2 cells following apical infection [ 52 ] . Permeability was increased when monolayers were treated not only with infectious virus, but also with inactivated virus or puri fi ed virus-like particles (VLPs), indicating that astrovirus-induced permeability occurs independently of viral replication and is modulated by the capsid protein. It has been suggested that HAstV could trigger tight junction instability to reach putative receptors present in the basolateral membrane; however, the fact that the increase in permeability is observed at least 16 h postinfection suggests that more than a requirement for virus entry, it is a consequence of the cellular signal transduction pathways induced by the virus.",

It has been suggested that the astrovirus genome contains a VPg 5 \u00a2 moiety in place of a traditional 7-methyl cap, and, as observed for caliciviruses, it could recruit the cap binding protein eIF4E to initiate translation [ 2, 10, 70 ] . The VPg protein from calicivirus has been shown to directly interact with eIF4E and eIF3, a multi-subunit scaffolding initiation factor, to promote assembly of the preinitiation complex [ 13, 25 ] . This VPg-eIF4E interaction may be a preferential method of viral over host translation [ 60 ] .",

This protein assembles into viral particles and is then cleaved at the carboxy terminus by cellular caspases to produce a 70-kDa protein (VP70) through several intermediate cleavage events (Fig. 2.4 ) [ 55 ] . The VP90 to VP70 cleavage is associated with the exit of the virus from the cell. A 90 kDa protein in HAstV-1 infected cells has also been detected [ 49, 70 ] . The intracellular cleavage of the primary translation product of ORF2 still requires further investigation; however, it seems clear that extracellular virions are only constituted by VP70 [ 55 ] . These virions require trypsin treatment to fully activate their infectivity. The proteolytic treatment cleaves VP70 into three smaller products and enhances virus infectivity up to 105-fold [ 4, 42 ] . The trypsin cleavage pathway of VP70 has been best characterized for HAstV-8 ( Fig. 2.4 ) and yields cleavage products of 25, 27, and 34 kDa. The cleavage products are similar in other astrovirus strains studied, although their sizes range from 24 to 26, 27 to 29, and 32 to 34 kDa [ 4, 6, 12, 23, 55 ] . Of interest, if intracellular viral particles formed by VP90 are isolated and treated with trypsin in vitro they also become infectious [ 53 ] .",

Few details are known about astrovirus, but the available information is consistent with previous studies in other positive-sense RNA viruses, making it reasonable to assume that replication of the astrovirus genome occurs in a similar manner. Based on this premise, it is thought that after translation of the gRNA and proteolytic processing of the nonstructural proteins a viral replicase complex is formed, which uses the gRNA to produce a full-length negative-sense RNA. This negative-sense RNA is detected 6-12 h postinfection, and it accumulates to 0.7-4% of gRNA [ 33 ] . The replicase complex of positive-sense RNA viruses usually contains the viral RdRp and other nonstructural proteins, as well as host proteins necessary for replication of the viral genome. In the case of astrovirus, the nonstructural protein nsp1a/4 protein (corresponding to the C-terminal end of nsp1a) has been shown to be required for virus replication in addition to the viral polymerase [ 20, 30 ] . Also, a predicted VPg has been suggested as a possible product of nsp1a [ 2 ] , opening the possibility that astrovirus RNA synthesis could be primer dependent. However, further studies are required to con fi rm this hypothesis. Whether the nonstructural proteins other than nsp1a/4 are required for astrovirus genome replication is unknown. Transcription of gRNA and sgRNA from an internal promoter of the full-length negative-sense RNA is detected starting at 8 h postinfection [ 54 ] . Requirements for the replicase complex to switch from minus-strand synthesis to positive-sense and sgRNA synthesis are unknown, but could pattern alphaviruses, which use nonstructural polyprotein processing to direct template activities [ 65 ] .",

Delayed structural protein synthesis and transcription of large amounts of sgRNA is a common theme in positive-sense RNA viruses and has been suggested to be a mechanism to overcome host translational repression, and possibly to promote packaging into virions of the newly synthesized viral genomes through inhibiting their translation [ 66 ] . The genome of HAstV contains highly conserved 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 UTRs [ 48 ] . UTRs from other viruses have been shown to facilitate 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 interactions during gRNA replication, recruit host factors for replication, are sites of recognition and initiation by the viral polymerase, and enhance the stability of the RNA genome. It is likely that astrovirus UTRs play a similar role in the virus gRNA replication, although this remains to be determined [ 45, 59, 64, 69, 71 ] . Very little information is available regarding speci fi c host proteins involved in replication of the astrovirus genome, although this process could require several RNA binding proteins, as reported for other plus-strand RNA viruses [ 1, 8, 11 ] .",

In vitro transcribed RNA from a full-length cDNA clone of the HAstV-1 genome has also proved to be infectious [ 21 ] . Using this clone, a reverse genetics system for HAstV-1 was established and used to analyze speci fi c mutations in the structural [ 23 ] and nonstructural proteins [ 30 ] . This system consists of the in vitro transcribed RNA, which is transfected into the highly transfectable, but nonsusceptible and poorly permissive BHK-21 cells, harvesting the virus produced, and propagating this virus in the astrovirus-susceptible Caco-2 cell line. This protocol, although ef fi cient in terms of virus yield after ampli fi cation in Caco-2 cells, has the drawback that the mutant virus is fi nally obtained after several rounds of replication in the latter cells, which might induce accumulation of additional mutations in the viral progeny. Thus, analysis of the phenotype associated with speci fi c mutations introduced in the cDNA clone may be disguised. In fact, viruses with changes not related to the mutations originally introduced in the nonstructural region of HAstV-1 were found after virus recovery by this method [ 30 ] . More recently, a protocol that improves the reverse genetics system of astrovirus has been described [ 70 ] . It uses the highly transfectable and HAstV-susceptible and highly permissive hepatocyte cell line Huh7.5.1 making it possible to obtain higher titer virus yield in a single replication cycle, decreasing the frequency of potentially undesired mutations [ 70 ] .",

When the VLPs assembled in insect cells were further characterized by ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, the particles banded at a density of 1.08 g/ml, and electron microscopy analysis showed the presence in this fraction of VLPs around 38 nm in diameter, similar to HAstV-1 puri fi ed particles, as well as ring-like structures of 16 nm in diameter [ 9 ] . Of interest, these ring-like structures could be converted into VLPs in the presence of Mg 2+ , while sequestration of divalent cations promoted the disassembly of VLPs into ring-like structures [ 9 ] . These observations showed the importance of divalent ions to maintain the capsid structure and suggest that the ring-like structures could be directly involved in VLP morphogenesis.

Analysis of HAstV-8infected cells by density ultracentrifugation showed that intracellular viral particles consisting of VP90 were present in association with membranes as well as in membrane-free fractions [ 53 ] . Based on these and related fi ndings [ 3 ] , a model was proposed in which the viral progeny assemble in membranous structures, and then dissociate from the membranes by an unknown mechanism; once in a membranefree environment the assembled VP90 is then proteolytically cleaved at the C-terminal end to yield viral particles containing VP70 (Fig. 2.6 ). This cleavage is blocked by caspase inhibitors and induced by TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis ligand), suggesting an active role of caspases in the process [ 57 ] , although it is not clear if VP90 processing occurs intracellularly or concomitantly with cell egress of the virus . The involvement of caspases in this process is supported by the presence of an acidic region in the C-terminal region of VP90, conserved in astroviruses, that contains several putative caspases recognition motifs [ 57 ] .",

The cleavage of PARP occurred at 12 h postinfection, in coincidence with the cleavage of VP90 to VP70 [ 3, 57 ] . Furthermore, executioner caspases-3/7, as well as initiator caspases-4, -8, and -9, were all activated at 12 h postinfection [ 3 ] as determined by the cleavage of preferential substrates of these caspases [ 3 ] . In addition, the precursor forms of all evaluated caspases were processed in these cells, con fi rming their active status, and suggesting that more than one caspase is active during astrovirus infection [ 3 ] . In contrast with these results, neither the apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial pathway nor caspase-9 was activated in HAstV-4-infected Caco-2 cells, although the processed product of pro-caspase-8 was detected, suggesting its activation [ 28 ] . [ 53 ] Although several caspases become active in astrovirus-infected cells, it is not clear which of these proteases mediate the VP90-VP70 cleavage. Knocking down the activity of caspases by RNA interference showed that caspases-3, -4, and -9, but not caspase-8, are involved in this process in infected cells [ 3 ] . In vitro translation of truncated forms of HAstV-8 VP90 suggests that the caspase motif TYVD 657 , in the C-terminal acid region of VP90, is the most likely to be cleaved to yield VP70, although cleavages at motifs DEVD 666 and EETD 672 could generate the 75 to 82 kDa processing intermediate products of VP90 that have been observed in infected cells (Fig. 2.4 ) [ 3, 54 ] . In agreement with this observation, the recently reported crystallographic structure of the HAstV-8 capsid spike suggested that the aspartic acid residue at position 657 should be accessible to caspases in intact particles [ 16 ] .",

The cell expression of ORF1a has also been reported to induce apoptosis [ 29 ] ; whether this effect is connected with the presence of the proposed death domain needs further investigation. Processing of viral proteins by caspases that result in the pro-or antiapoptotic activities of the processed viral polypeptides has been reported for other viruses such as in fl uenza A and B [ 78 ] , hepatitis C [ 62 ] , and coronavirus [ 17 ] .

Caspase activation does not always result in cell death or secondary necrosis and the activation level of these proteases and their interaction with cellular proteins modulate cell death progression [ 41 ] . The requirement of VP90 processing by caspases for virus exit has been con fi rmed through the use of caspase inhibitors. A potent inhibitor for executioner caspases-3/7, Ac-DEVD-CHO, blocked virus release at levels similar to those induced by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. On the other hand, inhibitors of initiator caspases-8 and -9 had no effect on virus egress [ 3 ] . Thus, although VP90 can be cleaved in astrovirus-infected cells by caspases-3 and -9, as described earlier, virus exit seems to depend on the activity of caspases 3/7 but not of caspase-9, and most probably on the activity of caspase-3, since RNA interference of the expression of this caspase has a strong negative effect on virus release [ 3 ] .",

The release of nonenveloped viruses, such as astrovirus, is generally believed to occur by cell membrane destabilization. However, rotavirus and poliovirus exit the cells through a nonlytic mechanism, and in the later case, probably through autophagic vesicles [ 32 ] . Thus, intracellular transport of astrovirus particles could be important for cell exit. It has not been determined whether autophagy is induced during astrovirus infection, although double membrane vesicles have been observed in astrovirus-infected cells [ 26, 29 ] . Some astrovirus strains have been shown to cause cytopathic effect on cultured cells and necrosis of hepatic cells in natural infections [ 26 ] . It is unclear which astrovirus-cell interaction leads to virus egress via a lytic or nonlytic process.",

Identi fi cation of the cell receptors and the entry pathway used by astroviruses to infect susceptible cells in culture, but most importantly to infect the target cells in a natural infection, will be of utmost importance to understand the biology of these Fig. 2.7 Kinetics of infectious virus production. Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV-8, and at different time points (from 0 to 24 hpi) the extracellular and cell-associated fractions were analyzed for infectious viral particles. Virus in the extracellular ( empty circles ) and cell-associated ( fi lled circles ) fractions was determined after trypsin treatment [ 3 ] viruses and to control infection. Signi fi cant gaps exist in our understanding of the translation and replication of the viral genome; identi fi cation of viral and cellular proteins that participate in these processes will be fundamental to elucidate the mechanisms involved. The cell response to astrovirus infection has proved already to be bene fi cial for the early interactions of the virus with the cell, as well as for the last step of virus morphogenesis; however, genomic and proteomic approaches will be required to signi fi cantly advance our understanding of the virus-host cell interactions that lead to productive and ef fi cient infection.

The primary ORF2 product (named VP90 in HAstV-8) contains two domains that can be distinguished by their degree of conservation: the N-terminal domain is highly conserved and forms the core of the capsid, while the hypervariable C-terminal domain forms the spikes of the virus particle. VP90 contains basic and acidic regions that are highly conserved among all astroviruses. VP90, the primary product of ORF2 is sequentially processed at its carboxy terminus by caspases to generate VP70 (intermediate cleavage products are shown in gray ), the protein present in the extracellular virions. These particles are processed by trypsin to generate protein intermediates of variable size (in gray ), and the fi nal products VP34, VP27, and VP25. Closed arrow heads represent cleavages carried out by caspases, important for virus maturation and cell egress ; open long arrow heads , cleavages by trypsin. The cleavage sites indicated by dashed arrow heads have not been precisely determined; therefore, the carboxy termini of the intermediate and fi nal products are unknown",
