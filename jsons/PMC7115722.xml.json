A complex host-pathogen interaction then determines the clinical manifestations and outcomes of such acquisition.\u2022COPD predisposes to community-acquired pneumonia and alters its cause, treatment, and outcomes.\u2022Several lines of evidence now suggest that chronic airway infection by bacteria is prevalent in COPD, and by triggering a chronic inflammatory response contributes to progression of disease.\u2022Lung innate immune defenses are impaired in COPD, making these patients more susceptible to infection. Respiratory pathogens prevalent in COPD use various mechanisms to evade host responses and thereby cause acute and persistent infections.\n\n",

            "text": "The role of infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was first postulated in 1953 by Stuart-Harris and colleagues1 in what is now known as the British hypothesis. They speculated that the decline in the lung function in COPD was the result of mucus hypersecretion and recurrent bacterial infections. In the next 2 decades, several studies were performed to confirm the hypothesis. In some of these studies, sputum microbiology was used to compare the rate of bacterial infection in patients with chronic bronchitis at baseline and during exacerbations, as well as in comparison with individuals without COPD.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Some differences in bacterial infection related to disease state were found; for example, Smith and colleagues2, 3, 8 found increased colonization with Haemophilus influenzae in patients with severe COPD compared with mild COPD. However, for the most part, differences in the rate of bacterial isolation from sputum at stable state (ie, colonization) versus at acute exacerbation (ie, infection) were not seen in these studies. Advanced molecular biology techniques to differentiate bacterial strains within species had not been developed and were therefore not available to these investigators. Other investigators examined this hypothesis by using serologic studies to determine levels of antibacterial antibodies in patients with chronic bronchitis. These results were also confusing and contradictory and were confounded by the use of laboratory strains as an antigen (discussed in Ref.9). In 1977, Fletcher and colleagues10 published a landmark study that showed that frequency of exacerbations and mucus hypersecretion did not result in faster decline of lung function in patients with COPD. By the early 1980s, because of these observations and the appreciation of the importance of tobacco smoke in COPD pathogenesis, the British hypothesis was rejected, and bacterial infection was relegated to an epiphenomenon in this disease.7\n",

Understanding of viral exacerbations has recently been expanded by the use of molecular diagnostic techniques and with the development of a human experimental model of rhinoviral exacerbations. The most common viruses detected in airway secretions at exacerbation are rhinovirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, and adenovirus. A recent systematic review found that viruses were detected in 34.1% of exacerbations.12 More recent studies using molecular detection of virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have found viruses in up to half of all exacerbations.13 The human experimental model of rhinoviral exacerbations was described in a study in which 13 subjects with COPD and 13 control subjects were nasally inoculated with a low dose of rhinovirus.14 An increased neutrophilic inflammatory response in the lower airway, and more prominent lower respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction, were found in COPD compared with controls. An impaired interferon response to the infection was seen in patients with COPD. This work confirms the viral causation of exacerbations and has provided insights into susceptibility and pathogenic mechanisms involved in viral exacerbations.",

In a longitudinal prospective cohort study in patients with COPD, when bacterial strains in sputum were characterized by molecular techniques, combined with a careful analysis of host immune and immunologic responses, an important mechanism that likely underlies exacerbations caused by the 4 major pathogens listed earlier was found (Fig. 2\n).15 The risk of having an exacerbation was increased by more than 2-fold with respiratory tract acquisition of strains of these bacterial pathogens that were new to the patient. In this initial study, 33% of the visits within a month of new strain acquisition were associated with an exacerbation compared with 15.4% without a new strain.16 Subsequent analyses from this study have now shown that the incidence of exacerbations at a visit with a new strain isolated from sputum is 40% to 50%, and that this holds true for each of the 4 major pathogens (nontypeable H influenzae, S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis, and P aeruginosa).17, 18, 19 Additional support for this mechanism for exacerbations comes from various observations. Exacerbation-associated strains of H influenzae are more inflammatory in in vitro and animal models than strains associated with colonization, showing that clinical implications of bacterial acquisition correlate with strain virulence.20 Strain-specific host immune response and a vigorous neutrophilic inflammatory response distinguish new strain exacerbations from those without new strains.21\n",

Lower serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 levels were seen in the COPD group, suggesting an impaired inflammatory response in these patients.36, 37 Higher mortality with CAP in COPD has been observed in other studies, reiterating the importance of early recognition and appropriate management in this high-risk population.38, 39, 40\n",
