Also, the influence of meteorological parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity (RH) and mixing height on the distribution, dispersion and over all life time of atmospheric pollutants emitted during Diwali has been widely studied. However, except for Saha et al., 2014, very little study has been reported on the possible causes for the observed changes in meteorological parameters during Diwali.",

At higher temperatures, air expands and can therefore hold more water vapour, resulting in a decrease in RH (Shaman and Kohn, 2009). Although RH exhibits high natural variability throughout the year, any short term enhancement in humidity levels coupled with high level of pollutants during Diwali might prove to be fatal for a large number of elderly people and children with respiratory ailments. Therefore the influence of pollutants emitted during Diwali on meteorological parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity (RH) and in turn the effect of short term change in environmental parameters on the survival of viruses responsible for the transmission of viral infections such as common cold, as well as triggering immune-mediated illnesses such as asthma has been examined in this paper over a period of 13 years at three cities in India namely; Ahmedabad, New Delhi and Kolkata.",

Airborne infection involves the production of an infectious organism in one host to its transmission to a secondary host. Tang (2009) has observed that environmental exposure is a common hazard for these infectious organisms during their journey between hosts as temperature, humidity and sunlight (ultraviolet light) can act to inactivate these free-floating organisms. As temperature affects the state of viral proteins (including enzymes) and the virus genome (RNA or DNA), virus survival decreases with increase in temperature.",

Generally, viruses with lipid envelopes (respiratory viruses such as influenza, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses) tend to survive longer at 20\u201330% RH (Harper, 1961, Schaffer et al., 1976, Ijaz et al., 1985). Conversely, non-lipid enveloped viruses (such as respiratory adenoviruses and rhinoviruses) tend to survive longer at 70\u201390% RH (Karim et al., 1985, Arundel et al., 1986, Cox, 1989, Cox, 1998). Although the findings from all studies are not consistent, there seems to be some general indication that minimal survival for both lipid enveloped and non-lipid-enveloped viruses occurs at an intermediate RH of 40\u201370% (Arundel et al., 1986; Tang, 2009). Outside this range, viruses thrive and multiply.",

Kolkata (22.65\u00b0N; 88.44\u00b0E), the capital of West Bengal is located on the eastern bank of river Hooghly and is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India.

New Delhi (28.57\u00b0N; 77.12\u00b0E), the capital of India, lies on the flood plains of the river Yamuna on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It covers an area of 1484 km2 and has a population of around 27 million residents. It is a densely populated, cosmopolitan city and has one of the highest living standards in India. Diwali or Deepawali, also known as the \u201cFestival of Lights\u201d is one of the oldest, and most popular cultural and religious festival, which is celebrated throughout India every year during October/November with fervour and gaiety. In north India (New Delhi), Diwali signifies Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana and his coronation as king; in Gujarat (Ahmedabad), Diwali signifies worship of goddess Lakshmi and marks the beginning of New Year, while in West Bengal (Kolkata), it is associated with the worship of goddess Kali. The celebrations include lighting of lamps, candles and bursting of fireworks. The festive fever starts a few days prior to Diwali with people igniting fireworks, shopping for the celebrations and visiting each other and reaches a crescendo on the day of Diwali.",

The sulphate and suspended particulate matter released into the atmosphere during the ignition of fireworks contribute to the high levels of SO2 and PM10 (\u03bcg/m3) observed during Diwali compared to the background levels (Fig. 3). It is further observed from Fig. 4, that the SO2 and PM10 levels are high during the years 2007, 2010 and 2012 under study at New Delhi.
