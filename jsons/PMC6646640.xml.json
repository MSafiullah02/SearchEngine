The probability of finding a matched family donor is approximately 30%. Therefore, 70% patients require grafts from alternative donors. Matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT has been proven to be a feasible and efficacious alternative to matched family donors. However, MUD transplants carry several disadvantages such as the high cost of procuring stem cells and unreliability of the time required for such procurement. Haploidentical stem cell transplants (haplo SCT) from family donors have the advantage of easy availability of the donor and subsequent decrease in expense. Recent technological advances of T cell depletion have made this form of SCT accessible and feasible. In particular, post-transplant cyclophosphamide as a technique for in vivo T cell depletion, which is significantly less expensive as compared to in vitro T depletion techniques, has provided a ray of hope for several children with life-threatening conditions and conditions that impair quality of life. Data is scarce with regard to its efficacy and safety in children with benign disorders. We present our experience in offering haplo SCT for children with benign disorders and the associated challenges and lessons learnt.",
