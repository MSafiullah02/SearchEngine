Among such sensors with different working principles, nanomechanical sensors have attracted much attention because of their remarkable features; high sensitivity, wide target range from small molecules to macromolecules, compatibility with industrial technologies, and so on [1]. A number of biological species such as viruses, proteins, bacteria, and cells have been investigated by means of nanomechanical sensors [2].",

Since affinity of sensors to sensing targets is affected by the type of functional layers, so-called \u201creceptor layers,\u201d coated onto the sensor surface, it is important to properly design receptor layers depending on applications.

The major advantage of the static mode is that a cantilever is not affected by damping because the bending motion caused by the analyte-induced surface stress is slow enough, minimizing the damping in most cases. Since the damping of liquid media severely decreases the sensitivity in the dynamic mode, the static mode is a better option for measurements in a liquid environment. It does not require any complicated peripheral devices, such as actuators or high-frequency readout setups, which are usually necessary for dynamic mode measurements.\n",

Even for a model system of alkanethiols on a gold (111) surface, several explanations have been reported so far.

This shift is due to the change in effective mass induced by the adsorption of analytes on a cantilever. Since signals can be directly correlated to the basic property of adsorbates, that is, mass, the dynamic mode is a useful and powerful technique to derive quantitative information. As the sensitivity generally depends on the resonance frequency determined by the size of a cantilever, a nanometer scale cantilever operated at very high frequency bands (\u223c30\u223c300 MHz) marked several milestones, such as \u223c7 zeptogram (10\u201321 g) resolution (equivalent to \u223c30 xenon atoms) in a cryogenically cooled, ultrahigh vacuum (below 10\u201310 torr) apparatus [15], and the mass resolution less than 1 attogram (10\u201318 g) in air at room temperature [16].\n",

This equation is derived through pure mechanics, assuming the ideal condition. Thus, in practical situations, several issues still remain. One of the most important issues is the damping effect induced by the surrounding media, as briefly described in the previous section. The damping severely lowers the performance of a cantilever sensor in terms of a low quality factor Q, especially in a liquid environment where Q becomes one-tenth of that in air, resulting in low resolution to track the resonance frequency. Braun and Ghatkesar et al. proposed and demonstrated an elegant way to circumvent the damping effect in a liquid environment using higher flexural modes [17], [18], [19]. They succeeded in detecting protein\u2013ligand interactions in a physiological environment at a sensitivity of 2.5 pg/Hz [17], and demonstrated the significant improvement in quality factor of up to \u223c30 times with the 16th flexural mode [19].",

For multiple cantilevers such as a cantilever array, the same number of laser sources must be prepared. While highly integrated VCSEL or multiple optical fiber systems might be able to solve this problem, each laser light should be always aligned on each cantilever precisely. Thus, optical readout is not suitable for large one- or two-dimensional arrays. Another critical problem is the difficulty in measurements in opaque liquids, such as blood. In such a liquid, the optical signal is significantly attenuated owing to low transmission or refractive index change.",

In contrast to the optical readout method, no bulky and complex peripherals are required because a piezoresistive readout electrically measures the change in resistance of a piezoresistor with a simple circuit (Fig. 4.3.4\n). By means of the piezoresistive readout, it is also possible to perform measurements even in opaque liquids. In addition, because of its complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility, the whole sensor unit including readout parts can be integrated into common semiconductor devices, such as mobile phones. It is also technically feasible by mass production to produce inexpensive disposal chips, which are important for various applications, especially for medical diagnosis. Thus, the piezoresistive readout has been regarded as one of the most promising approaches to overcome the problems arising from the optical readout. In spite of these inherent advantages, piezoresistive cantilevers have not been widely utilized for sensing applications because of their critically low sensitivity. In other words, they will open the door to the applications of nanomechanical sensors if the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever can be significantly improved. Therefore, various trials have been made for more than a decade to improve the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever toward practical uses. However, significant improvement in sensitivity has not been achieved to make piezoresistive detection comparable to the optical approach.",

Figure 4.3.6\nshows the distribution of the output signals. In the case of the cantilever-based sensor, the distribution of the output signals had almost the same standard deviations as the surface stress. On the other hand, the standard deviations of the output signals dramatically decreased for the MSS; approximately 50 times smaller than the standard deviations of the surface stress. These results indicate that the MSS has a higher stability for the inhomogeneous surface stress compared to a cantilever-based sensor. As the inhomogeneous surface stress is mainly caused by the roughness of the receptor layers, these results suggest that the MSS is less influenced by the quality of the coatings, leading to the higher uniformity of the sensing performance. The results of the FEA simulations were also confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4.3.7\n). On the basis of the FEA simulation and the experimental results, the higher reproducibility of the MSS compared to a cantilever-based sensor was demonstrated; the output signal of the MSS is less influenced by the roughness of the receptor layer.

In contrast to the optical readout case, signals are obtained with a double-side-coated piezoresistive cantilever sensor [35], [36]. An in-plane elongation caused by the surface stresses on both sides can be detected by the piezoresistor embedded at the clamped end (Fig. 4.3.8d).
