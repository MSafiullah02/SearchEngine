With sufficient data, particle and ensemble filters can be utilized to further improve model accuracy [23] , [24] . In our case, COVID-19 is at an early stage of spreading in Kazakhstan.

The transportation connections between the regions can also be modeled as the edges of the network. Each node in the network runs concurrently as a separate instance of the single-node SEIR model described in Sec. III-A. The internal parameters of each SEIR model can be changed independently. The network model thus allows for viral propagation, with corresponding state transitions, within and amongst the nodes representing the cities and the regions.

We chose Lombardy since it is the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, its epidemic timeline is well-established, and the Italian government has shared comprehensive daily epidemic data since 24 February 2020 [34] , thus facilitating the calibration of model assumptions against actual events and data. The population of Lombardy is just over 10 million people, therefore, we used this number to initialize the number of susceptible individuals in our model. We started the simulation on 1 January 2020 based on the results presented in [35] . We set the number of exposed individuals to ten on this date, as this figure yielded accurate model state populations going forward. In order to tune other parameters of the model, we used the reported data for the Lombardy region for the period between 24 February and 27 April 2020. Also, we took into account the timeline of events and government policy decisions that would impact the simulation (see Table II ).",

Perhaps the single greatest factor is that most countries only test if a patient meets screening criteria, with explicit symptoms, but exposed patients can remain asymptomatic for approximately five days, and a non-trivial percentage of those infected may not seek medical care, due to light symptoms, and the infection may not be recognized or registered as COVID-19 due to sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests available on market [36] .",

Thus, if we run the simulator tightly, calibrating and updating based only on the reported confirmed case data, then we risk essentially modeling for those with severe enough symptoms that they require medical care, but by doing so the model will only capture a portion of the impact, and skew the population sizes for the Susceptible and Recovered states.
