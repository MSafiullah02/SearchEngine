Imperfect crystal balls fail to guide us with certainty. But looming in the background is the ever present threat of influenza, the only microbe that causes regular widespread epidemics around the world. Not so exotic and all too familiar \u2013 casually referred to as the \u201cflu\u201d \u2013 influenza is the virologist\u2019s Trojan horse, as it readily and rapidly mutates (drift), has the ability to swap genetic elements from influenza viruses with origins in other species (shift) and, as an RNA virus lacks repair and self-correcting mechanisms that are the basis of its genetic instability and makes it both dangerous and unpredictable. A reassortment leading to an extremely virulent and readily transmissible pandemic virus is inevitable.",

A pandemic can only be brought under control through a shift in the population from susceptibility to immunity. But as we learned in the 2009 influenza pandemic, although our response time has improved, a significant shift in approach is needed if an effective vaccine is to be in place before the next pandemic emerges. With that goal in mind, the science of influenza and of vaccine development needs to be looked at with fresh eyes [8]. The Holy Grail is an influenza vaccine that provides a broader and more durable immune response than the natural infection and that can provide population immunity to pandemic influenza viruses before they emerge. A number of efforts are now focused on developing such a \u201cuniversal\u201d influenza vaccine; however, the scientific challenges involved are enormous [9], [10]. Until such a universal influenza vaccine becomes available, global influenza vaccine production capacity needs to be ready to respond when the next pandemic emerges.",

Ultimately, the success of a vaccination programme will hinge not only on the technical aspects of its implementation, but on the demand for it among the population; this underscores the need to understand the factors that promote vaccine acceptance [11], [12].",

It is the implementation of these policies that will determine demand. Without a concomitant increase in global demand for seasonal influenza vaccine, the capacity that will produce the world\u2019s pandemic vaccines that GAP has stimulated cannot be sustained [18].",
