Although many other common organisms contribute to the clinical signs associated with PCVAD, PCV2 is the common link among the diseases and therefore it is vital to understand the biology of the virus for control of the disease. PCVAD is a globally emerging disease that is having a huge impact on swine-producing countries and is arguably the most economically important disease affecting the global swine industry today. The British Pig Executive national herd mortality data for finisher pigs in 2006 found that mortality increased from 3.3 to 6.5% when PCVAD began affecting herds. Fifty percent of affected farms had mortality rates over 9.7%. 1 PCV2 infection is present in every major swine-producing country in the world and the number of cases of PCVAD is rapidly increasing. In 1998, University of Guelph's Animal Health Laboratory reported a pathologic diagnosis of o20 cases. In contrast, 350 cases were reported in 2005 by the same laboratory and these numbers continue to increase. 2 In the United States, the disease has cost producers an average of 3-4 dollars per pig with peak losses ranging up to 20 dollars per pig.

Another genus in the circoviridae family, Gyrovirus, includes chicken anemia virus. 24 The Gyrovirus genus is distinct in that it has a negative sense genome and larger virions than is typical for circovirus. 25 Circoviruses are host specific, most of which are avian, or have a relatively narrow host range. Several species produce lymphoid depletion in infected hosts whereas others cause subclinical infection. 24 PCV1 is most closely related to the beak and feather disease virus. 26 Several human circoviruses also exist and include the torque teno virus (TTV), which is related to the swine TTV, TTV-like mini virus, and the SEN virus. The human circoviruses have not been definitively linked to any disease in humans. [27] [28] [29] [30] Circoviridae is most closely related to the family Nanoviridae, which includes plant viruses. These viruses share a step loop structure at the origin of replication and show similarities in the replication proteins. 31 These similarities are also shared by the plant Geminiviruses, and it is speculated that circovirus may be the genetic link between the 2 plant virus families. 26 It has been proposed that an ancestor of PCV1 may have been a plant nanovirus that infected a vertebrate host and recombined with a vertebrate-infecting RNA virus, which was most likely a calicivirus. 32 PCV2 has been divided into 2 distinct genotypes. They have been named PCV2-group 1 and PCV2-group 2. 4 There is no difference in pathogenesis between the 2 genotypes, but the viruses differ in size with PCV2-group 1 being 1,767 nucleotides (nt) and PCV2-group 2 being 1,768 nt. 4 PCV2-group 1 is further divided into 3 clades and PCV2-group 2 divided into 5 clades. 4 Historically, only PCV2-group 2 isolates were found in the United States; but in late 2005 several outbreaks of higher than normal mortality (5-50%) were reported in Kansas, North Carolina, and Iowa. These outbreaks were found to be associated with PCV2-group 1 isolates. 33 About the same time as PCV2 was being grouped into group 1 and group 2 isolates, North American laboratories proposed grouping PCV2 into North American isolates, or PCV2a, and European-like isolates, or PCV2b. 34 PCV2b falls into PCV2-group 1 and PCV2a falls into PCV2-group 2. 34 Genomic Organization PCV1 and PCV2 have a small, nonenveloped icosahedral virion 5 with a single-stranded, circular DNA genome of 1,759 nt and 1,767-1,768 nt in size, respectively. 3,31 They contain 2 major open reading frames (ORFs) encoded in an antisense direction 24 (Fig 1) . ORF1 encodes for viral replication proteins (Rep), and ORF2 encodes for the capsid protein (Cap), which contains the immunodominant antigenic epitopes. 31, [35] [36] [37] [38] ORF1 is very similar between PCV1 and PCV2 with 83% nucleotide and 86% amino acid identity between them. 39 ORF1 is alternatively spliced into 8 RNA strands in PCV1 and 5 RNA strands in PCV2. Only 2 RNA strands, Rep and Rep 0 , are essential for virus replication. 36, 40, 41 PCV1 and PCV2 share 67% nucleotide and 65% amino acid sequence identity in ORF2. 39 A 3rd ORF has been described in PCV2 and it has been suggested that ORF3 is involved with apoptosis, 42 but this report has not been able to be verified by independent laboratories.

It is believed that PCV2 uses a relatively common cell receptor, because viral replication and PCV2 antigen has been found in many different cell types. 44 PCV2 binds to heparin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), as a 1st step of attachment. 45 However, as PCV2 is found in cells that lack GAGs, it is thought that another coreceptor is also used for viral entry. 45 The hallmark lesion of PCV2 infection is lymphoid depletion with histiocytic replacement. In affected lymph organs, dendritic cells, and macrophages that replace the lymphocytes contain large amounts of PCV2 virus. 7, 46, 47 There is no viral degradation in these cells, and because dendritic cells are highly mobile, it is thought that dendritic mobility may be a method of viral dissemination in tissues. 48 It is still unknown how PCV2 causes a reduction in lymphocytes. Hypotheses include induced apoptosis, decreased lymphocyte production in the bone marrow, or reduced lymphocyte proliferation in secondary lymphoid tissue. 23 Because PCV2 encodes for only 2 major proteins, it is thought that the virus relies on its host cell for protein expression and for replication. The virus requires an actively replicating cell, specifically in the S-phase, 49 for DNA replication via a DNA polymerase. PCV2 replication is speculated to involve a rolling-circle method. 50, 51 It was determined in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells that the 1st detectable protein produced postinfection is the Cap protein, which was localized in the perinuclear area of the cell. 52 At 12 hours postinoculation, both Cap and Rep were detectable in the nucleus. By 36 hours postinoculation, the viral titer had stabilized indicating that the virus had completed replication. 52 There is currently no information on how the capsid is made, how the virus assembles or how it is released from infected cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 274, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 396, "end": 398, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 518, "end": 520, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 736, "end": 738, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 739, "end": 742, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 743, "end": 745, "text": "47", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 928, "end": 930, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1153, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1379, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1492, "text": "50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1495, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1680, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1874, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History of the Porcine Circovirus (PCV)"}, {"text": "PCV2 can be transmitted in several ways. The main route is by oro-nasal contact with infected feces, 13 contact with infected urine, or directly with infected pigs. 53, 54 PCV2 is shed in respiratory secretions, oral secretions, urinary secretions, and feces in both clinically affected as well as in infected but apparently healthy pigs. Clinically affected pigs shed virus in higher quantity compared with infected but clinically healthy pigs. 55 PCV2 can also be transmitted vertically (from the sow to the piglets) through the placenta causing persistently infected piglets at birth, but this method of transmission appears to be rare. [56] [57] [58] [59] PCV2 has also been shown to be shed in colostrums, 60 but whether this can result in an infection is still being investigated. Recent work has shown that PCV2infected pork products (lymphoid tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone marrow), when fed to naive piglets for 3 days, resulted in viremia and seroconversion to PCV2 in all of the piglets. 61 PCV2 is also shed in semen and in experimental studies seminal virus shedding was detected as early as 5 days postinoculation. [62] [63] [64] Shedding in naturally infected boars appears to be low and sporadic. 62 The greatest amount of virus appears in the seminal fluid and nonsperm fraction. 65 Boars that are persistently infected may continue to shed the virus in semen and semen samples were found to be positive in boars up to 71 weeks of age. Samples collected from boars ranging from 71 to 149 weeks of age were not found to shed virus in semen. 62 The virus did not appear to affect the percentages of live and morphologically normal sperm. 62 Recent evidence has shown that PCV2 virus present in the semen is infectious when injected IP into pigs, but failed to seroconvert gilts that were artificially inseminated.

IHC is also cheaper to run and has a faster turn around time. However, many labs do not offer IHC, because one of the required reagents is anti-PCV2 antiserum. Although a monoclonal anti-PCV2 is commercially available, definitive diagnosis can still be difficult with that product. The best way to diagnose PCVAD is the identification of the characteristic lesions of the disease.

To identify and manage outbreaks of PCV2 and PCVAD diseases within a herd, it is important to determine whether the disease is a significant herd problem or is only sporadically causing a herd problem.

An important herd problem has been defined as an increase in mortality of equal to or more than the mean of historical mortality levels plus 1.66 times the standard deviation. If there are no historical mortality data, a herd problem can be defined as an increase in mortality that exceeds the national or regional level by 50%. In other words, if 50% or more of the pigs from a representative sample are diagnosed with PCVAD and there has been a significant increase in mortality compared with previous mortality data, it is considered a herd problem. However, if o50% of the pigs are diagnosed with PCVAD, but there has still been an increase in mortality or if more than 50% of the pigs are diagnosed with PCVAD but there has been no increase in mortality, the outbreak may be considered sporadic and not a herd problem. 150", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Management and Classification of Herd Outbreaks"}, {"text": "Prevention of PCVAD can be difficult. Disease outbreaks are reported to occur on farms even with strict isolation practices. It has been shown that vaccination against M. hyopneumonia or A. pleuropneumoniae 2-4 weeks in advance of infection with PCV2 prevented any lesions associated with PCV2 infection, 112 but the practical issues of this method make it nearly impossible to accomplish. PPV vaccination does not reduce the severity of PCVAD in coinfected pigs 105 but a combined PPV and swine erysipelas vaccine appeared to protect against PCV2-induced reproductive failure. 151 Treatment of bacterial infections and prevention of cofactor-associated diseases is also a good practice in preventing PCV2 diseases. Treating M. hyopneumonia with chlorotetracyclines was highly effective. 152 Bleach (3-6% sodium hypochlorite) is an effective chemical in killing PCV2, but has unknown field efficacy. The protocol utilized at Iowa State University to disinfect pens is included in Table 2 . 23 Good housing management is critical in disease prevention. It has been shown that reducing stress, paying attention to proper hygiene, preventing mixing of ages, and utilizing all in/all out practices are effective in controlling disease. Other options include immunized serum therapy, which has practical limitations, and depopulation, which has been shown to be ineffective because the virus is very resistant in the environment. 153 Whether PCV2 can be found in insects or wild animals that could possibly transmit disease to pigs is not known. However, because circoviruses are highly species specific, it is unlikely that these animals, excluding feral boars, would pose a threat of PCV2 transmission to domestic herds. 154 Risk factors for development of infection include PPV or PRRSV infection, large pen sizes versus small pen sizes for weaning piglets, increased levels of cross fostering 155 and vaccination against PRRSV. 156 As such, reduction of these risk factors on farms may be helpful in controlling PCVAD. A study in Canada showed a strong association of increased mortality with M. hyopneumoniae infection, PRRSV, diarrhea caused by Escherichia coli K88, close proximity to other herds, multiple suppliers, large within-group range in age of pigs and not using spray-dried plasma in 1st nursery rations. 157 Factors that decreased the risk included long empty times between pig groups, regular treatment of external parasites, pen versus crate gestation, internal versus external gilt replacement, 155 and vaccination against atrophic rhinitis. 156", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 308, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 578, "end": 581, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 788, "end": 791, "text": "152", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 990, "end": 992, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1428, "text": "153", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1721, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1895, "text": "155", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1930, "text": "156", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 2317, "end": 2320, "text": "157", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2514, "text": "155", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 980, "end": 987, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Prevention of PCV2-Associated Diseases"}, {"text": "Initial attempts at vaccine development included using a killed PPV vaccine.
