It recognises the Oantigenic repeating units of cell surface lipopolysaccharide of serogroup A, B and D1 as receptor, but also inactivates its receptor by endoglycosidase (endorhamnosidase) activity. In the \u00aenal step of bacteriophage P22 assembly six homotrimeric tailspike molecules are non-covalently attached to the DNA injection apparatus, mediated by their N-terminal, head-binding domains. We report the crystal structure of the head-binding domain of P22 tailspike protein at 2.3 A \u00ca resolution, solved with a recombinant telluromethionine derivative and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. The trimeric dome-like structure is formed by two perpendicular b-sheets of \u00aeve and three strands, respectively in each subunit and caps a three-helix bundle observed in the structure of the C-terminal receptor binding and cleaving fragment, reported here after full re\u00aenement at 1.56 A \u00ca resolution. In the central part of the receptor binding fragment, three parallel b-helices of 13 complete turns are associated side-byside, while the three polypeptide strands merge into a single domain towards their C termini, with close interdigitation at the junction to the b-helix part. Complex structures with receptor fragments from S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis and S. typhi253Ty determined at 1.8 A \u00ca resolution are described in detail. Insertions into the b-helix form the O-antigen binding groove, which also harbours the active site residues Asp392, Asp395 and Glu359. In the intact structure of the tailspike protein, head-binding and receptor-binding parts are probably linked by a\u00afexible hinge whose function may be either to deal with shearing forces on the exposed, 150 A \u00ca long tailspikes or to allow them to bend during the infection process.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "# 1997 Academic Press Limited", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Salmonella phage P22 is a dsDNA phage of the Podoviridae family, which is characterised by a short base plate or tail structure incorporated into one of the 12 5-fold vertices of the icosahedral phage head (Poteete, 1994;  Figure 1 ). Its scaffolding protein assisted assembly pathway proceeds though a DNA-free procapsid structure (Earnshaw & Casjens, 1980; Casjens & Hendrix, 1988) . The structure of the scaffolding-containing procapsid, an empty procapsid, and the mature capsid with T 7 laevo, analysed by cryo-electronmicroscopy at 22, 28 and 28 A \u00ca resolution, respectively, revealed a marked structural transition during DNA packing (Prasad et al., 1993; Thuman-Commike et al., 1996) . The formation of the short tail is initiated by incorporation of the portal protein 12-mer into one vertex of the procapsid during procapsid assembly together with 10 to 20 copies of each of three pilot proteins, gp7, gp16 and gp20 (Bazinet et al., 1988) . The pilot proteins and the portal complex are required for infectivity but not for procapsid assembly (Botstein et al., 1973) . Upon DNA packaging, proteins gp4, gp10 and gp26 are attached, forming the slender neck structure of the base plate. The portal vertex is both the site of DNA entry during phage maturation and DNA exit during infection. In the very last step of phage assembly tailspikes are attached to the neck structure. The tailspike protein, a homotrimer of 72 kDa subunits is anchored by its N-terminal, head-binding domain in a non-covalent but irreversible manner (Berget & Poteete, 1980; Maurides et al., 1990) .

While use of synchrotron radiation is essential to take advantage of the anomalous contribution of selenium by MAD phasing (Hendrickson, 1991) in Met(Se)-derivatives, Met(Te)-derivatives show good phasing with CuK a -radiation due to the larger number of additional electrons.
