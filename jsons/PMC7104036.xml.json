All were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and bronchodilators. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as 1 of the following: death from any cause, need for intubation/mechanical ventilation, readmission for COPD, or intensification of pharmacologic treatment. The results showed that patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids experienced a lower rate of treatment failure, but this was mostly related to the need for intensification of treatment in the placebo group (mainly adding glucocorticoids). Therefore the benefit of adding systemic corticosteroids early was, primarily, that one would avoid having to add them later. However, the steroid group also had a 1.2-day shorter LOS and a significant improvement in FEV1 on the day after enrollment, but also had significantly higher rates of hyperglycemia requiring medical therapy, in comparison with the control group. The investigators concluded that glucocorticoids offer a modest benefit in patients hospitalized with COPD, at the cost of significant hyperglycemia in some patients.",

Unfortunately no clinical trials have directly compared the efficacy of high-, medium-, or low-dose regimens. Doses ranging from 30 mg of methylprednisolone daily up to 125 mg of solumedrol every 6 hours (followed by a tapering dose) have shown beneficial effects.15, 20 A large observational study (which examined data on almost 80,000 patients) did not find any difference in outcomes (including initiation of mechanical ventilation, mortality, or readmission) in patients treated with high-dose (equivalent to 120\u2013800 mg/d prednisone) versus low-dose (equivalent to 20\u201380 mg/d prednisone) glucocorticoids for the first 2 days of admission.21\n\u2022These data suggest that very high initial doses of glucocorticoids are not advantageous, but the optimal dosing of glucocorticoids in AECOPD remains uncertain.

Although tobacco abuse and dependence is a chronic disease, it is widely believed that recurrent, brief counseling interventions will increase the likelihood of cessation.77 Hospitalization creates an unusual set of circumstances whereby the patient is temporarily not allowed to smoke, and is in direct contact with health care workers who can provide education and support. In addition, many hospitalized patients are treated with nicotine replacement therapy to curb the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Therefore, hospitalization is a perfect opportunity to encourage smoking cessation. A systematic review of studies of smoking cessation in hospitalized patients from 2008 demonstrated that counseling interventions in the hospital did result in improved cessation rates at 6 and 12 months (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.44\u20131.9), but only if the intervention continued (as phone or face-to-face contacts) for more than a month after discharge.78 Counseling efforts that were limited to the hospital stay, or persisted for less than 1 month after discharge, did not appear to improve cessation rates. This review also found that nicotine replacement therapy, when added to counseling, resulted in a trend toward improved cessation rates (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92\u20132.35).\u2022Therefore, hospitalists should recommend smoking cessation to all smokers who are hospitalized.\n",

            "text": "Patients who continue to require oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation at the time of discharge should be discharged with continuous oxygen therapy. Long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with severe hypoxemia.84 Guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society recommend that patients with hypoxemia be treated with long-term oxygen therapy (Fig. 2\n).9 Patients with an AECOPD often meet the criteria for long-term oxygen therapy at the time of hospital discharge, and hospitalists should prescribe oxygen in these cases. However, some of these patients who are discharged with home oxygen therapy after an AECOPD will have improved oxygenation as they recover from the acute illness, and will be able to eventually discontinue oxygen therapy. Reassessment of a patient\u2019s oxygen status is one important goal of the follow-up appointment already discussed. It is also worth noting that patients who use long-term oxygen therapy chronically (ie, they are using it at the time of admission) should generally continue that therapy after discharge, even if they appear not to meet criteria for it at the time of discharge. It is thought that long-term oxygen therapy may have a reparative effect over time in patients with chronic hypoxemia that leads to augmented oxygenation, which may be undone by discontinuing the oxygen therapy.9\n",

These programs include multiple interventions (which might include strength and endurance training, breathing exercises, smoking cessation, education, psychosocial interventions, and so forth), but a core part of this treatment involves training the muscles of ambulation. These programs decrease dyspnea, improve quality of life, and decrease hospitalization in COPD patients.85 Several studies have looked at the value of pulmonary rehabilitation, specifically in the context of an AECOPD. A Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of 9 studies of pulmonary rehabilitation after AECOPD (not all requiring hospitalization) demonstrated significant reduction in rates of hospitalization and death in those patients randomized to early pulmonary rehabilitation. Some quality-of-life measures were also improved in this group.86 Most of these studies started the rehabilitation within 10 days of discharge for those patients who were hospitalized, and the mean FEV1 was less than 40% predicted in most studies (range, 32%\u201352% predicted). Individually the studies in this meta-analysis were small and of modest methodologic quality, but taken together the findings are compelling.\u2022Hospitalists should consider early referral to pulmonary rehabilitation programs when arranging post-hospital care for their patients after an AECOPD.\n",
