Late-onset VAP occurs after 5 days, is more commonly caused by MDR pathogens, and carries higher morbidity and mortality (Table 1\n). The reported crude mortality rate for VAP ranges from 20% to 50%, and health care costs are estimated to be $15,000 to $40,000 per episode.1, 4, 13 In a recent study of outcomes of 126 intensive care unit (ICU) patients who received long-term ventilation in 5 ICUs at Duke University, the survival rate at 1 year was 56%, and only 9% of the patients were not in dependent care. Many patients had multiple admissions to a spectrum of transitional care facilities, with an estimated cost of $3.4 million dollars per patient.14\n",

Similar problems with chest radiograph interpretation and specificity have been noted by others.27, 30, 31 Data suggest that computerized tomography (CT) lung scans provide better resolution, but also have limitations, and are not readily available in many ICUs. Interpretation of chest infiltrates in critically ill patients could be improved with the use of CT lung scans, but this may be impractical for many ICU patients. In addition, the dose of radiation exposure is high and is equivalent to greater than100 portable chest radiographs.32, 33 Based on these clinical and radiological reservations, microbiologic criteria become the cornerstone for the diagnosis of VAT or VAP due to aerobic bacterial pathogens (see Table 2).",

Smears from EAs and cytospins of BAL or PSB specimens can be examined for PMNL and bacteria. Many PMNLs, along with bacteria, suggest infection and the presence of bacteria on Gram stain of EA corresponds to a bacterial colony count of greater than 105 colony forming units (cfu)/mL. Gram stain provides clues about bacterial morphology (cocci or bacilli), morphologic arrangement (clusters vs pairs or chains) and whether the bacteria belong to the gram-positive or gram-negative group. Absence of PMNL reduces the likelihood of bacterial infection, and the presence of many is suggestive of VARI. No bacteria on the smear, in the absence of recent treatment with antibiotics, suggests noninfectious or nonbacterial causes.",

VAP was most commonly late-onset, and the offending organism was P aeruginosa. Deputdt and colleagues37 used weekly Q-EA to detect VAP due to MDR pathogens, and found that VAP was due to MDR pathogens in 69% of the episodes. Surveillance cultures led to the appropriate antibiotic therapy in 96% of the patients. In a similar study with BAL confirmed VAP, Hayon and colleagues reported that Q-EA surveillance cultures identified at least one of the pathogens isolated by BAL, with the highest predictive value of cultures obtained within 72 hours of the VAP diagnosis.38, 39 Finally, Yang and colleagues38 used daily Q-EA cultures to identify patients with MDR P aeruginosa, and reported that colonized patients were more likely to develop VAP. Further studies are clearly needed to expand and confirm these results in different patient populations. There is also a need to look for optimal intervals between surveillance cultures to provide appropriate and timely therapy and improve patient outcome (see Fig. 6).",
