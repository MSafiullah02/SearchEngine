Conversely, RSV is the most common pathogen of pediatric LRTI; consequently, RSV outbreaks in the NICU are more common than PIV3. These differences might be associated with the method and kit for rapid testing for the virus antigen. There is no method and kit for rapidly testing for PIV3; therefore, detection of PIV3 might be more difficult. In previous reports of PIV3 outbreak in NICU, 2-8 virus culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. PCR is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting virus, but they cannot always be performed at all facilities. Therefore, we chose virus culture for testing respiratory infections of unknown origin and detected PIV3. PCR for multiple respiratory viruses has been widely implemented, and its application is increasing because of the better sensitivity and rapid turnaround time in the clinical care setting. In addition, it is easier to simultaneously diagnose multiple viruses in patients with co-infection. The more we perform PCR for multiple respiratory viruses and virus culture for respiratory infections of unknown origin in the NICU, the more frequently we might detect respiratory viruses, such as PIV, rhinovirus, coronavirus, Coxsackie virus, and echovirus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Most PIV infections are self-limited, but mortality and severe outbreaks in NICU that require ventilation have been reported in infants with severe comorbidities, 2-8 but no case of recurrent wheezing after discharge has been reported ( Table 2) . Particularly, in the present patients, the index case of CLD was the most severe. The index patient, ventilated for a long time with CLD, required supportive treatment after PIV3 infection and had recurrent wheezing after discharge for a long time. RSV has frequently been associated with recurrent wheezing in preterm infants. 1 In terms of PIV, Welliver et al. reported a rate of 85% and of 10% for recurrent wheezing episodes following PIV bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infection, respectively, 9 and LRTI may predispose to episodes of broncho-constriction on subsequent exposure. RSV and PIV have many structural, pathogenic, epidemiologic, and clinical similarities. 1 Therefore, the clinical course of PIV might be similar to that of RSV in many aspects. Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia present with chronic airway obstruction defined as recurrent episodes of wheezing and decreased lung function tests; and in some of these infants, obstructive lung disease persists into adulthood. 10 We speculate that the index case of severe CLD and PIV3 infection in a preterm infant early after birth worsened lung function, prompting the requirement for NCPAP. PIV3 infection might cause recurrent wheezing as observed in RSV infection, but it is not clear whether the present case of recurrent wheezing was caused by this PIV3 infection alone. We should consider PIV3 as one of the pathogens of respiratory infection of unknown origin in the NICU, and provide attention to severity if preterm infants with CLD develop PIV3 infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 576, "end": 577, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 758, "end": 759, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 932, "end": 933, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1268, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 245, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest.
