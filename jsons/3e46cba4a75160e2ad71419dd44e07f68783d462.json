Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices, universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load limitation (towards \"social distancing\") and access control. Simulators could support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations. Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data (\"Diamond Princess\" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).",

In this context, particular attention should be posed in organizing the restart of activities in public buildings like offices, schools, university and other workplaces. In such closed environment, the presence of the same users (e.g. workers, students) and the possibility of significant overcrowd conditions over space and time could amplify the possibility of prolonged contact with infected occupants (Adams et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) . In fact, the users can be daily and weekly exposed to the infections within the same rooms, during the whole period, with the possibility to stay at a limited distance and in a closed environment for a long time due to the performed activities. Such environmental factors could seriously increase the possibility of a user to be infected by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Yang et al., 2020) , as for other similar viruses (Adams et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2016; Pica and Bouvier, 2012; Prussin et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith et al., 2020) . Real-world cases of closed environment where the virus spread underline such possible effects on the occupants (see e.g. the Diamond Princess cruise emergency) (Fang et al., 2020; .",

Within the number of conditions evidenced by the national and international health organizations 1 , a probable case is a person: (a) having \"face-to-face contact with a COVID-19 case within 2m and > 15 minutes\" in any kind of environment, whose conditions include any direct contact with a confirmed infected case (including those related to physical contact, e.g. shaking hands, contacts with the infected case's secretions); (b) remaining \"in a closed environment (e.g. classroom, meeting room, hospital waiting room, etc.) with a COVID-19 case for 15 minutes or more and at a distance of less than 2 m\", whose conditions also include any indirect contact according to a proximity-based standpoint. Such a proximity-based approach is in line with general studies on the mechanisms leading to airborne diseases transmission (Chen et al., 2020; Pica and Bouvier, 2012; Prussin et al., 2020) . At the same time, a higher probability to be infected can be associated to the absence of individual's protection-based measures (respiratory protective devices, such as facial masks) (Bourouiba, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2020; Zhai, 2020) . Basing on experimental data also related to closed environments, previous studies tried to trace the general virus characterization in terms of: transmittal potential ; incubation period and timing to symptoms onset (e.g. fever) (Lauer et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith et al., 2020) ; asymptomatic ratio . Finally, the transmittal potential seems to increase in case of infectors' symptoms onset, as for other viruses (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) .",

To this aim, simulation tools could be useful in predicting how different mitigation solutions could affect the virus spreading, as also remarked by previous studies on airborne diseases mitigation (Emmerich et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2016; Laskowski et al., 2011; Saari et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2018) .

By this way, all direct and indirect contagion effects between individuals placed at a close distance can be simulated. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate the building fruition by the users (motion rules, occupancy during the time of some areas to perform activities) and the virus transmission between them. An agent-based modelling approach is chosen to define the specific simulation rules at each involved agent (Banos et al., 2015; Laskowski et al., 2011) , which can be described also in terms of spreading-affecting additional features (i.e. wearing a facial mask, being at a particular moment of the incubation period, being asymptomatic or not) (Fang et al., 2020; . In this view, the stochastic approach also enables to create different input scenarios and manage differences in the spreading trend inside the building. Meanwhile, the agent-based model allows considering microscopic rules for the simulated individuals (D'Orazio et al., 2014) , in this case consisting of the characterization of both use-of-spaces and virus-related issues (e.g. symptoms onset, use of respiratory protective devices, and so on) (Fang et al., 2020) . The proposed model is calibrated according to the application to a real COVID19 emergency scenario in a closed environment, using comparison of simulation results and experimental data . Finally, the application of the calibrated model is provided for a significant case study (a university building) to evaluate the impact of different mitigation strategies on the infected people's number.",

When the simulation starts, there is a certain percentage of occupants that is infected inside the Built Environment. Once an individual is infected, he/she can become an effective infector after the initial delay period (latent period), which corresponds to the initial phase during which the virus load increases up to provoke secondary infections. The contagion timing is t* [simulation step]. At t*=0, the agent becomes infected. Then, Idelay(t*) [simulation step], which is defined as the current step from the virus contagion, increases at each simulation step by a formcoeff (Idelay(t*)=Idelay(t*-1)+formcoeff; in case of linear relationship, formcoeff=1). Hence, formcoeff expresses the speed of the process after the moment of the contagion; \u2022 wearing or not a respiratory protective device (in the following: mask).

In particular, not asymptomatic people are considered to \"die\" (leave/not enter the building) when the current step from the virus contagion Istep [simulation step] reaches the timing to symptoms (e.g. fever) onset Ifev [simulation step] (Lauer et al., 2020) . The agent's \"die\" behaviour could both represent the effects of the disease for: 1) people who can be blocked by building access control system; 2) people who spontaneously leave/not enter the building due to their health conditions. At each simulation step, the model evaluates if an effective infector is placed near uninfected ones, assuming a radius of 2m as base proximity distance for contagion spreading Dvir [m], according to current consolidated rules provided by international health organizations 1 . In these conditions, each of the effective infector i has a chance to infect a neighbouring uninfected agent j according to Equation 1, which is based on previous modelling approaches (Fang et al., 2020) :",

It is assumed that a good access control solution will detect at least the 95% of the infectors while entering the building starting from the first simulation step. Hence, it is assumed that the implementation of access control strategies will imply initial infector % \u22645%; higher values will correspond to no implementation of access control strategies. These results are organized together to mainly outline different conditions in building operation issues. As output value, the final infected people percentage dI [%] is assessed according to Equation (5)",

The second source of results' uncertainty is mask filter (the type of mask adopted in terms of individual protection degree) showing also the importance of individual protection measures.

In this sense, the limitation of building use to Docc\u22640.3pp/m 2 (Figure 7-A) allows about a 20% reduction in needed mask filter*mask wearing% classes in respect to density maximization conditions (Figure 7-D) , to obtain dI<25%.

The same result is reached in case of no access control strategies implemented, by considering FFP3 and FFP2 implementation, as shown by Figure 10 . This outcome is due to the poor effect given by the implementation of access control strategies on the highest mask filter-based solutions, as remarked by Figure 11 : the main effect given by the implementation of access control strategies is the reduction of the overall dispersion of dI data for the class mask wearing% * mask filter=80% (see Figure 11 -A), which is -5% dispersed in respect to the same class for no access control strategies conditions (see Figure 11 -B), by considering the interval 25 th -75 th percentiles. Nevertheless, Figure 12 shows how poorer mask filter based solutions can take advantages of the access control strategies implementation: in particular, using FFP1 by about the 100% of the population in access control conditions could lead at dI<25% for more than the 50% of the simulated cases (Figure 12-A; here the FFP1 median at mask wearing%=100% is equal to about 10%), while extreme cases for surgical mask implementation falls under the limit dI thresholds (Figure 12-B) .

In general terms, the simulation outcomes evidence how using respiratory protective devices by occupants seems to generally lead to safer conditions for the occupants, especially if high protection measures will be adopted in terms of mask filter (\"invasive\" masks, like FFP ones) and of widespread implementation (about all the occupants should wear them). The reduction in the building occupants' density could reduce the needed effort in terms of respiratory protective devices especially when access control strategies are implemented to reduce the initial number of infectors entering the building. In this term, the simulation results agree with previous preliminary insights on the importance of facial masks to limit the contagion spreading after the activities restarting (Howard et al., 2020; Zhai, 2020) . The application of such strategy will lead to move towards the adoption of less invasive masks, e.g. surgical mask, by the whole number of the hosted individuals, as also suggested by review studies (Howard et al., 2020) . Such a solution could be more acceptable by the final users.",
