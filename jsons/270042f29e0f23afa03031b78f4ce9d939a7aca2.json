Accordingly, there is a huge need and responsibility for respiratory specimen collection pertaining to testing patients with suspected symptoms as well as those who have been in contact with confirmed patients and/or those who have visited risk areas recently. For this reason, several fast methods of sampling respiratory specimens from large numbers of testees are currently being tried.",

The DT system shortened the time of the entire screening process (registration, questionnaire, examination, specimen collection and instructions) to one-third of the conventional process (30 minutes shortened to 10 minutes per one person). 1 By adopting the DT system, the required healthcare manpower and personal protective equipment (PPE) consumption involved could be minimized also. However, the main limitation of the DT system is that it can only be available to individuals whose mode of transportation is the car.",

But one main shortcoming of the WT system is the costs required in building negative pressured booths (cost of 2.8 to 3 million Korean won per one WT booth). Safe and effective disinfection of the booth is another issue to be counted.",

And all daily reports of PCR tests on WT system booths have come out negative even though 2 COVID-19 patients have been detected by the WT test system. 2 However, more properly designed evaluations, such as PCR tests on the booth and PPE for the testers immediately after collection of respiratory specimens from already confirmed patients, and their follow up PCR tests after disinfection, are required.",
