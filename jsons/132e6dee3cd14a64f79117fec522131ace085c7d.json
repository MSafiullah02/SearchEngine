Datasets for indicators that are 41 fitting with the factors of COVID-19 mortality were extracted from the World Bank database. Out 42 of about 185 affected countries, only top 50 countries were selected to be analyzed in this study. 43 The following seven variables were included in the analysis, based on data availability and 44 completeness: 1) proportion of people aged 65 above, 2) proportion of male in the population, 3) 45 diabetes prevalence, 4) smoking prevalence, 5) current health expenditure, 6) number of hospital 46 beds and 7) number of nurses and midwives. Quantitative analysis was carried out to determine 47 the correlation between CFR and the aforementioned risk factors. 48 Results: United States shows about 0.20% of confirmed cases in its country and it has about 4.85% 49 of CFR. Luxembourg shows the highest percentage of confirmed cases of 0.55% but a low 2.05% 50 of CFR, showing that a high percentage of confirmed cases does not necessarily lead to high CFR. 51",

A study by 91 Guan et al. shows that COVID-19 are more commonly seen in patients with hypertension, diabetes, 92 cardiovascular disease and a history of smoking (12). Not only were these patients susceptible to 93 the disease, they also had a higher chance of obtaining poor health outcomes after Immediate Care 94 Unit (ICU) admission and may lead to death (10). Moreover, a study on the correlation between 95 COVID-19 mortality and BCG vaccination suggested that early BCG vaccination could help to 96 decrease the mortality rate (7). Other than that, malaria prevalence is also another risk factor of 97 COVID-19 mortality. According to the research conducted by Spencer, there is a higher number 98 of COVID-19 cases reported in countries with low malaria prevalence than countries that had 99 higher malaria prevalence (13) . Apart from addressing risk factors, there are also parameters that 100 may affect the COVID-19 mortality rate such as shortage of staff, lack of medical supply or 101 equipment, insufficient hospital beds and the country's health expenditure.",

Standardization was done by subtracting each value by the mean and 167 then dividing it with the standard deviation. Also, some variables (diabetes prevalence, current 168 health expenditure, and number of nurses and midwives) were divided into four equal categories 169 (i.e. in quartiles). All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel and R (ver. 3.6.0). A p-value 170 < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

This has been confirmed by our study where the proportion of people aged 65 and above 223 has shown a significant correlation with CFR. This indicates that countries with a higher proportion 224 of people aged 65 and above may result in higher COVID-19 mortality rate. Bhatraju et al. (2020) 225 has shown that in Seattle, the US reported more than 60% of COVID-19 deaths in patients aged 226 65 years and above than those who are younger than 65 years old (10). Verity et al. (2020) has 227 shown that the case fatality rate for those under age 60 was 1.4% while the fatality rate increases 228 drastically to 4.5% for those people aged over 60 years old (6). This shows that the older the 229 population, the higher the fatality rate. For those 80 years old and over, COVID-19 appears to have 230 a 13.4% fatality rate (6). Furthermore, deceased patients were found to be at an average age of 68 231 years old while recovered patients to be at an average age of 51 years old (11). These studies show 232 that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts certain groups, and older people is one of the 233 vulnerable groups. There is no one reason to this; it is believed that immune system declines with 234 age. An increase of deficiency in T-cell and B-cell function and overproduction of type 2 cytokines 235 as age increases (9). This may increase the viral replication and extend the duration of pro-236 inflammatory responses leading to poor health results (9). Older people tend to have more 237 underlying conditions that may also be risk factors for severe 12) .",

Further investigation is needed to define the actual 251 association between diabetes prevalence and COVID-19. Although smoking prevalence has shown 252 no significant association with COVID-19, it cannot be assumed that there is no correlation 253 between other co-morbidities and COVID-19 CFR since not all factors were considered in this 254 study, such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (18). Patients with existing comorbidities , 255 including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and history of smoking, seems to be 256 associated with COVID-19 more severely (12). With reference to a retrospective study of 113 257 deceased patients from COVID-19, 48% of the patients had chronic hypertension and 14% of them 258 had cardiovascular diseases (11). In addition to that, COVID-19 patients who have hypertension 259 were closely associated with poor health outcomes after hospital admission.

It is necessary for some countries may need 264 more supplies than others to cater all sick patients, and thus increasing the health expenditure of 265 the country (2). Some of the medical supplies include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 266 mechanical ventilators, COVID-19 testing kits and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation 267 (ECMO). Due to surge of demand on health care system, countries with low income and poor 268 healthcare infrastructure suffer the most (12). However, in our study, current health expenditure 269 does not significantly correlate to an arising COVID-19 CFR. One possible explanation to this is270 the various levels of well-preparedness plans implemented in the country to handle this pandemic 271 situation. These include availability of medicines or medical supplies to treat COVID-19 patients, 272 availability of suitable places to quarantine or self-isolate these patients, number of healthcare 273 professionals and a strategized interventions, such as social distancing, quarantine, isolation 274 actions and proper management, for the patients and public to flatten the curve and to reduce 275 healthcare burden. 276 Even though there is no significant correlation, this does not indicate health expenditure is not 277 important. Hospital beds is an example of hospital expenditures, and is important in the 278 improvement of hospitals by making adjustments in volume-based to fulfill healthcare demands 279 (2). Improvement in hospital capacity is necessary to accommodate any future pandemic situations 280 (22). Despite the insignificant correlation to COVID-19 CFR, accessibility to adequate hospital 281 beds for COVID-19 patients can potentially affect the CFR as the number of beds required depends 282 on the number of confirmed cases in each country. Apart from hospital beds, other medical 283 supplies such as PPE and mechanical ventilators must be sufficient as they are the key equipment 284 for frontline healthcare workers (23-25). Evidence of high numbers of infections and deaths 285 among healthcare workers due to lack of PPE were reported in Italy (23). In the US, recent 286 estimates have suggested that the estimated ventilators needed is ranging from several hundred 287 thousand to a million, far more than what are currently available (23). It is difficult to estimate the 288 exact number of ventilators needed as it depends on the number, transmission rate and severity of 289 the disease in each country. Although there is no significant relationship between the number of 290 nurses and midwives and CFR, number of healthcare professionals is a crucial factor in the 291 COVID-19 outbreak. The reason to this insignificance can be due inadequate data obtained as the 292 data collected are only numbers of nurses and midwives. It is important to take into account the 293 numbers of other healthcare professionals. Physicians and nurses who had no disease expertise 294 were also recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19 (25). Recognizing the risk of 295 healthcare workers shortages and ensuring them to have adequate rest and to feel supported are 296 important to maintain individual and team performance in overcoming challenges presented by 297 COVID-19 (24).",
