We have developed several synthetic inhibitors by structurebased drug design. In this report, we reveal two crystal structures of SARS 3CL pro complexed with two new inhibitors based on our previous work. These structures combined with six crystal structures complexed with a series of related ligands reported by us are collectively analyzed. To these eight complexes, the structural basis for inhibitor binding was analyzed by the COMBINE method, which is a chemometrical analysis optimized for the protein-ligand complex. The analysis revealed that the first two latent variables gave a cumulative contribution ratio of r 2 5 0.971. Interestingly, scores using the second latent variables for each complex were strongly correlated with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of side-chain heavy atoms of Met 49 from those of the intact crystal structure of SARS-3CL pro (r 5 0.77) enlarging the S 2 pocket. The substantial contribution of this side chain (10%) for the explanation of pIC 50 s was dependent on stereochemistry and the chemical structure of the ligand adapted to the S 2 pocket of the protease. Thus, starting from a substrate mimic inhibitor, a design for a central scaffold for a low molecular weight inhibitor was evaluated to develop a further potent inhibitor.

            "text": "A lthough the primary epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1-3 was eventually brought under control, the recent identification of a SARS CoV (coronavirus)-like virus in Chinese bats 4, 5 indicates that there are natural reservoirs for this virus. Since no effective therapy exists for these viral infections, developing anti-SARS agents against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge. In the early stage of the infection, SARS 3CL protease (3CL pro ) is a key enzyme to cleave polyproteins to yield functional polypeptides for replication. 6, 7 The 3CL pro is a cysteine protease containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad. Because of its functional importance in the viral lifecycle, 3CL pro is considered an attractive target for the structurebased design of drugs against SARS. Thus, numerous inhibitors of 3CL pro have been reported including peptide-mimics [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and small molecules derived from natural products, [13] [14] [15] anti-viral agents, 16, 17 anti-malaria agents, 18 or high throughput screening. [19] [20] [21] [22] In the course of our own studies on SARS 3CL pro and its inhibitors, 23 we found that mature SARS 3CL pro is sensitive to degradation at the 188Arg/189Gln site, and the Arg188Ile mutant is resistant to this degradation. As a result, this stable mutant protease makes it feasible for evaluating designed and synthesized inhibitors. Exploring useful inhibitors for SARS 3CL pro based on the substrate revealed that peptide aldehyde is a facile for designing an inhibitor for SARS 3CL pro . Through combinations of the systematic substitution of peptide aldehyde amino acid and the crystallographic analysis of the complexes, a leading inhibitor (Table  I , entry 1) emerged. This peptide-based inhibitor has all of its side-chain structures differing from the substrate nonprime site sequence, Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln, except at the P 3 site where the side-chain was directed outward. Especially, substitution of Leu to cyclohexyl alanine (Cha) P 2 of the peptide inhibitor gave a higher increase in inhibitory potency to SARS 3CL pro (Table I , entries 1 and 2). Moreover, crystallographic analysis of the inhibitor complex provided an extended design of both deletion at the P 5 residue and mutation providing a hetero atom at the P 4 position of the inhibitor. Evaluation of IC 50 in the protease and crystallographic analysis revealed that this down size design was clearly realized without any substantial decrease in potency (Table I, entry 3) . Based on this wide range surveillance of the surroundings of the active sites by the peptide aldehyde inhibitor, a novel non-peptide inhibitor based on interactions at the S 1 and S 2 sites of SARS 3CL pro was designed and synthesized. 24 In the study, focusing on the fact that P 1 and P 2 sites interact with the catalytic dyad and hydrophobic pocket, respectively, compounds were designed by connecting the P 2 site cyclohexyl group of the substrate-based inhibitor to the main-chain at a2nitrogen atom of the P 2 position Cha via a methylene linker. This strategy gave aza-decaline as a central scaffold of the inhibitor with expected restricted conformational diversity of the P 2 site. The designed compounds showed substantial inhibitory activity. By X-ray crystallographic studies ( Figure  1) , it was confirmed that the aza-decaline inhibitors were at the active site cleft of 3CL pro and the aza-decaline scaffold was inserted into a large S 2 pocket, while most of the S 2 pocket was occupied. Interestingly, the stereochemistry on the azadecaline scaffold, (4aS,8aR) and (4aR,8aS), showed clear dif-ferences in inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL pro (Table I  entries 4-6) . Thus, starting from the substrate mimic peptide aldehyde as a leading compound, we have been developing nonpeptidic inhibitors by extracting fine structure-activity relationships from these crystallographic analyses. However, this stereostructure-activity relationship was not fully evaluated because of a shortage of samples for structural comparison.",

Gil-Redondo and colleagues 26 developed gCOM-BINE, which is a user-friendly graphical interface, to perform the analysis with defined input files and sophisticated result presentations. Since the ligand-induced structural alternation is taken into account, ligand-receptor interactions can be better understood by chemometrical analysis. This method has been applied to various analyses of quantitative structureactivity relationships. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .",

Briefly, starting from an enantiomixture of alcohol a, previously reported product 24 by Diels-Alder reaction, the primary alcohol was converted to azide and then the amino group (b). Amine b was condensed with N-Boc-N-phenyl b-alanine (Ph-(Boc)bAla) to afford an enantio-mixture of compound c, a precursor of the cyclization reaction. Amide c, in which the nitrogen of the amide group located at 5-carbon apart from olefin, was cyclized with a Pd-based catalysis. 42 The obtained enantio-mixture of an aza-decaline derivative, olefin d was converted to diol and then to aldehyde by Lemieux-Johnson oxidation. The resulting aza-decalinederived aldehyde and H-His(Trt)-N(CH 3 )OCH 3 were condensed via reductive amination to give a diastereo-mixture of compound e. This diastereo-mixture was separated and purified by flash column chromatography into 7e and 8e corresponding in stereochemistry to 7 and 8, respectively. Trt and Boc groups of 7e and 8e were removed and purified by a silica column. Finally, Weinreb amides were converted to aldehyde and then purified by RP-HPLC. Yields were 3% and 1% for 7 and 8, respectively, based on the enantio-mixture of olefin d. ",

That is, this program was used to calculate the Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions between the inhibitor and each protein residue on a per residue basis. gCOMBINE is a graphical interface that runs COM-BINE. The gCOMBINE automatically arranges and constructs an X matrix in which the rows represent the different compounds studied, and the columns contain the residue-based energy information, which is separated into two blocks (van der Waals and electrostatic), plus an additional column (Y matrix) containing the experimental binding affinities. This X matrix was then projected onto a small number of orthogonal LVs using partial least-squares (PLS) analysis, and the original energy terms were given weights, w i , according to their importance in the model, in the form of PLS pseudo coefficients. The higher these coefficients are, the more significant they are for explaining the variance in the experimental data. Thus, in this study, the van der Waals interactions, u vdw i , and the electrostatic interactions, u ele i , between the inhibitor and each protein residue were selected to estimate the pIC 50 value. The variables that were unimportant for activities were discarded, and the remaining variables were used to build ",

Figure 1 shows a summary of our previous structural analysis of the complex with 1-6. The chemistry of the aza-decaline derived inhibitors including 7 and 8 was divided into three portions: histidine aldehyde (His-al), aza-decaline, and an Nacyl part ( Figure 1B) . The His-al part took an almost identical conformation and similarly interacted with the 3CL pro over the complexes examined. Briefly, His-al is located at the active center of 3CL pro as aldehyde and an imidazole ring interacted with the catalytic dyad, thiol of Cys, and imidazole of His, respectively. Thus, the His-al part functioned as a pharmacophore in these compounds. In contrast, the N-acyl part of the aza-decaline based inhibitors, 4, 5, and 6 were directed outward of 3CL pro and then opposite to the P 3 to P 4 sites of peptide mimic inhibitors, 1, 2, and 3. Based on these observations, compounds 7 and 8 were designed as making an aromatic ring of the N-acyl part feasible to access the S 3 or S 4 pocket of 3CL pro via a relatively flexible b-alanine linker and are expected to provide greater potency. The stereochemistry of compounds 7 and 8 corresponded to compounds 4 and 5, respectively. As for the template for the synthesis of the designed compounds, aza-decaline is an attractive scaffold which is restricted in configuration and can provide distinct and relative positions and directions with substituents. Considering this ability of extension, among the three parts of the basic inhibitor design, an aza-decaline was constructed by two cyclization steps utilizing different chemistries, Diels-Alder and diastereo-selective cyclization by PdCl 2 (AcCN) 2 for cyclohexyl and aza-cyclohexyl on the cyclohexyl, respectively. Since the second cyclization is feasible to react with a wide variety of substrates, the acylation is scheduled in the early steps. On the other hand, since the His-al part contains a labile group, aldehyde, the reductive amination is scheduled in the late steps. In the present study, the synthetic scheme worked well at least for synthesis of inhibitors 4-8. Production of a wide variety of inhibitors containing various stereochemistries is to be examined elsewhere based on these key reactions. 42, 59, 60 Although compounds 7 and 8 were designed based on the structural analysis mentioned earlier, the IC 50 s were not improved in comparison with those of the corresponding compounds 4 and 5, respectively. Compound 7 and 8 inhibited hydrolysis of SARS 3CL pro in IC 50 , 275 lM and 215 lM, respectively.",

Briefly, the aldehyde group and imidazole ring of His-al of these inhibitors took an almost identical conformation and similarly interacted with 3CL pro . In contrast, the direction of the aza-substituents of the aza-decaline based inhibitors, 7 and 8 ( Figure 2B ), were outward from 3CL pro and opposite to the P 3 to P 4 sites of peptide mimic inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 as in our previous inhibitors, 4, 5, and 6 ( Figure 1A) . Thus, crystallographic analyses of the SARS 3CL pro in complexes with compounds 7 and 8 revealed that in our case the bAla was not functioning as a flexible linker to reach the Ph group of the hydrophobic S 3 pocket. These features were in good accordance with the deteriorated IC 50 s of 7 and 8, which may be due to a higher entropic discordance of 7 and 8 than of 4 and 5, respectively. The trans aza-decaline scaffolds of 7 and 8 were adapted in the S 2 pocket as deep as 4 and 5, respectively. Based on these structural analyses focusing on the chemical structure of the inhibitors, several points to increase potency were revealed. The aza-decaline structure is sufficient to be adapted in the S 2 pocket, and stereochemistry on the aza-decaline is a determinant for orientation in the S 2 pocket (Figure 3) . Interestingly, the orientation of aza-decaline in the S 2 pocket was not critical but was a determinant for relative potency; 4 and 7 were better than 5 and 8, respectively, in which these scaffolds almost crossed perpendicular to each other when complex structures were superimposed by the whole protein. Thus, the trans azadecaline scaffold is suitable for embedding into the S 2 pocket. In comparison with peptide aldehyde inhibitors (Figure 4) , to make the N-acyl-group of aza-decaline based inhibitors feasible to interact with the S 3 and S 4 sites, regioisomers such as 3, 3-disubstituent or 3, 4-subtituted trans aza-decaline may be necessary.",

Some of the pockets were located over the structural domains. The figure revealed that S 1 and S 2 contribute to inhibitor binding more than other pockets. Extensively, even in the region of S 1 , in which all the examined inhibitors interacted with an identical His aldehyde structure, the calculated energies were not identical. This result illustrates that substitutions can affect fine interactions of the pharmacophore. These energy descriptors for each complex and the corresponding pIC 50 comprise the X and Y matrix for the gCOMBINE analysis, respectively. The COMBINE program does PLS analysis such that the composed X matrix is then projected onto a small number of orthogonal LVs in an optimized manner for protein-ligand interaction. Table III shows a chemometric summary of the analysis for the indices of 5 LVs. The optimal dimensionality of the PLS models was determined by monitoring the cross-validation indexes as a function of the number of LVs extracted. The cross-validation procedure employed the lease-one-out method. The predictive ability of the resulting models was reported by both the cross-validated correlation coefficient (q 2 ) and the standard deviation of error in the predictions. The q 2 value served as the criterion to determine the optimal dimensionality of the PLS model. Thus, for further analysis, we decided to take ranks by 2 as our model. At this rank, the linear regression analysis reached r 2 5 0.97 (correlation coefficient). Similar to the primary component analysis, this indicates that the first and second LVs contribute 87% and 10% of the explanation of pIC 50 s in this system, respectively.

At the top, the schematic drawing of the secondary structure of 3CL pro along with the residue number is presented. Next, the S 2 pocket was highlighted in the examining residues related with the second LV. Among these residues, it was revealed that configuration of the dominant Met 49 is connected to the inhibitory effect of ligand binding. Figure 8A shows that the active site superimposed on the total 3CL pro structures 1-9. Structure 9 contains no inhibitor. The catalytic Cys-His dyads were well overlapped. On the other hand, the configuration of Met 49 side chains was separated into two groups. In one group, no ligand (9), Leu side chain (1), and (3R,4aS,8aR) aza-decaline (4 and 8) were involved. In the other group, the Cha side chain (2 and 3) and (3S,4aR,8aS) aza-decaline (5, 6 and 7) were involved. Inhibitors in the latter group had greater potency in comparison with the corresponding chemical structures. Thus, the S 2 pocket is enlarged on the potent inhibitors by reorientation of the Met 49 side chain. Figure 8B shows the correlation between the X score of each complex corresponding to the second LV model and each RMSD of the Met 49 side chain heavy atom of complexes from that of structure 9. These values were strongly correlated with r 5 0.77. Thus, the main contribution to the second LV was the orientation of the Met 49 side chain followed by enlarging the S 2 pocket. The isobutyl group of the Leu side chain was not sufficient for inducing this reorientation. Even if a large functional group such as azadecaline occupied the S 2 pocket, the angle between the plane consisting of the chair-chair configuration of aza-decaline and to Met 49 was critical for the configurational change, which can be controlled by the stereochemistry of position 3 of the azadecaline scaffold. These analyses revealed that the aza-decaline scaffold with stereochemistry of S at position 3 is a novel scaffold for designing an inhibitor to 3CL pro . As mentioned in inhibitor-based analysis, optimized regioisomers need to be elucidated. The key feature of the interaction in the S 2 pocket gives a novel strategy for developing a new inhibitor.",

This fact highlights the advantages of the COMBINE method. Together with ligandbased analysis and the COMIBINE analysis focusing on FIGURE 7 Scatter plot of amino acid residues contributing to the LVs. The vertical and horizontal axes correspond to the first and second LVs, respectively. The relevant energy descriptors have been labeled.",

For aza-decaline based inhibitors, the potencies decreased during design. Structural analysis revealed that orientation of the substituent on the aza-decaline scaffold was not suitable for interacting with the protein. The COMBINE analysis revealed that the volume of the S 2 pocket perturbed by stereochemistry of the ligand is important for inhibitor potency. This is derived as the second LV (10% explanation of the X matrix). Further design and synthesis of inhibitors are expected.",
