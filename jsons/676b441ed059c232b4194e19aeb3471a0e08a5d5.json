Syndactyly is called complete when adjacent digits (phalanges 1 to 3) are connected throughout their entire length with soft tissue and/or bone and incomplete when they are not connected throughout their entire length (Ger 1998 , Kozin 2003 , Dao and others 2004 . All cases in the veterinary literature with complex syndactyly have a complete simple syndactyly. Complex syndactyly is further classified as complicated or uncomplicated. Complicated complex syndactyly is associated with other anomalies whereas uncomplicated complex syndactyly is not associated with other anomalies (Kozin 2003) . This classification has also been used for syndactyly feline and canine patients (Tables 1 and 2) (Towle and Breur 2004) .",

This means that syndactyly in human beings is propagated in family lines, may not be present in full form in each patient (phenotypic variation) and may skip a generation (Kozin 2003) . It is also associated with defects of the second chromosome (Kozin 2003) . Syndactyly in human beings has been associated with a mutation of the homeobox D cluster-13 (Hoxd-13) gene, fibroblast growth factor receptors, ligand Wnt-1 and transcription factor Msx-2 (Daluiski and others 2001 , Arias and Stewart 2002 , Gilbert 2003 .

            "text": "Feline syndactyly is a rare condition, and to our knowledge, there are only four previous reports of this condition. Thus, information on the clinical presentation and concurrent anomalies, clinical and radiographic findings and possible links to heredity and methods of prevention is limited. All reported cases were affected with complex syndactyly. In two of the previous reports, the affected cats also had ectrodactyly (Searle 1953) or a family history of polydactyly (Howe 1902) . Thus, although the kittens in the present report did not have concurrent anomalies, feline syndactyly may be associated with polydactyly or ectrodactyly (complicated syndactyly). This parallels canine syndactyly, in which approximately half of the reported cases are complicated (Table 2) . All affected cats in the previous four and in this report were presented without lameness and the kittens in the present report had not developed lameness at the time of writing. This is similar to canine syndactyly, where all reported cases with complex syndactyly were without lameness and only cases with simple syndactyly were presented with lameness. Paw changes in syndactyle cats include abnormal or absent digits, abnormal shape, fusion or absence of digital pads and abnormal shape or fusion of nails. Dissection of feline syndactyle legs demonstrated that deep digital flexor muscles to fused digits were often absent (Howe 1902 , Hays 1917 . In general, the musculature corresponded to the skeletal anomalies, for example, fused digits corresponded to single-muscle units and some muscles were lacking in entirety. Radiographic findings consisted of complete or incomplete joining of phalanges 1 to 3 and metacarpal or metatarsal bones (Howe 1902 , Hays 1917 , Searle 1953 , Boehringer 1975 . Both the external and radiographic features of feline syndactyly are similar to those of canine complex syndactyly. However, a lack of cutaneous separation between digits without osseous abnormalities, as seen in canine simple syndactyly (Richardson and others 1994) , has not been observed (Howe 1902 , Hays 1917 , Searle 1953 , Boehringer 1975 ).",

Both males and females were affected. It was concluded that ectrodactyly combined with syndactyly was due to the action of a heterozygous gene with a variable expression. In another report, syndactyly was reported in a colony of polydactyle cats (Howe 1902) . Although the incidence of syndactyly in this colony was not reported, it may be that syndactyly was an inherited trait, just like polydactyly (Howe 1902) . In the present report, environmental and family histories were not available. However, because four of the six kittens in the litter were affected, a genetic background for the syndactyly is not unlikely (Thrusfield 1988, Patterson and others 1989) . Thus, it may be that almost all reported feline syndactyly cases have a genetic aetiology.",

Because syndactyly may be a hereditary trait, a detailed history with questions about syndactyly in littermates and previous litters (including male:female ratio) and other related cats should be obtained. Information on drug exposure, maternal disease or radiation exposure during the first and second trimester of gestation should be collected to determine possible causative environmental factors (Towle and Breur 2004) . The clinician should perform a thorough general physical examination to detect other congenital anomalies. The paws should be carefully examined for abnormal or absent digits, abnormal shape, fusion or absence of digital pads and abnormal shape or fusion of nails. Radiographic changes may be dramatic and can include complete or incomplete fusion of phalanges and metatarsal or metacarpal bones. The diagnosis of complex syndactyly is based on clinical and radiographic findings. It appears that feline complex syndactyly causes minimal to no discomfort and reported patients affected with this condition have presented without lameness. Therefore medical or surgical treatment of this condition is not recommended. Because the condition may be hereditary, breeding of affected animals should be discouraged and it is recommend that affected animals be neutered or spayed.",
