            "text": "Before going into the epidemiological evidence on the effectiveness of medical facemasks in preventing respiratory infection, it is important to clarify the difference between surgical masks and respirators. Respirators, formally known as \u2018disposable filtering half-facepiece respirators\u2019, are designed to reduce the user\u2019s exposure to airborne particles (e.g. fine dust generated from industrial processes such as grinding of metals, or biological aerosols generated from sneezing) by forming a tight-fit seal around the user\u2019s face, which requires a careful fit test before use and is difficult to achieve in the presence of facial hair.8,9 The most common respirator being used by health care workers are N95 respirators, which should reduce inhalation exposure to airborne particles by at least 95% if worn properly. Surgical masks are chiefly designed to prevent droplet transmission from health care workers to surgical patients, or blood-borne infection from patients to health care workers during medical procedures, but they lack the air-tightness that respirators have, and are generally considered to be ineffective in preventing airborne infection.8,10,11 Nonetheless, given the substantially higher cost of respirators and the challenges related to manufacturing, fit testing, comfort and compliance, there has been growing interest in investigating the ability of surgical masks to prevent droplet-borne respiratory infection.8,10,11",

            "text": "The answer to this is unambiguous. By design, a facemask with sufficiently high filtering efficiency can act as a passive barrier to stop infected individuals from spreading pathogens through droplets or aerosol from talking, coughing or sneezing, and they can reduce fomite transmission by reducing the chance of people spreading their body fluids after touching their nose or mouth. If worn properly, facemasks are likely to be superior to active practices such as covering up the nose or mouth when sneezing or coughing, which could contaminate individual\u2019s hands or clothing and increase the risk of fomite transmission. This may be especially relevant for COVID-19, as emerging evidence suggests that transmission by asymptomatic or afebrile patients may play an important role in spreading the disease.12\u201314",

            "text": "This is at the centre of the controversy. In this scenario, a facemask needs to block pathogens from external sources (e.g. infected individuals), which places significantly greater demand on the facemask\u2019s particle filtering efficiency and on user compliance. Health care workers are at particularly high risk of infection due to the nature of their jobs. Preventing health care workers from contracting and spreading infection is one of the key priorities in health care settings. There has been largely consistent randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence in health care workers that wearing surgical masks and N95 respirators can reduce the risks of respiratory illnesses [including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)] by 40\u201360%, after accounting for key confounders such as other protective equipment or hygiene measures.8,11 However, uncertainty remains as to whether surgical masks are inferior to N95 respirators in preventing infection. A recent meta-analysis shows that, compared with surgical mask use, use of N95 respirators is associated with a >50% reduced risk of overall clinical respiratory illness but has no apparent superiority in preventing viral infection,11 which is supported by a more recent large-scale RCT in an outpatient setting.8 Despite the potential superiority of N95 respirators over surgical masks, the evidence in health care workers defies a common claim that surgical masks are ineffective for prevention because some coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) may be airborne in specific scenarios (e.g. during aerosol generating procedures) and/or can infect people through the mucous membranes of the eyes.",

For example, non-compliance, such as incomplete coverage of the mouth and nose or frequent removal and re-use of the same facemask in public spaces, is frequently reported as a major challenge in previous studies; but these could be addressed through enhancing public health education.15,16",

First, it creates a social norm in the society and increases the level of risk perception among the general public, which may in turn improve personal hygiene behaviours.16,20 Whereas the biggest direct benefit of facemasks use, if any, comes from infected individuals wearing them properly, the social norm may amplify such benefit by putting more pressure on individuals with respiratory symptoms to wear facemasks, and even asymptomatic patients are more likely to wear a facemask without the knowledge of their health condition. Furthermore, compared with other hygiene measures, wearing facemasks is a highly visible and iconic behaviour that might increase the public\u2019s risk awareness and encourage them to seek other relevant health information and improve their personal hygiene behaviours, many of which have been proven to be effective in infection control (e.g. handwashing, social distancing).15",

The sudden surge of demand on facemasks in East Asia (together with reduced productivity in China and other factors) has contributed to a global shortage that in turn has disrupted supplies to health care providers worldwide, who have the greatest need not only for COVID-19 but also for standard protective equipment. The shortage has also induced further panic in high-risk areas such as Hong Kong and China, which threatens effective risk communication, outbreak control measures and the economy. International cooperation and strong leadership are needed to handle the epidemic and its collateral damage. This includes stabilizing the global supply chain of facemasks (as well as other medical supplies) to high-risk areas, developing evidence-based and context-specific guidelines on infection control and risk communication strategies, and striking a fine balance between the cost and benefits of different interventions. It is also important for public health officials to educate the public that, whereas facemasks may have potential value in infection control in certain contexts: they must be worn properly to be effective; they are just one of the many relevant strategies; and panic buying or stockpiling of any medical supplies should be discouraged.",
