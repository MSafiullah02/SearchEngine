            "text": "Astroviruses (AstV), family Astroviridae, are non-enveloped viruses with a diameter of 28\u201330 nm and with a typical star-like shape. The genome is a single strand of positive sense, RNA of 6.4-7.3 kb in size, containing three overlapping ORFs (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2) with a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (Mendez and Arias, 2007). ORF1a encodes a serine 3C type of viral protease. ORF1b is separated from ORF1a by a heptameric frame shift signal (AAAAAAC) and encodes the viral RNA polymerase. ORF2 encodes an 87-kDa polypeptide, which functions as the capsid precursor. AstV infection is associated with gastroenteritis in many animal species and humans, and they are also associated with extra-intestinal diseases, such as nephritis in chickens, hepatitis in ducks and shaking syndrome in minks (Imada et al., 2000, Fu et al., 2009, Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). The evolution of AstVs is driven by mechanisms of genetic drift, recombination and, possibly, inter-species transmission (Finkbeiner et al., 2008, De Benedictis et al., 2011, Martella et al., 2014).",

However, taking advantage of broad-range PCR primers for AstVs and metagenomic protocols, several novel AstVs have been identified in a number of mammalian and avian species (Chu et al., 2008, Finkbeiner et al., 2008, Bosch et al., 2010, De Benedictis et al., 2011). Using the classification criteria adopted in the 9th ICTV report that is based on genetic analysis of the full-length ORF2, an additional 14 MAstV and 4 AvAstV candidate species have been defined recently (Schultz-Cherry, 2013).",

            "text": "AstV-like particles have been detected only occasionally in dogs by EM, either alone or in co-infection with other enteric viruses (Williams, 1980, Marshall et al., 1984, Vieler and Herbst, 1995, Toffan et al., 2009). More recently, AstVs have been identified in dogs with enteric signs and characterized molecularly, suggesting that the detected viruses may represent a distinct AstV species (Toffan et al., 2009). Also, a canine AstV, strain ITA/08/Bari, was successfully adapted to replicate in vitro on MDCK cells, and AstV-specific antibodies were detected in convalescent canine sera (Martella et al., 2011a, Martella et al., 2011b, Martella et al., 2012). The prevalence of AstV infection seems higher in dogs with enteric disease than in asymptomatic animals (Martella et al., 2011a, Martella et al., 2011b, Zhu et al., 2011, Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015, Takano et al., 2015). Also, monitoring of natural infection by AstV in dogs has revealed that the acute phase of gastroenteritis overlaps with peaks of viral shedding (Martella et al., 2012). At present, limited and partial information on canine AstV genomes is available in GenBank. This limited amount of information seems to suggest that canine AstVs are genetically heterogeneous (Martella et al., 2011a, Martella et al., 2011b, Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015), thus posing a challenge for the diagnostic and for the understanding of the genetic and biological properties of these viruses in dogs.",

The difference between groups was not statistically significant (chi-square value, 1.003; p = 0.316). A subset (n = 37) of samples was selected from 33 animals for viral metagenomics to detect virus diversity in canine fecal specimens. Among these 37 samples 26 specimens contained eukaryotic origin viral sequences (Fig. 1\n). By viral metagenomics (Table 1\n), AstV RNA was initially identified in 11 out of 37 fecal specimens (29.7%). However, the proportion of AstV specific reads ranged from 1 out of 18711 ( < 0.1%) to 1627 out of 1635 (99.5%) eukaryotic viral sequence reads, respectively, and five samples that had very low AstV sequence read numbers (range, 1\u20134) were not considered for further processing. Other enteric viruses detected in the stools included parvovirus (in 20 samples), coronavirus (in 14 samples), rotavirus (in 11 samples), picornavirus (in 7 samples), gyrovirus (in 1 sample), adenovirus (in 1 sample) and calicivirus (in 1 sample). Overall, by either the pan-astrovirus RT-PCR or by the viral metagenomic screening, we identified AstV RNA in 17/63 (26.9%) samples. Interestingly, some samples negative in RT-PCR generated AstV-specific reads by deep sequencing, whilst, in turn, some samples containing AstV-specific reads tested negative by the pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, indicating a weak correlation between the two methodologies (Table 1).",

In addition, there was a second in-frame ATG start codon, located 180 nt upstream of the start codon homologous to other Mamastrovirus genomes. Only in strain HUN/2012/8, this additional in-frame start codon was located 141 nt upstream of the first start codon. During the RNA replication, ORF2 is expressed from a sgRNA (Walter and Mitchell, 2003, Mendez et al., 2014). The sgRNA promoter sequence has a highly conserved nucleotide sequence motif and is present upstream of the ORF2 start codon (Mendez et al., 2014). The highly conserved nucleotide stretch upstream of ORF2, ATATGGAGGGGAGGACCAAAAAATTGCGATGGC, believed to be part of a promoter region for synthesis of sgRNA, was completely conserved in the sequence of canine AstV strains except for the sequence of strain HUN/2012/8, that was CTTTGGAGGGGAGGACCAAAGCAGCGCTATGGC.",

In the ORF1a-based tree (Fig. 3A), only five canine AstV strains generated in this study and two AstV strains from UK could be included, as information on the ORF1a is not available for other canine AstVs. Although monophyletic, the canine AstVs segregated in two distinct branches, with strain HUN/2012/126 in the basal position. When enlarging the number of analysed sequences, in the ORF1b (Fig. 3B), this pattern of segregation was confirmed. Four strains (HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, HUN/2012/115, and HUN/2012/135) were grouped with the majority of canine AstVs identified in European and extra-European countries, whilst strain HUN/2012/126 clustered with the highly virulent strain ITA/2010/Zoid. Interestingly, strain HUN/2012/8 was distantly related to all other canine AstVs and it was grouped with AstVs identified in minks and in Californian sea lions. The unique evolutionary relationship of this canine strain was confirmed in the ORF2 (capsid)-based tree (Fig. 3C). This gene is considered as the fundamental target for classification and characterization of AstVs. When observing in detail the large monophyletic group of canine AstVs which classified into species 5 (Schultz-Cherry, 2013), it was possible to identify clearly sub-clustering patterns, with at least 6 sub-clusters. All Chinese strains, the UK strain GBR/2014/Lincoln and the Hungarian strains HUN/2012/2 and HUN/2012/135 formed a unique group, with more than 91% nt identity in the full-length ORF2. A second group included three Italian strains (ITA/2005-3, ITA/2005-6, and ITA/2005-8), the UK strain GBR/2014/Gillingham and strain HUN/2012/6, with more than 91% nt identity to each other. A third group encompassed the virulent strain ITA/2010/Zoid and strain HUN/2012/126 (97% nt identity to each other). Other canine strains (GBR/2014/Braintree, GBR/2014/Huntingdon, HUN/2012/115) were intermingled between these three main sequence groups and, as supported by sequence comparison (Table 3), they clearly appeared as distinct genetic sub-lineages.",

            "text": "AstVs have been reported repeatedly in dogs across the world, although the association with the disease, prevalence rates and information on the genetic diversity are still largely unknown. In this study, we could neither confirm nor refute an association between AstV infection and diarrhea in dogs. Furthermore, we observed discrepancies between results obtained by the pan-astrovirus PCR assay and those derived from viral metagenomics. However, none of these methods were developed for routine diagnostic procedures and we do not have information about the actual sensitivity of these assays. At present it seems more appropriate to consider these methods, originally developed to detect viral diversity, as independent approaches that help understand the viral community and diversity in clinical/pathological specimens. Thus, our prevalence data for AstV must be interpreted with caution, even if the detection rates of AstVs fell in the ranges reported in the literature. For example, canine AstV RNA has been detected in 6\u201327% of dogs with enteritis and 0\u201319% of aysmptomatic dogs in studies in Italy (Martella et al., 2011a, Martella et al., 2011b), China (Zhu et al., 2011), Japan (Takano et al., 2015), France (Grellet et al., 2012) and UK (Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015). Even if those studies differed in the number, provenience and age of the animals enrolled in the investigations, in most studies the detection rates were found to differ significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs, suggesting a possible role of AstVs as enteric pathogens of dogs. Also, the onset and evolution of the clinical signs have been found to correlate with the patterns of virus shedding and with seroconversion in two dogs naturally infected by canine AstVs (Martella et al., 2012). Yet, experimental studies will be needed to demonstrate firmly the association of canine AstVs with gastroenteritis.",

Weak antigenic cross-reactivity has been observed in immune electron microscopy between strain ITA/2008/Bari and ITA/2010/Zoid virus particles and the sera of convalescent dogs (Martella et al., 2012). However, isolation in vitro of these viruses is fastidious and only one strain, ITA/208/Bari, has been adapted to grow in vitro thus far (Martella et al., 2011a, Martella et al., 2011b), thus hampering a precise evaluation of the antigenic relationships among different canine AstVs.",

Also, this strain markedly varied from all the other canine AstVs in the highly conserved promoter region for synthesis of subgenomic RNA, located upstream of the ORF2 (Walter and Mitchell, 2003, Mendez et al., 2014). Conversely, all other canine AstVs analysed in this study displayed a conserved genomic architecture, which was shared with all currently canine AstVs for whom the complete or partial (ORF1b and ORF2) genome sequence is available (Martella et al., 2011a, Martella et al., 2011b, Martella et al., 2012, Takano et al., 2015). In addition, upon sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, strain HUN/2012/8 differed markedly from other canine AstVs concerning the partial ORF1b and the full-length ORF2 (Table 3). According to the 9th ICTV report (http://talk.ictvonline.org/files/ictv_official_taxonomy_updates_since_the_8th_report/m/vertebrate-official/4178), for MAstVs the mean aa genetic distances (p-dist) range from 0.378 to 0.750%, and from 0.006 to 0.312%, respectively, between and within groups (species). Using our set of ORF2 sequences, the p-dist of strain HUN/2012/8 was calculated to range between 0.350 and 0.772. Accordingly, this strain appears distantly related from any other known mammalian AstV and may represent a novel AstV species.",

Although AstVs are regarded as viruses with a robust host-species restriction, several pieces of evidences in mammals (including humans) indicate that the host species barrier may be permeable in some occasions, and that heterologous viruses may stably adapt to the new host (Finkbeiner et al., 2008, Finkbeiner et al., 2009, Nagai et al., 2015). Moreover, occasional transmission of AstVs is thought to have occurred between avian and mammalian species in both directions (Sun et al., 2014, Pankovics et al., 2015).",

Nonetheless, the genetic heterogeneity among circulating AstV strains is evident representing some challenge for laboratory diagnosis. This diversity may also be challenging for future prophylaxis strategies, complicating the design of future vaccines, as it is currently unknown whether antigenic cross-reaction exists among and cross-protection is elicited by different canine AstV strains. Further efforts are needed to better understand the biology of canine AstVs and large-scale structured surveillance programs should be initiated to elucidate the relative veterinary importance of various canine AstV types.",
