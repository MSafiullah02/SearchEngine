ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein and contains a catalytically active ectodomain that can be shed from the cell surface into the extracellular space, via cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17). ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous d-glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance.

Specificity can also be assessed, and in this regard we have used the ACE inhibitor captopril. At concentrations of human and mouse rACE2 ranging from 0 to 400 ng/ml, ACE2 enzymatic activity (measured after 16 h) is not blocked by captopril (10 \u22125 M) (Fig. 2) . Indeed, as an internal control, one may add captopril (10 \u22125 M) or another ACE inhibitor to each reaction well (as a component of the assay buffer) in the ACE2 assay. Both MLN-4760 and DX600 strongly inhibit the activity of human rACE2 over a wide range of concentrations of the recombinant enzyme (1.56-400 ng/ml), with the degree of inhibition ranging from 74.5 to 99.0 % for MLN-4760, and from 62.2 to 100 % for DX600 (Fig. 2a) .

DX600 exerts no inhibitory effect on mouse rACE2 activity in this assay. Indeed, DX600 (10 \u22126 M) actually enhanced RFU at lower levels of mouse rACE2 (3.13-50 ng/ml). In this regard, Pedersen et al. [16] measured the dissociation constant (Ki) between DX600 and human or mouse ACE2 in activity assays with the same ACE2 substrate, and reported the Ki for human ACE2 to be significantly lower (0.040 \u00b1 0.005 \u03bcM) than the Ki for mouse ACE2 (0.36 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM), suggesting that DX600 has higher affinity for human ACE2. The inhibitory effect of another commercially available conformational variant of DX600 (cyclic form) on ACE2 has not yet been tested in our assay. However, Ye et al. have reported that the disulfide bridged cyclic variant of DX600 (Bachem) had no inhibitory effect The inter-assay CV is calculated for each sample by dividing the standard deviation of six measurements by the mean ACE2 activity of six measurements on mouse or rat ACE2, even at high concentrations, but effectively inhibited human rACE2 [17] . We have also examined the dose-dependent effects of MLN-4760 and DX600 (linear form) on ACE2 activity (measured at 16 h), using mouse rACE2 at concentrations from 0 to 50 ng/ml. An increase in MLN-4760 concentration from 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22125 M does not significantly enhance the assay characteristics (97.1-100 % inhibition for 10 \u22125 M, 95.0-99.3 % for 10 \u22126 M). Indeed, a highly linear relationship between the ACE2 activity (RFU) and mouse rACE2 concentration is observed for both concentrations of MLN-4760 (R 2 = 0.9950, p < 0.001 for 10 \u22125 M; R 2 = 0.9954, p < 0.001 for 10 \u22126 M). In contrast, DX600 has no significant inhibitory effect on mouse rACE2 activity even at concentrations as high as 10 \u22125 M. Similarly, two groups have reported that 10 \u22126 M DX600 only partly (and ineffectively) blocks mouse recombinant or mouse kidney ACE2 activity [16, 17] . However, significant inhibition of mouse ACE2 has been observed with DX600 at 10 \u22125 M using an assay buffer maintained at pH 6.5 (16) . In rat PT segments, we have used the linear form of DX600 (10 \u22126 M) (obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) to demonstrate inhibition of Ang-(1-7) formation from Ang-(1-10), suggesting inhibition of rat ACE2 [5] . In rat kidney cortex, Ye et al. showed that DX600 (10 \u22126 M) only partly inhibited ACE2 activity, measured at pH 6.5 [17] . Accordingly, because of the relatively poor inhibition of rodent ACE2 by DX600, for mouse biological samples we use 10 \u22126 M of MLN-4760 for all experiments.
