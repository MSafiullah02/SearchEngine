Generally speaking, burnout is defined as a lack of engagement with one\u2019s job (e.g., exhaustion, cynicism, and diminished confidence in one\u2019s performance; Schaufeli et al. 1996). Given that resilience is related to burnout in high-intensity nursing specialties (Rushton et al. 2015), fostering resilience is one way to help nursing students manage their stress through positive adaptive coping techniques (Reeve et al. 2013; Sanderson and Brewer 2017).",

According to this \u201cPushing Through\u201d model of resilience, there are three phases that exemplify how resilience is experienced: first, \u2018stepping into\u2019, or embracing, the adversity. Second, \u2018staying the course\u2019, or being aware they must continue pursuing their goals. Last, \u2018acknowledging\u2019 that they have learned from their adversity and felt ready to meet another challenge. Students also experienced temporary setbacks such as \u2018disengaging\u2019 from school because they felt overwhelmed. This model acts as a lens to explain how resilience can be fostered over time despite periods of adversity. Given evidence that resilience is related to burnout in nursing students (R\u00edos-Risquez et al. 2016), there is preliminary support for promoting resilience in nursing students before they enter their careers.",

Interventions aimed at fostering resilience have been identified as important for both employee and organizational wellbeing (see Robertson, Cooper, Sarkar, & Curran, 2015 for review). Thus, resilience interventions could be especially valuable for young nurses who are less likely to use positive coping strategies (McGarry et al. 2013) and are higher risk for poor retention (Clendon and Walker 2012). This is especially valuable because nursing is predicted to experience high job growth in the U.S. by 2026 (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017), though there will be a worldwide nurse shortage through 2025 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014).",

Previous interventions have found positive effects for physicians and nurses (Potter et al. 2013; Sood et al. 2011), but few have focused on nursing students (Reyes et al. 2015). Finally, few healthcare interventions have actually measured resilience using the CD-RISC, a suitable measure for assessing participants\u2019 responses to an intervention (Connor and Davidson 2003).Hypothesis 1 (H1): Resilience will be higher in the intervention group than the control group after the intervention.Hypothesis 2a-c (H2a-c): In the intervention group, (a) exhaustion and (b) cynicism will decrease after the intervention; (c) professional efficacy will increase after the intervention.Hypothesis 3 (H3): Participants will report satisfaction with the intervention.",

According to the Broaden and Build theory of positive psychology, positive emotions act as a resource to mitigate the negative effects of stress (Fredrickson and Joiner 2002). These positive emotions act as a precursor to resilience (Ong et al. 2006). Time management and communication were identified by the nursing faculty as critical needs (Altmiller 2011; Hershcovis 2011; Heslop et al. 2001; Pines et al. 2014). In Week 2, a specialist in academic success learning strategies presented on time management. Week 3 was a session on individual strengths to provide a well-rounded framework for resilience, rather than just focusing on the negative (Lester et al. 2011; Rath 2007). In Week 4, a licensed independent mental health practitioner presented on conflict management through effective communication. Given the high prevalence of burnout in nursing students (Gibbons 2010), Week 5 educated about identifying and mitigating burnout symptoms through peer support (Mathieu 2012).",

Given the small sample sizes, it is possible that this study didn\u2019t have enough power to detect significant effects. However, given the small sample size in this study, non-parametric tests are considered a valid alternative for hypothesis testing (Whitley and Ball 2002). Further, similar interventions have been conducted with smaller sample sizes and without a control group (Potter et al. 2013; van der Riet et al. 2015). This study is therefore a unique contribution to the literature. Participants were recruited voluntarily, and it is possible that those who were interested in a resilience intervention were more burnt out than those who did not participate. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups, which is one method of avoiding selection effects within experiments (i.e., both groups were equally resilient and burned out before the intervention). Further, there was only a 47% participation rate in this study. Previous research has found that response rates range from 35.7% \u2013 52.7% depending on the sample (Baruch and Holtom 2008). However, this study provided advance notice and monetary compensation, both of which are effective ways to recruit participants and reduce attrition (Anseel et al. 2010; Robinson et al. 2015). Finally, this small sample of nursing students may not generalize to other programs in other states.",

Providing nursing students with exposure to realistic scenarios in a simulation allows them to effectively practice their skills (Aebersold and Tschannen 2013; Robertson et al. 2015). For example participants could act out a scenario where a coworker is rude to them, and practice an appropriate response. Furthermore, outcomes like patient satisfaction (Kim et al. 2004) and patient outcomes should be explored. At an individual level, promoting resilience may produce better patient outcomes. Incorporating positive coping strategies and other resilience techniques may improve patient handoffs (Drach-Zahavy et al. 2015).",
