Such predetermined selection rules are brittle as they cannot identify the important context words for ED in all the possible sentences for event mentions. For instance, the entity mention rule would not be able to select the import words \"for\", \"better\" and \"job\" in S2 as these words are not parts of any entity mentions (assuming the entity mentions defined in ACE 2005). Similarly, the dependency rule would be incapable of directly taking the important words \"go\" and \"home\" in S3 as they are far apart from \"leave\" in the dependency tree of S3. It would be desirable if the context word selection strategies can be customized for each input sentence and its event trigger candidate so the most effective context words for each trigger candidate can be revealed and modeled.",

At each step, the next important word for the event prediction would be chosen from the sentence, conditioned on the words that have been previously selected. Such selected words would be composed in the end to produce the feature representation for our ED problem. In particular, along the word selection sequence, a representation vector is maintained to encode the information for the words chosen up to the current step. The representation vector is first set to the representation of the trigger word candidate obtained from an LSTM model. At each step, the current representation vector is used as the query to compute a relevance/importance score for each of the non-selected words and the word with the highest relevance score would be chosen to incorporate into the current representation vector via a composition function. After some selection steps, the final representation vector would be utilized as the features to make prediction for ED. In this way, the model is trained to automatically identify important words in a given input sentence for ED, potentially leading to better relevant word choices to improve ED performance.",

In particular, for the input sentence W , we perform a sequence of word selections where the most relevant word is selected at each step, conditioning on the chosen words in the previous steps. At the selection step i, denote v i as the overall representation vector to accumulate the information about the selected words up to the current step. Also, let G i = w i 1 , w i 2 , . . . , w i Ni be the list of words that have not been selected so far in the input sentence W (i.e., the non-selected words) (N i is the number of words in G i : At the initial selection step i = 1, the representation vector v 1 is set to the hidden vector of the anchor word obtained from the bidirectional LSTM network (i.e., v 1 = h a ). This assignment emphasizes the intuition that the anchor word w a is the most important word in the sentence for ED and it should be selected first to guide the relevant word selections in the next steps. The nonselected words at the initial step thus belong to the set",

            "text": "Selecting the Relevant Word. Given the relevance score r(w i j ) for each word w i j \u2208 G i , an obvious way to select a relevant word for step i + 1 is to take the word w i di with the highest score, i.e., d i = argmax j r(w i j ). However, this obvious approach would cause a problem to train the whole model as the variable d i to specify the index of the word chosen at step i is discrete and non-differential, blocking the back-propagation via d i during training. In order to avoid this problem, we seek to approximate the argmax operation by using the relevance scores of the words in G i to form a categorical distribution over G i from which a word from G i is sampled and chosen as the next relevant word. Two requirements arise when we apply this approximation approach: (i) an efficient method to sample from the categorical distribution over G i , and (ii) a mechanism to allow the model to be trained with the discrete sample from G i . In this work, we apply the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax (STGS) estimator proposed in [10, 17] to satisfy these requirements. In particular, in STGS, the relevance scores r(w i j ) (j = 1 . . . N i ) would be transformed into the Gumbel-Softmax distribution (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y Ni ) over G i via the following softmax function (y j represents the probability that the word w i j \u2208 G i is selected):",

The first benefit of STGS with the Gumbel noise g j is that it allows efficient sampling from the categorical distribution (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y Ni ). Specifically, in order to sample an index d i for the words in G i from this distribution, ones only need to perform the argmax function: d i = argmax j y j [8, 17] .

The second benefit of STGS is that the model can use the sampled value of d i directly by allowing the training process to take different paths in the forward and backward computation. In particular, the forward phase would compute the values of v i+1 and c i+1 via the sampled value of d i . In contrast, the backward phase would treat v i+1 as the weighted sum of cm(u i j , v i , c i ) (j = 1, . . . , N i ) with (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y Ni ) as the weights and directly use m i+1 j as the cell states for each word w i j \u2208 G i .

The most important observation from the table is that the proposed model LearnToSelectED significantly outperforms all the compared methods in this work. In particular, although LearnToSelect is only trained on the ACE 2005 training dataset, is also better than the other methods that utilize additional data for training (i.e., DM-CNN+, FrameNet and MultiAtt) (an improvement of 2.8% over the best data-augmented method MultiAtt [14] ). Comparing LearnToSelectED with the other methods that explicitly select the relevant context words for ED via fixed strategies (e.g., NCNN, SupervisedAtt, GCNN-ENT), we see that Learn-ToSelectED has significantly better performance (an improvement of 2.1% absolute F1 score over the best model GCNN-ENT of this type). This testifies to the effectiveness of the automatic identification of important context words for ED in this work.

            "text": "There are two important components for the operation of the LearnToSe-lectED model, i.e., the function cm to compose the overall representation vector v i and word representation u i j in Sect. 2.2 based on the LSTM unit (called LSTM-Compose), and the procedure to select relevant words in Sect. 2.2 with the STGS estimator (called LearnSelection). We write LearnToSelectED = LSTM-Compose + LearnSelection to summarize the main components in LearnToSelectED. This section aims to demonstrate the importance of these two components for LearnToSelectED in this work. In particular, we try different variations of these two components to see how well they compare with LearnToSelectED. For the LSTM-Compose component, an alternative, called RNN-Compose is to avoid the gating mechanisms in cm and only use a simple feed-forward network to transform the concatenation of v i and u i j into a new vector as in vanilla RNN units. Regarding the LearnSelection component, the possible variations include the fixed strategies to select important words for ED motivated from the previous work. Specifically, we consider the following fixed strategies for important word selection in this section: 1) All: selecting all the words in the sentences, 2) Entity: selecting the words within the entity mentions of the sentences, motivated by [16] , 3) Syntax: selecting the words surrounding the anchor words in the dependency trees, motivated by [27] , 4) Entity-Syntax: selecting the words in the unions of those for Entity and Syntax [27] , and 5) Window: selecting the adjacent words in a window of size win of the anchor words. The best value of win we find via the ACE 2005 development dataset for this variation is win = 5. Note that once a set of words is selected according to one of those five strategies, we perform the composition function cm over these words from left to right, keeping their natural order in the sentences. The anchor words are always used to initialize the process. Table 3 presents the performance of LearnToSelectED on the ACE 2005 development dataset when its components are replaced by the variations.",

However, once they are combined (i.e., Enity-Syntax) as in [27] , the performance becomes much better, (iv) Window has better performance than Entity and Syntax, but it is not enough to produce the best performance, and (v) most importantly, LearnSelection significantly outperforms its five variations with p < 0.05, eventually demonstrating the effectiveness of LearnSelection for ED.",

Recently, a greater attention has been put on deep learning where various networks are proposed to solve ED. The typical network components include CNN [1, 2, 23, 25] , RNN [22, 28] , attention mechanisms [14, 16, 20] , syntactic structures [27, 31] , Generative Adversarial Networks [9] and document-level representation [3] .
