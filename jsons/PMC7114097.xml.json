Outbreaks of turkey poult enteritis associated with TCoV have caused severe economical losses in the turkey industry in Indiana, North Carolina, and other states for the last several years. Although the economical importance of this disease has been recognized for decades, the organization of genomic structure of TCoV is poorly understood and reports regarding the relationships of TCoV with other coronaviruses remained controversial (Van Regenmortel et al., 2000, Gonzalez et al., 2003).",

The diameter of coronaviral particles are around 140\u2013150 nm. The coronavirus genome is a positive single-stranded capped RNA with a polyadenylated 3\u2032 end. Complete genomic RNA sequences of coronaviruses has been determined for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; 27,569 nucleotides; Boursnell et al., 1987), murine hepatitis virus (MHV; 31,092 nucleotides; Lee et al., 1991), human coronavirus (HCoV) strain 229E (27,277 nucleotides; Herold et al., 1993), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; 28,579 nucleotides; Eleouet et al., 1995, Penzes et al., 2001). The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the coronavirus genome, approximately 20 kb, consists of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that encode non-structural proteins including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and proteases. Another one-third nucleotide sequences from 3\u2032 end contain ORFs encode the major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the order of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 along the genome, respectively.",

This unique antigenicity was questioned when the close relationship between TCoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was demonstrated in a series of antigenic studies (Dea et al., 1990) and by sequence analysis of TCoV M and N genes (Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991). In contrast, recent antigenic (Guy et al., 1997, Loa et al., 2000) and genomic (Breslin et al., 1999a, Breslin et al., 1999b; Akin et al., 2001, Cavanagh et al., 2001, Cavanagh et al., 2002, Lin et al., 2002) analysis of TCoV, however, demonstrated that TCoV and IBV, two avian coronaviruses, are closely related. The causes for these discrepant results regarding the relationships of TCoV with BCoV or IBV remained unclear. Further analysis of genomic structure of TCoV is important to clarify this enigma. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to determine the sequences of the 3\u2032 end coding region for structural protein genes of TCoV.",

The number, nucleotide sequence, and gene order of these ORFs varied remarkably among different coronaviruses. It is speculated that these genes were inserted into different sites in the coronavirus genomes due to the RNA recombination-prone discontinuous transcription mechanism and were not essential for virus replication and pathogenesis. However, sequence analysis in the present study indicated that both nucleotide sequences and locations of these ORFs and their consensus TRS of TCoV are highly conserved with those of IBV. Given such a highly conserved sequences and structures within avian coronaviruses, genes 3 and 5 may play important roles in coronavirus pathogenesis to avian species.",

            "text": "One of the characteristic features for coronavirus replication is the synthesis of a 3\u2032 coterminal nested set of polycistronic subgenomic mRNAs by a discontinuous transcription mechanism. Several conserved TRS have been identified for different coronavirus proximal to the initiation codon of the first ORF for each particular subgenomic mRNA. The consensus sequences of the TRS sites are CT(T/G)AACAA for IBV, ATC(T/C)AAAC for BCoV, AACTAAAC for TGEV, AATC(T/C)A(A/T)AC for MHV, and AACTAAAC for FIPV (Spaan et al., 1988, Stirrups et al., 2000). The distance between the TRS and the first ORF is different for each subgenomic mRNA of different coronaviruses. Both the nucleotide sequence of TRS and the distance between the TRS 3\u2032 end and the initiation codon of first ORF are suggested to play important role in the transcription of mRNAs. As shown in the present study, the TRS sequences of TCoV were found highly conserved with those of the corresponding genes of IBV except one nucleotide substitution in that of gene 3. The TRS of gene 3 is ATGAACAA for TCoV and CTGAACAA for IBV. The distances between TRS and initiation codon of S gene, gene 3, gene 5, and N gene of TCoV were all the same as those of IBV while the distances for TCoV or IBV M gene are 74 or 77, respectively. The highly conserved sequences and structures of TRS between TCoV and IBV provide further evidence that these two avian coronaviruses share close evolutionary relationship. These highly conserved TRS sequences of IBV has been shown to be recombination \u201chot spot\u201d and may serve as the template switching sites for the viral encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Lee and Jackwood, 2000). These recombination events play important role to the emergence of new IBV variants responsible for continuous outbreaks in the chicken flocks vaccinated with live attenuated viruses due to failure of cross protection. It is possible that the similar recombination events of IBV in chicken may contribute to the origin and evolution of TCoV in turkey and merit further investigation.",

The similarity of S protein sequences between TCoV in the present study and IBV strains (33.8\u201333.9%) is much lower than that among IBV strains (83.2\u201394.0%). The difference of nucleotide between TCoV in the present study and IBV seems to be randomly distributed throughout the entire S gene except a stretch of 225 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end that shared high similarity (88.9%) with the corresponding sequences of IBV. These observations suggested that cross-over homologous recombination, very likely by a template switching mechanism, occurred around the consensus TRS site of S gene and within the 3\u2032 end 225 nucleotides region (involving the TRS site of gene 3) and resulted in a whole new codon reading frame for S protein of TCoV with conserved TRS and other genomic structure features of IBV. Spike protein of coronaviruses has been well known as the major structural protein responsible for attachment, fusion, and penetration of virions to the target cells. The substantial difference of S protein gene between TCoV and IBV well explains the different host tropism and different tissue pathogenicity of these two avian coronaviruses. Turkey coronavirus is associated with enteric disease of turkey while IBV is usually associated with respiratory disease in chicken.",

On the other hand, the difference of S protein gene between TCoV in the present study and IBV is substantial.
