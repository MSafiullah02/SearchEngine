However, census data show that the percentage of the population who are aged 65 or above will increase from 11% in 2001 to 24% in 2031, which is a net increase of 1.35 million (Census and Statistics Department, 2001). This increase will result in an enormous expansion of the high-risk elderly group. Since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian influenza outbreaks in 2003\u20132004, the Hong Kong government has encouraged the elderly people to undergo influenza vaccination. Since 1998, it has provided free influenza immunization to the institutional elderly people, but not to those who are not institutionalized (Department of Health, 2004). Among the former, the vaccination rate is reported to be more than 87% (Department of Health, 2007), whereas among the latter it is only 32.2% (Lau et al., 2006). Among the non-institutionalized population as a whole, it is a mere 2.3% (Hui, 2004). This shows that a large proportion of Hong Kong's population does not undergo influenza vaccination.",

An exploration of the factors that are related to influenza vaccination among such populations will help to identify ways to improve the vaccination rate among the Chinese elderly people. Previous studies have found that the important correlates of vaccination in the elderly people include perceived good health (Evans and Watson, 2003), a history of chronic illness (Mok et al., 2006), perceived efficacy of vaccination (Lau et al., 2007), previous experience of vaccination (Mok et al., 2006, Telford and Rogers, 2003), recommendations by healthcare professionals (Evans and Watson, 2003; Zimmerman et al., 2003b), and the side-effect profile of vaccination and perceived susceptibility to influenza (Mok et al., 2006, Telford and Rogers, 2003).",

A number of researchers, however, have proposed the use of a combination of subjective and objective investigations in a single study to elicit more information from different angles and of a different nature. Functional limitations (Zimmerman et al., 2003a) and cognitive impairment (Landi et al., 2005), for example, are associated with a lower likelihood of the intention to seek vaccination. Although there are a few studies of the functional or cognitive status responses to influenza vaccination among Caucasian populations in temperate regions, there is a paucity of such information among Chinese populations. To address these issues, we thus seek to answer the following research questions.1.What is the prevalence of vaccination among the Hong Kong Chinese elderly people?2.What are the correlates that affect influenza vaccination among this elderly population?3.Are there any differences in attitudes toward influenza vaccination among Hong Kong elderly people with different levels of cognitive and physical functioning?\n",

NECs provide community support services at the neighborhood level to enable the elderly people to remain in the community, to enhance their positive contributory role in the community and to involve the public in creating a caring community. They provide a range of comprehensive services to cater for the psycho-social needs of both healthy and mildly frail elderly people, including the provision of health education. S/Es organize indoor and outdoor social and recreational activities for the elderly people in the community, provide information on welfare services, and make referrals to appropriate services and/or organizations. Any elderly person aged 60 or above who lives in the locality can take part in the activities offered by the NECs and S/Es by paying an annual membership fee (Social Welfare Department, 2005).",

It has also been used as a research tool to screen for cognitive disorders in epidemiological studies and to follow cognitive change in clinical trials. The MMSE is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function \u2013 orientation, attention and calculation, immediate and short-term recall, language, and the ability to follow simple verbal and written commands \u2013 thus providing a total score that allows quantitative assessment. The maximum total score is 30. The CMMSE, which is the Chinese version of the MMSE (Chiu et al., 1994), has been found to have good reliability and satisfactory discriminate validity as an instrument for detecting cognitive impairment in Hong Kong. Cutoffs of 18/19 and 24/25 have yielded satisfactory sensitivity and specificity according to the DSM III-R criteria (Chiu et al., 1994) and were thus adopted in the current study. Scores of 25\u201330 out of 30 are considered to be normal, scores of 19\u201324 indicate mild to moderate impairment, and scores of 18 or less indicate severe impairment (Crum et al., 1993).",

It is one of the standard measuring devices for functional disability and has been shown to have satisfactory reliability (Collin et al., 1988) and good validity (Shah and Cooper, 1993). The 10 items that relate to self-care ability, continence and mobility are scored by determining the subject's level of independence (i.e., whether he or she can perform the activity in question independently, with assistance or supervision, or not at all). The scores for each item are then summed up to give a total score that ranges from 0 (complete dependence in ADL) to 100 (complete independence) and represents the subject's functional capacity. Granger et al. (1979) found that 60 is the pivotal score at which clients move from assisted independence to dependence and that 80 is the optimal cutoff score for self-reported dependency (Kay et al., 1997). The overall results of the current study are thus grouped into three dependency categories: (a) \u226460, (b) 61\u201380 and (c) 81\u2013100.

U.S. health authorities have pointed out that the target vaccination rate for people aged 65 or above is 90% (Singleton et al., 2000); thus, there is a need to increase vaccination coverage in Hong Kong, especially in the hospital setting, as elderly hospital patients are a highly vulnerable group and perhaps the one that would benefit most from vaccination. A strategic promotion program designed to enhance the acceptance of influenza vaccination should be implemented. A recent local study found that the prevalence of influenza vaccination and its relevant perceptions in the elderly population would continue to change over time (Lau et al., 2007). However, the prevalence was found in only 15 out of the 174 centers therefore it would limit the generalizability of the results in Hong Kong. Therefore, continuing studies are warranted to further investigate the prevalence of such vaccination.",

Another possible explanation is that the elderly people who visit such centers are more receptive to and more likely to adapt to current societal changes (Aranceta et al., 2001). It may therefore be logical to suggest that the elderly participants in this study, all of whom visit these centers, were similarly open-minded about and more ready to accept preventive medicine. The organization of regular health promotion activities by the centers may also have heightened their awareness of their own health, and the rapport established with the nursing staff may have made the vaccination advice offered more convincing.

This effect appears to be even stronger among Chinese people, largely because the family is the center of the universe in Chinese culture, and thus family influence is huge (Smith, 1991). From another angle, earlier studies have noted that family experiences of having and preventing influenza are as important as personal experiences in determining elderly people's acceptance or rejection of influenza vaccination (Telford and Rogers, 2003). Therefore, the promotion of such vaccination among elderly people should involve family and friends.",

In the current study, most of the participants were retired and had no reliable regular income, thus placing them in the group vulnerable to poverty. Except for a minority who were in receipt of CSSA, these elderly people would be charged at least HK$50 (\u223cUS$7) of their scanty income for vaccination; thus, many of them said they had chosen to forgo it for financial reasons. The Hong Kong SAR Government's current policy primarily provides free vaccination to the institutionalized elderly people and those with chronic illness, thus excluding most of the non-institutionalized elderly people. Our findings suggest the need for extending free influenza vaccination to all persons in Hong Kong who are aged 65 or above, thus easing the financial constraints of this disadvantaged group and most likely dramatically increasing the vaccination rate among it.",

In terms of methodology, the main limitations are the use of convenience sampling and the cross-sectional design, which may have resulted in the identification of associations between vaccination and some of the variables that may not be causal. Generalizing the results of this study would therefore require further longitudinal research using probability sampling. Another limitation is that the majority of the elderly participants had good cognitive and physical status; thus, it is difficult to elucidate the true correlation between this variable and having undergone vaccination. In addition, only 15 out of the 174 centers agreed to participate in this study, which limit the generalizability of the results to general populations of elderly people in Hong Kong.",

Therefore, the implementation of an influenza vaccination program is recommended for the population at large or at least for high-risk populations. Governments can successfully promote vaccination by educating the public about its advantages, through encouragement by nursing and other medical staff at centers for the elderly people, as well as family and friends, by making known the locations at which vaccination is available, and by making it accessible to everyone. In addition, the influence of the SARS and avian influenza outbreaks in Hong Kong has not only raised health awareness among the elderly people, but it has also revolutionized their attitudes toward influenza vaccination. Free vaccination and a consideration of vaccination in the following year are also correlated with vaccination among this population. Furthermore, although the levels of cognitive and physical functioning among the elderly participants in this study did not affect their decision to seek influenza vaccination in a statistically significant manner, further exploratory studies should be undertaken to raise awareness of the importance of a combination of subjective and objective assessments of vaccination.",
