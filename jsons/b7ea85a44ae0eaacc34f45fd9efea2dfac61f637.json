This declaration mandated the reduction of social and recreational gatherings, closure of large, indoor shopping malls, cancellation of classes at all schools and directed all non-essential workers to work from home. 8 The response to the pandemic has involved health care system administrators, clinicians, laboratory researchers, and government officials, addressing a wide range of needs from personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care providers, ventilators for patients and intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability to testing of treatment approaches, development and distribution of diagnostic tests to the search for an effective vaccine. At the same time, governmental officials and media have been communicating information on the status of the pandemic globally and locally, conveying epidemiological reports, guidelines for preventing infection and providing information on the capacity of the health care system to meet the demands of patients with COVID-19.",

A large number of respondents received information through electronic media, family members and friends indicating that traditional forms of electronic media (e.g. TV) and communications through family and friend networks remain the primary information sources and channels for public health messages. Noticeably, over 80% of participants accessed information about COVID-19 via social media. Social media have increasingly become an important source of information and an inexpensive communication medium that allows health agencies to quickly disseminate their messages to potentially large audiences.15  The study findings suggest that public health and government agencies should take advantage of social media outlets to convey public health communications and information about COVID-19 to the population. However, it is essential that the information is endorsed and approved by technical agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) before the information is posted. Social media can cause confusion if the information is not accurate and credible. A recent study in the U.S. and UK found that while participants generally had good knowledge of the main COVID-19 transmission modes and common symptoms, they reported misconceptions on COVID-19 prevention derived from social media, including discrimination against individuals of East Asian ethnicity because they might spread COVID-19. 11",
