Specifically, peripheral inflammation can profoundly impair the central nervous system (CNS) cognition through the compromised BBB [10]. It was well recognized that the most closely related to neurocognition region is in the hippocampal substructure: the CA1 area and the dentate gyrus [11]. Montagne et al. suggested that BBB breakdown in the hippocampus is an early event in the aging human brain that may contribute to cognitive impairment [12]. In light of these findings, it was surmised that hypercapnia can further enhance the BBB permeability which would result in aggravating the cognitive dysfunction in hypoxemia. However, detailed mechanisms involved in hypercapnia-induced BBB disruption in hypoxemia have remained to be elucidated.",

They are closely related to the BBB permeability through their end-feet which express Aquaporins-4 (AQP-4) [14\u201317]. In the hypoxic rat model, the BBB is compromised due to the upregulation of AQP-4 expression in the astrocytes [17]. Hypoxemia in combination with hypercapnia can further increase the BBB permeability through up-regulation of AQP-4 expression in the rat model [18]. The tight junction proteins (TJPs) which mainly include claudin, occludin, and zonula protein maintain the BBB normal function. Being the most redox-sensitive part of the TJPs, degradation of the occludin and claudin-5 primarily accounts for the increased BBB permeability in hypoxemia [19, 20]. It is well recognized that the degradation of TJPs is by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), of which matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is mainly localized in the astrocytes [21]. In hypoxic newborn pigs during resuscitation, hypercapnia can further induce production of MMPs in the ventricles [22]. Hence, under the condition of hypoxemia, hypercapnia may also promote the production of MMP-9 in the CNS.",

In hypoxemia, HIF-1\u03b1 firstly stabilizes in the cytoplasm and then translocates from cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it dimerizes with HIF-1\u03b2 [24]. The HIF-1 heterodimer binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE), where it modulates the transcription of a host of targets against hypoxic conditions [24]. The previous study has demonstrated that MMP-9 and AQP-4 could be up-regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 in the CNS [25, 26]. Furthermore, MMP-9 and AQP-4 expression could be further up-regulated by hypercapnia in hypoxemia [18, 22], but the mechanism underpinning this further up-regulation has not been established. As far as we know, oxygen (O2) consumption is accompanied by carbon dioxide (CO2) production, hypoxemia and hypercapnia may be perturbed in COPD and ARDS [27, 28]. Hence hypercapnia in combination with hypoxemia may exert different and unique molecular mechanisms unlike that when it acts alone.",

In light of the above, we hypothesized that hypercapnia may further aggravate the BBB disruption in the adult rats with hypoxemia through the HIF-1 signal pathway. Furthermore, we were interested in searching for the possible drug for ameliorating the hypercapnia-induced neurocognition dysfunction. In this context, we have focused on the drug 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), which can confer neuroprotection in the CNS disease [29]. 2ME2 is a naturally occurring derivative of estradiol and devoid of estrogenic activity [30]. It is a potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent, which can tackle cancer with its antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, anti-tubulin effects [31]. Increasing evidence has shown that the role of 2ME2 on the brain physiology of non-tumor disease is mainly associated with its inhibitory effect on the HIF-1\u03b1 expression [29].",

We examined the relationship of hypercapnia, the HIF-1 signal pathway and the HIF-1 target gene (MMP-9 and AQP-4) in the rat model of hypercapnia given 2ME2 pretreatment. We report here that, under the condition of hypoxemia, hypercapnia may promote HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear translocation and induce over-expression of MMP-9 and AQP-4 in the astrocytes which ultimately would lead to disruption of the BBB integrity.",

After this, the rats were ventilated for 3 h through an animal ventilator (SAR-1000, CWE, Ardmore, PA, USA). The rat model of hypoxemia/hypercapnia that we have previously established [7] suggests that the indicators of blood gas analysis (pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, and oxygen partial pressure) of SD rats are most stable at 3 h. Therefore, in addition to cognitive impairment, other indicators were acquired at 3 h. The details of the hypoxemic/hypercapnic rat model were described in our previous study [7].",

This is consistent with the clinical scenarios of COPD and ARDS. In agreement with our previous study [7], we confirmed here that hypercapnia alone did not sufficiently lead to cognitive dysfunction, but it significantly aggravated the cognitive dysfunction when applied in combination with hypoxemia.

Previous studies have indicated that disruption of the BBB is closely related with the cognitive dysfunction [8, 9]. Furthermore, a recent study has reported that the BBB breakdown in the hippocampus may contribute to the cognitive impairment [12]. In the hypoxic-ischemic models of rats, the BBB integrity was impaired [34, 35]. Hence, we have shown that the BBB permeability was enhanced 3 h after hypoxemic insult in the hypoxemia group. More importantly, hypercapnia can further increase the BBB permeability in the hypercapnia + hypoxemia group. Very interestingly, when the acidosis was neutralized by the tris-base, the further enhanced BBB permeability could not be restored. Taken together, we speculate that hypercapnia may aggravate the cognitive dysfunction through further disruption of the BBB integrity in the hypoxemic hippocampus of rats independently of acidosis.",

First of all, with the AQP-4 protein in astrocytes being up-regulated, the BBB permeability was enhanced [36, 37]. Secondly, being the most important part of the TJPS, the decrease in the occludin and claudin-5 represents the enhanced permeability of the BBB [19, 20]. Under the hypoxic-ischemic conditions, occludin and claudin-5 can be degraded by MMP-9 released from the astrocytes in the brain [38, 39]. Furthermore, MMP-9 and AQP-4 can be regulated by the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Previous studies had demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of HIF-1\u03b1 could induce the up-regulation of the MMP-9 and AQP-4 proteins which would eventually disrupt the BBB integrity [25, 26]. Consistent with this, we had found that 3 h after hypoxemic insult, the MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein expression was increased with a concomitant up-regulation of the total and nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein in the H group. Additionally, we have found that hypercapnia alone did not affect the total and nuclear HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein production in the astrocytes in the hippocampus. However, in comparison with the hypoxemia group, hypercapnia can induce an increase in nuclear HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein production in hypercapnia + hypoxemia group. Following 2ME2 pretreatment, nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein in the astrocytes was decreased in comparison with the hypercapnia + hypoxemia group.",

It is documented that 2ME2 is a potent anticancer drug and that it is not a specific inhibitor for HIF-1a [29]. 2ME2 mainly exerts its physiological effects through vasodilatory, pro-apoptotic, tubulin-binding activity in cancer diseases and inhibition of HIF-1a nuclear translocation in non-cancer CNS diseases [40]. The vasodilatory effect of 2ME2 is poorly explored until recently. Previous studies have shown that 2ME2 inhibits phenylephrine-induced tension in the aorta [41] and KCl-induced contraction in the coronary artery [42] through its vasodilatory effect. However, the vasodilatory effect of 2ME2 in the brain have not been explored. The pro-apoptotic effect of 2ME2 is now well-recognized 2ME2 can induce cell death in a variety of malignant cell lines [43]. Tubulin-binding activity is also an important mechanism by which 2ME2 can inhibit tubulin polymerization and induce cell death in cancer cells [44]. However, 2ME2-mediated neuroprotection as reported in this study is unlikely to result from the pro-apoptotic and tubulin-binding activity, because 2ME2 did not induce apoptosis and inhibit tubulin polymerization in normal mammalian cells [45]. Taken together, it is suggested that 2ME2 can confer neuroprotection through inhibition of HIF-1a nuclear translocation in non-cancer CNS diseases.",

It is well known that hypercapnia is generally accompanied by acidosis in vivo. Therefore, cellular effects as observed under conditions of hypercapnic acidosis could be a consequence of elevated CO2, decreased pH, or a combination of both [46]. To illustrate this, we next examined whether the pH levels would affect the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein. After neutralizing the acidosis induced by the hypercapnia through adding tris-base, we found that the effects mentioned above were not reversed. It stands to reason, therefore, that hypercapnia exerts its effect that is independent of the acidosis.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study has demonstrated unequivocally that besides hypoxemia, hypercapnia also serves as an external stimulus that can trigger the intracellular signaling molecules which affect the expression of different proteins in the CNS. In this connection, hypercapnia can facilitate the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein, and then induce MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein over-expression in the astrocytes, which would further disrupt the BBB integrity in the hypoxemic rats. It is conceivable that further disruption of the BBB would partly ascribe to the etiopathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Thus, the cascade of hypercapnia-induced nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein translocation in hypoxia-activated astrocytes may be a potential target for ameliorating cognitive impairment.",
