In Europe, the third most infected country is France (after Italy and Spain) with more than 26 000 cases and about 1500 deaths by the end of the last week of March [1]. One of the first French regions hit by the outbreak was Picardy, located at the northeast of the country. The first case in Picardy was diagnosed on February 26 th , 2020 in the Cardiac Thoracic and Respiratory ICU of the Amiens-Picardy University Hospital. The number of patients admitted to the region's ICUs rapidly increased after that first case. To tackle this surge, an organisation was set in order to coordinate and facilitate the admission of critically ill Covid-19 infected patients, and to avoid or at least delay the overrun of ICU capacities in the region. We based the organisation on a centralised on-call dispatch ICU consultant and efficient bed manager software.",

It has been packaged in a Docker image and secured using Keycloak\u00ae. The software was hosted by Amiens-Picardy University Hospital. Hence, the on-call regional intensivist dispatcher can access in real time to a synthesis of beds availability (Fig.1 ) using a web browser or a smart phone. The software was shared online by all ICUs in Picardy. It was asked for all ICUs to timely update the number of available beds. All ICUs are divided in two areas, for Covid-19 infected and non-infected patients, respectively. Hence, the on-call regional intensivist dispatcher was immediately able to find an available ICU bed for every patient in the region.",

Since the beginning of the outbreak, the team received between one1 and three calls every day for ECMO. In two weeks, seven ECMO therapies were initiated for patients with Covid-19 related ARDS. With the help of a local private company (Come-Scape\u00ae, Amiens, France) a free-app named \"Covid-19 practical Sheets\" (Covid-19 Fiches pratiques) has been designed [5] . After creating a website on Wordpress\u00ae, an extension was added in order to build a Progressive Web App (WPA). This kind of application allows a web page to appear as a mobile application combining functionalities of a modern web browser and usefulness of mobile phones. An ICU consultant (BT) was dedicated to daily update all information given on the App. The App was initially designed for anaesthesiologists and intensivists from Picardy. However, 72 hours after its launch, more than 100 000 connections were registered, not only from France but from several French speaking countries in Europe, North Africa and North America.",
