According to a report by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD, 2007), construction waste amounted to 29,884 tonnes per day in 2006, 27% (4,125 tonnes per day) of the total construction waste were disposed of at landfill sites in Hong Kong.

Data collected from the questionnaire surveys were input in the T-model to work out the movement of cultural components. To capture the movement of the cultural component \u201cawareness\u201d within the government group, the scores obtained from questionnaire surveys related to the awareness of the government group are sorted out according to the marking scheme setup in the questionnaire. The sorted scores of awareness are then multiplied by the influential factor (ai) of the government group, the product is the cultural value of awareness of the government group. This cultural value of awareness of the government group can be added up with the cultural value of awareness of other groups being worked in the same way to form the total score of awareness of construction participants. Similar approaches are applied to other cultural components to obtain the total concern, total motivation and total implementation of construction participants. Formulae 1 and 2 of the T-model which are demonstrated below express how the data are handled.",

Comparing the area of the quadrangle bounded by cultural components in every research year plane with the area of quadrangle of the base year plane, the difference in area is the numerical value of cultural shift of the research year with respect to the base year.

These three groups are the executors of project design and construction, their non-performance in sustainability are governed by rules and regulations with penalty system.

The landfill charge policy affected all construction practitioners because it applied not only to construction operations but also influenced substantially on contractual arrangements and commercial benefits. Stakeholders tried to reduce contractual liability in the generation of C&D wastes starting from design activities to construction operations.

In this period, economic growth in Hong Kong was retarded and high unemployment rate was recorded due to an economic recession. Although there was no improvement in economic conditions, the change became significant between the years 2002 and 2004.

The spread of this fatal epidemic and the attempt to subdue and prevent have resulted in a remarkable change in the recognition of sustainability among Hong Kong citizens.
