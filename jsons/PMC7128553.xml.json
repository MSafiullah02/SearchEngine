Within a year, SARS-CoV infected more than 8,000 people across 29 countries and cost more than 900 human lives [1]. Lack of knowledge of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV and the absence of efficacious therapeutic agents were the main reasons for the failure to manage the outbreak of SARS effectively. After the causative agent of the devastating disease was identified by us and others 2, 3, 4, the genome of SARS-CoV was decoded rapidly by several groups 5, 6, 7. Subsequently, reverse genetics with SARS-CoV cDNA was accomplished [8], and ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for the virus [9], highlighting the rapid responses of the scientific community to this previously unknown global pathogen.",

We decided to dissect the pathogenic pathways of the SARS-CoV using chemical genetics. We hypothesized that by using forward chemical genetics 15, 16, in which small molecules that induce altered phenotypes in cells or organisms are identified and their cellular targets will then be determined subsequently, we will be able to isolate novel small-molecule compounds perturbing the biological pathways that are essential for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.",

After being internalized into the target cells, SARS-CoV undergoes a very rapid replication cycle through a series of concerted transcriptional, translational, posttranslational, and proteolytic processing events, leading to maturation and release of infective viral particles into the culture supernatant 17, 18, 19. We speculated that the various biological pathways involved in viral pathogenesis could be perturbed by small molecules using chemical genetic approaches. To examine the feasibility of employing chemical genetic approaches in SARS-CoV research, we acquired a chemical library (ChemBridge Corporation) of 50,240 structurally diverse small-molecule compounds that vary in functional groups and charges. As the SARS-CoV replicates effectively in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cell line) and full cytopathic effects (CPE) of the infected cells can be observed within 96 hr postinfection, Vero cell CPE was used as a phenotypic indicator of successful viral infection in a cell-based assay to screen for small-molecule compounds that perturb the infectivity of the virus. The employment of high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies to generate a collection of structurally diverse small-molecule compounds perturbing the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV will lay down the foundation to dissecting the molecular basis of viral infections using chemical genetics.",

When the hits were rearrayed and the concentration of selected compounds was lowered to 10 \u03bcg/ml for secondary screening, 104 compounds retained consistent protective effects against SARS-CoV-induced CPE in Vero cells (Figure 1)\n. Further evaluation by quantitative plaque reduction assays demonstrated that the EC50 (median effective concentration) of the selected compounds were below 10 \u03bcg/ml, with 78 compounds having an EC50 below 2 \u03bcg/ml. For subsequent studies, the concentrations of selected compounds were converted to molar units for more precise comparison of their biological activities. The TC50 (median toxic concentration) of selected compounds was determined to be >50 \u03bcM by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylth-iazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. To test our hypothesis that the 104 selected compounds represent diverse molecular blockers of various biological pathways crucial for SARS-CoV infectivity, we screened for molecules targeting viral entry, transcription, and proteolytic processing, the three major processes essential for successful viral replication in the host.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV Mpro is believed to play a major role in proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins and is regarded as a prime target for anti-SARS-CoV drug development 20, 21. The recently available crystal structure of the SARS-CoV Mpro makes it a suitable target for structure-based rational drug design [22]. We cloned the SARS-CoV Mpro in an E. coli expression system and obtained purified enzyme to examine if any of the 104 selected compounds targets this vital component of the virus. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assays were used to monitor the in vitro cleavage activity of the viral Mpro. The purified SARS-CoV Mpro cleaved efficiently and specifically a synthetic peptide with the sequence H2N-TSAVLQ\u2193SGFRKW-COOH mimicking the putative autolytic cleavage site (the cleavage site is indicated with a \u2193) of the N-terminal part of Mpro\n[22]. Screening of the 104 compounds at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml identified two candidates as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV Mpro. One of the compounds (designated MP576) displayed potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 (median inhibitory concentration) of 2.5 \u03bcM (Figure 2A)\nand an EC50 of 7 \u03bcM in the Vero cell-based SARS-CoV plaque reduction assay (Figure 2B). Furthermore, MP576 can be docked favorably into the active site of SARS-CoV Mpro\n(Figure 2C), consistent with the in vitro cleavage data indicating that MP576 is a novel nonpeptide inhibitor of SARS-CoV Mpro. Since SARS-CoV Mpro shares a similar structural fold with serine proteases 21, 23, we tested the inhibitory activity of MP576 on human neutrophil elastase (HNE). Using azocasein as the substrate, we demonstrated that 100 \u03bcM of MP576 failed to inhibit the proteolytic activity of HNE (Figure 2D), suggesting that MP576 is not a general protease inhibitor.",

It was demonstrated that the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase had an unstimulated ATPase activity that could be stimulated by the addition of polynucleotides, in particular dT24. As the functional conformation of the helicase is likely to be the nucleic acid-bound state, we initially screened the 104 active compounds against the polynucleotide-stimulated ATPase activity of SARS-CoV Hel at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml. Seven compounds exhibited inhibitory activity. One of the compounds (designated HE602) exhibited substantial inhibitory activity at 2 \u03bcg/ml. HE602 was found to strongly inhibit the polynucleotide-stimulated ATPase activity of SARS-CoV Hel with an IC50 of 6.9 \u03bcM (Figure 3A)\n, but barely inhibited the unstimulated ATPase activity even at a concentration of 200 \u03bcM (Figure 3B). In the helicase assay, a duplex DNA was prepared incorporating a 5\u2032 overhang that is required for SARS-CoV helicase activity. The shorter strand of the duplex DNA incorporated a 32P label so that differential migration of the duplex or single-stranded oligonucleotide could be easily observed following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It can be clearly seen that both 200 and 20 \u03bcM concentrations of HE602 inhibited the helicase activity of the SARS-CoV Hel, while 2 and 0.2 \u03bcM concentrations did not inhibit the helicase activity (Figure 3C). It was only possible to perform a qualitative assay with this system, but these results are fully consistent with the IC50 value that we measured using our quantitative ATPase assay. Furthermore, HE602 inhibited the viral plaque formation in Vero cell with an EC50 of 6 \u03bcM (Figure 3D). The effective inhibition of only the stimulated ATPase activity together with its ability to inhibit helicase activity indicates that HE602 has distinct parallels with the pharmacological profiles of inhibitors targeted against the herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase protein 23, 25.",

After screening 50,240 compounds, 104 fulfilled the criteria of being protective against SARS-CoV infection in cell culture without apparent cytotoxicity. The structures of the active compounds varied (unpublished data), suggesting that this collection of small molecules may modulate different biological pathways involved in viral propagation. To examine if this selected reservoir of biologically active compounds could be used to probe essential pathways involved in SARS-CoV infection, three pathways (viral entry, transcription/replication, and proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins) speculated to be crucial for SARS-CoV infection were chosen as testing candidates. By selecting without bias these important molecular targets/pathways and subsequent successful identification of their molecular blockers from the 104 compounds obtained by cell-based HTS, we can speculate that this reservoir of biologically active compounds covers most, if not all, biological pathways crucial to SARS-CoV infection. The specific inhibitory activities of MP576, HE602, and VE607 in various in vitro assays are summarized in Table 1\n. Though the inhibitory roles of MP576, HE602, VE607 and other active compounds are indisputable, the precise mode of inhibition of these novel inhibitors is currently under investigation. In addition, one has to be cautioned that the ultimate validation of their targets will be the selection of chemical-resistant viruses and subsequent identification of genetic mutations conferring the resistant phenotype.",
