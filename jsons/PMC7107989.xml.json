[12] observed 3050 patients admitted to intensive care units during a 15-month study period; 1193 patients (39%) were mechanically ventilated, and 235 met the criteria for ARDS (7.7% of the total number of patients, and 19.7% of the ventilated patients). The predominant etiology of ARDS was sepsis (44%), and pneumonia was the most frequent single entity (65 cases). The authors did not differentiate between CAP and nosocomial pneumonia, and they have not followed-up with patients with pneumonia who have not developed ARDS to identify risk factors. The figures given by this group were comparable with those of previous studies that used similar ARDS criteria [13\u201316], with pneumonia remaining the most frequent single cause of sepsis. However, to draw meaningful conclusions, we need larger, prospective cohort studies that observe patients with CAP for progression to ARDS.",

In a multivariate analysis incorporating age; sex; the presence of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, or neurologic disease; alcohol consumption; prior antibiotic exposure; delayed antibiotic therapy; and TNF-\u03b1 genotype, the only factors that remained significant predictors of septic shock were LT\u03b1+250 genotype and increasing age. The study design was repeated with a focus on the possible role of the intracellular adhesion molecule type 1 but failed to yield a significant association between CAP and sepsis [18]. Ten (4%) of the 289 patients in the cohort had ARDS, but it was not noted whether sepsis or septic shock preceded ARDS. These data, however, did not directly address the issue of whether sepsis is the required link between ARDS and pneumonia. Thus, risk factors for both development of severe sepsis and ARDS in the course of CAP remain undefined.",

The occurrence of VAP was significantly higher among patients with ARDS (55%) than among patients without ARDS (28%). These data suggest that ARDS may be a risk factor that predisposes ill persons to VAP, as suggested by other investigators [26]. However, the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS may be more important in predisposing them to VAP than ARDS itself [25, 27].",

The investigators used soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a marker of pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation [29]. In mechanically ventilated patients with VAP, the detection of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type 1 was a much more accurate diagnostic tool than any clinical finding. It was the strongest independent factor, predicting pneumonia (OR, 41.5) according to a logistic regression analysis with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 90%. The control group included a large number of patients with ARDS (31 [48%] of 64 patients), and the differential power of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells should be tested under this specific hypothesis. However, because soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells has been shown to be elevated in newly admitted, critically ill patients with suspected sepsis, this will exclude a large patient group with extrapulmonary pathogenesis of ARDS caused by sepsis [31].",

Sharma et al. [44] found a prolonged duration of illness, miliary tuberculosis, absolute lymphocytopenia, and an elevated liver enzyme level to be independent predictors for the development of ARDS. However, they reviewed a cohort of 2733 patients and reported 29 patients with ARDS (1%), confirming the low prevalence of severe lung injury in patients with tuberculosis.",

Influenza A was by far the most common viral etiology, and the annual prevalence showed a seasonal pattern. It seemed that persons with mixed infections were at increased risk to progress to sepsis or septic shock; however, data on ARDS were not provided in this study. Also, in their observational study, Rabagliati et al.

Surprisingly, no additional information from observational trials regarding the issue of Influenza A and ARDS in the immunocompetent host is available. However, it may be assumed that the progression of Influenza A infection from severe CAP to sepsis and/or septic shock to ARDS is a rare event, in contrast to the currently evaluated human cases of avian influenza virus infection.",

The pulmonary infiltration in the observed children \u201coccasionally progressed, with subsequent deterioration to a final common pattern of acute respiratory distress syndrome\u201d [48, p. 793], and almost all patients with ARDS died. Because of the paramount interest, virtually no confirmed cases remained unpublished; therefore, it must be assumed that the progression to ARDS is common among human avian influenza virus infections. The clinical picture of H5N1 infection has been recently reviewed, and it was reported that the average levels of plasma IFN-\u03b1 among patients with avian influenza A who died were \u223c3 times as high as those among healthy controls [49].

Whereas SARS is a qualitative term that does not define the severity of lung injury, ARDS is a quantitative term [50]. Hence, coronavirus infection can provoke SARS that is severe enough to be called ARDS, but SARS is not always characterized by coronavirus infection. Consequently, Chen et al. [51] identified ARDS in only 33 (49%) of 67 patients with SARS. They described age >65 years (OR, 10.6), diabetes mellitus (OR, 13.7), and lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 8.4) as being independent predictors of ARDS. The overall mortality was 31% (21 of 67 patients), and 21 (64%) of 33 patients developed ARDS. Peiris et al. [52] found lower figures; 15 (20%) of 75 patients progressed to ARDS during the 3-week follow-up period. They also identified age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamuvidine as being significant risk factors, but did not mention LDH. The mortality reported in this study was surprisingly low (5 [ 5%] of 75 patients); after subtracting the 2 patients who died from myocardial infarction, only 2 (15%) of 13 patients died from sepsis and ARDS [52]. Reports from several other series have suggested that a substantial number of patients develop respiratory failure and ARDS, with 17%\u201330% of patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit [53, 54] and a 21-day mortality of 3.6% [55].",

The case reports describe young males with bilateral infiltrates with a rapid progression to ARDS [59\u201362]. The anti-infective treatment invariably contains acyclovir, and in some cases, the treatment contains corticosteroid and/or immunoglobulins. One review found that 6 of 15 patients had life-threatening varicella pneumonia treated with corticosteroids [63]. These patients had significantly shorter hospital and intensive care unit stays (10 and 8 days, respectively), and no patient died. A newer case series of 14 patients with severe varicella pneumonia established the diagnosis of ARDS in 3 of 14 patients, and 1 patient died. All but 1 patient in this series had previous contact with a varicella-infected patient and no varicella infection during childhood [64]. Varicella infections go along with the characteristic rash; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are almost always established immediately, and bilateral infiltrates seem to be common.",

It has to be considered regularly in acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and a list of pathogens can be derived from the literature [66, 67]. Malaria due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum is, however, noted remarkably often in the literature as being associated with ARDS. Losert et al. [68] reviewed 104 patients admitted to the hospital with malaria, of whom 66% had P. falciparum infections, and 7 of these were admitted to the intensive care unit. Four patients underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation and developed ARDS, and 3 patients died. In another study [69], only intensive care unit patients were considered, and 8 (20%) of 40 developed ARDS, with a mortality of 50%. Complications of malaria, such as coma, sepsis, or shock, were more prevalent among the group of patients with acute lung injury in this study and in the retrospective report by Bruneel et al. [70]. Therefore, we would like to support the hypothesis that ARDS is associated with the multiorgan failure that complicates the course of severe infection with P. falciparum, but the mechanisms seem to be independent from the causative agent [69, 70].",

The prevalence of pneumonia during the course of ARDS seems to be particularly high, but whether patients with ARDS are more susceptible to pneumonia or simply have more risk factors remains unknown because of limitations in the methodology of the diagnosis of VAP and ARDS. Recent research suggests that host factors have a major bearing on the development of ARDS. Accordingly, the individual role of specific pathogens in the development of ARDS is difficult to assess. Most recently, new respiratory viruses have received particular attention, and this review suggests that infections with coronavirus and avian influenza virus are associated with an exceptionally high incidence of lung injury and ARDS.",
