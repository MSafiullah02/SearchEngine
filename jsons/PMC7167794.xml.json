Although viral infections are also common after MRD\u2010HSCT, the risk for severe disease is higher in MUD and haplo\u2010HSCT due to more severely depressed T cell\u2010mediated immune responses. The addition of T cell\u2010depleting agents such as ATG to conditioning regimen in MUD transplantation has been associated with a reduced incidence of GVHD but increased risk for delayed immune reconstitution.2, 3, 4 Also, TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2/CD3 depletion for the prophylaxis of GVHD achieved a significant success in haploidentical HSCT, but is associated with increased risk for viral infections.5 The aim of our study was to compare the incidence of virus infections and outcomes in children who underwent HSCT from MRD, MUD1, MUD2, and haploidentical donors.",

All of these patients received IVIG treatment. Most of them (5/12) cleared the viremia in 1 month. Two patients, who were already positive pre\u2010HSCT, are still positive for parvovirus B19 after 3 months in one patient (viral load 218455 copy/mL) and 6 months in another patient (viral load 14410 copy/mL) post\u2010HSCT, but they do not have any symptoms or anemia. The duration of cytopenias during the first 100 days post\u2010HSCT did not differ between those with or without parvovirus B19 viremia. Parvovirus B19 infections were found statistically different between MRD and haplo\u2010HSCT patients (4.2% vs 16.1%, P = .04). Parvovirus B19 infections did not differ between patients with haplo and MUD1\u2010MUD2 HSCT.",

The incidence of viral infections can be the best indicator of immune recovery. This study, with 171 pediatric patients, is the second largest study, which reports the incidence of virus infections in children following allogeneic HSCT. We found that viral infections are especially common in the first 100 days post\u2010HSCT, suggesting a non\u2010optimal immune reconstitution after allogeneic HSCT. Children with severe acute GVHD are more likely to develop multiple viral infections probably due to prolonged and intensive immunosuppressive treatment, especially the use of corticosteroids. The largest study by Hiwarkar et al8 consisted of 291 pediatric patients with 34% MRD, 31% MUD, and 35% \u22651 ag HLA\u2010mismatched donors. They reported CMV (16%), ADV (15%), and EBV (11%) frequently during period of CD4 T\u2010cell lymphopenia and found that ADV and EBV reactivations had additional associations with the use of HLA\u2010mismatched grafts. Rustia et al's9 study was the third largest study of 140 pediatric patients with 40.7% MRD and 49.3% MUD. They found similar incidence results for CMV (21.4%), ADV (11.4%), and EBV (10%) like Hiwarkar et al. In our study, we found that BK virus and CMV reactivations were significantly low in MRD transplant patients compared with MUD1/MUD2 and haplo\u2010HSCT. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the only study that compared the viral incidence between haplo\u2010HSCT and MRD/MUD HSCT. We detected the incidence of CMV reactivation in 28.2% ofMRD patients but more than 60% of haplo\u2010 and MUD1/MUD2 HSCT recipients were positive for CMV reactivation. This difference can be explained with ethnic and geographical differences in CMV seroprevalence in Turkish population.10, 11 In our country, the seroprevalence rates in the age groups of 1\u20106, 7\u201014, and 14\u201049 years were detected as 82%, 92%, and 97.8%, respectively.11\n",

In our study, overall survival was comparable among MUD1/MUD2 and haplo\u2010HSCT patients, whereas overall survival was superior for patients with MRD\u2010HSCT (P < .0001). Similar to other studies, in the presence of one or multiple viral infection, the overall survival was found significantly lower compared with those without viral infection (P = .04 and P = .0008). MUD2 HSCT led to the highest incidence of TRM at day 100 compared with MRD, haplo, and MUD1 HSCT (17.5% vs 2.8%, 9.7%, and 6.9%). This significance was statistically borderline (P = .058). Haplo\u2010HSCT was associated with superior TRM than MUD1 HSCT at the end of follow\u2010up (P = .03).

Except CMV, surveillance for viruses was performed only in clinical suspicion, so the frequency of these infections might have been underestimated. In conclusion, CMV and BK virus infections were found to be significantly low in MRD\u2010HSCT in this study. MUD and haplo\u2010HSCT are comparable with each other in the setting of all viral infections, which is not stated in previous studies. Despite antiviral prophylaxis and treatments, post\u2010transplant viral infections are associated with reduced overall survival and increased hospitalization, but these complications are significantly preventable with good follow\u2010up and preemptive treatment without any clinical disease. For this reason, especially in countries where it takes a long time to find suitable donors, viral diseases should not interfere with the decision of haplo\u2010HSCT considering the time spent on the patient. A larger study group and prospective studies are needed to confirm this observation. In these patients with post\u2010transplant viral disease, the potential widespread application of virus\u2010specific T lymphocyte therapy may likely reduce long\u2010term morbidity and mortality.",
