It is a system of tubes that allows for gas exchange between the body and the external environment. The mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract translate to a very large surface area with which viruses can interact. A resting human inhales around 2 gallons of air every minute, and within each breath are aerosolized droplets and particles that could contain viruses, such as from a cough or sneeze of an infected individual.",

Within the lungs, the two bronchi branch into smaller-diameter bronchioles that lead to an estimated 300 million alveoli (singular: alveolus), where gas exchange occurs (Fig. 5.2B). Viruses contained in larger droplets are deposited in the upper respiratory tract, while smaller aerosolized particles or liquids are able to travel into the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract epithelium contains abundant goblet cells that produce mucus, a thick fluid that traps inhaled particulate matter. The majority of the upper respiratory epithelium is lined with cilia, small hairlike structures that move together like oars to push the mucus and its trapped contents to the throat, where it is swallowed (Fig. 5.2C). Each cell has about 300 cilia. In the lower respiratory tract, mucus-secreting goblet cells become less abundant, and ciliated cells are present at the beginning of the lower respiratory tract but are absent in the alveoli of the lungs. The flow of mucus in the upper and lower respiratory tract traps many viral particles, and antibodies (particularly of the IgA isotype) produced by immune system cells bind to virus particles, preventing them from interacting with the cells of the respiratory epithelium. Within the alveoli of the lung are found many alveolar macrophages, another kind of immune system cell that is specialized in phagocytosis, a type of receptor-mediated endocytosis that is used by macrophages to endocytose whole cells or pathogens that are then digested by lysosomes within the macrophage.\n",

Food enters the mouth, where it is chewed and begins being digested by the enzymes found in saliva, provided by the salivary glands. The pharynx moves food via the swallowing reflex into the esophagus, which has several mucus-secreting glands. Muscle contractions by the esophagus move the food into the stomach, which contains numerous pits of cells, all of which produce mucus to protect the cells from the acidic gastric juices secreted by the stomach. From there, food moves to the small intestine, where the food finishes being digested and is absorbed. The small intestine is roughly 6 ft long and is composed of fingerlike projections called villi (singular: villus) that increase the surface area of the epithelium (Fig. 5.3B and C). Moreover, the epithelial cells that form the villi have multiple hairlike microvilli at their apical (outermost) end, forming what looks like the teeth of a comb. Each cell of a villus has an estimated 3000 microvilli. Together, the total surface area of the small intestine is similar to that of a tennis court. This increases the area of contact for absorption of food, but some viruses also take advantage of this area of exposure for infection (Table 5.1).",

The membrane envelopes of most enveloped viruses are disintegrated by bile. Acid-labile viruses are unable to withstand the low pH of the stomach, while acid-resistant viruses contain capsid proteins that are not denatured by low pH (or their protein denaturation is reversible).

Viruses can be transmitted from mother to child in breast milk, either as free virions or within infected cells; HIV, cytomegalovirus, and West Nile virus are three such viruses. Other viruses enter via the fecal\u2013oral route, meaning that virions present in the feces of an infected individual gain entry into the oral cavity of another individual and are ingested. This is a common occurrence in nations without water treatment plants and has been one of the major roadblocks in eradicating polio from undeveloped nations. In developed countries, touching contaminated surfaces or ingesting food or water that has been contaminated can lead to infection. Norwalk virus, described in Chapter 1, \u201cThe World of Viruses,\u201d is another virus that is transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route. It is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, causing roughly 20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis (a sudden stomach illness with vomiting and diarrhea) each year, according to the CDC.

Blood is the most commonly transplanted tissue, and before the advent of sensitive screening tests, transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) were a low probability but possible result of receiving blood and blood products. Several viruses can be transmitted through blood, including hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, West Nile virus, and dengue virus. The blood supply is currently screened for many of these, and the current risk of receiving contaminated blood is very low (Table 5.2\n). However, before tests were developed and screening was instituted, hepatitis B and C viruses contaminated the blood supply. In the early 1980s, when AIDS was reported, blood industry supporters underestimated the risk of HIV having entered the blood supply and were slow to take action. At the time, more than half of the 16,000 people in the United States with hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disease that requires blood plasma transfusions to transfer clotting factors, contracted HIV from contaminated plasma products. Similarly, it is estimated that over 20,000 people contracted HIV from contaminated blood before March 1985, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test to detect HIV. Incidents like this one have proven valuable in emphasizing the importance of detecting new viruses in the blood supply. When transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus infections were reported in 2002, a test was rapidly developed and the blood industry began regular testing of donated blood for the virus.",

To prevent the rejection of the transplant, organ recipients are given potent\nCase Study: Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection in Organ Transplant Recipients\u2014Massachusetts and Rhode Island, 2005\nExcerpted from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, May 26, 2005 54 (Dispatch):1\u20132.\nOn May 3, 2005, CDC received a report of severe illness in four patients who had received solid organ transplants from a common donor. All four organ recipients subsequently were found to have evidence of infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a rodent-borne Old World arenavirus. Preliminary findings from the ensuing investigation indicate the source of infection likely was an infected hamster in the donor\u2019s home.In early April, in Rhode Island, a woman with a medical history remarkable only for hypertension (high blood pressure) and 1 week of headache had sudden onset of hemiplegia (paralysis of one half of the body) caused by a stroke, followed by brain death within 3 days. A thorough evaluation was not suggestive of infection.Family members of the woman consented to donation; organs and tissues were recovered, including the liver, the lungs, both the kidneys, both the corneas, and the skin. Within 3 weeks after transplantation, the four persons who received the liver, lungs, and two kidneys had abnormalities of liver function and blood coagulation and dysfunction of the transplanted organ. Signs, symptoms, and clinical laboratory test results varied in these patients and included fever, localized rash, diarrhea, hyponatremia (low blood sodium), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets), hypoxia (low oxygen levels), and kidney failure. Three of the four organ recipients died, 23\u201327 days after transplantation. The fourth patient, a kidney recipient, survived.When the cause of illness among the recipients was not identified through extensive diagnostic testing and suspicion of transplant-transmitted infection arose, tissue and blood samples from the donor and recipients were sent from the Rhode Island Department of Health and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to CDC. LCMV was identified as the cause of illness in all four organ recipients. Sequencing of the virus genome confirmed its identity as LCMV.Epidemiologic InvestigationTo determine the source of LCMV infection, investigations were conducted at the hospitals involved in organ recovery and transplantation and at the coordinating organ procurement organization. Interviews also were conducted at locations where the donor had spent substantial time in the month preceding her death.Interviews with hospital and organ bank staff members revealed no likely sources of LCMV infection in the hospital or organ-recovery settings. Environmental assessment at locations the donor frequented (eg, home and work) revealed limited opportunities for exposure to wild rodents; the sole location noted with rodent infestation was a garden shed at her home. Interviews with family members of the donor determined that a pet hamster had been acquired recently. The hamster was cared for primarily by another family member. No illnesses compatible with LCMV had been reported in the donor or family members during the month preceding the donor\u2019s death.Laboratory InvestigationFamily members of the donor were tested for LCMV antibodies. The family member who cared for the hamster had specific IgM and IgG antibodies to LCMV. No other family member had detectable IgG or IgM antibodies to LCMV. All available donor tissues were tested, and no evidence of LCMV was determined. However, the pet hamster was determined positive for LCMV.\nReported by Rhode Island Hospital, Providence; Rhode Island Dept of Health.

Similarly, papillomavirus strains that infect the skin replicate locally in the epidermis. On the other hand, viruses that initiate infection through one organ but then spread to other sites within the body cause systemic infections. These viruses infect cells within the initial organ, where they either replicate locally before spread or use infected local cells to travel to other locations within the body.",

This interstitial fluid, or lymph, is collected in lymphatic vessels that lead back to lymph nodes (Fig. 5.8\n). Immune system cells filter the lymph within the lymph nodes, but high virion concentrations can mean that some escape these cells and continue within the lymph, which is eventually returned to the bloodstream. Viremia is the term used to describe the presence of virus within the bloodstream. Since blood circulates throughout the entire body, viruses can use the bloodstream to gain access to their cellular targets in organs other than the ones through which they entered the body.

How can these affect the dissemination of virions in the environment?\nIn-Depth Look: Transmission of Serious Diseases Through Rodent Urine and DroppingsSeveral potentially dangerous viruses replicate primarily in rodent populations and only become problematic when the virus is inadvertently transmitted to humans. One such illness is hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), caused by a hantavirus known as Sin Nombre virus. This virus causes a fever \u2265101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), chills, muscle aches, headache, and severe respiratory problems. In the United States, an average of 29 people have been infected each year since recording began in 1993. Of these infections, 36% have been fatal.Hantaviruses are transmitted by infected deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) present throughout the western and central United States, cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) in the southeastern states, and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in the northeast. The rodents shed the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva. When fresh rodent urine and droppings are disturbed, particles containing the virus get into the air, and the virus is transmitted to people when they breathe in the virus-containing particles. The virus can also be transmitted when the person inadvertently touches rodent urine or droppings and then touches the mucous membranes of their nose or mouth. Cases of HPS most often occur in rural areas where forests, fields, and farms offer a suitable habitat for these rodents. No human-to-human transmission of hantaviruses has yet occurred.The Arenaviridae family of viruses is also associated with rodent-transmitted diseases of humans (see case study). The first arenavirus discovered was lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, in 1933. Since that time, seven other arenaviruses have been isolated. As with hantaviruses, rodents are the natural reservoirs of the arenaviruses. The viruses do not cause disease in the rodents but can be transmitted to humans by contact with infected rodent urine or droppings, either by inhaling infected particles or ingesting contaminated food. Lassa virus, Machupo virus, and Lujo viruses have been associated with person-to-person spread.\nare larger in size, about 20 \u03bcm, and therefore tend to only be spread short distances before they succumb to gravity and fall out of the air (Fig. 5.9\n). At 5 \u03bcm or less, aerosolized particles remain airborne for much longer periods of time, and the evaporation of liquid from aerosols creates smaller particles that can persist in the air for an extended period of time. Some viruses are better protected from inactivation within droplets. Aerosols, being smaller, generally have greater success in reaching the lower respiratory tract.",

Although these are defective, they are still released from the cell and act as a sponge to sequester antibodies. Although the mechanism is unknown, they also interfere with the apoptosis of infected cells, which can lead to a persistent state. The production of DI particles is more common in RNA viruses.

In comparison to droplet spread, which passes directly from one person to another, airborne transmission of viruses carried by dust or aerosolized particles that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time are considered indirect modes of transmission (see Section 5.3 for a review of droplets vs aerosolized particles).

A susceptible host is required, and control measures to increase host immune defenses can interrupt the chain of infection. Decreasing malnutrition can positively affect the immune system, but the majority of viruses that cause disease have evolved mechanisms to infect individuals with perfectly functional immune systems. Vaccination is by far the most effective means of preventing susceptibility to these pathogens. As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6, \u201cThe Immune Response to Viruses,\u201d vaccination works by exposing an individual to noninfectious parts of a pathogen to prepare the immune system for infection with the actual pathogen. Vaccination can protect the individual, but it can also protect a population through herd immunity (Fig. 5.13\n). If a large enough proportion of the population is vaccinated, then an infected individual may not come into contact with any susceptible hosts and the chain of infection will be terminated. Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, was eradicated from the human population by vaccinating any individuals that came into contact with an infected person. Eventually there were no new susceptible hosts for the virus, and it died out. Herd immunity is effective in preventing epidemics, but a virus is still able to cause an outbreak if a specific population within the herd chooses to not vaccinate its individuals. This also compromises the individuals within the herd that were unable to receive the vaccine due to medical reasons, such as allergy or immunosuppression.",

Unless delivered directly into the tissues through a mosquito bite or needle, most viruses first interact with the epithelium at the site of entry.\u2022The majority of viruses enter humans through inhalation into the respiratory tract. The gastrointestinal tract, genital tract, skin, blood, and eyes are also points of entry.\u2022Acid-labile viruses break down within the low pH of the stomach, while acid-resistant viruses are resistant.\u2022Some viruses are able to be transmitted through organ transplants or through the placenta to a developing fetus.\n",
