Among these cell types, CMs took up only around 30% of the total nuclei, and fibroblast was the largest population (26.8%) among non-myocytes, followed by the EC.

In addition, the expression of ABCC9 and PDGFRB and the absence of MYH11 help us to reaffirm the identity of the cells as pericytes instead of SMCs (Figure 1F). Different from SMCs that are located in the coronary arteries or arterioles, pericytes spread outside the endothelial cell of capillary and part of venules, which may play an essential role in myocardial micro-circulation. This result suggested that pericyte was a potential SARS-CoV-2 virus targeted host cell type in the human heart. We further screened another two related receptors of SARS-CoV, CD209, and CLEC4M. CD209 was specifically expressed in macrophage, and co-expressed with macrophage marker gene CD163, which may enhance the virus entry in the human heart (Figure 1G).

            "text": "Virus-infected cells can be damaged, subsequently disturbing the micro-environment of the myocardium. To elucidate the potential mechanism of myocardial injury when the host cells are attacked by SARS-CoV-2, we conducted cell\u2013cell interaction analysis centred on pericyte. Using the pericytes as ligand-secreting cells, we calculated the total number of interactions with each receptor-secreting cell type (Figure 1H). Two closest cell type crosstalking with pericytes were Neu and ECs. The former cell type was not identified and studied in the heart before. ECs showed extensive linkages with pericytes, with dominant role of angiopoietin ligands (ANGPT1/2)\u2013Tie receptor (TIE2) interaction in normal heart, which could promote vascular EC survival and reduced vascular leakage. The ANGPT1/2-TIE1 crosstalk also exists but is weak between pericytes and ECs in the normal hearts. As the molecular balance between ANGPT1:ANGPT2 and TIE2:TIE1 is important in determining endothelial stability,7 it is suggested that pericytes play an important role in maintaining EC function in capillary vessels. The CD209 expressing cell macrophage also showed close interaction with ECs following T cells, mainly through ITGA9 and FLT1 (VEGFRA) receptor-mediated pathways (Figure 1I). Taken together, these results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human heart might attack pericytes, and cause capillary ECs dysfunction, thus inducing micro-circulation disorder. This may explain the clinical manifestation of CK elevation among 13% of COVID-19 patients.2 And thus, medications to improve micro-circulation may alleviate heart injury in these patients.",
