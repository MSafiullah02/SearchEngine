            "text": "Although recognition of carbohydrate antigens began in the early twentieth century with the study of microbial polysaccharides (1), the scope of investigation into these antigens has since been substantially extended (2). Conceptually, carbohydrate antigens are carbohydrate-containing macromolecules that can evoke and react with carbohydrate-specific antibodies. In terms of their structural characteristics, carbohydrate antigens are polysaccharides with solely carbohydrate moieties and various forms of glycoconjugates. The latter include natural glycoproteins and glycolipids of living cells, as well as synthetic antigens produced by coupling mono- and oligosaccharides to a larger carrier molecule.",

They may be specifically or selectively recognizable by either soluble or membrane-bound cellular proteins. In the higher eukaryotic species, the expression of cellular glycoconjugates, and especially their complex carbohydrate structures, is frequently cell type or tissue specific. In microbes, many sugar chains, including those displayed on the surface of a microbial cell and those secreted outside it, have been recognized as \u201csignatures\u201d of specific pathogens. Exploring the biological information content of sugar chains is a current focus of glycomics research.",

These carbohydrate microarrays are all solid-phase binding assays for carbohydrates and their interaction with other biological molecules. In spite of their technological differences, they share a number of common characteristics and technical advantages. First, they have the capacity to display a large panel of carbohydrates in a limited chip space. Second, the amount needed to spot each carbohydrate is drastically smaller than that required for a conventional molecular or immunological assay. Third, the microarray-based assays have higher detection sensitivity than most conventional molecular and immunological assays; this increased sensitivity is due to the fact that the binding of a molecule in solution phase to an immobilized microspot of ligand in the solid phase minimally reduces the molar concentration of the molecule in solution (14). Therefore, it is much easier to have a binding equilibrium take place in a microarray assay and result in a high sensitivity.",

Technically, we make the use of complementary methods to diversify and extend the repertoires of glycoepitopes in bioarray substrates. It is important to note that carbohydrate microarrays constructed by various methods may differ in their technical features and suitability for a given practical application. For example, they may differ in the detection specificity. The carbohydrate antigen microarray discussed here would be antigen specific but not epitope specific, if the native carbohydrate antigens were spotted. This is owing to the fact that many carbohydrate antigens, such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, display more than one antigenic determinant, including glyco- and nonglycoepitopes. Examining the finer details of the binding properties would require the use of microarrays of pure saccharide sequences. The mono- and oligosaccharide array-based binding assays, such as sister chapters in this book, may be employed, in combination with saccharide competition assays, to decipher precise saccharide components of a specific antigenic determinant or glycoepitope (6, 11, 13).",

            "text": "\nAntigen preparations suitable for this high-throughput biochip platform: Carbohydrate antigens of multiple structural configurations, including polysaccharides, natural glycoconjugates, oligosaccharide\u2013protein, and oligosaccharide\u2013lipid conjugates, are applicable for platform of carbohydrate antigen microarrays (3, 6, 10). In addition to printing carbohydrate microarrays, this platform is also applicable for producing protein microarrays (15). As with carbohydrate microarrays, there is no need to chemically conjugate a protein for its surface immobilization. However, it is recommended that each antigen preparation be tested on chip substrate for the efficacy of immobilization and expression of antigenic determinants.Preservation of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates: Purified polysaccharides are generally stored as dried powder at room temperature. They can also be preserved in saline solutions (0.9% NaCl) containing a droplet of chloroform and stored at 4\u00b0C for a long period of time. Glycoconjugates are structurally diverse. Conditions for their storage are likely variable although it is practical to store them as smaller aliquots in Revco freezers (\u221280\u00b0C) to avoid multiple freezing and thawing of given preparation.Printing of samples: Before loading sample solutions onto the arrayer, it is important to spin the solution in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed (at least 15,000  \u00d7  g) for at least 15 min. Before and after each arraying experiment, it is recommended to examine and clean the printing pins following a routine pin cleaning protocol recommended by the corresponding printing pin manufacturers. A test slide is usually implemented to optimize quality of printing. The water supply of the Cartesian arrayer should constantly be checked during the arraying experiment to ensure adequate flow to the wash chamber.Examination of the presence of samples on array and their antigenic structures: It is essential to examine whether proteins, synthetic peptides, and carbohydrates are successfully \u201cprinted\u201d and whether desired epitopes or antigenic determinants are preserved on the chips. The printed microarrays can be incubated with antibodies, receptors, or lectins known to react with the printed substance. The reaction is detected either by conjugating directly a fluorochrome to the \u201cdetector\u201d or by a second-step staining procedure.Storage of printed carbohydrate and protein microarrays: The arrays are usually air dried and stored at room temperature. For long-term preservation, the chips can be sealed in a vacuum-dried plastic bag with desiccant and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.Staining considerations: After the last wash between each staining step, it is important to completely withdraw the wash buffer from inside reaction chambers. Otherwise, the remaining buffer may lower antibodies\u2019 concentration to be analyzed.Biosafety procedures: When working with chemicals, suitable protective wear, such as lab coat and disposable gloves, are advised. When human serum specimens are involved, experiments must be conducted in accordance to the standard biosafety procedures instituted by CDC and WHO.Scanning and data collection: Training with the technical experts of PerkinElmer is necessary before performing microarray scanning and data collection using the ScanArray Express software package.\n",
