Exclusion criteria: Patients with incomplete data. Primary outcome: 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: 14-day mortality, hospital length of stay, length of stay in the ICU, and use of mechanical ventilation. Grouping: > 48 h group and \u226448 h group were divided according to the use of intravenous immunoglobulin within 48 h after admission. Our treatment plan was as follows: all patients received oxygen therapy and Abidor antiviral treatment and were initially administered the antibiotic moxifloxacin, according to the patient's clinical symptoms and signs and laboratory results, which were used to determine whether to adjust the antibiotics. In addition, according to the patient's condition, they were subjected to low molecular heparin anticoagulation, and when the absolute lymphocyte count fell to < 0.5\u00d7 10 9 /L at 20 g/day, they received intravenous immunoglobulin and correction for hypoalbuminemia. If the absolute number of lymphocytes was still low five days later, we used Thymosin to boost immune function. Patients in critical condition received intravenous administration of small doses of glucocorticoids (1-2 mg/kg) for 5-7 days depending on their condition. All other treatments were administered according to the WHO guidelines. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcomes data from patient records. Final clinical results were followed up through February 29, 2020.",

This is the first clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients. IVIG is applied in the adjuvant treatment of critical patients. As a blood product purified from the mixed plasma of healthy people, protein is the main component, and it is rich in bacterial antibodies and viral IgG, etc. Continuous infusion can improve the IgG level in the serum, effectively neutralizing the pathogens in the respiratory tract of patients, and thereby promoting the recovery from diseases and shortening the course of disease [4] . IVIG can improve the body's defense, block the receptors associated with the target cell, and prevent the pathogen from further damaging the target cell [4] . In addition, the use of IVIG can also influence the process of lymphocyte differentiation and maturation, hinder the normal immune response of white blood cells, inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, and thus decrease the inflammatory injury experienced by patients [3, 5, 6] . A previous meta-analysis using IVIG in SARS infection concluded that whether intravenous infusion of IVIG could improve the prognosis is still unclear [7] . There are also literature reports on the use of IVIG in MERS infection [8] , but there is no evidence that IVIG has anti-MERS activity, as specific efficacy has not been reported. Studies on influenza virus infection, such as H1N1, have shown that IVIG can prevent severe pandemic influenza infection [9] . A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial using hyperimmune globulin in the treatment of patients with severe 2009 H1N1 infection found that the use of h-IVIG in the treatment of severe H1N1 infection within 5 days of symptom onset was associated with reduced viral load and reduced mortality [3] . It is therefore worth examining when to use IVIG to assist the treatment of COVID-19. In our first analysis, we found that the use of IVIG within 24 hours after admission had no significant statistical difference in either the 28-day mortality or the 14-day mortality rates, but the use of IVIG within 48 hours could significantly reduce the 28-day mortality rate, indicating that the initiation time of IVIG was related to the reduction of the COVID-19 mortality rate.",

In four previously published studies of critically ill patients, the use of IVIG was not mentioned in detail, and it was impossible to summarize the effect of IVIG use on prognosis of these patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [2, 10] . Our research also has several limitations. Our study only included 58 patients with severe illness. The 28-day mortality rate of this population cannot represent all patients with severe COVID-19, and the mortality rate is also different at based on different times of illness onset within the same center. We included all critical patients in the intensive care unit of Wuhan Third hospital who met the inclusion criteria. Because of the exploratory nature of the study, the calculation of sample size is exempted. Meanwhile, the next step is to confirm this conclusion with a larger sample size. This is a retrospective study. The data in this study allowed for a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of IVIG therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, additional prospective randomized controlled studies are needed for further verification.",
