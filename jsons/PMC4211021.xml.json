Unlike traditional media, it provides an open platform that allows various people to report, confirm, and correct details regarding issues of public concern. For example, \u201cInternet mass hunting,\u201d which literally means to uncover the true identity of a particular person or matter through the coordinated efforts of all \u201cnetizens,\u201d is an approach to using the Internet for conducting investigations [2]. In China, this approach has been increasingly employed by the public to elucidate issues of public concern, such as cases of corruption [3].",

Eysenbach developed a method for analyzing Google queries to track cases of influenza-type illnesses in a given population [4,5]. That method was employed to accurately predict weekly influenza activity in each region in the United States with a reporting lag of approximately 1 day [6]. Health surveys and clinical trials have also been conducted through the Internet [7-10]. Other examples of Internet-based research in the health sciences include Infovigil, HealthMap, MedISys, BioCaster, and EpiSPIDER [11-15]. Compared with traditional field research methods, such as face-to-face interviews and paper-based questionnaires, Internet-based methods involve considerably fewer resources, including money, time, and human resources. The Internet is particularly useful for obtaining information and influencing behavioral responses during public crises [16], such as during outbreaks of new infectious diseases.",

After the first case was reported, H7N9 rapidly became a widely discussed topic on the Internet. A considerable volume of relevant information was made publicly available on the Internet through various channels, including news reports, discussion forums, personal blogs, and reports from hospitals and government authorities. In this study, we aimed to describe the outbreak of H7N9 in China based on data available on the Internet by February 10, 2014, and to explore the methods, feasibility, validity, advantages, and limitations of employing the Internet-based approach to investigating public health issues by comparing our findings with those presented in a well-conducted conventional field epidemiologic study on the H7N9 outbreak [17].",

Third, as publically available Internet data are open to any potentially interested people worldwide with the skills to do the analyses. This can greatly facilitate the timely analysis and update of an outbreak so that rapid and appropriate action can be taken for its control. Fourth, early initial Internet data and their analyses may greatly help alert and pressure governments and authorities to facilitate timely publication of all the data to the general public, ideally through the Internet, which can facilitate timely action against the outbreak by preventing intents of withholding data for other reasons, such as motivations resulting from political parallelism or the benefits from publishing a high impact factor journal paper. Fifth, Internet data can be easily complemented, counterchecked, and corrected by others who have access to all or some of the original data from different sources.

We estimated the case fatality only based on limited data on individual cases identified. The estimate was lower than that reported in Li\u2019s study [17] for the outbreak period before December 1, 2014, but similar to that reported in Wikipedia [23], which showed that as of March 1, 2014, there were 375 confirmed cases of H7N9 and 80 people had died resulting in a case fatality rate of 21.3%. Maybe the case fatality rate for H7N9 was indeed lower in the second outbreak between the late 2013 and the early 2014 than that in the early 2013. Official aggregate data are yet needed to confirm this result.",

Furthermore, our epidemic curve was similar in the shape, time period, peak date, and total number of cases to those reported in Li\u2019s study before December 1, 2013. However, between December 1, 2013 and February 10, 2014, 196 cases were identified for the second outbreak but the date of illness onset was available only for 30 patients, which prevented us from describing reliably the epidemic curve for the second outbreak. This indicates that Internet-based methods may be, for the time being, more suitable for investigating the early stage of sudden and short-lasting events of public concern.",

The results of the study agreed in most epidemiological and clinical characteristics with those from an authoritative conventional epidemiologic study [17]. Internet-based investigations appear particularly useful for sudden, emergent, relatively short-lasting issues or events of great public concern that involve a relatively small number of cases and for which relevant data can be conveniently uploaded and updated on the Internet. Such investigations can be conducted by any interested people who have the skills to do the analyses so that the issue can be publicized more quickly and updated for quicker and better understanding and controlling of the problem. It will greatly facilitate such investigations if governments, authorities, organizations, or individuals can consciously and systematically put relevant data on the Internet and make them publicly accessible for the greater good of the public.",
