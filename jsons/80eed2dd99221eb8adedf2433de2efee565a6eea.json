Among six distinct PAKs in mammals, PAK1 is the major 'pathogenic kinase', the abnormal activation of which is responsible for a wide variety of diseases and disorders including cancers, ageing processes and infectious and inflammatory diseases such as pandemic coronaviral infection. Recently, for a clinical application, a few potent (highly cell-permeable and water-soluble) PAK1 blockers have been developed from natural or synthetic PAK1 blockers (triptolide, vitamin D3 and ketorolac) via a series of 'chemical evolutions' that boost pharmacological activities >500 times.",

            "text": "More than four decades ago, an NIH team discovered a peculiar kinase in a soil amoeba that phosphorylated the heavy chain of an unusual myosin: a single-headed myosin (myosin I), and this phosphorylation led to a robust activation of myosin I ATPase by actin fiber (F-actin) [1] . Interestingly, myosin I is essential for amoeboid movement including phagocytosis and cell migration but not for cell division (cytokinesis), which depends on another myosin: doubleheaded myosin (myosin II). Curiously, the amoeba myosin I heavy-chain kinase phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of smooth muscle myosin II from mammals, leading to a robust activation of this muscle myosin II ATPase by F-actin. Therefore, if such a kinase should exist in mammals as well, the mammalian counterpart was anticipated to raise the blood pressure by triggering smooth muscle contraction along blood vessel walls.",

            "text": "Eventually, 17 years later, according to an early 1994 issue of Nature [2] , a similar kinase was discovered in the mammalian brain by a British scientist (Dr Ed Manser) in Singaporeand named p21-activated kinase (PAK)1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1). Because the G proteins called RAC and CDC42 were known to be activated by the oncogenic G protein RAS, which is responsible for >30% of malignant transformation of human cells (such as pancreatic, colon and lung cancers), we wondered whether PAK1 might be responsible for RAS-induced malignant transformation. Soon, Ed Manser's team discovered another protein called PIX, which is essential for the activation of PAK1, and found that the PIX-PAK1 interaction is essential for a phenomenon called 'membrane ruffling' of cancer cells [3, 4] . The SH3 domain of PIX binds to the Pro-rich domain of PAK1 called PAK18, consisting of 18 amino acids [4] . Because the actomyosin-based membrane ruffling is closely linked to RAS-induced malignant transformation, a team at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Melbourne Branch) synthesized a highly cell-permeable peptide called WR-PAK18, in which the cell-permeable (Trp-and Arg-rich) peptide vector WR is linked to PAK18, and they confirmed that WR-PAK18 inhibits the RAS-induced malignant transformation with an IC 50 below 5 mM by blocking the PIX-PAK1 interaction in cells [5] . This peptide was the very first PAK1 blocker that suppressed the growth of cancer cells selectively, without affecting normal cell growth.",

Furthermore, it was found that a PAK1-deficient mutant of Caenorhabditis elegans lives 60% longer than the wild-type [6] , proving that even a normal level of PAK1 is sufficient to shorten the healthy lifespan. Thus, in theory, PAK1 blockers could promote longevity as well. In fact, several natural PAK1 blockers such as propolis and melatonin significantly extend the healthy lifespan of small animals such as C. elegans and mice [6, 7] . Undoubtedly, therefore, the potential market value of PAK1 blockers could be huge in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Thus, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the mammalian pathogenic kinase (PAK1) cloning, the first international PAK symposium (12 October 2019) entitled 'Pathogenic Roles of PAK1: Anti-PAK1 Therapy Promoting the Longevity' was held in New York City (https://www. somatopublications.com/pathogenic-roles-of-pak1-including-oncogenesis-and-ageing.pdf).",

One of the natural PAK1 blockers available on the market turned out to be a bee product (alcohol-extract of beehives) called propolis. Around 1988, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE)-based propolis was found, by a team at Columbia University, to kill cancer cells selectively without any effect on normal cell growth [8] . However, the molecular mechanism underlying propolis therapy of cancers remained unknown until 2005 when CAPE or caffeic acid (CA) in propolis was revealed to downregulate RAC, just upstream of PAK1 [9] . Interestingly, although the major anticancer ingredients in propolis vastly differ from one product to another, depending on the major plant sources from which bees prepare hives, all propolis products contain PAK1 blockers such as CAPE, artepillin C (ARC) and nymphaeols, so far without any exception [10] . Moreover, unlike conventional anticancer drugs (chemotherapeutics), which cause several serious side effects such as immune suppression and hair loss, propolis caused no side effects and even promotes the immune system, hair growth and longevity [11, 12] .",

Mainly owing to a robust increase in their cell permeability, 1,2,3-triazolyl ester of ARC (15A) and of CA (15C) are 100-and 400-times more potent in anticancer and anti-PAK1 activities than ARC and CA, respectively, with IC 50 s 200 nM [14] .

Interestingly, a few years ago its R-form was found by a team at University of New Mexico to downregulate RAC, thereby blocking PAK1 with an IC 50 13 mM [16] . However, ketorolac bears a COOH moiety that hampers its free penetration through the negatively charged plasma membranes of target cells; and tends to cause an ulcer as well if used regularly. Thus, we decided to boost its cell permeability by esterization with 1,2,3-triazolyl alcohol via CC as well [15] . This esterization led to a great leap (>500 times) in the anti-PAK1 and anticancer properties of ketorolac [15] . The IC 50 of 15 K is in the range 5-24 nM against different cancer cell lines, and it increases the heat resistance of C. elegans by nine times even at 10 nM 35 C (nonpermissive temperature), inducing a heat shock gene called HSP16.2 via the longevity transcription factor FOXO, and concomitantly extends the healthy lifespan of this worm by 15-30% 20 C (permissive temperature) [17] . Facing the current climate crisis namely 'global warming or extreme heat' (e.g., frequent summer bushfires in California and the southern half of Australia), 15 K and other PAK1 blockers could provide us with a practical alternative (chemical evolution) of the genetic evolution (knockout of PAK1 gene) for our survival of the extreme heat, which might eventually lead to extinction of the whole animal kingdom from the surface of this planet (none of the plant kingdom carries the pathogenic PAK1 gene).

            "text": "Two decades later, a team at Teikyo University in Tokyo developed a series of vitamin D3 derivatives. Among them is MART-10 ( Fig. 1b) which is 100-times more-resistant to CYP24 [21] . To their great surprise, the anticancer activity of MART-10 (IC 50 100 pM) was found to be 1000times more potent than D3 (IC 50 100 nM), although it is poorly calcemic [21] . Excitingly, D3 was recently found by a German team to downregulate RAC, thereby blocking the PAK1/ LIM kinase/cofilin pathway and depolymerizing actin filaments [22] . In other words, there are at least two distinct D3-induced anticancer signaling pathways: one activating VDR and the other inactivating RAC/PAK1, both eventually downregulating an oncogenic transcription factor called b-catenin (Fig. 2a) . Furthermore, it was revealed that MART-10 also depolymerizes actin filaments in cancer cells, strongly suggesting that MART-10 is also a potent PAK1 blocker [23] . D3 was known to extend the healthy lifespan of C. elegans [24] , and MART-10 suppresses growth and metastasis of GEM-resistant human pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice with an IC 50 below 0.1 mg/kg/day [25] . Thus, 15 K and MART-10 (made in Japan) are among the most potent synthetic PAK1 blockers, and both of us are very keen to initiate their clinical trials for GEM-resistant pancreatic cancers as soon as possible with a generous financial support and/or backup from one of the keen pharmaceutical giants.",

            "text": "Pathogenic roles of PAK1 in immune system and hair growth Back in 1962, upon a spontaneous genetic mutation, a hair-less and thymus-deficient mouse strain: the nude (nu/nu) mouse, was isolated by Norman Grist in Scotland [28] . The lifespan of nu/nu mice is only 6 months, onefifth compared with the wild-type, mainly because of no immunological defense against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. However, under sterile conditions and controlled temperatures, they could live as long as the wild type. Because nu/nu mice do not reject either allografts or xenografts, they have often been used to test the anticancer effects of new drugs against human cancer xenografts, before their clinical trials. Around 2000, deficiency of a gene called FOXN1 was found to be solely responsible for their phenotypes (i.e., hair-less with thymic deficiency) [28, 29] . However, the signaling pathway(s) underlying FOXN1-dependent hair-growth and thymus development remained unknown until recently. Finally in 2018, a Chinese group solved this mystery. Downregulation of FOXN1 in human lung cancer cells (A549) activates the b-catenin gene, just downstream of PAK1, promoting the growth of cancer cells [30] , clearly indicating that FOXN1 is a tumor suppressor gene that blocks the oncogenic PAK1/b-catenin pathway. This finding is not entirely a surprise, because in 2002 a few potent D3 analogs developed by Milan Uskokovic's team at Roche promoted hairgrowth in the nu/nu mice even with the daily dose below 50 ng/kg [31] ; and a few other natural PAK1 blockers such propolis, melatonin and cucurbitacins also promoted hair growth in cell culture or in vivo [7, 32, 33] . It is also worth noting that VDR-null mice are also hair-less, and D3 could restore hair-growth in VDR-null nice [34] , probably by inactivating RAC/PAK1/ b-catenin signaling [35] (Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, downregulation of PAK1/b-catenin signaling in mice also boosts their immune system [36] .",

Nevertheless, it is expected that PAK1-deficient mice live significantly longer than the wild-type, mainly because mice treated with either melatonin or rapamycin, in which PAK1 or TOR (an oncogenic kinase downstream of PAK1) is suppressed, are far more resistant to pathogens and stresses such as coldness and UV light in the wildness, unlike the 'nude' (FOXN1-deficient) mice, and indeed live significantly longer than the control wild mice [6, 7] .

            "text": "More than two decades ago, Pfizer marketed a new antihypertension drug called sildenafil mainly for the therapy of erectile disfunction (ED) under the brand name Viagra1. It is a cyclic GMP analog that inhibits selectively the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDase 5) with an IC 50 below 5 nM [37] . It is well known that 1 in 6 males suffer from ED worldwide. However, it was recently revealed that Viagra1 suppresses the PAK1-dependent expression of PD-L1 in human lung cancer cell lines such as A549 by downregulating histone deacetylases (HDACs) with the IC 50 100 nM [38] , which eventually blocks PAK1 [6] (Fig. 3) . Thus, a combination of Viagra1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (checkpoint therapeutics) is currently in clinical trials for cancers. Furthermore, back in 2009, a group at Columbia University reported that Viagra1 (3 mg/kg i.p.) effectively restores memory loss in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model of mice [39] . Because AD is also among the PAK1-dependent diseases, these findings strongly suggest that Viagra1 is a potent PAK1 blocker already on the market. Interestingly, unlike a more potent HDAC inhibitor FK228 (brand name Istodax1), which unfortunately fails to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), Viagra1 is able to cross the BBB effectively, and therefore could be potentially useful for therapy of a wide variety of PAK1-dependent neuronal diseases. It is also predicted that Viagra1 could contribute to the extension (improvement) of our healthy lifespan, in particular of males, if it is properly used.",

Interestingly, several PAK1 blockers such as triptolide, curcumin, resveratrol and melatonin have been shown to suppress the expression of PD-L1, strongly suggesting that PD-L1 expression might depend on PAK1 [40] .

If this working hypothesis is proven, it is most likely that 15 K could be a more effective (safer and less expensive as well) therapeutic than the Nobel-prize-winning monoclonal-based (checkpoint) therapeutics that have never worked for the treatment of brain tumors and pancreatic cancers.",

Traditionally, a specific vaccine would be the way forward to combat viral diseases. However, it would take at least 6 months (and realistically 18 months) to prepare a vaccine (according to WHO). Until that time, it was feared the majority of coronavirus victims would perish. However, very recently, a team at University Colorado found that a tumor-suppressing phosphatase called phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which inactivates PAK1, could suppress the coronavirus-caused CCL2dependent fibrosis of lungs [44] . Furthermore, a Viagra1 blocks p21-activated kinase (PAK)1 by downregulating histone deacetylases (HDACs).",

Malaria infection requires PAK1 in host cells [6] , and chloroquine upregulates p21 (a CDK inhibitor) whose expression is suppressed by PAK1 [6, 47] . Its anticoronaviral effect was recently confirmed in vitro by a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences as well (https://www.nature.com/ articles/s41422-020-0282-0/). Thus, these encouraging findings altogether strongly suggest, albeit not yet proven clinically, that PAK1 blockers such as propolis and chloroquine currently available on the market could be potentially useful for treating or easing the pandemic coronavirus infection, until its vaccine becomes available.",

However, in a common sense it would be very difficult to imagine that a given compound inhibits only PAK1, and not any other kinases or enzymes. Instead, here we have emphasized a chemical evolution of pre-existing natural or synthetic compounds known to inhibit PAK1 directly or upstream enzymes; but without any side effect in vivo (in small animals such as C. elegans and mice). This approach could boost either their cell permeability, water solubility or metabolism resistance. In a sense this 'wise' (reasonably flexible) approach simply follows the million-plus years of history regarding our own genetic and cultural evolution from primates that Charles Darwin revealed >150 years ago. Lastly it should be highlighted that the major purpose of PAK1 blockers for clinical application is to reduce the abnormally activated PAK1 to the 'normal' level (instead of 'null' level) in patients suffering from PAK1-dependent diseases. Thus, it is very unlikely that such a cautious measure or approach would cause any serious side effect.",
