India witnessed economic growth, rapid expansion of cities, industrialization, and fast-paced development of infrastructure since liberalization during the 1990s. Simultaneously, the level of air pollution in India has increased to a major health risk and cause of large premature mortality. Approximately one million people died in 2015 due to ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution alone in India (Guo et al., 2017). Indian cities have been always making into the top 20 most polluted cities of the world for the past few years and exceeding the ambient air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) (Garaga et al., 2018; Kota et al., 2018; Mukherjee and Agrawal, 2018).",

To control the severe air pollution in the country, the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) launched a five-year action plan was launched in 2019 with a goal of reducing PM by 30% nationwide (MoEFC, 2019). Are effective strategies followed up by efficient implementation can reduce the air pollution as expected? It is an open question as atmospheric processes that determine concentrations of air pollutants are nonlinear and changing meteorology plays significant roles in pollution formation. For example, the Chinese five year clean air action plan resulted in improved air quality in China (J. Li et al., 2019). However, the peak PM2.5 concentrations during episodes in winter did not reduce due to unfavourable meteorology (Wang et al., 2019). Similarly, Zhang et al. (2014) estimated ~33% reduction in nitrate in eastern US by emission control was offset by meteorology. A simulation done in China showed that metrology played very important role in air pollution formation and severe air pollution was not avoided during the lockdown in January and February 2020 (Wang et al., 2020).",

This has resulted in lockdown in many nations worldwide. While, the first confirmed case in India was on January 30th, 2020, the first international travel advisory posing restrictions on travel to China, Republic of Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan was issued on March 11th of after the country saw sudden jump in COVID-19 cases on March 4th (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). Southern state of India, Kerala, which was initially the most effected state imposed curtails on mass gatherings on March 10th. Starting from March 16th all places of mass gatherings such as institutions, shopping malls and theatres were closed across the country. The first nationwide lockdown for fourteen hours was on March 22nd, which was followed by 21 days lockdown starting from March 24th. This lockdown enforces restrictions and self-quarantine measures, which reduce emissions from transportation and industries. The changes in air pollution in this lockdown period can provide an insight into the achievability of air quality improvement when there are significant restrictions in emissions from many sources and gives regulators better plans to control air pollution.",

The details of AQI are available elsewhere (CPCB, 2014; Sahu and Kota, 2017), and only briefly summarized here. AQI uses PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3, CO, SO2, NH3 and Pb, of which minimum concentrations three pollutants should be available, with at least one being either PM2.5 or PM10. The concentrations are converted to a number on a scale of 0\u2013500. The sub index AQI (AQIi) for each pollutant(i) is calculated using Eq. (1)\n(1)AQIi=INHI\u2212INLOBHI\u2212BLO\u00d7Ci\u2212BLO+INLOwhere, Ci is the concentration of pollutant \u2018i\u2019; BHI and BLO are breakpoint concentrations greater and smaller to Ci and INHI and INLO are corresponding AQI values. The overall AQI is the maximum AQIi, and the corresponding pollutant is the dominating pollutant. The AQI is divided into five categories: good, satisfactory, moderate, poor, very poor and severe depending on whether the AQI falls between 0\u201350, 51\u2013100, 101\u2013200, 201\u2013300, 301\u2013400 and 401\u2013500, respectively.",

Increases in O3 and CO and decreases in NO and NO2 were observed in central India. Most cities in northern, western and southern regions are VOC limited (Sharma et al., 2016), thus this increase in O3 could be due to more decrease in NOx compared to VOC. Furthermore, this could also be attributed to decrease in PM concentrations, which can result in more sunlight passing through atmosphere encouraging more photochemical activities and thus higher O3 production (Dang and Liao, 2019; K. Li et al., 2019).",

Similar lockdown in China did not result in significant improvement in air quality due to unfavourable meteorology (Wang et al., 2020). To understand this effect, two simulations were carried out. While in Simulation 1 the actual meteorology during the analysis period in 2020 was used, in Simulation 2 the meteorology pertaining to worst case during early November of 2019 was used (Beig et al., 2020). In both cases the emissions from all sources but energy, residential and windblown dust in Delhi NCR was zeroed out to predict PM2.5. The model performance in 30 observations stations in the city are shown in Table 1\n. Results indicate that except in eight sites, the mean fractional bias (MFB) falls under the USEPA criteria of \u00b10.6 (EPA, 2007). The relative change in concentration in Simulation 2 compared to Simulation 1 is also included in Table 1. In 24 sites an increase in concentration was observed due to unfavourable meteorology. On an average the concentration in Simulation 2 in sites with good model performance increased by 33% compared to Simulation 1. This indicates that even the meteorology was not favourable, the average daily PM2.5 concentration in Delhi-NCR would increase to 54 \u03bcgm\u22123, which is less than the CPCB standard (60 \u03bcgm\u22123) and 1.13 times more than the corresponding WHO standard. However, this increase might not be accurate in the air pollution episode during November, even though similar restrictions on human activities are implemented, as the residential emissions increase in north India mainly due to space heating (Guo et al., 2017).",

Among all pollutants, PM2.5 had maximum reduction in most regions. In contrary, in most regions an increase in O3 was observed, which could be due to the decrease in PM in addition to decrease in NOx. This substantial reduction in concentrations resulted in a 4 times reduction in ER. As expected, a significant reduction in AQI was observed in 2020 compared to previous years. However, four cities had O3 as their dominant pollutant instead of PM2.5, suggesting that attention should also be given to decreasing emissions of precursors to secondary pollutants in addition to controlling primary PM. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years. Further analysis on actual and unfavourable meteorology using WRF-AERMOD modelling system concluded that even the predicted PM2.5 could increase due to unfavourable meteorology, the average concentration would still be under CPCB limits. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that a significant improvement in air quality in India could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented.",
