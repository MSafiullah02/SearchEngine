The number of critical care beds required in a pandemic has been estimated using several models. The assumption is that peak demand for critical care beds will significantly exceed capacity.32 There is a risk that an increase in the virulence of the virus will mean a huge increase in demand for critical care.33 DOH guidance clearly acknowledges that previous emergency planning advice to achieve a 100% increase beyond normal critical care bed capacity is not likely to meet demand.37 It is estimated that at the peak of the pandemic, the requirement for mechanical ventilation may exceed available beds 10-fold.25 When resources are limited, it is ethically reasonable to aim for the maximum benefit for the most people.2 Applying this principle, critical care services should be used preferentially for patients most likely to benefit. Despite understanding the necessity for triage criteria when resources are scarce to allocate access to critical care, HCWs find the idea morally challenging and legally ambiguous. Withdrawing care from an established critical care patient with uncertain outcome for the benefit of other individuals, so-called \u2018reverse triage\u2019 is particularly testing.

            "text": "However, there are no universally agreed procedures to triage and prioritize admission to critical care. The UK pandemic flu surge plan uses a staged triage scheme.73 This is based on the Canadian expert panel's plan to triage admissions into and out of critical care units. Their plan uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score;79 combined with a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria for admission to the critical care unit as a triage tool to augment clinical judgement.15 The scoring is simple, easily reproducible, and based on physiological parameters. It has been validated in a number of different critical illnesses and has good correlation with predicted and observed outcome.5\n38\n78 The use of a protocol like this may improve appropriate use of resources and help modify the stress of ad hoc clinical resource allocation. The protocol inclusion criteria are based on the need for single organ support (most benefit for respiratory failure) or a SOFA score of 7 or above. The exclusion criteria include a SOFA score of 11 or above (predicted mortality 90%) and severe or advanced disease states that usually preclude admission to an ICU.68\n69\n72 The appropriateness of critical care referral is judged on the initial SOFA score. On occasions when the score and clinical assessment appear conflicting, additional review by an experienced clinician is recommended. The minimum requirement for survival requires reassessment of SOFA scores at 48 and 120 h to determine response to treatment. Those not improving at this point are felt likely to have a poor outcome. A SOFA score of 11 or above at any point after 48 h can also be used as a cut-off and critical care withdrawal considered, so that resources can be redirected to other patients who may have a better response. Concurrent global assessment of the patient by an experienced intensive care clinician should occur; withdrawal based solely on the score achieved is not advocated. Most clinicians would aim to avoid triage by increasing capacity by accepting a decrease in quality of care and an increase in rate of critical care transfers.",
