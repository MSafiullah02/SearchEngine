            "text": "The European Virus Archive (EVA) was created in 2008 with funding from the FP7-EU Infrastructure Programme, in response to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organisations and industry (Gould et al., 2012). Within three years, it developed from a consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy. Following the H2020, 2014 call for Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS projects) the concept of developing the EVA into a global organization was a natural progression and the project was funded for a four-year period. In April 2015, the EVAg started to operate as a non-profit consortium including 26 partners and 20 associated partners from 21 EU and non-EU countries. Based on excellent progress during the first two operational years, we have every reason to believe that the consortium will continue to expand and will ultimately constitute the world's largest virus collection. In this paper, we outline the structure, management and goals of the EVAg, to bring to the attention of researchers the wealth of products it can provide and to illustrate how end-users can gain access to these resources.",

This represented a pioneering era in the development of medical and veterinary virology. Over the years, diagnostic and research centres were established worldwide to investigate viruses causing a wide range of diseases including those that had hitherto escaped all attempts to be identified and cultured under laboratory conditions. In the 21st century, ever-growing numbers of mammalian viruses continue to be isolated. They may represent only the tip of the iceberg, as more viruses are being discovered and reported using rapidly developing molecular technologies.",

Many of the known viruses are in collections that may be lost or discarded when the virologist in charge retires or when a laboratory closes or is reorganized. Other collections may not be available to the wider virology community, because scientists are not always willing or in a position to share their viral isolates. They may lack the infrastructure, time (manpower), facilities and experience to characterize and present their collection in an accessible catalogue and further be able to ship their collected strains to foreign countries due to the restraints imposed by increasingly complex transportation regulations. Furthermore, many governments have introduced additional security measures that specifically regulate the transfer and/or exchange, between countries, of high-risk-group pathogens that may attract the interest of terrorist organisations. Additionally, laboratories in Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia and South America hold their own virus collections, many of which, to date, have been relatively inaccessible to European laboratories. Viruses from many taxonomic families have also been identified on the African continent and some well-developed laboratories in Africa have made their collections readily accessible to researchers in Europe and the Americas. Currently, however, except for a few countries, including Senegal, South Africa and Kenya, authenticated virus collections from other regions of Africa are virtually non-existent.",

The current project aims at the development of virus collections in low-income countries where, in some cases, there has been an understandable reluctance to exchange viruses for fear of losing their resource to institutes from more highly developed countries. The EVAg infrastructure provides assured access to modern capacities, thereby assisting these institutes to train their staff in developing their own resources and expanding and maintaining these capacities locally. End-user requests for viruses and reagents from these developing laboratories will be entirely managed from within, but supported by the quality management and distribution systems of the consortium. In common with all other members of the consortium, these developing laboratories will automatically retain full ownership of their collections.",

For example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintain large collections of mammalian viral pathogens, including Risk Group 4 (RG4) agents. Laboratories in Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand hold collections that have been isolated specifically in their countries. Relatively large collections of arboviruses are currently held in the USA (Galveston National Laboratory, Texas), France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and also in some countries of Scandinavia. European collections of specified animal pathogens, particularly lyssaviruses, pestiviruses, arboviruses and influenza viruses are maintained at the Animal and Plant Health Agency and at The Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom; in Italy at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe) hosting the World Organization for Animal Health/Food and Agriculture Organization (OIE/FAO) and EU reference laboratory for avian influenza; and in France at the Institut Pasteur. RG4 viruses such as Ebola and Nipah are maintained in specialised facilities in France, Germany Russia, the USA, China, South Africa and the UK. Diverse viruses of medical or veterinary importance (coronaviruses, herpesviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, etc.) are held in laboratories around the world. As the EVAg continues to develop and to expand its boundaries, access to a greater proportion of these viruses will be enabled where possible.",

In fact, besides the EVAg, we are unaware of any non-profit organization that is concerned with facilitating reliable access globally to viruses and associated reagents from individual virus collections for research and/or diagnostic laboratories, teaching centres or industries involved in the production of diagnostic reagents, pharmaceuticals and vaccines solely for the benefit of science, in a safe and carefully regulated manner. It would be virtually impossible to establish a single laboratory to maintain supplies of all recognised pathogenic mammalian viruses. Based on the knowledge and experience gained from the former EVA project, we have addressed these problems by using web-based tools to centralise access to quality-controlled, standardised preparations of viruses held in laboratories worldwide. The underlying concept is simple, but because virologists are naturally protective of their collections, its success has required a paradigm shift in the mind-set of the partners or associated partners in the individual laboratories.",

The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of this approach concerning both the collaborative exchanges related to development of a common infrastructure and the operational effectiveness of resource distribution. From the point of view of scientific collaboration, the process was established rapidly and functioned efficiently. However, standardisation of the procedure for the distribution of materials to end-users proved to be challenging, and it is still being developed and improved within the current consortium. The reason for this slow progress is almost entirely due to the complexity of national regulations. Whilst the European Regulations retain the principle of being national and are enforced primarily to control the circulation of pathogens, they have been developed to maintain uniformity throughout the EU countries. Thus, the administrative pathway to obtaining authorisation for an exchange of resources between, for example, France and Germany or the Netherlands and Italy are very similar and are principally based on agreements provided by the National Biosafety Agencies. In contrast, the process of exchanging resources between the EU and Russia or between the EU and the USA involves many more constraints: the intervention of different administrations in processing authorisation for delivery of hazardous goods including, biosafety agencies, customs administration, commerce and trade administration, ministry of health, etc. (Also, the law in Russia does not permit the import or export of pathogens.) Nevertheless, our expertise in overcoming these hurdles is exemplified by the report of studies on the RG4 virus Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in which the virus was supplied by a European partner to an end-user in the USA (Haddock et al., 2018). Not surprisingly, when Zika virus emerged in South America and was found to be responsible for microcephaly, we received numerous requests for Zika virus, and many papers have been published with recognition of the EVAg as the source of virus. Five examples encompassing, i) simultaneous transmission with chikungunya virus, ii) diagnosis, iii) signal processing pathways, iv) pathogenesis in relation to foetal infections and v) virus structure, are cited here (Goertz et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016; Sirohi et al., 2016).",

Future financial planning also includes the creation of a specific interface between the industrial sector and the consortium. In the first instance, this interface will explore bi-directional opportunities to organize scientific exchanges, priority access to bio-resources including reference material development of diagnostic services, validation of diagnostic assays and commercialization by industrial partners to the benefit of both parties.

Subsequently, subject to continuation of funding and the appropriate justification, the EVAg aims to extend the diversity of its disciplines to encompass fish, plant, bacterial, fungal, protist and other currently unrecognised viruses. This will be achieved first through expansion within the European Community, followed by integration of specialist laboratories in the Americas, Russia, Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and Africa. The recently created African CDC will provide a unique opportunity to establish strong links with public health institutes in Africa. The substance of this relationship will be based on trust and mutual benefit. For instance, training workshops and staff exchanges will be organized with the objective of developing appropriate infrastructures that can be directly integrated into the EVAg format and the levels of scientific expertise and quality and range of products that will justify their integration into EVAg as full partners within the consortium.",
