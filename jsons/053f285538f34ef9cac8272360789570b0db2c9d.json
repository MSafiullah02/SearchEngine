In brief, the process is as follows: the system was equilibrated under operating parameters and then the pure solvent was sprayed in order to saturate with them the supercritical (SC) CO 2 flow. Immediately after the solvent, the system was supplied with the arbidol solution. After spraying the necessary amount of arbidol, the spray nozzle was purged for some time with the pure solvent to wash the supply line and complete the arbidol addition to the system. Thereafter, the SC CO 2 flow was maintained in the system under the operating conditions to elute the organic solvent residue from the system. The washing time was defined as the time required for pumping 1-2 volumes of the precipitation vessel at the given mass flow rate and density of the fluid. The arbidol precipitation was performed at 40\u00b0C, a pressure of 15 MPa, a solution flow rate of 1 mL/min, and a CO 2 flow rate of 50 g/min. The diameter of the hole of the spray nozzle was 100 \u03bcm.",

The anisotropic particles with either acicular or irregular structure were obtained in all studied conditions with methanol. In this paper, speaking about the size of these particles, we have in mind the length of the particle in the most extended direction. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the average particle length in the solution on the arbidol concentration. Three areas can be distinguished on this graph: (1) the region of a sharp fall of the particle length with increasing concentration (the range from 6.25 to 25 g/L); (2) the region of a soft fall of the length (from 25 to 75 g/L); (3) the region of the particle size growth with increasing concentration (from 75 to 200 g/L). In the first region there is rather sharp decrease in the average length of the arbidol particles with increasing concentration. When the concentration changes from 6.25 to 25 g/L the average particle size falls about 65 times: from 450 to 40 \u03bcm. When the concentrations of 6.25 and 12.5 g/L are used, the particles of a larger size than the Arbidol crystals before the SAS precipitation are formed. In the second region (25-75 g/L) the particle size also decreases with increasing concentration, but much more gradually: from 40 to 7 \u03bcm. The minimum of this dependence under the studied conditions is observed at the concentration of 75 g/L. The average size begins to increase with further increasing concentration. The average size of particles was equal to 35 \u03bcm at the maximum concentration used (200 g/L).",

Similar observations were made, for example, in the paper [12] , wherein the micronization of the pharmaceutical substance risperidone was performed using the method of supercritical antisolvent precipitation. We hypothesize that this dependence is due to the fact that in the case of a more dilute solution, when mixing the solution and SC CO 2 , the degree of supersaturation is very low, and therefore the nucleation rate is also small, and the growth process of already formed nuclei dominates. As the arbidol concentration rises in the solution, the instantaneous degree of supersaturation increases when mixing the methanol solution with supercritical CO 2 , and the rate of nucleation increases proportionally. The crystal growth occurs on a greater number of crystallization nuclei, which defines a smaller average particle size.",

We hypothesize that the third region of the dependence corresponds to the situation when the volume content of crystal nuclei becomes so large that the growth of these nuclei does not takes place in isolation from each other, and proceeds in such a way that the bridges between the initially discrete nuclei grow and, as a result, connect them together. This assumption is evidenced by either the fact that the dependence of the particle size on the concentration changes its character or a qualitative change in the morphology of the particles. Figures 2a and 2b shows photomicrographs of the Arbidol particles after micronization from the methanol solution (6.25 g/L). As can be seen, the arbidol morphology changes significantly after the antisolvent precipitation: the particles have a pronounced anisot- RUSSIAN When the solution concentration increases up to 25 g/L the form of the arbidol particles remains unchanged: the needles are formed, although of a significantly smaller size (length 20-110 \u03bcm, thickness 5 \u03bcm) than that at the concentration of 6.25 g/L (Fig. 3a) . A gradual change in the particle morphology is observed at the concentration of 50 g/L (Fig. 3b) : the fragments of irregular shape along with the needles are clearly seen on the photomicrographs (SEM); they have more pronounced structure irregularity compared with the needles.

Figure 4 shows the Two regions in the graph of the dependence of the average particle on the concentration can be distinguished for DMSO solutions. The first region, corresponding to the concentration from 6.25 to 50 g/L, is characterized by a decrease in the arbidol particle size with increasing concentration. In the second region (50 to 200 g/L), in contrast, the particle size increases with increasing concentration. However, in contrast to methanol, it is clearly seen that in the region of initial concentrations in the case of DMSO there is no sharp decrease in the particle size with increasing concentration. In the concentration range of 6.25-50 g/L, a relatively weak (compared with methanol) reduction in the particle size (from 9 to 1.8 \u03bcm) occurs. Apparently, this is due to a lower solubility of the CO 2 -DMSO mixture towards arbidol compared with the CO 2methanol mixture and, hence, a higher degree of supersaturation at low arbidol concentrations. Proba- bly, dependences similar to the first region of the concentration curve for the methanol solutions will be observed under further decrease in the arbidol concentration in DMSO or decrease in the ratio of DMSO and SC CO 2 mass flows.",

From the presented data we can conclude that the type of the solvent has a determining influence on the morphology of the obtained arbidol particles. In contrast to the particles obtained by the precipitation from methanol solutions, for methanol, the typical needles are not formed in the studied concentration range when using DMSO. In the case of DMSO there are various fragments of an irregular shape, often having a high anisotropy. In general, a wide variation in the shape is typical for the particles precipitated from DMSO. The search for correlation between the morphology of the particles and the arbidol concentration in DMSO in severely hindered, i.e., explicit dependence between the form of the precipitated particles and the arbidol content in the solution was not established.",

            "text": "The development of methods for obtaining arbidol complexes with bioresorbable polymers in order to produce a pharmaceutical form of the drug with prolonged action will be a further direction of the present work. Currently, various candidates for the role of bioresorbable polymer support, such as copolymers of lactic and glycolic acids, poloxamers, polyanhydrides, alkyl derivatives of cellulose, etc., are considered. The search for the most effective combination of the polymer with arbidol is a complex multiparameter task; it is very labor-intensive. A high-performance rapid method for producing test batches of AFI complexes with polymers is required to carry out this study. Previously, it has repeatedly been demonstrated that the SAS method is well suited for rapid screening of crystallization conditions for different pharmaceutical substances, including the search for optimal conditions for preparing cocrystals [13] or various polymorphic forms of API [14] . We suggest that the SAS method may be used just as effectively for screening AFI complexes with bioresorbable polymers. The regularities of arbidol crystallization during the SAS process, disclosed in the present work, will be taken into (c) account in the future study. The found values of the concentrations, corresponding to the minimum in the concentration dependences, will serve as a starting point during the development of polymer/arbidol coprecipitation methods. CONCLUSIONS Thus, the possibility of obtaining Arbidol microparticles of different sizes and morphology was demonstrated by supercritical antisolvent precipitation. The effect of the solvent and arbidol concentration in the solution on the micronization results was considered. It was shown that the dependence of the average particle size on the substance concentration in the sprayed solution is nonmonotonic. An increase in the concentration results in a decrease in the particle size until a certain threshold value; the trend is reversed when this threshold is reached. This threshold value depends on the type of organic solvent. The values of the concentrations, at which the crystal size is minimal, were found. The dependence of the crystal morphology on the arbidol concentration in the sprayed solution is also nonmonotonic. The inflection of the curve on the concentration dependence graphs is probably due to particle fusion.",
