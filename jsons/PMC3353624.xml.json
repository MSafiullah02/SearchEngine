The hallmark of chronic hepatitis C is the presence of anti-HCV and HCV RNA in serum for more than 6 months after acute infection.[23]",

Additionally, some of these cytokines may have a fibrogenic (e.g., TGF-\u03b2) or an antifibrogenic role (e.g., IFN-\u03b3).[7] Some authors have suggested that a preferential shift towards either Th1 or Th2 response may influence the clinical outcome and disease progression.[8\u201312]",

However, it is apparent that the expression of IL-2 is associated with a more advanced stage of disease.[26\u201328] Napoli et al. in 1996 demonstrated that as liver injury worsens, there is an increase in intrahepatic Th1-like cytokine m-RNA levels.

This could be, possibly, due to the predominant Th2; IL-4 in occult HCV that may be responsible for persistence of infection in these patients, agreeing with reports from other authors.[627] It has been proposed that the inability to terminate HCV infection may also result from the inappropriate release of some T-cell and monocyte-macrophage-derived cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10.[3637] These cytokines may inhibit cellular-mediated antiviral responses by interfering with T-cell activation and function.[38\u201341] These data probably, expressing the situation in our work, where undetectable serum HCV-RNA in case of occult HCV infection, can explain the low level of Th1 cytokines in this study, among such patients than those with chronic HCV infection. The existence of a relationship between chronic HCV replication and Th1 predominance was further supported by the finding of marked decrease in the Th1 response in patients in whom the HCV-RNA titer dropped to undetectable levels following in vivo IFN-\u03b3 parenteral manipulations.[4243]",
