Six weeks later, the outbreak was categorized as a pandemic. COVID-19 has already caused 24 times more cases (as of 18 March 2020) than the previous coronavirus-induced PHEIC\u2014the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak\u2014and the COVID-19 numbers are expected to grow. Compared with the 2002\u20132003 outbreak, however, the COVID-19 emergency is occurring in a much more digitized and connected world. The amount of data produced from the dawn of humankind through 2003 is generated today within a few minutes. Furthermore, advanced computational models, such as those based on machine learning, have shown great potential in tracing the source or predicting the future spread of infectious diseases1,2. It is therefore imperative to leverage big data and intelligent analytics and put them to good use for public health.",

China, the country most affected by COVID-19, is reportedly using ubiquitous sensor data and health-check apps to curb the disease spread7. According to a New York Times report8, there is little transparency in how these data are cross-checked and reused for surveillance purposes. For example, the report said that Alipay Health Code, an Alibaba-backed government-run app that supports decisions about who should be quarantined for COVID-19, also seems to share information with the police8. In Italy, the European country recording the largest number of COVID-19 cases, the local data-protection authority was urged, on 2 March 2 2020, to issue a statement to clarify the conditions of lawful data use for mitigation and containment purposes. In its statement, the authority warned against the privacy-infringing collection and processing of data by non-institutional actors (e.g., private employers).",

However, compelling providers to allow access to or even assist in decrypting cryptographically protected data (similar to what occurred during the 2016 US Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2013Apple encryption dispute) may be counterproductive, especially if the agreements between (inter)national authorities and service providers lack transparency or proportion.

This risk of mistrust is even greater in countries in which citizens place a much lower level of trust in their government, such as Italy, France and the USA11. Therefore, whenever access to these data sources is required and is deemed proportional, the public should be adequately informed. Secrecy about data access and use should be avoided.
