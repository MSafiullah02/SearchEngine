Speculated mechanisms include coagulopathy, splenic sequestration of injured platelets, bone-marrow alterations, platelet aggregation, antibody-mediated platelet destruction and oxidative stress [3, 25]. Association of cell-mediated immune cells, such as interlukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and thrombocytopaenia have been documented in various studies [3, 26\u201328]. There is a paucity of baseline data on various aspects of P. vivax, including cytokine profile, correlation of immunological response and haematological manifestations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine and correlate baseline levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 in healthy controls and thrombocytopaenic P. vivax-infected patients from southern Pakistan. The cytokines data presented in this study is part of ongoing project previously published baseline profiles of biomarkers in malaria patients. (37) In this study cytokine data was used for correlation with thrombocytopaenia.",

Furthermore, cytokines levels were correlated with thrombocytopaenia status in complicated cases to determine whether complex interactions exist between these molecules and manifestations of disease symptoms in thrombocytopaenic P. vivax cases. In this study, thrombocytopaenia was detected in all cases. Moderate and profound thrombocytopaenia was most frequently observed (51.1 and 43.4%, respectively) while mild thrombocytopaenia was observed in only 5.5% of the patients. This finding is consistent with previously reported observations from South America and south Asia where P. vivax is endemic [2]. Clinical complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), platelet associated IgG increase (PAIgG), immune thrombocytopaenia purpura (ITP), acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema, splenomegaly, cerebral malaria, and seizures have been reported in P. vivax cases exhibiting profound thrombocytopaenia [15\u201319, 21]. In these cases, bleeding was observed in a few cases, indicating that thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax does not always lead to bleeding complications. In this study, complications including metabolic acidosis, pulmonary oedema, jaundice, haemglobunuria were observed in 45% (82/182) of the patients. Of these, profound thrombocytopenia was observed in 18% of the patients of which 11.2% suffered from respiratory distress/pulmonary oedema, while 6.8% suffered from metabolic acidosis. Moderate thrombocytopenia was observed in the remaining cases. Bleeding was observed infrequently in complicated cases exhibiting profound thrombocytopenia indicating that P. vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia in Pakistan demonstrates a similar trend of low bleeding tendencies as observed worldwide.",

A significant increase of TNF level was observed between uncomplicated and complicated cases exhibiting profound thrombocytopenia while no significant difference was observed between healthy controls and mild cases. This finding corroborates with previously reported data in which thrombocytopaenia was observed in patients exhibiting high TNF levels [33]. It has been postulated that TNF induced thrombocytopaenia is a result of platelet trapping and consumption that occurs in inflamed blood vessels [34]. In P. falciparum, this process is well documented and has been associated with immunologically mediated endothelial activation that allows platelet adherence via endothelial adhesion molecules on the blood lining [35]. In P. vivax, thrombocytopaenia due to platelet consumption via endothelial adherence/destruction and coagulopathy has also been documented [36, 37]. Elevated levels of TNF in this study imply a similar role of this cytokine in P. vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia. However, further studies are required to understand the role of TNF in platelet consumption.",

Furthermore, administration of IL-6 in humans has been associated with increase in circulating platelet counts [43\u201349].

This finding corroborates with previously reported data that reports elevated IL-10 levels in malaria thrombocytopaenia [3, 25, 33]. Furthermore, decreased platelet production in humans in response to administration of recombinant IL-10 has also been documented. The same study postulated that IL-10-induced reduction in platelet count is possibly due to reduction in platelet production [50]. It is possible that similar mechanism of reduced platelet production due to high IL-10 levels is responsible for P. vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia in this study. Regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, are required to reduce the risk of severe disease or more tissue injury in malaria. Therefore, intrinsic IL-10 response induced in response to protecting the host against injury results in down regulation of platelet production mechanisms, thus leading to manifestation of thrombocytopaenia.",

It was observed that negative correlation existed between IL-6 and IL-10 in both moderate and profound cases indicating that as IL-10 levels increase, IL-6 levels decrease leading to reduction/disturbance in platelet production. Consequently, this elevated anti-inflammatory bias results in aggravation of thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax cases. A significant positive correlation between IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 in profound cases further strengthens the role of respective cytokines in platelet consumption, trapping and dysregulation of platelet production. Thus, findings from this study corroborate previously reported data and indicate a possible role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in manifestation of thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria.",

Secondly, parasitaemias and patient data, such as days of fever and temperature at admission, was not documented and, therefore, could not be used for analysis as done previously in other studies [5, 51, 52]. Hence, it was not possible to evaluate differences in parasitaemia in relation to thrombocytopaenia and cytokine levels. Furthermore, some studies have also reported age to significantly affect platelet count in malaria patients. In this study, the average age of the patients was between 33\u201342 years. Since no significant differences with respect to age were observed therefore data was not analyzed for age. However, to better understand the dynamics of thrombocytopenia and cytokine levels future studies focusing on all these aspects in P. vivax is suggested.",
