The coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated COVID-19), has rapidly swept across the world [3], with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it a pandemic on March 11. Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread internationally, with 2,394,278 of confirmed cases and 164,937 deaths worldwide on April 17 [4]. In Brazil, on the same date, the total confirmed cases were 38,654, with 2,462 deceased [4]. In the state of Cear\u00e1, located at the northeastern part of Brazil, the more recent official report showed 3,306 cases confirmed, with 189 deaths, a mortality rate of 5.7%. That brings Cear\u00e1 to a preoccupying third place, when comparing other states of Brazil, regarding the number of confirmed cases so far [5].",

Such demand is particularly more difficult to manage in a developing country setting. In Brazil, where 74,8% of the population are solely assisted by the public health system, a shortage of ICU beds is expected to occur by the end of April in most major cities [16]. The developing of more affordable strategies to mitigate the spread of the pandemic in such scenarios must be of highest priority.",

Its metallic frame is fully autoclavable, as well as the high grammage plastic sheet used to cover it. Different acrylic prototypes have been recommended for use during tracheal intubation [13]. However, restricted hand movement and higher production costs may be a caveat. Also, those devices were not developed for use during surgical procedures. Our prototype, on the other hand, provides greater mobility, since the plastic sheet is more malleable, when comparing to more rigid structures such as acrylic. The metallic frame has also a curved shape on its sides where surgeons can be positioned closer to the patient without compromising safety, therefore preserving ergonomics. Ports are also fully customizable, since they are made by the surgical team right before the beginning of the operation.",

Possible areas of air escape may include the hand ports, as well as the bottom part of the device. Further experiment on aerosol spread while using the COVID-Box is needed, possibly with fluorescent dye [13]. Secondly, the correct time for removal of the device after tracheotomy is uncertain. Previous reports showed that bioaerosols may be in suspension for several hours [6,14]. Therefore, we strongly suggest leaving the box in place after the procedure, removing it only after 3 hours or longer. Perhaps, as other airway procedures should be performed after tracheotomy, such as pulmonary toilet, the device might be left positioned for longer periods. Also, a study comparing a regular open tracheotomy and one using the device may be necessary, maybe applying a comprehensive questionnaire to surgeons. Nevertheless, we found that the duration of the operation was not compromised by the use of the apparatus.",
