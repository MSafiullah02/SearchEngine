Members of the global radiation oncology community were invited to comment on issues relevant to the delivery of most effective care during the time of a global pandemic. The conversation was based around the themes of how to reduce transmission, mitigate consequences of reduced workforce and continue treatment in the presence of infection. Wakelet, a social media content organization platform, was used in real-time to summarize key insights to help guide the discussion and provide faster knowledge-sharing. Tweets were then reviewed and grouped into themes that formed the basis for these guidelines. A literature review supplemented data where available to expand on issues raised.

It has been used in successfully in patients with advanced cancer [10]. It is highly suitable for patients with comorbidities and difficulties with travel and is associated with high patient satisfaction [11], [12]. We recommend that wherever possible, consultations are moved to a remote monitoring or telephone alternative as quickly as possible to reduce unnecessary patient traffic through departments. Financial disincentives to telephone consultation should be removed from systems wherever possible.

When our treatments are accompanied by good quality evidence, we have good estimates of benefit and can consent with access to data on likely acute and long-term harms. The risk benefit ratio of treatment changes in the context of a pandemic. If the likelihood of serious infection increases or the likelihood of the outcome of that infection being more serious increases, then the risk may start to outweigh the benefit. Estimating the harms of COVID infection for cancer patients is currently difficult because there have been too few reported events for modelling. A simple model could use the risk of COVID infection multiplied by risk of serious morbidity/mortality. If a patient has a 5% risk of infection and 10% risk of death from infection there may be a 0.5% mortality through exposure and attendance for radiotherapy. If the patient is young and healthy with a 5% risk of infection and 1% risk of death, then there is 0.05% mortality from COVID-19. The use of chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy is likely to very significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from synchronous COVID-19 infection.",

If department size allows, then plan for a \u2018hot\u2019 bunker \u2013 a treatment machine where all potential COVID-19 infected or suspected infected cases are treated. Preferentially, route these patients through the department by separate entrance and exit (consider using emergency or rear exits as separate doorways for this group). These treatments should be concentrated at the end of the day so that adequate decontamination and cleaning procedures can take place overnight before treatments resume the next day. The patients should be asked to wear mask to avoid spreading infection by droplet and staff should all be fitted with appropriate PPE. Store fixation devices (breast boards, thermoplastic masks etc) used by infected patients should be stored separately from all other equipment.",
