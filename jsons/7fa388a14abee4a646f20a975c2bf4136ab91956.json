Existing similarity measures either consider only the co-rated items for a pair of users (but co-rated items are rare in real-world sparse datasets), or try to utilize the non-co-rated items via some heuristics. We propose a novel user distance measure, called Preference Mover's Distance (PMD), based on the optimal transportation theory. PMD exploits all ratings made by each user and works even if users do not share co-rated items at all. In addition, PMD is a metric and has favorable properties such as triangle inequality and zero self-distance. Experimental results show that PMD achieves superior recommendation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art similarity measures, especially on highly sparse datasets.",

            "text": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most widely used recommendation techniques [14, 47] . Given a user, CF recommends items by aggregating the preferences of similar users. Among CF recommendation approaches, methods based on nearest-neighbors (NN) are widely used, thanks to their simplicity, efficiency and ability to produce accurate and personalized recommendations [13, 35, 44] . Although deep learning (DL) methods [16, 19, 43] have attracted much attention in the recommendation community over the past few years, a very recent study [12] shows that NN-based CF is still a strong baseline and outperforms many DL methods. For NN-based methods, the user similarity measure plays an important role. It serves as the criterion to select a group of similar users whose ratings form the basis of recommendations, and is used to weigh users so that more similar users have greater impact on recommendations. Besides CF, user similarity is also important for applications such as link prediction [4] , community detection [34] and so on.",

Traditional similarity measures, such as cosine distance (COS) [9] , Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) [9] and their variants [18, 29, 38, 39] , have been widely used in CF [13, 44] . However, such measures only consider co-rated items and ignore ratings on other items, and thus may only coarsely capture users' preferences as ratings are sparse and co-rated items are rare for many real-world datasets [35, 40, 44] . Some other similarity measures, such as Jaccard [22] , MSD [39] , JMSD [8] , URP [27] , NHSM [27] , PIP [5] and BS [14] do not utilize all the rating information [6] . For example, Jaccard only uses the number of rated items and omits the specific rating values, while URP only uses the mean and the variance of the ratings. Critically, all these measures give zero similarity value when there are no co-rated items, which would harm recommendation performance. Recently, BCF [35] and HUSM [44] were proposed to alleviate the co-rating issue by modeling user similarity as a weighted sum of item similarities, where the weights are obtained using heuristics. As the weights are not derived in a principled manner, they do not satisfy important properties such as triangle inequality and zero self-distance, which are important for a high quality similarity measure.",

We propose the Preference Mover's Distance (PMD), which considers all ratings made by each user and is able to evaluate user similarity even in the absence of co-rated items. Similar to BCF and HUSM, PMD uses the item similarity as side information and assumes that if two users have similar opinions on similar items, then their tastes are similar. But the key difference is: PMD formulates the distance between a pair of users as an optimal transportation problem [26, 36] such that the weights for item similarities can be derived in a principled manner. In fact, PMD can be viewed as a special case of EMD [33, 37, 45] , which is a metric that satisfies important properties such as triangle inequality and zero self-distance. We also make PMD practical for large datasets by employing the Sinkhorn algorithm [10] to speed up distance computation and using HNSW [30] to further accelerate the search for similar users. Experimental results show that PMD leads to superior recommendation accuracy over the state-of-the-art similarity measures, especially on sparse datasets.",

Moreover, PMD is a metric as long as D is a metric [37] . We call d(p u , p v ) the preference mover's distance (PMD) to highlight its connection to EMD. Being a metric has some nice properties that make the user distance meaningful. For example, the triangle inequality indicates that if both user A and user B are similar to a third user C, then user A and user B are also similar. Moreover, a user should be most similar to himself among all users if D(i, i) = 0. In contrast, it is unclear whether BCF and HUSM also have these properties as they determine weights using heuristics. Illustration. Intuitively, d(p u , p v ) can be viewed as the minimum cost of transforming the ratings of user u to the ratings of user v, which we show in Fig. 1 . p u and p v define two distributions of mass, while D(i, j) models the cost of moving one unit of mass from p u (i) to p v (j). Therefore, PMD can model the similarity between u and v even if they have no co-rated items. If two users like similar items, W u,v (i, j) takes a large value for item pairs with small D(i, j), which results in a small distance. This is the case for u 0 and u 1 in Fig. 1 as they both like science fiction movies. In contrast, if two users like dissimilar items, W u,v (i, j) is large for item pairs with large D(i, j), which produces a large distance. In Fig. 1 , u 0 likes science fiction movies while u 2 likes romantic movies, and thus d(p u0 , p u2 ) is large. Even if u 0 has no co-rated movies with u 1 and u 2 , PMD still gives d(p u0 , p u1 ) < d(p u0 , p u2 ), which implies that u 0 is more similar to u 1 than to u 2 .",

We convert PMD into a similarity measure using s(u, v) = 2 \u2212 d(p u , p v ) and divide all ratings into train/validation/test sets, with an 8:1:1 ratio. Hyper-parameters are tuned to be optimal on the validation set for all methods. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) [15, 31, 32] of the predicted ratings on the test set are used to evaluate the recommendation performance. , j) ), which is a metric on the item space. For fair comparison, the same item similarity matrix is used for PMD, BCF and HUSM 1 . Comparison Methods. COS, PCC and MSD are three classical user similarity measures. Jaccard, JMSD, NHSM, BCF, HUSM are five state-of-the-art measures. NMF [28] , SVD [21] and SVD++ [20] are latent factor models for CF. We report the performance of various similarity measures in Table 3 , where PMD is based on Eq. (3) and CPMD is based on Eq. (4). The results show that PMD and CPMD consistently outperform other similarity measures and the improvement is more significant on the Epinions dataset which is much more sparse. We believe that our methods achieve good performance on sparse datasets mainly because it utilizes all rating information and derives the weights of the items using the optimal transportation theory, which works well when there are only few or no co-rated items. This is favorable as ratings are sparse in many real-world datasets [40] . CPMD achieves better performance than PMD, which suggests that it is beneficial to distinguish positive and negative feed-backs.",
