            "text": "Emerging viral diseases have great impact on community health in the recent years. During past four decades, many new viral out\u2010breaks have been documented in the different regions of the world. These outbreaks were due to some well\u2010known viral agents like Crimean\u2010Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, Lassa fever, Marburg virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.1 These viral outbreaks are accountable for considerable mortality, morbidity as well as great economic loss across the globe. Even old viruses like influenza are capable of reemerging and present new threats of the epidemic and pandemic. These viruses follow the different strategies for infecting humans either directly or through adaptation in the reservoir host animals. According to literature, since 1980 only 87 out of 1399 human pathogens have been found to infect humans directly while majority of them initially infect other susceptible animals which further spread the infection to humans.2 Nipah virus (NiV) is very notorious zoonotic type of pathogen, which belongs to genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae.3 NiV causes great spectrum of disease from mild to life\u2010threatening encephalitis or fatal respiratory illness in humans and animals.4 NiV was reported for the first time from Malaysian population in 1998.3, 4, 5, 6 In March 1999, a team of eminent virologists from the University of the Malaya isolated a virus from sample of a patient from Sungai Nipah (Nipah River Village) and named it as NiV.6, 7, 8 Antigenic, serological, and detailed molecular characterization of this newly isolated virus showed cross reaction with antibodies to the Hendra virus (HeV), the other member of genus Henipavirus. Further sequencing studies revealed that it is a new type of Paramyxovirus and is about 20% different from HeV in nucleotide homology.7, 8, 9\n",

            "text": "Nipah virus is an enveloped virus, pleomorphic in shape (40\u20101900 nm) having single\u2010stranded negative\u2010sense RNA genome.3, 10 Under electron microscope, NiV has similar morphological structure pattern as that of other members of Paramyxoviridae. NiV is placed along with HeV in the genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae as NiV showed 68% to 92% and 40% to 67% homology with HeV in protein\u2010coded regions and non\u2010translated regions, respectively.3, 7, 8, 9, 10 Like other Paramyxoviruses, NiV also has six genes which encode for fusion protein (F), glycoprotein (G), matrix protein (M), nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), and polymerase protein (L). Phosphoprotein (P) gene encodes various important accessory proteins known as C, V, and W.3, 11, 12 The C protein plays a very important role in regulation of viral RNA synthesis and virulence factor. V and W proteins are crucial for virulence, and these proteins act by inhibiting the activation of an interferon\u2010inducible promoter.11, 12 Strain variations have been observed between human NiV isolates collected from the outbreaks in Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh. Similarly, NiV virus isolates from bats samples which were collected from different geographical area also displayed genomic variation.12, 13, 14 NiV is a newly emerging virus, and also high containment facility is required for NiV study; therefore, limited data is available on virus replication, transcription, translation, and other mechanisms. In Paramyxoviridae family, NiV are closer to HeV as compared with other family members. Antibodies against NiV also cross\u2010react with HeV but not against other members of family.15 In contrast to other paramyxoviruses, genomes of NiV and HeV are much longer, ie, 18.2 and 15.5 kb, respectively. The P genes of both viruses are longer than other members of family.16, 17 Both of these viruses do not show the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities which are common features of other paramyxoviruses. And also, both these viruses have broad host range whereas other paramyxoviruses members have narrow host range.18, 19\n",

The Pteropus fruit bat, which is also known as the flying fox (order Chiroptera and genus Pteropus) considered as the natural animal reservoirs for NiV.4, 13 There are about 60 different species of these flying fox, which are found in Asia, China, Australia and some part of Africa as well as the Pacific Islands.20 Experimentally, it is yet to be confirmed whether these flying foxes develop sub\u2010clinical disease or not, after NiV infection to them.21, 22 Sero\u2010surveillance studies for NiV detection in flying foxes samples were conducted in Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Bangladesh, where 9% to 25% bats were found positive for the NiV.13, 23, 24, 25 The NiV were isolated from some flying fox urine samples collected from Malaysia and Cambodia.13, 26 In Malaysian outbreak, flying foxes acted as natural host for NiV, and pigs acted as a mediator host to humans. Pigs had been infected by indirect contact with NiV infected flying foxes in the endemic regions.27, 28 The outbreaks of NiV in human population have been documented from Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, and India. NiV has also been isolated and identified in flying foxes in Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, and Thailand.29 Until June 2018, five countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, and Philippines) are affected due to NiV which was responsible for 643 laboratory confirmed patients and at least 380 (59%) human deaths (Table 1).29 In Cambodia and Thailand, NiV were found only in flying foxes and no NiV infected human case was reported.13, 25 Direct contact with NiV infected pigs and their products were primarily responsible for the outbreak in Malaysia.28 While in case of Bangladesh and Indian NiV outbreaks, epidemiology was comparatively less well defined. NiV infect the human through the flying foxes and without the involvement of pigs while some evidences indicated person\u2010to\u2010person transmission of NiV.29, 30\n",

Another similar outbreak was observed in a town of Sikamat of state Negri Sembilan, Malaysia in December 1998 to January 1999.4, 5, 6 Third and largest outbreak with same symptom occurred in neighboring area of Bukit Pelandok (Malaysian) in December 1998.26, 27, 28 Initially, all these outbreaks were considered due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which was generally prevalent in these area.4, 29 In response to this, JEV vaccination and various steps for mosquito control were taken to manage these outbreaks but even after that the disease was expanding continuously.29 The epidemiological data showed that causative agent for these outbreaks was different from JEV because majority of patients were adult as compared with children. Previously, JEV immunized persons were also infected with new agent, and during animal surveillance there were sick pigs with severe barking cough and many dying from the same disease.4, 5, 6, 7, 8 A large number of infected individuals were adult males and were directly associated with pig farming. Pigs to human transmissions of NiV were observed in these outbreaks. Control steps like culling of pigs, avoid pig contact, and exchange of pig were taken in affected NiV areas and as a result the infection declined.7, 8, 9 During these outbreaks in Malaysia, a total of 265 Nipah encephalitis patients were confirmed out of which 105 (39.6%) deaths were reported.29 Although these outbreaks were comparatively small but mortality rates were very high led to the reason of panic in that area.28, 29 Various steps including ban on pig transport, public education, national surveillance, and pig culling were taken to control NiV outbreak. Pig farming is one of top industries in Malaysia, and more than one million pigs were culled during NiV outbreaks, resulted in an economic loss between $350 and $400 million.30 The NiV infection spread to Singapore due to import of infected pigs from infected area of Malaysia. In early March 1999, 11 pig farmers in Singapore were diagnosed NiV positive with one fatality. All those farmers were involved in the import of live pigs from NiV infected part of Malaysia and had close contact history with the infected pigs.4, 8 Singapore government took immediate and effective actions against the NiV outbreak including culling of pigs, avoiding contact with NiV infected pigs and also banning of import of pigs from Malaysia.4, 5, 6, 29 After these actions, outbreak was contained and last confirmed NiV case from Malaysia or Singapore was reported in May 1999.5, 6, 7, 8 These NiV outbreaks were very serious, and true numbers of infections may be uncertain due to large number of asymptomatic patients.26, 27, 28\n",

Eighteen patient samples were sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, and NiV was detected in five urine samples by RT\u2010PCR, while another nine serum/blood samples were found positive for NiV by IgM and IgG immunological assay.14 The outbreak was sudden and highly serious with 66 laboratory conformed patients of NiV encephalitis and at least 43 (68%) fatalities.29 As per patient observation and history, all the cases were adults without any history of pig or other animal exposure and some evidence of nosocomial transmission. No role of pigs in NiV infection transmission was found, and the outbreak spread mainly from person\u2010to\u2010person contact specifically in hospital settings. The second outbreak of NiV was surfaced during April, 2007 at village Belechuapara, near to Bangladesh border area in Nadia district of the West Bengal. This outbreak was limited to five persons only, but case fatality rate was 100% as all infected persons died within a week of infection.30, 31 Third and recent outbreak was reported from Kozhikode district of Kerala in southern part of India on 19 May 2018.31, 32, 33 This was the first experience of NiV outbreak in southern part of India. The outbreak started with the death of three individuals within a family. One health care worker involved in the treatment of these family members, also succumbed to infection.33 The cause of infection was thought to be the human intervention of habitat of bats. The samples of bats from Pteropus genus were collected from Kozhikode district and tested at National High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory, Bhopal. A total 10 (19.2%) samples out of 52 samples collected were found positive for NiV by RT\u2010PCR. The human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of infection occurred through droplet infection. The two costal districts (Kozhikode and Malappuram) of Kerala state were affected due to NiV. As per the reports of Directorate of Health Services, Kerala, there were 13 deaths out of 14 confirmed cases in Kozhikode district, and three deaths out of four confirmed cases were reported from Malappuram district.32 As on July 2018, the outbreak was responsible for 18 confirmed cases out of which 17 (94.4%) persons succumbed to the infection.31 World Health Organization helped Government of India by providing technical support to control the infection spread. World Health Organization did not recommended any restriction on travel, trade, or entry screening related to NiV outbreak. No new case of infection was reported after 1 June 2018, and as of 30 July 2018 the outbreak was contained in the state of Kerala.31 All these three NiV outbreaks were responsible for 89 laboratories confirmed cases including 67 (75.2%) deaths.29, 30, 31, 32, 33\n",

NiV are spreading in various parts of world, and it has the potential of causing severe outbreaks. There are no specific antiviral or vaccine are available for NiV, and only supportive treatment can be given to patents. The very first step in controlling of NiV outbreaks and lessen its impact is early detection. Therefore, continuous surveillance of animal reservoirs and community should be done which at high risk of NiV. Better strategies should be developed for effective management of the livestock especially near the habitats of bats. Also, people should be educated through different awareness programs about food and personal hygiene. Effective vaccination strategies must be developed in near future to combat the threat of infectious agents like NiV.",
