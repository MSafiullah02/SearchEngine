Despite a high variability, all carboxylate AUC0\u20138 in this study were >2,270 ng h/mL. In line with previous studies, tremendous carboxylate levels were found in a patient with decreased renal function, and doubling of the dose resulted in doubling of the exposure [2, 4]. However, if the standard dose of 75 mg twice daily had been administered to patient 4, exposure might have been below the previously established target AUC. This might be caused by an increased apparent distribution volume and an increased clearance during pregnancy, since the glomerular filtration rate may be increased by 50 % [5]. Additionally, a dose of 75 mg once daily resulted in adequate carboxylate exposure during CVVH (patient 2) in which up to fivefold increased AUCs have previously been observed [2].",
