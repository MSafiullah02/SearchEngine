It exhibits time-dependent pharmacodynamics (PD); the fraction of the dosing interval that free plasma concentrations are above the MIC (fT>MIC) is the PK/PD index that best describes its antimicrobial efficacy [2, 3]. Although the maximal bactericidal activity for meropenem has been associated with a fT>MIC of 40\u201350% [4], a higher pharmacodynamic target of 50\u2013100% fT>MIC has been suggested for critically ill patients [5]. Continuous (CI) (or extended) infusion of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics increases the fT>MIC and has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in some clinical studies [6\u20138]. The emergence of resistance is another important endpoint, so regimens must be designed to provide drug exposures that minimize the development of resistance [9, 10].",

Clinical cure was defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms present at enrolment and the resolution or lack of progression of radiological signs of pneumonia during follow-up (7 to 10 days after treatment initiation) [21]. Microbiological eradication was defined as the eradication of the microorganisms cultured from respiratory samples at baseline and at the end of treatment [22]. Seven and 30-day all-cause mortality was considered as death from any cause during the 7 or 30 days following the end of treatment, and in-hospital mortality was defined as death occurring during the hospital stay. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolated pathogens was determined using the Vitek2\u00ae automated system (Biomerieux, France) and interpreted according to EUCAST breakpoints (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) [23]. In a few cases, susceptibility was confirmed by E-test (Biomerieux, France). Adverse events potentially associated with meropenem were collected such as local (inflammation, pain, phlebitis or edema at the injection site), cutaneous (rash, pruritus), gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, constipation), neurological (headache, insomnia, agitation, delirium, confusion, dizziness, seizure, nervousness, paresthesia, hallucinations, somnolence), drug-induced liver injury (increased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin), or Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).",

Randomization was balanced (1:1) without blocks or stratification. All patients received meropenem (Meropenem Accordpharma\u00ae; Accord Healthcare, S.L.U. Barcelona, Spain) at an initial loading dose (LD) of 2 g (in 50 mL of 0.9% saline infused by a central line in 15 min) followed by a CI of 3 g or 6 g/day (1 g or 2 g of meropenem over 8 h every 8 h). Meropenem by CI was diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% saline solution and injected into a central venous catheter via a volumetric pump (Braum Mesulgen, Mesulgen, Germany) with an infusion dead space of < 2 mL [26]. A maximum infusion time of 8 h was chosen based on the available meropenem stability data [27] and a stability study performed in our laboratory to confirm the previous results (data not shown). All patients received empirical combination therapy with 3 MIU/8 h of nebulized colistimethate sodium (CMS) (Accord\u00ae, Accord Healthcare, Barcelona, Spain).

Our results suggest that an optimal PTA can be achieved for MIC values < 2 mg/L with a dose of 1 g/8 h and for MIC values < 4 mg/L with a higher dose of 2 g/8 h. A lower coverage (a lower MIC dilution) was reported with the use of the same doses of meropenem administered by extended infusion (over 3 h) in the PROMESSE study. The authors used a similar target, 54% fT>MIC in ELF, a value associated with microbiological response in a clinical study of Li et al. [50], and observed that an optimal PTA could only be attained for MIC breakpoints of 0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L with meropenem doses of 1 g/8 h and 2 g/8 h, respectively, administered by extended infusion (3 h). Similarly, Drusano et al. confirmed that even with the highest licensed meropenem dose, the 50% fT>MIC in ELF target could not be achieved even at very low MIC values (0.25 mg/L) [14]. Although the administration of meropenem by CI seems to improve drug exposure in ELF compared with extended infusion [48], it might not be sufficient to cover all intermediate Gram-negative pathogens causing nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients with conserved renal function. In those cases, alternative strategies may be required, especially when pathogens with high MIC values (> 2 mg/L) may be present. In fact, we estimate the meropenem dose by CI needed to achieve an optimal PTA for all considered intermediate strains (MIC between 2 and 8 mg/L) [23] that would have to be as high as 8 g/8 h, a dose that is four times higher than the highest approved meropenem dose, and that is related to a high probability of toxicity.",

The collection of ELF samples at different times would have allowed a more precise determination of the concentration-time profile in ELF. However, a recent study demonstrated that ELF models constructed with concentrations from sparse ELF sampling time points result in exposure estimates similar to those constructed from robustly sampled ELF profiles [51]. Thirdly, all samples were collected on the same day, so intraindividual variability during the treatment period could not be measured [52]. ELF samples were all collected in the infected lung; as distribution of inflammation is heterogeneous, the collection of samples in the clear lung could have led us to know the differences in the antibiotic diffusion. Finally, the relatively limited sample size and the use of combination therapy with nebulized CMS made difficult to correlate the PK/PD target in ELF with clinical and microbiological outcomes. Nevertheless, this study provides important and useful information about the meropenem dosages that should be used in clinical practice for treating nosocomial pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacteria in critically ill patients, considering both the achievement of clinical cure and possibly the prevention of the emergence of resistance.",
