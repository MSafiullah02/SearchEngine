In the same short period of time, some comprehensive advice has been given to health care providers, particularly anesthetists, about patient care during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. [1, 2] Neuraxial blocks may be considered preferred methods of anesthesia in the presence of respiratory disease risks. There are few valuable reports regarding the safety of neuraxial anesthesia in COVID-19 patients recently published. [3] Whilst spinal anesthesia has some advantages in COVID-19 patients, there are other considerations in the choice of anesthesia technique that require further research:",

[8, 9] The mechanism of this neuroinvasion is still not fully understood. Viral encephalitis, infectious toxic encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular events are three nervous system disorders related to coronavirus infections. Maybe neurological symptoms such as headache, consciousness disorder, paresthesia, and other pathological signs which are seen in COVID-19 [8] interfere with block evaluations following spinal anesthesia. 4 . Particular attention should be paid to airway exams before performing any regional anesthesia. If the COVID-19 patient is considered a case of difficult airway, it may be futuristic to have general anesthesia at the outset, so that if regional anesthesia suddenly fails, airway management will not be in an emergency situation, what would increase the risk of virus transmission to the operating room medical personnel. 5. COVID-19 patients are more anxious than other surgical patients entering the operating room. [10] The administration of an anxiolytic such as midazolam as a medication prior to anesthesia in these patients is not just a suggestion but a strong recommendation.",

Undoubtedly, keeping away from the patient's airway is important for the protection of health care providers, but the distance from the airway cannot be used as a basis for anesthesia management. Despite all mentioned doubts about the safety of spinal anesthesia in COVID-19 patients, this technique can still be one of the recommended methods to reduce the risk of infecting the operating room staff, if all the above considerations are taken into account. In other words, the relative and absolute contraindications for spinal anesthesia are precisely the same for COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 patients. Therefore, hemodynamically unstable patients, patients suffering from severe respiratory distress, or those presenting with coagulopathy, for example, are not suitable to undergo intrathecal anesthesia.",
