Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) has highlighted the need for better control of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Developing novel virus-specific vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can be time-consuming and costly. Convalescent plasma and safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAAs) are readily available treatment options. Here we developed a neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 virus and monkey Vero-E6 cells. We identified most potent sera from recovered patients for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We also screened 136 safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells and identified antiviral activity of nelfinavir, salinomycin, amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine and homoharringtonine. We found that combinations of virus-directed drug nelfinavir with host-directed drugs, such as salinomycin, amodiaquine, obatoclax, emetine and homoharringtonine exhibit synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Finally, we developed a website to disseminate the knowledge on available and emerging treatments of COVID-19.",

CoVs are composed of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, lipid envelope and several proteins including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are usually associated with mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections can lead to serious disease and death. In light of the current global pandemic, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) has highlighted the need for better control of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

            "text": "Human convalescent plasma is collected from recently recovered individuals, and is used to transfer passive antibody immunity to those who have recently been infected or have yet to be exposed to the virus. However, the reliability of diagnostic assays, as well as the quantity and neutralizing capacity of antibodies in the plasma should be considered. Both the WHO and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have recommended the evaluation of convalescent plasma for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease in controlled trials (WHO/HEO/R&D Blueprint (nCoV)/2020.1) (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2020) . Indeed, several trials have shown that convalescent plasma reduces viral load and is safe for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (Duan et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) . Interestingly, the studies also revealed variability in specific antibody production that was related to the degree of symptomatic disease. Typically, IgM and IgG antibodies develop between 6-15 days after disease onset, with the seroprevalence increasing to near 100% within 3 weeks. Some recovered patients did not have high titers of neutralizing antibodies. This may suggest that antibody levels decline with time and/or that only a subset of patients produces high-titer responses. It is also possible that non-neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses not connected to antibody production are contributing to protection and recovery, as described for other viral diseases (Gunn et al., 2018; Jenks et al., 2019; van Erp et al., 2019) .",

We have developed such a test and assessed the neutralization capacity of serum samples from patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections, patients with endemic coronavirus infections and healthy blood donors. Results from our test positively correlated with those from commercial ELISA assays. However, the correlation between the IgG and IgM ELISAs results was only r=0.28, p=0.11. The difference could be associated with time of sample collection, production of immunoglobulins, or sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use (for example, IgM is the first immunoglobulin to be produced in response to an antigen and can be detected during early onset of disease, whereas IgG is maintained in the body after initial exposure for long term response and can be detected after the infection has passed). Thus, combination of neutralization test and ELISA assays allowed us to identify the most potent sera from recovered patients for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",
