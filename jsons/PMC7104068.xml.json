Accordingly, attention to HD patient management is critical for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Second, it is our opinion that COVID-19 can be either prevented or controlled within an HD facility, and the key is to take effective measures early, including timely upgrading of personal protection measures and implementation of universal screening (Box 1\n), followed by quarantine and isolation as needed. We found that computed tomography of the chest was an appropriate screening test, given easy availability and high sensitivity. Third, we were surprised to find that although HD patients are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, most presented with either no symptoms or only mild clinical signs and symptoms. Although 7 HD patients died during the epidemic, including 6 with and 1 without COVID-19 infection, no patient died of severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Interestingly, the major cause of death was cardiovascular events, which seem to be related to insufficient dialysis due to patients missing HD sessions to avoid possible infection. In addition, we hypothesize that because of the chronic immune dysfunction seen in HD patients, SARS-Cov-2 infection did not trigger the inflammatory storm that appears to mediate clinical deterioration or death in many patients with COVID-19 infection.8\nBox 1Procedures for Screening for COVID-19 Infection in our HD Facility\nFirst Step: General Screening\n\u2022Patients covered: all HD patients and staff\u2022Examination method: CT of the chest\u2022Classification and actiona.Non\u2013COVID-19 patients (CT negative detection) to continue regular HDb.COVID-19 suspects (CT positive detection) to undergo further evaluation\n\n\nSecond Step: Infection Evaluation\n\u2022Patients covered: COVID-19 suspects\u2022Examination method: CBC + NT + ST (optional)\u2022Classification and actiona.Non\u2013COVID-19 patients (all negative) to undergo isolated HD with monitoringb.COVID-19 clinically diagnosed (hematology abnormal but no pathogen evidence) transferred to designated hospital to receive isolated dialysis and monitoringc.COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis (with pathogen evidence) transferred to designated hospital\n\nNote: Patients with relevant symptoms (fever, cough, etc) are not included because they will be transferred to fever clinics for comprehensive epidemic assessment.Abbreviations: CBC, complete blood cell count; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; HD, hemodialysis; NT, nucleic acid test; ST, serologic test.",
