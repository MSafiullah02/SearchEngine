            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family and is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. It infects approximately 3% of the worldwide population 1, 2. HCV can cause acute and chronic hepatitis, and lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 3. Although much progress has been made in developing highly effective HCV antivirals, an effective vaccine has yet to be developed 4, 5. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of HCV drives RNA translation to produce a polyprotein of approximately 3,000 amino acids (aa) that encodes both structural and nonstructural proteins 6-8. The development of HCV replicon systems advanced the understanding of HCV replication, viral protein processing and viral-host cell interactions 9, 10. An establishment of an infectious HCV cell culture system using a genotype 2a isolate (JFH1 strain) of HCV and Huh-7 cells was a major achievement 11-13. In this system, infectious HCV particles are secreted in an envelope glycoprotein-dependent manner and enable a variety of questions to be answered regarding HCV biology and cell infection. However, virus titers of JFH1 released from infected cells are relatively low and limit some applications of this system. Studies have identified adaptive or compensatory mutations that enhance infectious virus particle production from either wild-type JFH1 or intergenotypic chimeras 13-19.",

However, a higher titer of HCV reporter virus was produced after inserting EGFP and Rluc into NS5A C-terminus of an adaptively mutated JFH1 strain designated JFH1-AM120 18. In this study, we used the JFH1-AM120 as a vector to explore if infectious reporter virus would be produced following insertion of LacZ gene that was three time larger than Rluc, into the NS5A C-terminus. The result showed that the NS5A region of HCV JFH1-AM120 has the capacity to accommodate large foreign genes up to 3,039 bp and suggests that other relatively large gene inserts can be accommodated at this site.",

The results showed that HCV RNA amounts (Fig. 2B) correlated with changes in protein levels by western blotting.

These results demonstrated that the insertion of LacZ in NS5A C-terminal region of JFH1-AM120 significantly impaired the production of infectious viral particles.

Our results demonstrate that the LacZ reporter gene can be inserted into the NS5A C-terminus of HCV JFH1-AM120 and will express the predicted NS5A-LacZ fusion protein, which can be detected by western blotting three days after RNA transfection of cells. However, compared to the control vectors of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc, there was an obvious decrease in the expression of the NS5A fusion protein (Fig. 2A). \u03b2-galactosidase was also detected in these cells by several measures (Fig.3) and the supernatants of these cells produced infectious virus of JFH1-AM120-LacZ (Fig.4). However, the infectious virus titer was much lower, 0.98 x102 ffu/ml compared to 5.5x105 ffu/ml of parent JFH1-AM120 virus. In addition, the titer of infectious HCV JFH1-AM120-LacZ progressively decreased with serial passaging of cells, with the eventual loss of X-gal positive cells (Fig.5). This observation is consistent with Western blot and NS5A PCR analysis indicating the loss of the LacZ reporter gene (Fig.6). The reason for the loss of the inserted LacZ reporter gene is unclear. There may be three possible mechanisms on it. First, the HCV genome RNA might have the capability of repairing itself and removing exogenous genes. Second, the HCV NS5A gene has a limit to it's carrying capacity for exogenous genes, and LacZ is too large for stable expression. Third, the combined effects of viral RNA repair, expression stability and replication might result in LacZ depletion in some strains, which could become the dominant strains during subsequent replication process, and this is consistent with the basic principle of natural adaptive mutation selection.",

The production of infectious JFH1-AM120-LacZ virions reported here demonstrate that much larger gene inserts can be engineered into the C terminus of NS5A of JFH1-AM120 for other applications and approaches. However, the instability of this reporter virus and the loss of LacZ gene are likely to limit its use. Nevertheless, the fact that a reporter gene up to 3039bp in size can be inserted into the C terminus of NS5A indicates that additional studies can be performed to guide further engineering of JFH1-AM120 in the research of HCV.",
