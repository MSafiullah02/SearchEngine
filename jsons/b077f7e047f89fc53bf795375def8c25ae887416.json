We systematically searched Pubmed and Embase for studies reporting the incidence of respiratory viral infection in childhood CAP.The pooled incidences of viral infection were calculated with a random-effects model. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis and a univariant metaregression analysis. We included 21 eligible reports in our study. We found significant heterogeneity on the incidence of viral infection in childhood CAP. The random effects pooled incidence was 57.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 50.8-64.1). The pooled incidence of mixed infection was 29.3% (95%CI: 23.0-35.6) with considerable heterogeneity. The pooled incidence of mixed infection was 29.3% (95%CI: 23.0-35.6). Rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and bocavirus were found to be the three most common viruses in childhood CAP. We also demonstrated that respiratory viruses were detected in 76.1% of patients aged \u22641 year, 63.1% of patients aged 2-5 years and 27.9% of patients aged \u2265 6 years. We conclude that respiratory viruses are widely detected in paediatric patients with CAP by PCR or real-time PCR methods.

Mixed infections may induce more severe clinical diseases than individual bacterial or viral infections alone. One study reported that co-infection of influenza virus and Staphylococcus aureus can lead to severe fatal pneumonia in children. 40, 41 Our heterogeneity analysis generated two key findings. Firstly, the incidence of overall virus infection is reported to be higher in the studies that detect many virus species than the studies which detect fewer species.
