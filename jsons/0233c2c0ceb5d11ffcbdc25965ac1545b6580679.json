Early data describing patient cohorts in China suggest that individuals with cancer may have higher rates of COVID-19-related complications, including admission to intensive care units, need for mechanical ventilation and death. [3, 4] However, such studies are limited by small sample size, heterogeneous cancer types and several possible confounding variables including noncancer comorbidities. Oncology providers face difficult decisions, balancing plausible risks of COVID-19 infection for cancer patients with the recognized consequences of not treating cancer in an effective or timely manner. [5] Several medical societies have provided guidance for oncology providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] However, resources addressing the questions of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 crises remain scarce, and, in fact, at present, there is a dearth of reports of patients' perspectives on the issue. With this in mind, SHARE and the Foundation for Women's Cancer (FWC) hosted a webinar on April 10, 2020, entitled \"What the COVID-19 Crisis Means for Women with Gynecologic Cancer.\" SHARE is a nonprofit organization that enables informed survivors of ovarian and breast cancer to help women facing these diseases through its toll-free national helplines, in-person support groups, educational programs and advocacy with a focus on the medically underserved. The FWC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing research, education and awareness about gynecologic cancer risk, prevention, early detection and optimal treatment and is the official foundation of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO). SHARE and the FWC sent online webinar invitations to women with prior or current gynecologic through their email distribution lists and the registration link was posted on social media.",

The didactic portion was followed by a 30-minute question and answer session. Participants were invited to share questions through an online portal prior to and during the webinar.

Other topics of concern to participants included how best to \"protect myself,\" request for coping strategies and support programs, financial navigation and medical queries (port flush, taking ibuprofen) ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, there was concern expressed about the safety of a woman with a cancer history being a health care worker on the frontline. The participation from women with prior and current gynecologic cancer through this webinar offers gynecologic oncology care providers a glimpse into the questions and concerns of our patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely uniquely unsettling to gynecologic oncology patients; their treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, regular oncology evaluations rescheduled and the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer remains unclear. Furthermore, prior literature has established that women with ovarian cancer consider communication between patient and physicians essential [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Oncologists are facing unprecedented times. As providers of gynecologic oncology care, it is imperative that we remain",
