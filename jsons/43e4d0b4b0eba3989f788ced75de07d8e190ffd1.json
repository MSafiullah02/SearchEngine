First, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever (DTP3, HepB3, Hib3, PCV3, RotaC, MCV1, MCV2, MenA, RCV, YFV) to approximate the future deaths averted before completing five years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month Covid-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. Second, we analysed an alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the Covid-19 risk period. The excess number of infections due to additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure during immunisation visits assumes that contact reducing interventions flatten the outbreak curve during the Covid-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport and that upon child infection the whole household would be infected. Country specific household age structure estimates and age dependent infection fatality rates are then applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation alongside 95% uncertainty range estimates from probabilistic sensitivity analysis.",

In the high-impact scenario, we approximate the impact of sustained routine childhood immunisation with the estimates for impact of vaccination of a 6-month cohort in 2020. Hence, this scenario assumes that the suspension of immunisation will result in a cohort of unvaccinated children who have the same risk of disease as children in a completely unvaccinated population, and their vulnerability persists until they are 5 years old, i.e. no catch-up campaign will be conducted at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Because of herd protection and likely catch-up activities at the end of a potential disruption of immunisation services, this high-impact scenario very likely overestimates the negative impact of suspending immunisation services for a short period of time.",

We assume that in the absence of immunisation, herd immunity would protect children missing out on vaccination from all diseases with the exception of measles, and that vaccination through catch-up campaigns would close measles immunity gaps immediately following the 6 month Covid disruption period. This scenario is implemented as illustrated by the following example. In a country with 80% routine measles vaccine coverage, the inter-epidemic period of measles outbreaks is about 4 years [20] . The suspension of the routine vaccination programme for 6 months would correspond to an accumulation of susceptibles equivalent to 30 months in normal times, thus shrinking the inter-epidemic period to 2 years. In the absence of supplementary immunisation activities this would yield a 25% chance that an outbreak starts during the 6 months of suspension. Further, the physical distancing interventions in place to mitigate the Covid-19 risk may decrease that outbreak probability by an additional 50%. Thereby, there is a 12.5% (25% * 50%) chance of a measles outbreak during the 6-month suspension period.",

While pathogen resurgence will happen gradually due to herd protection from the rest of the population, this could be counterbalanced by unvaccinated children of this and other cohorts continuing to be at risk of disease beyond the 6-month window. In the presence of social distancing measures, the exposure to non-coronavirus pathogens will also likely be reduced but those who may remain susceptible as a result of immunisation service suspension may get infected once distancing measures are relaxed. In the low-impact scenario, we approximate the impact of sustaining vaccination by the number of child deaths as a result of potential measles outbreaks during the Covid-19 risk period while also accounting for catch-up campaigns to be delivered at the end of the Covid-19 risk period. We show that in both scenarios that continuation of routine childhood immunisation is beneficial and outweighs the excess risk of Covid-19 deaths due to the additional risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections during the immunisation visits.",

We assume a basic reproduction number ( R o ) of 2.5 [30]  and that the contact-reducing interventions enable the proportion of the population eventually infected to be approximately equal to the herd immunity threshold. Hence, we assume that in the absence of vaccination visits, \u0398 = 60% of the population will have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the epidemic. Hence, 40% ofhouseholds would not have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 independent of whether or not the infant in the household had attended routine childhood vaccination. Furthermore, if after 6 months 60% of the population was infected then, assuming a duration of infectiousness ( \u03a8 ) of one week [31] and a reasonably flat epidemic curve, then on any given day about p o = 2% of the population would be infected and potentially transmitting. In comparison to community members, we assume that vaccinators are at higher risk of being infected (between 1 and 4 times, p v = \u03b9 1 p o ) because of their higher frequency of exposure to other people, but at lower risk of onward transmission (between 0.25 and 1 times, t v = \u03b9 2 t o ) because most of their contacts with vaccinees are brief, and they have enhanced risk awareness and use corresponding protective measures including basic respiratory hygiene and personal protective equipment as available. Also, we assume that an infant child and the parent or adult carer each have between 1 and 10 ( n = U(1, 10) ) potentially infectious contacts during their travel to the vaccine clinic and in the waiting room. For each of the potentially infectious contacts by the child and parent with community members, there is a probability of transmission ( t o = R o / N\u03a8 ), which for example corresponds to ( t o = 6% ) probability of a transmission event occurring for ( R o = 2.5 ) secondary infections for someone with 6",
