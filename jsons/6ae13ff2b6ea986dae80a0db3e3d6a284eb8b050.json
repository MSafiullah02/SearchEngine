Although a quantitative methodology for their identification is still missing, the phenomenon of echo chambers is widely debated both at scientific and political level. To shed light on this issue, we introduce an operational definition of echo chambers and perform a massive comparative analysis on more than 1B pieces of contents produced by 1M users on four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab. We infer the leaning of users about controversial topics -ranging from vaccines to abortion -and reconstruct their interaction networks by analyzing different features, such as shared links domain, followed pages, follower relationship and commented posts. Our method quantifies the existence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the interaction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded peers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook and Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit and Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the hypothesis that platforms implementing news feed algorithms like Facebook may elicit the emergence of echo-chambers.",

The wide availability of content sparked the enthusiastic idea that users might be better informed and exposed to diversified point of views [3] [4] [5] . However, the human attention span remains limited [6, 7] and news feed algorithms might influence the selection process by promoting content similar to the ones already seen, thus reducing content diversity [8, 9] and eventually leading to polarization [10] [11] [12] [13] . On top of opinion polarization, users show the tendency to select information that adheres to their beliefs and join polarized groups formed around a shared narrative, called echo chambers [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Inside these closed communities formed by users having similar preferences and content consumption patterns, the information spreading is often biased [14, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Such a configuration might hamper the democratic deliberative process by altering the way facts are perceived [24] .",

Moreover, group polarization theory [32] has been proposed as a mechanism to model the dynamics leaning to the emergence of echo-chambers in online social networks [33] . It is remarkable that major social media and former U.S. Presidents alike have voiced such concerns [34] . Recently, however, the effects and the very existence of echo chambers have been questioned [3, [35] [36] [37] . This heated debate calls for a quantitative analysis able to gauge the presence of echo chambers across topics and social media. In this work, we provide a formal assessment of echo chambers by introducing an operational definition independent of the social media platform considered.",

We perform a comparative analysis on four major social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab.

Reddit is one of the most visited websites worldwide [38] and is organized as a forum to collect discussions about a wide amount of topics, ranging from politics to emotional support. Gab is relatively different, as it claims to be a social platform aimed at protecting free speech. Such a claim, together with the political leaning of its developers, made Gab the \"safe haven\" for the alt-right movement. However, low moderation and regulation on content has resulted in widespread hate speech. For these reasons, it has been repeatedly suspended by its service provider, and its mobile app was banned from both App and Play stores [39] . All these features make the comparison of the aforementioned social media particularly interesting for investigation. Overall, we take into account the interactions of more than 1M active users on the four platforms, for a total of more than 1B unique pieces of content, including posts and social interactions. Our findings suggest that platforms organized around social networks and with algorithms accounting for social feedback may increase polarization and favor the emergence of echo chambers.",

The theory posits that individuals strive towards internal consistency of thoughts and beliefs, by virtue of the fact that inconsistency, or dissonance, is psychologically uncomfortable. An individual will thus try to avoid information and situations that are likely to increase their dissonance, and seek instead consonant ones. Cognitive dissonance is thus possibly the primum movens, or innate root cause, of the ultimate formation of echo chambers. According to group polarization theory [32] , an echo chamber can act as a mechanism to reinforce an existing opinion within a group, and as a result move the entire group towards more extreme opinions. The lack of exposure to alternative opinions also creates a false perception of unanimity, and thus a different perception of reality across groups, which may hinder the democratic debate given the lack of a shared common ground on which to operate.",

Two key elements are needed for this scenario to take place. First, a group of individuals that share a common opinion in opposition to other individuals or groups characterized by different attitudes regarding the same topic. Second, social interactions that convey a flow of information between these individuals about the topic under consideration, that can thus influence their beliefs on the subject. Such interactions are more likely to be established between individuals characterized by similar opinions, that is, there is a certain degree of homophily in social interactions. Therefore, echo-chambers are characterized by the coexistence of two elements: (i) opinion polarization with respect to a controversial topic, and (ii) homophily in interactions, i.e. the preference to interact with like-minded peers.

Since we are interested in capturing the possible exchange of opinion between users, we assume directed links to represent the substrate over which information may flow. For instance, if user i follows user j on Twitter, user i can see tweets produced by user j, thus there is a flow of information from node j to node i in the network. That is, when the reconstructed network is directed, we assume the link direction points to possible influencers (opposite of information flow). Actions such as mentions or retweets may convey similar flows. In some cases, direct relations between users are not available in the data, so one needs to assume some proxy for social connections, e.g., a link between two users if they comment the same post on Facebook.

To each news organization is associated a political leaning score [49] ranging from extreme left to extreme right in accordance to the classification reported in Materials and Methods. We infer the individual leaning of a user i, x i \u2208 [\u22121, +1] by averaging the scores of the news organizations linked by user i according to Eq. (1).

Henceforth we focus on the data set about abortion, others are shown in the Supplementary Material (SM). Facebook. The individual leaning of users is quantified by considering endorsements in the form of likes to posts. While other actions such as comments or shares could be taken into account, the written text may radically change the inferred leaning. Additionally, while a like is usually a positive feedback on a news item, comments and share can be associated to different purposes [8] . A comment can have multiple features and meanings and can generate collective debate, while a share indicates a desire to spread a news item to friends. Posts are produced by pages that are labeled in a certain number of categories, and to each category we assign a numerical value (e.g., Anti-Vax (+1) or Pro-Vax (-1)). Each like to a post (only one like per post is allowed) represents an endorsement for that content, which is assumed to be aligned with the labeling of the page. Thus, the individual leaning of a user is defined as the average of the content leanings of the posts liked by the user, according to Eq. (1).",

            "text": "The topology of the interaction network can reveal the presence of echo-chambers, where users are surrounded by peers with similar leaning and thus are exposed with higher probability to similar contents. In network terms, this translates into a node i with a given leaning x i more likely to be connected with nodes with a leaning close to x i [21] . This concept can be quantified by defining, for each user i, the average leaning of their neighborhood, as Fig. 1 shows the correlation between the leaning of a user i and the leaning of their neighbors, x N i , for the four social media under consideration. The probability distributions P (x) (individual leaning) and P N (x) (average leaning of neighbors) are plotted on the x and y axis, respectively. All plots are color-coded contour maps, which represent the number of users in the phase space (x, x N ): the brighter the area in the map, the larger the density of users in that area. The topics of vaccines and abortion, on Facebook and Twitter, respectively, clearly show two distinct groups whose leanings differ quite starkly, as indicated by the two bright areas characterized by a high density of users with like-minded neighbors. Simi- Homophilic interactions can be revealed by the community structure of the interaction networks. We detect communities by applying the Louvain algorithm for community detection [50] . We remove singleton communities with only one user and look at the average leaning of each community, determined as the average of individual leanings of its members. Fig. 2 shows the communities emerging for each social medium, arranged by increasing average leaning on the x-axis (color-coded from blue to red), while the y-axis reports the size of the community. We find a picture that confirms the pattern observed before. On Facebook and Twitter, communities span the whole spectrum of possible leanings, but each community is formed by users with similar leaning. Some communities are characterized by very strong average leaning, especially in the case of Facebook. Conversely, communities on Reddit and Gab do not cover the whole spectrum, and all show similar average leaning. Furthermore, it is noticeable the almost total absence of communities with leaning very close to 0, confirming the polarized state of the systems. In addition, the number of communities identified is different among the four social media. The similar number of communities found in Gab and Reddit and the strong difference with respect to Facebook and Twitter suggests that both platforms structure and feedback algorithm may have an impact on the clustering process of users.",

Classical epidemic models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [52] have been used to study the diffusion of information, such as rumors or news [53, 54] . In the SIR model, each agent can be in either of three states: susceptible (unaware of the circulating information), infectious (aware and willing to spread it further), or recovered (aware but not willing to transmit it anymore). Susceptible (unaware) users may become infectious (aware) upon contact with infected neighbors, with certain transmission probability \u03b2. Infectious users can spontaneously become recovered with probability \u03bd. In order to measure the effects of the leaning of users on the diffusion of information, we run the SIR dynamics on the interaction networks, by starting the epidemic process with only one node i infected, and stopping it when no more infectious nodes are left.",

For this reason, here we compare Facebook and Reddit on a common topic, news consumption. Facebook and Reddit are particularly apt to a cross-comparison since they share the definition of individual leaning (computed by using the classification provided by mediabiasfactcheck.org, see Methods for further details) and the rationale in creating connections among users that is based on an interaction network. Fig. 4 shows a direct comparison of news consumption on Facebook and Reddit along the metrics used in the previous Sections to quantify the presence of echo-chambers: i) the correlation between the leaning of a user x and the average leaning of neighbors x N (top row), ii) the average leaning of communities detected in the networks (middle row), and iii) the average leaning \u00b5(x) of the influence sets reached by users with leaning x, by running SIR dynamics (bottom row). One can see that all three measures confirm the picture obtained for other data sets: On Facebook, we observe a clear separation among users depending on their leaning, while on Reddit users' leanings are more homogeneous and show only one peak. In the latter social media, even users displaying a more extreme leaning (noticeable in the marginal histogram of Figure  4 panel b top row) tend to interact with the majority. Moreover, on Facebook the leaning of the seed user has an effect on who the final recipients of the information are, therefore indicating the presence of echo-chambers.

The wide availability of content combined with confirmation bias and news feed algorithms may foster the emergence of groups of users around a shared narrative. Furthermore, the similarity of interests may exacerbate polarization and reinforce existing users tendencies and attitudes. To shed light on this issue, in this paper, we introduced an operational definition aimed at identifying echo chambers. We performed a massive comparative analysis on more than 1B pieces of contents produced by 1M users on four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab. The proposed method quantifies the presence of echochambers along two main dimensions: (i) homophily in the interaction networks, and (ii) bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded peers. Our results show peculiar differences across social media: while Facebook and Twitter are dominated by echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit and Gab are not. Furthermore, we perform a direct comparison of news consumption on both Reddit and Facebook. We found support for the hypothesis that platforms organized around social network and with news feed algorithms which take into account users' preferences foster the emergence of echo-chambers.",

The website provides the political bias related to a wide range of media outlets. The labeling provided by MBFC, retrieved in June 2019, ranges from Extreme Left to Extreme Right for what concerns the political bias. Certain media outlets are instead classified as 'questionable' sources or 'conspiracypseudoscience' sources if they tend to publish misinformation or false contents. However, most of the news outlets without an explicit political label reported by MBFC actually have a political bias (e.g., breitbart) that is reported in their description, as shown in Figure 5 . These media outlets often have a political bias that is classified as extreme (either left or right). Considering the importance of including such media outlets in our analysis, we manually reported their classification from the description provided by MBFC, thus adding 468 outlets to the pool of 1722 news outlets that already have a clear political label. The total number of media outlets for which we have a political label is 2190 and the overall leaning is summarized in Figure 6 .",

Panel (a) shows the joint distribution of the leaning of users, x, against the average leaning of their neighborhood X N . We note that the community referred to as \"Science\", to which is associated a leaning of -1, is much smaller than the community called \"Conspiracy\" and for this reason it is not clearly visible in the density plot but only in the histograms at its margins. Panel (b) shows the size and average leaning of communities detected by the Louvain algorithm. Panels (c) and (d) show the results of the SIR dynamics: the average leaning \u00b5(x) of the influence sets reached by users with leaning x, for two different values of the infection probability, while the recovery rate is fixed \u03bd = 0.2. Size and color of each point is related to the average size of the influence sets. C.

We selected all the contents (post, reply, quote) from 11/2017 to 10/2018, that is C = 13 580 937 unique pieces of content created by N = 165 162 unique users. We consider all the post that have a link to an external source, for an amount of 3 302 621 posts (excluding youtube links). By extracting the domain from each link we obtain 75 436 unique domains. In this set, 1650 unique domains for a total of 1 454 502 URLs (44%) were labelled in the MBFC database. We were able to compute the political leaning of N c = 31 286 users. We also reconstructed the interaction network using co-commenting as a proxy. The largest connected component includes G = 20 701 nodes, about the 66% of the users with leaning, E = 8 273 412 edges.",
