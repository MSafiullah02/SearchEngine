Despite the large impact of these arboviruses on health systems, there are no approved vaccines or treatments to fight these infections. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to discover new antiviral drugs. Natural products are a rich source of compounds with distinct biological activities, including antiviral properties. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential antiviral activity of Ginkgolic acid against the arboviruses CHIKV, MAYV, UNAV, and ZIKV. Viral progeny production in supernatants from cells treated or not treated with Ginkgolic acid was quantified by plaque-forming assay. Ginkgolic acid's direct virucidal activity against these arboviruses was also determined. Additionally, viral protein expression was assessed using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Our results reveal that Ginkgolic acid promotes a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers in all tested viruses. Moreover, the compound demonstrated strong virucidal activity. Finally, we found that viral protein expression was affected by treatment with this drug. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ginkgolic acid could have broader antiviral activity.",

With this in mind, we performed a time addition experiment to evaluate the impact of Ginkgolic acid on arbovirus life cycles. Our findings suggest that this compound affects the immediate early or early phase of virus replication. In connection with this, we decided to study alternative mechanisms by which Ginkgolic acid could prevent Alphavirus replication. Thus, we assessed the expression of viral proteins E1 and nsP1 using Western blot. These analyses suggest that Ginkgolic acid suppresses the expression of both viral proteins. Other studies have shown that natural compounds, such as Harringtonine can inhibit CHIKV replication through the suppression of viral protein expression.",

Some studies have revealed that Ginkgolic acid demonstrates cytotoxic activity at high concentrations in different cell lines [41, 42] . Similar findings on cytotoxicity have been reported using animals [43] . However, one pharmacokinetic study showed that Ginkgolic acid can be detected at micromolar levels in rat plasma following oral administration of a small dose (10 mg/kg), suggesting that non-cytotoxic doses of this compound could be used in animal models to evaluate its possible antiviral activity [44] . With respect to this, further detailed studies are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this compound as an antiviral drug in an animal infection model. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time that Ginkgolic acid's broader antiviral activity against different arthropod-borne viruses has been demonstrated.",
