Plants belonging to this family are dispersed worldwide and considered as some of the least difficult plants to cultivate. Coupled with easiness of cultivation, their aromatic, spicy properties make them an important part of pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries [13]. Plants discussed in this paper are herbaceous, so the parts most frequently used are leaves and herba, upper parts of the segment of the plant, mostly collected in full blossom. They can be used as fresh or dried material (as it is the case in culinary and food industries), but also in dosage forms specially prepared for external and internal use. Traditional forms of application for medicinal purposes include infusum (commonly called tea- form obtained by pouring nearly boiling water over the plant material), syrup, tincture, gargle (mouthwash), drops and many others. Besides drinking and using as mouthwash, these forms can be applied by rubbing and inhaling as well [[14], [15], [16]]. Some of the mainly used Lamiaceae plants are presented in Table 2\n. Beside their traditional use, many of them are also accepted in conventional medicine. For this reason, the World Health Organization suggests that plants such as some Lamiaceae family representatives, with a long history of use and confirmed therapeutic effects should be further evaluated for new activities and properties that could be useful in treatment and prevention of different diseases [17].",

Two other frequent types of extracts are EE and EO. The first type, EE can also be prepared at home (e.g. by macerating fresh or dried plants with diluted ethanol); and while ethanol can enhance the extraction of active compounds, higher concentrations of ethanol can show interactions with antiretroviral and other drugs. On the other hand, EOs are available as commercial products, and can be bought at different stores. Of course, only adequate application of EOs in patients (e.g. diluted in a lipid carrier) will prevent possible direct toxicity and allergic reactions [96]. Other types of extracts, obtained by using different solvents (e.g. chloroform, hexane\u2026) have not been used for assessment of anti(retro)viral properties, probably due to their toxicity.",

The latter paper also provided proof that AE can be absorbed from the intestine into blood, further giving potential for in vivo activity [55].

A chemical analysis of hyssop AE indicated a high concentration of caffeic acid (Fig. 1) whose anti-HIV activity was later confirmed [61] and further investigation led to discovery of substituted polysaccharide, named MAR-10, another substance from hyssop with notable in vitro anti-HIV activity [97]. This is not the only polysaccharide with detected anti-HIV properties. Investigating inflorescence of self-heal, researchers were able to isolate sulfated polysaccharide named prunellin, with excellent activity against HIV, without detected cytotoxicity [54,98]. Furthermore, various active compounds were isolated from different representatives of genus Salvia and tested for antiviral properties. Semi-synthesized caffeoyl-coumarin derivatives of sagecoumarin (isolated from S. officinalis) were proven to be extremely potent IIs, exhibiting activity in concentrations of 1\u20132 \u03bcmol l\u22121. Unfortunately, they exhibited poor activity against viral replication [99]. Lithospermic acid (Fig. 1) and lithospermic acid B (polycyclic phenolic carboxylic acids) were isolated from S. miltiorrhiza (Danshen, red sage) root extract and were shown to be potent and selective IIs [100]. Molecular docking calculations predicted that these compounds would be effective even in the case of HIV strains resistant to conventional therapy [101]. Using root of S. yunnanensis (another biological source of Danshen), researchers isolated polyphenol salvianolic acid N, which exhibited notable anti-HIV-1 activity and RT and integrase inhibition in vitro [102]. Five more tested compounds: salvianolic acid A, methyl salvianolate A, ethyl salvianolate A, lithospermic acid and cis-lithospermic acid showed activity against HIV-1 replication in concentrations 2.04\u20136.11 \u03bcg ml\u22121. They were also good IIs, but weak inhibitors of RT and protease [103].",

It was later demonstrated that another extracted polysaccharide acts against HSV antigen expression [105]. A third isolated polysaccharide, from the same plant, self-heal, also expressed anti-HSV activity, and its effectiveness was confirmed in skin and genital lesions in guinea pigs and mice, respectively [106]. Other types of compounds, diterpenes safficinolide and sageone, isolated from the common sage (S. officinalis) also exhibited anti-HSV-1 effects [107]. From the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (phenolic acid) and several glycosides of acacetin only weak activity against HSV-1 has been recorded [108]. Protocatehuic aldehide isolated from species S. miltiorrhiza expressed activity against duck HBV both in vitro (cell cultures) and in vivo (ducklings) [109].",

Due to the fact that studies of antiviral activity are performed in living systems (usually cell cultures), a minimum concentration that displays (cyto)toxicity should also be reported [114]. Selectivity index (SI) represents the ratio of determined cytotoxic concentration and effective concentration. SI is a valuable indicator of effectiveness of the tested substance, and, if the compound or mixture exhibits activity in low concentrations, it is not considered useful and applicable if its SI is also low. Only values of SI higher than 4 are considered appropriate [114,115]. For example, carnosic acid was toxic for tested cells, even though it displayed potent activity against HIV integrase in vitro [116]. Compounds salvianolic acids D and E, isolated from different Salvia species, were proven to be extremely effective in vitro against HIV-1 integrase. However, they were not further evaluated for antiviral effects due to their toxicity [117]. Some plants\u2019 extracts e.g. EE of Salvia triloba [50], EE of Satureja boliviana [81], ME of Ocimum sanctum [89], commercially available rosemary extract and a mixture of Proven\u00e7al Herbs (containing rosemary, sage, thyme and oregano) [51] were proven as toxic, so estimation of their anti(retro)viral activity was not possible.",

This was achieved through the time-of-addition (T-o-A) study, which is comprised of assays with different procedures of addition of IS, viral suspension and cell cultures [48,[54], [55], [56],[62], [63], [64],66,68,69,71,73,74,77,82,87,88,91,92,94,104,106,112]. Based on the highest activity in a certain assay, a conclusion about the exact type of M-o-A can be derived (Fig. 2\n). Generally, four assays for investigating antiviral effects of different mixtures and substances are in use:1.Pretreatment of the cell culture- IS is incubated with a cell culture, and after a certain time period, a viral suspension is added. In this case, the results show whether the IS was able to penetrate inside the cells and manifest its activity.2.Pretreatment of the virus- A viral suspension is incubated together with the IS. After the incubation, the suspension is rinsed of substance and inoculated into the cell culture. Activity in this assay indicates direct activity towards the virus and its structures, e.g. the envelope.3.Adsorption- The viral suspension and IS are added simultaneously into cell cultures. This assay indicates activity towards structures responsible for viral attachment and/or penetration of virus into the cells.4.Intracellular replication- IS is added during viral replication inside the cells. Substances showing activity in this assay are able to affect later stages of the viral life cycle [71].\n",

The effect of different main compounds in EO can be illustrated in the example of lemon balm. First EO with \u03b2-cubebene and \u03b2-caryophyllene as major compounds exhibited effects in cases of cell pretreatment with IS [70], while EO containing mainly geranial, \u03b2-caryophyllene and neral achieved effects when HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses were pretreated and effects were absent in other T-o-A studies [71].

Use of the most abundant compounds in products (some suggested in the previous text) is an even more precise approach to investigation. Application of plants should, however, be carefully monitored. Although the plants generally have many potential beneficial effects, they also have potential to cause interactions with antiretroviral and other drugs, resulting in a drastic increase or decrease of drug concentrations in patients, leading to toxicity or therapeutic failure. However, in cases of HIV, it is believed that prolonged exposure to drugs (not exceeding therapeutic concentrations) can be positive for patients, as it prevents selection of resistant strains and possibly decreases doses of conventional drugs, together with their side effects [121].
