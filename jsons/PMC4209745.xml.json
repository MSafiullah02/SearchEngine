            "text": "Highly homologous in their extracellular sequences, members of the Fc receptor family have both structural differences as well as allelic variations which impact biological properties and their respective roles in pathophysiology. Investigation over the last two decades has demonstrated regulatory and/or coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that change receptor biology through one of three mechanisms: quantitative receptor expression, ligand affinity, or signaling capacity. Emerging data have also demonstrated copy number variation (CNV) in the classical low affinity Fc receptors for IgG. Many of the SNPs and CNVs are associated with pathogenesis, severity, and/or treatment outcome in a range of immune-mediated diseases. Signaling and biology of Fc receptors are discussed in Chapter X and Y. In this chapter, we discuss the germ line variations in the genes encoding Fc receptors and how these variations impact receptor function and association with disease.\n",

            "text": "A nonsynonymous polymorphism (519G > A, rs1801274) in exon 4 encoding the membrane proximal Ig-like domain of FCGR2A leads to an arginine (R) to histidine (H) change at position 131 and alters receptor affinity for ligand. The R131 and H131 alleles are co-dominantly expressed. The Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131 allele readily binds human IgG2 while the R131 allele does not effectively bind IgG2 (Salmon et al. 1992; Parren et al. 1992). Studies with IgG3 suggest that the H131 allele may bind IgG3 with moderately greater affinity than the R131 allele (Parren et al. 1992; Bredius et al. 1994). Crystallographic analysis and molecular modeling studies suggest that the H131R position is on the contact interface between receptor-IgG (Maxwell et al. 1999). As the most broadly expressed Fc\u03b3R across a range of cell types in humans, the variation in ligand affinity has functional relevance in determining cellular interactions with IgG antibodies, including the clearance of IgG2 immune complexes. For example, neutrophils from Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131 homozygous donors are much more effective than neutrophils from R131 homozygous donors in phagocytosing IgG2-opsonized particles (Bredius et al. 1993).",

These disease association studies, based on high through put genotyping technologies, suggest that variation in Fc\u03b3RIIa biology may contribute to a number of human disease phenotypes. However, not all variants identified through such studies have an obvious function or relationship to biological processes, and direct inference of pathophysiology requires further study. In some cases, SNP-based associations may be tagging linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. Given the segmental duplication in the classical low affinity FCGR cluster and the consequent high degree of genomic sequence homology, this region is not technically amenable to efficient genotyping with array-based strategies. Thus, genotyping coverage in genome-wide association studies is not optimal because of difficulty in accurate probe design and position assignment.\n",

Functionally, NK cells bearing the ORF allele are capable of clearing anti-Fc\u03b3RII coated particles through reverse antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Ernst et al. 2002; Breunis et al. 2008). On B cells, the Fc\u03b3RIIc-ORF allele counterbalances the negative feedback of Fc\u03b3RIIb on BCR signaling, resulting in enhanced B cell responsiveness including upstream signaling events such as tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and calcium transients, and integrated cell programs such as antibody production (Li et al. 2013).",

Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA1 exhibits higher affinity and more efficient phagocytosis of IgG1 and IgG3 opsonized particles compared to the NA2 allele (Salmon et al. 1990). The SH allele results from an alanine to aspartic acid substitution at position 78 and is observed in the context of the NA2 allele (Bux et al. 1997).

A common SNP (844A > G) was identified through direct sequencing of the coding region of FCAR (CD89) (Jasek et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2007). This transition changes amino acid codon 248 in the cytoplasmic domain from serine to glycine, resulting in enhanced cellular functions. For example, when equivalently stimulated with human IgA, neutrophils homozygous for the Fc\u03b1R-G248 allele produce significantly higher levels of IL-6 compared to neutrophils from homozygous Fc\u03b1R-S248 individuals. In the absence of FcR \u03b3-chain pairing, Fc\u03b1R-S248 allele fails to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, Fc\u03b1R-G248 maintains signaling capacity even without the FcR\u03b3, producing both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. The increased activity of the G248 form may reflect, at least in part, its enhanced association with the Src family kinase, Lyn (Wu et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Often working in synergy with the complement system, Fc\u03b3R-mediated clearance of antibody-coated microbes and Fc\u03b3R-triggered inflammatory cytokine release are important mechanisms in eliminating infectious agents. Since human IgG2 is relatively inefficient in initiating the complement cascade, the Fc\u03b3RIIa-131H allele is the primary leukocyte receptor capable of effectively clearing IgG2-coated microbes, which is important in host defense against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Hemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis (Bredius et al. 1993; Jefferis and Kumararatne 1990; Endeman et al. 2009; Platonov et al. 1998; Jansen et al. 1999). In the context of Strep\npneumonia pneumonia, the Fc\u03b3RIIa-131R allele, which fails to bind IgG2, may be over-represented in bacteremic patients, and in one study, the most severely infected bacteremic patients, who died within 1 week of hospitalization, were all homozygous for the R131 allele (Yee et al. 2000). Similarly, the Fc\u03b3RIIa-131R allele is associated with increased infection by Hemophilus influenza and Neisseria meningitidis in multiple bacterial respiratory diseases and sepsis (Endeman et al. 2009; Platonov et al. 1998; Sanders et al. 1994; Bredius et al. 1994; Yuan et al. 2005). Of note, Fc\u03b3RIIa also binds C-reactive protein with allele sensitivity reciprocal to IgG2 (Stein et al. 2000). High levels of CRP during infection may contribute to the clearance of IgG2-coated microbes by the R131 allele by opsonizing encapsulated bacteria and subsequently activating the complement mediated clearance (Weiser et al. 1998), which may compensate, at least in part, for the lack of Fc\u03b3R-IgG2 mediated clearance in patients with the R131 allele.",

Functional studies largely focused on neutrophils have demonstrated that neutrophils homozygous for the Fc\u03b3RIIa-131H allele were more efficient in bacterial phagocytosis, degranulation and elastase release (Nicu et al. 2007). In the same study the homozygous Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131 patients also showed more bone loss than those with the H/R or R/R allotypes. Kobayashi et al. has also reported that neutrophils carrying the Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA2 allele showed lower reactivity to IgG1/IgG3 coated periodontopathic bacteria and induced weaker oxidative burst (Kobayashi et al. 2000).",

A recent meta-analysis aggregating 17 studies reported modest association of Fc\u03b3RIIa-131R with aggressive periodontitis in Asians, relatively strong association of the Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA1/NA2 polymorphism with both aggressive and chronic periodontitis, and a statistically insignificant relationship between the Fc\u03b3RIIIa-F158 V and periodontitis (Song and Lee 2013). In studies of the distribution of the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb variants, significant enrichment of the Fc\u03b3RIIb-232T allele in patients with aggressive periodontitis compared to both chronic periodontitis patient and healthy control groups occurs in Japanese periodontitis patients (Yasuda et al. 2003). Furthermore, the composite genotype of Fc\u03b3RIIb-232T plus Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA2 was strongly associated with aggressive periodontitis. The large number of B cells (Yuan et al. 1999) and the elevated antibody level (Horino et al. 1989) in periodontal lesions, as well as our understanding of the biology of the Fc\u03b3RIIb-232T allele make the link between Fc\u03b3RIIb-232T and periodontitis biologically plausible.",

            "text": "The vasculitides are a group of disorders that involve inflammation of the blood vessels. Although the etiology of vasculitis is often not clear, vascular inflammation can be immunologically mediated, triggered by immune complexes, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies as well as by cell-mediated processes. The classification of the vasculitides is typically based on the size of the affected vessel. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, is a type of neutrophil mediated vasculitis affecting small and medium sized vessels. GPA is often characterized by the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (Nolle et al. 1989). Engagement of both ANCA target and Fc receptors on myeloid cells by ANCA elicits production of interleukin-8, a neutrophil chemotactic factor, and a series of effector programs such as oxidative burst, degranulation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Ralston et al. 1997; Porges et al. 1994; Kessenbrock et al. 2009; Sangaletti et al. 2012). No clear association between GPA susceptibility and the Fc\u03b3RIIa allotype has been demonstrated although some evidence suggests a relationship to the likelihood of relapsing disease (Edberg et al. 1997; Tse et al. 1999, 2000). Fc\u03b3RIIIb, the numerically predominant Fc\u03b3R on neutrophils, is the major receptor interacting with anti-PR3 IgG ANCA (Kocher et al. 1998), and FCGR3B CNV has been associated with GPA (Fanciulli et al. 2007). The Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA1 allele, known to induce stronger neutrophil activation than the NA2 allele (Salmon et al. 1990), has similar allele frequencies in GPA and healthy populations, suggesting no role in overall disease risk. However, the presence of the NA1 allele is associated with the development of severe renal damage in GPA patients (Neira et al. 1996; Kelley et al. 2011).",

Genome wide association studies have identified an association between Kawasaki disease and the FCGR2A locus with the 131H variant conferring elevated disease risk (Shrestha et al. 2012; Onouchi et al. 2012). It is reasonable to speculate the Fc\u03b3RIIa-131H bearing leukocytes are more pro-inflammatory in the setting of Kawasaki disease, although direct experimental evidence waits to be established. One might also anticipate an association between IgG receptor variants and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the only proven therapy for Kawasaki disease. Indeed, in Japanese patients, those with the Fc\u03b3RIIa-131H allele responded more efficiently to IVIG administration. Patients with the 131R allele were more likely to develop coronary lesions even after treatment (Taniuchi et al. 2005). Consistent with the notion that tilting the immune system towards inflammation might be associated with disease expression, the FCGR2C-ORF SNP was recently reported to be enriched in Kawasaki disease patients (Breunis et al. 2013).",

Homozygosity for the transmembrane 187T variant of Fc\u03b3RIIb is also associated with SLE susceptibility in Japanese (Kyogoku et al. 2002), Chinese (Chu et al. 2004) and Thais (Siriboonrit et al. 2003). Interestingly, the 187T allele has a lower frequency in European Americans and is not associated with SLE in either this ancestry group or in African Americans where the frequency of 187T is similar to that of Asians (Li et al. 2003; Magnusson et al. 2004). Whether this difference represents, less statistical power for detection of association in these groups or an epistatic effect is not certain. The Fc\u03b3RIIb-187T allele may be a risk factor for anti-GBM disease in Chinese (Zhou et al. 2010) while a promoter haplotype, 2B.4 (\u2212386C \u2212120A), which alters FCGR2B gene expression is associated with SLE (Su et al. 2004). In a second patient population, homozygosity of the \u2212386C allele alone (also referred to as \u2212343C) affirmed an association of promoter variants with SLE (Blank et al. 2005). CNV in this receptor cluster, including the FCGR2C-ORF allele, may be associated with SLE in patients of European and African ancestry (Li et al. 2013).",

Associated with SLE, RA, and AITD in Japanese (Kochi et al. 2005; Gibson et al. 2009), this variant is not associated with these conditions in other ethnicities suggesting that it is not a general autoimmunity risk factor (Chistiakov and Chistiakov 2007).

Results of meta-analyses differ on whether the \u2212169C > T is associated with SLE in different ethnicities (Breunis et al. 2013; Mao et al. 2010; Song et al. 2013), and the mechanism(s) through which this variant may contribute to SLE remains unclear.",

            "text": "Allergic diseases are a type of hypersensitivity characterized by mast cell activation and IgE-mediated inflammation. The high-affinity IgE receptor expressed on mast cells, Fc\u03b5RI, has long been considered a candidate gene in allergic diseases. Multiple studies have established a consistent genetic association between allergies and the promoter variants of Fc\u03b5RI \u03b1-chain. The \u221266T > C and/or the \u2212315C > T SNPs are associated with atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, asthma, and high serum IgE levels (Hasegawa et al. 2003; Potaczek et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2006; Bae et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2012; Niwa et al. 2010). The \u221266T > C SNP was highlighted as the strongest hit in two GWA studies with high IgE levels (Weidinger et al. 2008; Granada et al. 2012). These genetic findings may be explained by functional studies that have demonstrated that both SNPs amplify transcription activity, increasing Fc\u03b5RI expression on mast cells and basophils (Hasegawa et al. 2003; Kanada et al. 2008), and the well-established observation that surface Fc\u03b5RI expression correlates positively with circulating IgE levels (MacGlashan 2005). Similarly, several SNPs in the Fc\u03b5RI \u03b2-chain are associated with allergic inflammatory diseases such as atopy, asthma, and nasal allergy (Nishiyama et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2004; Laprise et al. 2000; Nagata et al. 2001; Li and Hopkin 1997; Hizawa et al. 2000; Kim et al. 2006, 2007; Yang et al. 2014).

The R62W alteration in the FCER2 gene, that yields increased IgE binding and augmented ERK signaling (Chan et al. 2014), is associated with elevated serum IgE levels and an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation in children (Laitinen et al. 2000; Koster et al. 2011; Tantisira et al. 2007). A promoter SNP in the FCER2 gene, rs3760687, associated with increased total serum IgE (Sharma et al. 2014), may alter the activity of the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, leading to modulation of Fc\u03b5RII expression (Potaczek et al. 2009).",

In a candidate gene study, both the Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131H and the Fc\u03b3RIIb-I187T SNPs have been associated with atopy (Wu et al 2014). In this context, it is conceivable that Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131 allele may clear allergen-IgG2 immune complexes more efficiently, preventing inflammation and tissue damage. Whether allergen-specific IgG2 levels vary in accordance with Fc\u03b3RIIa polymorphisms is unknown. Furthermore, the Fc\u03b3RIIb-187T allele may not be as effective in negatively regulating BCR function, resulting in increased B cell IgE production. Crosstalk between Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells is also a possibility.",

The precedent that alleles which alter binding and function of Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIa may affect the efficacy of antibody therapy is an important principle in antibody-based therapeutics.

Fc receptor polymorphisms modulate the effectiveness of immune system in defense against invading pathogens by regulating immune cell activities. They also impact the handling of immune reactants and the threshold of immune tolerance. Complex clinical phenotypes, such as autoimmunity or allergy, involve multiple genetic and environmental factors, and the subtle regulatory effects of various naturally occurring polymorphisms are compounded in their impact over time. Accurate assessment of the contributions of Fc receptor polymorphisms to immune system function and clinical phenotype requires a careful understanding of the genomic structure, sequence homology, and known physiological responses of Fc receptors in addition to well phenotyped study populations for adequately powered association studies. Such studies have provided important insights into pathogenetic mechanisms and potential novel therapeutic approaches.",
