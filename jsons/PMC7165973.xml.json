To this end, we used subgenomic HAV and HCV firefly luciferase reporter replicons (Fig. 1A) and measured their replication efficiency by quantifying luciferase reporter activity upon electroporation into various human liver\u2010derived cell lines. HCV gt2a (JFH) replicated with high efficiency in the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, and its subclones, Huh7\u2010Lunet and Huh7.5, whereas HCV gt1 (Con1, H77) RNA replication was highest in Huh7\u2010Lunet cells and far less efficient in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells, as reported before15 (Fig. 1B). HAV replicated with similar efficiency in all three cell lines and luciferase activity levels were comparable to gt1 in Huh7\u2010Lunet, suggesting that this cell clone was well suited for comparative analyses of HCV\u2010 and HAV\u2010RNA replication. The human hepatoma cell line, Huh6, only supported RNA replication of HAV and HCV gt2a (JFH), though to a much lesser extent than Huh7\u2010derived cell lines (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). No transient replication of HAV or HCV replicons could be observed in HepG2, HepaRG, or FrHK4 (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a colony\u2010formation assay (CFA) using selectable replicons, which is also well established as a quantitative measure of HCV replication.20 However, albeit replicating with similar efficiency in the transient model, HCV Con1 was 100\u2010fold more efficient in establishing single\u2010cell clones (Fig. 1C). This hinted to a higher capability of the HCV replicase to establish persistent replication, as observed in vivo, but precluded the CFA for comparative analysis of HCV and HAV replication efficiency.",

Although comparison of several published genome sequences revealed that the HAV genome does not contain any conserved miR122\u2010binding sites, we tested whether HAV indirectly depended on miR122. Therefore, we first used the human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B, lacking miR122 and measured HAV and HCV RNA upon coelectroporation of the different replicons with or without miR122 or a defective miR122 mutant (miR122_A4U; Fig. 1D). HAV replication was robust in Hep3B cells, whereas HCV\u2010RNA replication was strongly dependent on miR122 coelectroporation (Fig. 1D), indicating that HAV\u2010RNA replication does not require miR122. Because HCV gt1 replication was very low in Hep3B, even in the presence of miR122, we confirmed these results by using a miR122 antagonist (mirVana) in Huh7\u2010Lunet. Again, all HCV isolates were highly dependent on this miRNA, whereas HAV was not affected by miR122 sequestration (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). In summary, HAV and HCV are able to replicate in an identical set of human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7, Huh6, and Hep3B). However, in contrast to HCV, HAV\u2010RNA replication was independent of miR122. Because RNA replication of HAV and all HCV isolates proved to be robust and comparable in Huh7\u2010Lunet cells, we used this cell line for further comparative studies of the two viruses.",

            "text": "HCV\u2010RNA replication strictly depends on PI4KIII\u03b1,9 whereas for several members of the Picornaviridae family, as well as for HCV gt1a and 1b, a requirement for PI4KIII\u03b2 has been reported.8, 11 To clarify, whether one of the two PI4KIII isoforms might be involved in HAV\u2010RNA replication, we utilized the small\u2010molecule inhibitors, AL\u20109 or PIK93, specifically targeting PI4KIII\u03b1 or PI4KIII\u03b2, respectively.10, 11 As expected, AL\u20109 strongly inhibited replication of all HCV isolates in absence of cytostatic effects (Fig. 3A and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). However, HAV remained unaffected by AL\u20109, arguing against a role of PI4KIII\u03b1 for HAV\u2010RNA replication (Fig. 3A). This notion was confirmed in Huh7\u2010Lunet cells stably expressing a shRNA targeting PI4KIII\u03b1 expression (shPI4KIII\u03b1; Fig. 3B). To assess whether HAV\u2010RNA replication depended on PI4KIII\u03b2, we measured sensitivity of HAV\u2010 and HCV\u2010RNA replication to the PI4KIII\u03b2 inhibitor, PIK93. Interestingly, PIK93 treatment resulted in a dose\u2010dependent and strong inhibition of HCV gt1b (Con1) replication, whereas HCV gt1a and gt2a as well as HAV\u2010RNA replication remained almost unaffected (Fig. 3C). Only the highest concentration of PIK93 (10 \u00b5M) caused a slight reduction in HAV and JFH replication, possibly owing to mild cytostatic effects of the drug at this concentration (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). Additionally, to thoroughly assess a potential involvement of PI4KIII\u03b2 in HAV replication, we applied the CRISPR\u2010CAS9 technique based on a guideRNA targeting PI4KIII\u03b2 to establish PI4KIII\u03b2\u2010knockout cells (Fig. 3D). One cell clone (Clone C1) had a complete knockout of PI4KIII\u03b2 and was therefore chosen for further studies, as well as a cell pool characterized by reduced PI4KIII\u03b2 levels (Pool3) to control for clonal effects (Fig. 3D). HCV gt2a and HAV replication differed only slightly between parental cells, Clone C1 and Pool3 (Fig. 3E), confirming the independence of HAV and JFH replication from PI4KIII\u03b2. HCV gt1b replication was tremendously impaired in cell lines with a reduced expression of PI4KIII\u03b2, in contrast to HCV gt2a and in line with data gained from PIK93 treatment (Fig. 3E). HCV gt1a RNA replication was drastically reduced in Clone C1 and in Pool3 as well, hinting at a role of PI4KIII\u03b2 for gt1 in general (Fig. 3E). In conclusion, HCV gt2a RNA replication strongly depended on PI4KIII\u03b1, whereas HCV gt1b and, most likely, gt1a RNA replication relied on both kinases. In contrast to HCV and other picornaviruses, neither PI4KIII\u03b1 nor PI4KIII\u03b2 are required for HAV\u2010RNA replication.",

Hence, we probed whether HAV also depended on members of the immunophilin family and therefore analyzed inhibition of viral RNA replication by various immunophilin inhibitors. As shown before, CsA, a cyclic undecapeptide inhibiting a wide range of Cyps,12, 21 blocked RNA replication of all HCV isolates in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In addition CsA inhibited HAV replication, albeit with lower efficiency, indicating that different immunophilins might be involved in HCV and HAV replication, respectively (Fig. 4A). To analyze the dependency of HAV on CypA and other Cyps, we used NIM811, a nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog with similar structure,12, 22 and SFA, a structurally unrelated Cyp inhibitor,12 which is unlikely to have further common targets with CsA and NIM811 apart from Cyps. Furthermore, we applied specific knockdown of CypA, which is the Cyp most important for HCV. As expected, NIM811 inhibited HCV replication with even higher efficiency than CsA, whereas its effect on HAV replication was comparable to CsA\u2010induced inhibition (Fig. 4B; Table 1 and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). In contrast, SFA treatment inhibited all HCV isolates to a similar extent as CsA and NIM811, but resulted only in a marginal decrease of HAV replication. This suggested either that HAV utilized immunophilins, which were not efficiently inhibited by SFA, or that HAV replication might be independent from cyclophilins (Fig. 4C; Table 1 and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). Indeed, HCV replication was dramatically reduced for all HCV isolates in shCypA cells,16 whereas HAV replicated with equal efficiency in shCypA and shONT cells, arguing against a role of CypA for HAV\u2010RNA replication (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo). Given that CsA not only inhibits Cyps, but also ABC transporters,23 we implemented further inhibitors to narrow down potential targets involved in the CsA\u2010mediated inhibition of HAV replication.

Owing to the large number of human ABC transporters (49 encoded in the human genome), most of which are poorly characterized,24 and considering the lack of specific inhibitors, we did not undertake further efforts to identify distinct candidates. Instead, we focused on FK506\u2010binding proteins (FKBPs), another class of immunophilins with peptidyl\u2010prolyl cis trans isomerase activity, which can be inhibited by the immunosuppressant, FK506 (Tacrolimus).21 We observed a dose\u2010dependent and strong inhibition of HAV\u2010RNA replication by FK506 at noncytostatic concentrations, whereas HCV replication was not affected by this drug, suggesting that HAV\u2010RNA replication depends on FKBPs rather than Cyps (Fig. 4F).",

            "text": "Thus far, our data revealed no individual common host factor of HCV and HAV replication, but rather pointed to a related set of functions exploited by both viruses. To get a general overview on cellular resources occupied by HCV and HAV, we examined viral competition by cotransfecting firefly luciferase (LucHAV, LucJFH) and renilla luciferase (R\u2010LucJFH) reporter replicons into Huh7\u2010Lunet cells (Fig. 5A). In case of largely overlapping sets of host factors, we expected a strong interference between both replicons, whereas a lack of interference would indicate that both viruses replicate in different subcellular niches. Given that JFH1 replication was much more efficient and faster than HAV, we included a JFH1 replicon containing a chimeric 3\u2019 nontranslated region (NTR) that attenuates replication efficiency.18 Indeed, the presence of wild\u2010type (wt) JFH strongly suppressed HAV\u2010RNA replication, which remained unaffected, when combined with the replication\u2010deficient control, JFHdGDD (Fig. 5B). In contrast, R\u2010LucJFH RNA replication was not affected by coelectroporation of HAV RNA (Fig. 5C). However, the JFH chimera (R\u2010LucJFH X\u2010tail Con1/JFH X\u2010tail Con1), with reduced replication fitness, only marginally impaired HAV\u2010RNA replication (Fig. 5B), arguing against largely overlapping sets of limiting host factors between the two viruses. This result rather suggested limitations of global cellular resources in the presence of JFH wt, which reaches maximal replication levels already at 24 hours after transfection (Fig. 5C). In support of this view, JFH wt had a stronger relative impact on replication of R\u2010LucJFH X\u2010tail Con1 than on HAV, probably owing to the additional competition for limiting host factors and replication within the same subcellular compartment (Fig. 5B,D). To confirm that cells indeed were transfected with both replicons, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) analysis (Fig. 5E). Almost all cells were positive for HCV nonstructural (NS) protein 5A (NS5A), whereas only a few cells stained positive for HAV, most likely owing to lower replication levels of HAV and the limited sensitivity of the anti\u20103C antibody. However, several cells were clearly double positive for HAV and HCV, confirming that both replicons were able to replicate within the same cell and corroborating the notion of only limited competition between viral replicases (Fig. 5E). In support of this assumption, HCV NS5A and HAV 3C also did not colocalize substantially in double\u2010positive cells, which was further confirmed in an expression model using HCV NS3\u20105B and HAV 2A\u20103D (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo,C), also showing that HAV 3C primarily colocalized with mitochondria (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27847/suppinfo,C).",

However, in a CFA, reflecting the ability to establish persistent replication, HCV replicons were substantially more efficient. Although we cannot rule out an impact of the differing replicon design, this result indicates that the replicases of both viruses might have a different capability to maintain long\u2010term replication in the same cells or that persistent HAV replication exerts cytopathic effects. It will be the subject of future studies to see how these phenotypes in cell culture contribute to the differing natural history of infection in vivo. Furthermore, availability of a homogenous cell\u2010culture system for both viruses will enable studies of activation and blockade of innate immune responses by mitochondrial antiviral\u2010signaling protein (MAVS) and TIR\u2010domain\u2013containing adapter\u2010inducing IFN\u2010\u03b2 (TRIF) cleavage, which is achieved by proteases of HAV and HCV.26 Despite being capable of blocking innate immune responses, HCV induces high ISG levels in acute and chronic infection, preferentially in infected cells,27, 28 whereas almost no ISGs are induced in livers of HAV\u2010infected chimpanzees,2 suggesting that HAV either has a lower capability of stimulating innate immunity or is more efficient in cleaving the critical adaptor proteins. However, induction of ISGs seems to be a factor promoting persistence, given that we found very similar sensitivity of both replicases to type I, II, and III IFNs, in line with studies on HCV and HAV infection in vitro.29, 30 This seems somehow counterintuitive, but reducing antigen loads by a well\u2010dosed induction of ISGs in the case of HCV might dampen efficiency of recognition by the adaptive immune system, thereby preventing eradication of infected cells.",

From the inhibition profiles, we deduced that most Cyps are not involved in HAV\u2010RNA replication. Still, we cannot exclude Cyps being utilized, which are not blocked or inhibited, to a lesser extent, by the inhibitors. However, it seems more likely that the block of HAV replication by CsA and structurally related compounds is a result of inhibition of ABC transporters such as p\u2010glycoprotein,34 which are additional targets of CsA, but most likely not of SFA.35 Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Reversan and Piperine, two more specific inhibitors of ABC transporters, supports the concept of a potential role of ABC transporters for HAV\u2010RNA replication.

Boxes represent coding sequences from HAV or HCV (black) or reporter genes / selectable markers (white). Cis\u2010acting elements are depicted according to their proposed secondary structures. (B) Replication fitness of HAV or HCV subgenomic replicons in Huh7, Huh7\u2010Lunet, or Huh7.5 hepatoma cells. 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after electroporation of HAV or HCV reporter replicons, cells were harvested for measurement of luciferase activity. Graph represents mean and standard deviation (SD) of r.l.u. normalized to 4 hours. Data are derived from two independent experiments and depicted in logarithmic scale (n = 2). (C) Huh7\u2010Lunet cells were transfected with 0.1\u20101.0 \u00b5g of RNA of selectable subgenomic replicons of HCV (BlrCon1) or HAV (BlrHAV) and selected for blasticidin resistance (2.5 \u00b5g/mL). Colonies were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and colony number per \u00b5g RNA was calculated (n = 2). (D) HCV\u2010, but not HAV\u2010RNA, replication depends on miR122. Hep3B hepatoma cells, naturally devoid of endogenous miR122, were electroporated with HAV or HCV subgenomic replicons either alone or in combination with miR122 or the inactive mutant, miR122_A4U. Graph shows mean and SD of r.l.u. measured from two independent experiments performed with triplicates (n = 2) at the given time points after electroporation. Data are represented in logarithmic scale and were not normalized owing to the effect of miR122 on HCV\u2010RNA stability and translation efficiency, which is evident already 4 hours after transfection. Note that owing to presence of the PI upstream of the luciferase coding sequence in the H77 reporter replicon construct, luciferase translation is independent of miR122.
