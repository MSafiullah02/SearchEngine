            "text": "Acute otitis media is generally regarded as a bacterial infection. However, many studies over the past decades have shown the close association between acute otitis media and respiratory viral infections. This association has been demonstrated by temporal coincidence of viral epidemics and peak incidences of acute otitis media in epidemiological studies [Henderson et al., 1982] as well as documenting viral infections in acute otitis media patients [Chonmaitree et al., 1986; Heikkinen et al., 1999] and it was already evident in studies exploiting conventional techniques, i.e., isolation of viruses from nasal aspirates and middle ear fluid samples or by using serology [Chonmaitree et al., 1986; Harsten et al., 1991] . The development of new simpler and often more sensitive laboratory methods for virus detection, such as antigen assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, has contributed to the accumulation of further evidence of this association [Pitk\u00e4 ranta et al., 1998; Heikkinen et al., 1999] . The most convincing evidence is based on virus specific intervention studies: a proportion of acute otitis media occurring during influenza outbreaks can be prevented by immunizing children with influenza virus vaccine [Heikkinen et al., 1991] .",

Human rhino-, entero-, and parechoviruses are RNA viruses and belong to the Picornaviridae family. Rhinoviruses are assumed to cause mostly mild upper respiratory infections, although more severe diseases such as pneumonia have also been documented [El-Sahly et al., 2000] . For human enteroviruses, the clinical expressions of infection range from severe paralysis to minor febrile illnesses [Chonmaitree and Mann, 1995] . Enteroviruses have been found by virus culture in up to 6% of middle ear fluid samples obtained from patients with acute otitis media [Chonmaitree et al., 1986; Heikkinen et al., 1999] . Cell lines used for viral culture vary in their sensitivity to different enteroviruses and some enterovirus serotypes cannot be isolated in standard cell cultures used in diagnostic laboratories [Pallansch and Roos, 2001] . The introduction of the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method has made it possible to study systematically the role of enteroviruses in acute otitis media in children. Parechoviruses, previously classified among enteroviruses as echovirus serotypes 22 and 23, are also known to be respiratory pathogens [Joki-Korpela and Hyypi\u00e4 , 2001] .",

Physical examination was carried out and interview data were collected during these scheduled visits. In addition, the families were encouraged to take the child to the study clinic whenever he or she had symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and especially if acute otitis media was suspected. If an acute otitis media was diagnosed by the study doctor, myringotomy was performed and middle ear fluid specimens were drawn from the inflamed ear(s) with an electric suction apparatus into a sterile collector. In addition, a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained using a sterile pediatric mucus extractor.",

It is likely that the true proportion of acute otitis media events with an associated virus infection is even higher as we did not test for all respiratory viruses [Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2000; Hirsil\u00e4 et al., 2001; van den Hoogen et al., 2001] and the antigen detection test used is known to find only part of the corresponding infections [R\u00e4 ty et al., 2003] . Rhinoviruses were detected most frequently, but enteroviruses also appeared to be a major group among respiratory pathogens. For these two virus groups, a PCR method was used whereas RSV, the next virus in order, was detected only by antigen test. In earlier studies, it has been suggested that RSV is one of the most important viruses contributing to development of acute otitis media [Henderson et al., 1982; Heikkinen et al., 1999] . The prevalences of different virus groups were the same between the two studies. Likewise, the seasonal and age specific occurrence rates of different viruses were similar in both studies and in agreement with our previous preliminary report of the Cohort Study based on nasopharyngeal specimens only [Vesa et al., 2001] .",

Varying epidemiology is another confounding factor in complicating the comparison of results from different studies. It was unexpected to note that the proportion of acute otitis media events coinciding with rhinovirus infections was smaller in the Vaccine Trial than in the Cohort Study even though the combined cell-culture-PCR method used in the latter study had a sensitivity of 66% only as compared to that of direct RT-PCR used in the Vaccine Trial [Blomqvist et al., 1999] .",

Although in the Vaccine Trial ten different respiratory viruses were tested for, there are still many known and probably also unknown viruses that may cause respiratory infections in children. Coronaviruses and influenza C viruses cause upper respiratory infections, but to a lesser degree in this age group [Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2000; Hirsil\u00e4 et al., 2001] . We have previously reported results from a sample of specimens derived from the FinOM Cohort Study revealing that about 3% of tested nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from the children presenting with symptoms of respiratory infection contained human coronavirus RNA [Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2000] . The recently discovered human metapneumoviruses have been reported to cause in children respiratory infections that clinically resemble RSV infections [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] . In both the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study and Vaccine Trial, the study of seasonal prevalence revealed a difference in winter 1996-1997 between all acute otitis media events and those associated with documented viral infections. One could speculate that this divergence reflects an epidemic caused by one of the known viruses not included in our virus detection panel, or an epidemic due to an unknown virus.",

Validation analysis of the method showed that the enterovirus probe also detects some rhinovirus prototypes. Although a sample was interpreted to be positive for enterovirus only if it was negative for the rhinovirus probe some of these samples may have contained aberrantly reacting rhinoviruses. Conventional identification of enteroviruses by virus culture and serotyping by neutralizing antibodies is difficult and time consuming. Better methods are desirable for reliable differentiation of enteroviruses from rhinoviruses and for easy identification of the relevant serotypes. Previously, a specific viral diagnosis of upper respiratory infection or acute otitis media had little clinical relevance. However, therapy for virus infections is developing rapidly and efficient drugs exist for some viruses [Hayden, 2001; Meissner, 2001; Ison et al., 2002] . This poses new requirements for virus diagnostics and new opportunities to treat viral infections in selected target groups. For example, treatment of children with frequently recurring infections or prevention of acute otitis media under specific situations might be feasible in the future.",
