IBV has a single\u2010stranded positive sense RNA genome that is 27.6 kb in size (Boursnell et al., 1987). Genome of IBV directs the synthesis of six major single\u2010stranded polyadenylated RNA species in infected chicken embryo kidney cells. These RNAs include the intracellular form of the genome (RNA F) and five smaller RNA species (RNAs A, B, C, D and E) (Stern and Kennedy, 1980). mRNA A, C and E encode three major structural proteins: the spike protein (S), the membrane (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively. The S protein of IBV is cleaved post\u2010translationally into N\u2010terminal S1 and C\u2010terminal S2 proteins (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986).",

The different serotypes, subtypes or variants of IBV was thought to be generated by nucleotide point mutations, insertions, deletions or RNA recombinations of S1 genes (Kusters et al., 1987; Cavanagh et al., 1988; Cavanagh and Davis, 1988; Wang et al., 1993, 1994; Jia et al., 1995), which were responsible for outbreaks of IB in the vaccinated chicken flocks. In addition to serotype changes, the genetic variation may result in changes of the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the virus, which lead to the generation of new IBV pathotypes.",

Moreover, nephropathogenic IBVs in China also showed relatively high similarity with T strain while low similarity with Gray, Holte or B1648 which were all classical nephropathogenic IBVs, indicating that the origin of nephropathogenic IBV in China might have something to do with T serotype strains. A lot of point mutation and an insertion of \u2032CTTTTTAATTATACTAACGGA\u2032 fragment were found in S1 gene of the isolate SC021202 and J compared with other IBV strains. Nephropathogenic IBV isolate J was isolated in 1998 and was defined to be a new variant IBV isolate by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of S1 gene (Zhou et al., 1998; He et al., 2000; Zhou and He, 2000). Although the S1 gene of SC021202 shared a relatively high identity with isolate J including the same insertion mutation, but a lot of point mutation had occurred in S1 gene of the isolate SC021202 compared with that of the isolate J. These characteristics of isolate SC021202 showed that it is a new variant IBV isolate and might directly evolved from other field IBV strains which was currently epidemic in China. Nevertheless, it must be pointed that genotype doesn't always agree with serotype and more work still need to be done to clarify the precise serotype of currently epidemic IBVs. As nephropathogenic IB are epidemic in many provinces in China currently and poor protection was presented by traditional vaccine, it is strongly suggested that nephropathogenic IBV strains should be screened for vaccine using.",

            "text": "Reported nephropathogenic IBV strains were not identical in virulence and ability to cause renal lesion (Winterfield and Albassam, 1984; Chandra, 1987). The virulence of the isolate SC021202 was relatively strong and damaged mainly kidney of chickens although slight lesions in respiratory tract were also observed. As shown in Fig. 4, the tissue tropism of IBVs didn't always agree with their similarity of S1 gene. For example, the preventriculus\u2010origon isolate QXIBV shared 89.9% similarity in S1 protein with nephropathogenic isolate Z while it shared only 76.4% similarity in S1 protein with the preventriculus\u2010origin isolate ZJ971(Zhou, 2000). The molecular basis for IBV tissue tropism is not known. Nevertheless, based on the S1 sequence data, amino acid residues located between 99 and 127 sites may play a role in the different pathogenesis of these viruses (Kwon and Jackwood, 1995; Sapats et al., 1996). It is known that 5\u2032 hypervariable regions of the S1 protein (residues 56\u201369 and 117\u2013131) contribute to serotyping or neutralizing activities (Koch et al., 1990) and this region shares a similarity between serotypes and genotypes of IBV (Kusters et al., 1989; Wang and Huang, 2000).",
