This article reviews the current understanding of how virally infected hosts are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia as well as the management of this important complication of viral infections.",

Although the precise rates of secondary bacterial infections are difficult to quantify because of a lack of comprehensive reporting systems and the impracticality of obtaining microbiologic testing in all patients with respiratory infections, bacterial pneumonia is estimated to complicate from 0.5% to 6% of influenza infections, with higher rates among hospitalized patients in intensive care units and fatal cases. Influenza is one of many viral pathogens that have been associated with bacterial coinfections.14 Human parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus, and coronavirus are also commonly associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Of these viruses, influenza is arguably most important given its continuously evolving virulence factors and the sheer number of individuals infected on an annual basis. Given its public health importance, as well as the fact that influenza is the most extensively studied, bacterial pneumonia following influenza infections is the primary focus of this article.",

Furthermore, the increased availability of sialic acid in the airway has been shown to promote growth and proliferation of pneumococcus, which uses this moiety as a nutrient source.67 In murine models, higher levels of viral neuraminidase are associated with increased severity of secondary bacterial infection, whereas treatment with oseltamivir decreases bacterial adherence to epithelial cells.68, 69, 70\n",

In addition, in mouse models of S pneumoniae and S aureus pneumonia, IL-12\u2013independent IFN-gamma production by neutrophils in the lung was shown to be essential to bacterial clearance, possibly because of IFN-gamma\u2013regulated production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).107, 108 These paradoxic findings in naive hosts versus hosts infected with influenza suggest that neutrophils recruited in the setting of viral respiratory infection are unable to mount antibacterial functions that would normally be activated by interferon-gamma, which may reflect distinct neutrophil phenotypes in the setting of viral versus bacterial infections.

            "text": "Differentiating severe viral infection from viral-bacterial coinfection is a common diagnostic dilemma at the point of presentation, given the significant overlap in symptoms and laboratory markers. Microbiologic culture results take days, whereas point-of-care influenza antigen tests are insufficiently sensitive. PCR-based panels for common respiratory viral pathogens are more sensitive and can be useful, but are expensive for routine use and are not able to distinguish between colonization versus true viral infection. Furthermore, in low-volume laboratories, results may not be available for days. On radiologic imaging, lobar consolidation with or without pleural effusion is presumed to be bacterial; however, multifocal infiltrates can represent either multilobar bacterial pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe viral infection alone. RSV and adenovirus have some hallmark features on computed tomography scan of the chest; however, imaging studies are generally unhelpful.112 Increased C-reactive protein level in the blood correlates with presence of pneumonia but poorly distinguishes viral from bacterial causes.113, 114, 115 Procalcitonin (PCT), another serum biomarker, is better able to differentiate the two.18, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121 In one study of coinfection, low PCT level was associated with 94% negative predictive value for bacterial infection, although in patients with shock, or in malaria endemic areas, it may be less reliable.121, 122 Thus, given the absence of rapid and reliable diagnostic tests, clinicians must always consider the possibility of secondary bacterial infection in patients presenting with severe respiratory infections during influenza season and manage them accordingly.",

However, pneumococcal vaccination did not have the same effect in a large study of elderly patients, potentially because of replacement of covered serotypes with those not included in the vaccine.135, 136 This finding mirrors data from animal models of dual infection.137 In contrast, vaccination against the M protein of S pyogenes seems to be protective against superinfection.138 It is unknown whether vaccination against other pathogens affects the incidence or severity of secondary bacterial pneumonia.",

Susceptibility is mediated by a variety of viral and bacterial factors, as well as complex interactions with the immune system of the infected host.

Novel approaches to identifying the individuals infected with influenza who are at increased risk for secondary bacterial pneumonias are urgently needed, given the ongoing threat of another influenza pandemic. Given the threat of further pandemics and the heightened prevalence of these viruses in general, more research into the immunologic mechanisms of this disease is warranted with the hope of discovering new potential therapies.",
