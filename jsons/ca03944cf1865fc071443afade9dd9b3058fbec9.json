The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. As of 23rd March 2020, there have been around 294,110 confirmed cases reported, with 12,944 deaths all around the world, affecting around 177 countries and territories. Milan Batista [1] used the logistic model in estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest of the World, which gave a reasonable description of the epidemic in those places. In this paper, we try to estimate the final size of the epidemic for India and also do daily predictions, that is predicting the expected number of infected cases in upcoming days using the logistic model and genetic algorithm with the data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources including the World Health Organization (WHO).",

The estimated initial doubling time (time required for the number of cases to double) is 3.6 days. Short term forecasting is given in Table 2 , which gives the predictions made for number of cases expected in upcoming days in India. We can see that the error percentages for predictions of the last 3 days lies within 5%, but the error percentages of initial predictions are relatively high. ",
