            "text": "Since the seminal work on the synthesis and characterization of dendritic molecules in the late 1970\u2019s, a variety of chemical dendrimers have been evolved for a number of applications in sensing and materials science.1 Informed by advances in the synthesis of artificial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligonucleotides using solid\u2010phase phosphoramidite chemistry,2 Horn and Urdea realized that this synthetic approach gives rise to the construction of fork\u2010 and comb\u2010like DNA oligomers (1 and 2)3 that could be useful as basic building blocks for the assembly of DNA dendrimers by means of specific Watson\u2013Crick base pairing. Indeed, their approach proved feasible and resulted in the development of commercial diagnostic tests for nucleic acids of pathogens, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus).4 At the same time, developments of dendritic DNA\u2010based superstructures were initiated by the groundbreaking work of Seeman,5 who demonstrated that DNA crossover motifs, so\u2010called three\u2010 and four\u2010arm junctions (3 and 4, respectively), are accessible by self\u2010assembly of designed oligonucleotides. When the junction motifs contain single\u2010stranded overhangs (\u201csticky ends\u201d), they can act as oligovalent building blocks for the assembly of dendrimer\u2010like superstructures that possess well\u2010defined structural features on the nanometer length scale. This pioneering work has led to the establishment of the highly innovative and vibrant field of DNA nanotechnology,6 in which motifs such as 3 and 4, and especially more complex ones, are used extensively as building blocks for rationally designed two\u2010dimensional nanoarrays, three\u2010dimensional wire\u2010frame objects,7 and even programmable dynamic systems with structure\u2010directing properties.8, 9 In addition to building blocks comprised of pure DNA, a variety of oligovalent DNA molecules containing chemical branch points have been introduced as components for DNA nanoconstruction. Representative examples include nickel cyclam (5)10 and porphyrin derivatives (6),11 branched phosphoramidites (7),12 trisoligonucleotides (8),13, 14 tripodal oligonucleotide\u2010functionalized modules (TOMs, 9),15 adenosine bis(phosphate) derivatives (e.g., 10),16, 17 as well as other linkers18, 19 for the generation of dendritic DNA structures.",

This approach enabled formation of the first\u2010generation DL\u2010DNA (G1 DL\u2010DNA), which possessed six sticky ends, thus allowing the enzymatic coupling of six molar equivalents of yet another Y\u2010DNA to produce second\u2010generation DL\u2010DNA. Subsequent coupling of additional anisotropic Y\u2010DNA allowed the assembly of higher\u2010generation DL\u2010DNA structures (G3, G4, G5 DL\u2010DNA), all of which appeared to be defined molecular species produced in high yields and high purity, as judged by gel electrophoresis, TEM (transmission electron microscopy), and AFM (atomic force microscopy).20 Thus, unidirectional and stepwise growth of DL\u2010DNA from Y\u2010shaped building blocks prevented self\u2010ligation and the formation of cyclic products, which partially hampered previous work on psoralen\u2010cross\u2010linked dendritic DNA (11).21, 22\n",

To demonstrate that the latter option enables novel applications, Luo and co\u2010workers employed DL\u2010DNA as fluorescent nanobarcodes for parallel detection of pathogen DNA (Figure 1).23, 24 Y\u2010DNA motifs were used to assemble a small library of different DL\u2010DNA molecules, each of which possessed distinct numbers of green (Alexa Fluor 488) and red (Bodipy 630/650) fluorophores as well as a target\u2010specific single\u2010stranded probe sequence (Figure 1 a,b). Detection of fluorescence intensity ratios of green (G) and red (R) fluorophores allows for unambiguous identification of individual DL\u2010DNA nanobarcodes (Figure 1 c) and thus for simultaneous analysis of various targets. Using DNA targets originating from pathogens such as B. anthracis, Ebola virus, or SARS virus, the capabilities of this approach for parallel detection were descriptively demonstrated by target\u2010specific sandwich hybridization on polystyrene microbeads (right image in Figure 1 c), and it was also shown that rapid detection of more than 600 attomol target could be achieved using flow cytometry.23\n",

As shown in Figure 1 d, an exemplary ABC monomer contained four functional moieties: a green and a red quantum dot, a photo\u2010cross\u2010linkable poly(ethylene glycol monoacrylate) (PEGA) unit, and one target\u2010specific recognition sequence. Two such ABC monomers, both of which contain recognition sequences for a given target, are bridged by hybridization with the target and thus form a diacrylate block, an ABC dimer, which can be photopolymerized to form a macroscopic polymeric material. Interestingly, the polymerization efficiency was very high and led to the formation of particles with nearly spherical shape and diameters of around 400 nm. Since the photo\u2010cross\u2010linking is only efficient in the presence of complementary bridging molecules, target\u2010driven polymerization could be used for detection of pathogen DNAs. Moreover, the ratio of two fluorophores in the ABC monomers can be changed at will, thereby enabling parallel detection of various targets. Notably, polymeric ABC nanospheres could also be loaded with model drugs and incorporated into HeLa cells, where they revealed low cytotoxicity.25\n",

To this end, Luo\u2019s group used 3 and 4 as building blocks for generating extensive polymeric materials.26 The building blocks 3 and 4 were equipped with self\u2010complementary (palindromic) sticky ends to be capable of self\u2010assembly and enzymatic ligation to form strongly hydrated and charged jelly\u2010like materials, termed DNA hydrogels. As the building blocks are mechanically flexible at their branch points, these polymers are highly irregular, which is usually avoided in the generation of DNA nanoconstructs of defined shape and surface patterns.7 In their initial report,26 the authors demonstrated that the polymer\u2019s physical properties, such as tensile modulus, tensile strength, and porosity, are influenced by the choice of the DNA motif used as the monomer building block, thus promising some degree of control over these parameters. Since gelation occurs under physiological conditions, the DNA hydrogels are particularly attractive for biological applications, and it was shown that they can be used for drug delivery and release or to stabilize living cells by encapsulation.26\n",

            "text": "Very recently, such DNA hydrogels were used as templates for cell\u2010free protein production (Figure 2).27 To this end, X\u2010DNA motifs and plasmid vectors containing a protein\u2010encoding gene, all of which bore the same palindromic sticky ends, were enzymatically ligated to produce a DNA hydrogel (Figure 2). Gelation was carried out in molds, thus enabling the generation of gel pads of 1 mm\u00d71 mm\u00d720 \u03bcm dimensions. To function as templates for in vitro protein production, the pads were then immersed in a cell\u2010free reagent cocktail containing the necessary components for protein biosynthesis, such as RNA polymerase and ribosomes. Expression of different functional proteins demonstrated that the gel pad system was up to three hundred times more effective than solution\u2010based synthesis, which is the standard approach of in vitro protein synthesis. Notably, the porosity of the gels could be altered by varying the stoichiometric ratio of genes to X\u2010DNA monomers, and it was shown that such variations affected the protein production capabilities of the gels. However, the reasons for this effectiveness are not yet entirely clear. It seems that in addition to high concentrations and close proximity of genes in the hydrogels, which increases turnover rate of biosynthetic machinery, the genes are also protected against degradation by covalent cross\u2010linking with the X\u2010DNA motifs.27 It also seems possible that the high ionic strength inside the hydrogel matrix may play an important role in increasing the polymerase\u2019s enzymatic activity.28 Although the exploitation of fundamental mechanisms will require additional studies, this work suggests a number of applications, ranging from commercial kit\u2010like products for cell\u2010free protein synthesis to long\u2010term perspectives in the arising field of synthetic biology, in which \u201cminimal cells\u201d are targeted.29 Since cell\u2010free protein expression of a multitude of proteins has been used to engineer metabolic pathways in vitro,30 it seems possible that hydrogel\u2010containing vesicles could be an option to replace genomic DNA in synthetic systems and thus engineer higher functional complexity in synthetic biological systems.28 Altogether, the recent developments in DNA\u2010based dendrimer research summarized herein promise exciting new directions in nanobiotechnology, in which new materials may be used for bioanalytical and biomedical applications.",
