It is considered to represent a monophyletic entity, on the basis of both morphological and molecular studies (e.g. Young, 2007; P\u00e9rez\u2010Losada et al., 2008). The family has an extensive fossil record extending back into the mid\u2010Cretaceous (Aptian, 125 Mya; Withers, 1935; Buckeridge, 1983).",

The genera were discussed by Withers (1953), who synonymized extensively, and the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (Newman, Zullo & Withers, 1969) included just three genera in the family, which would now be considered as scalpellids: Scalpellum, Mesoscalpellum Hoek, 1907, and Arcoscalpellum Hoek, 1907.",

Subsequently, Newman (1996) elevated three of these subfamilies to family status (Calanticidae, Lithotryidae, and Pollicipedidae), leaving eight subfamilies and 29 genera for the scalpellids.",

Young (1999: 186) subsequently applied cladistic analysis to the genera in order to assess the monophyly of subfamilies. He commented that, \u2018The characters used for supra\u2010specific taxonomy are homoplastic, therefore forming paraphyletic subfamilies\u2019. He also noted that the basal group Arcoscalpellinae and its constituent genera were probably paraphyletic, citing Trianguloscalpellum as an example (Young, 1998, 1999); however, Young's 2007 review of extant scalpellids followed Zevina's generic classification in detail, although he commented on the significance of growth\u2010dependent features in scalpellid classification, which had not been taken into account in previous studies. In his papers on scalpellids, Paulo Young seldom provided generic diagnoses, an exception being Amigdoscalpellum (Young, 2007: 59). A subsequent paper by Shalaeva & Boxshall (2014) refigured Hoek's Challenger scalpellids (Hoek, 1883), provided revised generic diagnoses based on the translation of Zevina's original descriptions, and summarized points of discussion made by Young (notably the 1998 and 2007 papers). A paper on the molecular phylogeny of Antarctic scalpellomorph cirripedes (Linse et al., 2013) implied the paraphyly of species assigned to Arcoscalpellum.",

Recently, Lin et al. (2015) have published a molecular phylogeny of pedunculate thoracicans using multiple DNA markers. Their scalpellid phylogeny (Lin et al., 2015: fig. 3) compares well with the results obtained here from morphological analysis. In particular, this work suggested extensive poly\u2010 and paraphyly of the genera. In this paper, I undertake a systematic investigation of scalpellid plate morphology, using both articulated individuals and isolated plates, and following the procedures adopted for verrucomorphs and basal balanomorphs by Gale (2014b) and Gale & S\u00f8rensen (2014), respectively. Polarity is identified from the use of the Cretaceous scalpellomorph genus Cretiscalpellum as an out\u2010group (see discussion below).",

A strong apicobasal ridge is present in Cretiscalpellum, but absent in Scalpellidae, which are characterized by the separation of the external surface of the carina into a dorsal, flat tectum (t), sometimes delimited laterally by tectal ridges (tr, Fig. 1D), wall\u2010like parietes, and the variable presence of polymetric structures called intraparietes (ip), which develop along the tergal margin, effectively infilling the gap between the carina and tergum (Darwin, 1851a; Withers, 1928, 1935) (Fig. 1D, E). They are not developed in Diotascalpellum rubrum (Hoek), R. regium, and Arcoscalpellum michelottianum, but are present in all other taxa and are large in W. stroemii (Fig. 3H). Tectal ridges (tr, Fig. 1D, E) are developed in Amigdoscalpellum truncatum (Hoek) (Fig. 6E), Amigdoscalpellum rigidum (Aurivillius, 1888) (Figs 3E, 7X), and Ca. striolatum (Fig. 7S). The interior basal portion of the carina may be notched for articulation with the carinolatera (clg, Fig. 1I). The carinal umbo is commonly apical in scalpellids, but is subapical in W. stroemii (Fig. 3H). Carinae were extensively used by Withers (1935) to characterize Cretaceous species and groups.",

In derived forms, the outline of the scutum is trapezoidal, because the angle between the basal and occludent margins (boa) is acute (Fig. 1F, G), and the angle between the basal and upper latus margins is obtuse (bua, Fig. 1F, G; Am. mamillatum, Fig. 3G; Am. rigidum, Fig. 3E; Am. truncatum, Fig. 3F; Ca. recurvitergum, Fig. 3B; Ca. striolatum, Fig. 3A). The trapezoidal form is exaggerated in Ca. novaezelandiae, W. nymphocola, and W. stroemii (Fig. 3C, G, H), and the rostral angle forms a process in W. nymphocola and W. stroemii (obp, Figs 1F, G, 3D, H, 8D, H). In the derived group, the apex of the scutum is sharply acuminate and incurved (Fig. 8C\u2013E, H\u2013J); there is a small flange on the tergal margin on which the growth lines deflect towards the apex, called the tergal surface (ts, Figs 1G, 8B\u2013D); the umbo of the upper latus rests in a groove on the scutum, marked by an inflection of the upper latus margin (Figs 3, 8C\u2013D).

            "text": "An unpaired, symmetrical rostrum is present in all thoracicans crownward of the Carboniferous Praelepas (Newman et al., 1969), with the exception of the Lepadidae. Although it is absent in a few scalpellids (e.g. Young, 1998), all of the taxa in the present study possess a rostrum, albeit sometimes a tiny one. In the out\u2010group Cretiscalpellum (Figs 4D, F, 10A) the rostrum is triangular, slightly broader than tall, possesses a triangular raised central ridge, and lateral triangular wing\u2010like processes (ls), which are overlapped by the rostrolatera. In scalpellids rostra fall into three categories: (1) broad, trapezoidal\u2013triangular forms, with a subumbonal surface, broadly similar to those in the out\u2010group, and a large triangular external surface (Arcoscalpellum michelottianum, Fig. 11I; Arcoscalpellum sociabile, Fig. 11E; D. rubrum, Fig. 11Q; R. regium, Fig. 11M); (2) tiny, oval\u2013rhomboidal rostra, in which the external surface is limited to a small apical region (Am. rigidum, Fig. 12Q; Am. truncatum, Fig. 11A; Ca. novaezelandiae, Fig. 12I; Ca. striolatum, Fig. 12M); (3) rectangular\u2013trapezoidal forms with a flat external surface that extends over the height of the plate (W. nymphocola, Fig. 12E; W. stroemii, Fig. 12A). The form of the rostrum, and its relationships with the rostrolatera, are among the most distinctive variable features within the Scalpellidae (see Figs 11, 12); compare the illustrations of basal scalpellids (Arcoscalpellum michelottianum, Arcoscalpellum sociabile, Diotascalpellum gen. nov., Regioscalpellum gen. nov.; Fig. 11E\u2013T) with those of derived forms (Figs 11A\u2013D, 12).",

The rostrolatera in scalpellids fall into two well\u2010demarcated morphological groups: (1) a basal group in which these are broad, low, and gently concavo\u2010convex, and in which the concave facet for rostral articulation extends over the height of the plate (Fig. 11E\u2013T); (2) a more derived group in which the plates are subrectangular to subtriangular, only slightly broader than tall, in which the rostral articular surface forms a short triangular facet on the upper part of the inner surface of the plate (Figs 11A\u2013D, 12A\u2013T).",

In Cretiscalpellum (Fig. 4A) and basal scalpellids (Fig. 2), the plate is overlapped by the carinolatus, and in all scalpellids the upper latus has developed a margin in contact with the carina, which is of variable height. In Arcoscalpellum michelottianum (Fig. 2C) and Ca. striolatum (Fig. 3A) this is low, and the upper latus is consequently subtriangular in outline; in other taxa the carinal margin is proportionately long and the upper latus is trapezoidal to subrectangular. The upper latus displays several significant morphological changes in the scalpellids, including the development of a discrete, short, straight margin in contact with the inframedian latus in Catherinum spp. (Fig. 3A\u2013C), W. nymphocola (Fig. 3D), and W. stroemii (Fig. 3H). Additionally, the umbo of the upper latus overlaps the scutum, resting in a shallow groove, in several taxa (Am. mamillatum, Am. rigidum, Am. truncatum, Fig. 3F, G; Catherinum spp., Fig. 3A\u2013C). In Ca. novaezelandiae (Fig. 3C), W. nymphocola (Fig. 3D), and W. stroemii (Fig. 3H) the umbo of the upper latus is subapical.",

            "text": "The inframedian latus rests between the subcarinolatus and the rostrolatus in Cretiscalpellum (Fig. 4A), and is overlapped by the subcarinolatus but overlaps the rostrolatus. In scalpellids, the inframedian latus slightly overlaps both the rostrolatus and the carinolatus plesiomorphically (Fig. 2), and has no specialized contact with the upper latus, although it abuts this plate in Arcoscalpellum michelottianum (Fig. 2C). The basal scalpellid inframedian latus is low, triangular, and the umbo is slightly inclined towards the rostrolatus (Figs 2, 6H, I, M, N, R, S, W, X). In a more derived group, including Am. mamillatum (Fig. 3G), Am. rigidum (Figs 3E, 7W), and Am. truncatum (Figs 1B, 6C, D), the plate is tall and triangular, and does not always contact the upper latus. The umbo is in an apical position in the species of Amigdoscalpellum, Arcoscalpellum, Diotascalpellum gen. nov., Graviscalpellum, and Regioscalpellum gen. nov. investigated herein. In all other scalpellids studied, the inframedian latus has a subapical umbo (central to basal), and has developed short, discrete articulation surfaces with both the scutum and the upper latus (Ca. novaezelandiae, Fig. 7M, O; Ca. striolatum, Fig. 7R, T; W. nymphocola, Fig. 7H, J; W. stroemii, Fig. 7C, E). The inframedian latus has an hourglass shape, with an expanded base and minimum width at the level of the umbo in Ca. novaezelandiae and Ca. striolatum (Fig. 7R, M). The growth of a polymetric shelf adjacent to the umbo and contacting the rostrolatus (Fig. 6G, H) is seen in Arcoscalpellum sociabile, and is developed further in fossil Arcoscalpellum (Fig. 5B). The shape and umbonal position of the inframedian latus have been used extensively in the taxonomy of scalpellids by Zevina (1978a, 1978b, 1981), as discussed below in the systematic section.",

The most important modifications involve the nature of this articulation. In Am. truncatum (Figs 6B, E, 10O) and Am. rigidum (Fig. 7V, X) there is a flat articular contact between the pair (purple in Fig. 10O), and the lateral surface is modified into three ridges and grooves that run from the umbo, and interdigitate (Figs 6E, 7X) over the plane of contact. In Ca. striolatum the ridges oppose (Fig. 7S), whereas in Ca. novaezelandiae (Fig. 7N), W. nymphocola (Fig. 7F, I), and W. stroemii (Fig. 7B, D) the articular facet has rotated to a vertical position, forming an inner, taller articulation (Fig. 7D, I, N), and the umbones form a separate, shorter articulation.

This is true in all taxa that have been studied, with the exception of the scalpellid Scalpellopsis (Young, 2001), in which peduncular plates are added before the final laterals. Thus, the youngest plates are usually found at the contact with the capitulum. The plates in scalpellids are added alternately in two series, sc\u2013l\u2013sr and rl\u2013cl, which correspond with the eponymous capitular plates. Plesiomorphically, eight columns of plates are present (Newman & Ross, 1998; Young, 2001), but some scalpellids have a reduced number, and calanticids and pollicipedids have generated a very large number of small plate rows (Young, 2001).

Additionally, although they have long been classified as falling within (Zevina, 1981) or close to the scalpellids, molecular analysis places the calanticids as sister group to all extant thoracicans except Ibla, thus rather far removed from the Scalpellidae (P\u00e9rez\u2010Losada et al., 2008). The genus Cretiscalpellum Withers, 1922 is abundant in the later Cretaceous (Albian\u2013Maastrichtian), and first appears in the Late Jurassic (Tithonian; Gale, 2014a). Although sometimes classified as a calanticid, the valve morphology is very similar to that of basal scalpellids in overall form and sculpture (Fig. 4; Buckeridge, 1983). Cretiscalpellum differs from scalpellids in its possession of paired subcarinolatera and a subcarina (Withers, 1935), and probably gave rise to scalpellids by the loss of these plates. It is therefore used as an out\u2010group to the Scalpellidae. The highly derived and autapomorphic genus Scalpellum was not included in the analysis (see below).",

He referred a single species, Scalpellum glauerti Withers, with a bifid tergum, to Scalpellum (Neoscalpellum), which was subsequently assigned to a new genus, Pachyscalpellum Buckeridge, 1991. Withers (1935) split Cretaceous Arcoscalpellum into three groups (A. arcuatum Gp, A. fossula Gp, and A. maximum Gp), based on numerous plate characters, most notably of the carina.

Cretaceous, Albian\u2013late Maastrichtian (Fig. 4N\u2013S). This represents the plesiomorphic condition for scalpellids, and displays significant similarities with the out\u2010group, including the divergently striated sculpture, the overlap between the carinolatus and upper latus, and the median ridge on the carina (Fig. 4C).\nDiotascalpellum gen. nov., based on the living Scalpellum diota Hoek, 1907 (for an extended redescription, see Chan, Prabowo & Kwen\u2010Shen, 2009), and including the Arcuatoscalpellum fossula group of Withers (1935). These forms are distinguished by the presence of a well\u2010defined inframedian latus surface on the carinolatus, and minor overlap of the carinolatus over the upper latus (Figs 13K\u2013O, 18A\u2013G).\nRegioscalpellum gen. nov., based on the living cosmopolitan Scalpellum regium Thomson, 1873, and including the Arcuatoscalpellum maximum group of Withers (1935). These forms are characterized by the presence of a crescentic polymetric shelf on the carinolatus adjacent to the upper latus. The overall morphology is remarkably similar in Cretaceous and living forms (e.g. Fig. 13G, H, R. regium; Fig. 18N, O, P, S, R. maximum).\nArcoscalpellum, based on the type species Pollicipes michelottianus Seguenza, 1876. Forms with a tall upper latus surface and carinal margin. Including the extant Arcoscalpellum hirsutum (Hoek, 1883) and Arcoscalpellum quadratum (Dixon, 1850) from the Eocene.\n",

            "text": "Cladistic analysis of shell plate morphology (61 characters used; Fig. 14) for 23 extant species of scalpellids, belonging to eight genera, used the Cretaceous genus Cretiscalpellum as an out\u2010group. This has provided the first phylogeny of the family, which broadly supports the suggestion of Young (1998) that large species assigned by Zevina (1981) to Trianguloscalpellum, in which all plates possess apical umbones, are likely to occupy a basal position. The tree (Fig. 14) demonstrates a clear morphological progression from basal forms, here assigned to the new genera Diotascalpellum gen. nov. and Regioscalpellum gen. nov., through Arcoscalpellum, to species of Amigdaloscalpellum, and on to Catherinum. The most derived clade includes forms assigned by Zevina to Weltnerium, Tarasovium, and Ornatoscalpellum. The morphological progression is shown pictorially in Figures 7, 8, 9 (carinal side) and 11, 12 (rostral side), from the bottom to the top of the page. Although these illustrations should not be taken as a real phylogenetic succession, they serve to illustrate the progressive morphological modifications that took place during the evolution of the family. The most important of these are described below.Migration of the umbo of the carinolatus from an apical to a nearly basal position (Figs 6, 7), associated with incurvature of the umbo and shortening of the lateral margin. This all occurred in the basal (pre\u2010Amigdoscalpellum) part of the family.Formation and progressive enlargement of an upper latus surface and elongated carinal margin on the carinolatus (Figs 6, 7), also during early evolution.Development of an articulation between opposing carinolatera, which evolved interpenetrant ridges (e.g. Figs 6E, 7X), then later developed a double symmetrical articulation (Fig. 7D, I, N).Change in shape of the inferior median latus from a triangular, through rectangular, to pentagonal outline (Figs 6, 7), accompanied by basal migration of the umbo and development of an articulation with the scutum.Dramatic changes in the size and shape of the rostrum, from a basal subtrapezoidal\u2013triangular form of equal height to the rostrolatera, to a small, oval elongate form half the height of the rostrolatera (Figs 11A, 12I, M, Q). In the most derived condition, the rostrum developed a triangular, smooth external face (Fig. 12A, E).Accompanying (correlative changes) in the rostrolatera, which plesiomorphically are broad and low (Fig. 11F, G, N, O, R, S), but became proportionately taller and subtriangular to subrectangular (Figs 11B, C, 12B, C, F, G, J, K, N, O, R, S).\n",

The most dramatic modifications within the family took place immediately preceding the evolution of Am. truncatum, in which there were 27 changes in character state, involving fundamental shifts in rostral, rostrolateral, carinolateral, and inframedian latus morphology, accompanied by a reduction in size, cuticular thickness, and pilosity. The importance of this node is reflected in nomenclatorial changes, with both the admittedly paraphyletic basal group and the derived group recognized as subfamilies (below).",

The oldest scalpellid, Arcuatoscalpellum gen. nov. appears in the early Aptian, at approximately 125 Ma (dates from Gradstein et al., 2012). Diotascalpellum gen. nov. (Diotascalpellum angustatum Darwin) first appears in the late Albian, at 106 Mya, and Regioscalpellum gen. nov. (R. maximum) in the Coniacian at 89 Mya. By the late Campanian, at 75 Mya, both Catherinum and Amigdoscalpellum are present (see below). These dates are significant because the appearances of successive taxa are congruent with the order of nodes on the cladogram; the only exception is the late first occurrence of Arcoscalpellum at 55 Mya. Secondly, they suggest that the bulk of evolution in the Scalpellidae took place over the 40\u2010Myr interval between the Aptian and late Campanian. This indicates that many of the extant genera have a Cretaceous origin, and that the modern representatives of the family record a large part of its phylogenetic history. The only group for which there is no fossil record is the most derived clade (Weltnerium).\n",

Plesiomorphically, scalpellids are thought to be hermaphroditic (Foster, 1980), and the most basal living scalpellids identified here are hermaphrodites (Diotascalpellum diota (Hoek) and D. rubrum). More derived scalpellids (many Amigdaloscalpellinae) are androdioecious, the hermaphrodites housing dwarf males inside the scuta above the adductor muscle (Darwin, 1851a; Yusa et al., 2011), and others are dioecious, with large females and dwarf males (Buhl\u2010Mortensen & H\u00f8eg, 2006, 2012; Yusa et al., 2011).

In the seas around north\u2010west Europe, S. scalpellum occurs from the low water mark to depths of 400 m, but other diverse taxa (Catherinum, Amigdoscalpellum, and others) only occur below 200 m, in the bathyal zone and below (Southward, 2006). The greatest diversity is found in bathyal and abyssal environments (Young, 2007); however, in the Cretaceous and Palaeogene they occurred commonly, sometimes abundantly, in shallow marine shelfal environments. For example, Diotascalpellum scaniensis (Gale in Gale & S\u00f8rensen, 2015) is common in coarse shell gravels deposited subtidally adjacent to a Campanian rocky shoreline at Iv\u00f6 Klack in southern Sweden (Gale & S\u00f8rensen, 2015), probably in 20\u201330 m of water or even less. Arcoscalpellum quadratum occurs abundantly in the shallow marine sands of the Bognor Rock (London Clay, Ypresian) at Bognor Regis, Sussex, UK (Venables, 1963), which yields a high\u2010energy assemblage of thick\u2010shelled bivalves and was probably deposited in 10\u201320 m of water. Oligocene and later records of the family appear to be from deeper\u2010water facies (e.g. L\u00f6ffler & Nebelsick, 2001; Harzhauser & Schl\u00f6gl, 2012), so their virtual exclusion from shelf seas (except Scalpellum) appears to date approximately to the end of the Eocene. There is no obvious reason for this change, as there do not appear to be dramatic differences between Eocene and later shelfal faunas or habitats.",

The problem here is the apparent absence of cirripedes in deep\u2010water fossiliferous facies, particularly of Late Mesozoic age, which may be a result simply of their being overlooked. The presence of the deep\u2010water Catherinum and Amigdoscalpellum in upper Campanian chalks of the UK, at the height of the Cretaceous sea level high (200 m above present; Hancock, 1990), however, could be taken as evidence that they had a long history in the deep sea about which we know very little.",

He identified two morphological trends within the group: a tendency to plate reduction, and displacement of the umbo of the carinolatus to a subapical position. For material from the Cretaceous, Withers (1935) identified three groups of Arcoscalpellum (then used to cover most fossil scalpellids), the A. arcuatum Gp, the A. maximum Gp, and the A. fossula Gp, distinguished by numerous plate characters. Zullo (1990) was able to trace the persistence of the two last\u2010named groups from the Cretaceous into the Palaeogene. The new classification presented here builds on the observations of Withers, Zullo, and Young, and identifies five genera, four of which are extant, which reflect the progressive evolution of scalpellines during and since the Cretaceous (see above). These are based largely on detailed characters of the carinolatus, and its articulation with the carina and upper latus. The reclassification permits fossil taxa all traditionally assigned to Arcoscalpellum (Withers, 1935, 1953) to be placed in natural groupings with extant taxa. Two of the groups described here were referred to Trianguloscalpellum Zevina (1978a), by Zevina (1981) and Young (1998, 2007); however, the type species of this genus, S. balanoides Hoek, 1883, is a highly derived form that has additional primordial valves on the inframedian latus and some peduncular plates (see Broch, 1922), and is a hermaphrodite (Yusa et al., 2011). It is possibly related to R. gigas, with which it shares a tall articulation between the paired carinolatera.",

Subsequently, the genus was treated as a junior synonym of Anguloscalpellum Zevina, 1978b, because Zevina (1981) had included S. pedunculatum in that genus (e.g. Young, 2007); however, the type species of Anguloscalpellum, Scalpellum angulare Nilsson\u2010Cantell, 1930, falls within the genus Weltnerium as redefined in this paper (trapezoidal scutum; deep, transversely elongated receptacle for dwarf male; rostrum with broad triangular external surface), and is evidently not related closely to S. pedunculatum. Therefore, Graviscalpellum is resurrected from synonomy to include both the extant G. regina (Pilsbry, 1907) and a number of fossil species from the Oligocene\u2013Miocene of New Zealand (Buckeridge, 1983). The molecular phylogeny of Lin et al. (2015: fig. 3) shows G. regina and G. pedunculatum as closly related taxa.",

            "text": "This group is essentially identical with group B of Lin et al.'s (2015: fig. 3) molecular analysis, which includes a number of species studied here. The subdivision of this derived clade of scalpellids is provisional. The group is sharply and precisely defined by morphological characters, and the cladistic analysis indicates the direction of evolution; however, characters within the group are partly gradational.The shape and relationships of the inferior median latus, used extensively in taxonomy by Zevina (1978a, 1978b, 1981; see also Young, 2007; Shalaeva & Boxshall, 2014). Plesiomorphically, by comparison with the out\u2010group, this is (1) triangular, (2) its apical margin does not extend to the scutum and upper latus, and (3) its umbo is apical (Figs 3, 6, 7). Note that there is considerable change in the shape and position of the umbo during ontogeny (Young, 2007). The development of two discrete surfaces, contacting the scutum and upper latus, respectively, appears to be a good synapomorphy of a more derived group of amigdoscalpellines, which is closely, and concomitantly, paralleled by the basal migration of the umbo. There also appears to be a division between a group with an hourglass\u2010shaped (\u2018waisted\u2019) inferior median latus (more basal) and a derived group in which the pentagonal plate is relatively broad, the lateral surfaces are parallel, and the umbo has migrated to the rostral margin.Contact between the carinolatera, beneath the carina. The polarity can be determined by the fact that all taxa with a triangular inferior median latus (evidently plesiomorphic) also possess a highly modified contact that is marked by interdigitating, alternate ridges radiating down from the umbo of the plate (Figs 6E, 7X). The more derived character state is a symmetrical contact, in which either a few ridges oppose precisely (e.g. Ca. recurvitergum; Fig. 7S), or in which the articulation is divided into a more basal, flat, slightly protruding contact surface and and upper, depressed, and more horizontal contact, a lower extension of the carinal surface (e.g. Catherinum novaezelandiae; Fig. 7N).The nature of the contact between the scutum and upper latus. Plesiomorphically (e.g. Fig. 2), this is a simple, straight contact with no overlap, but in more derived taxa the slightly recurved apex of the upper latus rests in a groove on the scutum (e.g. Fig. 3A, B, E\u2013G). A notch is present in the upper latus margin of the scutum at the same level (Fig. 8C\u2013D).A sharp, acuminate, incurved umbonal tip on the scutum, incorporating the primordial valve, is present in more derived forms (Fig. 8C\u2013D).The shape of the scutum changes during the evolutionary history of the scalpellids, from a subtriangular plesiomorphic form, in which the basal\u2010occludent and basal\u2010upper latus margins are at nearly right angles (Fig. 8A, E), to become progressively more trapezoidal (Fig. 8C, D, G, H). This is brought about by the increasingly acute basal\u2010occludent angle and the increasingly obtuse basal\u2010upper latus angle (Fig. 1F).The shape of the rostrum, and the extent and geometry of its external and internal surfaces. In Amigdoscalpellum and Catherinum, the rostra are oval, elongate, and very small, less than half the height of the rostrolatera. In the derived Weltnerium, the rostrum has a trapezoidal external surface, and the rostrum has the same height as the rostrolatera.The shape and proportional size of the internal depression, between the umbo and the scutal adductor, which serves to accommodate dwarf males. In basal amigdoscalpellines, this is a U\u2010shaped notch, extending variably inwards from the occludent surface.Surface sculpture. The basal amigdaloscalpelline Amigdoscalpellum possesses a ubiquitous radial sculpture of raised, rounded ridges on all plates except the carina (e.g. Am. truncatum and Am. rigidum). Species of Catherinum have variable sculpture, from entirely smooth to possessing variably developed radiating ridges, which increase during ontogeny (Young, 2007). Species of Weltnerium are smooth, except for a variable coarse sculpture in W. stroemii.\n",

For example, there are taxa in which the inframedian latus is hourglass shaped and there is significant overlap between the upper latus and the scutum, but which retain an interdigitating contact between the carinolatera (e.g. Young, 2007). Thus, there appears to be a limit to the use of morphological characters for defining clades, and the ultimate resolution may only be achieved by molecular analysis. However, the present study, and the examination of available material and literature, supports subdivision into three genera, using characters of the inframedian latus (Zevina, 1978a, 1978b, 1981).",

The terga are similar in shape, but the scutal margin is convex in Ca. hispidum and straight in Ca. anglicum sp. nov. Three divergent ribs run from the umbo, adjacent to the occludent margin in Ca. anglicum sp. nov., but these are absent in the living species (Fig. 19Q, R). The scuta both possess an incurved umbo, and a large, deep pit for dwarf males (Fig. 19J\u2013O), which is directed slightly more transversely in Ca. hispidum. The carinolatera are similar in shape (Fig. 19A\u2013D, F\u2013H), but the tergal margin is longer in Ca. anglicum sp. nov.

In A\nrcoscalpellum venablesi (H, I) and S\ncalpellum (B, C) the rostrolatus tapers ventrally, and the socket becomes an elongated trapezoidal surface. Scale bars: A, 0.5 mm; B\u2013P, 1 mm.",
