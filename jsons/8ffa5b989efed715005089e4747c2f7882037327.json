As was the case of many other major discoveries in science, interferon was a fortuitous discovery.",

When 10-day-old chick chorioallontoic membranes from chick embryos were infected with heat or UV inactivated influenza virus, a material was produced that interfered with subsequent viral replication. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7 .1. Influenza virus production (or inhibition) was measured by hemagglutination, the ability of the virus to interact and agglutinate red blood cells. They termed the interfering substance ''interferon''.The end point of the titration was the identification of that well (on a plate of small wells) with partial agglutination; the reciprocal of the influenza dilution thus observed was taken as the interferon titer (concentration).",

Using standard biochemical techniques, it was shown that interferon was a protein, was pH 2 resistant, could be precipitated by ammonium sulfate, destroyed by ether, and digested by trypsin-all characteristics of proteins. The stability at pH 2 was an important characteristic, later used to distinguish the original interferon (called IFN-alpha) from other later discovered interferons. Attempts to initially purify the interferon were unsuccessful. A very low concentration was induced and the investigators at that time were unaware that multiple types of interferon existed, so that even with the techniques of column chromatography available at that time, it proved impossible to purify a single type.",

That interferon was an agent with a very wide inhibitory range suggested that interferon could be used as a general anti-viral agent, much as the recently discovered antibiotics. As a result, three pharmaceutical companies, Glaxo Laboratories, ICI Pharmaceuticals, and Burroughs Wellcome (later to become the Wellcome Foundation) supported the research. The primary purpose was to produce enough interferon for use in clinical trials, and a second was to keep the patent for interferon production in the U.K., since there was the feeling that penicillin, a British discovery, had been appropriated by the U.S. (See Burke [5] for a review of the early days of interferon research.)",

They injected ultra-violet irradiated vaccinia (inactivated virus) into the backs of rabbits and subsequently inoculated them with live vaccinia at various times after the initial inoculation. The vaccinia replication was inhibited by the pre-treatment with the inactivated virus. They isolated this substance and called it ''inhibitory factor'' (IF). Further experimentation was difficult because of the system used. These observations were presented at the 1956 Annual Meeting of the Japan Society for Viral Research and later at the meeting of the Japan-France Biology Society held in 1957. This was really the first report on interferon but was not recognized as such until much later. The IF was later tested for interferon activity using rabbit standard interferon, designated as such by the International Committee on Interferons, and it was found to have an interferon titer of 300,000 IU, an astonishingly high level of activity. It is now clear that Yasuichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima observed the production of interferon in response to an inactivated DNA virus in the whole animal. Because this work was carried out in Japan, and originally published in a French journal, it was not given the recognition it deserved. (A fuller description of this study can be found in the review by Ozato and colleagues [7] .)",

Its purpose was to examine whether interferon inhibited the production of vaccinia virus following injection of the virus into the arms of individuals who had not been previously vaccinated with vaccinia. The result was limited inhibition of vaccinia replication; it was also obvious that much more interferon was needed if it was to be of clinical value, but it was not until the 1980s that enough interferon could be produced in a pure state for this purpose. Prior to gene cloning, it was extremely difficult to produce enough interferon for clinical use, even when attempting to produce it in cells in culture. In the 1960s there was a large demand for interferon in order to test it as an anti-cancer drug. Kari Cantell in Finland produced leukocyte interferon, in large vats, in quantities sufficient for some limited clinical trials. He harvested leukocytes from many sources and infected them with the Sendai virus, which greatly stimulated the production of interferon. However, even with these facilities, it was impossible to produce quantities sufficient for all the desired clinical trials ( Fig. 7. 2). How Does Interferon Protect Cells Against Virus Infection?",

Differences were found on the basis of cell types protected, and the stability of the interferons at different pH (Table 7 .1). The binding of interferon to specific receptors on the cell triggers a large number of biochemical reactions, leading to the inhibition of virus replication or maturation and the induction of further interferon and other cytokines. The system is much more complex than the early researchers of this field could ever have imagined. Using mice as a model, experiments were initiated to examine whether interferon produced in mouse cell culture culture could be used to inhibit virus infection in mice, If given in large daily doses, interferon did inhibit the pathological effects of the EMC virus, a virus causing paralysis and death in mice [8] . Antibodies were made to mouse and human interferon in rabbits that neutralized the anti-viral effect in the mouse and the anti-viral effect of human interferonalpha.",

Doublestranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from random mRNA from interferon-producing leukocytes (stimulated with Sendai virus) and cloned into an E. coli plasmid, known as pBR 322. Five thousand bacterial clones were screened by extracting plasmid DNA; they were expressed in frog oocytes, and those synthesizing biologically active interferon isolated. mRNA coding for a polypeptide with IFN activity was isolated, and the IFN was shown to have normal antiviral activity [13] . This research was done in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann at the University of Zurich, and supported by a new biotech company, Biogen. Fifteen percent of the shares of Biogen were held by Schering-Plough, which eventually sold the interferon as Intron A in the U.S. market. This major breakthrough in the cloning of IFN-a2a led to the cloning of other interferons. Meanwhile, other biotech and pharmaceutical companies entered into this very competitive market. The Wellcome Research Laboratories, one of the initial companies involved in interferon research in the U.K., extracted interferon from virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells, and Searle Laboratories, also in England, produced interferon from fibroblasts. Biogen went on to sell interferon-beta 1a (Avonex) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and eventually joined up with a company specializing in monoclonal antibodies, Idec, to form one of the largest biotech companies in the world. Interpharm in Israel began the manufacture and production of IFN-beta in Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture, and finally interferon gamma was cloned in 1981 at the Genentech Company in San Francisco. Thus interferon could now be produced in E. coli, yeast, and mammalian cells [14, 15] . Interferon cloning led to the development of the biotech industry, and for this alone it is historically significant.",

Each one has a slightly different amino acid sequence, different specific activity and antiviral spectrum [16] . Different cell types make different amounts of each type; different genes codes for each one. Very little is known of the biological bases of the multiple species and their activities, since most research has only been done with one of these, termed IFNa2. This may not be the most active of the alpha interferons; all the alpha interferons bind to the same receptor, and when one looks at gene (protein) induction as measured by a few key induced proteins, the same level of induction occurs in all cases, suggesting that a minimal amount of interferon triggers activity [16] .

A number of such molecules were produced, one of which had very high specific activity. This molecule had higher specific activity in anti-viral activity, and anti-tumor activity, as measured by the death of hairy cell leukemia cells, and the activation of natural killer cells [17, 18] . Eventually, consensus interferon was approved for the treatment of hepatitis C. A well-planned clinical trial was never performed to examine whether consensus interferon was superior for the treatment of hepatitis C than IFN-a2a (intron A) or IFN-a2b (Pegasys). However, in clinical trials of HCV patients who were not responsive to IFN-a2a or IFN-a2b, there was a 30-50 % response rate.",

            "text": "Cells of the immune system produce interferon-gamma: dendritic cells, natural killer cells (NK), both CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. Interferon-gamma is also induced by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, and by many growth factors. It is also induced during viral infections in vivo as a part of the immune system. IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of class I and class II MHC molecules and promotes the differentiation of na\u00efve helper T-cells into Th1 cells, activates dendritic and cytotoxic T-cells, and increases the cytotoxicity of NK cells. Thus it is a key player in the immune response. (For an excellent short summary of IFN-gamma activities, see http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/ immunology/students/spring2006/v_alvarez/ifn-gamma.html). IFN-gamma is an important component of cellular immunity and plays a significant role in cell differentiation, cell growth, and cell survival. In fact, if IFN-gamma were to be re-discovered today, it would not be called an ''interferon'' but rather an ''interleukin.'' IFN-gamma binds to specific receptors on the cell membrane known as IFN-cR. The bound receptor interacts with enzymes, JAK kinase (Just Another Kinase), which phosphorylates STAT proteins, which in turn interact with specific DNA sequences upstream of inducible genes that have sequences in their upstream DNA, known as ''GAS sequences'' (gamma activated sequences-see Fig. 7.4) . The spectrum of genes induced by IFN-gamma overlap, but with some differences from the genes induced by interferon alpha and beta [19] . One of the most studied genes induced leads to the production of a protein, IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase). This enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tryptophan (an essential amino acid in humans) catabolism. In culture, cells die in the presence of interferon gamma, unless supplemented with tryptophan [20, 21] . It has been suggested that this enzyme is responsible for T-cell tolerance [22] , is induced during pregnancy, and is important in the maintenance of pregnancy in humans [23] . However, this latter hypothesis is controversial [24, 25] . IDO may also have detrimental effects, being higher during septic shock and in certain types of cancers. Thus, the function of this enzyme, and many other proteins induced by the interferons, are still unknown. Interferon Lambda: Type III Interferons More recently, another group of interferons, called ''IFN-lambda,'' has been discovered. Recent studies with IFN-lambda indicate that it is close in structure to the family of interleukins, IL10 and IL22 [26] and shares a common receptor (Fig. 7.4) . It does have anti-viral activity, and can possibly replace IFN-a in the treatment of hepatitis C [27] . Since its discovery, the literature describing IFNlambda has ''taken off,'' and there are now hundreds of papers describing its biological activities, which overlap with the other interferons although binding to a different receptor. It may be useful in the treatment of viruses or cancers that have proven resistant to other interferons.",

Following treatment of cells with interferonalpha or interferon-gamma, hundreds of genes are induced, yielding overlapping spectra for each type of interferon [28] [29] [30] . Many genes are also suppressed or ''down-regulated'' and most of the changes in gene expression are transient in vivo in humans. Many of these genes are well recognized as markers of interferon activity, but their function in regulating the response to virus is difficult to discern. It is becoming obvious that interferons are in fact part of a family of cytokines that are produced by one cell, diffuse to and act on nearby cells, and so drive the machinery of the immune response. Interferons induce many cytokines, which in turn induce many other genes producing a complex cascade of interactions. Cytokine biology is an area of biochemistry too complex to discuss here, but it must be emphasized that it has become an important component of immunology.",

In answering these questions, one delves into the basis of the innate immune response and the relationship between the innate immune response and the induced cellular immunity.

IFN alphas and betas both bind to the same receptors, IFNAR1, IFNAR2, and IFNgamma bind to separate receptors, IFGNR1 and IFNGR2, and IFN-lambda to a third set of receptors which are shared with interleukins IL10, IL28A, IL28B, and IL29 [31] (see Fig. 7.4) . Interestingly, virus infection also induces these interleukins. Binding of the interferons activates a number of kinases, including a series of proteins termed JAK kinases (Janus Kinase) which phosphorylate tyrosine on a group of proteins known as STATS (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription). The phosphorylation activates and leads to dimerization of these STAT proteins. There are seven STAT proteins that have been recognized, each related to a different function in either the immune response or metabolic response. The function of these STAT proteins has been elucidated from ''knock-out'' mice, i.e., mice with specific genes (in this case STATs), deleted. STAT1 is involved with the IFN-a/b and IFN-c signaling pathway, STAT 2 also with IFN-a/b pathway, STATs 3, 4, 5A and 5B, and 6 with other interleukins (cytokines). These STAT proteins in turn form complexes with other proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences. In type I interferon signaling, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers combine with IRF9 (Interferon Response Factor 9, another family of transcription factors) to form ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor), which in turn binds to the ISRE (Interferon Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce what are termed interferon-stimulated genes. STAT1 dimers bind to another sequence known as a GAS sequence and interact with IRF1 to stimulate type II interferon genes (this is illustrated in Fig. 7.4) .",

After being taken up by endosomes or entering the cell through the cell membrane, viral components or viral dsRNA, which can only appear after initial viral replication, activate tolllike receptors or the analogous RIGI system. This is done through ''pathogen associated recognition patterns,'' which interact with toll-like receptors. This interaction leads to kinase production, enzymes that phosphorylate proteins in a complex reaction that in turn activate genes for interferon production through complexes at specific sites on the promoters of the interferon genes, by a family of molecules known as interferon response factors (IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-7). A similar family of proteins stops the induction and silences the interferon genes ( Fig. 7.6 ). These proteins may function sequentially. Interferon can modulate immune responses by its effects on Class I and Class II MHC molecules (see Chap. 6). IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-gamma increase expression of Class I molecules on all cells, thereby promoting recognition by cytotoxic T-cells that can destroy virus-infected cells. IFN-gamma can also increase expression of Class II MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells, resulting in better presentation of viral antigens to CD4 + T helper cells. Furthermore, IFN-gamma can activate NK cells and dendritic cells, which can kill virus-infected cells. As stated above, interferon induces many genes that are involved in gene regulation, cell differentiation, other cytokine induction and anti-viral activity. As discussed below, many viruses block interferon activity, as shown in Fig. 7.7 . Figure 7 .6 illustrates the pathway of an RNA virus. Viral double-stranded RNA, an intermediate of virus replication, binds to proteins known as toll-like receptors, which are proteins that alert the cell to the presence of a pathogen. A complex forms on the toll-like receptor or RIG I, another toll-like receptor molecule, and interacts with a number of proteins that migrate to the nucleus and activate the genes for IFN, which in turn then activate nearby cells.

At the biochemical level, these include STAT protein degradation, inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT proteins, and IRF-3 inhibition. Both hepatitis B virus and HIV have been reported to block IFN-synthesis and signaling. The mechanism involved for all viruses in cell culture are described in [33] . During hepatitis C infection, there is robust interferon-stimulated gene transcription, [30, 34, 35] yet HCV persists to replicate to high numbers in chronically infected patients, unless treated with very large amounts of interferon and ribavirin. Under these conditions, some 70 % of patients will still produce virus. One report indicates that HCV does activate the enzyme protein kinase R (PKR), which normally would inhibit host protein synthesis by phosphorylating an initiating factor eIF2a inhibiting host protein synthesis, it appears to inhibit interferon stimulated gene production, thus dampening the interferon effect [36] . Using a cell culture system and an artificial viral construct (replicon, rather than complete virus), interferon activity was inhibited by viral proteins NS5A, E2 and by the IRES element of HCV [37] . This emphasizes the need to work with systems as close as possible to the ''natural'' infectious process, since in man none of these mechanisms may be functioning. Viruses such as hepatitis B, polio, SARS, adenovirus, and even HIV have been reported to inhibit interferon activity in cell culture, yet many of them are sensitive to interferon in man.",

A small group of asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals were treated with IFN-a2b: 41 % had decreased viral titer, and no patients in the IFN-a group developed AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, compared with 5 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.02) [39] . However, 35 % of the patients in the treatment group withdrew from the study because of the severity of the side effects. Other clinical trials have not been so successful. Attempts to treat children with Japanese encephalitis with IFN-alpha were unsuccessful, even though this virus and other flaviviruses are sensitive to interferon in cell culture [40] . During the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003, interferon was used among many other treatments, but the data are inconclusive [41] . Overall, the effect of interferon on virus infections in the clinical setting has been disappointing. Although interferon is active in inhibiting many viruses in cell culture, it does not carry over to the clinic, and there are many reasons for this. Most viruses induce interferon at an early stage of infection, so that the effect of interferon on the virus is established during the course of the infection, and additional amounts may not make much of a difference.",

The experience with Japanese encephalitis and HIV indicate that once a viral infection has been established, it is difficult to eradicate the virus with interferon. Even in cells in culture, the timing of the addition of the interferon is crucial in inhibiting the virus. Long-term exposure to interferon-as in the clinical treatment of hepatitis C-may cause a decrease in white blood cells (leukopenia), leaving the patient susceptible to infections. Apart from the problems with the treatment, interferon therapy is expensive, i.e., $10,000-$20,000 for a 48-week regimen of interferon plus ribavirin.",

However, there was objective evidence of antitumor activity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and melanoma [43] . One of the first clinical uses of interferon (IFN) was in the treatment of a rare leukemia known as hairy cell leukemia, which results from over-production of mature (and abnormal) B-cells. The cells under the microscope have a hairy morphology, hence the name. These cells in culture are very sensitive to interferon [44] . There are approximately 500 new cases of hairy cell leukemia each year in the U.S. Interferon (alpha, or beta, which was discovered later) is the therapeutic of choice, and about 80-90 % of patients will respond to treatment with remission for a period. Interferon therapy did extend the life span in early-stage melanoma and early-stage CML; however, in clinical trials it is inefficient against solid tumors. In Kaposi's sarcoma, as occurs in AIDS patients, it was effective if injected directly into the lesion, but not systemically. A major problem is the large dose of interferon required in any treatment as well as the severe side effects.",

There were sporadic meetings during the 1960s and early 1970s, but without an official organization. A report in 1974 claiming that interferon produced by Cantell could be used to treat cancer motivated a meeting in New York, organized by Mathilde Krim to stimulate interest in interferon and its anti-cancer activities. Dr. Krim was an activist in medical research, and was a faculty member of the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. She was a well-known ''socialite''in New York and her party for President Kennedy's 45th birthday was quite famous. She later became an AIDS activist, recognizing early on the problems and ethical dilemmas of the disease. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathilde_Krim). Bill Stewart, one of the early pioneers of interferon research, founded the Interferon Society in 1982. The first formal meeting and the publication of the J. Interferon Research occurred in 1983. The society met once a year with the presentation of papers on the three major classes of interferons (a, b, and c) . The Journal of Interferon Research, only for papers on interferon, was established (although papers on interferon were published in other journals related to virology).",

There is also a Journal of Cytokine Research, which publishes papers on interferon research. We do not know how many cytokines (initially lymphokines, now interleukins) exist. The International Society for Interferon Research joined with the Cytokine Society in 2012 to form one organization for scientists working in both areas, which were obviously now interconnected.
