Bacterial co-infections may complicate and prolong paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay. Data on prevalence, type of pathogens and its association with disease severity are limited though. These data are especially important as bacterial co-infections may be treated using antibiotics and could reduce disease severity and duration of PICU stay. We investigated prevalence of bacterial co-infection and its association with disease severity and PICU stay. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of the prevalence and type of bacterial co-infections in ventilated children performed in a 14-bed tertiary care PICU in The Netherlands. Children less than 2 years of age admitted between December 2006 and November 2014 with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were included. Tracheal aspirates (TA) and broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) were cultured and scored based on the quantity of bacteria colony forming units (CFU) as: co-infection (TA > 10^5/BAL > 10^4 CFU), low bacterial growth (TA < 10^5/BAL < 10^4 CFU), or negative (no growth). Duration of mechanical ventilation and PICU stay were collected using medical records and compared against the presence of co-infection using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Of 167 included children 63 (37.7%) had a bacterial co-infection and 67 (40.1%) low bacterial growth. Coinfections occurred within 48 h from intubation in 52 out 63 (82.5%) co-infections. H.influenza (40.0%), S.pneumoniae (27.1%), M.catarrhalis (22.4%), and S.aureus (7.1%) were the most common pathogens. PICU stay and mechanical ventilation lasted longer in children with co-infections than children with negative cultures (9.1 vs 7.7 days, p = 0.04 and 8.1vs 6.5 days, p = 0.02).",

Potentially this number may have been higher as we used: a) a very strict definition of bacterial coinfection, ignoring 40% of children with low bacterial growth; b) 50% of children received antibiotics prior to sampling, which may have decreased detection of bacterial co-infections. We may also have overestimated the prevalence of bacterial co-infections as we used a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis whilst some children may have had a primary bacterial infection. This hypothesis is less likely though as the prevalence of bacterial co-infections in the RSV-positive group was comparable to the overall prevalence (36 and 37% respectively). The prevalence of bacterial co-infection is in line with previous studies that reported bacterial co-infections occurred in 20-45% of children with bronchiolitis admitted to PICU's [1, 2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Like our study, most data were retrospective and had similar limitations such as previous antibiotic use. A prospective study reported that 22% had a co-infection and 21% had low bacterial growth/possible co-infection [5] . Also, in this study more than 50% of children had received antibiotics prior to airway sampling. Most co-infections were detected within 48 h, a cut off that is used to distinguish pre-existing infections from ventilator acquired pneumonias (VAP) [11] . Although it is not possible to distinguish pre-existing co-infections from infections acquired by our invasive techniques the fact that most co-infections occurred within these 48 h suggest that these infections are not likely introduced by intubation or colonization of endotracheal tubes.",

Alternatively, prolonged ventilation may predispose to increased prevalence of bacterial infections (ventilator associated pneumonia) [16] . In our study the difference in duration of ventilation was only significant in the late co-infections which corroborates with the latter theory. A similar trend was observed in the early co-infections which could suggest that both hypotheses are correct. The association between co-infections and length of ventilation in our and other studies justify a trial to assess the role of antibiotics in reducing duration of ventilation and PICU stay in children with a bronchiolitis requiring invasive ventilation. Ideally the design of such a study should include a curative and preventive arm to evaluate both the role of pre-existing and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia. Except for a study assessing the role of antibiotics to prevent PICU admissions [10] , such a study has not been performed so far. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in ventilated patients has been studied in adults using selective digestive decontamination (SDD). D'Amico et al. showed that SDD given to adults admitted to ICU reduced VAP and overall mortality [17] . The data on the overall effect of all ventilated children admitted to PICU is conflicting however, but SDD appears to be effective in controlling respiratory infections [18] . No studies have been performed in the current subgroup of bronchiolitis patients admitted to PICU.",

These factors potentially may have contributed to an underestimation of the actual prevalence and underline that the number of bacterial co-infections in children with viral bronchiolitis in PICU is high. Alternatively we may have overestimated the role of bacterial co-infections in children with bronchiolitis as we recruited children based on the clinical discharge diagnosis of the attending PICU consultant. Although 4 of 5 children had a proven viral infection some children may have had a primary bacterial lower airway infection. This is less likely though as also in the group with proven RSV infection the co-infection rate was 36% as compared to 37% in the overall study.",

In most cases bacterial co-infection was present within 48 h after intubation and was caused by common airway pathogens: H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis.
