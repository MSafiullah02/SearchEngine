            "text": "In the poultry industry, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a key source of economic losses and may be responsible for almost 30\u201360% of mortality in young chickens (Berg 2000). IBDV mainly suppresses immunity by the severe destruction of B lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius (BF), thereby reducing the effect of vaccines. IBDV has been classified into two serotypes, serotype I found in chickens, and serotype II found in turkeys. IBDV belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of the family Birnaviridae that are nonenveloped, icosahedral double\u2010stranded RNA viruses enclosing two segments, A and B (Azad et al. 1985). The short segment B (2\u00b78 kb) comprises viral protein 1 (VP1, \u2018an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase\u2019; 97 kDa; Macreadie and Azad 1993), while segment A (3\u00b717 kb) encodes the major components of the virus and contains two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs; Spies et al. 1989; Kibenge et al. 1991). The first ORF encodes the nonstructural viral protein VP5 (17 kDa) and the second ORF encodes a polyprotein precursor (pVP2\u2013VP4\u2013VP3, 110 kDa) that can be trans\u2010cleaved by VP4 (28 kDa) to release pVP2 (512 residues, 54\u00b74 kDa) and VP3 (32 kDa) (Lejal et al. 2000). The puromycin\u2010sensitive aminopeptidase (PurSA) and VP4 cleave pVP2 at its C\u2010terminus to produce the transitional pVP2 (452 residues) (Irigoyen et al. 2012). pVP2 is further cleaved to produce the mature VP2 (441 residues) (Saugar et al. 2005; Irigoyen et al. 2009). VP2 (206 to 350 aa residues) is encoded by the hypervariable region (HVR) of IBDV and is responsible for antigenic variation (Vakharia et al. 1994). In addition to homologous recombination in segments, mutations in the HVR of VP2 and genetic reassortment events are also responsible for the variation in IBDV (Islam et al. 2001; Wei et al. 2006; He et al. 2009).",

The structural VP2 protein in IBDV is considered a significant host\u2010protective antigen. Indeed, vaccination with VP2 was able to induce protection against IBDV (Fahey et al. 1989). VP2 consists of at least two neutralizing epitopes and assists in the activation of virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies in chickens to protect them from vvIBDV. In addition, antigenic variation, tissue\u2010culture adaptation, and viral virulence are all associated with VP2 (Brandt et al. 2001).",

            "text": "The bacterial surface display of foreign proteins has gained attention in several fields of science, particularly in the development of vaccines (Samuelson et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2005; Rutherford and Mourez 2006). Narita et al. (2006) documented increased expression of the active forms of proteins on the surface of Escherichia coli by using the surface display expression system (HCE\u2010PgsA) and the Geobacillus toebi\u2010derived HCE promoter that drives highly constitutive expression (Poo et al. 2002). Due to the evolution of new strain variants, the traditional practice of using inactivated or attenuated vaccines has become less effective in controlling IBDV. However, compared to traditional vaccines, the recombinant vaccines adopted against IBDV have successfully minimized the risk of induction of bursal pathology or the reversal to virulence. In addition, recombinant vaccines are also helpful in providing protection against multiple infectious agents, reducing stress in vaccinated birds, and decreasing labour and vaccination costs (Mahgoub 2012). Thus, recombinant vaccines offer several advantages to the poultry industry, where vaccination is practiced extensively. IBDV recombinant vaccines with VP2 proteins have been developed using different methods and expression systems. However, whole bacterial cell vaccines are considered to have better immunogenicity than that of intracellular secreted antigens (Stover et al. 1993; Grode et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2005).",

In addition, lactobacilli have demonstrated intrinsic adjuvant activity (Perdig\u00f3n et al. 2001; Ogawa et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2017). Lactobacillus strains serve as live bacterial vehicles and can colonize the intestinal tract (Medina and Guzm\u00e1n 2001). Oral vaccination has been proven to be an effective way to achieve better colonization of bacteria and successful diffusion within the systemic circulation (Mestecky 1987; Mcghee et al. 1992). Additionally, oral immunization induced both humoral and cellular immune responses (Li et al. 2010). In the present study, we investigated a novel recombinant Lactobacillus delivery system against vvIBDV. The pPG612 vector, containing a surface display expression system (HCE\u2010PgsA), was used to construct recombinant vectors expressing VP2 protein on the surface of the bacteria with or without the translational enhancer T7g10 (Olins and Rangwala 1989); these vectors were named pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2 and pPG612\u2010VP2 respectively. We compared the humoral and cellular immune responses induced by pPG612\u2010VP2 and pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2 vectors in chickens. To date, the HCE\u2010PgsA system and T7g10 enhancer\u2010based vaccine strategy has not been reported for vvIBDV. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the humoral and cellular immune responses of chicken immunized with pPG612\u2010VP2/LP and pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP as well as the immunogenicity of a Lactobacillus system expressing the vvIBDV\u2010VP2 protein.",

The OD of the samples was measured at 450 nm with an automatic ELISA reader (EIX 800 Bio\u2010Tek Instruments, Highland Park, IL, USA).",

            "text": "Broiler production on a commercial level is still facing serious problems due to IBDV. Vaccines available in the market show partial defence against virulent and highly virulent IBDV strains. Previously, several studies have reported that DNA\u2010based vaccines successfully induced cellular and humoral immune responses against pathogens (Kodihalli et al. 1999; Fan et al. 2002; Serezani et al. 2002). Deoxyribonucleic acid vaccines against IBDV that employed the VP2 protein have been shown to induce antibody production, but the expression and protection conferred have been found to vary (Becht et al. 1988). In the current study, we evaluated the immune response to VP2 protein expressed on the surface of bacteria using the HCE\u2010PgsA system, since higher immunological responses have been reported from surface\u2010displayed antigens compared with intracellularly secreted antigens (Stover et al. 1993; Jong\u2010Soo et al. 2000; Grode et al. 2002). Lee et al. (2006) reported both systemic and mucosal immune responses against acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus with the S antigen (SARS\u2010CoV S) using the PgsA system in the L. casei expression system. OprF (a dominant outer membrane protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), FadL (an outer membrane protein involved in the transport of long\u2010chain fatty acids in E. coli) and PgsA have all been used as anchor proteins (Poo et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2004, 2005), but PgsA has been shown to be a better anchor for lactic acid bacteria. However, to date, no candidate vaccine against vvIBDV has been developed using the HCE\u2010PgsA system. Therefore, we tested the PgsA gene product as an anchor for the surface display of antigens. The HCE\u2010PgsA system has been used in vaccine development against tumours and influenza viruses, showing positive results. However, it has been reported that the HCE\u2010PgsA system expresses low levels of recombinant protein (Poo et al. 2006). Therefore, we introduced an extra\u2010ribosomal binding site (RBS) T7g10 (enhancer) in the HCE\u2010PgsA system and compared VP2 protein expression and protection against vvIBDV in the presence and absence of this enhancer. This synthetic sequence was derived from gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 called \u2018Epsilon\u2019 (enhancer of protein synthesis initiation) (Olins and Rangwala 1989). It has been reported that this sequence can improve the expression of poorly expressed heterologous genes. Studies have proven that the efficacy of gene 10 is due to the presence of a nine\u2010base sequence upstream of the Shine\u2013Dalgarno region. It has been documented that T7g10\u2010derived RBS displays 40\u2010fold greater expression than the typical RBS. Mammalian, plant and bacterial proteins have been expressed at high levels by the construction of a plasmid vector with a T7g10 leader sequence (Olins et al. 1988).",

Moreover, the immune response to pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP was significantly higher (P < 0\u00b705) than to pPG612\u2010VP2/LP. We also determined the bursal/body weight ratio (B/B ratio), survival and protective rates against IBDV challenge. The B/B ratios of the pPG612\u2010VP2/LP and pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP groups were both significantly higher than that of the pPG612/LP group (P < 0\u00b701), and the value of the pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/L group was significantly higher than that of the pPG612\u2010VP2/L group (P < 0\u00b705). Although the protection rate of the pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP group was higher than that of the pPG612\u2010VP2/LP group (87\u00b75 vs 75%), no significant difference was found between the two groups, which may be caused by the small sample size in this study. It has been proven that not only the humoral immune response but also the cellular immune response mediated by T cells plays a significant role in the control of vvIBDV infection (Rautenschlein et al. 2002). During the IBDV replication phase, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells show an influx into the BF (the site of virus replication) and other adjacent lymphoid organs such as the caecal tonsils and the spleen (Sharma et al. 1989; Kim et al. 1999, 2000). We examined the effect of vaccination on T\u2010cell responses upon viral attack, showing that the number of T cells significantly increased after virus infection. Cyclosporin A treatment was responsible for reducing circulating T cells and was involved in T\u2010cell mitogenesis, which in turn was responsible for viral burden in the bursae of IBDV\u2010infected chickens (Kim et al. 2000). T cell\u2010mediated responses have a significant role in viral clearance and are involved in the recovery from viral infection (Kim et al. 2000). The cell\u2010mediated immune system activates macrophages and natural killer cells in response to an antigen (Lukacs and Kurlander 1989; Harty and Bevan 1992). In IBDV\u2010infected chickens, there was an increase in the number of intrabursal T cells, while the bursae of uninfected chickens had very few resident T cells (Khan and Hashimoto 1996; L\u00fctticken 1997; Kim et al. 1999, 2000). Our results indicate that T7g10 may be responsible for the increased expression of the VP2 protein, thereby increasing antibody production that in turn produces a strong humoral immune response and subsequently maximum protection from viral challenge. Furthermore, a greater amount of VP2 stimulates the cell\u2010mediated immune response, which shows a better CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell response. CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic T cells which are involved in the lysis of virally infected cells, tumour cells and allografts, and play a crucial role in the immune response (Sharma et al. 1989). Upon activation, helper CD4+ T cells function as \u201cmiddlemen\u201d and trigger secretion and proliferation of various cytokines.",

            "text": "Cytokine production regulates host responses. Th1 cells are responsible for the secretion of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 cytokines and are involved in effective cell\u2010mediated immunity leading to the successful elimination of intracellular pathogens (Kunzendorf et al. 1998). Th2 cells are involved in the control of certain parasitic infections through the production of cytokines such as IL\u20104, IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 (Avery et al. 2004). The bursa of virally infected chickens is involved in the activation of T cells and upregulates the expression of other cytokine genes such as IL\u20101b, IL\u20106 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Eldaghayes et al. 2006). Cellular immune responses mediated by cytokines against vvIBDV in chickens are poorly illustrated and have not yet been broadly studied. In our study, higher concentrations of IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102 and IL\u20104 cytokines were detected in pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP compared to pPG612\u2010VP2/LP; among these, concentrations of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in pPG612\u2010T7g10\u2010VP2/LP were significantly higher (P < 0\u00b701) compared to pPG612\u2010VP2/LP. IBDV\u2010infected chickens had upregulated gamma interferon gene expression in spleen and bursal cells compared to virus\u2010free chickens (Khan and Hashimoto 1996; L\u00fctticken 1997). It has been documented that IL\u20102 has a significant role in regulating the function and development of T cells (Malek 2003). In mice, targeted deletion in the IL\u20102 gene has been shown to affect multiple target organs thus supporting that IL\u20102 plays a role in immunodeficiency and fatal autoimmune inflammatory disease (Schorle and Hunig 1991; K\u00fcndig et al. 1993; Sadlack et al. 1993).",

IL\u20104 is a multifunctional pleiotropic cytokine involved in apoptosis and gene expression in various cells including lymphocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts, as well as epithelial and endothelial cells. Investigation of IL\u20104 is required for the understanding of the Th2 phenotype of lymphocytes and for regulating cell proliferation (Luzina et al. 2012).
