The universal reverse primer sequence is introduced into the cDNA during reverse transcription. The design of the miRNA speci fi c forward primer is critical for the speci fi city and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR assay. LNA modi fi cation is a widely used method for increasing the Tm and the speci fi city of primer. Each incorporated LNA monomer increases the Tm up to 2-8 \u00b0C, depending upon the position of the LNA moiety in the oligonucleotide primer [ 57 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 423, "text": "[ 53 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 879, "end": 885, "text": "[ 57 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 142, "text": "(Fig. 46", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 188, "end": 201, "text": "(Fig. 46.1d )", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "qRT-PCR"}, {"text": "There are two approaches available for detection of qRT-PCR products.

Therefore, a melting point analysis usually required following the PCR ampli fi cation, which can be reached by using a duallabeled hydrolysis TaqMan probe.

This method also has a considerably larger dynamic range compared to microarray analysis.

Since then, numerous approaches based on different microarray platforms have been developed for miRNA quanti fi cation. The basic procedures of miRNA quanti fi cation using a microArray platform including (a) miRNA probe design and array preparation, (b) isolation of miRNA and labeling, (c) hybridization and signal detection. A schematic fl ow chart of the miRNA pro fi ling microarray is shown in Fig. 46. 2 . The design of the microRNA probes, isolation of microRNA from samples and the labeling of miRNAs are the most critical procedures in the miRNA microarray assay. The short length of miRNAs makes design of the probes more dif fi cult because the design of the probe is almost exclusively determined by sequence of the miRNA itself. Sequence of the miRNA determines the wider Tm distribution of the probes. Therefore, Tm normalization of the full set of probes is absolutely required since the hybridization is usually carried out at one temperature. To solve this problem, two techniques, LNA utilization or adjusting the lengths of the probes, have been successfully used to normalize Tm value [ 61, 62 ] . Quantity of miRNA is also very important for miRNA microarray assay, since the abundance of miRNAs in total RNA is very low and a relatively large amount of miRNA is needed in comparison to a RT-PCR assay. Conventional denaturing urea-acrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with a commercialized kit (e.g., the mirVana\u2122 microRNA isolation kit of Ambion, Inc. and the PureLink\u2122 microRNA isolation kit of Invitrogen Co) have demonstrated excellent ef fi ciency in isolating miRNA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 206, "text": "[ 60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1320, "text": "[ 61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1325, "text": "62 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 609, "end": 617, "text": "Fig. 46.", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Microarrays"}, {"text": "Labeling of miRNA is an absolutely key step for the overall sensitivity of the microarray.

Indirect labeling methods including labeling through miRNA reverse transcript, the RT-PCR product of miRNA or the in vitro transcript of miRNA. The advantages of indirect labeling are obvious, since the reverse transcription product of miRNAs are more stable and easy to preserve. In addition, miRNA can be ampli fi ed and labeled synchronously through PCR or in vitro transcription, which is very useful for lowabundance miRNAs. Although direct labeling is simple, this method has inherent problems including the fact that guanine labeling is not suitable for miRNAs lacking G residues, that T4 ligase labeling can introduce base bias, and that the procedure of chemical labeling is somewhat complicated.
