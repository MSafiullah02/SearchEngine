This COVID-19 was detected by performing real-time PCR from the lower respiratory tract specimen. All of these 41 patients had fever and pneumonia with abnormal findings in chest CT scans. More severe patients have higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1. Novel COVID-19 have some similar symptoms to SARS (e.g. fever, dry cough, shortness of breath) but there are some important differences, such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing, and sore throat) and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea [8]. Another study showed that a healthy 6 membered family from Shenzhen traveled to Wuhan in between December 29th, 2019, to January 4th, 2020, where 5 members were diagnosed with COVID-19. All of these 5 patients showed upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and diarrhea [3]. In between December 8th, 2019 to February 6th, 2020 only nine infants were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 positive and none of them had to undergo intensive care unit (ICU). Eight of these nine patients stayed in Wuhan or one of their family member visited Wuhan which again confirms the human to human transmission [22]. Human to human transmission is confirmed with this new virus [13] and the basic reproductive number (R0) was estimated at 2.2 [10]. Despite the lack of evidence of super spreader, at this R0 rate, this epidemic could be the most alarming health situation for China.",

Most viruses can mutate quickly and makes them easier to catch and spread, one of the reasons a person can catch a cold over and over again. Disproportionately, this attack is vulnerable to the population with a weak immunity system. Despite 70% genetic similarities with SARS-CoV, the novel COVID-19 also have some dissimilar symptoms from SARS-CoV [9]. But due to its novelty and time pressure still, there is no appropriate treatment developed. Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Research Center have used nucleic acid vaccine platform approaches to create vaccines for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, which are also being pursued. Using messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology may accelerate to finding a cure [12].",

            "text": "In Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), COVID-19 diagnosed patients received antibiotics (oral and intravenous) and Oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) side by side, Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40\u2013120 mg per day) was given as a combined in case of severe pneumonia. Severe hypoxemia patients received Oxygen support (e.g., nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) [8]. Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica and Shanghai University of Science and Technology mutually found a group of old medicines and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) that might present a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. They have suggested protease inhibitors indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, carfilzomib, ritonavir, and 12 other anti-HIV drugs, 2 anti-respiratory syncytial virus drugs, 1 anti-human macrophage drug, 1 anti-schizophrenia drug, 1 immunosuppressive agent and 2 old drugs cinnamyl amine and cyclosporine. They also recommended that Chinese herbal medicines such as, polygonum cuspidatum and shandougen (Table 1) possibly have an active ingredient that can fight against COVID-19 [16]. Another study indicates that the use of corticosteroid might not improve COVID-19 treatment because it can suppress the immune response and pathogen clearance besides improving lung inflammation [15]. A study of 138 patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University with COVID-19 positive was treated with anti-viral (oseltamivir), antibacterial (moxifloxacin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin) and Glucocorticoid therapy. Most interestingly 6 (4.3%) died and 47 (34.06%) patients were discharged with 10 days of median hospital stay. Out of 138 patients 40 health professional were infected with COVID-19 which confirms nosocomial infection capability of SARS-CoV-2 [18]. The first case COVID-19 in the USA has been recovered with the use of remdesivir (GS-5734), a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that is under development. In this case report, the patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime from day 5 of hospitalization (9th day of illness) but no improvement and at the day 7 (11th day of illness) of these drugs were discontinued and remdesivir was introduced. The very next day (day 8) patient health conditions became much better. He was afebrile and all symptoms improved except mild cough side by side his viral load also lowered to Ct (real time PCR gene expression) 37\u201340 which was Ct 18\u201320 on day 4 of his hospitalization [7]. Another in vitro (Vero E6 cells) study suggested the combination of remdesivir and chloroquine could be a choice. [19] This study indicates the use of remdesivir could be a major breakthrough for the treatment of COVID-19. Due to the lack of large clinical data, mass application of remdesivir still not elucidated. Another suggested drug was baricitinib, which is known for its rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Baricitinib can also inhibit AP2-associated protein kinase 1 and cyclin G-associated kinase which are important tools of viral endocytosis [14].",

National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine gave guidance for COVID-19 management in the Fifth Edition for Trial Implementation titled as \u201cDiagnosis and treatment protocol of novel coronavirus pneumonia infection\u201d. Here they suggested using \u03b1-interferon atomization inhalation (5 million U or equivalent dose, added with 2 ml sterile injection water, twice daily for adults), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (200 mg/50 mg per pill) 2 capsule each time, twice a day and also Ribavirin can be added (500 mg each injection, I.V. two to three times a day).

Till February 23th a total number of 78,811 cases are enlisted where China alone contained 77,042 cases. A total number of 2445 death (3.1% of total cases) were recorded which mostly came from Hubei province (2346) and globally seventeen were deceased with this infection [25]. Within 33 days (21th January to 23th February, 2020) the infection has been increased 279 times which made this COVID-19 even more dangerous than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. According to the data 5th February daily new cases (Fig. 1a) hit the peak (3924) where at 12th February we saw the most deaths (254) in 1 month of COVID-19. There was a sharp total cases spike in between 16th and 17th February (Fig. 1c) because China was started to report new cases on the basis of clinical and laboratory confirmation.

Infants can\u2019t wear mask, so special care protective measures are required which includes wearing protect masks by adult caretakers, washing hands before coming close contact and continuous sterilization of the toys and surface [22]. People with a good immunity system might have a better chance of survival. So, immune-boosting foods and supplements might be effective [11].",

At the train station, airport and bus station they installed a thermal sensor to detect the body temperature of the passengers. Each community in every city has taken special quarantine protocols. In this protocol, only one member of each family is allowed to go out once in a 2 to 3 days. Each time of outing everyone has to write down their detailed information in a logbook and while at return their body temperature has been measured and noted. Nevertheless, the major problem lies with the asymptomatic behavior of potential carriers which insinuate it doesn\u2019t show any symptoms within 2 to 10 days of invasion inside a host and still can spread the contamination [26]. Purportedly, infection transpires when someone doesn\u2019t have any noticeable symptoms which make it more threatening when comes to spreading controlling and identifying. The Chinese government already extended this year\u2019s spring festival holidays, so people can have time to combat with the current situation. It\u2019s a real irony that a couple of scientists from Wuhan Institute of Virology (February 2019) published an article which forecasted that China would likely be the next possible hotspot of coronavirus outbreak. Popular cultural beliefs in slaughtering the live animal to consume more nutrition and close contact with the bats were suspected for the potential reemerge of the viral transmission [6].",

At the same time these recovered patients produced their own antibody which can last longer than 6 months so, second degree infection is unlikely unless there is a virus mutation [4]. WHO and China National health Commission is trying to design specific vaccines by isolating the virus from the host cells. China\u2019s government took very cautious action immediately by sharing the gene sequence with the WHO to facilitate the vaccine invention to accelerate the assessment. Plasma transfusion from the recovered patients might show promises because the recovered patients already developed antibodies to fight against COVID-19 which could help to replicate same immunity to the infected ones.",
