The universally adopted strategy of reducing social interaction to avoid the spread of COVID-19, termed social distancing, has considerable implications for the ongoing care of chronically ill patients [5, 6]. Patients living with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and other similar chronic conditions require periodic check-ups to ensure prevention of an acute episode of illness and the effectiveness of therapy [7]. One such patient group is those receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin as these patients need their international normalized ratio (INR) monitored regularly [8].",

Regardless of the setting in which warfarin is first initiated, clinicians need to assess (or reassess) the indication for warfarin as outpatient therapy. Conditions necessitating warfarin therapy include atrial fibrillation [12], cardioembolic ischemic stroke [13], prosthetic heart valve [14], venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [15] and pulmonary embolism [16]), and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [17]. Some of these indications, such as ischemic stroke and prosthetic heart valve, require lifelong anticoagulation treatment, whereas indications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may not require indefinite anticoagulation and patients should undergo careful re-evaluation of their need for ongoing warfarin therapy.",

            "text": "Patients with prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who have completed 3\u20136 months of warfarin therapy may be considered for cessation of treatment where appropriate. Continuing anticoagulation beyond 3\u20136 months is not routinely considered in patients with a provoked episode of venous thromboembolism with transient risk factors (assuming the risk factor is no longer present), isolated distal deep vein thrombosis, subsegmental or incidental pulmonary embolism, or a high risk of bleeding [18]. Patients who continue warfarin therapy indefinitely for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism require reassessment of bleeding risk, since a high/very high bleeding risk may outweigh the benefits of reducing the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism event with warfarin therapy. Therefore, warfarin therapy may no longer be appropriate (however, re-initiation of anticoagulation may be needed once the bleeding risk becomes reasonable) [19]. Patients with atrial fibrillation for whom sinus rhythm has been restored, either spontaneously or deliberately, also require assessment of their ongoing need for warfarin therapy. Warfarin therapy is indicated up to 4 weeks after the restoration of sinus rhythm because of the high likelihood of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the first month after reversion to sinus rhythm and the risk of transient post-cardioversion atrial stunning in the immediate peri-cardioversion period. However, continuation of long-term warfarin therapy 4 weeks post-restoration of sinus rhythm should be guided by the CHA2DS2-VASc or CHADS2 score and consideration of the long-term bleeding risk using the HAS-BLED score [20\u201322].",

While DOACs do require periodic renal function monitoring throughout the treatment course (at least annually or when clinically indicated), monitoring is predictable and less rigorous than the INR testing required for warfarin therapy so offers convenience for both clinicians and patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic [23]. Moreover, important additional advantages of the DOACs include the lack of susceptibility to dietary interactions and markedly reduced susceptibility to drug interactions, which somewhat alleviates the need for the intensive in-clinic patient counseling required during initiation and maintenance of warfarin therapy.",

In addition, a switch to DOACs may be inappropriate in the following clinical situations that lack evidence or clinical experience: patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; pregnancy, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy; a target INR higher than the standard range of 2.0\u20133.0; severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min); severe hepatic impairment; active malignancy/chemotherapy; extreme obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m2 or body weight > 120 kg); or concurrent interacting drugs [33]. To further illustrate, DOACs are not used in patients with significant mitral valve disease because they were excluded from the clinical trials of these newer agents so further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of DOAC in this setting. A review of currently available data provided reassurance for the use of DOACs in patients with a body mass index \u2264 40 kg/m2 or body weight \u2264 120 kg, but whether clinically adequate drug concentrations can be attained with standard dosing of DOACs beyond these weight parameters remains to be determined [35]. Patient-specific circumstances such as issues of affordability may also affect the uptake of DOACs, since warfarin therapy is much cheaper than DOACs. Nevertheless, generic dabigatran is available in several countries following the expiry of dabigatran\u2019s patent protection. Also, nonadherent patients are unsuitable candidates for DOACs as the short half-lives of DOACs can easily leave the patient inadequately anticoagulated compared with warfarin therapy, and a lack of routine monitoring means assessing adherence can be difficult [36, 37].",

Commercially available LMWHs include enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, bemiparin, and nadroparin. LMWHs and fondaparinux have a better correlation between dose and anticoagulant response, permitting administration of a fixed weight-based dose without close laboratory monitoring [41]. Though the need for daily subcutaneous injections may make them an undesirable option from the patient\u2019s perspective, adequate counseling and appropriate training for patients or caregivers on the correct injection technique may overcome the initial anxiety. Patients or their caregivers should be able to demonstrate the correct injecting technique after receiving appropriate training. Pharmacists involved in dispensing LMWHs should particularly ensure the most appropriate syringe size is selected for the patient, and each patient should be provided with sharps containers for the correct disposal of used syringes. Fondaparinux is supplied in prefilled syringes, so selection of syringe size is not an issue, but patients should still be provided with sharps containers.",

Prescribing clinicians must assess complete blood count and renal function (and serum potassium for LMWHs) before initiating LMWHs or fondaparinux and during therapy when clinically indicated. Patients should also be weighed at treatment initiation to calculate the correct dose. Nevertheless, data are sparse on whether patients with extreme obesity should be given weight-based or fixed LMWH doses, but pharmacodynamic data in patients weighing > 100 kg suggest that patients weighing \u2264 160 kg may receive a full calculated weight-based dose of LMWHs [44]. Conversely, the anticoagulation effect of fondaparinux is uncertain in patients with body mass index > 35 kg/m2 [45]. Beyond these weight parameters, patients should be maintained on warfarin as their anti-Xa levels should be closely monitored to ensure effective anticoagulation, which renders the reason for switching to LMWHs or fondaparinux redundant [44]. Patients receiving LMWHs should receive appropriate education and counseling to ensure they are aware of the early symptoms of thrombocytopenia (unexplained thrombosis, necrotic skin lesions at injection sites) because LMWHs are infrequently associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with a meta-analysis reporting a rate of 1.2% in patients with venous thromboembolism [46].",

Thrombosis UK guidelines suggest extending the interval between INR testing to \u2265 8 weeks in patients whose anticoagulation is stable on warfarin with a TTR of > 60% and to 10 weeks in patients achieving a TTR of > 80% [66]. Generally, the major guidelines recommend that the interval between INR testing should not extend beyond 12 weeks, but flexibility could be allowed to monitor less frequently than every 12 weeks in the most stable patients, similar to those in clinical trial populations, during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for patients in self-isolation because of possible COVID-19 exposure [67\u201369]. However, INR testing intervals should be extended cautiously in carefully selected patients because a prospective study reported that a large proportion of patients with previously stable INRs were unable to maintain stable INRs during extended-interval follow-up (every 12 weeks) [70].",

Patients who have COVID-19 symptoms before or upon arrival should be advised not to attend for monitoring. In addition, a drive-through INR testing model may be possible, but the efficacy of this model is yet to be investigated. On the other hand, provision of point-of-care INR testing devices to anticoagulation service providers to facilitate point-of-care testing may reduce workload, for example, by reducing the need to transport blood samples to laboratories. Nevertheless, they should be adequately protected by personal protective equipment (e.g., face masks, gowns, gloves), with workstations disinfected after every patient.",

LMWHs and fondaparinux are alternatives if a switch to DOACs is not possible. Self-management and/or self-monitoring of INR should be offered to patients receiving warfarin therapy where both DOACs and LMWHs/fondaparinux are not appropriate or inaccessible. Lastly, patients receiving warfarin who are unable to perform self-monitoring of INR should undergo the usual in-clinic INR monitoring, with consideration of extending the interval between INR testing among suitable patients. For patients being switched to a new anticoagulant or who will be undergoing self-monitoring of INR, standard therapeutic patient education should be provided, and consideration can be given to tele-education amid the COVID-19 pandemic if local resources are available and patients are receptive to such communication method.",
