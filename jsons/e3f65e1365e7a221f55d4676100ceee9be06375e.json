Viral load could be higher in fecal samples than in 48 nasopharyngeal swab samples in some cases, likely due to oral transmission. 6 The current 49 standard operation procedure (SOP) in clinical diagnosis uses pharyngeal swabbing to collect 50 samples from the upper respiratory system.

Some patients had a documented 85 history of exposure and showed typical signs of ground glass opacity in computed tomography 86 (CT) scan; these cases were treated as COVID-19 cases with clinical diagnosis in China, most 87 of which were tested positive by PCR and/or antibody assays during disease progression and 88 recovery. Due to variations in viral load of different individuals, timing and anatomical locations 89 of sampling for PCR, some infected cases were tested more than once but never had a sample 90 with viral load that passed the PCR detection threshold. These COVID-19 patients could have 91 fully recovered without any positive PCR test results. Their immune systems, however, kept the 92 footprints of the virus, antibodies. By testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, it could be 93determined whether the suspected cases had a history of infection, even if the virus had been 94 cleared post recovery. To obtain a more accurate number of COVID-19 cases, the Chinese 95 Center for Disease Control and Prevention, along with scientists and doctors, developed a SOP 96 for screening suspected patients and confirming infected cases that showed negative results in 97 PCR tests by using SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody assays. A combination of information on 98 exposure history, clinical presentation visualized on CT scans, presence of viral genes, and 99 presence of virus-specific antibodies, was used for diagnosing COVID-19 in mainland China. Of 100 note, in an antibody (IgG) test trial conducted with 705 serum samples collected from 395 101 \"clinically diagnosed\" COVID-19 cases, more than 95% of the samples collected 21 -25 days 102 post disease onset showed strong positive results (An et. al., data not shown). 103 The schematic flow chart delineating the SOP of COVID-19 diagnostic process in 104 mainland China is depicted in Figure 1. In brief, suspected cases that exhibited any COVID-19 105 6 symptoms and/or have a confirmed history of exposure are first evaluated by CT scanning and 106 PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. These cases are then divided into three categories: (1) no signs of 107 pneumonia in CT scan; (2) atypical signs of lung opacity in CT scan; and (3) typical signs of viral 108 pneumonia ground glass opacity in CT scan. In these three categories, cases that are positive 109 in PCR tests are confirmed cases of infection. In the second category, cases that have atypical 110 signs of lung opacity in CT scan and a negative test result by PCR will be retested with PCR 111 and antibody assays. In the third category, cases that had a documented history of exposure 112 and showed signs of typical viral pneumonia in CT scan were reported as \"clinically diagnosed 113 COVID-19 cases\". 7 In February, in Hankou Hospital in Wuhan city, an antibody test trial with 114 serum samples collected from 395 patients, showed that 393 of these patients had a history of 115 infection (An et. al., data not shown), therefore, it is unlikely that clinical diagnosis would lead to 116 an over-estimation of COVID-19 cases in mainland China. Based on this scheme of diagnostic 117 process, as analyzed and published by the Chinese CDC, by February 11 th , 2020, there are 118 72,314 cases of COVID-19 reported in mainland China, among which 1.2% of the cases are 119 asymptomatic, 61.8% showed signs of pneumonia with a positive PCR test result, and 14.6% of 120 the cases are clinically diagnosed (Figure 1). 10 Since early February, mainland China started to 121 report asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 (infection + disease 122 symptom) cases separately, according to the 4 th edition of \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol 123 for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\". Antibody assays were adopted to retest suspected cases 124 that were negative in PCR tests, and by the end of March 31 st , 2020, a total of 81,554 confirmed 125 cases of COVID-19 in mainland China were reported by the National Health Commission of 126 China. 127 The goal of this editorial is to provide a concise and clear flow chart to depict the COVID-128 19 diagnostic process developed and implemented in mainland China. We hope that this helps 129 our readers better understand how the math was done to determine the number of reported 130 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mainland China. The math that results in the reported number 7 of confirmed cases in mainland China is clearly beyond pneumonia. Despite our general 132 understanding that COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus, 133 clinical diagnosis was often complicated by clinical presentations, individual variations in 134 patients and medical/laboratory operators, and sensitivity and specificity of tests. This diagnostic 135 process used in mainland China may not be directly applicable to other areas in the world 136 during COVID-19 pandemic, however it exploited current knowledge of epidemiology, disease 137 characteristics, viral genetics and immunology about COVID-19, and provides an example of 138 Dr. Avery August at Cornell University for critical reading, Dr. Pengcheng Zhang at 145 University of California, San Francisco and Dr. Taixue An at Southern Medical University for 146 helpful discussions. Research related to viral pneumonia and lung inflammation in the authors' 147 laboratories is supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (Scheme of COVID-19 diagnostic process in mainland China. 179 In mainland China, cases with any COVID-19 symptoms and/or a documented contact history 180 with confirmed COVID-19 patients were examined with CT scanning and PCR testing. Cases 181 were then divided into three categories based on findings in lung imaging. Signs of pneumonia 182 in imaging and a positive PCR test result were used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19. Cases 183 that had contact history and typical signs of pneumonia in imaging, but had negative PCR test 184 results, were clinically diagnosed as COVID-19, followed by retesting with PCR and antibody 185 assays. Before February 11 th , 2020, asymptomatic cases were reported as COVID-19 in 186 mainland China. In early February, the 4th edition of \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for 187 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\" was released in mainland China, and recommended reporting 188 SARS-CoV-2 infection in two categories: (1) \"COVID-19\" (cases with confirmed infection and 189 disease symptoms); and (2) asymptomatic infection. Any symptoms including discomforts 190 reported by patients, disease parameters measured by doctors (eg.: high body temperature and 191 low fingertip oximeter reading), and signs of pneumonia in CT images, will define a case as 192 symptomatic. The current reported COVID-19 cases in mainland China include all cases of 193 COVID-19 (infection + symptoms) and asymptomatic cases (never had symptoms) of SARS-194CoV-2 infection determined before Feb 11 th , st , 2020: 81,554 reported cases of COVID-",
