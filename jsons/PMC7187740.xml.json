It is postulated that this may lead to unopposed angiotensin II activity and renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone-system (RAAS) activation, leading to neutrophil infiltration into the lungs and lung injury.(6)",

ACE 2 may also attenuate inflammation through the activation of nitric oxide pathways. In some experimental studies with animal models, it has been shown that there is increased expression and activity of ACE 2 in the heart and brain after treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.(7) Furthermore, the upregulation of ACE 2 in humans is supported by recent evidence showing an increased secretion of ACE 2 in the urine of hypertensive patients treated with olmesartan, an ARB.(8)",

Interestingly, ACE 2 and angiotensin 1\u20137 may in fact have a salutatory role in the lungs since it has been found to be protective in a number of lung injury models. In a mouse model with acid lung injury, ACE 2 downregulation induced by SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the SARS virus outbreak in 2003, worsened lung injury, but this lung injury was improved by therapy with an ARB.(9) These findings suggest that SARS-CoV may induce lung injury, but the injury can be ameliorated by ARB administration.(9) These preclinical findings suggest a possible protective role of ARB in SARS-CoV-associated lung injury and lend credence to the hypothesis that primary activation of the RAAS in cardiovascular patients, rather than its inhibition, renders them more prone to a deleterious outcome. However, currently there is no clinical evidence that has proven that ACE inhibitors or ARB-induced ACE 2 activity is an effective therapy for COVID-19-induced lung injury. In addition, ACE 2 activity may not correlate with the degree of severity of infection with COVID-19 infection. Although ACE 2 is presumed to be an important mediator for SARS-CoV infection, the absence of SARS-CoV has been found in some cell types expressing ACE 2.(10) On the other hand, infection was present in cells apparently lacking ACE 2, suggesting that additional co-factors may be needed for adequate cellular infection.(10)",

            "text": "Because of the connection of the ACE 2 pathway with COVID-19 infection, there has been widespread concern amongst physicians and patients, whether RAAS antagonists such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs confer an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Many patients and their physicians, including those in South Africa, have contemplated a cessation of ACE inhibitors or ARB medications. In the Wuhan study,(2) there was no information of how many of the patients with severe COVID-19 infection were on ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, there are no published studies to date showing that diabetes and hypertension are independent predictors of mortality with COVID-19 infection. Thus, a clear causal relationship between those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and diabetes with chronic kidney disease (DCKD) on ACE inhibitors or ARB treatment and an increased risk of COVID-19 does not exist. There are alternative agents that can be used for the management of hypertension, but DCKD and HFrEF are compelling indications for these drugs. Patients, influenced by the media, may request an alternative anti-hypertensive agent, and that may be appropriate for them, but it is inappropriate to recommend discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARB treatment in patients with HFrEF and DCKD based on a hypothetical adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. Importantly, the indication for which the drugs were originally prescribed may have changed since the drugs were initiated, and a patient with hypertension may not be aware of that they have developed LV systolic dysfunction or that a diabetic has developed proteinuria.",

Thus, age is one of the strongest risk predictors for cardiovascular disease and the effect of ageing on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.(12) A dysregulated immunologic state corresponds with an elevated risk of incident cardiovascular disease and thus other traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia impact immune function.(13) Thus, the presence of cardiovascular disease may be a marker of accelerated immunologic ageing/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis.(12)",

There is extremely strong scientific evidence for the benefit of RAAS inhibition in patients with cardiovascular disease. In patients with HFrEF, RAAS inhibition is a foundation of therapy for these patients. Discontinuation of RAAS inhibition in patients with heart failure can precipitate clinical deterioration and may be associated with increased mortality.(14) Furthermore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are common therapies for hypertension and after myocardial infarction.(15,16) There is significant mortality benefit with all three classes of these agents\u2019 post myocardial infarction. Based on the solid scientific foundation of these three agents in cardiovascular disease, diabetes and renal disease, there is a potential for significant adverse outcomes in discontinuing these agents. COVID-19 appears to be particularly severe in patients with cardiovascular disease and may cause myocarditis, myocardial stress and cardiomyopathy.(12) Thus, discontinuing RAAS inhibition in these high-risk patients can potentially lead to higher mortality.",
