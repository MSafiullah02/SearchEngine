In part this problem is explained by the fact that most of these studies may have simply adopted a qualitative case study research design that is by nature not quantitative. The majority of the studies on tourism crises and disasters appear to be concerned with prevention, planning, response and recovery of such events (see, e.g., Ritchie, 2008, Hall, 2010). The only references in this respect are limited to the definition of the terms crisis and disaster1\nwithout defining a methodology for ex-post detection of these negative events.",

This method has been widely used in different sectors of activity in the determination of structural changes. After that, we compare the date of tourism crises and disasters to the dating of these structural breaks.

First, this method allows us to close a gap in the tourism industry related to the correct allocation of negative shocks in international tourism arrival demand to crisis or disaster phenomena. As stated by Intriligator, Bodkin, and Hsiao (1996: 579) \u201ca break in structure is always a serious matter because it implies that none of the statistical techniques (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc.) is valid any longer. Moreover, the substantive conclusions about the system being modeled that one might wish to draw are also vitiated, to a greater or smaller extent\u201d. Thus, we should be careful in interpreting the results of studies using international tourism demand data that did not take into account these structural breaks, to the extent that their results can be biased. Second, this method can be an important tool for monitoring the impact of a crisis event on the performance of the sector and to provide useful information to develop adequate policy responses to governments, destination managers and hotel managers. A crisis event that causes a structural break should require a specific policy and a greater allocation of resources by policymakers'.2\n",

Scott and Laws (2005: 152) present a table with different definitions of the terms crisis and disaster. We present three of these definitions. Reilly (1993) defines crisis as \u201ca situation which is harmful and disruptive, of high magnitude and is outside the firm's typical operating frameworks\u201d. Carter (1991, p. xxiii) defines a disaster as \u201can event, natural or man-made, sudden or progressive, which impacts with such severity that the affected community has to respond by taking exceptional measures\u201d. Finally, the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) (1991) describes a tourism crisis as \u201ca disaster, whether natural or man-made, that has the potential to totally disrupt the tourism industry\u201d. As Faulkner (2001: 137) emphasizes, all these definitions have transformational connotations, with each event having potentially negative outcomes.",

Hall (2010: 403) refers that \u201cany period where international tourism numbers only increase by 2% or less often appears to be described as a crisis for the industry\u201d. We are of the opinion that this is a simplistic definition that may explain the high number of researches on crises in the tourism sector. In fact, the author emphasizes a substantial number of publications that have looked at tourism crises. He reports 103,000 publications whose abstracts refer to crises, tourism crises and different types of crises. However, Brecher (1978) highlights the danger of oversimplification and the importance of recognizing that the crisis can be a complex phenomenon, given the chaotic nature of crises and disasters and the uncertainty that surrounds them. Given that crises and disasters can lead to chaotic situations and complex interrelations between human and natural systems, the comprehension of the relationship between cause and effect and the implications of decisions and actions is a complicated process (Faulkner, 2001). In this sense Brecher (1978) highlights the seven aspects of the crisis that must be analyzed \u2013 source, gravity, complexity, time, communication patterns, outcomes and potential intensity.",

The author states that tourism, as an area of human activity is no less prone to disasters than any other. However, the recovery of this industry from a crisis is far more complicated than for other industries (Cavlek, 2002). A very strong partnership and coordinated work among the government, national tourism organizations, foreign tour operators, local travel organizers, and local hospitality officials are essential, according to Cavlek (2002: 487). Each needs to participate to an important degree in order to secure the fulfilment of several important actions. These include successful rebuilding of the destination image, overcoming any adverse policy resulting from the crisis, short-term restoration and long-term reconstruction of the damaged tourism facilities and infrastructures, effective management of media coverage, reduction of barriers and travel facilitation, and business and consumer regulation support and subsidies (Cavlek, 2002, Steiner et al., 2013).",

The identification of a \u201creal crisis\u201d is often a complex issue for several reasons. Sometimes countries suffer damage caused by a \u201cripple\u201d effect that goes far beyond the destinations and parties directly involved in the incident that may result in a crisis (Cavlek, 2002, p. 481). As shown by Young and Montgomery (1998:4) \u201c\u2026 a crisis has the potential to be detrimental to the marketability of any tourist destination, particularly if it is dramatised and distorted through rumours and the media\u201d. On the other hand, as stated by Faulkner (2001:142), \u201cthe effectiveness with which the tourism industry in a disaster area handles a crisis, and therefore the degree to which it is prepared for it\u201d, could explain why potentially serious crisis events for the industry did not bring about negative results. For this reason, we propose the application of Bai and Perron\u2019s (1998) method to identify structural changes in the international tourism arrival series.3\nThis method also allows us to examine whether the dates defined by the method correspond to crisis or disaster events cited among other authors in Hall (2010) and Ritchie (2008). Given that the BP method determines endogenously the structural break dates that we do not know in practice, it allows us to see which crisis events were truly harmful to the tourism industry, i.e., the real crisis events.",

Second, the method assumes that potential structural breakpoints are unknown and determine endogenously the structural break dates that we do not know in practice. Finally, the BP method is also revealed to be appropriate for small samples (see Jones & Olken, 2008).",

As is pointed out by Pesaran and Timmermann (2004), the majority of time series are subject to occasional structural breaks and it can be very costly to ignore breaks because the results will be biased and forecasts inconsistent. Given that the majority of researches using international tourism arrival data do not analyze the existence of breaks in tourism demand series, the quality of the results is not guaranteed, neither is the correct identification of crisis and disaster phenomena in the tourism sector. In this sense, the BP method is used by us in this study in order to analyze the linkage between structural changes and crisis and disaster phenomena in the tourism sector.

The m-partition, (T\n1, \u2026, T\nm), represents the breakpoints for the different regimes (by convention, T\n0 = 0 and T\nm+1 = T). We can identify multiple structural changes in the following manner: For each m-partition, (T\n1, \u2026,T\nm) the least-squares estimates of \u03b2\nj are obtained by minimizing the sum of squared residuals,(2)ST(T1,\u2026,Tm)=\u2211j=1m+1\u2211t=Tj\u22121+1Tj(yt\u2212\u03b2j)2where, S\nT represents the sum of squared residuals in m-partition. Being the regression coefficient estimates based on a given m-partition, (T\n1, \u2026,T\nm) be denoted by \u03b2\u02c6({T1,\u2026,Tm}), where \u03b2=(\u03b21,\u2026,\u03b2m+1)'. Next, substituting these into Equation (2), gives the estimated break points(3)(T\u02c61,\u2026,T\u02c6m)=argminT1,\u2026,TMST(T1,\u2026,Tm),where ST(T1,\u2026,Tm) denotes the sum of squared residuals. After estimating the breakpoint, it is straightforward to compute the corresponding least-squares regression parameter estimates as \u03b2\u02c6=\u03b2\u02c6({T1\u02c6,\u2026,Tm\u02c6}. Bai and Perron (2006) developed an efficient algorithm for the minimization problem in Equation (3) based on the principle of dynamic programming.",

According to the authors, the procedure to determine the existence of structural changes and to identify the number of breaks is as follows. First, let SupFT(m) indicate the F-statistic for testing the null hypothesis of no structural breaks against the alternative hypothesis that there are m = b breaks, which are selected according to (3). Second, let UDmax=max1\u2264m\u2264MSupFT(m) and UDmax=max1\u2264m\u2264MWmSupFT(m) denote the two \u201cdouble maximum\u201d statistics, to test the null hypothesis of no structural breaks against the alternative hypothesis of an unknown number of breaks given an upper bound, M. Third, let SupF\nT\n(m + 1\u2216m) denote the F-statistic to test the null hypothesis of m breaks against the alternative hypothesis of m+1 breaks. Fourth, see the UD max or WD max tests to know if at least one break is present. Finally, see the sequential SupF\nT\n(m + 1\u2216m) statistics and define the number of breaks at the 5% level.",

Our results also show that the tsunami of 26 December 2004 in the Indian Ocean had a negative effect on the tourism industry of the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia. In this latter country the Bali bombings have also contributed to poor performance of the tourism sector. The structural breaks identified in 2005 are in line with the devastation of the tourism industry verified in these countries, as is indicated by Sharpley (2005). Finally, we detected the existence of three more structural breaks - in 2007 and 2008 in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka and in 2011 in Japan. In the latter case, we believe that structural change is due to the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear accident that had occurred consecutively in Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011 (in this regard see, e.g., Kim & Park, 2016). The breaks identified in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka in 2007 and 2008, were probably due to the impact of financial and economic crisis. Song and Lin (2010) argue that financial and economic crisis have a negative impact on both inbound and outbound tourism in Asia.",

In the case of Haiti, the earthquake of January 2010 caused heavy damage to the tourism sector, so the structural break identified in 2010 was to be expected. In the case of New Zealand, the earthquake of February 2011 caused damage mainly around Christchurch and we have not identified any structural break in the international tourism arrival series. As stated by Brecher (1978), the gravity and potential intensity are two important factors for the beginning of a crisis that probably not have occurred in the case of New Zealand. The same idea is present in the two structural breaks identified in Madeira. In both cases, natural disasters are at their source. As noted by Machado (2012), the \u201cIsland of Madeira was not prepared for a catastrophe such as the one that occurred in February 2010, and its consequence has been a huge drop in the tourism industry\u201d. Finally, we identify four structural breaks for Mexico, the UK and the USA. The structural break that we find in Mexico is due to the AH1N1 influenza outbreak that has occurred in the country in 2009. As underlined by Speakman and Sharpley (2012: 72), soon as the \u201csituation dominate the world's media, international visitor numbers to Mexico decreased rapidly with the news of the influenza outbreak\u201d. In the case of the UK the structural break identified is related to the foot and mouth disease, which was studied by, among others, Baxter and Bowen (2004). The two structural breaks identified for the US are related to the 9/11 attacks and the financial crisis. The negative impact of the 9/11 attacks on US tourism and air travel is highlighted by Goodrich (2002) and Blunk, Clark, and McGibany (2006). The recent economic and financial crisis seems to explain the structural break in 2009, as stated by Ritchie, Molinar, and Frechtling (2010).",

The first limitation is related to the fact that different crises may occur simultaneously in a given country or region.

This is an extremely important point and has been one of the highlights of the current review of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) Regulation that provides financial support to a Member State in the event of a major natural disaster.8\nThe recommendations for improving the EUSF include (i) budgetary discipline; (ii) reduction of the time taken to provide aid and (iii) a greater clarity as regards scope and definitions. The authors of the document consider that the time currently taken to mobilise the fund is unacceptably long, introducing the possibility of paying advances as soon as the affected state has applied for assistance and the aid would have to be returned to the Union budget in the event that the application was not accepted. For this purpose, it is necessary to define clearly and simply what a disaster is. Given that in developed countries it is possible to incorporate forecasts in international tourism demand series based on travel and accommodation booking requests, it may be possible to detect structural breaks in a short period of time. In the presence of a tourism crisis, the cancellation of travel and hotel reservations often occurs, a situation that tends to be rapidly incorporated into the estimates made for the series analyzed and captured by the BP method. In the short time that elapsed between the occurrence of the crisis and its detection by the BP method, the mechanism of pay advances mentioned above can be used.",
