Epidemiological data demonstrated person-to-person spread is the main mode of transmission, which resulted in a worldwide outbreak [2,3]. World Health Organization (WHO) designated COVID-19 as the official name [4,5]. The pathogen was confirmed to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus [5]. Standard technique to confirm COVID-19 is nucleic acid testing with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or next-gen sequencing (NGS) methods [6,7]. Imaging features differ in different individuals and stages of the COVID-19 pneumonia, and they are also different from other infectious pulmonary diseases [8]. In order to improve the diagnosis and treatment, we first drew up the \u201cGuideline for medical imaging in auxiliary diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019\u201dand participant in \u201cRadiological diagnosis of new coronavirus infected pneumonitis: Expert recommendation from the Chinese Society of Radiology (First edition)\u201d [[9], [10]].Based on these previous advices, this current overview and consensus statement is meant to inform radiologists in the rest of the world based on the Chinese experience.",

Alveolar septal vascular congestion and edema, monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration, and intravascular thrombosis can be seen. Focal hemorrhage and necrosis of lung tissue may occur with hemorrhagic infarction. Intra-alveolar fibrosis, resulting from organization of inflammatory exudates also can be found. The epithelium of the bronchial mucosa in lungs discards, and there is formation of mucus and mucus plugs in the cavity. Coronavirus particles can be seen in the bronchial mucosal epithelium and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells under an electron microscope [[11], [12]].",

Nasal congestion, sore throat, and diarrhea are atypical clinical presentations [13]. Patients with mild or moderate type only demonstrate a low fever and mild fatigue without pneumonia in the early stage of the disease [13,14]. Most patients have a good prognosis, with few patients becoming critically ill. Prognosis is poor for the elderly and those with chronic underlying diseases, and the symptoms of children tend to be relatively mild [15,16]. Some critically patients may have elevation of troponin level, and an increase of C-reactive protein can be seen. Critically ill patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock with metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction that are difficult to correct [16,17]. For the clinical criteria, the first step is to ascertain the epidemiology history of suspected cases. Confirmed cases must be tested positive by RT-CPR assay or by NGS [18]. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, or other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, and stools [19].",

Due to various factors such as specimen collection technology, kit quality, and the diversity of disease evolution, the false-negative rate of nucleic acid detection is relatively high in China. In the situation of suspected crowds and limited medical resources, nucleic acid test negative but CT positive (highly suggestive of viral pneumonia) are also listed as medical isolation treatment criteria in China, which is more in line with the actual situation in Wuhan [18,9]. Thus, infection prevention and control is a new task and a serious challenge facing the radiology department in China. All members must fully understand the epidemic situation and fully grasp the knowledge of infection control. The work process and working mode must be changed in accordance with the requirements. The radiology department should prepare the requirements of COVID-19 imaging examination workflows, including but not limited to: (1) set up a special waiting area and examination room for COVID-19 patients; (2) require all radiologists, technologists, and nurses to master skills of prevention of COVID-19 infection; (3) formulate emergency CT examination specifications, procedures and disinfection measures for patients with suspected COVID-19; (4) require self-protection measures for all radiologists, technologists, and nurses; (7) regulate disposal of waste protective equipment. It should be emphasized that in order to prevent cross-infection, hospitals should clearly divide the polluted area, semi-polluted area, and clean area according to the requirements of nosocomial infection control, and set up independent inspection areas.",

However, the sensitivity and specificity for mild type patients are relatively low [27]. It is not recommended for patients with early COVID-19 stage. Chest CT scans can demonstrate almost all abnormalities including early mild exudative lesions. Chest CT is the most valuable imaging tool for the clinical diagnosis of early stage COVID-19 pneumonia when patients\u2019 symptoms are aspecific, especially in Wuhan with insufficient PCR tests in the early pandemic period [28,29]. It is recommended to use volume CT with a maximum acquisition slice thickness of 5 mm (\u226516 slice multi-detector CT) and a reconstruction slice thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm [30]. Multi-planar reformats (transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes) are beneficial for the early detection of lesions in patients with negative nucleic acid tests [9].",

Corresponding pathological changes are exudation in the alveolar cavity with partial filling of the air cavity, mainly from serous and fibrinous exudates, alveolar septal vascular congestion and edema. Disease progression mostly occurs in a course of 7-10 days, with enlarged and increased density of GGO, and consolidated lesions with air bronchogram sign [9,34,35]. GGOs from the early stage expand, and the density increases gradually. Consolidation shows increased lung parenchymal density, and blurred borders of the pulmonary blood vessels and airway walls due to the loss of air contrast. The lesion range can be acinar, leaflet, lung segment or lung lobe. Lesions are distributed as bilateral asymmetrical subpleural wedge-shaped or fan-shaped, mostly in the caudal regions of the lung and dorsal subpleural area [36]. When interlobular septa and intralobular interstitium are thickened, this is displayed as subpleural reticulation according to a \"crazy paving\" pattern [[38], [39], [40]]. The underlying pathological changes are pulmonary edema, protein exudation, thickening of intralobular interstitial, and multinucleated giant cells and macrophage infiltration in the alveolar cavity [37]. Critical stage disease may show further expansion of consolidations, with the whole lung showing increased opacity, a so-called \"white lung\" [9,35]. In recovery stage patients, the lesion area is reduced and absorbed, or only residual fibrous lesions are seen [38]. Less common findings include pleural effusion, stretch bronchiectasis, and thoracic lymphadenopathy (Imaging examples are shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5\n).",

[34] evaluated each of the five lung lobes and determined the degree of involvement and rated the severity of each lobe. The patients who had the highest score (of 19) were admitted to the intensive care unit with multiple bilateral GGOs and subsegmental consolidation. Pan et al. [28] investigated the time course of lung changes during recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. The results showed that with the evolution of the disease, GGO would enlarge with a crazy paving pattern and partial consolidation. Lung involvement reached a maximum at about the 10th day after the onset, and the crazy-paving pattern was resolved entirely in the absorption stage about the 14th day after the disease onset, which means that the crazy-paving pattern may become an important indicator for evaluation of disease evolution. Other studies focusing on the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia concluded that the lung segments showed marked changes with decreasing of GGOs and increasing of crazy-paving pattern and consolidation [9,[39], [40], [41], [42]]. Patients recovering from COVID-19 can be tracked with CT to assess for long-term or permanent lung damage, including fibrosis. (Imaging examples are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7\n).",

In a study comparing chest CT from 219 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in China and 205 patients with other causes of viral pneumonia in the United States, COVID-19 pneumonia cases were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80 versus 57 percent), and GGO (91 versus 68 percent) [8].

Thus, rapid detection, accurate location of lesions, and evaluation of lesion size, properties, and lesion dynamics are urgent issues that need to be addressed. An AI-assisted diagnostic system for COVID-19 has been developed in China. It takes about 15 seconds with an accuracy rate above 90% [49]. The AI-system has outstanding performance in the detection of subtle GGO, which is the most easily missed typical CT feature of COVID-19. Also, it can precisely segment the lesion region, calculate the lesion volume, volume rates of lesions to total/left/right lung, and each lung lobe. Comparing CT scans of the same patient at several time points, the radiologist can use the system to measure changes in each lesion and track the progression of the disease (Fig. 8\n). Some researchers have tried to apply AI in CT image analysis to differentiate COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia patients [50]. With clinical symptoms, laboratory testing results, and contact or travel history, the AI system can help doctors identify patients with risk of progressing to a more severe disease state at the time of admission, for timely, precise, and effective treatment decisions. Hence, precise lesion labeling, segmentation, and quantification analysis of COVID-19 lesions is the future of AI.",
