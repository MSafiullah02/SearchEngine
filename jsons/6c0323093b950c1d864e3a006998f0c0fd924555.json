Although modelling can be helpful, widespread and rapid dissemination in our hyperconnected world, as was seen with CoVID-19, creates real-time challenges for these analyses. As of 4 March 2020, CoVID-19 had spread worldwide with remarkable speed and large foci had developed outside China, in Italy, South Korea, Iran, Japan, as well as on the Diamond princess Cruise Ship In terms of clinical epidemiology, there is no particular set of signs or symptoms that can reliably discriminate CoVID-19 from other respiratory viral illnesses, including influenza. the median incubation period is currently estimated to be 4-6 days (range [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] with most people recovering spontaneously with the help of supportive care.

            "text": "In terms age distribution of persons affected by CoVID-19, data from the largest China surveillance report to date shows that most of them are middle-aged adults [8] . More recent data suggest that children are as equally susceptible to C0VID-19 as adults [9] , but Chinese paediatric cases were probably under reported because of milder symptoms than adults and therefore decreased likelihood of children presenting for clinical care or if they had come to care they may not have been recognised as having CoVID-19 [8] . Adults aged >60 years experience a more severe CoVID-19 illness and are more likely to die, as reflected by case fatality rates (Cfr) [8] . A number of factors can affect the Cfr, such as the geographical location, local healthcare systems, group of persons affected by CoVID-19, number of people tested and the efficiency of diagnosis and management of CoVID-19. the most seriously ill people with the highest risk of death tend to be tested first in disease outbreaks. As more persons with less severe disease are tested, the increasing number of cases diagnosed include more survivors and therefore the Cfr decreases. the number of deaths depends on how quickly an illness is recognised and the quality of its management, and increases when there is insufficient life-sustaining supportive care. All things considered, the CDC's current best estimate of CoVID-19 Cfr lies between 0.5 and 3.5% as compared with seasonal influenza of about 0.1%, suggesting that it might be 5-35 times more deadly. However, the presenter stated that most CoVID-19 illnesses tended to be mild and generally patients recovered spontaneously with some level of supportive care, especially children and middle-aged adults. respiratory secretions are the main mode of CoVID-19 transmission through respiratory droplets. transmission from people who are pre-symptomatic or have asymptomatic infection is possible, but its contribution to the overall number of infections appears to be small at this time. the amount of viral shedding from the respiratory tract is greatest at the time of symptoms and then declines. High-risk groups include people with medical comorbidities and older people, who are at increased risk for severe illness and death (Cfr>5%, with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or chronic respiratory disease). no data are yet available for people who are immunocompromised due to medical treatment, or people living with HIV. pregnancy data seem reassuring with a similar mortality rate between women with and without CoVID-19. [10] . these age and comorbidity statistics were provided by two sources: report of the WHo-China Joint Mission published on 28 february by the World Health organization (WHo) [11] , which is based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases and an article by the Chinese CDC released on 17 february 2020, which is based on 72,314 confirmed, suspected, and asymptomatic cases of CoVID-19 in China as of 11 february 2020 and was published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology [8] . It is crucial to know that the WHo-China report notes that 'The Joint Mission acknowledges the known challenges and biases of reporting crude CFR early in an epidemic' [11] .",

Dr Wu highlighted that, as SArS-CoV-2 is a new virus, we do not have pre-existing immunity, treatment or a prophylactic vaccine to control it. According to the presenter, China has implemented strong public health measures in order to confront this new epidemic.",

A national Institute of Health Clinical trial of remdesivir is about to start. Vaccine platform technologies are also in development, especially using an mrnA vaccine candidate expressing the CoVID-19 viral spike protein (nIAID Vaccine research Center collaborating with Modern and the Coalition for epidemic preparedness Innovations, CepI).",
