They serve as reservoirs for a number of human zoonotic diseases. In this study, a porcine astrovirus (PAstV) strain, designated as PAstV JWH-1, is identified from a diarrheal pig in China, and it is partially characterized genetically. Sequence analysis shows that the PAstV JWH-1 strain contains divergent nucleotide sequences in both the open reading frame (ORF)1b/ORF2 consensus and the 3 0 -UTR regions (s2m motif), which are usually highly conserved among members of the family Astroviridae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the JWH-1 strain clusters closely with newly identified strains PAstV 12-4 and 14-4 and forms a group of mamastroviruses with the proposed novel deer astrovirus. Further recombination analysis shows that two possible interspecies recombination events between porcine and deer astroviruses occurred in the genome of the JWH-1 strain. This study further confirms that multiple lineages are present among PAstVs, and each lineage likely represents an independent origin. Additionally, the possibility of interspecies transmission among PAstVs is also suggested.",

Six proposed novel AstV species, including deer, rat, dog, sea lion, bottlenose dolphin, and bat astroviruses, have recently been identified [4, 5, 20, 22, 23] .

PAstV was identified and isolated in 1980 [1] and 1990 [21] , respectively, but the first molecular characterization of PAstV was not reported until 2001 [11] . Then, a closely related strain was also isolated from a pig diarrheal sample and successfully propagated in vitro in 2006 [9] .

The aim of the study was to characterize picobirnaviruses (PBVs) in diarrheal porcine fecal specimens using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [2] . However, an unexpected band was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis when the full-length sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of one porcine PBV strain was determined using the genome-walking PCR method. The genome walking PCR method is a useful method to obtain unknown sequences on either side of the known nucleotide sequence. We used it to determine the unknown sequences on either side of the RdRp gene of one porcine PBV strain. The whole process was performed using the commercial genome walking kit (Takara, Japan) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, three specific forward or reverse primers were designed based on the sequence of the amplified fragment obtained from detection PCR, and a thermally asymmetric PCR reaction was done using the four degenerate primers of low annealing temperature provided in the kit. Generally, at least one of the degenerate primers can be matched with specific primers, and the flanking sequences of a known sequence can be obtained by three nested PCR reactions. If one genome-walking PCR did not achieve the required length, we were able to obtain the flanking sequence by a subsequent round of genome-walking PCR based on the sequence information from the previous round.",

A highly conserved sequence, UUUGGAGNGGNGGACCN AAN 5-8 AUGNC, where the ORF2 AUG start codon is underlined and N stands for any of the four nucleotides, was located at the junction between ORF1b and ORF2. This sequence was proposed to be a regulatory element that serves as a promoter for subgenomic RNA transcription. The sequence has been found in members of different species of astrovirus [16] . Alignment of the corresponding region from all strains shown in Fig. 1 that were characterized in the present study revealed that this motif was conserved in all strains. Compared with other PAstV strains, PAstV JWH-1, PAstV 12-4, PAstV 14-4 and PoAstV Hungary contain a unique insertion of three nucleotides upstream of the ORF2 initiation codon (Fig. 1b) . The function of this difference is unclear and needs further confirmation. The putative ORF2 contains 2313 nt that encode a 770-aa capsid protein, which is close to the average length of the mamastrovirus capsid proteins. The complete ORF 2 of JWH-1 shared the highest nucleotide identity (70.3%) and amino acid identity (70%) with that of the PAstV 12-4 strain. The 3 0 -UTR measured 73 nt, excluding the poly (A) tract. All human astrovirus strains except strain MLB contain a conserved stem-loop-II-like motif (s2m) in the 3 0 -end of the genomic RNA [10] . The exact role of this motif is unclear, but due to its presence in members of many viral families such as picornaviruses and coronaviruses, this motif has been suggested to have an important function in viral RNA replication [11] . However, the s2m motif was not found in the PAstV JWH-1 strain. Alignment of the corresponding region from the eight representative PAstV strains characterized in the present study (Fig. 1c) revealed that the strains PAstV Japan, PAstV Tokushiman, PAstV 16-2, and PAstV 12-3 contain a conserved s2m motif, whereas the corresponding sequence has not been found in strains PAstV JWH-1, PAstV 12-4, PAstV 14-4, and PAstV Hungary.",

They formed a subgroup that was divergent from the prototypical PAstVs and formed a novel group within the genus Mamastrovirus, together with the proposed new deer astrovirus. As shown in the phylogenetic tree, the existing PAstVs were distributed in several clades and were distributed in different species. Some strains were related to HAstVs, whereas some strains were only closely related to PAstVs, and the other strains were more closely related to strains infecting other animals, such as sea lions, mink and sheep. These results suggest that multiple lineages exist among porcine astroviruses, and each lineage is likely to represent an independent origin.",

Sequences were first aligned in the Clustal W program, and the SimPlot program was used to analyze similarities and to locate potential recombinant sequences. If the results were supportive of the presence of a recombination site, the RDP 4 program was employed to identify all possible recombination events. A similarity plot (Fig. 3) shows that the JWH-1 strain has a high degree of identity to the PoAstV Hungary strain at the beginning of the ORF 1b region, whereas it has a high degree of identity with PAstV 12-4, c Nucleotide sequence alignment of the conserved sequence motif at the 3 0 ends of the JWH-1 strain with those of prototypical PAstVs. The ORF2 stop codon is indicated by asterisks. The stem-loop-II-like motif (s2m) is indicated by a red frame PAstV 14-4 and deer astrovirus strains at the end of the ORF 1b region and in the ORF2 region. Further analysis of these highly similar sequences using the RDP4 program showed that there are two possible sites of recombination events in the JWH-1 strain, with a high degree of confidence (p B 1.426 9 10 -4 ). Based on a bootscan plot (Fig. 4) , one recombination event occurred between the PoAstV Hungary strain and the Deer-CcAstV-2 strain (Fig. 4a) , and another occurred between the PoAstV 14-4 strain and the Deer-CcAstV-2 strain (Fig. 4b) , which led to the recombinant JWH-1 strain. To confirm the results, phylogenetic trees based on the recombinant regions and non-recombinant regions of the parental strains for each recombination event were constructed using MEGA4 (Fig. 4) . The discrepancies between the phylogenetic trees provide direct evidence of recombination. The results described above indicate that recombination events have occurred within the genome of the JWH-1 strain. In recent studies, novel astroviruses have been identified in species of many marine mammals, indicating that astroviruses have a wide range of host species [20] . Likewise, a number of genetically distinct strains of PAstV were recently identified and characterized. In the present study, we detected and characterized a PAstV strain in China. The PAstV strain was accidentally detected when the fulllength RdRp gene of one porcine PBV strain was determined using the genome-walking method. The forward primer was a random primer from the commercial genomewalking kit, which was randomly combined with the sequence. The reverse primer was a specific primer that was designed for the RdRp region of PBV. Further comparison of the reverse primer and the PoAstV sequence in this study revealed that there is an 11-base-pair-long region of identity between the PoAstV sequence and the 3 0 end of the primer sequence. We speculate that this identical motif, coupled with the randomness of the forward primer, led to the detection of the PAstV strain.",
