Thirtyseven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), \u22652 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1. 1-7.8) , systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7). TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2). Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract affecting millions of people worldwide. [5] [6] [7] Patients with IBD and related rheumatologic, dermatologic, and neurologic autoinflammatory conditions frequently require treatment with immunosuppressant medications which can increase the risk of infection. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines, methotrexate), biologics, and janus-kinase inhibitors, commonly used to treat chronic autoinflammatory conditions, have been associated with higher rates of serious viral and bacterial infections including influenza and pneumonia. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Yet, it is also possible that some forms of immune suppression may blunt the excessive immune response/cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 infection and consequently reduce mortality, as suggested by emerging case reports of anti-IL-6 therapy. 16, 17 Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic auto-inflammatory   diseases such as IBD, particularly those who require systemic immunosuppressant medications. An initial report of COVID-19 among 1,099 patients in China included only two persons with immune deficiency. 18 A subsequent report found that cancer patients had a higher risk of severe COVID-19, but this conclusion was based on only 16 patients. 19 In Italy, Mazza et al reported a case of COVID-19 pneumonia leading to death in a patient with severe acute ulcerative colitis treated with systemic corticosteroids. 20 In order to provide better guidance to patients and their health care providers and to inform strategies for prevention of COVID-19 and medication management, more data are urgently needed regarding the impact of IBD and treatments on COVID-19 outcomes. In the present work, we report on the clinical course of COVID-19 and risk factors for adverse outcomes in a large cohort of patients with IBD collected through an international registry.

In the adjusted analysis of our primary outcome, we observed no association between TNF antagonist use and severe COVID-19. As TNF antagonists are the most commonly prescribed biologic therapy for patients with IBD, these initial findings should be reassuring to the large number of patients receiving TNF antagonist therapy and support their continued use during this current pandemic. In our exploratory subgroup analysis, we observed a higher risk of hospitalization and/or death with TNF antagonist combination therapy versus monotherapy, consistent with prior studies of other infectious complications. 12 Given the overall effect estimate of TNF antagonists (combination and monotherapy combined) in our primary model was 0.9, one can hypothesize that TNF antagonist monotherapy may have a protective effect against severe COVID-19, as suggested in a recent commentary. 27 We observed a higher risk of our primary outcome in patients exposed to 5-ASA/sulfasalazine. This finding persisted after controlling for age, comorbidities, IBD disease characteristics, corticosteroid use, and other factors. Furthermore, in a direct comparison, we observed that 5-ASA/sulfasalazine treated patients fared worse than those treated with TNF inhibitors. Although we cannot exclude unmeasured confounding, further exploration of biological mechanisms is warranted. Conversely, although the number of reported cases exposed to other IBD treatments is currently small, it is worth noting that 51/55 (93%) patients treated with anti-IL12/23 required outpatient care only and none died.",

Although our study sample is diverse in terms of age, geography, race, and other factors, we acknowledge the possibility of reporting bias. Reported cases may over-represent more severe COVID-19 patients who come to the attention of their provider and patients in areas with readily available COVID-19 testing. Conversely, our sample may under-represent those severely ill patients who may be hospitalized at an outside hospital or die without their physician's awareness. The registry includes only confirmed cases of COVID-19 in accordance with other reporting initiatives from national authorities and the World Health Organization, 2, 4, 18 though we recognize many patients with suspected infection are never tested.

ABSTRACT Background and Aims: The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown. We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes.",

For hospitalized patients, the name of hospital, length of stay, need for ICU, and need for a ventilator were additionally recorded. QGIS 3.4.4 (www.osgeo.org) was used to create a choropleth map of the number of reported cases of IBD stratified by four classes using Jenks Natural Breaks. 21 ArcGIS Pro 2.4.1 and ArcGIS Online (www.esri.com/en-us/home) were used to create an interactive global map (https://covidibd.org/map/) that visualizes patients with IBD diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as their clinical course and characteristics.
