The core of unidirectional flow is that the direction of flow is single, the streamlines are comparatively parallel, and the air velocities are relatively uniform. While the implication of unidirectional flow is that the total trend of airflow direction is fixed, which passes from the clean area towards the polluted area or through the clean area ! potentially polluted area ! polluted area. Streamlines are not required to be parallel, and air velocities are not required to be uniform. It is shown that in the flow field of directional flow, local vortex could exist. But the total trend of airflow is fixed, which passes from the clean area (near the position below the air supply outlet) to the polluted area (near the operation table). In the infectious isolation ward for microorganism pollution control, the CDC manual in U.S.A. published in 1994 clearly stated for the required directional flow that the ventilation system should be designed and balanced to force air passed through less polluted area (or relative clean area) to seriously polluted area (or relative unclean area). For example, air should flow from the corridor (relative clean area) to the isolation ward for pulmonary tuberculosis (unclean area), so that pollutant can be prevented from dispersing into other region. By setting relative low pressure in the area where air is supposed to flow into, the direction of airflow can be controlled. Therefore, with the principle of directional flow, the scheme with exhaust air on single side wall is usually adopted.",

According to the research by Shen, Deng and Tang [10, 13, 14] , the ventilation performance with displacement effect for the double shutter is much better than that of other air openings. A certain angle of supplied air can be formed with the double shutter, which could reduce the draft sensation on the surface of patient (refer to the next section). When the angle between the upper louver and the horizontal plane is 60\u00ba and when the angle between the lower louver and the horizontal plane is 40\u00ba, the performance of air distribution is the best. In this case, the air distribution indoors is shown in Fig. 4 .36. The schematic diagram for the dispersion of pollutant indoors from the coughing process of patient is shown in Fig. 4 .37 [10] . From all the figures shown in Sect. 4.3, when the air supply outlet is not above the face of patient, the relationship between the air velocity at the height 0.8 m and the air velocity at the air supply outlet can be obtained, which is shown in Table 4 .7.

Moreover, under the condition of the air change rate 12 h \u22121 (which could corresponds to the air cleanliness level 100,000), the bacterial concentration reached the value within air cleanliness level from 1000 to 10,000.

For sampling points 22-30, the concentration for scheme No. 1 is larger than that for scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) by 25%. Therefore, it is meaningful to adopt scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) in this aspect. As mentioned before, this result has been proved by numerical simulation. It has been mentioned before that it is not important how much is the average indoor concentration, but the concentration in the working area of the medical personnel should be lowest. Therefore, the performance of scheme No. 2-a with one air return opening is superior to that of scheme No. 1, scheme No. 2-b with two air return openings and scheme No. 3.",

The concentration of scheme No. 2-a with one air return opening is larger than the indoor average concentration by two times, which is also larger than that for scheme No. 1 by three times and larger than that for scheme No. 4 by three and four times. This is because these petri dishes were placed on the bed, which is close to the pollutant source. This is understandable. (4) The whole performance measured for scheme No. 4 is superior to that of scheme No. 2-a with one return air opening and scheme 1, while the performances of the latter two schemes are better than other schemes by both measurement and simulation. Based on the simulated result by Weipeng Deng shown in Table 4 .4, the performance for the scheme with one-side top-supply is the best. Therefore, it is easy to combine these findings for understanding purpose. Because of the advantages of these two schemes, they are widely used. (5) As mentioned in Sect. 3.3, the area of the air supply outlet can be enlarged until the air velocity at the air supply outlet is not less than 0.13 m/s.

Given the actual condition occurred in the ward, the patient model was placed on the sickbed (During experiment, the model can stay with recumbent position. Aerosol can be exhaled from the nasal cavity), at each side of the sickbed one medical personnel model was placed.

The relative positions of objects in these schemes are presented in Figs. 4.30, 4.31, 4.32, 4.33 and 4.34. The detailed information of these schemes are: Scheme No. 1: Two air return openings.
