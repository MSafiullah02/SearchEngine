They are also the primary cause of sporadic and epidemic acute gastroenteritis worldwide [4], [5]. The morbidity and mortality associated with norovirus infection impacts disproportionately the elderly, immunocompromised individuals [6] and, in developing countries, children [7]. Combating noroviruses presents a major challenge because noroviruses are highly contagious, genetically diverse, environmentally stable, display prolonged and profuse viral shedding, evolve rapidly, and are capable of spreading in many different ways [8], [9]. There are currently no effective vaccines or norovirus-specific antivirals for norovirus infection. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infection [10], [12], [13].",

It carries a positive sense single stranded RNA genome (7.7 Kb) that consists of three open reading frames (ORF1-3). ORF1 encodes a 200 kDa precursor polyprotein which is processed by a virus-encoded cysteine endopeptidase to generate at least six mature non-structural proteins [14], [15], [16]. Polyprotein processing by norovirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is vital for the replication of the virus, consequently, norovirus 3CLpro has emerged as an attractive target for the discovery and development of antiviral agents against norovirus infections [10], [11], [17].",

The \u03b2-barrel domain accounts for most of the binding interactions involved between a peptide substrate and 3CLpro. A hallmark of norovirus 3CLpro, as well as other related 3C or 3CL viral proteases, is that its primary substrate specificity is dictated by the presence of a P1 glutamine (and less frequently glutamic acid), at the S1 subsite [22]. Furthermore, previous studies involving the mapping of the substrate specificity of 3CLpro have revealed that the protease prefers small hydrophobic amino acids such as a leucine residue at P2 and that the plasticity of its S3 subsite allows the protease to accommodate His, Gln or Glu [16], [18], [19].",

Among these hydrogen bonds, the backbone NH and carbonyl O of the Ala160 residue forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl O and NH of the P3 residue of the inhibitor (Fig. 2\nA). In addition, a third hydrogen bond exists between the backbone O of the Ala158 residue and the backbone NH of the P1 residue of the inhibitor. This hydrogen bonding arrangement resembles the hydrogen bonding pattern found in antiparallel \u03b2-sheets and serves to correctly orient and position the inhibitor (or substrate) backbone to the active site. The hydrogen bonding associated with an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet is more feasible when an inhibitor (or substrate) binds to the active site of a protease in a \u03b2-strand conformation, the extended \u201csaw tooth\u201d conformation of a peptide (\u03d5 = \u2212120 \u00b1 200 and \u03c8 = +120 \u00b1 200) where the backbone NHs are exposed to the environment [27]. As a consequence, the aforementioned binding mode permits proteases to universally recognize their ligands in the \u03b2-strand conformation [25], [26].",

Macrocyclization of linear peptidyl inhibitors was accomplished by tethering the P1 and P3 residues of the linear inhibitor by a suitable linker, thereby pre-organizing the macrocycle in a \u03b2-strand conformation prior to binding to the enzyme active site (Fig. 2B) [27], [28]. This approach results in the formation of a pre-organized and semi-rigid entity that displays the amino acid side chains in a well-defined vector relationship for optimal binding and enhances the affinity of the inhibitor to the target enzyme by minimizing the entropy loss upon binding. Additional potential advantages of macrocyclic inhibitors include high stability to metabolizing enzymes, high selectivity and, frequently, increased cellular permeability [29], [30], [31], [32]. We describe herein the structure-based design of macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro where the side chain of the P1 Gln primary substrate specificity residue is tethered to the P3 residue via a triazole linker to yield macrocycles (I) (Fig. 1) and explore the effect of ring size on conformation and its impact on pharmacological activity using high field NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies. We also report the first examples of macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro that are cellurarly permeable.",

Specifically, the synthesis of macrocycles 2\u20133 entailed click chemistry-mediated macrocyclization using intermediates 15a\u2013c and 20a\u2013b (Scheme 2\n), while compounds 1 and 4\u201311 were obtained through macrolactamization starting with key intermediates 15a\u2013c and 19a\u2013e (Scheme 3\n). In general, the macrolactamization methodology was found to be superior, particularly in terms of ease of purification of the resultant cyclized products. Intermediates 15a and 20a\u2013b were coupled in the presence of EDCI and HOBt to yield the corresponding linear precursors 24a and 24b of the macrocyclic esters 25a and 25b. Intramolecular click reactions of the linear precursors 24a\u2013b were carried out using a CuI/DBU mixture in dichloromethane under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 24 h to provide macrocyclic esters 25a\u2013b in fairly good yields (45\u201350%). Intermediates 15a\u2013c and 19a\u2013e were coupled using intermolecular click reaction in the presence of CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate in THF/H2O solution to obtain the corresponding linear precursors 27a\u2013i of macrocyclic esters 28a\u2013i. Macrolactamization of compounds 27a\u2013i was carried out using EDCI and HOBt in DMF at room temperature for 24 h to yield macrocyclic esters 28a\u2013i in good yields (\u223c60%). In both cyclization methods, the dilution factor of the reaction mixture was critical in controlling the intramolecular cyclization reaction over the intermolecular reaction. Reduction of macrocyclic esters using LiBH4 followed by Dess\u2013Martin periodinane oxidation provided the corresponding macrocyclic aldehydes 1\u201311 in fairly good yields (\u223c50%).",

As dictated by the primary substrate specificity of norovirus 3CLpro, the P1 Gln residue remained invariant in all synthesized inhibitors. Furthermore, norovirus 3CLpro prefers a P2 Leu or Cha [12], (a), consequently, the convergent nature of the synthetic plan allowed for variations in the P2 residue via the judicious selection of appropriate natural or unnatural amino acid esters, thereby permitting the targeting of related viral proteases in the and Coronaviridae families.",

The electron density maps for the three bound inhibitors are shown in Fig. 4\nA\u2013C. As expected, the backbones of all three inhibitors are structurally more rigid compared to the atoms forming the macrocyclic linker, which is more flexible. This is evident from an analysis of the B-factors for the inhibitors in each structure, which are slightly lower in the backbone region as shown in the right panels of Fig. 4A\u2013C. The electron density for the \u201ccap\u201d phenyl ring was not observed for 1 and 3 due to disorder and could not be modeled, while inhibitor 10 has somewhat weak electron density that permitted modeling of the phenyl ring. The triazole ring of inhibitor 3 has reasonable electron density, however, it is more disordered and its exact orientation is not clearly discernible (Fig. 4).",

The observed degree of inhibition prompted us to delineate the structural determinants associated with binding in order to gain insight and understanding into the relative potency of the inhibitors. Toward that end, superposition with GESAMT [33] of the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the NV 3CLpro:10 complex (largest ring size) with the NV 3CLPro:1 complex (smallest ring size) shows that the enzyme structures in both complexes are similar, with an RMSD between C\u03b1 atoms of 0.76 \u00c5 (167 residues), except for the flexible loop spanning Lys121 to Glu140 (Fig. 5\nA). The binding of inhibitor 10 (larger ring size) to the active site is accompanied by the movement of the flexible loop away from the inhibitor resulting in the loss of a hydrogen bond between the P1 side chain (Gln C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO) of the inhibitor with Thr134 (backbone NH) which forms the S1 pocket. His157, which is the other constituent of the S1 pocket but is not a part of the flexible loop, maintains a hydrogen bond interaction with the P1 Gln CO (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that the interaction of NV 3CLpro with acyclic dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl inhibitors involves the formation of two crucial hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of the glutamine surrogate CO in the inhibitor and the Thr134 and His157 residues [12]. These two hydrogen bonding interactions, as well as the flexible backbone of the T123-G133 loop [34], appear to play a critical role in enzyme-substrate recognition and are conserved in all norovirus proteases. Thus, in the NV 3CLpro:1 complex, the movement of the flexible loop and the shorter linker length of the inhibitor which positions the carbonyl oxygen of the P1 Gln side chain away from His157 and Thr134, results in the loss of the Thr134 P1 Gln CO hydrogen bond (Fig. 5C). Conversely, the binding of inhibitor 1 allows the flexible loop to move closer to the inhibitor such that a contact can be formed (3.3 \u00c5) between Pro136 and the carbonyl oxygen of the warhead (Fig. 5B).",

On the other hand, as mentioned above, the compact, rigid ring structure and the additional hydrogen bond with Ala160, discernible from the X-ray crystal structure, may account for the 4-fold decrease in the IC50 value (1.6 \u03bcM) of compound 1 as compared to compound 10. The in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds 1 and 3 which form the same number of direct hydrogen bonds with the enzyme (7 hydrogen bonds) was found to be 1.6 \u03bcM and 2.4 \u03bcM, respectively. Interestingly, compound 34, the acyclic variant of compound 3, was devoid of any inhibitory activity.

            "text": "In order to gain further insight into the solution conformation and binding of the synthesized macrocyclic inhibitors, as well as confirm the absence of alternate structures, NMR studies were carried out using the precursor cyclic esters. Assignment of the proton resonances was done using 1H, COSY, ROESY and HMBC spectral details. The ROESY spectra of the compounds show Hi\u03b1 to NH (i + 1) type correlation, where the Gln and Leu NH show correlation to the Leu H\u03b1 and carbamate H\u03b1, respectively (see Figs. S1\u2013S5 in Supporting information). This observation is indicative of a prearranged structure within the macrocycle [28]. The temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts experiments were performed using compounds 28a (ring size: 17), 28e (ring size: 20) and 28g (ring size: 21), revealing important information about the solution structures of the macrocycles. Solvent shielded NH protons typically have \u0394\u03b4/T values less than 4 ppb/K while solvent exposed NH protons have \u0394\u03b4/T values greater than 4 ppb/K [28]. According to the results, the Gln, Leu, and propargylglycine NH protons have \u0394\u03b4/T values greater than 4 ppb/K in all cases (Table 3\n). At larger ring sizes, the carbamate NH shows a higher temperature dependence (\u22127.0 and 6.4 ppb/K for ring sizes 20 and 21, respectively), indicating greater solvent exposure. However, for smaller ring size it shows comparatively low temperature dependence (4.2 ppb/K at 17 ring size), indicating less solvent exposure. This is further supported by the observed line broadening of the carbamate NH proton at elevated temperatures for compounds 28e and 28g, and the lower line broadening observed for 28a (Fig. S6 in Supporting information). Previous studies have shown that amide signals exchanging with water impurity present in DMSO solvent show considerable broadening of the line width at elevated temperatures due to the enhanced exchange rate at higher temperatures [28]. At smaller ring size, all three NH protons show less temperature dependence, indicating solvent shielding which is partly due to the compact nature of the compound. The absence of very low temperature dependent NH protons (\u223c2 ppb/K) would appear to rule out the presence of alternative turn structures, such as \u03b3-turns. Finally, the conformations of the peptide backbone of macrocycles 28a and 28h were determined based on 1D 3\nJ\nNH-CH\u03b1 coupling constants (Table 4\n). The coupling constant 3\nJ\nNH-CH\u03b1 correlates with the dihedral angle (\u03c8) according to the Karplus equation [28]. For unstructured random coil conformations the coupling constant is around 7 Hz while unusually high coupling constants (>9 Hz) are observed for well-structured \u03b2-strands. According to the results shown in Table 4, the expected \u03b2-strand conformation was observed only for the 17-membered ring.",

A stock solution of 100 mM compound 1, 3, or 10 was prepared in DMSO and each NV 3CLpro:inhibitor complex was prepared by mixing 12 \u03bcL of 1, 3 or 10 (3 mM) with 388 \u03bcL (0.49 mM) of NV 3CLpro and incubating on ice for 1 h.
