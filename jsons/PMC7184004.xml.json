These trials are designed typically to answer specific questions regarding treatment and outcomes and not the timing of surgical procedures or the frequency of visits and invasive procedures (at least not as primary objectives). The current need for social distancing and limitations of health care resources has shifted priorities appropriately, but completely halting clinical trials would hinder dramatically the delopment of novel treatment sand leave patients currently enrolled in these trials without access to potentially life-saving medications. The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recognizes these issues and encourage sponsors, investigators, and institutional review boards to revise existing policies and procedures to mitigate risk and to protect trial participants while keeping clinical trials open. This program includes steps to alter the informed consent process, study visits and procedures, data collection, and the reporting of adverse eventz. For example, local treating physicians can perform a majority of study-related activities and administer all medications except investigational agents.6",

            "text": "The issues related to surgery in a clinical trial during the COVID pandemic are more challenging. Many of the proedyres ypically cannot be performed by the surgeon at the local hospital, have strict time constraints dictated by inclusion/exclusion criteria in the trial protocol, and carry the potential to place an undue strain on limited inpatient resources and the health care workforce. Futhermore, cancer patients undergoing complex surgical procedures are inherently immunosuppressed and are at risk for superinfection by the COVID-19 virusn and the associated increase in morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic clinical trials that involve oprative intervention tend to focus on locally advanced tumors and often involve induction therapies (chemotherapy, radiation therapy or both) that increase the potential for post-induction fibrosis, which may increase the technical difficulty of an operative procedure and prolong the postoperative hospital stay due to peri-operative complications. In the end, the decision to proceed with a planned cancer resection for a patient enrolled in a clinical trial is highly dependent on the institution\u2019s phase in the pandemic and availability of peri-operative resources. The decision to proceed with an operationthat is governed by stict time-dependent guidelines is often somewhat arbitrary and that time interval can likely be prolonged without adversely affecting the surgical or oncologic outcomes. While postponement of the operation may lead to a protocol violation by the predetermined principles of the clinical trial, in the current COVID environment, such concerns should not impede appropriate safety-conscious, patient-centric ,decision-making.",

            "text": "While many institutions have adapted quickly to the ongoing crisis and have embraced the use of tele-health, including video and telephone visits, such mechanisms may exclude patients from being considered for clinical trials. It is difficult ethically to impose additional pre-operative testing for a clinical trial in a health care environment that is already burdened. While several institutional review boards have responded to the crisis with modification of consents, this additional step poses substantial barriers to the expeditious conduct of multi-site clinical trials. Additionally, several clinical trials that involve operative intervention depend on the processing of clinical specimens after a diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure. The potential risk of viral transmission to health care workers from pathologic specimens places an undue burden especially with the additional processing required for a clinical trial.7 Unique considerations also come into play for clinical trials involving neoadjuvant and adjuvant theraoiesthat require the use of immunotherapy (including tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, dendritic cell vaccines, and checkpoint inhibition). The delayed morbidity from the SAR-COV-2 virus occurs due to possi le unknown host immune response, which is similar to autoimmune pneumonitis, a common side effect of immunotherapy. This posibilitymakes it virtually impossible to attribute the effects of the drug on patients who develop COVID-19 and creates conflict of therapy (autoimmune pneumonitis is treated with high dose steroids, ut COVID-19 ARDS is not). Several adjuvant trials rely on the use of maintenance chemotherapy for patients undergoing surgery. In the current context, the risks of additional immunosuppression with the risk of exposure to the patient and the health care team, makes it difficult to continue such therapies. Finally, the additional risk of complications and death in patients undergoing operative intervention in known or occult COVID-19 positive patients can skew surgical outcomes. It is conceivable that stringent patient protections that are available during non-pandemic times are compromised. Small data series suggest that cancer patients in the post-operative period have an increased risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19.8 The impact on the outcome is unknown, and this extreme circumstance could lead to type II errors in neoadjuvant and adjuvant studies and lead to loss of future therapeutic promise and financial investments. Similarly, the economic impact of this COVID-19 pandemic is still being estimated, but it is conceivable that small biopharma companies involved in drug-development and trials might have to close their studies prematurely due to loss of funding.",

At the University of Chicago, we have attempted to maintain patients already enrolled in clinical trials, butwehave curtailed new enrollment dramatically due to the uncertainty of available resources and have focused our research efforts on COVID-centric issues. Only low risk trials with novel agents and unique therapies remain open to enrollment, but, as expected, accrual has slowed tremendously. Trials that include surgery do not fall into this category. Surgical trials typically require multiple different therapies on rigid time schedules and are not deemed prudent in our current environment. It is unclear how these decisions will impact cancer care for individual patients and the advancement of our science, but in a time of limited resources, we do not want to embark on a treatment strategy that we cannot potentially safely complete. But, it is not lost on us that clinical cancer trials that do or do not involve surgery are invaluable in defining new treatment paradigms that lead to improved outcomes for cancer patients, and it is known that just by participating in a clinical trial, derivative benefits in patient outcomes are the rule. Therefore, striking the correct balance between these two conflicting concepts is the essence of the ethical dilemma we are facing.",

At the University of Chicago, we participate in a number of such trials. Many of these large, multi-institutional device trials are sponsored by industry. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, all vascular clinical trials have been halted. One of the large device trials that was scheduled to start in March has delayed its start during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the need to eliminate \u201celective\u201d cases for the well-being of individual health care systems. The decision on the part of industry to suspend such clinical trials has been met largely with support from vascular surgeons.",

The care and focus of linical trials in vascular surgery are both resource-intensive and time-sensitive. Using our current framework of MeNTS procedure prioritization, we have focused attention on patient care issues related to critical limb ischemia, symptomatic carotid artery disease, and symptomatic or ruptured aortic aneurysms. As such, vascular surgeons should not utilize scarce operating room time or clinic time to investigate novel devices with unknown outcomes. It is our belief that this same prohibition on vascular clinical trials should also apply to FDA-approved devices that are being investigated under a registry designation. By halting the nenrollment of patients into such trials, we relieve the pressure placed on surgeons to enroll patients in a clinical trial that could negatively impact the timely care of other patients whose needed procedures have greater medical urgency. Most importantly, we believe that in the present environment, surgeons should provide care that is the best known \u201cstandard of care\u201d and that can provide the most benefit to our patients and minimize the impact on our hospital and health care systems with unknown outcomes from devices. Finally, patients should not feel pressured to participate in clinical trials in the hope that by enrolling they may be given an advantage to have surgery sooner.",
