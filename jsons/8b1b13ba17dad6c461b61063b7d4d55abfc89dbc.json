Transplant recipients are at higher risk of infectious complica tions compared to immunocompetent hosts. Respiratory viral infections are a significant risk factor for subsequent develop ment of fungal and bacterial pneumonia. 1, 8 6. Respiratory viral infections appear to be a risk factor for both acute and chronic rejection with the greatest risk in lung trans plant recipients, 5, 911 although data on this topic in the litera ture are conflicting. 12, 13 The pathogenesis of the link between respiratory viral infections and rejection is not clearly understood. A wide range of PCRbased assays to detect respiratory viruses are commercially available, and many centers have locally developed assays that detect select viruses. Nucleic acid amplification assays appear to be the most sensitive diagnostic tools available and most allow for simultaneous detection of a broad range of respiratory pathogens from a single sample and are therefore the preferred diagnostic testing method for immunocompromised patients. 14 Multiplex PCR assays provide the advantage of identification of viruses not routinely found by conventional methods, including rhinovirus and hMPV, 1720 although multiplexing can affect the sen sitivity of the assay. Commercially available multiplex assays differ in sensitivity and specificity for different viruses most notably ade novirus, 17, 2123 and the clinician should be aware of the performance characteristics of the assay used. For influenza, PCR assays can dis tinguish among viral subtypes and can quantify viral load. Although not available at all centers, rapid PCRbased assays allow rapid re sults (within 34 hours), particularly for influenza and RSV, although their sensitivity may vary among virus types. 24, 25 Rapid antigen detection is available for influenza and RSV and has the advantage of rapid result testing (within 15'), but suboptimal sensitivity (between 50% and 60%) and low predictive value. 26, 27 Several studies of direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of primary patient specimens have documented sensitivity that approached that of PCR for certain viruses. 28 ",

LAIV is con traindicated in SOT recipients and close contacts, due to a poten tial risk of dissemination of the vaccine strain. One dose of the seasonal intramuscular trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine is the standard of care in adults, and two doses 4 weeks apart are recommended for na\u00efve children <9 years of age.36 Immunogenicity of influenza vaccine is variable in SOT recipients, depending on the type of organ, immunosuppressive regimen used, and composition of the vaccine.37 However, there are increasing data reporting on the beneficial effects of influenza vaccination in SOT recipients. In lung transplant recipients, vaccination with adjuvanted influenza A H1N1/09 vaccine was associated with a reduced incidence of subse quent influenza infection (1.3% vs 25% in unvaccinated patients).38 Influenza vaccination was also associated with a lower risk of graft loss and death in kidney transplant recipients.39 Even if vaccinated patients develop influenza, a reduction in the severity of the disease and in viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab as compared to unvacci nated patients has been observed.7,40 Previous vaccination has been associated with a lower risk for pneumonia and ICU stay in a large cohort of SOT and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) re cipients. 7 Influenza vaccine is therefore highly recommended for all SOT recipients and household members.36 Influenza vaccine is well tolerated in SOT recipients, and adverse events to vaccination are usually mild and short lived.41 Recent randomized controlled trials found increased immunogenicity in SOT recipients using a highdose vaccine or a booster strategy using two doses of the standard dosevaccine 5 weeks apart. 42,43 These approaches can be particularly used in case of an expected lower response to the vaccine due to en hanced immunosuppression. The reader is referred to the American Society of Transplantation Vaccine Guidelines in this series for a de tailed discussion of influenza vaccines. Antiviral prophylaxis with oseltamivir may be an alternative to influenza vaccination in cases of contraindication or expected di minished response to the vaccine. A randomized controlled trial in transplant recipients found that prophylaxis had ~80% efficacy. 44 In case of a close contact with a patient with documented influ enza, SOT recipients may receive postexposure prophylaxis with a oseltamivir, 45 particularly in case of high risk for complications (nos ocomial influenza early after transplant, 16 lung transplant recipients, or during therapy of rejection).",

Use of corticosteroids and im munomodulators including immunoglobulin (IVIG), RSV-IVIG (no longer available), and palivizumab has been investigated as adjunctive therapy.Consensus on the treatment of RSV in solid organ transplant recipients remains unsettled, however, as there are no randomized, placebocon trolled trials in this population. Wide variations in approach have been reported.75 Lung and heartlung recipients are usually treated for both upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Some nonlung recipients with lower respiratory infection may also be treated, but those with upper respiratory infection are generally not treated.75 A comprehensive review of the management of RSV infection in adult HSCT recipients showed that for patients treated with rib avirin, regardless of form or duration of therapy or the addition of an immunomodulator (palivizumab, IVIG, or RSV-IVIG), the rate of progression from upper respiratory to lower respiratory infection was much lower than in patients who did not receive any form of RSV therapy. Mortality rate was also lower in treated patients with lower respiratory infection.77 It also reported a trend toward a bet ter outcome in progression to lower respiratory infection and death among patients treated with aerosolized ribavirin and an immuno modulator than those treated with aerosolized ribavirin alone.77 Published studies in symptomatic lung transplant and there is increasing evidence, although only in ob servational studies, of the efficacy of oral ribavirin in immunocom promised adults83 and lung transplant recipients. 7981 Oral ribavirin can be considered especially in areas where aerosolized ribavirin is not available. Most patients also received corticosteroids and some received IVIG as well. Importantly, oral ribavirin is associated with significant toxicity including hemolytic anemia, leucopenia, and neuropsychological symptoms, and its use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Large, multicenter, placebocontrolled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these alternative treatments including oral ribavirin in solid organ transplant recipients.
