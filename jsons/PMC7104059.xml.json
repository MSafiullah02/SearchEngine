From 1990 to 2013, about 90% of global mortality caused by disasters happened in low and middle-income countries [2]. Asian countries are the most vulnerable to disasters in the world. In 2017, 44% of the global disaster events happened in Asia, which account for 58% of the total fatalities and 70% of the total people affected [2]. The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Disasters (UNISDR) highlights the negative impacts of disasters, including the threat to human life and dignity, driving vulnerable people into impoverishment, degrading the environment, and challenging efforts for sustainable development of communities [3].",

The world's urban population is expected to rise from the current 54% to about two-thirds by 2030, most of which will take place in developing countries, with Asia and Africa alone expected to account for around 90% of the estimated 2.5 billion increase in global urban population between 2015 and 2050 [7].

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.5 targets, by 2030, to \u201csignificantly reduce deaths and economic losses caused by disasters, including water-related disasters\u201d [7]. Also, advancing climate change adaptation is contingent upon managing the hazards of extreme events and disasters [8,9]. The literature stresses the importance of public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in developing and implementing disaster management plans, building resilience and adaptation measures, which refer to adjustment in the existing physical, socioeconomic or political systems in response to actual or anticipated risks [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Developing risk management procedures is also hampered by the dearth of data. According to the 2018 review of SDGs implementation, \u201ca number of challenges in data availability to track progress towards implementation of SDG 11 also present significant barriers to assessing global progress on the goal\u201d [1]. Enhancing public awareness of disaster risks is found to effectively enhance disaster risk management by formulating more effective hazard mitigation policies and intervention measures. Citizens are nowadays seen as active partners in risk management, which is an emerging and popular field of disaster science [4,16,17].",

The country is placed on the 84th highest position on the 2018 Global Climate Risk Index due to frequent coastal flooding, lack of freshwater sources, high temperatures, and vegetation cover of less than 2% of the total land area [19]. Despite the existence of many seismic and volcanic areas, the country has only experienced low-magnitude earthquakes of not more than 4 on the Richter scale [18]. The most catastrophic disasters in the country are floods, sandstorms, and disease epidemics such as swine flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Rift Valley fever [16,[20], [21], [22]]. In 2009, swine flu affected 15850 people and caused 124 deaths throughout the country [20]; p. 12). Jeddah and Dammam cities being coastal settlements, and Riyadh being surrounded by valleys are the three major cities that faced yearly incidences of floods in the country. However, \u201cless attention is paid to natural disasters, despite their frequent occurrence and the devastation they caused on people's lives and property\u201d compared to human-made disasters such as fires, stampedes and road accidents [21]; p. 3256).",

Also, emotions such as fear, cynicism, and helplessness concerning disaster risks play a vital part in risk perception [26]. Similarly, social capital can provide considerable social protection that can mitigate the adverse effect of disasters [4]. In Nagoya City (Japan) for example, the four main factors that influence people's preparedness for disasters are the level of disaster anticipation and fear, disaster experience, the enormity of damage from a previous disaster, and homeownership [33]. Disaster awareness fosters behavioral change for reducing a wide range of risks. It is a facilitator of taking precautionary measures and protective behaviors such as taking property insurance, staying in a safe area and away from windows, not driving, informational listening and checking for updates, and following evacuation instructions from local authorities [24]. Given that disaster perception and awareness are useful in assessing the level of public preparedness, it is imperative to ask: to what extent do the residents of cities that are vulnerable to natural hazards such as Dammam perceive the risks of disasters?",

Therefore, exploring public perception of disaster risks can assist emergency and public health agencies with the information essential for formulating relevant risk management strategies and educational programs required to raise public awareness about disaster risks and behavior change, which are vital in building confidence about and ensuring compliance with official instructions [24]. Public perception and attitudes toward disaster risks are the key drivers of precautionary actions, and thus an important source of information about and determinant of public behavioral outcomes.

In about half a century (1950\u20132014), the population has dramatically risen from 100,000 to almost 1.66 million people, which is expected to reach 2.13 million in the next decade [36]. The size of DMA has expanded from a small fishing town to a metropolis spanning about 562 km2 with a population density of about 2000 persons/km2 [37]. DMA consists of the three main cities; Dammam, Khobar and Dhahran, in addition to the suburban area of Aziziyah and Half Moon Bay (Fig. 1\n). While the city of Dammam contains most of the regional administrative institutions, Khobar city consists of commercial centers and corporate headquarters, and Dhahran city serves as the center for science and technology, as it hosts Dhahran Techno-valley and the headquarter of Saudi Arabian American Oil Company. Aziziyah and Half Moon Bay area is a new sprawling residential development along the Arabian/Persian Gulf, famous for its recreational and tourist centers. The study area has been recently experiencing severe storms that left streets drenched, homes and schools in low-lying areas flooded and residents stranded when their day-to-day lives were disrupted [38]. These incidences have caused road and rail accidents, injuries, loss of properties and damage to infrastructure and the local economy [39].",

Globally, out of 335 cases of disasters that killed 9697 people in 2017, there were more incidences of floods (37.9%), followed by storms (37.6%), with earthquakes coming distant third (6.6%) [2]; p. 3). In Saudi Arabia, the agency responsible for disaster risk reduction is the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment, whereas the General Directorate of Civil Defense is responsible for emergency planning and response [18]. However, disaster risk management is yet to create a framework to support local participatory efforts in the country [41].",

Most of the questions were close-ended requiring responses on a five-point Likert Scale: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree. Other questions require ranking of responses as well as selecting from yes, no, or neutral options. The questionnaire was designed in English with Arabic translation. It was first piloted among the researchers\u2019 colleagues to improve its validity by testing the accuracy of the questions [42].",

The link to the survey was distributed via email and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) using a snowball sampling technique in which respondents were asked to share the link with others living in the study area [44]. After four months, the questionnaire has reached 683 participants, which according to Cochran's formula is considered an adequate sample size for a city of 1.17 million people and based on 0.05 level of significance [45]. Ethical issues have been taken into consideration. The confidentiality of all participants and utilizing the survey data for only academic purposes have been guaranteed in writing, as well as the voluntary nature of participation in the study. Snowballing, albeit being a non-probability sampling approach, is considered a robust scientific approach that enables a researcher to anonymously study a community and with a high response rate [44]. Moreover, it is beneficial in circumstances where it is challenging or expensive to reach study participants. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, it is quite difficult to distribute print questionnaires to the public or recruit female respondents due to cultural privacy concerns [46].",

Because the four settlements that constituted DMA differ in proximity to the Arabian/Persian Gulf, this study also explored whether there is a significant relationship between the difference in respondents\u2019 place of residence and their perception of disaster risks. This is because previous studies have strongly linked location with different levels of risk perception [24]. The Chi-square value (56.18) shows a statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship between respondents' thoughts about the likelihood of imminent disasters and their location (Table 3). In all the four cities that constitute the study area, respondents that believed that they could be affected by a disaster at any time are almost twice those that think that they cannot be affected. This could be attributed to the incidences of floods that occur almost annually in their cities [23].",

As Table 7\nshows, television is the main existing avenue respondents used to access disaster-related information (28%), followed by mobile text messages (24%). However, close to half (46%) preferred to access such information via text messages, followed by social media like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp (27%). By relegating from the first existing information source to the fourth preferred source, it seems that television is becoming an outdated avenue of disseminating information about disasters. The radio, newspapers, family and friends and other approaches such as meetings and seminars also remain the last four (ranked 5\u20138) existing and preferred approaches. Thus, mobile phone text messages and social media are key in contributing to raising public awareness about and raising their confidence level in responding to disaster risks.",

A prior national study has reported that 78% of the participants were aware of the risks of the last disaster that affected the country [16]. In Taiwan, landslide received the highest risk rating followed by floods and earthquakes, but contagious diseases were considered the least risky [12]. Globally, in 2017, floods ranked first (34.4%) in terms of human loss due to disasters, followed by storms (25.9%), landslides (23.8%) and earthquakes (10.4%) ([2]; p. 4).

In Cologne, self-protective manners by residents of urban areas prone to floods helped in reducing the economic cost of floods by about 80% [24]. In Jingdezhen city in China, only 13.8% of the participants of a study held that the public should also be responsible for flood protection [17]. In the north of Italy, 60% of study participants felt willing to adopt some behaviors for reducing their vulnerability to floods or landslides [13]. Thus, residents of DMA should be encouraged to be more willing to partake in disaster risk reduction activities using platforms such as online social media and educational institutions, which are effective avenues for changing common perceptions of disaster risks, increasing public awareness about disaster management, and encouraging them to take cautionary behaviors [30,32].",

However, our respondents' opinion sharply contrasts with experts\u2019 assessment of the quality of flood disaster management by Civil Defense and Red Crescent after the 2009\u20132010 floods in Jeddah. According to the experts (40 senior officials involved in disaster and emergency management in the city), response time and efficiency were the most important factors for reducing disaster risks [21]. In line with the findings of this study, adopting protective behaviors such as having a working flashlight, a list of emergency phone numbers and teaching relatives and neighbors what to do in emergency cases are the most important approaches for reducing flood risks in the north of Italy [13]. Choices of cautionary and protective behaviors made by persons living in disaster-prone settlements are related to their risk awareness, perception, and evaluation [5].",

In another study, Alshehri et al. [16] found that 55% of study participants access official information about biological disasters through the Internet. After the 2011 flood in Jeddah, online social media was used for publicizing the gravity of the disaster, advising people what to do and what to avoid, and mobilization for help and rescue [32].

There is also the need to improve public access to vital information about disaster preparedness for increasing community awareness, knowledge and skills in disaster risk mitigation [52]. In 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Interior has developed emergency call and operation centers for event reporting and dispatch operations towards enhancing disaster response efficiency to be established in each of the country's 13 provinces [53]. While these centers could support the operational capacities of safety and security agencies [53], utilizing social media can facilitate citizen participation and engagement in public affairs. Social media can be effective for disaster warning and evacuation procedures and it can influence decision-makers to be more responsive in disaster mitigation. They are also effective in motivating and guiding inhabitants of disaster-prone areas to actively partake in risk preparedness and prevention [24]. Integrating local knowledge with scientific and technical know-how is crucial to disaster risk management for minimizing human and economic losses [31].",
