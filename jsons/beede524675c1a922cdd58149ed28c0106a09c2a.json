We are concerned with endemic equilibrium and disease-free fixed points and numerical solutions of these models with different type of numerical techniques. We also consider additive fractional white noise representation of the SIRS model and obtain numerical and exact solutions of these models. In the modeling of epidemic diseases via compartmental type mathematical models, there exists not any study considering fractional white noise, Wick product and fractional-order operators all together. Our driving motivation in this paper is to investigate the applicability of these significant and powerful techniques to the modeling of epidemic diseases. Our contributions in this paper may be listed as: i) Generating a new SIRS model. ii.) Considering this system in terms of stochastic equations and fractional white noise. iii) Studying chaos at disease-free and endemic steady state points. iv) Solving perturbed systems (perturbed from deterministic to fractional-stochastic) both numerically and explicitly (exactly). We provided Figures illustrating the behavior of compartments in different environments. From this listed contributions, we can say that the present paper is totally a new contribution to mathematical biologists studying compartment models by fractional and stochastic differential equations. We believe that researchers in this area will employ the present paper and extend it to different models.",

To the best of our knowledge, there exists not any mathematical model for a epidemic disease which considers both fractional-order operators and white noise together. Now, we perturb the fractional-order system (3) into a new system (mostly known as fractional-stochastic system) by an additive white noise to the-rightmost side of each equation in the system. Our major aim in the section is to illustrate the use of both fractional-order operators and white noise together and test the effectiveness of resulting new model. It is possible to generate some other fractional-order stochastic SIRS models simply by a new type of fractional order operator or the changing the way of adding the noise to the system.
