It can also increase the risk of injury due to a lack of adapted equipment or poor knowledge of the physical exercises to perform. Moreover, social ties are essential to encourage older adults to perform physical activity [14]. Reduced social ties for older adults during quarantine could lead to a significant decrease in physical activity. In addition, loneliness could accelerate physical and cognitive decline in older adults [15].",

Our study suggests that older adults do not want to use these online tools. Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. Among older adults, there are cultural, sociological, and economic differences that need to be considered when developing targeted messages that echo a target audience\u2019s existing views and practices, to produce more powerful persuasive effects.
