In this study, we describe respiratory infections associated with EV-D68 in Beijing over a 4 year period. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 7,945 clinical specimens collected between January 5, 2011 and July 30, 2015 in Beijing and used for detecting EV-D68 and other enteroviruses by real-time PCR. Overall, 555/7,945 (6.99%) specimens were enterovirus positive: 12/7,945 (0.2%) specimens were EV-D68 positive. Of these patients, 11 were pediatric patients and 1 was a 76-year-old man. The main symptoms for the 12 EV-D68 positive patients were fever (10/12, 83.3%) and cough (6/12, 50%). Ten EV-D68 infection cases were identified in autumn or winter season. The phylogenetic relationships of the 12 EV-D68 viral strains with other strains were analyzed based on the sequences of viral protein 1(VP1). The EV-D68 strains from 2011 to 2013 belonged to groups 1 or 3, while all strains in 2014 were clustered into group 1 together with the strains circulating in the USA. In conclusion, EV-D68 played a role in respiratory infections in Beijing during this period. In addition, the most common EV-D68 strain detected was similar to that circulating in the USA in 2014.",

It can cause mild to severe respiratory infections. More recently, circulation of three different EV-D68 clades based on the phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences has been reported worldwide [Kaida et al., 2011; Rahamat-Langendoen et al., 2011; Ikeda et al., 2012; Lauinger et al., 2012; Linsuwanon et al., 2012; Meijer et al., 2012; Piralla et al., 2012; Tokarz et al., 2012] . A nationwide outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory infection was reported in the USA from mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015 and a total of 1,153 people were affected during this epidemic (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68. html). The EV-D68 outbreaks in the USA have resulted in a worldwide public health concern with emergences of EV-D68 infections in Denmark, Australia, France, and Italy [Bal et al., 2015; Esposito et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2015; Midgley et al., 2015] . In China, sporadic cases of EV-D68 were reported between August 2006 and June 2012 [Xiang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2014] . In a previous study, we identified one EVD68 strain in a respiratory specimen from a severe pneumonia case in Beijing in 2014 [Zhang et al., 2015] . There have been no further reports about the EV-D68 infection in Beijing since then, especially after the US EV-D68 pandemic in 2014.",

All clinical specimens were tested in parallel for EV-D68 and other enteroviruses with real-time PCR. EV-D68 positive specimens were also tested for other respiratory pathogens. Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships of EV-D68 strains from Beijing, China and other available countries are also described in this study. The VP1 fragment of EV-D68 positive specimens was amplified and sequenced as previously described [Tokarz et al., 2012] . The consensus VP1 sequences were assembled using DNASTAR software, Version 5.0 (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) and aligned with MEGA software, version 6.0 [Tamura et al., 2013] . The phylogenetic relationships of representative VP1 sequences of EV-D68 from Beijing, China and other available countries (The USA, Republic of South Africa, Japan, France, Netherlands, Thailand, Senegal, and Gambia) were estimated by using the maximum-likelihood method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates with MEGA software, version 6.0. The evolutionary distances were estimated for EV-D68 VP1 sequences from 13 Beijing EV-D68 strains, the prototype EV-D68 (Fermon strain, AY426531) and one reference strain circulating in the USA in 2014 (US/MO/14-18948 strain, KM851226) using Maximum Composite Likelihood model (500 bootstrap replicates) with MEGA, version 6.0.",

            "text": "In recent years, outbreaks caused by EV-D68 respiratory infection have been reported in many parts of the world [Kaida et al., 2011; Ikeda et al., 2012; Tokarz et al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2012; Renois et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2015; Midgley et al., 2015] . To understand the EV-D68 circulation in Beijing, we investigated the clinical specimens from patients with respiratory infections for EV-D68 during the period 2011-2015. In this study, the rate of EV-D68 (0.20%) in Beijing is lower than the rates reported in Italy (0.24%) [Piralla et al., 2014] , the Netherlands (0.95%) [Poelman et al., 2015] , Philippines (1.10%) [Furuse et al., 2015] , Germany (7.70%) [Reiche et al., 2015] , Denmark (10.80%) [Midgley et al., 2015] , and Norway (11.00%) [Bragstad et al., 2015] . The low rate of EV-D68 detected in this study may be a consequence of the sampling method as the clinical specimens were collected from all age groups. Adults accounted for 56.5% of the respiratory infection cases while EV-D68 mainly affects children. In addition, this could be a result of sampling time frame with no EV-D68 infections detected in Beijing during the period of January to July of 2015, which is not the EV-D68 circulating season.",

Similar phenomena were observed in the Germany and the Netherlands [Meijer et al., 2014; Reiche et al., 2015] . All of 12 EV-D68 patients were without any underlying disease. Many EV-D68 pediatric patients in the USA in 2014, had asthma or a history of wheezing, and were admitted to the ICU requiring bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. This indicates that children with underlying disease are more likely to be seriously affected by EV-D68 infection.",

The EV-D68 strains circulating in autumn were described in Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and the USA [Khetsuriani et al., 2006; Kaida et al., 2011; Rahamat-Langendoen et al., 2011; Tokarz et al., 2012; Piralla et al., 2014] . Our study indicates that EV-D68 could also cause the respiratory infection in the summer and winter. The phylogenetic relationship between EV-D68 strains circulating in Beijing, China, and other countries showed that EV-D68 strains from Beijing circulating in 2011 to 2013 belonged to group 1 or 3, while all of the strains in 2014 belonged to group 1 together with the strains circulating in the USA in 2014. In 2011, some other EV-D68 strains from China were clustered into group 1 together with the strains circulating in the USA. The Beijing EV-D68 strains in group 1 were also shown to be closely related to the USA reference strain in 2014 by evolutionary distance estimation. These results demonstrated that EV-D68 strains similar to those circulating in the USA in 2014 already existed in China from 2011 and became predominant strains circulating in Beijing in 2014.",
