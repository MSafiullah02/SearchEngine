This review focuses on the currently available molecular diagnostic platforms for respiratory virus detection with potential for use as point-of-care tests (POCT) and explores the current landscape for POCT in adults.",

A recent Canadian study estimated that only around 1 in 14 emergency department visits due to influenza virus infection were correctly attributed to influenza.42 It is likely, therefore, that the burden of influenza and its economic impact have been under-estimated.",

Time to result is generally around fifteen minutes, they are easy to use and do not require laboratory support, and generally involve visual inspection of a test line (in addition to a control line). Unfortunately the clinical utility of rapid antigen based detection for respiratory viruses has been limited by their unacceptably poor sensitivity, especially in adults where it is around 50% for influenza56 and lower for RSV,57 meaning that they cannot be used to rule out infection. The Sofia Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) is a benchtop analyser that combines lateral flow immunofluorescence-based antigen detection test kits with an optical sensor and provides a result in around 10 min. Test kits are available for influenza and RSV which are both FDA approved and CE marked. Sensitivity for detection of influenza is around 80% compared to PCR and so may be higher than for some other rapid antigen tests.58 Although it has not been evaluated in adults, in children the sensitivity for detection of RSV was around 70% compared to PCR but would be expected to be lower in adults.59\n",

Priority areas include improved diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses including the creation and use of cheap, accurate and easy to use POCTs.82\n",

Antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with acute respiratory illness is near universal despite the predominance of viruses and the low frequency of detectable bacteria in much of this patient group. Fig. 1\nshows antibiotic use by detected pathogen in a large study of hospitalised adults from the UK.4 Furthermore patients with acute respiratory illness syndromes that are known to be principally virally induced, such as exacerbations of asthma and acute bronchitis, are often treated with antibiotics despite the lack of evidence for benefit, and in the case of asthma, national guidelines discouraging their use.83, 84, 85 In the study from the UK referenced above almost 60% of patients hospitalised with an exacerbation of asthma received at least one dose of antibiotic whilst in hospital.4 The use of respiratory virus POCT could potentially reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in patients with acute respiratory illness especially in those conditions known to be principally viral and where antibiotic use has not shown benefit, by demonstrating to clinicians that the patient's illness and fever are explained by the presence of a virus. Patients with uncomplicated Influenza-like illness caused by respiratory viruses including influenza, are often treated with antibiotics due to diagnostic confusion with bacterial infection. In these patients the early detection of a respiratory virus in the absence of evidence of concomitant bacterial infection may prevent unnecessary antibiotic use.",

A large randomised control trial evaluating the clinical and health economic benefits of rapid antigen testing for influenza in hospitalised adults did not demonstrate any improvement in antibiotic use or other clinical or health economic benefits in those tested with rapid antigen tests compared to laboratory testing.86 In a small non-randomised study of hospitalised adults rapid diagnostic testing for influenza using antigen detection demonstrated small reductions in antibiotic use (74% vs 99%) with no increase in adverse events in those where antibiotics were withheld.87 Studies in children including several small randomised controlled trials have evaluated the impact of routine rapid antigen testing for influenza on antibiotic use, with inconsistent results.88, 89, 90, 91, 92 For molecular tests the evidence base is even more limited with trials using molecular testing platform within the laboratory rather than as POCT, with the associated prolonged turnaround times. The impact of respiratory virus testing in adult outpatients with acute respiratory illness was assessed in a small randomised controlled trial using laboratory-based PCR. Results were available the next day in those randomised to viral PCR testing and even with this delay antibiotic prescribing was significantly reduced compared to those treated with standard care (5% vs 12%).93 As noted above the FilmArray respiratory platform has been clinically evaluated in a single centre paediatric study where the platform was not used as a POCT but was housed within the central laboratory. Although not a randomised controlled trial it demonstrated reductions in antibiotic use in those testing positive for viruses with the FilmArray versus standard laboratory PCR, although only when results were available within 4 h, underscoring the importance of rapid results and suggesting possible further reductions if the platform was used as a POCT.71\n",

Following the recent publication of the independent meta-analysis of oseltamivir trials,98 an editorial letter (published in the Lancet) suggested that, in view of the modest efficacy and moderate risk of nausea and vomiting with oseltamivir, the administration of this drug should ideally be directed with the use of diagnostic tests rather than used empirically.99 The use of a molecular point-of-care test has the potential to allow implementation of directed rather than empirical NAI treatment thus maximising clinical benefit for those with influenza infection and minimising unnecessary antiviral exposure and drug related adverse events in those without.",

Currently cases are isolated based on clinical suspicion with laboratory testing providing definitive results in 24\u201348 h. This leads to patients without infection occupying valuable isolation facilities unnecessarily for several days and reducing patient flow through the hospital. Although intuitively POCTs for respiratory viruses performed in emergency departments should improve isolation facility use and patient flow there is a paucity of quality evidence for the effects of POCTs in this setting. A systematic review of published literature on the subject of POCTs for the diagnosis of infectious diseases concluded that although POCTs may have a role in infection control the lack of good, consistent clinical data surrounding their use outside of the laboratory is a limiting factor in their implementation.111 A single centre non-randomised paediatric study from the UK suggested significant improvement in isolation facility use and patient flow with rapid antigen based POCT for RSV during the winter months.112 The previously mentioned non-randomised pre and post intervention paediatric study using the FilmArray respiratory panel as a POCT demonstrated a reduction in the time spent in isolation facilities in patients tested with POCT versus standards laboratory PCR testing.71\n",

A study using decision analytic modelling to ascertain the most cost effective testing strategy in children presenting to the emergency department with influenza-like illness suggested that rapid PCR using the FilmArray respiratory panel was superior to standard laboratory PCR or rapid antigen testing. However the incremental costs per QALY were high and many questionable assumptions about the effects of diagnosing a respiratory virus infection on investigations, antibiotic and antiviral use were made.114 Another study using health economic modelling evaluated the cost effectiveness of PCR based rapid diagnostics (Cepheid Xpert Flu assay) for the diagnosis of influenza in high risk adults presenting to the emergency department. They concluded that PCR based rapid testing was the most cost effective strategy although this depended on the prevalence of influenza and again was based on strong assumptions of antiviral use and efficacy.115\n",

The potential benefits of such a strategy include a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use, improved use of directed antiviral therapy for influenza, improved use of isolation facilities in secondary care, a reduction in the number of investigations performed and a reduction in the duration of hospitalisation in some situations. These effects could be associated with an overall health economic benefit. There is a substantial evidence gap and high quality randomised controlled trials evaluating molecular POCTs in adults and using clinically relevant outcomes such as antibiotic use, directed antiviral use and infection control facility use are urgently needed. In addition to the existing agents active against influenza there may soon also be available a range of clinically effective antiviral agents active against other respiratory viruses such as RSV and rhinovirus. For these agents to be utilised effectively, especially in hospitalised patients with severe disease, routine early testing for the presence of viruses with molecular POCTs will be necessary to allow targeted treatment.",
