HCoV-HKU1 was discovered in 2005 in Hong Kong and, although it did not result in an outbreak and had only restricted spread, this virus is probably still circulating in the population [13, 14] . However, the negativity of an IVIG reaction using a single ELISA coronavirus kit does not mean that such IVIG does not contain antibodies against this pathogen. ELISA sensitivity relies on factors such as the antigen used, the sequence, the organism used to produce it, and the amount of material coated. ELISA results should only be compared qualitatively, since the comparison of the results between different kits is difficult based on differences in sensitivity, and there is no gold standard for quantification. This was confirmed in our results for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein subunit antigen, in which different ELISA kits showed different reactivities. In addition, there is scarcity of tests for common coronaviruses.",

IVIG products have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disorders [16] . Hence, IVIG is considered a therapeutic option for hyperinflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 [17] . To date, a number of possible mechanisms for the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG therapy have been described [18, 19] , including anticomplement effects [20] , anti-idiotypic neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies [21] , immune regulation via an inhibitory Fc receptor [16, 22] , enhancement of regulatory T cells [23] and inhibition of Th17 differentiation [24] . Thus, IVIG may mediate a wide variety of biological and immunomodulatory effects via various types of blood cells [24] . When considered together, these immunomodulatory effects of IVIG products might be beneficial in COVID-19 disease management, but this needs to be confirmed clinically. Although IVIG may not confer protection against SARS-CoV-2, the role of antibodies crossreacting with SARS-Cov-2 has been suggested by exerting a priming effect on host immune response or through an immunomodulatory action on monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages [25] .",
