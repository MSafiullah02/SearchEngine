Numerous CLRs belong to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that recognize foreign pathogens, and play key roles in host immune responses [1], [2]. The type II CLRs are classified as their cytoplasmic tail (CT) located in the NH2 terminus domain. Other type II CLRs domains include the transmembrane domain (TMD) following the CT, a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) exposed extracellularly at the carboxyl terminus, and the neck domain between the TMD and CRD [1], [2].",

            "text": "A human gene cluster of type II CLRs, CD23/CLEC4G/DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, which is localized in human chromosome 19p13.3, has received increasing interest during the past few years. Human CD23 (FCER2) is a low affinity IgE receptor that plays an important role in cell\u2013cell adhesions, B cells survival and antigen presentation [3]. Human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN, CD209) was initially identified as an ICAM-3 binding protein mediating dendritic cells (DCs) and T cell interaction, an ICAM-2 binding protein regulating chemokine-induced trafficking of DCs across both resting and activated endothelium, and a HIV-1 gp120 receptor mediating transmission of HIV-1 to susceptible cells in trans\n[4], [5], [6]. The second hDC-SIGN homologue, hL-SIGN (CD209L), was subsequently shown to have similar but subtly distinct property of pathogen recognition to hDC-SIGN [7]. Both hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN bind to asparagines-linked high-mannose glycans present on a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses [8]. Human CLEC4G (hCLEC4G, previously named LSECtin), co-expressed with hL-SIGN on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSECs), is the third hDC-SIGN-related CLR recently identified [9], [10]. hCLEC4G was found to interact with the surface glycoproteins of Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [11]. However, unlike hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN, the hCLEC4G selectively binds to glycoproteins terminating in a disaccharide, GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man, resulting in its interacting with truncated glycans on glycoprotein of Ebola virus [12]. Since these four CLRs form a tight gene cluster and share overall protein domain structure, similar genomic organization and possible analogous function, it has been proposed that they are derived from a common ancestor [9].",

            "text": "DC-SIGN homologues have been experimentally identified from other mammalian species including non-human primates and mouse [13], [14], [15]. Interestingly, there exist seven mouse DC-SIGN paralogues, SIGNRs 1\u20135 as well as SIGNRs 7\u20138, on mouse chromosome 8A1.1, indicating widely divergent biochemical and probably physiological properties of DC-SIGN-related proteins in mouse [14]. However, none of these SIGNR molecules were shown to be the functional orthologue to hDC-SIGN. Recently, DC-SIGN homologues from domesticated animal species such as dog, cattle and horse have also been predicted from the completed genome projects. We recently reported the molecular cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA and gene of porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN) in the absence of computer-based screening of DC-SIGN homologues in pig genome database [16]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pDC-SIGN, together with the putative bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN, are more closely related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 than to human DC-SIGN or other mouse SIGNR homologues and form a separate clade, indicating a distinct evolutionary pathway [16]. Since no other DC-SIGN sequences were detected in the bovine and canis genomes, the pDC-SIGN likely exists as a single gene analogously, although the relevant porcine genomic region has not been identified. Moreover, we observed that L-SIGN homologues only exist in human and non-human primates but not in other non-primate mammalian species [16]. Indeed, a previous study showed that the current L-SIGN gene, presented in apes such as chimpanzee and human but not in Old World monkeys (OWM) such as rhesus macaque, was newly duplicated from the ancestral DC-SIGN, whereas the older duplicator, CD209L2, was lost in human but still retained in OWM and apes [13]. The study indicated that the DC-SIGN/L-SIGN gene family in primates has undergone duplications and deletions during recent evolutionary processes [13].",

Based on this sequence, we designed gene-specific primers and then successfully amplified a 909-bp fragment containing the complete coding region of pCLEC4G cDNA from pig liver by RT-PCR (Fig. 1\n). In addition, a smaller fragment representing a pCLEC4G isoform lacking the transmembrane domain (807 bp) was also identified (Fig. 1). Besides these two isoforms, a series of higher-molecular-weight bands were amplified (Fig. 1), which are recognized as the intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA during splicing (see discussion below). The pCLEC4G gene (2721 bp), which was not available on the public draft assembly of pig genome project in the early 2008, was also cloned by using the genomic PCR with the same pair of PCR primers (Fig. 1).",

The exon 4 sequence of chimpanzee CLEC4G gene that is assumed to contain nine exons has not been available thus far. Three CLEC4G gene homologues, named as equine CLEC4Gs 1\u20133 in this study, were found in horse genome database. The equine CLEC4G1 and CLEC4G2 also have 9 exons with the same gene structure whereas equine CLEC4G3 only contains 8 exons. The missing of one exon in equine CLEC4G3 is caused by the fusion of two neck-domain-encoding exons (exons 3 and 4 corresponding to pCLEC4G gene) of the canonical 9-exon-containing CLEC4G gene into one. Similarly, the merging of exons 3 and 4 of the canonical 9-exon-containing CLEC4G gene into one exon results in a total of eight exons for the putative human CLEC4G pseudogene. However, the loss of protein-coding ability of the human pseudogene, along with the chimpanzee CLEC4G pseudogene, is due to a point mutation (G to A) at the proposed ATG start codon (Fig. 3). Two rhesus macaque CLEC4G homologues, CLEC4G1 and CLEC4G2, were predicted based upon the genomic sequencing data. However, in spite of the existence of nine exons, both homologues encode a carboxyl terminus-truncated protein product with CRD deletion due to a 1-nt insertion on exon 3 (for CLEC4G1) or a 1-nt deletion on exon 5 (for CLEC4G2), which are also recognized as the pseudogenes (Fig. 3).",

Compared to other CLEC4G homologues without the first ATG at the corresponding position, the deduced pCLEC4G protein is predicted to start at the second in-frame ATG and encompasses an ORF of 873-nt encoding a protein of 290 amino acids (Fig. 2b). The pCLEC4G protein is a putative type II transmembrane protein beginning from a 28-aa cytoplasmic tail followed by a predicted 22-aa TMD. The extracellular domain consists of a 111-aa neck region followed by a 129-aa CRD (Fig. 2b). Two potential internalization motifs, YSKW and EE at aa position 6\u20139 and 14\u201315, respectively, were found within the CT, which are conserved in human, chimpanzee, bovine, ovine and canis CLEC4Gs. Mutagenesis analysis has shown that the internalization ability of the hCLEC4G is dependent on the integrity of both motifs [10]. Equine CLEC4Gs 1 and 3, mouse, rat and two platypus CLEC4G homologues also harbor the tyrosine-based motif as the potential internalization signal (data not shown). The neck region of hCLEC4G contains two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and has a typical heptad repeat pattern that is expected to form \u03b1-helix coiled-coil structures [12]. A recent study also revealed that hCLEC4G exists as a disulfide-lined dimmer by two cysteine residues in the neck region [12]. All these features are identical in pCLEC4G as well as in other mammal CLEC4Gs except for equine CLEC4G3, opossum and platypus CLEC4Gs (data not shown). We previously found that human DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, non-human primate DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR1 contains variable repeated sequence within the neck region, whereas the remaining mouse SIGNR members (except for SIGNR2 and SIGNR6) together with porcine, bovine, ovine, canis and equine DC-SIGNs do not have the repeated sequence [16].

All placental mammalian CLEC4Gs share a unique Ala residue distinct from DC-SIGNs at aa 233, whereas the residue at aa 237 is variable among CLEC4G homologues. All CLEC4G members share the Asp, residue instead of the conserved Asn residue, at aa 263. The conserved Asp269 of C-type lectins is identical in most of the CLEC4G proteins but is substituted by an Asn residue in human and chimpanzee CLEC4G as well as in opossum CLEC4G1. In addition, there are 9 and 29 unique residues in the CRD shared by all mammalian CLEC4G proteins and placental mammalian CLEC4Gs, respectively (Fig. 4a). These unique substitutions suggested that the CLEC4G family members would be expected to have different sugar-binding abilities.",

However, although the Gly259 is conserved in all CLEC4G proteins, only chimpanzee CLEC4G shares the Trp265 residue with the hCLEC4G (Fig. 4a). The residue at this position is variable among other CLEC4G proteins: Leu in pCLEC4G, Met in bovine, ovine and canis CLEC4Gs, and Gln in three equine CLEC4Gs.

Thousands of different miRNAs from multicellular organisms and some viruses have been identified and shown to have both tissue-specific and development-stage-specific expression, which are thought to regulate almost every biological process. It has been estimated that more than one-third of human genes could be controlled by microRNAs [19]. MiRNA-mediated repression often requires perfect base pairing of the miRNA seed region (nt 2\u20137 from the miRNA 5\u2032-end) to the 3\u2032-UTR of an mRNA target sequence [18], [19]. Both miRNAs and their 3\u2032-UTR binding sites are evolutionarily conserved in many cases. Thus far, functional C-type lectin expression has not been linked to miRNA regulation.

The 7-nt sequence UUUGUGA on this site was fully conserved among porcine, bovine and ovine CLEC4Gs as well as two equine homologues CLEC4G1 and 3 (Fig. 4b).

Although the miR-350 homologues in pig, cattle, sheep and horse have not been available from miRBase, they likely will have the identical sequence due to the evolutionary conservation. Interestingly, an 8-nt sequence AACUGGAA at the same position in hCLEC4G and chimpanzee CLEC4G mRNA was also targeted by a human miRNA hsa-miR-145 and a chimpanzee ptr-miR-145, respectively. This unique sequence was shared by equine CLEC4G2 but not the other primate pseudogenes (Fig. 4b). We did not identify any specific miRNAs recognizing the same site in rodent or non-placental CLEC4G members, probably due to the limiting data of miRNAs for these species available from miRBase (data not shown). The computer-based identification of a position-conserved and multi-species-conserved miRNA target sequence in CLEC4G members from domesticated animals and primates should provide some insights for the study of potential miRNA-mediated regulation of CLEC4G in the future.",

Sequence analysis showed the expected size (889 bp) and nucleotide sequence identical to the putative 10 exons (exons 2\u201311) of pCD23 in the clone CH242-334A8 (data not shown), which indeed encodes a C-type lectin homologous to bovine and human CD23.

            "text": "When the coding region of pCLEC4G cDNA from pig liver was amplified, we observed the possible processing of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA characterized by the appearance of a series of high-molecular-weight PCR fragments in addition to the expected mature mRNA (Fig. 1a). Each of these high-molecular weight PCR fragments was excised and cloned to determine the respective sequence. The sequencing results showed that these transcripts were actually splicing intermediate products of pCLEC4G mRNA precursors with the sizes of 1707, 1491, 1381 and 1176 bp, respectively. These intermediate splicing products retained various introns compared to the pCLEC4G gene (2721 bp). Based on the intron removals of these splicing intermediate products, we proposed a temporal order of the splicing pathway of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA (Fig. 7\n). First, introns A, E, G and H are to be removed either simultaneously or in an order that could not be predicted from the RT-PCR result to yield an intermediate product of 1707 bp, leading to the integrities of the CRD encoded by the last three exons as well as the CT encoded by the first two exons. Further processing of the 1707-bp intermediate results in a 1491-bp pre-mRNA by splicing of the intron F. Subsequent removal of the intron D yields an mRNA that is 1381 bp. Intron C appears to be spliced at this point to yield the 1176-bp pre-mRNA that retains only the intron B. The mature pCLEC4G mRNA, detected as a 909-bp product, is produced by the removal of the intron B. The processing of pCLEC4G exons encoding the neck region appears to follow a strictly temporal and positional order by splicing of the relevant introns one-by-one, from the 3 prime exon E to the 5 prime exon B. Furthermore, exon 2 is removed from the mature mRNA product to yield an 807-bp isoform lacking the TMD. Alternatively, since the exon 2 and intron B are linked together, the isoform may be generated by simultaneous splicing of them from the 1176-bp pre-mRNA (Fig. 7).",

            "text": "We proposed this temporal order of the splicing pathway based upon the fact that the amounts of the splicing intermediate products reached to the level that could be detectable by RT-PCR, thus indicating that they represent the majority in all the intermediate products. It should be noted that the RT-PCR detection was done in liver, which may accurately reflect the processing pathways of these pre-mRNAs in vivo. It will be interesting to see whether the processing of the exons encoding CRD and CT domain prior to the TMD and neck region observed here could also be present in other C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. The known DC-SIGN/L-SIGN mRNA as well as the hCLEC4G isoforms identified so far exist as TMD-lacking or partial-tandem-neck-repeats-lacking variants due to the skipping of the exon encoding the TMD and/or the presence of cryptic splicing sites on the exon encoding the neck region [10], [20]. This may be linked to the temporal order of the splicing in that different patterns of aberrant splicing occur during the later splicing events. Moreover, the variant neck-region tandem repeats of L-SIGN have been associated with the susceptibility of several infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV, HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[21]. Other factors including the quality of the donor and acceptor sites, splice enhancers or suppressors, the RNA secondary structures or the size of introns and exons may also contribute to controlling the order of intron removal [22], [23], [24]. The identification of sequential splicing intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA in vivo may provide a good model to study how the splicing machinery selects the correct pairs of splice sites to ensure the orderly intron removal in C-type lectins, and whether these could be linked to the interactions with the pathogens.",

The blue-violet boxes above the plots represent the nine exons of the pCLEC4G gene. The peaks in the same color indicate conserved regions within exons while the peaks in pink color denote conserved regions within introns. The cutoff value of percent identity is set to 70%. The human and chimpanzee CLEC4G pseudogenes lost their protein-coding ability due to a point mutation (G to A) at the proposed start codon.
