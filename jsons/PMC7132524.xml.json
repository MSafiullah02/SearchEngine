In today's world with its global reach, the potential for the spread of foodborne illness across country and continental barriers is immense. Worldwide, Norovirus (NoV) is the leading agent of acute gastroenteritis (Table 1), causing about 1 in 5 cases in developed countries (CDC, 2016). In countries where rotavirus vaccines are implemented, NoV has surpassed rotaviruses as the most common cause of childhood gastroenteritis requiring medical attention (Payne et al., 2013).",

Restaurants were the most common setting for these outbreaks with the majority of these attributed to infected food handlers (70%). It is interesting to note that of the 324 outbreaks where a food item was identified only 67 outbreaks reported contamination linked to a single category of food (Hall et al., 2014). The most common categories of food linked to outbreaks were leafy greens, fresh fruit and shellfish. However, any food can be implicated in outbreaks. Contaminated raw ingredients or fresh produce can be sourced from very distant locations and used as ingredients in a wide variety of foods, thereby increasing the potential for spread of infection and impact of illness across the food industry. In 2012, frozen berries \u2013 specifically strawberries \u2013 were implicated in large-scale outbreaks of NoV and Hepatitis A virus (HAV). During a 2-month span in 2012, approximately 11,000 people in Germany were affected by NoV gastroenteritis. Epidemiological investigations found that frozen strawberries imported from China were the vehicle of contamination (M\u00e4de et al., 2013) while HAV in frozen mixed berries from various countries (Canada, Bulgaria, Serbia and Poland) was linked to an increase in cases in Northern Italy (Rizzo et al., 2013).",

In this study, five pathogens, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, and NoV, accounted for approximately 90% of the total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with NoV alone contributing 5000 lost QALYs. This translates into a cost of approximately $2 billion per year due to NoV (Hoffmann et al., 2012), while studies in the Netherlands reported the costs of NoV and HAV illnesses in 2012 to be around \u20ac106 million and \u20ac900,000, respectively (Mangen et al., 2013, Mangen et al., 2015).",

However, given a virus' main route of transmission, its presence typically suggests that fecal contamination has occurred somewhere along the supply chain from farm to fork. This has left regulators and industry alike wondering how best to respond and react to positive findings (Stals et al., 2013). The recent NoV infectivity assay developed by Ettayebi et al. (2016) will by no means be employed on a routine basis, but the assay gives the possibility to determine the threshold of NoV genome copies that may pose a health threat. All stakeholders in the food industry agree that control measures for viruses throughout the food chain are required. However, much still needs to be understood with regards to the effectiveness of these controls and proper validation of their performance, whether it is the personal hygiene of food handlers, processing on of at risk foods or the interpretation and action on a positive test result in a virus testing program (ACMSF, 2015; EFSA, 2011).",

Although any virus able to cause disease after ingestion could be potentially considered foodborne and/or waterborne, in practice most reported viral foodborne illnesses are gastroenteritis or hepatitis, caused by human NoV and HAV, respectively. However, other viral agents such as enteroviruses, sapoviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses, and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been implicated in food- and/or water-borne transmission of illness. Extremely high numbers of viruses may be shed in stools of patients suffering from gastroenteritis (inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract) or hepatitis, who may excrete up to 1013 and 1010 virus particles, respectively, per gram of stool (Costafreda et al., 2006; Ozawa et al., 2007; Caballero et al., 2013). The symptoms of viral gastroenteritis include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and occasionally fever and headache (Arness et al., 2000). While bacterial gastroenteritis agents are usually responsible for the most severe cases, viruses such as NoV, are responsible for the largest number of cases (Hall et al., 2014).",

Additionally, the presence or absence of bacterial fecal indicators in food, such as E. coli, has proven to be unreliable to indicate presence of enteric viruses (Borchardt et al., 2003; Pint\u00f3 et al., 2009; Galovi\u0107 et al., 2016). In the absence of reliable indicators, the presence of viruses in food is detected using methods which are currently based on detection of viral nucleic acids that do not indicate viral infectivity (Li et al., 2015). This creates issues in interpreting results for risk assessments as it is difficult to correlate viral nucleic acid detection to likelihood of causing disease.",

However, current estimates suggest an infective dose in a range between 15 and 1300 genome copies or 1\u201310 virus particles (Teunis et al., 2008; Atmar et al., 2014). The figure is further supported by studies on oyster-related outbreaks where very low virus concentrations were linked to probability of infections with NoV (Thebault et al., 2013). Similarly, the risk of infection due to HAV in shellfish has been investigated using outbreaks and the vehicles which caused them. Pint\u00f3 et al. (2009) studied if the number of viral particles (viral nucleic acids) with genome copies of 10\u2013100 genomic copies/g could be correlated with risk of infection. However, it is uncertain if recovery of genome copies during sample processing was 100%, or if there is a fixed relationship between genome copies and infectious units (Pint\u00f3 et al., 2009). Based on these studies it is inferred that low doses of either NoV or HAV are capable of causing disease in humans.",

In fresh produce for example, foodborne viruses were found to survive longer than the shelf-life of the products (Li et al., 2015) and in shellfish, enteric viruses are known to persist for several weeks or months (Drouaz et al., 2015). Survival of enteric viruses has been demonstrated on different household and industrial surfaces where HAV was found to be more resistant to desiccation than other enteric viruses (Abad et al., 1994). Finally, transfer rates have been studied experimentally, identifying variables that have a major influence on transmission as reviewed by Li et al. (2015). The transfer rates for MNV were shown to decrease after drying or after multiple transfers (Tuladhar et al., 2013). While this information is useful as an approximation for survival of HuNoV, it also points to one of the major gaps in understanding virus behavior, where there are limitations in working with and culturing a number of important pathogenic foodborne viruses. The reliance on surrogates, such as MNV, in survival and transmission studies and the reliance on outbreak data to determine infective dose, create uncertainty in risk assessment studies for viruses. However, this may change in the near future with the successful culturing of a number of enteric viruses.",

            "text": "Importantly, viruses are often unevenly distributed in a batch of food, making it necessary to test replicates or a pool of samples to obtain the most reliable qualitative or quantitative results (Le Guyader et al., 2010; M\u00fcller et al., 2015). Presently, there are no regulatory microbiological criteria (e.g. standards, guidelines or specifications) applied relating to viruses. Most food companies and authorities mainly ask for qualitative results as part of production hygiene testing or outbreak investigations (M\u00fcller et al., 2015). For confirmation of a positive qRT-PCR signal and to assist epidemiological studies, systematic typing of strains linked to disease outbreaks and surveillance of viruses in food commodities is recommended (EFSA, 2011). As the short (~100 bp) amplicon from standard RT-qPCRs is not suitable for strain typing, current protocols include conventional RT-PCRs targeting a longer and more variable region for sequencing (Mattison et al., 2009; Siebenga et al., 2009; P\u00e9rez-Sautu et al., 2011; Vinj\u00e9 et al., 2004). As strains may cluster differently depending on the regions used for phylogeny, sequencing regions should preferably include potential recombination sites (Vinj\u00e9 et al., 2004; Symes et al., 2007; Mattison et al., 2009; Siebenga et al., 2009; Bull and White, 2011). However, as repeatedly reported from outbreak investigations, it is difficult to obtain a useful sequence from positive RT-qPCR food samples (Sarvikivi et al., 2012). This may be due to a lack of recognition by the conventional primers, simultaneous amplification of multiple strains, the amount of virus being below the detection limit for conventional RT-PCR or extraction of insufficiently pure RNA to get amplification suitable for sequencing. All of these reasons may explain a Belgian, French and Canadian screening study where only 34.6% of positive samples, were confirmed by systematic typing using RT-PCR and sequencing (Baert et al., 2011).",

As viruses need an intact capsid to be infective, studies have been performed to achieve detection of RNA only from these intact viral particles. RNAse or propidium monoazide treatments may be used, as successfully demonstrated on HAV subjected to thermal inactivation (Topping et al., 2009; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2012). However, such approaches have to be adapted depending on the virus and treatment applied (Escudero-Abarca et al., 2014). In addition, suppression of inactivated virus signals may not be complete, which may lead to an overestimation of infectious viruses (Moreno et al., 2015). Since the methods rely on the ability of propidium monoazide and RNAse to penetrate damaged or destroyed capsids, viruses inactivated by interventions or processes that do not reduce or destroy capsid integrity, e.g. those targeting nucleic acids directly, cannot be studied by such approaches.",

Recently, the replication of a GII.4 Sydney NoV strain was achieved in B-cells in the presence of histo-blood group antigens expressing enteric bacteria (Jones et al., 2014, Jones et al., 2015). Human intestinal enteroids allowed cultivation of several strains of NoV showing an increase of up to 3 log10 for some strains (Ettayebi et al., 2016). This enteroid system, already successfully applied in several laboratories, will help to identify, qualify and investigate correlations with appropriate surrogates that behave similarly to NoV, allowing the food industry to use these surrogates to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies.",

The application of next generation sequencing to viral genomes will not only contribute to viral identification but also provide new data that will improve primer and probe design for targeted PCR assays. In the near future, identification of the virome in clinical and environmental samples will also be helpful in analysis of food samples, as well as, improving knowledge on any relationships between bacterial and viral contamination (Kohl et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2015; Newton et al., 2015).",

            "text": "To assess risks associated with viruses and other hazards in the food chain and put in place appropriate control measures, the use of risk assessment techniques has been suggested by international bodies (Codex Alimentarius, 1995; WTO, 1995) and increasingly accepted by governments around the world as a basis for national legislation in relation to food safety (European Commission, 2002; Dong et al., 2015). There are two main approaches in performing a risk assessment, an epidemiological approach (top-down approach) starting from data on illness and moving towards the hazard in the product and a food chain approach (bottom-up approach) starting from the hazard in the product and moving towards an estimate of the probability of illness (Zwietering and Van Gerwen, 2000). Risk assessments can also be quantitative, when models are used to link the different risk assessment components resulting in a numerical quantification of the risk or qualitative when no models are used (Nauta, 2000). Finally, depending on the type of risk estimate, risk assessments may be deterministic (point estimates) or stochastic (probabilistic estimates incorporating the uncertainty and or variability associated with different types of input data) (Lammerding and Fazil, 2000). The following sections provide an overview of existing top-down/bottom-up risk assessments focusing on viruses and discuss how risk assessment findings can be used to reduce the public health burden of food related viral illnesses.",

            "text": "Most published risk assessments consider enteric viruses present in water (irrigation or drinking water) while fewer studies have examined viruses present in food products. An overview of waterborne fresh produce risk assessments can be found in the publication by de Keuckelaere et al. (2015) and an overview of bottom-up foodborne risk assessments can be seen in Table 4\nof this paper. For irrigation water, most risk assessments deal with rotavirus and other human enteric viruses (de Keuckelaere et al., 2015) while for food a wide variety of viruses and products are considered. NoV or HAV are dealt with in several of these risk assessments (Bouwknegt et al., 2015; Pint\u00f3 et al., 2009; Jacxsens et al., 2017; Kokkinos et al., 2015; Masago et al., 2006; Sumner, 2011) as the viruses seem to be most commonly transmitted through food and water (Koopmans and Duizer, 2002; Lopman, 2015). While avian influenza viruses are not necessarily pathogenic to humans their spread through various food commodities are also the focus of several risk assessments (Golden et al., 2009; M\u00e9tras et al., 2009; Bauer et al., 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2010) following the attention given to this illness as a pre-eminent zoonosis, although foodborne transmission remains controversial. Despite the lack of data on prevalence, concentration and dose-response modelling for foodborne viruses, it is often possible to perform a quantitative risk assessment, but assumptions need to be made. For instance, in the absence of a cell culture based method for detection, the concentration of viruses in samples are often estimated by RT-qPCR in number of genome copies or PCR-detectable genome units/g of product and sometimes in combination with the MPN test (Bouwknegt et al., 2015; Pint\u00f3 et al., 2009; Masago et al., 2006). Similarly, feeding trial data from other viruses after applying correction factors (Pint\u00f3 et al., 2009) or from a specific virus strain (Bouwknegt et al., 2015), or simply an assumption on a threshold dose (M\u00fcller et al., 2017), may form the basis of the dose response models. Alternatively, in the absence of a specific dose-response model, an estimation of the number of exposures may be the final step of the risk assessment process (Sarno et al., 2017). Overall, this shows that the lack of data is not necessarily a barrier to performing a quantitative risk assessment (Coleman and Marks, 1999).",

            "text": "Risk factor studies have been conducted by examining global epidemiological trends in human NoV outbreaks by transmission route, season and setting. The results demonstrated that foodservice and winter outbreaks were significantly associated with higher attack rates (Verhoef et al., 2015). Foodborne and waterborne outbreaks were associated with multiple strains (GI + GII). Waterborne outbreaks were significantly associated with GI strains, while healthcare-related and winter outbreaks were associated with GII strains. These results identify important trends for epidemic NoV detection, prevention, and control (Matthews et al., 2012). In addition, a study was performed in Denmark to clarify routes of contamination (Franck et al., 2015). The authors reviewed and categorized 191 calicivirus (189 NoV and 2 sapovirus) outbreaks occurring in Denmark from 2005 to 2011 according to the source of contamination. The review revealed that in 51 (27%) outbreaks, contamination had occurred during production, with frozen berries, lettuce and oysters being the most commonly implicated food products. It was concluded that another 55 (29%) outbreaks had occurred after guests had contaminated the food at self-serve buffets. Contamination from food handlers took place during the preparation or serving of the food in 64 (34%) of the outbreaks of which 41 (64%) (one of five outbreaks) were caused by asymptomatic food handlers \u2013 who either had contact with ill household members, or retrospectively were found to be in the incubation- or recovery period at the time of handling the food. Data from contamination studies show that >1000 virus particles may be transferred from fecally-contaminated fingers to foods, so inactivation of at least 3 log10 would be required to inactivate these agents (Koopmans and Duizer, 2002) and emphasizes the importance of hygienic handling prior to processing. For such reasons, guidelines (Codex Alimentarius, 2012) have been written to help food authorities and the industry to manage sick leaves in cases of ill food handlers, in order to limit the transmission of viruses through food handling operations.",

Identified interventions may vary depending on the type of risk assessment performed. Thus, food chain risk assessments provide more information on interventions targeted to processing/consumer practices. Epidemiological risk assessments facilitate interventions that can be deduced from studies about risk factors, implicated vehicles in outbreaks and high-risk product-pathogen combinations. A summary of the most important interventions for the control of viruses in the food chain could be setting adequate criteria for decimal reduction for viruses (may not be suitable for all foods) e.g. achieving a core temperature of 85\u201390 \u00b0C for at least 1.5 min has been considered a virucidal treatment (CAC, 2012). Implementing raw material/food production controls (oysters, berries, leafy greens) e.g. harvesting oysters and other shellfish from non-contaminated areas, establishing an acceptable limit for NoV in oysters to be harvested and placed in the market, and testing of products for compliance to this acceptable limit (EFSA, 2012) are examples of theses controls. Appropriate farm to fork implementation of food safety management systems (GAP, GHP, GMP) accompanied by suitable validation and verification procedures are primary mitigation options for reducing risk of NoV in berries and leafy greens (EFSA 2014a, EFSA 2014b). Improved/increased surveillance of high risk food commodities, e.g. soft fruits (European Commission, 2012) and adequate hand hygiene and food handling education along with effective sanitation measures, strategies to manage ill workers, and provisions for a suitable period sickness/absence leave in the case of symptomatic food handlers or asymptomatic food handlers whose household members suffer from gastroenteritis (Franck et al., 2015) are options to manage risks.",

The replication assay recently developed for certain human NoV strains will allow more realistic evaluation and validation studies for viruses (Ettayebi et al., 2016). However, at present, the most common approach has been to use cultivable surrogate viruses such as FCV (Hoover and Kahn, 1975), MNV (Karst et al., 2003), TuV (Farkas et al., 2008) and bacteriophages such as MS2 (Maillard et al., 1994; Shin and Sobsey, 2003; Dawson et al., 2005) to mimic human NoV. Wild type HAV and HEV strains cannot be easily cultured in the laboratory. As alternative a cultivable laboratory adapted HAV HM-175 strain (Daemer et al., 1981) and a recently developed HEV cell culture method (Johne et al., 2016) are commonly used in studies. An ideal surrogate for human NoV should have similar biological, biochemical and biophysical characteristics as human NoV (Baker et al., 2012), and members of the same Caliciviridae family are logical surrogate choices. However, even enteric viruses within the same family could have different characteristics and the interpretation of the results from experiments using surrogates is challenging, because of differences in cultivation, detection and analytical methods. Moreover, variations in challenge study designs also complicates interpretation and comparison between studies.",

The regulation of pH (by fermentation or addition of acid) and aw levels (by drying or using solutes such as salt/sugar), combined with various storage conditions can have variable effects on different viruses (Table 5\n). MNV and TuV have demonstrated tolerance to a low pH (pH 2 for 1 h; Li et al., 2013), produced by lactic acid bacteria. Fermentation may produce antiviral properties and compounds could potentially be used as food additives (Al Kassaa et al., 2014), but the modes of action of these compounds are not well understood.",

The inactivation of viruses treated with extracts from grape seeds, cranberries, mulberries, black raspberries and pomegranates using varying conditions including test substrate concentrations, temperatures and duration have been demonstrated (Table 6\n). Generally, the inactivation of both NoV surrogates and HAV was dependent on exposure time and test compound concentrations. The main effect of extracts from grape seeds on FCV, MNV and HAV seemed to be reduced virus adsorption to cells (Su et al., 2011). A similar effect was reported for black raspberry seed extracts on FCV and MNV and with some indication of inhibition of MNV replication (Lee et al., 2016). Lemongrass oil, citral and allspice oil gave a time dependent reduction of MNV in PBS, resulting in 2.7, 3.0, and 3.4 log10 reduction after 24 h, respectively. Spice oil is reported to affect the capsid and RNA directly, while lemongrass oil and citral appeared to reduce virus infectivity by coating the capsid (Gilling et al., 2014b).",

Saponin (1.0 \u03bcg/ml) had inhibitory effects on rotavirus by blocking attachment to host cells (Roner et al., 2010). An effect of citric acid was observed as binding of human NoVs to histo-blood group antigens (HBGA), which are considered as co-receptors for these viruses, was blocked (Hansman et al., 2012). Milk proteins may interfere with virus infection, e.g. lactoferrin blocks rotavirus (Wakabayashi et al., 2014), FCV and PV (McCann et al., 2003; McCall et al., 2011) entry into the cell. Tryptic digest of lactoferrin or acylation and amidation of lactoferrin (Pan et al., 2007) and modification of other natural biochemicals may enhance antiviral properties and detailed in a review of antiviral properties of milk proteins and peptides by Pan et al. (2006). Essential oils (EO) containing terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and esters extracted from plants e.g. extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa showed 5.0 log10 reduction of MNV and HAV (Joshi et al., 2015). However, inactivation mechanisms remain unknown. A number of studies have reported the effect of EO and biochemicals on virus infectivity (Table 7\n) but despite the reports of efficacy demonstrated in in-vitro studies, there has been very limited application of these findings to date. One of the major hurdles in successful application is ensuring the antiviral compounds are present at the necessary virucidal concentrations wherever the viruses are present in a food. Due to the low infective dose of foodborne viruses, any intervention techniques acting alone would need to completely inactivate any viruses present in a food. In addition, there may be other factors present in foods that may interfere with antiviral effects.",

At lower temperatures like those typically used for pasteurization, both HAV and MNV showed inactivation rates >3.5 log10 after 1 min at 72 \u00b0C in water (Hewitt et al., 2009). Similarly, Hirneisen and Kniel (2013) reported heating at 70 \u00b0C for 2 min inactivated MNV and TuV beyond the limit of detection and that NoV surrogates could behave similarly during heat treatment. D-values for NoV surrogates and HAV can vary depending on the heating system used (Arthur and Gibson, 2015; Bozkurt et al., 2015) with MNV showing similar D-values at 72 \u00b0C in cell culture medium, spinach and seafood, and HAV appeared to be better protected by the seafood matrix with D-values of 0.88 and 1.07 min at 72 \u00b0C for HAV in cell culture medium and mussels, respectively, but no formal statistical comparison was reported (Bozkurt and D'Souza, 2014; Bozkurt et al., 2014; Bozkurt et al., 2015).

Most viruses are far more resistant to irradiation (Table 10\n) than vegetative bacteria, parasites, and fungi which may be due to their smaller size and even smaller genome size (often single-stranded RNA) (Farkas, 1998). Two major irradiation technologies, gamma irradiation and electron beam (E-beam) that use high-energy electrons have been explored. A maximum absorbed dose allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 4.0 kGy (FDA, 2007), while in Europe the maximum allowed dose is 10.0 kGy (EFSA, 2011). Doses permitted by international regulatory agencies vary depending on the type of food. However, the US FDA approved dose of 4 kGy is likely to achieve approximately 1.0 log10 viral reduction and higher doses will be required to achieve higher viral reductions in most foods. Exposure to 8 kGy of gamma irradiation of a human NoV GII.3 and GII.4 stool suspension inactivates the viruses, as demonstrated using the stem cell derived human enteroids assay (Ettayebi et al., 2016). Considering work carried out using surrogates, MNV appears to be more resistant than TuV when treated with E-beam (Predmore et al., 2015).",

PL or UV may be used in combination with other control strategies (e.g. chlorine) resulting in synergistic benefits that could lead to increased UV induced viral genome damage (Rattanakul et al., 2015). However, the effectiveness of light based technologies is limited to certain types of liquids or surface decontamination. Various food characteristics such as turbidity of the liquid medium can affect UV or PL penetration and slower flow rates used to extend exposure times for better UV or PL efficacy may not be realistic. Successful application of this technology relies on the light reaching all the virus particles directly and if the viruses are present in cracks, crevices or openings in the surface of the food or surfaces, the viruses may be shielded from exposure to the light and will therefore survive.",

With some produce types, the sanitizer may not penetrate cracks, crevices and openings and the protective waxy cuticle could act as a barrier while exudates from leafy green vegetables may allow viruses to attach and locate near pores or stomata thereby reducing sanitizer effectiveness due to reduced accessibility (Takeuchi and Frank, 2000). Incorporating a surfactant to remove the waxy layer on certain fresh produce can increase the efficacy of the sanitizer (Predmore and Li, 2011) and incorporating physical methods e.g. high power ultrasound can be used to dislodge viruses on the surface and improve sanitizer-produce interaction (Liu et al., 2009; Maks et al., 2009).",

However, the choice of surrogate and its preparation, treatment time, inoculation methods and time allowed for inoculum to attach to product and differences in analytical methods could have significant impact on observed reduction data (Knight et al., 2016). Hence, a standardized or harmonized method for evaluating decontamination strategies for foods would be very useful (Table 13\n). In the absence of a large scale and widely available cultivable human NoV assay, evaluation and validation of antivirals and processes are commonly performed using a cultivable surrogate. It is yet unclear if inactivation data obtained through the use of surrogates are representative for human NoV. Additionally, variations in surrogate inactivation levels have been documented. Even if inactivation of a surrogate and a human NoV strain is correlated, the resistance of other human NoV strains is unknown. A surrogate for HEV is also needed, as validation is currently not possible and inactivation is difficult to assess due to the need of an animal model (swine bioassay). However, using newly established cell culture methods, comparisons with surrogates should be possible (Ettayebi et al., 2016; Johne et al., 2016). Similarly, identified surrogates need to be cultured to high titers for industry pilot-scale trials in order to establish process validity along with simple rapid methods for reliable detection and quantitation. The use of virus-like particles may be an alternate choice with the added bonus of enabling their use in scenarios where actual viruses cannot be introduced for safety reasons (Crawford et al., 1994; Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2002). The NoV culture method (Ettayebi et al., 2016) is a significant advancement for NoV research. However, quantification of inactivation levels above 3.0 log10 delivered by most processing technologies may be difficult to evaluate.",

However, virus behavior is very type-specific and thus, there is a need to identify a large number of surrogates and improve detection methods to allow quantification following application of control measures. A recent review of NoV even suggested discontinuing all surrogate studies unless direct comparison between surrogate and NoV inactivation kinetics is established (Cook et al., 2016).

The implementation of most control measures can be improved with a focus on training, supplier controls during processing and on intervention strategies in case of outbreaks (e.g. specific cleaning techniques). Training should focus on changing food handler and consumer habits, and creating a food safety culture, with awareness of effective hygiene measures (e.g. proper hand washing). Additionally, communication of gastrointestinal illness and how to contain the spread of infections e.g. by staying at home for a minimum number of days following gastrointestinal illness (currently 2\u20133 days according to a recommendation by Food Standards Agency UK), can help in preventing NoV transmission. Proper hand washing and strict compliance of hygienic measures are essential and still among the best control measures in preventing foodborne virus transmission by food handlers. In addition, when available, vaccination of food handlers e.g. HAV vaccination is recommended.",

However, some of the questions raised at the beginning remain unanswered, like the relationship between detected genome copies and infective virus particles. New knowledge has led to a more critical view, e.g. looking at equivalence in behavior when comparing target viruses and surrogates. New insights have raised more concern on whether usage of surrogates allows for any correlation with respect to the behavior of target viruses. The difficulty of cultivating viruses and reliable methods for their detection at low levels are currently major factors to be addressed in order to allow further, more in depth research in all other areas. To make the best use of all data available, it is important that we explore the benefits of various risk assessment approaches to understand virus behavior. This insight can then be used to develop adequate control measures. In conclusion, effective tools and technologies to ensure control of viruses in the food chain can significantly reduce foodborne infections caused by viruses.",
