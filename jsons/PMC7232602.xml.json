The underlying mechanisms leading to hemostatic problems following TBI are complex involving factors which can either separately or synergistically impair components of the coagulation system leading to platelet dysfunction and increased fibrinolysis [14, 23, 32, 42, 51, 57]. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the detailed pathophysiology of coagulation pathway disturbance following TBI remains poorly understood [23, 57].",

In later decades, the cutaneous \u201cvenostasis\u201d bleeding time technique was modified, standardized, and popularized by Ivy and others [2, 17, 18, 22]. The most common indications for the application of the IVY bleeding time test is the preoperative investigation of platelet function and primary hemostasis [4, 9, 13, 39]. Due to poor sensitivity and specificity and standardization problems of the IVY test, there is controversy regarding its efficacy to predict bleeding risk [4, 9, 24, 37]. However, it remains in use in many clinical practices including our neurosurgical department after the implementation of a carefully standardized testing protocol [28, 32, 38, 48]. It should also be noted that studies reporting controversial results regarding the IVY method did not include neurosurgical patient cohorts [4, 24, 37].",

For inclusion, the patients needed to meet the following criteria: (1) moderate TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores 9\u201313) or severe TBI (GCS \u2264 8), (2) admitted to the neurointensive care unit (NICU) from January 2008 to December 2016, (3) \u2265 18 years old, (4) indications of known history of chronic alcohol abuse from the patients\u2019 records and ICD codes, (5) bleeding time according to the IVY test performed. The exclusion criteria were the following: (1) multitrauma that may have influenced coagulation mechanisms (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 16), (2) marked preexisting or observed coagulation abnormalities such as international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.4 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 42 s and innate problems such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease, (3) patients on antiplatelet medication. Subjects with marked liver dysfunction reflected by prolonged hematologic parameters and liver function tests as well as bone marrow dysfunction were also not included in our study sample. The reference rates for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in our laboratory are 26\u201342 s. A control group with data from 121 patients from 2008 to 2012 including other TBI patients evaluated by the IVY test was also included and compared. Multitrauma cases with marked coagulation disturbances (such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease), those on antiplatelet medication, patients with preexisting significant coagulopathies, and patients with AUD were excluded. A small number of patients were on anticoagulants (n = 6) but those with INR > 1.4 and PTT > 42 s were not included in the cohort.",

The level of consciousness on admission and at deterioration (if any) was evaluated with the use of the GCS score [47]. Deterioration was defined as any worsening in the neurological status during the initial period of hospitalization. All patients underwent repeat computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, determined on individual clinical decisions. The CT scan findings classified the injury as focal or diffuse based on their dominant radiological characteristics [31]. CT scans were also screened during hospitalization to determine possible increase in hematoma size, midline shift, and ventricle size [31]. Changes in hematoma size (increase or decrease) during hospitalization were determined based on the radiology report and personal observations. Any increase in the midline shift was defined as the displacement of the septum pellucidum in relation to the midline in millimeters [19]. Surgical data with an emphasis on the need for decompressive surgery (hematoma removal and/or craniectomy) or non-decompressive surgery (intraparenchymal or intraventricular measurement of intracranial pressure) were also documented. Information on the history of AUD was extracted from the patient archives.",

Next, a sterile blood lancet performs a shallow intradermal incision over the bend of the supinated forearm. Every 30 s, a filter paper is used to gently absorb the blood and check for hemostasis. The time period from skin incision until the bleeding has stopped is measured. In our laboratory, regardless of the underlying diagnosis and pathology, and in the general population, values < 600 s are considered normal, values of 600\u2013900 s prolonged, and values \u2265 900 s markedly prolonged which is also the time point when the examiner stops the testing.

Unconscious patients were mechanically ventilated with monitoring of the ICP. ICP was monitored in unconscious patients with either intraventricular drainage catheter or intraparenchymal probes. Decompressive craniectomy was the last-tier treatment choice. A combination of intermittent intravenous morphine and continuous intravenous propofol infusion was given for analgesia and sedation. Arterial blood gases and blood glucose levels were also monitored. The treatment goals were an ICP of \u2264 20 mmHg and a CPP of \u2265 60 mmHg [7]. In case of substantially prolonged IVY bleeding time, no ICP device was initially inserted and frequent wake-up tests were performed to detect any deterioration [29].

However, its relevance has been repeatedly questioned in recent years. Numerous reports have stated that this test does not reflect hemostasis in other areas, it is poorly reproducible, and there are difficulties in standardization; it may be normal in patients with known bleeding tendency as well as in patients on antiplatelet medication, or abnormal in individuals with a negative history of coagulation problems [13, 20, 24, 52]. Moreover, it can be time consuming for the staff conducting the test. It has also been stated that even normal bleeding time values cannot reliably exclude patients prone to bleeding in surgery, emphasizing the importance of a careful and detailed bleeding history [5, 24, 37]. Nevertheless, mainly due to its simplicity and natural results, there are centers still using the bleeding test as a screening tool in patients prone to bleeding either preoperatively or during hospitalization, especially when more specialized tests are unavailable, expensive, or time consuming. Moreover, there is paucity of data on the use of the bleeding test in neurosurgical patients.",

In addition to an increase in hematoma size, more patients required ICP monitoring and mechanical ventilation. Regarding ICP monitoring in patients with severe coagulation problems, insertion of ICP catheter is postponed until the coagulation status is sufficiently improved. However, in the current cohort, this was only partially true since only 28.6% of patients with bleeding time > 900 s received ICP monitoring later than 24 h from injury. When the two groups were compared, no difference either in the need for decompressive surgery or reoperation was noted. More patients with thrombocytopenia were included in the > 900s bleeding time group, but this difference was not statistically significant.

Noticeably, only one patient had platelet count below 50,000/\u03bcL and in total, 11/52 had platelet count below 100,000/\u03bcL, representing thus a minor percentage of our study cohort and an insufficient number to compare with.",

It was found that bleeding time in TBI patients was significantly prolonged compared with that in the other groups. In the same study, platelet count was similar in TBI patients and alcoholics [32]. Diagnosis and treatment of platelet dysfunction using platelet transfusion, platelet-stimulating drugs, or no treatment remain controversial in TBI. According to the current findings, AUD subjects had more prolonged values compared with those with no history of AUD.

The current study mainly investigated the potential added value of IVY bleeding time test when other coagulation abnormalities were in the normal range. Pathological INR and aPTT values would confuse the present findings and therefore, the conclusions on the value of the IVY bleeding time test. Moreover, these more specialized coagulation tests may provide more accurate data but also have their limitations (financial costs, sometimes time consuming, are not available in all hospitals); frequently, they cannot be done on a non-regular basis (during the night, weekends, etc.), and their interpretation requires special knowledge and training in the field compared with the easy interpreted results of bleeding time [26, 56]. Moreover, when compared with the common diagnostic tools (INR, PT, aPTT), fibrinolysis methods can be sometimes more cumbersome and less standardized [56]. Lastly, it can be postulated that alcohol may influence viscoelastic method parameters, possibly acting on platelets and especially in trauma patients [16].",

            "text": "Naturally, there is an association between platelet count and bleeding time. However, in the present study, this correlation was weak, since 46% of patients with prolonged bleeding time had platelet counts above 150,000/\u03bcL and 26% with normal bleeding time had low platelet counts. Following brain trauma, the bleeding time and other platelet functional tests may be prolonged, permanently or temporary, for some time secondary to the injury and irrespective of a normal platelet count. Whether this is due to a direct \u201cplatelet shock\u201d by the brain trauma or secondary to other coagulation pathology, it remains debated. The different prevalence of a long bleeding time between the control and the AUD group can be related to multiple factors such as alcohol misuse, trauma severity, initial taking care, or medication, although this is difficult to state and is something which remains to be validated. The present findings can stimulate further studies to investigate whether dysfunctional platelets are of direct importance and not just an association with the outcome in TBI patients and if platelet transfusion can have a different effect (either positive or negative) on congenital platelet dysfunction or drug-induced platelet inhibition than in TBI.",

When a patient presents with a clearly elevated INR at 1.5 or higher, the IVY test would not routinely be employed in our department, in view of other important measures used to correct such coagulopathy (such as prothrombin complex concentrates). Regarding INR and TBI, although we acknowledge the fact that many recommend values > 1.2 as a limit for warfarin reversal, others suggest a target value of INR < 1.5 in cases with a positive CT scan [54]. Moreover, in surgical candidates, as TBI patients frequently are, an INR value of 1.5 or lower is commonly considered a limit where surgery can proceed safely [50, 54]. Of note, in the current study, no patient had an INR \u2265 1.5, only two had an INR of 1.4, and two had an INR of 1.3 on initial testing, representing thus a small percentage of the total cohort.",

Information on the history of AUD was extracted from the patient archives and ICD codes, and no strict criteria or dedicated questionnaires could be applied mainly because of their critical condition. There was no available information on blood ethanol levels at the time of injury. Detailed clinical data and management data were in some occasions incomplete. Specialized coagulation tests to confirm or rule out bleeding tendency and tests to evaluate platelet function were typically not carried out. Since IVY has been used in a standardized way for a long time and performed by well-trained and experienced personnel in our unit with minor problems, we believe the commonly described variability of the IVY method in our unit is very limited. The exact time frame from injury to subjection to the IVY bleeding time test was not available for every individual. However, since the bleeding time test was available 24/7, it was typically performed not later than 8\u201312 h from injury. Due to small patient sample, multivariate analysis was not done. Further detailed data on the control group was not available. Lastly, clinical outcome at 6 months was available for 82.7% of patients.",

Therefore, at this point, any specific recommendations for its use cannot be provided. However, the bleeding time test may provide an additional assessment in the interpretation of the overall status of the TBI patients with AUD. This test should be used as an indicator of primary hemostasis dysfunction in comparison with other cohorts only in combination with the patient\u2019s bleeding history and careful assessment of other hematologic parameters.",
