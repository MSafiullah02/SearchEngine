Based on a review of 34 months of data from 5 domestic and international airlines, Peterson and colleagues [1] determined that the 3 most common situations prompting calls to a medical communications center were syncope (37%), respiratory problems (12%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (10%). Any of those signs and symptoms could be associated with an infectious disease. The actual prevalence of infectious diseases among the 11,920 in-flight medical emergencies in Peterson\u2019s study group was 2.8%. Focusing on children, Moore and associates [2] found that infectious diseases, neurologic emergencies, and respiratory tract problems were the leading reasons for medical consultation among the passengers transported by one airline between 1995 and 2002.",

Medical care providers should maintain close contact with the captain so that ground resources can be mobilized if necessary, ready to receive the patient upon landing. Federal and international guidelines require the reporting of encounters with patients with specific signs and symptoms. Compliance with those guidelines can be beneficial when the need arises to launch a contact investigation involving large numbers of people.
