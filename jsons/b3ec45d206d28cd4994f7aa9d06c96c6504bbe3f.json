            "text": "Disease is increasingly recognized as a threat to the conservation of wildlife, and in many cases the source of disease outbreaks in wild carnivores is the domestic dog. For disease to spill over from a domestic to a wild population, three conditions must be satisfied: susceptibility of the wild species, presence of the disease agent in the domestic population, and contact between the two populations of interest. We investigated the potential for disease spillover from the domestic dog population to the wild carnivore population in the Isoso of Bolivia, an area of tropical dry forest contiguous with a national park. Using questionnaires and discussions with residents, we gathered data on the demography of dogs in the Isoso, including adult and neonatal mortality, litter size, and hunting frequency. We analyzed a large data set containing self-recorded information on hunting in various communities of the Isoso to determine the extent of dog participation in hunting and the duration of hunting trips. Finally, we took blood samples from dogs in the Isoso for a serosurvey of common canine pathogens. More than 95% of dogs had positive titers to canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus. There was also a high seroprevalence in dogs for other pathogens, a high population turnover of dogs (which may allow diseases to be maintained endemically), and frequent opportunities for contact between domestic and wild carnivores. Based on our results and the susceptibility of wild species previously reported in the literature, domestic dogs represent a disease risk for wildlife in the Bolivian Isoso.",

Para que una enfermedad pase de una poblaci\u00f3n dom\u00e9stica a una silvestre, se deben satisfacer tres condiciones: susceptibilidad de la especie silvestre, presencia del agente pat\u00f3geno en la poblaci\u00f3n dom\u00e9stica y contacto entre las dos poblaciones de inter\u00e9s. Investigamos la potencial transmisi\u00f3n de enfermedades de la poblaci\u00f3n de perros dom\u00e9sticos a la poblaci\u00f3n de carn\u00edvoros silvestres en el Isoso de Bolivia, un\u00e1rea de bosque tropical seco contigua a un parque nacional. Mediante cuestionarios y discusiones con residentes, reunimos datos de la demograf\u00eda de perros en el Isoso, incluyendo mortalidad de adultos y neonatos, tama\u00f1o de camada y frecuencia de cacer\u00eda. Analizamos un extenso conjunto de datos conteniendo informaci\u00f3n sobre cacer\u00eda en varias comunidades del Isoso para determinar la extensi\u00f3n de la participaci\u00f3n de perros en la cacer\u00eda y la duraci\u00f3n de los viajes de cacer\u00eda. Finalmente, tomamos muestras de sangre de perros en el Isoso para un muestreo de suero para buscar los pat\u00f3genos caninos m\u00e1s comunes. M\u00e1s de 95% de los perros fueron positivos a moquillo y parvovirus caninos.

Domestic animals often act as reservoir species that can maintain infectious diseases in their populations and periodically transmit these diseases to na\u00efve wildlife populations (Cleaveland & Dye 1995; Rhodes et al. 1998; Lafferty & Gerber 2002) . More attention is now being paid to the diseases of domestic dogs that live in areas surrounding protected areas and other regions with significant wildlife populations (e.g., Alexander et al. 1993; Laurenson et al. 1998; Cleaveland et al. 2000) . Knowing which diseases are present and their prevalences are not the only important pieces of information; it is also necessary to understand the ecology of the dogs to determine their potential impact on the neighboring wildlife.",

In practice, however, buffer zones tend to be used for multiple purposes and are often the site of both sustainable and unsustainable resource exploitation (S\u00e1nchez-Azofeifa et al. 2003) . In Bolivia protected areas include national parks and integrated management areas (IMA). The IMAs generally surround parks and may include or be contiguous with indigenous territories (Tierra Comunitaria de Origen, or TCO).

Although it does not have legal status that defines it as part of the park buffer zone, for practical purposes it functions as such. About 8000 Isose\u00f1os inhabit 23 communities clustered along the Rio Parapet\u00ed in the TCO and use this 3000-4000 km 2 region west of the park boundary for subsistence and commercial hunting (Kaa-Iya Project 2001) . Dogs are abundant in the communities, and may come into contact with wildlife in or near the communities. In addition, because nearly all hunting activities include dogs (Noss & Cu\u00e9llar 2001; Kaa-Iya Project, unpublished data) and hunters from the communities utilize much of the TCO, the transmission of infectious diseases from the domestic dogs to wildlife is a potential risk. Previous research in Bolivia indicates that many domestic dogs have been exposed to pathogens of conservation concern ( Widdowson et al. 2002; Fiorello et al. 2004) .",

The Kaa-Iya Project employs members of the communities to serve as hunting monitors as part of their mission to manage the natural resources of the area. Data on hunting are collected to monitor harvests of game species, upon which the local people rely for protein. Hunters who volunteer to participate provide their community hunting monitor with information on location, date, time, and duration of each hunt and on weapons used, number of dogs present, the weather, and number and characteristics (age, sex, condition) of each animal harvested. Not all hunters in a given community participate, and those who do participate do not necessarily record complete data from every hunt. Individual communities differ in their level of hunter participation; in some, all hunters participate, whereas in others very few participate . However, despite these drawbacks, the data set does contain useful information. Based on hunts (n = 140) when researchers from the Kaa-Iya Project accompanied local hunters, we estimated that between 25 and 30% of hunts were successful (Kaa-Iya Project, unpublished data). Therefore, the data collected on successful hunts likely represent about 25% of the total hunting effort by participating hunters in the area.",

Iyobi and Yapiroa, two of the largest communities (Kaa-Iya Project, unpublished data), have a more diverse economy and their inhabitants are less likely than those in small communities to rely on seasonal migratory work and hunting. Residents of Rancho Viejo, an intermediate-sized community, rely heavily on hunting during the months when seasonal agricultural work is unavailable. Situated in the northern part of the Isoso on the east bank of the river, Rancho Viejo and Iyobi are more isolated than Yapiroa. Yapiroa is located farther south, on the west bank of the river, closer to the nearest town and railroad station. Dogs living in Yapiroa might be expected to have more contact with dogs from outside the Isoso because this area is closer to main roads and it is not necessary to cross the river to reach them. Accompanied by a community member, we walked from house to house, asking owners for permission to take blood samples from their dogs. To ensure that the antibodies detected were endogenous and not of maternal origin (Greene 1998a) , only dogs 5 months of age and older were sampled. We drew blood from the jugular vein. On the few occasions when dogs were too fractious to handle, they were sedated with standard intramuscular doses of acepromazine (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany).",

Sex and age data on dogs obtained during sampling both including and excluding Iyobi were compared with data obtained from the survey. The results were nearly identical and thus are not reported here. Based on the surveys and discussions with residents, we concluded that essentially all households had dogs. The rare household without a dog resulted from the temporary absence of adult men-who took their dogs with them when they left to do seasonal work-or the recent death of dogs that had not yet been replaced. Dogs in the Isoso are all owned, and are considered necessary for hunting all terrestrial species except brocket deer (Mazama gouazoupira). We did not collect data on the source of dogs, but informal discussions indicated that most dogs were received or purchased from friends or relatives in the Isoso, with an occasional dog being purchased in nearby cities. There were on average 3.8 adult dogs/household (Table 3 ) and 4.9 people/household (Kaa-Iya Project, unpublished data). There was roughly one dog for every 1.5 persons. Based on these estimates and the population census, a community the size of Iyobi has approximately 522 dogs (Table 1) . Data from the questionnaires indicated that 17 of 161 dogs (11%) were vaccinated against rabies. During sampling, however, rabies vaccination status was recorded for 60 dogs, and only 2 of these (3%) were vaccinated. Eightysix percent ( based on questionnaires) or 90% ( based on sampling data) of dogs were reported to hunt, which in a village of Iyobi's size equals 448-470 dogs ( Table 3) .",

Other viruses are also relatively common in this population. Although these pathogens may be of less conservation concern than CDV or CPV, they may still represent a risk for wild carnivores (Evermann et al. 2005) . First, because exposure to these less prevalent pathogens is not uniform, some dogs are becoming infected during their adulthood, and it is adult dogs that are most likely to encounter wildlife. Second, coinfection with some viruses, including canine coronavirus and canine adenovirus, can cause much more severe disease than single infection (Pratelli et al. 1999 (Pratelli et al. , 2001 , and it may increase the amount and duration of viral shedding of one or both pathogens (Pratelli et al. 2001) . Most dogs had antibodies to more than one disease agent. Although we have no data to demonstrate whether these are sequential or simultaneous infections, it is reasonable to assume that at least some of these dogs had simultaneous infections.",

The finding that antibodies to T. gondii were more common in dogs living near a cattle ranch may reflect their proximity to cats. Domestic cats are rare in the Isoso; however, several cats lived on or around this ranch. Felids are the definitive host for T. gondii, and so the dogs living near the ranch may be more likely to be exposed to infectious cysts shed in cats' feces. Although dogs may become infected from eating wild prey, they are rarely given meat by their owners and do not seem to hunt much on their own. It is also possible that they are being infected by cysts in the feces of wild felids, although this would not explain the higher seroprevalence in dogs near the ranch. Regardless of how they are being exposed, these dogs share an environment with their human caretakers, who are also susceptible to this zoonotic pathogen.",

This virus may persist in the environment and can be shed for prolonged periods of time in the urine of recovered dogs (Greene 1998b) . It is possible that the environment in Yapiroa is more contaminated with this virus than other areas. Because the data we collected for this study were cross-sectional, it is possible that an outbreak was beginning in Yapiroa and will continue to spread to other communities. If additional sampling is done in the future, we may be able to determine whether the pattern of higher exposure in Yapiroa is persisting or whether it represented an epidemic wave that spread through the Isoso. Based on the data from other pathogens, it does not appear that the river is serving as a geographic barrier to disease transmission among domestic dogs.",

In the Isoso, nearly all dogs that reach the age of 1 year will have been exposed to CDV and CPV (Fig. 4) . This is reassuring because those that survive the infection are likely to be immune for several years, and given the short lifespan of most Isose\u00f1o dogs, they are probably immune for life.

First, Isose\u00f1o communities have an abundance of dogs. These dogs are infrequently vaccinated and receive no other preventive health care, an unsurprising finding in a place where people are often unable to obtain adequate health care for themselves and their families. Second, the high mortality of dogs, and especially of puppies, suggests that mortality from disease is playing a large role in regulating the canine population. Owners' descriptions of the clinical signs exhibited by puppies support the conclusion that many of the pups are suffering from infectious diseases. Third, the apparent high turnover of the population-over 1000 puppies born just in Iyobi each year-provides for many new susceptible hosts to contract and shed pathogens, thus preventing disease agents from dying out.",
