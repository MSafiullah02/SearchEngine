            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) refers unspecifically to infections of lower airways, either with intrapulmonary shunt (bronchitis and pneumonia) or with dynamic hyperinflation (bronchiolitis and wheeze). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is clearly the major pathogen associated with LRTI during infancy and early childhood. However, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses are also common known causative agents of LRTI in infants and children. Even so, a specific etiologic agent is often not identified in clinical practice because of lack of sensitive tests for all known agents and the presence of yet unrecognized pathogens. The recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronavirus NL63 have contributed to resolve the etiological diagnosis in many cases (van den Hoogen et al., 2001, van der Hoek et al., 2004). However, the proportion of LRTI without an etiological agent associated remains not contemptible. In 2005, human bocavirus (HBoV) was added to the ever expanding list of viruses associated to LRTI in children (Allander et al., 2005). Shortly after, a worldwide distribution of the virus was evidenced (Arnold et al., 2006, Bastien et al., 2006, Chung et al., 2006, Foulongne et al., 2006, Kaplan et al., 2006, Kesebir et al., 2006, Kleines et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2006, Ma et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006, Smuts and Hardie, 2006, Weissbrich et al., 2006).",

Primers were designed in highly conserved regions of the (NP-1) and VP1/VP2 genes based on a multiple alignment constructed with all genome sequences of bocaviruses available at the GenBank database. A whole of 5 \u03bcl of total nucleic acid extracted were added to 45 \u03bcl of reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Amplitaq, Perkin-Elmer Cetus) and 10 pmol of primers HBOV1f (5\u2032-CACAGGAGCMGGAGYCGCAG) and HBOV1r (5\u2032-CCAAGATATYTRTATCCAGG) for HBoV amplification and 10 pmol of primers RTS (5\u2032-GCTTGGGCGTGTCTCAAAATCT) and RTA (5\u2032-GTCGCCACGGTTGATGAGAGCT) for the internal control amplification. Amplifications were carried out in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200 (MJ Research). Temperature and time profiles were 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. After the first amplification round, 1 \u03bcl of the reaction product was added to 49 \u03bcl of the nested reaction mixture containing the same reagents used for the first reaction mixture with exception of primers, HBOV2f (5\u2032-GTGGTGTGGGTTCTACTGGC) and HBOV2r (5\u2032-CTACGGTACACATCATCCCAG) for specific HBoV amplification, and NS3 (5\u2032-CGTAATGGCTGGCCTGT) and NA2 (5\u2032-GTAATGCTCTGCCAGTGT) for the internal control amplification. Cycling conditions were the same that those used for the first round, but only 30 cycles were necessary. A total of 10 \u03bcl of each second round amplification product was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose in 0.5\u00d7 TBE gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 \u03bcg/ml), and visualized under UV light. The specific band for HBoV corresponded to 243 bp and the internal control to 350 pb (Fig. 1\n). Usual precautions were implemented to avoid false positive results by carryover contamination. Positive results were confirmed by testing a new aliquot of sample.",

Out of the 917 NPA specimens studied, a total of 123 tested positive for HBoV, accounting for 13.4%. This high incidence of HBoV infection observed in our study population, which consisted mainly in hospitalized patients, are in accordance with rates previously published ranging from 10.3% to 19% (Allander et al., 2007, Choi et al., 2006, Kaplan et al., 2006, Kleines et al., 2007, Smuts and Hardie, 2006, Weissbrich et al., 2006). Nevertheless, rates appreciably lower ranging between 3.1% and 8% have also been published by other authors (Allander et al., 2005, Arnold et al., 2006, Chung et al., 2006, Foulongne et al., 2006, Kesebir et al., 2006, Lu et al., 2006, Ma et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006). Rather than geographic differences in HBoV circulation, this discrepancy may be explained by differences observed in the patients studied. Several studies included exclusively hospitalized children while others enrolled either hospitalized and outpatient children. In the same way, several studies are focused on LRTI patients and others are based on patients with less severe lung disease, or infants and young children versus adults patients. In addition, differences observed in the incidence of HBoV infection could also be due to the variety of respiratory samples taken from patients, or alternatively to differences inherent in sensitivity of PCR assays employed.",

Nevertheless, diarrhea is a relatively common symptom presented in patients with HBoV infection (Arnold et al., 2006, Kesebir et al., 2006). The presence of HBoV in stool and urine samples may merely reflect the excretion of the virus by the digestive and urinary tracts, but also could be considered suggestive of other manifestations of HBoV-associated disease, not limited to the respiratory tract. As a support of this hypothesis, detection of HBoV in serum specimens taken from children with an episode of acute wheezing has recently been published (Allander et al., 2007).

High co-infections rates is not in opposition to a pathogenic role of HBoV in respiratory diseases.

Nevertheless, it might be a reflect that infants and children, as well as occurs with other respiratory viruses, could be re-infected with HBoV, twice at least in the same season. Unfortunately, urine and stool specimens could not been collected from these three patients.",
