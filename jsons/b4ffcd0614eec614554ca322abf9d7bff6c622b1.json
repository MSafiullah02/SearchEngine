Several viral vaccine vectors have emerged to date, all of them having relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application. Recent successes re fl ect diverse improvements such as development of new adenovirus serotypes and prime-boost regimes.

However, to protect against more complex pathogens such as Human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Plasmodium falciparum , Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) or cancers it will be necessary to engage the other arm of the adaptive immune system: T lymphocytes. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence supports the role of T cell immunity and in particular CD8 + T cells in the control and/or clearance of these diseases (Kim and Ahmed 2010 ) . Therefore, a rapidly expanding fi eld in vaccinology is the development of so-called genetic vaccines. These are designed to induce antigen-speci fi c CD4 + and CD8 + T cells of suf fi cient magnitude and necessary phenotype or effector function that directly contribute to pathogen clearance, rather than only CD4 + T cell help for B cells leading to protective antibody responses. One way to induce a T cell response against a given antigen is to express that antigen intracellularly, along with suitable pathogen-derived innate activators, through gene delivery; genetic or gene-based vaccines attempt to use physiological antigen processing and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I presentation to activate a CD8 + T cell response. Genetic vaccines as being capable of stimulating both antibodies and CD8 + T cells hold real promise for achieving ef fi cacy.

After intramuscular or intradermal injection they express the encoded antigen inside the host cells resulting in both cellular and humoral immunity. These vaccines are simple to produce and can be manipulated to co-express cytokines or other molecules intended to enhance the immune response, and are simple to produce. Unfortunately, the early successes in pre-clinical studies did not translate into clinical trials, and whereas DNA vaccines are safe to use and do induce T cell responses in humans, these are of a very low magnitude. Efforts to increase immunogenicity by use of new devices such as the 'gene-gun' resulted in more ef fi cient delivery such that the dose could be considerably reduced, but the response was not increased. Despite several efforts to fi nd an adjuvant to increase the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in humans, success has so far been modest . The same holds true for peptide-based vaccines (Nardin 2010 ; Perez et al. 2010 ) . Other research has concentrated on developing adjuvants to increase the T cell immunogenicity of protein vaccines, (Foged et al. 2011 ) , but again although responses can be induced in preclinical studies, they are not of high magnitude and in many cases have not yet been tested in clinical studies. Numerous viral vectors are being studied for use in gene-based vaccine strategies. Virus-derived vectors offer several advantages over traditional vaccine technologies, the fi rst being a very ef fi cient delivery of the exogenous gene into target cells. Other advantages include high level production of protein antigens within cells of the immunized host, potential adjuvant effects of the viral vector system itself and the possibility of ef fi cient delivery of antigen directly to components of the immune system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 94, "text": "(Liu 2010 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 95, "end": 125, "text": "Reyes-Sandoval and Ertl 2001 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1066, "text": "(Nardin 2010 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1086, "text": "Perez et al. 2010 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1222, "text": "(Foged et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetic Vaccines: The New Frontier"}, {"text": "The most commonly used vectors are derived from adenoviruses, poxviruses, alphaviruses and lentiviruses.

The resulting virus retained its ability to grow in culture and, importantly the immunogenicity of the chimaera was comparable to that of Ad5.

In chimpanzee adenoviruses the E1 locus can be deleted to render virus replication de fi cient and to allow trans-complementation in Ad5 E1 complementing cell line. Chimpanzee derived adenoviruses exhibit high sequence similarity and same genomic organization to human adenoviruses and can be classi fi ed in subgroups based on sequence homology of the hexon protein. Phylogenetic analysis of the hexons of simian and human adenoviruses shows substantial overlap indicating that there is no clear sequence feature that distinguished a simian from a human adenovirus.

To fully harness the great potential of DCs as the \"gatekeeper\" for initiating and maintaining immunity, Yang and colleagues (Yang et al. 2008 ) reported the generation of a LV system bearing a mutated glycoprotein derived from the SIN capable of targeting DCs through binding to the speci fi c intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 183, "text": "(Collins and Cerundolo 2004 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 184, "end": 219, "text": "Collins and Esslinger et al. 2003 ;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 220, "end": 236, "text": "He et al. 2005 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 237, "end": 253, "text": "Hu et al. 2011 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 708, "end": 731, "text": "(Iglesias et al. 2007 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 870, "end": 890, "text": "(Buffa et al. 2006 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1117, "text": "(Beignon et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1266, "text": "(Yang et al. 2008 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lentivirus Vectors"}, {"text": "Despite the desirable advantage of LVs to effectively deliver transgenes into DCs, vector integration in the host cell genome has provoked safety concerns over the consequences of insertional mutagenesis (Bokhoven et al. 2009 ; Montini et al. 2006 ) .

Several studies have shown that priming/boosting with different vaccine vectors elicits higher immune response to the transgene-encoded antigen than repeated vaccination with an individual vector.

A consistent observation throughout all of these studies is the differential ability of certain vectors to prime or boost responses. DNA vaccines and FPV are good priming vectors, whereas poxviruses (MVA and NYVAC) are consistently able to boost T cell responses that are primed by other means. The utility of MVA-based vaccines to prime immune responses against foreign antigens appears to be limited due to unfavorable competition for immunodominance between the relatively large number of vector-speci fi c gene products (Antoine et al. 1998 ) and the much smaller number of intended vaccine antigens (Smith et al. 2005 b ) . A large body of data now indicates that, in general, recombinant Ad can prime T cell and B cell responses remarkably well. Therefore, an optimal regimen would use adenovirus fi rst to prime and MVA later to boost the previously vaccine induced immune response.

For a substantial amount of time, the use of cis acting sequences for enhancing the ef fi cacy of vaccination was DNA vaccine territory and there are not many strategies to increase the response to adenovirus vaccine vectors that have been published so far (Holst et al. 2010 ) . It is tempting to speculate that viral vectored vaccines contain suf fi cient pathogen-associated molecular patterns to substitute for many cytokines co-administered with the vaccine. Compared to DNA vaccines, viral vectors more ef fi ciently enters and transduce cells, including professional antigen presenting cells, generally induce very high levels of protein Caltech and UCLA I expression in the transduced cells, and induce substantial innate immune activation. In this regard, they are close to a natural infection or vaccination with live attenuated vaccines, but with an improved safety pro fi le. A down-side is that vector antigens compete with the encoded vaccine antigen and focuses the response on immunodominant epitopes (Schirmbeck et al. 2008 ) . In a search for adenovirus vaccine modi fi cations which might lead to broader T cell responses, Holst and coworkers decided to improve MHC class II antigen presentation by covalently linking the encoded antigen to the MHC class II associated invariant chain (Holst et al. 2008 ) .

Expression of rEA elicited signi fi cantly increased TLR mediated innate immune responses as measured by the in fl ux of plasma cytokines and chemokines, and activation of innate immune responding cells in mice. Therefore, simultaneous expression of rEA, or potentially other similar TLR ligands from an Ad vector, can serve to enhance cell mediated immunity responses to pathogen derived antigens expressed from the same vectors.

Additionally, global indication of a vaccine implies use in the developing world where intact cold chain for shipping, distribution and storage and sophisticated equipment for vaccine administration are not always available.
