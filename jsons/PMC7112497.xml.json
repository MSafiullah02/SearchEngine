Since then the disease has become pandemic, with (at the time of writing) 8098 patients and 744 deaths in over 30 countries.4, 5 The complete genomes of four SARS-CoV isolates have been sequenced independently.6 Comparison with sequences of other human and animal coronaviruses has shown that SARS-CoV is distinct from them and warrants classification as a new group within the Coronaviridae.7, 8, 9\n",

Why these viruses did not spread in the Hong Kong population when HKU-33a/b did so is unclear. Epidemiological data suggest that a few index cases caused a disproportionate number of secondary cases, the so-called \u201csuper-spreading incidents\u201d.24 The initiation by HKU-33a/b in patient 1 of the first super-spreading incident in Hong Kong may have been simply a matter of chance. Once this had occurred, second super-spreading events (as happened in Prince of Wales Hospital and in the Amoy Gardens apartment block) were stochastically more likely to follow from this cluster. An alternative hypothesis is that the viruses of the HKU-33a/b lineage (cluster B) are biologically more predisposed to initiating super-spreading events. This hypothesis needs more detailed investigation. Whether the presence of more than one genetic variant in patient 1 is relevant to the rapid spreading of this virus strain also requires further investigation.",

However, sequence comparison of the two Amoy Gardens isolates did not reveal any significant variations within the S1 gene (figure 2) nor across the rest of the genome (figure 3). This virus is therefore unlikely to have arisen from a different source from that of the major Hong Kong outbreak. The explosive transmission of the virus during the Amoy Gardens outbreak may be explained by an unusual route of transmission.20 Aerosolisation of contaminated sewage20 and a role for animal vectors such as rodents27 have been proposed.",
