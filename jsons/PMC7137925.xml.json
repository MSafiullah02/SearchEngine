Each instrument is grounded in a different constitutional function: Article 19 (Conventions), Article 21 (Regulations), and Article 23 (Recommendations). These agreements provide models for global health diplomacy, advancing WHO's historic normative mission (figure\n).2 As international treaties, the FCTC and IHR are legally binding.

FCTC dispute settlement, moreover, is voluntary and only possible between Parties. The COP cannot make a formal complaint if a state violates the Convention. COP7 (Delhi, India; November, 2016) called for knowledge hubs, toolkits, and strategic frameworks on sustainable measures to strengthen implementation.7, 8, 9 The FCTC could be bolstered by built-in compliance mechanisms.

This contributes to governments' continued divergent approaches to electronic cigarettes, ranging from outright bans and regulation (as prescribed smoking cessation products) to no regulation.",

            "text": "The tobacco industry has aggressively litigated against tobacco control laws, bringing cases before domestic courts, the WTO, and under international investment treaties. International litigation has targeted states with innovative laws such as plain packaging, graphic images, and single presentation limits (only one tobacco product per brand name). Low-income states are wary to assume the economic and political costs incurred in defending lawsuits. Panel 2\ndescribes legal challenges to tobacco control laws in Australia, Norway, and Uruguay, while table 1\nsummarises national and international litigation.Panel 2International tobacco control litigation\nNorway: display ban\nIn 2009, Norway prohibited the display of tobacco products in any stores other than tobacconists (termed the display ban). The display ban prohibited display of any tobacco products or vending machine tokens; stores could present only a list of products and prices in neutral typography and layout. Advertising (eg, with brands, logos, and images) was prohibited. Similar bans were enacted in Iceland, Ireland, Finland, Panama, New Zealand, and the UK. Philip Morris challenged Norway's display ban, claiming it unlawfully restricted free trade under the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement.The Court of Justice for the European Free Trade Association States issued an advisory opinion finding that the display ban was a quantitative import restriction, but left it to the national court to decide whether the public health objective could be achieved by less restrictive measures. In September, 2012, the District Court of Oslo upheld the display ban, concluding that it was a suitable and necessary measure to ensure public health protection. It said the absence of visible tobacco products in shops is essential to denormalise tobacco. The Court ordered Philip Morris to pay 1\u00b736 million Norwegian kroner to cover litigation costs.\nUruguay: single presentation\nIn 2008\u201309, Uruguay implemented a single presentation requirement precluding tobacco manufacturers from marketing more than one variant of cigarette per brand family. Based on this requirement, Philip Morris could not market Marlboro Red, Marlboro Gold, Marlboro Blue, and Marlboro Green, but could market only one label. Uruguay also required graphic warning labels covering 80% of the front and back of cigarette packages, leaving only 20% for trademarks and logos. In 2010, Philip Morris requested arbitration at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), asserting that Uruguay had violated the bilateral investment treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay.In July, 2016, the international trade arbitration panel upheld Uruguay's tobacco control measures as a valid exercise of the state's police powers, stressing that Uruguay had fulfilled the obligations of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).12 The panel noted that the FCTC is an evidence-based treaty guaranteeing the right to health. The arbitration panel also ruled that the regulations were not a direct or indirect expropriation of Philip Morris's intellectual property. The panel ordered Philip Morris to compensate Uruguay US$7 million for litigation expenses.\nAustralia: plain packaging\nAustralia was the first country to adopt plain packaging in 2011, whereby tobacco must be sold in a uniform, drab, olive-brown package with graphic images. The legislation was designed to avoid misleading consumers about the devastating effects of smoking.13 Since then, Canada, Chile, France, South Africa, and the UK have introduced similar laws.Seeking to deter adoption of plain packaging in other countries, tobacco manufacturers and countries friendly to the industry brought domestic and international litigation against Australia, including an investor-state dispute arbitration conducted under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and dispute settlement proceedings in the World Trade Organization (WTO). In December, 2015, UNCITRAL ruled in favour of Australia on a procedural claim, saying the industry had \u201cabused\u201d the arbitration process.14 Reports indicate that the interim report of the WTO panel has found Australia's plain packaging measures to be a legitimate public health measure. The Dominican Republic, Cuba, Indonesia, and Honduras are challenging Australia's plain packaging as a violation of trade and intellectual property. As the various cases proceed, Australia's litigation costs keep rising, and are estimated to exceed AUS$50 million.15\n",

The COP, for example, could create a standing technical committee to propose regulations for novel technologies, complementing the WHO Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation.16 Sustainable funding is also essential. The COP transformed the FCTC's voluntary assessed contributions into mandatory contributions at the most recent meeting in November, 2016, and continues to encourage states and philanthropic organisations to increase extra-budgetary funding and pursue revenue-generating strategies.17, 18\n",
