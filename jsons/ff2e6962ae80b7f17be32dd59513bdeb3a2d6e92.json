Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 have thus far been described as fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. 3 Interestingly, a recent update provided by the American Academy of Ophthalmology discussed conjunctivitis as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 in affected patients. 4 Initial reports of COVID-19 did not report ocular transmission as a possibility. Xia and colleagues at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University evaluated the conjunctival secretions of 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19. 5 In one of these patients, both tear and conjunctival secretions tested positive for the virus by rRT-PCR. 5 Additionally, data from 1099 patients were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, in which \"conjunctival congestion\" was found in 0.8% of the patients. 6 Despite these uncommonly reported statistics, there are numerous anecdotal reports of a red eye being the initial symptom before the onset of pneumonia, including that of Guangfa Wang, a national expert on the panel for pneumonia during the early investigations in Wuhan, China. 7 Mr. Wang wore an N95 mask during his initial investigations of patients in Wuhan but did not have any protective eye equipment. Several days before his respiratory symptoms, he reported having a red eye, suggesting possible ocular transmission. 8 Given this, eye care professionals, most notably ophthalmologists, may be the first point of contact in the health care field for patients with possible COVID-19, before the onset of characteristic respiratory symptoms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 157, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 302, "end": 303, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 695, "end": 696, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 861, "end": 862, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1093, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1201, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1366, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1647, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1894, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In this case report, it can be seen that the clinical presentation can vary and fluctuate.

Affected areas at that time included mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. Other exposure criteria included close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 or laboratory exposure to biological material known to contain COVID-19. 10,11 Our patient did not meet the initial testing guidelines and was only tested once the guidelines were updated to include all travel outside of Canada, emphasizing the importance of adapting quickly to rapidly evolving epidemiology in the context of an evolving pandemic.

Regardless of travel history or known or suspected infectious pathogen, every patient interaction should include an assessment of the risk of exposure to bodily fluids (including respiratory or eye secretions) to the health care worker and the appropriate PPE should be selected. 9, 15 The WHO also notes that a number of aerosol-generating medical procedures, including tracheal intubation and manual ventilation, have been associated with an increased risk of coronavirus transmission. 12\u00c014 As a result, health care workers engaging in such aerosol-generating medical procedures should additionally use a certified N95 mask. 12\u00c014 As always, for patients suspected of having an infectious red eye, it is imperative to follow disinfection practices that have already been outlined to prevent the spread of viral infection before and after each patient visit. Given that COVID-19 is due to an enveloped virus, it is susceptible to the alcohol and bleach disinfectants that are typically used in current ophthalmic practice. 16 A formalized protocol for all hospital-based and private eye clinics should be developed to minimize the risk of exposure for patients and health care providers. A report from the Hong Kong experience suggests that protocols should include prescreening at the administrative level to call and reschedule nonurgent patients with symptoms or travel history in the last 14 days, avoiding micro-aerosol generating procedures such as noncontact tonometry, environment, and infection control protocols to reduce droplet transmission and availability of proper PPE. 17 Patients can also be screened or managed through tele-ophthalmology if patients are able to send photographs of their eye to their eye care professional. Importantly, it should be noted that asymptomatic individuals can still pass on viral infection up to 48 hours before the onset of symptoms. 18, 19 CONCLUSIONS We present a case of COVID-19 that presented initially to ophthalmology with keratoconjunctivitis and mild respiratory symptoms, without fever. The patient's primary symptom and reason for repeatedly seeking care was a red eye with watery discharge. The case emphasizes the importance for eye care professionals to remain vigilant and consider SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent in patients presenting with viral conjunctivitis, particularly in high-risk patients with travel to areas of active transmission of the virus. These cases could represent an early presentation of COVID-19.
