Our competitiveness and national success depend on our students' science aptitude (edsource). National Science Teachers Association teachers point to lack of student motivation as a major concern in US science education (news). The need for a new approach to improve science and math education is compelling and well supported. In the American Academy for the Advancement of Science Project 2061, \u201cjust doing more science was not the answer\u201d (project 2061). Current methods put more value on learning correct answers versus exploration, collaboration, and inquiry. They recommend \u201cpractices where the learning of science is as much about the process as the result or outcome, and where students can ask questions and are actively engaged in the learning process, refocusing student learning from knowledge and comprehension to application and analysis.\u201d (project 2061). Inquiry is \u201ccentral to science learning\u201d as students develop their understanding of science concepts combining knowledge, reasoning, and thinking while enhancing comprehension through hands-on learning. The National Research Council agrees. They state \u201ceffective instruction capitalizes on students' early interest and experiences, identifies and builds on what they know, and provides them with experiences that serve to engage them in the practices of science and sustain their interest\u201d (NRC, 2011).",

They embrace the scientific process and thinking skills put forth in Vision and Change, adding microbiology-based laboratory skills. Further to adopting the five core concepts of Vision and Change, the Guidelines added a sixth core concept, Impact of Microorganisms, specific to this field. Each of the six core concepts is exemplified by four or five microbiology-specific fundamental statements, which reflect basic concepts that are important for all microbiology students to understand in depth. These 27 fundamental statements, together with the four scientific thinking skills and seven laboratory skills, form a comprehensive framework for an undergraduate microbiology course. (Merkel and the ASM Task Force on Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology, 2012). In addition, the ASM Curriculum Guidelines were designed to focus microbiology teaching on student-centered goals and priorities and to enable educators to adopt the discipline-based approach to course design for microbiology courses.\u201d(Horak et al., 2015).\n",

One goal of epidemiology is to recognize infectious disease outbreaks and to attribute the outbreak to a source to prevent additional cases (see Chapter 16 for further detailed information). In many aspects, microbial forensics employs the same tools as those used in epidemiology. A training program in microbial forensics will parallel many parts of current programs in epidemiology. Models can be obtained from epidemiology curricula, and experience from natural outbreaks will help guide how microbial forensic scientists will perform investigations of biocrimes. Tracing the course of an outbreak will assist in identifying the index case, cause, and/or time of the outbreak. With many disease outbreaks, as well as cases of unusual infections (e.g., monkeypox), the recurring question will be: Is this a natural event or an intentional attack? Epidemiological factors will help distinguish between natural or intentional events and enable more effective responses in either event. A biocrime may be recognized through surveillance linking multiple unusual disease occurrences in contiguous or noncontiguous geographic areas. A microbial forensic investigation may be based on initial public health findings and then proceed further to address attribution to identify the perpetrator(s) of a biocrime or bioterrorist act.",

The field provides a good example where application of newer technologies may help overcome many of the same problems encountered with traditional epidemiology with respect to study design and interpretation (4). Molecular tools can be employed to characterize and potentially individualize samples and isolates to address forensically relevant questions. This subdivision of epidemiology has special importance in microbial forensics because it is desirable to determine the source of a particular microbe used in a crime. Highly discriminating assays can precisely identify strains and isolates, resulting in a more focused and effective investigation. These types of data could associate a sample with a single geographic area, even possibly a particular laboratory or flask, or with the specific conditions and nutrients used to culture the microorganism. Some of these aspects are discussed in the chapters on anthrax.",

Depending on the nature of the crime, there may be multiple crime scenes requiring different sets of skills, knowledge, equipment, and abilities (see Chapters 21 and 22Chapter 21Chapter 22 for more details). Once the crime scene(s) has (have) been identified and delimited, a plan is needed to properly collect and maintain integrity of the evidence that may be subsequently analyzed. Practices are needed to maintain the integrity and that minimize contamination of the evidence. The handling and storage of evidence is integral to minimizing degradation of the target analytes. Microbial contamination may be somewhat different from other types of contamination because the contaminating organisms can replicate thus confounding results. The nuances of a microbial forensic investigation add a layer on top of traditional crime scene investigations, particularly because of the hazardous nature of the evidence. The need for proper documentation may seem obvious but it is a very important part of maintaining the integrity of the evidence. Crime scenes are chaotic and missteps can occur. To minimize missteps in handling documentation procedures should be established so the crime scene can be reconstructed at a later date for investigators or in a court of law. It is likely that biocrimes and acts of bioterrorism will add another dimension of complexity because (i) there is less experience in crime scene collection due to (fortunately) fewer cases, (ii) addressing the safety of victims will not be trivial, (iii) investigators will be wearing cumbersome but absolutely necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), (iv) the best approaches for collection and preservation of evidence may have to be determined at the scene given the limited extant information available, and (v) the response to biocrime events by using forensic science in an attribution involves a complex interplay among science, policy, law, law enforcement, public health, medical, and media communities (bioattribution) and may require several different areas of expertise and authority. This aggregation of diverse disciplines and professions, \u201cbrought together to develop an understanding and action plan in response to a suspicious event\u201d is challenging in a domestic context, and even more formidable if an event has global implications (Bidwell et al., 2016).

Thus, crime scene investigation, safety, PPE, collection, chain of custody, and sharing important past casework experiences and examples of how to manage the interplay of the different disciplines and professionals should be included as essential parts of any curriculum.\n",

While most approaches focus on collection tools, it is very important to consider sampling strategies to obtain the most relevant data, which involves strategic planning, logistics, and statistics. Conditions that are proper for collection and/or preservation of one microbe may be deleterious for another and, for that matter, to traditional forensic materials such as human DNA, fingerprints, and trace materials. For example, foodborne pathogens are particularly vexing; conditions that are intended to preserve the material may promote growth of natural bacteria in a food product, and this overgrowth may destroy or obscure the initial bioweapon. Tools for collection need to be validated for efficient collection and for determining that they do not react with the target of interest. Tools developed for powder collection may be inefficient or ineffective for collecting plant material. Sample collection is not trivial and requires substantial consideration. Issues related to the practices of sample collection, handling, transportation, and storage of microbes in the investigation of biocrimes and guidelines for the collection of evidence by physicians and medical personnel from potential victims of bioterrorism have been published and are valuable for education and training programs (Schutzer et al., 2005).",

However, the sequence differences may be limited to only informative single-nucleotide sequence (SNP) differences as represented by the genus Bacillus (Derzelle et al., 2015). Genetically similar microbes are analyzed via comparative genomics tools where multiple SNP patterns (canonical SNPs (canSNPs)) emerge and can distinguish geographically unique strains from one another when compared with reference strains of known biothreat agents (Dahiya, 2017). Many different phylogenetic tools and software are available now to perform such genetic comparisons.

There will be times when the evidence will be used in a court of law to prosecute an individual who has been arrested for a biocrime. There are standards for admissibility of scientific evidence in a legal setting. The scientist may be asked to provide expert testimony. These standards need to be known and appreciated so that admissibility of evidence can be achieved. The government will use microbial forensic scientists and other experts, their results, the scientific literature, and supporting validation studies to support its position. The defense will defend its client vigorously to attempt to achieve an acquittal. Because of the adversary system, challenges are expected to the credibility of the science and its practitioners in the United States and other English-based law countries (Harmon et al., 2005, Kirsch and Daubert 1995). Studying the science behind headlines can be a very instructive and creative way to interest students. Some controversial issues in forensic DNA, which can be used instructively, involve (1) the use of low quantities of template DNA (Budowle et al., 2009, Gilder et al., 2009), (2) population genetics issues and associated degrees of confidence (NRC), (3) potential contamination and background signals, (4) sufficient and appropriate validation studies, and (5) access to proprietary information or intellectual property.",

The primary goal is to intercede and thwart the attack before it can happen. Alternatively, if an attack has occurred, a head of state may require some evidence to determine whether to retaliate and to whom retaliation should be directed. Results from microbial evidence are far reaching and have consequences. Training individuals in understanding the strengths and limitations of scientific evidence is essential so that proper decisions and responses can be made.

Other forms of education should include didactic lectures, workshops, conferences, practical demonstrations, and discussions at specialty meetings. Those interested in the development of formal microbial forensic degree programs will find resources from academic, government, industry, and professional societies. The target audience may include laboratory directors, bench scientists, other practitioners, faculty, college students, law enforcement representatives, medical care and first responder personnel, lawyers, and judges.
