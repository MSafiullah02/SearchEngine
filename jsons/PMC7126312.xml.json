            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat in hospitalised patients, and both mortality and morbidity from infection are greater when caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria [1], [2], [3], [4]. Among these resistant bacteria, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) are of great concern because antimicrobial therapy for infections due to these resistant pathogens remains a clinical dilemma in hospitalised patients [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Increases in the prevalence of these resistant pathogens in hospitals are frequently related to the high selective pressure of antimicrobials commonly used in hospitalised patients, particularly extended-spectrum cephalosporins, \u03b2-lactam\u2013\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Importantly, susceptibility profiles of nosocomial pathogens are affected not only by a single agent but also by use of multiple agents [21]. The higher resistance of organisms to some antimicrobial agents is frequently associated with heavy use of fewer antimicrobials [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Understanding the hospital antibiogram and hospital profile of antimicrobial use is mandatory in solving the problem of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals.",

However, cefotaxime resistance in Enterobacter spp. and ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa declined gradually.

However, increasing resistance may further drive increased consumption of several so-called \u2018last-line\u2019 antimicrobial agents. In this study, the increase in the incidence of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii and cefotaxime-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae resulted in an increase in the use of carbapenems. The increased use of these agents was significantly associated with an increase in the incidence of nosocomial infections due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and other NFGNB, particularly among patients hospitalised in intensive care units (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that the spread of pauci-clones of carbapenem-resistant or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii and poly-clones of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in intensive care units and other wards at the hospital contributes significantly to the increased rates of carbapenem resistance among these isolates [6], [10], [11], [12].",
