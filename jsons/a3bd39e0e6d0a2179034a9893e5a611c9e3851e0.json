            "text": "The risk of pandemic Are we really at risk for pandemic? Very much so. Avian influenza is well known for jumping the species barrier -both between fowl and human, and between fowl and pig and human, among others. So far, avian influenza has not been transmissible from human to human. What could turn this into a pandemic is a unique feature of Influenza Aits capacity for antigenic shift. Antigenic shift arises from a reassortment of the surface glycoproteins of the virus. Influenza viruses are classified according to their two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The hemagglutinin (H) is the surface glycoprotein that mediates the entry of the virus into host cells. The neuraminidase (N) is an enzyme that facilitates cell-to-cell spread. An antigenic shift occurs when there are two concurrent influenza A infections in a host that lead to reassortment of the H and N glycoproteins. A new hemagglutinin, such as H5 or H7 from the current avian influenza outbreaks, reassorted into a human influenza virus is the most likely source of a pandemic. 4, 5 WHO has recently noted that the control of H5N1 avian influenza in Asia has proven difficult, and will likely not be eradicated in the short term. 3 At the beginning of March, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency noted that in addition to a benign outbreak, there was a highly pathogenic H7N3 virus outbreak in a farm in British Columbia. 6 There are a number of challenges in developing a vaccine for an H5 or H7 virus. First is the pathogenicity of these viruses -neither H5 nor H7 can be grown in the usual egg medium as they are both lethal to egg embryos. Plasmid-based reverse genetics technologies are being developed and represent a promising alternative. However, these involve the use of cell lines and present their own set of challenges: intellectual property issues, issues of availability and suitability, and an unknown safety profile. 5",

            "text": "A pandemic influenza could begin anywhere in the world, and would likely spread quickly. Based on a model developed by Melzer and colleagues, 6 the Canadian plan estimates that between 4.5 to 10.6 million people in Canada could contract this disease, with 2-5 million people seeking outpatient care and 34-138,000 requiring hospitalization. 1 In Canada, 43 people died from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) last year; pandemic influenza could kill 43,000. Pandemic influenza has the potential to be 1000 times worse than SARS. It is difficult to imagine how our local health, public health and emergency services could respond to such a situation, in light of our recent experience with SARS. SARS revealed a lack of surge capacity locally, provincially and nationally. 7 It also revealed the need for health, public health and emergency services to work more closely together. 8 The need for public health leadership The Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan points out that \"local public health authorities are responsible for planning the local response to an influenza pandemic. This involves liaising with local partners (e.g., emergency responders, hospitals, mortuary services) in advance of a pandemic to facilitate a coordinated response.\"",

We are planning a prevention strategy for decreasing the spread of respiratory infections, which we plan to launch in schools, long-term care institutions and physicians' offices later this year. Others have launched a website promoting business continuity planning. 10 Challenges abound. For example, although the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan highlights numerous local responsibilities regarding a pandemic, it is silent on where the funding for the local planning, mitigation and response will come from. It is also silent on who is responsible for setting up and staffing alternative (or non-traditional) assessment and treatment sites to care for patients when the hospitals are overwhelmed.",
