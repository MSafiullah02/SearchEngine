Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a pulmonary disease, named Covid-19, which is proving to be a major global health burden [1]. Substantial proportion of cases progress to severe disease, where approximately 5% of patients require intensive care support and over 20% of critical cases succumb to the disease [2]. While overall mortality rate is likely to be lower than the current estimates, as the prevalence of mildly symptomatic cases has yet to be clearly defined, Covid-19 nonetheless represents a global health emergency. There are no licensed vaccines or proven antiviral therapy to protect or treat against Covid-19. Hence once infected, case management is entirely supportive care [2]. Antiviral therapy that effectively arrests disease progression and efficacious vaccines that protect against severe Covid-19 is thus urgently required to meet medical and public health needs.",

Convalescent Covid-19 patients can be expected to have reasonably high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Plasmapheresis could be used to collect sufficient volumes of plasma from individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, pooled and fractionated to produce hyperimmune globulin for infusion into acutely ill Covid-19 patients. Alternatively, fresh frozen plasma could also be delivered without additional fractionation. Such approaches have been explored for patients with viral pneumonia, including SARS and severe influenza [3], [4], [5]. Results have been mostly positive although many of such therapies have not been formally evaluated through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Theoretically, high titers of neutralizing antibody could reduce viral dissemination from infected to uninfected cells in the respiratory tract. When given soon after illness onset, this therapy could thus not only prevent disease progression, it could also lead to more rapid viral clearance and hence patient de-isolation. The latter would enable limited isolation wards to be made available to new Covid-19 patients sooner, enabling management of a larger number of Covid-19 patients despite finite containment capacity.",

However, lessons from research on the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have enabled rapid design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates for clinical development [6,7]. These vaccines have a common goal, i.e. to elicit polyclonal antibody responses against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralize viral infection. The vaccine candidates encompass a large diversity of vaccine platforms including mRNA, DNA, nanoparticle, subunit, and viral vectors [8]. Some of the new technological platforms, such as DNA and mRNA vaccines, can theoretically enable millions of vaccine doses to be rapidly manufactured within months and deployed to regions of need [9,10]. Indeed, unprecedented in the modern history of infectious diseases and vaccines, a vaccine candidate entered Phase I clinical trials within three months of the discovery of SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that a licensed vaccine should be available for widespread use by mid-2021.",

            "text": "ADE of infection can be elicited in vitro for many different viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus [15,16], influenza [17] and Ebola viruses [18,19]. Similarly, in vitro ADE of wild-type virus and pseudotype viruses into Fc receptor-expressing myeloid-derived cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of immune sera has also been described for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [14,[20], [21], [22]]. For CoVs, it has been shown that antibodies can bind the surface spike protein exposing the virus to proteolytic activation and Fc receptor-mediated entry [20]. However, in vitro observations need to be interpreted with caution, since few diseases have been clinically associated with ADE. The most prominent disease associated with ADE is arguably dengue, where infection with one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) predisposes a person to a more severe disease upon secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype [23,24]. A similar phenomenon was responsible for increased hospitalization rates following vaccination of dengue-na\u00efve individuals with the chimeric tetravalent yellow fever-dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia\u00ae [25]. Besides dengue, several other viruses have shown clinical or epidemiological evidence to support the notion of ADE. Two notable examples of vaccine-induced ADE are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [26], [27], [28], [29] and atypical measles [30,31], where severe disease was more prevalent following vaccination with inactivated virions. Unlike the above-mentioned viral diseases, there is neither clinical nor epidemiological evidence in humans to suggest ADE of CoV infection in severe disease. Re-infection with human CoVs has been observed and there is no report that sequential infection is more severe than primary infection. Likewise, there is also no evidence to suggest that the severity of SARS or MERS is linked to baseline cross-reactive CoV antibodies [32].",

            "text": "ADE starts when antibody-bound virus binds activating Fc receptors to initiate Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis. This process facilitates virus entry into Fc receptor-expressing monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. However, binding to activating Fc receptors alone is insufficient for ADE. This is because activating Fc receptors trigger signaling molecules that also induce interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) expression, independent of type-I IFN [33]. ISGs have potent antiviral activities. Consequently, for ADE to occur, viruses must evolve ways to repress such antiviral responses in target cells. For instance, ADE of DENV infection is also dependent on binding of DENV to a co-receptor, the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) [34]. Signaling from LILRB1 inhibits the pathway that induces ISG expression to create an intracellular environment favorable for viral replication [34], [35], [36]. Moreover, we have recently reported that DENV has, in addition to binding LILRB1, also evolved other ways to fundamentally alter the host cell response during antibody-mediated infection, to favor viral replication [37]. Consequently, viruses that exploit ADE must (1) target Fc receptor-expressing cells for infection and (2) have evolved mechanisms to overcome the activating Fc receptor triggered antiviral and other responses in myeloid-derived cells [23]. For viruses to evolve such abilities, Fc receptor-expressing cells must be their primary target so that positive selection can take place. However, currently SARS-CoV-2 has thus far been found to infect angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing epithelial cells [38]. Further studies will be needed to determine the potential of SARS-CoV-2 in infecting myeloid-derived cells [39] and, if any, the role of ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the clinical pathogenesis of Covid-19.",

However, vaccines against viruses such as RSV displayed similar enhanced immunopathology post-vaccination. Antibody-mediated effector pathways have been postulated to be the cause of the enhanced immunopathology [42]. Besides binding to antigen and activating Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis, antibodies also elicit a number of Fc-mediated responses, namely complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Such Fc-mediated effector pathways are generally meant to protect the host by clearing infected cells and recruiting immune cells to sites of infection [43,44]. However, an aberrant, over-stimulated Fc-mediated effector response can also lead to severe immunopathology and damage [42,43]. For example, a study observed that anti-Spike protein IgG antibody from severe SARS patients and from rhesus macaques immunized with a modified Ankara vaccinia vectored SARS CoV vaccine led to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of inflammatory macrophages in the lung parenchyma [41]. The exact mechanism of this immune recruitment is, however, unclear. Hence, a direct link between immunopathology and antibody-dependent complement activation or ADCC during CoV infections has not yet been established.",

Moreover, the kinetics of antibody response is also known to be influenced by viral load [45] and innate immune responses [46].

The vaccines for RSV and measles that could give rise to ADE were both formalin-inactivated vaccines that generated Th2-skewed responses [62]. Similar evidence has been observed in animal studies with CoV vaccine candidates, where vaccines that skew towards a Th1 response elicited protection against both viral infection and immunopathology [56,63]. Vaccines that stimulate Th1 immunity with a strong T cell response component appears to be the way forward. Table 2\nsummarizes the evidence that T cells may mitigate the risk of immune enhancement in other viral infections. However, an important point of consideration is that the elicitation of T cell responses is not a panacea for vaccine development, as excessive T cell responses can also result in immunopathology [64,65].",

There are likely major differences between vaccine-induced vs infection-induced antibodies. It is well known that innate immune response drives adaptive immune responses [46,66,67]. As SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to induce cytokine and chemokine expression, convalescent Covid-19 patients would likely produce antibodies that are qualitatively and quantitatively different to those elicited by vaccination alone. Although vaccines could also elicit innate immune responses, the magnitude would likely be significantly lower than those found in acutely ill Covid-19 patients since the disease is probably mediated by a pro-inflammatory cytokine response [68]. Moreover, the antigenic burden of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection can be expected to be significantly greater than those derived from vaccination. The level of such antigenic burden is known to drive adaptive immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers [45,69]. Consequently, extending findings from vaccine studies to infer the risk from hyperimmune globulin ignore the possibility of differences between the quality and titer of antibodies produced from infection and vaccination. This same explanation was also found to underpin how inactivated measles vaccination increases the risk of atypical pneumonia [31].",

Hyperimmune globulin treatment, besides inhibiting viral infection, could also downregulate pro-inflammatory responses and reduce disease severity in Covid-19 patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion is associated with anti-inflammatory responses [70], including those from viral infection [71]. Mechanistically, how this anti-inflammatory effect is mediated remains to be fully defined. High dose antibodies could bind a number of different inhibitory receptors, including the inhibitory Fc gamma receptor IIB (Fc\u03b3RIIB) [33,72], Fc\u03b3RIIC [73,74] or other receptors [75] to induce the anti-inflammatory response. Regardless of the mechanism, the presence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as high concentration of total antibodies could produce anti-inflammatory rather than the postulated immunopathology enhancement effects in Covid-19 patients to improve prognosis.",
